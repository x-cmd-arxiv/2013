between these two kinds of discontinuities is then studied with the help of

cosmological evolutions different from either the recollapse into a Big Crunch
or exponential de Sitter expansion. The newly arising singularities may
represent true endpoints of the evolution or allow for the extension of
geodesics through them. In the latter case the components of the Riemann tensor
representing tidal forces diverge. Sudden Future Singularities (SFS) occur at
finite time, finite scale factor and finite Hubble parameter, only the
deceleration parameter diverges. The energy density of a perfect fluid is
regular and its pressure diverges at the SFS. A particular SFS, the Big Brake
occurs when the energy density vanishes and the expansion arrives at a full
stop at the singularity. Such scenarios are generated by either a particular
scalar field (the tachyon field) or the anti-Chaplygin gas. By adding matter to
these models, an unwanted feature appears: at the finite scale factor of the
SFS the energy density of matter remains finite, implying (for a spatially flat
universe) a finite Hubble parameter, hence finite expansion rate, rather then
full stop. The universe would further expand through the singularity, this
nevertheless seems forbidden as the energy density of the tachyonic field /
anti-Chaplygin gas would become ill-defined. This paradox is relieved in the
case of the anti-Chaplygin gas by redefining its energy density and pressure in
terms of distributions peaked on the singularity. The regular cosmological
quantities, continuous across the SFS are the energy density and the square of
the Hubble parameter; those allowing for a jump at the SFS are the Hubble
parameter and expansion rate (both being mirror-symmetric). The pressure and
the decelaration parameter will contain Dirac delta-function contributions
peaked on the SFS, however they anyhow would diverge at the singularity.

where given a family of sets of size at most k one should select a maximum size
subfamily of pairwise disjoint sets. A special case of 3-Set Packing is the
well known 3-Dimensional Matching problem. Both problems belong to the Karp`s
list of 21 NP-complete problems. The best known polynomial time approximation
ratio for k-Set Packing is (k + eps)/2 and goes back to the work of Hurkens and
Schrijver [SIDMA`89], which gives (1.5 + eps)-approximation for 3-Dimensional
Matching. Those results are obtained by a simple local search algorithm, that
uses constant size swaps.
  The main result of the paper is a new approach to local search for k-Set
Packing where only a special type of swaps is considered, which we call swaps
of bounded pathwidth. We show that for a fixed value of k one can search the
space of r-size swaps of constant pathwidth in c^r poly(|F|) time. Moreover we
present an analysis proving that a local search maximum with respect to O(log
|F|)-size swaps of constant pathwidth yields a polynomial time (k + 1 +
eps)/3-approximation algorithm, improving the best known approximation ratio
for k-Set Packing. In particular we improve the approximation ratio for
3-Dimensional Matching from 3/2 + eps to 4/3 + eps.

successive perihelia in 2009, 2010 and 2012, using the NASA STEREO spacecraft.
Phaethon is clearly detected in 2009 and 2012, but not in 2010. In both former
years, Phaethon brightened unexpectedly by ~1 magnitude at large phase angles,
inconsistent with the ~1 magnitude of steady fading expected from a discrete,
macroscopic body over the same phase angle range. With a perihelion distance of
0.14 AU and surface temperatures up to ~1000 K, a thermal origin of this
anomalous brightening is strongly suspected. However, simple thermal emission
from Phaethon is too weak, by a factor >1000, to explain the brightening.
Neither can ice survive on this body, ruling out comet-like sublimation. Our
preferred explanation is that brightening occurs as a result of dust produced
and ejected from Phaethon, perhaps by thermal fracture and/or thermal
decomposition of surface minerals when near perihelion. A contribution from
prompt emission by oxygen released by desiccation of surface minerals cannot be
excluded. We infer an ejected mass of order 4x10^8 a_mm kg per outburst, where
a_mm is the mean dust radius in millimeters. For plausible dust radii, this

employed to study the inverse problem of getting the energies of the bound

the box size, carrying a study of the errors produced. Starting from the upper
level, fits to the synthetic data are carried out to determine the scattering

similar strategy using the effective range formula is considered with a
simultaneous fit to the two levels, one above and the other one below

allows to produce accurate results in the infinite volume starting from levels
of the box with errors far larger than the uncertainties obtained in the final

reconnection in the turbulent decay of sub-proton scale fluctuations using two
dimensional, particle-in-cell (PIC) plasma simulations with realistic
electron-proton mass ratio and a guide field out of the simulation plane. A
fluctuation power spectrum with approximately power law form is created down to
scales of order the electron gyroradius. In the dynamic magnetic field
topology, which gradually relaxes in complexity, we identify the signatures of
collisionless reconnection at sites of X-point field geometry. The reconnection
sites are generally associated with regions of strong parallel electron
temperature anisotropy. The evolving topology of magnetic field lines connected
to a reconnection site allows spatial mixing of electrons accelerated at
multiple, spatially separated reconnection regions. This leads to the formation
of multi-peaked velocity distribution functions with a strong parallel
temperature anisotropy. In a three-dimensional system, supporting the
appropriate wave vectors, the multi-peaked distribution functions would be
expected to be unstable to kinetic instabilities, contributing to dissipation.
The proposed mechanism of anisotropy formation is also relevant to space and
astrophysical systems where the evolution of the plasma is constrained by
linear temperature anisotropy instability thresholds. The presence of
reconnection sites leads to electron energy gain, nonlocal velocity space
mixing and the formation of strong temperature anisotropy; this is evidence of
an important role for reconnection in the dissipation of turbulent
fluctuations.

last decades. The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at BNL was the first
ever built heavy-ion collider. RHIC delivered its first collisions in June 2000
boosting the heavy-ion community. Impressive amount of experimental results has
been obtained. In November 2010, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN
delivered lead-lead collisions at unprecedented center-of-mass energies, 14
times larger than that at RHIC. Needless to say that the heavy-ion programs at
RHIC and LHC promise fascinating and exciting results in the next decade. In
the second part, a historical approach will be adopted, starting with the
notion of limiting temperature of matter introduced by Hagedorn in the 60's and
the discovery of the QCD asymptotic freedom in the 70's. The phase diagram of
hadronic matter, conceived as nowadays, will be shown together with the most
important predictions of lattice QCD calculations at finite temperature. In the
third part, the heavy-ion collisions at ultra-relativistic energies will be
proposed as a unique experimental method to study QGP in the laboratory, as
suggested by the Bjorken model. In the last part of these lectures, I will
present my biased review of the numerous experimental results obtained in the
last decade at RHIC which lead to the concept of strong interacting QGP, and
the first results obtained at LHC with the 2010 and 2011 PbPb runs. Finally,
the last section is devoted to refer to other lectures about quark gluon plasma
and heavy ion physics.

the particular underlying flavor model, but flavor-violating effects arise
dominantly in the up-sector and are strongly suppressed in Delta F =2

of wave function renormalization or Partial Compositeness, despite the

However, quantifying this additional information a priori, to decide whether a

simple systems where either the chemical master equation is computationally
tractable or a Gaussian approximation is appropriate. Here we show how the
information provided by distribution measurements can be approximated from the
first four moments of the underlying process. The derived formulas are
generally valid for any stochastic kinetic model including models that comprise
both intrinsic and extrinsic noise. This allows us to propose an optimal

employ to compare the utility of dual reporter and perturbation experiments for
separating extrinsic and intrinsic noise in a simple model of gene expression.

habitable zone changes as the luminosity and radius of the star evolves. The
duration of habitability for a planet located at a given distance from a star
is greatly affected by the characteristics of the host star. A quantification
of these effects can be used observationally in the search for life around
nearby stars. The longer the duration of habitability, the more likely it is
that life has evolved. The preparation of observational techniques aimed at
detecting life would benefit from the scientific requirements deduced from the
evolution of the habitable zone. We present a study of the evolution of the
habitable zone around stars of 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 M$_{\odot}$ for metallicities
ranging from Z=0.0001 to Z=0.070. We also consider the evolution of the
habitable zone from the pre-main sequence until the asymptotic giant branch is
reached. We find that metallicity strongly affects the duration of the
habitable zone for a planet as well as the distance from the host star where
the duration is maximized. For a 1.0 M$_{\odot}$ star with near Solar
metallicity, Z=0.017, the duration of the habitable zone is $>$10 Gyr at
distances 1.2 to 2.0 AU from the star, whereas the duration is $>$20 Gyr for
high metallicity stars (Z=0.070) at distances of 0.7 to 1.8 AU, and $\sim$4 Gyr
at distances of 1.8 to 3.3 AU for low metallicity stars (Z=0.0001).

fractured media has not appeared in the literature, to the best of our
knowledge. In this work, we present a three-phase fully compositional simulator
for fractured media, based on higher-order finite element methods. To achieve
computational efficiency, we invoke the cross-flow equilibrium (CFE) concept
between discrete fractures and a small neighborhood in the matrix blocks. We
adopt the mixed hybrid finite element (MHFE) method to approximate convective
Darcy fluxes and the pressure equation. This approach is the most natural
choice for flow in fractured media. The mass balance equations are discretized
by the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, which is perhaps the most efficient
approach to capture physical discontinuities in phase properties at the
matrix-fracture interfaces and at phase boundaries. In this work, we account
for gravity and Fickian diffusion. The modeling of capillary effects is
discussed in a separate paper. We present the mathematical framework, using the
implicit-pressure-explicit-composition (IMPEC) scheme, which facilitates
rigorous thermodynamic stability analyses and the computation of phase behavior
effects to account for transfer of species between the phases. A deceptively
simple CFL condition is implemented to improve numerical stability and
accuracy. We provide six numerical examples at both small and larger scales and

v_2-v_4 distributions for multiplicities similar to those observed in Pb+Pb
collisions at the LHC. The effects of the nonflow are evaluated using HIJING
simulation with and without a flow afterburner. The probability distribution of
v_n resulting only from nonflow in HIJING is nearly a Gaussian and can be
largely suppressed in the data-driven unfolding method used by the ATLAS
Collaboration. The residual nonflow effects have no appreciable impact on the
v_3 distributions, but are found to affect the tails of the v_2 and v_4
distributions; these effects manifest as a small simultaneous change in the
mean and standard deviation of the $v_n$ distributions. For the AMPT model,
which contains both flow fluctuations and nonflow effects, the reduced shape of
the extracted v_n distributions is found to be independent of pT in the low pT

requires extra electron/positron sources on top of the conventional cosmic ray
background, either from astrophysical sources or from dark matter
annihilation/decay. In this paper we try to figure out the nature of the extra
sources by fitting to the AMS-02 $e^+/(e^-+e^+)$ data, as well as the electron

adopt the GALPROP package to calculate the propagation of the Galactic cosmic

{\rm tension} between the AMS-02 $e^+/(e^-+e^+)$ data and the Fermi/HESS

extra sources than Fermi/HESS. Then we redo the fit without including the
Fermi/HESS data. In this case both the pulsars and dark matter
annihilation/decay can explain the AMS-02 data. The pulsar scenario has a soft

the starburst and peculiar kinematics prevalent in NGC 1569. A large,
half-degree diameter HI cloud was detected that shares the same position and

extend for about 1.5 degrees, which is 77 kpc at NGC 1569. There is a

suddenly faded away, becoming 2 magnitudes fainter in the V-band, and has
remained in this deep state since then. We report new optical and near-IR
photometry and spectroscopy obtained during the fading event. The system
appears much redder and fainter than it was in the bright state. Also, the 8.2d
photometric period continuously observed for more than 20 years is not seen
during most of the deep state. The analysis of the system's brightness and
colors suggests that the visual extinction on the line of sight has increased
by about 3-4 magnitudes in the deep state. At optical wavelengths, the system
appears to be dominated by scattered light, probably originating from the upper
surface layers of a highly inclined circumstellar disk. The profiles of the
Balmer lines have significantly changed as well, with the disappearance of a
central absorption component regularly observed in the bright state. We ascribe
this change to the scattering of the system's spectrum by circumstellar dust.
Noticeably, the mass accretion rate in the inner disk and onto the central star
has not changed as the system faded away. We conclude that the deepening of the
AA Tau system is due to a sudden increase of circumstellar dust extinction on
the line of sight without concomitant change in the accretion rate. We suggest
that the enhanced obscuration may be produced by a non-axisymmetric overdense
region in the disk, located at a distance of 7.7 AU or more, that was recently
brought on the line of sight by its keplerian motion around the central star.

every flat conformal torus which admits a circle packing whose contact graph
triangulates the torus has algebraic modulus, and (3) that if R is a compact
Riemann surface of genus at least 2, having constant curvature -1, which admits
a circle packing whose contact graph triangulates R, then R is isomorphic to
the quotient of the hyperbolic plane by a subgroup of PSL_2(real algebraic
numbers). The statement (1) is original, while (2) and (3) have been previously
proved in the Ph.D. thesis of McCaughan.
  Our first proof technique is to apply Tarski's Theorem, a result from model
theory, which says that if an elementary statement in the theory of real-closed
fields is true over one real-closed field, then it is true over any real closed
field. This technique works to prove (1) and (2). Our second proof technique is
via an algebraicity result of Thurston on finite co-volume discrete subgroups
of the orientation-preserving-isometry group of hyperbolic 3-space. This
technique works to prove (1). Our first and second techniques had not
previously been applied in this area. Our third and final technique is via a
lemma in real algebraic geometry, and was previously used by McCaughan to prove
(2) and (3). We show that in fact it may be used to prove (1) as well.

massive stellar envelope when the protoneutron star loses ~few*0.1Msun to
neutrino emission prior to collapse to a BH. Current and future wide-field,
high-cadence optical surveys make this an ideal time to discover and study
these events. Motivated by the unique parameter space probed by this scenario,
I discuss more broadly the range of properties expected for shock breakout

heated by stellar populations that are unrelated to the current star formation.
We use a simple model to qualitatively relate the increase of the SFR(70)
calibration coefficient with decreasing region size to the star formation

the observed H\alpha with the 70 \mu m emission, also for use in H{\sc ii}

of the tidal disruption event candidate Sw 1644+57. We find that, regardless of
the details of the equipartition scenario considered, the energy required to
produce the observed radio (i.e., energy in magnetic field and radio emitting
electrons) must increase by a factor of ~20 during the first 200 days. It then
saturates. This energy increase cannot be alleviated by a varying geometry of
the system. The radio data can be explained by: (i) An afterglow like emission
of the X-ray emitting narrow relativistic jet. The additional energy can arise
here from a slower moving material ejected in the first few days that gradually
catches up with the slowing down blast wave (Berger et al. 2012). However, this
requires at least ~4x10^{53} erg in the slower moving outflow. This is much
more than the energy of the fast moving outflow that produced the early X-rays
and it severely constrains the overall energy budget. (ii) Alternatively, the
radio may arise from a mildly relativistic quasi-spherical outflow. Here, the
energy for the radio emission increases with time to at least ~10^{51} erg
after 200 days. This scenario requires, however, a second X-ray emitting
collimated relativistic component. Given these results, it is worthwhile to
consider models in which the energy of the magnetic field and/or of the radio
emitting electrons increases with time without a continuous energy supply to
the blast wave. This can happen, for example, if the energy is injected
initially mostly in one form (Poynting flux or baryonic) and it is gradually
converted to the other form, leading to a deviation from equipartition. Another
intriguing possibility is that a gradually decreasing Inverse Compton cooling
modifies the synchrotron emission and leads to an increase of the available
energy in the radio emitting electrons (Kumar et al. 2013).

detail, along with prefatory consideration for time evolution using only the
171 A data. For each of the eight passbands, we characterize the emission and
derive outgassing rates where applicable. As material sublimates from the
nucleus and is immersed in coronal plasma, it rapidly ionizes through charge
states seldom seen in this environment. The AIA data show four stages of oxygen
ionization (O III - O VI) along with C IV, while XRT likely captured emission
from O VII, a line typical of the corona. With a nucleus of at least several
hundred meters upon approach to a perihelion that brought the comet to within
0.2 solar radii of the photosphere, Lovejoy was the most significant sungrazer
in recent history. Correspondingly high outgassing rates on the order of
10^32.5 oxygen atoms per second are estimated. Assuming that the neutral oxygen
comes from water, this translates to a mass-loss rate of about 9.5E9 g/s, and
based only on the 171 A observations, we find a total mass loss of
approximately 10^13 g over the AIA egress. Additional and supporting analyses
include a differential emission measure to characterize the coronal
environment, consideration for the opening angle, and a comparison of the

interpreted as evidence for the total energy output increasing with time. We
show in this work that flat lightcurves do not require addition of energy to
decelerating external shock (which produced radio and mm emission via
synchrotron process), instead the flat behavior is due to inverse-Compton
cooling of electrons by x-ray photons streaming through the external shock; the
higher x-ray flux at earlier times cools electrons more rapidly thereby
reducing the emergent synchrotron flux, and this effect weakens as the x-ray
flux declines with time.

show the absence of enhancement at any order. We complement the proof by an
explicit calculation of the power spectrum at two-loop order, and by further
numerical checks at higher orders. Using these insights, we argue that the
modification of the power spectrum from soft modes corresponds at most to
logarithmic corrections. Finally, we discuss the asymptotic behavior in the

chiral p-wave superconductor or equivalent material. The amplitude for Majorana
fermions to tunnel between a pair of vortices is found to necessarily depend on
the background superconducting phase profile; it is found to be proportional to
the sine of half the difference between the phases at the two vortices. Using
this result we study tight-binding models of Majorana fermions in vortices
arranged in triangular or square lattices. In both cases we find that the
aforementioned phase-tunneling relationship leads to the creation of
superlattices where the Majorana fermions form macroscopically degenerate
localizable flat bands at zero energy, in addition to other dispersive bands.
This finding suggests that tunneling processes in these vortex arrays do not
change the energies of a finite fraction of Majorana fermions, contrary to
previous expectation. The presence of flat Majorana bands, and hence
less-than-expected decoherence in these vortex arrays, bodes well for the
prospects of topological quantum computation with large numbers of Majorana

as very large collections of small, dense social graphs -- these range from
sets of social groups, events, or collaboration projects to the vast collection
of graph neighborhoods in large social networks. A natural question is how to
usefully define a domain-independent coordinate system for such a collection of
graphs, so that the set of possible structures can be compactly represented and
understood within a common space. In this work, we draw on the theory of graph
homomorphisms to formulate and analyze such a representation, based on
computing the frequencies of small induced subgraphs within each graph. We find
that the space of subgraph frequencies is governed both by its combinatorial
properties, based on extremal results that constrain all graphs, as well as by
its empirical properties, manifested in the way that real social graphs appear
to lie near a simple one-dimensional curve through this space.
  We develop flexible frameworks for studying each of these aspects. For
capturing empirical properties, we characterize a simple stochastic generative
model, a single-parameter extension of Erdos-Renyi random graphs, whose
stationary distribution over subgraphs closely tracks the concentration of the
real social graph families. For the extremal properties, we develop a tractable
linear program for bounding the feasible space of subgraph frequencies by
harnessing a toolkit of known extremal graph theory. Together, these two
complementary frameworks shed light on a fundamental question pertaining to
social graphs: what properties of social graphs are 'social' properties and
what properties are 'graph' properties?
  We conclude with a brief demonstration of how the coordinate system we
examine can also be used to perform classification tasks, distinguishing
between social graphs of different origins.

modeled with equal-mass components. Using a series of direct $N$-body
simulations, we investigate the dynamical evolution of star clusters with mass
functions, especially their core collapse time. Multi-mass clusters tend to
behave like systems with a smaller number of particles, which we call the
effective number of particles ($N_{eff}$) and for which $N_{eff} = M/m_{max}$
(here $M$ and $m_{max}$ are the total cluster mass and the mass of the most
massive star in the cluster, respectively). We find that the time of core
collapse is inversely proportional to the mass of the most massive star in the
cluster and analytically confirm that this is because the core collapse of
clusters with a mass function proceeds on the dynamical friction timescale of
the most massive stars. As the mass of the most massive star increases,
however, the core-collapse time, which is observed as a core bounce of the
cluster core from the evolution of the core density or core radius, becomes
ambiguous. We find that in that case the total binding energy of the hard
binaries gives a good diagnosis for determining the moment of core collapses.
Based on the results of our simulations, we argue that the core bounce becomes
ambiguous when the mass of the most massive star exceeds 0.1\% of the total
mass of the cluster.

before as a mechanism for contracting embedded stellar clusters, by dissipating
their energy. This would locally raise the SFE which might then allow bound
clusters to form. Noticing that dynamical friction is inherently capable of
producing mass segregation, since here, the dissipation rate is proportional to
the mass of the body experiencing the force, we explore further, some of the
details and implications of such a scenario, vis-a-vis observations. Making
analytical approximations, we obtain a boundary value for the density of a star
forming clump of given mass, such that, stellar clusters born in clumps which
have densities higher than this, could emerge bound after gas loss, and for a
clump of given mass and density, we find a critical mass such that,
subcondensations with larger masses than this could suffer significant
segregation within the clump.

constant $\lambda$. We find that, at cubic order, the interaction Hamiltonian
receives contributions from four terms built of the 3-dimensional Ricci tensor
$R_{ij}$ of the leaves $t = $ constant. In particular, the 3D Ricci scalar $R$
yields the same $k$-dependence as that in general relativity, but with
different magnitude due to coupling with the $U(1)$ field $A$ and a UV history.
Interestingly, the two terms $R_{ij}R^{ij}$ and
$\left(\nabla^{i}R^{jk}\right)\left(\nabla_{i}R_{jk}\right)$ exhibit peaks at
the squeezed limit. We show that this is due to the effects of the polarization
tensors. The signal generated by the fourth term, $R^i_j R^j_k R^k_i$, favors
the equilateral shape when spins of the three tensor fields are the same, but
peaks in between the equilateral and squeezed limits when spins are mixed. The
consistency with the recently-released Planck observations on non-Gaussianity
is also discussed and is found that $\left(H/M_*\right)^2\left(H/M_{pl}\right)

general, the stellar masses of the sample agree well with the stellar mass to
halo mass relation inferred from abundance matching techniques for redshifts
z=0-4. There is however a tendency to overproduce stars at z>4 and to
underproduce them at z<0.5 in the least massive haloes. Overly high SFRs at z<1
for the most massive haloes are likely connected to the lack of AGN feedback in
our model. The simulated sample also shows reasonable agreement with observed
star formation rates, sizes, gas fractions and gas-phase metallicities at
z=0-3. Remaining discrepancies can be connected to deviations from predictions
for star formation histories from abundance matching. At z=0, the model
galaxies show realistic morphologies, stellar surface density profiles,
circular velocity curves and stellar metallicities, but overly flat metallicity
gradients. 15 out of 16 of our galaxies contain disk components with kinematic

matches that from the wind flux fraction derived from the two component fits to
the interferometry. We find evidence of significant near-infrared flux

variations in the H-alpha emission flux from the wind. Future interferometric

or a dot product, between an incoming data stream and a signal template. While
such a correlation results in an ongoing estimate of the magnitude of the
signal in the data stream, it does not directly indicate the presence or
absence of a signal. Instead, the problem of signal detection is one of
model-selection. Here we explore the use of the Bayesian odds-ratio (OR), which
is the ratio of posterior probabilities of a signal-plus-noise model over a
noise-only model. We demonstrate this method by applying it to simulated
electroencephalographic (EEG) signals based on the P300 response, which is
widely used in both Brain Computer Interface (BCI) and Brain Machine Interface
(BMI) systems. The efficacy of this algorithm is demonstrated by comparing the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of the OR-based (logOR) filter
to the usual correlation method where we find a significant improvement in P300
detection. The logOR filter promises to improve the accuracy and speed of the
detection of evoked brain responses in BCI/BMI applications as well the
detection of template signals in general.

our previous simulations by including a different stellar-particle formation
algorithm, which allows them to have masses corresponding to single stars
rather than to small clusters, and with a mass distribution following a
near-Salpeter stellar IMF. We also employ a simplified radiative-transfer
algorithm that allows the stellar particles to feed back on the medium at a
rate that depends on their mass and the local density. Our results are as
follows: a) Contrary to the results from our previous study, where all stellar
particles injected energy at a rate corresponding to a star of ~ 10 Msun, the
dense gas is now completely evacuated from 10-pc regions around the stars
within 10-20 Myr, suggesting that this feat is accomplished essentially by the
most massive stars. b) At the scale of the whole numerical simulations, the
dense gas mass is reduced by up to an order of magnitude, although star
formation (SF) never shuts off completely, indicating that the feedback
terminates SF locally, but new SF events continue to occur elesewhere in the
clouds. c) The SF efficiency (SFE) is maintained globally at the ~ 10% level,
although locally, the cloud with largest degree of focusing of its accretion
flow reaches SFE ~ 30%. d) The virial parameter of the clouds approaches unity
before the stellar feedback begins to dominate the dynamics, becoming much
larger once feedback dominates, suggesting that clouds become unbound as a
consequence of the stellar feedback. e) The erosion of the filaments that feed
the star-forming clumps produces chains of isolated dense blobs reminiscent of
those observed in the vicinity of the dark globule B68.

to get new range of pixels 0..51. Basically, the reminder of each number that

then a 4-by-4 window size has been implemented to accommodate the proposed

could be embedded secretly from the stego image. The previous discussion must
be applied separately for each of the R, G, and B arrays. Moreover, a stego-key
could be combined with the proposed algorithm to make it difficult for any

state in the delocalization regime to a macroscopic cat-like state with fully

of the learning process for domain adaptation, and then apply the derived
bounds to analyze the asymptotical convergence of the learning process. Without
loss of generality, we consider two kinds of representative domain adaptation:
one is with multiple sources and the other is combining source and target data.
  In particular, we use the integral probability metric to measure the
difference between two domains. For either kind of domain adaptation, we
develop a related Hoeffding-type deviation inequality and a symmetrization
inequality to achieve the corresponding generalization bound based on the
uniform entropy number. We also generalized the classical McDiarmid's
inequality to a more general setting where independent random variables can
take values from different domains. By using this inequality, we then obtain
generalization bounds based on the Rademacher complexity. Afterwards, we
analyze the asymptotic convergence and the rate of convergence of the learning
process for such kind of domain adaptation. Meanwhile, we discuss the factors
that affect the asymptotic behavior of the learning process and the numerical
experiments support our theoretical findings as well.

(ISM) clouds as a way to explain observations of large parts of galaxies. To
compare such models to observations, one must understand how to translate
between surface densities observed averaging over large (~kpc) scales and
surface densities on the scale of individual clouds (~pc scale), which are
treated by models. We define a ""clumping factor"" that captures this translation
as the ratio of the mass-weighted surface density, which is often the quantity
of physical interest, to the area-weighted surface density, which is observed.
We use high spatial resolution (sub-kpc) maps of CO and HI emission from nearby
galaxies to measure the clumping factor of both atomic and molecular gas. The
molecular and atomic ISM exhibit dramatically different degrees of clumping. As
a result, the ratio H2/HI measured at ~kpc resolution cannot be trivially
interpreted as a cloud-scale ratio of surface densities. HI emission appears
very smooth, with a clumping factor of only ~1.3. Based on the scarce and
heterogeneous high resolution data available, CO emission is far more clumped
with a widely variable clumping factor, median ~7 for our heterogeneous data.
Our measurements do not provide evidence for a universal mass-weighted surface
density of molecular gas, but also cannot conclusively rule out such a
scenario. We suggest that a more sophisticated treatment of molecular ISM
structure, one informed by high spatial resolution CO maps, is needed to link
cloud-scale models to kpc-scale observations of galaxies.

aimed at studying complex systems with competition in their generic form.
Although the concept of abstract competition has been derived from a specific
field - modelling of mixing in turbulent reacting flows - this concept is,
generally, not attached to a specific phenomenon or application. Two classes of
competition rules, transitive and intransitive, need to be distinguished.
Transitive competitions are shown to be consistent (at least qualitatively)
with thermodynamic principles, which allows for introduction of special
competitive thermodynamics. Competitive systems can thus be characterised by
thermodynamic quantities (such as competitive entropy and competitive
potential), which determine that the predominant direction of evolution of the
system is directed towards higher competitiveness. There is, however, an
important difference: while conventional thermodynamics is constrained by its
zeroth law and is fundamentally transitive, the transitivity of competitive
thermodynamics depends on the transitivity of the competition rules. The
analogy with conventional thermodynamics weakens as competitive systems become
more intransitive, while strongly intransitive competitions can display types
of behaviour associated with complexity: competitive cooperation and leaping
cycles. Results of simulations demonstrating complex behaviour in abstract
competitions are presented in the electronic supplementary material (ESM).

investigates the conflict between the two in an area where city growth is
threatening a protected wetland area. We develop a stochastic cellular
automaton model for urban growth and apply it to the Vecht area surrounding the
city of Hilversum in the Netherlands, using topographic maps covering the past
150 years. We investigate the dependence of the urban growth pattern on the
values associated with the protected wetland and other types of landscape
surrounding the city. The conflict between city growth and wetland protection
is projected to occur before 2035, assuming full protection of the wetland. Our
results also show that a milder protection policy, allowing some of the wetland
to be sacrificed, could be beneficial for maintaining other valuable
landscapes. This insight would be difficult to achieve by other analytical
means. We conclude that even slight changes in usage priorities of landscapes
can significantly affect the landscape distribution in near future. Our results
also point to the importance of a protection policy to take the value of
surrounding landscapes and the dynamic nature of urban areas into account.

properties. Here we report a fourfold oscillation in the anisotropic magneto
resistance (AMR) and the observation of planar Hall effect (PHE) at the
LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ heterointerface. We evaluate the carrier confinement
effects on the AMR and find that the fourfold oscillation appears only for the
case of 2DEG system while it is twofold for the 3D system. As the fourfold
oscillation fits well to the phenomenological model for a cubic symmetry
system, we attribute this oscillation to the anisotropy in the magnetic
scattering arising from the interaction of electrons with the localized
magnetic moments coupled to the crystal symmetry. The AMR behavior is further
found to be sensitive to applied gate electric field, emphasizing the
significance of spin-orbit coupling at the interface. These confinement effects
suggest that the magnetic interactions are predominant at the interface, and
the gate electric field modulation of AMR suggest the possible gate tunable
magnetic interactions in these systems. The observed large PHE further
indicates that the in plane nature of magnetic ordering arises from the
in-plane Ti 3dxy orbitals.

us to constrain not only the accretion disk half-light radius r_1/2, but the
power-law slope \xi\ of the size-wavelength relation r_1/2 ~ \lambda^\xi. With
a logarithmic prior on the source size, the (observed-frame) R-band half-light
radius log(r_1/2/cm) is 16.0+0.3-0.4, and the slope \xi\ is 1.0+0.30-0.56. We
put upper limits on the source size in soft (0.4-1.2 keV) and hard (1.2-8 keV)
X-ray bands, finding 95% upper limits on log (r_1/2/cm) of 15.33 in both bands.
A linear prior yields somewhat larger sizes, particularly in the X-ray bands.
For comparison, the gravitational radius, using a black hole mass estimated
using the H\beta\ line, is log(r_g/cm) = 13.94. We find that the accretion disk
is probably close to face-on, with cos i = 1.0 being four times more likely

the stars in the foreground lensing galaxy, the direction of the transverse

quadrupolar coupling constant, $\nu_Q$ increases continuously with the decrease

Knight shift and spin lattice relaxation rate (1/T1) in the paramagnetic state
of NdCoPO indicate that the differences between LaCoPO and NdCoPO with SmCoPO

of 4f electrons. Nuclear spin lattice relaxation time (T1) in NdCoPO shows weak
anisotropy at 300 K. Using self consistent renormalization (SCR)theory of

the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) dust in carbon-rich AGB

disk galaxies with different total masses in this preliminary study. The
principle results are as follows: The star formation histories of disk galaxies
can be regulated by the time evolution of interstellar dust, mainly because the
formation rates of H_2 can be controlled by dust properties. The observed
correlation between dust-to-gas-ratios (D) and gas-phase oxygen abundances (A_O
= 12+log(O/H)) can be reproduced reasonably well in the present models. The
disks show negative radial gradients (i.e., larger in inner regions) of H_2
fraction (f_H2), PAH-to-dust mass ratio (f_PAH), D, and A_O and these gradients
evolve with time. The surface-mass densities of dust (Sigma_dust) are
correlated more strongly with the total surface gas densities than with those
of H_2. Local gaseous regions with higher D are more likely to have higher f_H2
in individual disks and total H_2 masses correlate well with total dust masses.
More massive disk galaxies are more likely to have higher D, f_PAH, and f_H2

formation histories in the metallicity-dependent and dust-dependent star

the hadronic scenario fails to reproduce experimental yields of antibaryons
(strange and nonstrange), starting already from lower SPS energies, i.e.
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}>$ 5 GeV. Moreover, at energies above the top SPS one, i.e.
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}>$ 17.4 GeV, the mid-rapidity densities predicted by the hadronic
scenario considerably exceed the available RHIC data on all species. At the
same time the deconfinement-transition scenarios reasonably agree (to a various
extent) with all the data. The present analysis demonstrates certain advantage
of the deconfinement-transition EoS's. However, all scenarios fail to reproduce
the strangeness enhancement in the incident energy range near 30A GeV (i.e. a
horn anomaly in the $K^+/\pi^+$ ratio) and yields of $\phi$-mesons at 20A--40A
GeV.

Two cubes $[0,1)^d+t$, $[0,1)^d+s$ are called a twin pair if their closures

Keller conjectured that in every cube tiling of R^d there is a twin pair.
Keller's conjecture is true for dimensions $d\leq 6$ and false for all
dimensions $d\geq 8$. For $d=7$ the conjecture is still open. Let $x\in R^d$,
$i\in [d]$, and let L(T,x,i) be the set of all $i$th coordinates $t_i$ of

Keller's conjecture is true in dimension seven for cube tilings $[0,1)^7+T$ for
which $r^-(T)\leq 2$. In the present paper we show that it is also true for
$d=7$ if $r^+(T)\geq 6$. Thus, if $[0,1)^d+T$ is a counterexample to Keller's
conjecture in dimension seven, then $r^-(T),r^+(T)\in \{3,4,5\}$.

properties for which we have spatially-resolved optical spectra. We focus on
some indicators of star formation activity and dust attenuation for spiral
galaxies that have been widely used in previous work on galaxy evolution. We
have used 104 spiral galaxies from the CALIFA survey for which 2D spectroscopy
with complete spatial coverage is available. From the 3D cubes we have derived
growth curves of the most conspicuous Balmer emission lines (Halpha, Hbeta) for
circular apertures of different radii centered at the galaxy's nucleus after
removing the underlying stellar continuum. We find that the Halpha flux
(f(Halpha)) growth curve follows a well defined sequence with aperture radius
showing low dispersion around the median value. From this analysis, we derive
aperture corrections for galaxies in different magnitude and redshift
intervals. Once stellar absorption is properly accounted for, the
f(Halpha)/f(Hbeta) ratio growth curve shows a smooth decline, pointing towards
the absence of differential dust attenuation as a function of radius. Aperture
corrections as a function of the radius are provided in the interval
[0.3,2.5]R_50. Finally, the Halpha equivalent width (EW(Halpha)) growth curve
increases with the size of the aperture and shows a very large dispersion for
small apertures. This large dispersion prevents the use of reliable aperture
corrections for this quantity. In addition, this result suggests that
separating star-forming and quiescent galaxies based on observed EW(Halpha)
through small apertures is likely to result in low EW(Halpha) star-forming
galaxies begin classified as quiescent.

class of superconducting metamaterials that encompass the Josephson effect.
SQUID metamaterials acquire their electromagnetic properties from the resonant
characteristics of their constitutive elements, i.e., the individual rf SQUIDs,
which consist of a superconducting ring interrupted by a Josephson junction. We
investigate the response of a two-dimensional SQUID metamaterial to frequency
variation of an applied alternating magnetic field in the presence of disorder,
arising from critical current fluctuations of the Josephson elements; in
effect, the resonance frequencies of individual SQUIDs are distributed randomly
around a mean value. Bistability is observed in the total current-frequency
curves both in ordered and disordered SQUID metamaterials; moreover,
bistability is favoured by disorder through the improvement of synchronization
between SQUID oscillators. Relatively weak disorder widens significantly the
bistability region by helping the system to self-organize itself and leads to
nearly homogeneous states that change smoothly with varying frequency.
Moreover, the total current of the metamaterial is enhanced compared with that
of uncoupled SQUIDs, through the synergetic action of coupling and
synchronization. Multistability of nearly homogeneous states allows the
metamaterial to exhibit different magnetic responses corresponding to different
values of the magnetic permeability. At low power of the incident field,
high-current states exhibit extreme diamagnetic properties corresponding to
negative magnetic permeability in a narrow frequency region.

the orbital period of 1.55 d, and by the rotation of the compact object with a
spin period of 13.2 s. In 2011 we obtained six short XMM-Newton observations
centered at orbital phase 0.75, in order to study the system during the
eclipse, and spaced at increasingly long time intervals in order to obtain an
accurate measure of the spin-period evolution through phase-connected timing.
The duration of the eclipse ingress and egress, 500 s, indicates the presence
of an X-ray emitting region with dimensions of the order of a few 10^4 km,
surrounding the pulsar and probably due to scattering in the companion's wind.
We derived an upper limit on the spin-period derivative |Pdot|<6x10^-15 s/s,
more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the previously available value.
Significant X-ray emission is detected also during the 1.2 hours-long eclipse,
with a luminosity of about 3x10^30 erg/s. The eclipse spectrum shows prominent
emission lines of H- and He-like nitrogen, an overabundant element in HD 49798.
These findings support the suggestion that the X-ray emission observed during

emission in the stellar winds of massive O stars are also at work in the much
weaker winds of hot subdwarfs.

cognitive radio (CR) environments is presented, the Lorenz equilibrium (LE).
Both Nash and Pareto solution concepts have limitations when applied to real
world problems. Nash equilibrium (NE) rarely ensures maximal payoff and it is
frequently Pareto inefficient. The Pareto set is usually a large set of
solutions, often too hard to process. The Lorenz equilibrium is a subset of
Pareto efficient solutions that are equitable for all players and ensures a
higher payoff than the Nash equilibrium. LE induces a selection criterion of
NE, when several are present in a game (e.g. many-player discrete games) and
when fairness is an issue. Besides being an effective NE selection criterion,
the LE is an interesting game theoretical situation per se, useful for CR
interaction analysis.

other (often more than one) metastable phases. These may be polymorphic solids
or even liquid phases. In such cases, nucleation of the solid phase from the
melt may be facilitated by the metastable phase because the latter can ""wet""
the interface between the parent and the daughter phases, even though there may
be no signature of the existence of metastable phase in the thermodynamic
properties of the parent liquid and the stable solid phase. Straightforward
application of classical nucleation theory (CNT) is flawed here as it
overestimates the nucleation barrier since surface tension is overestimated (by
neglecting the metastable phases of intermediate order) while the thermodynamic
free energy gap between daughter and parent phases remains unchanged. In this
work we discuss a density functional theory (DFT) based statistical mechanical
approach to explore and quantify such facilitation. We construct a simple order
parameter dependent free energy surface that we then use in DFT to calculate
(i) the order parameter profile, (ii) the overall nucleation free energy
barrier and (iii) the surface tension between the parent liquid and the
metastable solid and also parent liquid and stable solid phases. The theory
indeed finds that the nucleation free energy barrier can decrease significantly
in the presence of wetting. This approach can provide a microscopic explanation
of Ostwald step rule and the well-known phenomenon of ""disappearing polymorphs""
that depends on temperature and other thermodynamic conditions. Theory reveals
a diverse scenario for phase transformation kinetics some of which may be

weighting of non-aberrant SPI data (visibility, triple product), fine spectral
calibration (sub-pixel level), accurate and robust determinations of stellar
diameters for calibrator sources (and their uncertainties as well), correction
for the degradations of the interferometer response in visibility and triple
product, calculation of the Centro-Symmetry Parameter (CSP) from the calibrated
triple product, fit of parametric chromatic models on SPI observables, to
extract model parameters. SPIDAST is currently applied to the scientific study
of 18 cool giant and supergiant stars, observed with the VLTI/AMBER facility at
medium resolution in the K band. Because part of their calibrators have no

Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stt1088",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stellar bars are the most common non-axisymmetric structures in galaxies and
their impact on the evolution of disc galaxies at all cosmological times can be
significant. Classical theory predicts that stellar discs are stabilized
against bar formation if embedded in massive spheroidal dark matter halos.
However, dark matter halos have been shown to facilitate the growth of bars
through resonant gravitational interaction. Still, it remains unclear why some
galaxies are barred and some are not. In this study, we demonstrate that
co-rotating (i.e., in the same sense as the disc rotating) dark matter halos
with spin parameters in the range of $0 \le \lambda_{\mathrm{dm}} \le 0.07$ -
which are a definite prediction of modern cosmological models - promote the
formation of bars and boxy bulges and therefore can play an important role in
the formation of pseudobulges in a kinematically hot dark matter dominated disc
galaxies. We find continuous trends for models with higher halo spins: bars
form more rapidly, the forming slow bars are stronger, and the final bars are
longer. After 2 Gyrs of evolution, the amplitude of the bar mode in a model
with $\lambda_{\mathrm{dm}} = 0.05$ is a factor of ~6 times higher, A_2/A_0 =
0.23, than in the non-rotating halo model. After 5 Gyrs, the bar is ~ 2.5 times
longer. The origin of this trend is that more rapidly spinning (co-rotating)
halos provide a larger fraction of trailing dark matter particles that lag
behind the disc bar and help growing the bar by taking away its angular
momentum by resonant interactions. A counter-rotating halo suppresses the
formation of a bar in our models. We discuss potential consequences for forming
galaxies at high-redshift and present day low mass galaxies which have
converted only a small fraction of their baryons into stars.

that, via cooperative binding, the abstract Tile Assembly Model is indeed
intrinsically universal. Noncooperative self-assembly, also known as
""temperature 1"", is where tiles bind to each other if they match on one or more
sides, whereas cooperative binding requires binding on multiple sides. Our
result shows that the change from single- to multi-sided binding qualitatively
improves the kinds of dynamics and behavior that these models of nanoscale
self-assembly are capable of. Our lower bound on simulation power holds in both
two and three dimensions; the latter being quite surprising given that
three-dimensional noncooperative tile assembly systems simulate Turing
machines. On the positive side, we exhibit a three-dimensional noncooperative
self-assembly tile set capable of simulating any two-dimensional noncooperative
self-assembly system.
  Our negative result can be interpreted to mean that Turing universal
algorithmic behavior in self-assembly does not imply the ability to simulate
arbitrary algorithmic self-assembly processes.

shown effective for representing and reasoning about a variety of probability
reasoning tasks. However, the lack of probability aggregates, e.g. {\em
expected values}, in the language of disjunctive hybrid probability logic
programs (DHPP) disallows the natural and concise representation of many
interesting problems. In this paper, we extend DHPP to allow arbitrary
probability aggregates. We introduce two types of probability aggregates; a
type that computes the expected value of a classical aggregate, e.g., the
expected value of the minimum, and a type that computes the probability of a
classical aggregate, e.g, the probability of sum of values. In addition, we
define a probability answer set semantics for DHPP with arbitrary probability
aggregates including monotone, antimonotone, and nonmonotone probability
aggregates. We show that the proposed probability answer set semantics of DHPP
subsumes both the original probability answer set semantics of DHPP and the
classical answer set semantics of classical disjunctive logic programs with
classical aggregates, and consequently subsumes the classical answer set
semantics of the original disjunctive logic programs. We show that the proposed
probability answer sets of DHPP with probability aggregates are minimal
probability models and hence incomparable, which is an important property for
nonmonotonic probability reasoning.

models adopt solar abundances throughout the model nebula, in contrast with

(UFOs) seen in nearby AGN, and the slower and less ionized winds of BAL QSOs.
The primary difference is the mass loss rate in the wind, which is ultimately
determined by the rate at which mass is fed towards the central supermassive
black hole (SMBH) on large scales. This is below the Eddington accretion rate
in most UFOs, and slightly super-Eddington in extreme UFOs such as PG1211+143,
but ranges up to $\sim 10-50$ times this in BAL QSOs. For UFOs this implies
black hole accretion rates and wind mass loss rates which are at most
comparable to Eddington, giving fast, highly-ionized winds. In contrast BAL QSO
black holes have mildly super-Eddington accretion rates, and drive winds whose
mass loss rates are significantly super-Eddington, and so are slower and less
ionized. This picture correctly predicts the velocities and ionization states
of the observed winds, including the recently-discovered one in SDSS
J1106+1939. We suggest that luminous AGN may evolve through a sequence from BAL
QSO through LoBAL to UFO-producing Seyfert or quasar as their Eddington factors
drop during the decay of a bright accretion event. LoBALs correspond to a
short-lived stage in which the AGN radiation pressure largely evacuates the
ionization cone, but before the large-scale accretion rate has dropped to the
Eddington value. We show that sub-Eddington wind rates would produce an $M -
\sigma$ relation lying above that observed. We conclude that significant SMBH
mass growth must occur in super-Eddington phases, either as BAL QSOs, extreme
UFOs, or obscured from direct observation.

the MACHO and MOA projects also provided us with additional data obtained in
1995--99 and 2000--2005, respectively. These data allowed us to analyse the
light curve of the object during its eruption, as well as the potential
variability of its progenitor. In the archives of several infrared surveys,
namely 2MASS, MSX, Spitzer, AKARI, WISE, and VVV, we found measurements of the
object, which allowed us to study the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the
object. We constructed a simple model of a star surrounded by a dusty envelope,
which was used to interpret the observed SED. Our analysis of the data clearly
shows that OGLE-2002-BLG-360 was most probably a red transient, i.e. an object
similar in nature to V838 Mon, whose eruption was observed in 2002. The SED in
all phases, i.e. progenitor, eruption, and remnant, was dominated by infrared
emission, which we interpret as evidence of dust formation in an intense mass
outflow. Since 2009 the object has been completely embedded in dust. We suggest
that the progenitor of OGLE-2002-BLG-360 was a binary, which had entered the
common-envelope phase a long time (at least decades) before the observed
eruption, and that the eruption resulted from the final merger of the binary
components. We point out similarities between OGLE-2002-BLG-360 and CK Vul,
whose eruption was observed in 1670--72, and this strengthens the hypothesis
that CK Vul was also a red transient.

at present the rate of new microarray studies submitted to public databases far
exceeds the rate of new RNA-seq studies. There is clearly a need for methods
that make it easier to combine data from different technologies. In this paper,
we propose a new method for processing RNA-seq data that yields gene expression
estimates that are much more similar to corresponding estimates from microarray
data, hence greatly improving cross-platform comparability. The method we call
PREBS is based on estimating the expression from RNA-seq reads overlapping the
microarray probe regions, and processing these estimates with microarray
summarisation algorithm RMA. Using paired microarray and RNA-seq samples from
TCGA LAML data set we show that PREBS expression estimates derived from RNA-seq
are more similar to microarray-based expression estimates than those from other
RNA-seq processing methods. In an experiment to retrieve paired microarray
samples from a database using an RNA-seq query sample, gene signatures defined
based on PREBS expression estimates were found to be much more accurate than
those from other methods. PREBS also allows new ways of using RNA-seq data,

disk galaxies. Our algorithm employs a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach
to explore the parameter space of a general family of dark matter profiles. We
improve upon previous analyses by considering a wider range of halo profiles
and by explicitly identifying cases in which the data are insufficient to break
the degeneracies between the model parameters. We demonstrate the robustness of
our algorithm using artificial data sets and show that reliable estimates of
the halo density profile can be obtained from data of comparable quality to
those currently available for low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies. We present
our results in terms of physical quantities which are constrained by the data,
and find that the logarithmic slope of the halo density profile at the radius
of the innermost data point of a measured rotation curve can be strongly
constrained in LSB ([Vstar/Vobs]max ~ 0.16) galaxies. High surface brightness
galaxies ([Vstar/Vobs]max ~ 0.79) require additional information on the
mass-to-light ratio of the stellar population - our approach naturally
identifies those galaxies for which this is necessary. We apply our method to
observed data for the dwarf irregular galaxy DDO 154 and recover a logarithmic
halo slope of -0.39 +- 0.11 at a radius of 0.14 kpc. Our analysis validates
earlier estimates which were based on the fitting of a limited set of
individual halo models, but constitutes a more robust constraint than was
possible using other techniques since it marginalises over a wide range of halo
profiles.

inventory of ELECTRA during the reactor life using the Total Monte Carlo
approach (TMC). Within the TENDL project the nuclear models input parameters
were randomized within their uncertainties and 740 Pu-239 nuclear data
libraries were generated. These libraries are used as inputs to reactor codes,
in our case SERPENT, to perform uncertainty analysis of nuclear reactor
inventory during burn-up. The uncertainty in the inventory determines
uncertainties in: the long-term radio-toxicity, the decay heat, the evolution
of reactivity parameters, gas pressure and volatile fission product content. In
this work, a methodology called fast TMC is utilized, which reduces the overall
calculation time. The uncertainty in the long-term radiotoxicity, decay heat,
gas pressure and volatile fission products were found to be insignificant.
However, the uncertainty of some minor actinides were observed to be rather
large and therefore their impact on multiple recycling should be investigated
further. It was also found that, criticality benchmarks can be used to reduce
inventory uncertainties due to nuclear data. Further studies are needed to
include fission yield uncertainties, more isotopes, and a larger set of
benchmarks.

modified Korteweg - de Vries equation with an initial function of the step
type. This function rapidly tends to zero as $x\to+\infty$ and to some positive
constant c as $x\to-\infty$. In 1989 E. Khruslov and V. Kotlyarov have found
that for a large time the solution breaks up into a train of asymptotic
solitons located in the domain $4c^2t-C_N \ln t<x\leq4c^2t$ ($C_N$ is a
constant). The number N of these solitons grows unboundedly as $t\to\infty$. In
2010 V. Kotlyarov and A. Minakov have studied temporary asymptotics of the
solution of the Cauchy problem on the whole line and have found that in the
domain $-6c^2 t<x<4c^2t$ this solution is described by a modulated elliptic
wave. We considere here the modulated elliptic wave in the domain $4c^2t-C_N
\ln t<x<4c^2t$. Our main result shows that the modulated elliptic wave also
breaks up into solitons, which are similar to the asymptotic solitons, but
differ from them in phase. It means that the modulated elliptic wave does not
represent the asymptotics of the solution in the domain $4c^2t-C_N \ln
t<x<4c^2t$. The correct asymptotic behavior of the solution is given by the
train of asymptotic solitons. However, in the asymptotic regime as $t\to\infty$
in the region $4c^2t-\frac{N+1/4}{c}\ln t<x<4c^2t-\frac{N-3/4}{c}\ln t$ we can
watch precisely a pair of solitons with numbers N. One of them is the
asymptotic soliton while the other soliton is generated from the elliptic wave.
Their phases become closer to each other for a large N, i.e. these solitons are
also close to each other. This result gives the answer on a very important
question about matching of the asymptotic formulas in the mentioned region
where the both formulas are well-defined. We have a new and earlier unknown
mechanism of matching of the asymptotics of the solution in the adjacent
regions.

focuses on two problems: firstly, consideration is given to effective
distributed storage technology in WSNs; secondly, we address how to repair the
data in failed storage nodes with less resource. For the first problem, we
propose a method to obtain a sparse generator matrix to construct network
codes, and this sparse generator matrix is proven to be the sparsest.
Benefiting from the sparse generator matrix, the energy consumption required to
implement distributed storage is reduced. For the second problem, we designed a
network coding-based iterative repair method, which adequately utilizes the
idea of re-encoding at intermediate nodes from network coding theory.
Benefiting from the re-encoding, the energy consumption required by data repair
is significantly reduced. Moreover, we provide an explicit lower bound of field
size required by this scheme, which implies that this scheme can work over a
very small field and the required computation overhead of coding is very low.
The simulation result verifies that by using our scheme, the total energy
consumption required to implement distributed storage system in WSNs can be
reduced on the one hand, and on the other hand, this method can also balance
energy consumption of the networks.

higher than 300 K. Nevertheless, most astrophysical studies are based on the
room-temperature optical constants of solids, such as corundum and spinel. A
more realistic approach is needed for these materials, especially in the
context of modeling late-type stars. We aimed at deriving sets of optical
constants of selected, astrophysically relevant oxide dust species with high
melting points. A high-temperature-high-pressure-cell and a Fourier-transform
spectrometer were used to measure reflectance spectra of polished samples. For
corundum (alpha-Al$_2$O$_3$), spinel (MgAl$_2$O$_4$), and alpha-quartz
(SiO$_2$), temperature-dependent optical constants were measured from 300 K up
to more than 900 K. Small particle spectra were also calculated from these
data. All three examined oxides show a significant temperature dependence of
their mid-IR bands. For the case of corundum, we find that the 13$\mu$m
emission feature - seen in the IR spectra of many AGB stars - can very well be
assigned to this mineral species. The best fit of the feature is achieved with
oblate corundum grains at mean temperatures around 550 K. Spinel remains a
viable carrier of the 13$\mu$m feature as well, but only for T < 300 K and
nearly spherical grain shapes. Under such circumstances, spinel grains may also
account for the 31.8$\mu$m band that is frequently seen in sources of the
13$\mu$m feature and which has not yet been identified with certainty.

CBMM, ingot niobium was explored as a possible material for superconducting
radiofrequency (SRF) cavity fabrication. The first single cell cavity from
large grain high purity niobium was fabricated and successfully tested at
Jefferson Lab in 2004. This pioneering work triggered research activities in
other SRF laboratories around the world. Large grain niobium became not only an
interesting alternative material for cavity builders, but also material
scientists and surface scientists were eager to participate in the development
of this material. Most of the original expectations for this material of being
less costly and allowing less expensive fabrication and treatment procedures at
the same performance levels in cavities have been met. Many single cell
cavities made from material of different suppliers have been tested
successfully and several multi-cell cavities have shown the performances
comparable to the best cavities made from standard poly-crystalline niobium.
Several 9-cell cavities fabricated by Research Instruments and tested at DESY
exceeded the best performing fine grain cavities with a record accelerating
gradient of Eacc = 45.6 MV/m. Recently- at JLab- by using a new furnace
treatment procedure a single cell cavity made of ingot niobium performed at a
remarkably high Q0-value (~5x10^10) at an accelerating gradient of ~20 MV/m, at
2K. Such performance levels push the state-of-the art of SRF technology to new
limits and are of great interest for future accelerators. This contribution
reviews the development of ingot niobium technology and attempts to make a case
for this material being the choice for future accelerators.

observations as giant dust rings surrounding their young host stars. More
accurate observations with ALMA have shown several of these rings to be in fact
asymmetric: they have lopsided shapes. It has been speculated that these rings
act as dust traps, which would make them important laboratories for studying
planet formation. It has been shown that an elongated giant vortex produced in
a disk with a strong viscosity jump strikingly resembles the observed
asymmetric rings.
  Aims. We aim to study a similar behavior for a disk in which a giant planet
is embedded. However, a giant planet can induce two kinds of asymmetries: (1) a
giant vortex, and (2) an eccentric disk. We studied under which conditions each
of these can appear, and how one can observationally distinguish between them.
This is important because only a vortex can trap particles both radially and
azimuthally, while the eccentric ring can only trap particles in radial
direction.
  Methods. We used the FARGO code to conduct the hydro-simulations. We set up a
disk with an embedded giant planet and took a radial grid spanning from 0.1 to
7 times the planet semi-major axis. We ran the simulations with various
viscosity values and planet masses for 1000 planet orbits to allow a fully
developed vortex or disk eccentricity. Afterwards, we compared the dust
distribution in a vortex-holding disk with an eccentric disk using dust
simulations.
  Results. We find that vorticity and eccentricity are distinguishable by
looking at the azimuthal contrast of the dust density. While vortices, as
particle traps, produce very pronounced azimuthal asymmetries, eccentric
features are not able to accumulate millimeter dust particles in azimuthal
direction, and therefore the asymmetries are expected to be modest.

synchronization. A propagation model is needed to estimate the ear-to-ear link
loss for such binaural hearing aids. The link loss is a critical parameter in a
link budget to decide the sensitivity of the transceiver. In this paper, we
have presented a model for the deterministic component of the ear-to-ear link
loss. The model takes into account the dominant paths having most of the power
of the creeping wave from the transceiver in one ear to the transceiver in
other ear and the effect of the protruding part of the outer ear called pinna.
Simulations are done to validate the model using in-the-ear (ITE) placement of
antennas at 2.45 GHz on two heterogeneous phantoms of different age-group and
body size. The model agrees with the simulations. The ear-to-ear link loss
between the antennas for the binaural hearing aids in the homogeneous SAM
phantom is compared with a heterogeneous phantom. It is found that the absence
of the pinna and the lossless shell in the SAM phantom underestimate the link
loss. This is verified by the measurements on a phantom where we have included
the pinnas fabricated by 3D-printing.

transition from an inactive to active phase as the strain amplitude is
increased. The inactive phase consists of no collisions/contacts between
particles in the steady state limit, while in the active phase collisions
persist. To investigate this system at higher densities, we construct and study
a conserved-particle-number contact process with novel three-body interactions,
which are potentially more likely than two-body interactions at higher
densities. For example, consider one active (diffusing) particle colliding with
two inactive (non-diffusing) particles such that they become active, in
addition to spontaneous inactivation. In mean-field, this system exhibits a
continuous dynamical phase transition belonging to the conserved directed
percolation universality class. Simulations on square lattices support the mean
field result. In contrast, the three-body interaction requiring two active
particles to activate one inactive particle exhibits a discontinuous
transition. Finally, inspired by kinetically-constrained models of the glass
transition, we investigate the ""caging effect"" at even higher particle
densities to look for a second dynamical phase transition back to an inactive
phase. Square lattice simulations suggest a continuous transition with a new
set of exponents differing from conserved directed percolation, i.e. a new
universality class for contact processes with conserved particle number.

temperature, and therefore the maximum achievable electron brightness, due to
heating just after emission into vacuum, applicable to dense relativistic or
nonrelativistic photoelectron beams. This heating is due to poorly screened
Coulomb interactions equivalent to disorder induced heating seen in ultracold
neutral plasmas. We first show that traditional analytic methods of Coulomb
collisions fail for the calculation of this strongly coupled heating. Instead,
we employ an N-body tree algorithm to compute the universal scaling of the
disorder induced heating in fully contained bunches, and show it to agree well
with a simple model utilizing the tabulated correlated energy of one component
plasmas. We also present simulations for beams undergoing Coulomb explosion at
the photocathode, and demonstrate that both the temperature growth and
subsequent cooling must be characterized by correlated effects, as well as
correlation-frozen dynamics. In either case, the induced temperature is found
to be of several meV for typical photoinjector beam densities, a significant
fraction of the intrinsic beam temperature of the coldest semiconductor
photocathodes. Thus, we expect disorder induced heating to become a major
limiting factor in the next generation of photoemission sources delivering
dense bunches and employing ultra-cold photoemitters.

the visibility of the ensuing Fermi-edge singularity despite weak absorption
strength. We find good agreement between experiment and renormalization group
theory, but only when we generalize the Anderson impurity model to include a

highlights the fact that an optically active dot acts as a tunable quantum

evidence for other-regarding preferences. Here we present a theory that
explains both, self-regarding and other-regarding preferences. Assuming
conditions promoting non-cooperative behaviour, we demonstrate that
intergenerational migration determines whether evolutionary competition results
in a `homo economicus' (showing self-regarding preferences) or a `homo
socialis' (having other-regarding preferences). Our model assumes spatially
interacting agents playing prisoner's dilemmas, who inherit a trait determining
`friendliness', but mutations tend to undermine it. Reproduction is ruled by
fitness-based selection without a cultural modification of reproduction rates.
Our model calls for a complementary economic theory for `networked minds' (the
`homo socialis') and lays the foundations for an evolutionarily grounded theory
of other-regarding agents, explaining individually different utility functions

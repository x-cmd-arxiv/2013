the structure of a staggered ladder, i.e., it is the superposition of a finite

of the nonintegrability of the system. This spectral structure is shown to have
distinct quantum-dynamical manifestations: A suppression of quantum resonances

interaction with counterions. We report on charge inversion and the related
reentrant condensation in solutions of globular proteins with different
multivalent metal cations. In particular, we focus on the changes in phase
behavior and charge regulation due to pH effects caused by hydrolysis of metal
ions. For several proteins and metal salts, charge inversion as measured by
electrophoretic light scattering is found to be a universal phenomenon, the
extent of which is dependent on the specific protein-salt combination.
Reentrant phase diagrams show a much narrower phase-separated regime for acidic
salts such as AlCl3 and FeCl3 compared to neutral salts such as YCl3 or LaCl3 .
The differences between acidic and neutral salts can be explained by the
interplay of pH effects and binding of the multivalent counterions. The
experimental findings are reproduced with good agreement by an analytical model
for protein charging taking into account ion condensation, metal ion hydrolysis
and interaction with charged amino acid side chains on the protein surface.
Finally, the relationship of charge inversion and reentrant condensation is
discussed, suggesting that pH variation in combination with multivalent cations
provides control over both attractive and repulsive interactions between
proteins.

Nambu-Goldstone boson's nature, the TD can be as light as the LHC boson that
has been discovered at around 125 GeV. We discuss the size of the TD mass and
the coupling properties relevant to the LHC study. It turns out that the TD
couplings to the standard model (SM) particles take the same form as those of
the SM Higgs boson, except the essentially distinguishable two ingredients: i)
the overall coupling strengths set by the decay constant related to the
spontaneous breaking of the scale invariance, which is in general not equal to
the electroweak scale; ii) the couplings to photons and gluons which can
include extra contributions from technifermion loops and hence can be enhanced
compared to the SM Higgs case. To be concrete, we take the one-family
technicolor model to explore the TD LHC phenomenology at 125 GeV. It is shown
that the TD gives the signal consistent with the currently reported LHC data,

Oversampling Strategies","27 pages, 5 figures",,,,"math.AP math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose oversampling strategies in the Generalized
Multiscale Finite Element Method (GMsFEM) framework. The GMsFEM, which has been
recently introduced in [12], allows solving multiscale parameter-dependent
problems at a reduced computational cost by constructing a reduced-order
representation of the solution on a coarse grid. The main idea of the method
consists of (1) the construction of snapshot space, (2) the construction of the
offline space, and (3) construction of the online space (the latter for
parameter-dependent problems). In [12], it was shown that the GMsFEM provides a
flexible tool to solve multiscale problems with a complex input space by
generating appropriate snapshot, offline, and online spaces. In this paper, we
develop oversampling techniques to be used in this context (see [19] where
oversampling is introduced for multiscale finite element methods). It is known
(see [19]) that the oversampling can improve the accuracy of multiscale
methods. In particular, the oversampling technique uses larger regions (larger
than the target coarse block) in constructing local basis functions. Our
motivation stems from the analysis presented in this paper which show that when
using oversampling techniques in the construction of the snapshot space and
offline space, GMsFEM will converge independent of small scales and
high-contrast under certain assumptions. We consider the use of multiple
eigenvalue problem to improve the convergence and discuss their relation to
single spectral problems that use oversampled regions. The oversampling
procedures proposed in this paper differ from those in [19]. In particular, the
oversampling domains are partially used in constructing local spectral
problems. We present numerical results and compare various oversampling
techniques in order to complement the proposed technique and analysis.

regression (GOCRE), to explore the relationship between a categorical outcome
and a set of massive variables. A set of orthogonal components are sequentially
constructed to account for the variation of the categorical outcome, and
together build up a generalized linear model (GLM). This algorithm can be
considered as an extension of the partial least squares (PLS) for GLMs, but
overcomes several issues of existing extensions based on iteratively reweighted
least squares (IRLS). First, existing extensions construct a different set of
components at each iteration and thus cannot provide a convergent set of
components. Second, existing extensions are computationally intensive because
of repetitively constructing a full set of components. Third, although they
pursue the convergence of regression coefficients, the resultant regression
coefficients may still diverge especially when building logistic regression
models. GOCRE instead sequentially builds up each orthogonal component upon
convergent construction, and simultaneously regresses against these orthogonal
components to fit the GLM. The performance of the new method is demonstrated by
both simulation studies and a real data example.

sign problems that seem unsolvable by traditional methods. The new solutions
emerge when partition functions are written in terms of fermion bags and
bosonic worldlines. In these new variables it is possible to identify hidden
pairing mechanisms which lead to the solutions. The new solutions allow us for
the first time to use Monte Carlo methods to solve a variety of interesting
lattice field theories, thus creating new opportunities for understanding
strongly correlated fermion systems.

completely damped at 100 fs. Characteristic time constants of incoherent energy
transfer, subsequently, vary from 1 ps to several tens of ps. We assign the
time scales of the EET to specific physical processes by comparing our results

12m-diameter atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes that has been fully operational
since September 2007. VERITAS has detected many as- trophysical sources of VHE
gamma rays, including at least 17 VHE sources that are likely Galactic in
origin. This paper describes some of the Galactic source highlights from
VERITAS with an emphasis on those aspects that relate to the origin of cosmic
rays. Specifically, topics include the VERITAS discovery of VHE emission from
the Tycho and CTA 1 supernova remnants, the identification of HESS J0632+057 as
a new VHE binary, a substantially improved view of the gamma-ray emission in
the Cygnus OB1 region, and the recent remarkable discovery of VHE emission from
the Crab pulsar. In 2009, VERITAS was upgraded by relocation of one of the
telescopes, leading to a significant improvement in sensitivity. A program to
further improve the performance of VERITAS, involving the upgrade of the
telescope trigger systems and the telescope cameras, was completed in summer
2012. The upgrade will lead to an improved sensitivity and a lower energy
threshold for VERITAS, allowing it to perform deeper observations of known
Galactic and extragalactic sources and to detect fainter and more distant
sources.

an undirected graph G*, where the vertices in the graph index a collection of
random variables and the edges encode conditional independence relationships
among random variables. The undirected graphical model selection (UGMS) problem
is to estimate the graph G* given observations drawn from the undirected
graphical model. This paper proposes a framework for decomposing the UGMS
problem into multiple subproblems over clusters and subsets of the separators
in a junction tree. The junction tree is constructed using a graph that
contains a superset of the edges in G*. We highlight three main properties of
using junction trees for UGMS. First, different regularization parameters or
different UGMS algorithms can be used to learn different parts of the graph.
This is possible since the subproblems we identify can be solved independently
of each other. Second, under certain conditions, a junction tree based UGMS
algorithm can produce consistent results with fewer observations than the usual
requirements of existing algorithms. Third, both our theoretical and
experimental results show that the junction tree framework does a significantly
better job at finding the weakest edges in a graph than existing methods. This
property is a consequence of both the first and second properties. Finally, we
note that our framework is independent of the choice of the UGMS algorithm and
can be used as a wrapper around standard UGMS algorithms for more accurate
graph estimation.

certain velocity c1 is found to be related by a simple power law to the driving
frequency omega of the acoustic wave. We find the existence of a critical
frequency omega_H above which uncharged bubbles necessarily have to oscillate
at velocities below c1. We further find that this critical frequency crucially
depends upon the amplitude Ps of the driving acoustic pressure wave. The

This problem was first studied by Green [Gre05] who proved a lower bound on
$\delta$ using an arithmetic regularity lemma. Regularity based lower bounds
for triangle removal in graphs were recently improved by Fox and we give a
direct proof of an analogous improvement for triangle removal in
$\mathbb{F}_2^n$.
  The improved lower bound was already known to follow (for triangle-removal in
all groups), using Fox's removal lemma for directed cycles and a reduction by
Kr\'{a}l, Serra and Vena [KSV09] (see [Fox11,CF13]). The purpose of this note
is to provide a direct Fourier-analytic proof for the group $\mathbb{F}_2^n.$

Yet to punish is costly, and the
costs often do not offset the gains that are due to elevated levels of
cooperation. However, the effectiveness of punishment depends not only on how
costly it is, but also on the circumstances defining the social dilemma. Using
the snowdrift game as the basis, we have conducted a series of economic
experiments to determine whether severe punishment is more effective than mild
punishment. We have observed that severe punishment is not necessarily more
effective, even if the cost of punishment is identical in both cases. The
benefits of severe punishment become evident only under extremely adverse
conditions, when to cooperate is highly improbable in the absence of sanctions.
If cooperation is likely, mild punishment is not less effective and leads to
higher average payoffs, and is thus the much preferred alternative. Presented
results suggest that the positive effects of punishment stem not only from
imposed fines, but may also have a psychological background. Small fines can do
wonders in motivating us to chose cooperation over defection, but without the
paralyzing effect that may be brought about by large fines. The later should be
utilized only when absolutely necessary.

three-dimensional shapes of galactic gravitational potentials since two
rotation curves can be measured in two perpendicular planes. Observational
studies have uncovered systematically larger rotation velocities in the
extended polar rings than in the associated host galaxies. In the dark matter
context, this can only be explained through dark halos that are systematically
flattened along the polar rings. Here, we point out that these objects can also
be used as very effective tests of gravity theories, such as those based on
Milgromian dynamics (MOND). We run a set of polar ring models using both
Milgromian and Newtonian dynamics to predict the expected shapes of the
rotation curves in both planes, varying the total mass of the system, the mass
of the ring with respect to the host, as well as the size of the hole at the
center of the ring. We find that Milgromian dynamics not only naturally leads
to rotation velocities being typically higher in the extended polar rings than
in the hosts, as would be the case in Newtonian dynamics without dark matter,
but that it also gets the shape and amplitude of velocities correct. Milgromian
dynamics thus adequately explains this particular property of polar ring
galaxies.

3D MHD model (with an imposed 10 mT vertical magnetic field), 1D models from
the PHOENIX project, the 1D MARCS model, and the 1D semi-empirical model of
Holweger & M\""uller. We confront the models with observational diagnostics of
the temperature profile: continuum centre-to-limb variations (CLV), absolute
continuum fluxes, and the wings of hydrogen lines. We also test the 3D models
for the intensity distribution of the granulation and spectral line shapes. The
predictions from the 3D model are in excellent agreement with the continuum CLV
observations, performing even better than the Holweger & M\""uller model
(constructed largely to fulfil such observations). The predictions of the 1D
theoretical models are worse, given their steeper temperature gradients. For
the continuum fluxes, predictions for most models agree well with the
observations. No model fits all hydrogen lines perfectly, but again the 3D
model comes ahead. The 3D model also reproduces the observed continuum
intensity fluctuations and spectral line shapes very well. The excellent
agreement of the 3D model with the observables reinforces the view that its
temperature structure is realistic. It outperforms the MHD simulation in all
diagnostics, implying that recent claims for revised abundances based on MHD
modelling are premature. Several weaknesses in the 1D models are exposed. The
differences between the PHOENIX LTE and NLTE models are small. We conclude that
the 3D hydrodynamical model is superior to any of the tested 1D models, which
gives further confidence in the solar abundance analyses based on it.

unassociated blended sources is ~1. Our predictions for the contributions of
spatially unassociated components and the distribution of redshift separations

The cavity provides a natural dissipation channel, which gives rise to

orders of magnitude while approaching the phase transition and observe a
behavior which significantly deviates from that expected for a closed system. A

has a strong dependence on the star formation rate, to the extent that a three
dimensional `fundamental metallicity relation' exists which links the three
parameters with minimal scatter. In this work, we use a sample of 4253 local
galaxies observed in atomic hydrogen from the ALFALFA survey to demonstrate,
for the first time, that a similar fundamental relation (the HI-FMR) also
exists between stellar mass, gas-phase metallicity, and HI mass. This latter
relation is likely more fundamental, driving the relation between metallicity,
SFR and mass. At intermediate masses, the behaviour of the gas fundamental
metallicity relation is very similar to that expressed via the star formation
rate. However, we find that the dependence of metallicity on HI content
persists to the highest stellar masses, in contrast to the `saturation' of
metallicity with SFR. It is interesting to note that the dispersion of the
relation is very low at intermediate stellar masses (9< log(M*/Msun) <11),
suggesting that in this range galaxies evolve smoothy, in an equilibrium
between gas inflow, outflow and star formation. At high and low stellar masses,
the scatter of the relation is significantly higher, suggesting that merging
events and/or stochastic accretion and star formation may drive galaxies
outside the relation. We also assemble a sample of galaxies observed in CO.
However, due to a small sample size, strong selection bias, and the influence
of a metallicity-dependent CO/H2 conversion factor, the data are insufficient
to test any influence of molecular gas on metallicity.

high precision Kepler photometry, and follow-up observations, our confidence
that these signals represent planetary transits is >99.1%. The inner planet,
Kepler-69b, has a radius of 2.24+/-0.4 Rearth and orbits the host star every
13.7 days. The outer planet, Kepler-69c, is a super-Earth-size object with a
radius of 1.7+/-0.3 Rearth and an orbital period of 242.5 days. Assuming an
Earth-like Bond albedo, Kepler-69c has an equilibrium temperature of 299 +/- 19
K, which places the planet close to the habitable zone around the host star.
This is the smallest planet found by Kepler to be orbiting in or near habitable

the reactions that occur during the pre explosive convective burning. To date,
determining the makeup of the white dwarf progenitor has relied on indirect
proxies, such as the average metallicity of the host stellar population. In
this paper, we present analytical calculations supporting the idea that the
electron fraction of the progenitor systematically influences the
nucleosynthesis of silicon group ejecta in Type Ia supernovae. In particular,
we suggest the abundances generated in quasi nuclear statistical equilibrium
are preserved during the subsequent freezeout. This allows one to potential
recovery of Ye at explosion from the abundances recovered from an observed
spectra. We show that measurement of 28Si, 32S, 40Ca, and 54Fe abundances can
be used to construct Ye in the silicon rich regions of the supernovae. If these
four abundances are determined exactly, they are sufficient to recover Ye to 6
percent. This is because these isotopes dominate the composition of
silicon-rich material and iron rich material in quasi nuclear statistical
equilibrium. Analytical analysis shows that the 28Si abundance is insensitive
to Ye, the 32S abundance has a nearly linear trend with Ye, and the 40Ca
abundance has a nearly quadratic trend with Ye. We verify these trends with
post-processing of 1D models and show that these trends are reflected in model
synthetic spectra.

cosmological information. It is therefore crucial to reliably predict their

provides a manifestly convergent perturbation theory for the weakly non-linear
regime, where dark matter correlation functions are computed in an expansion of
the wavenumber k over the wavenumber associated to the non-linear scale knl. To
push the predictions to higher wavenumbers, it is necessary to compute the
2-loop matter power spectrum. For equal-time correlators, exactly as with
standard perturturbation theory, there are IR divergences present in each
diagram that cancel completely in the final result. We develop a method by
which all 2-loop diagrams are computed as one integral, with an integrand that
is manifestly free of any IR divergences. This allows us to compute the 2-loop
power spectra in a reliable way that is much less numerically challenging than
standard techniques. We apply our method to scaling universes where the linear
power spectrum is a single power law of k, and where IR divergences can
particularly easily interfere with accurate evaluation of loop corrections if
not handled carefully. We show that our results are independent of IR cutoff
and, after renormalization, of the UV cutoff, and comment how the method
presented here naturally generalizes to higher loops.

only a few Gravitational radii above the accretion disk. The inclusion of a
large number of possible systematics uncertainties does not significantly

optimization, economics, machine learning, etc. and exhibit a rich
combinatorial structure. Many subclasses of submodular functions have also been
well studied and these subclasses widely vary in their complexity. Our
motivation is to understand the relative complexity of these classes of
functions. Towards this, we consider the question of how well can one class of
submodular functions be approximated by another (simpler) class of submodular
functions. Such approximations naturally allow algorithms designed for the
simpler class to be applied to the bigger class of functions. We prove both
upper and lower bounds on such approximations.
  Our main results are:
  1. General submodular functions can be approximated by cut functions of
directed graphs to a factor of $n^2/4$, which is tight.
  2. General symmetric submodular functions$^{1}$ can be approximated by cut
functions of undirected graphs to a factor of $n-1$, which is tight up to a
constant.
  3. Budgeted additive functions can be approximated by coverage functions to a
factor of $e/(e-1)$, which is tight.
  Here $n$ is the size of the ground set on which the submodular function is
defined.
  We also observe that prior works imply that monotone submodular functions can
be approximated by coverage functions with a factor between $O(\sqrt{n} \log
n)$ and $\Omega(n^{1/3} /\log^2 n) $.

theory mapped to the anti-selfdual variables in any gauge is identical to the
one of the original theory. This is due to the conspiracy between the Jacobian
of the change to the anti-selfdual variables and an extra functional
determinant that arises from the non-linearity of the coupling of the
anti-selfdual curvature to an external source in the Legendre transform that
defines the 1PI effective action. Hence we establish the one-loop perturbative

about the physical state of star forming regions. In order to investigate the
line profiles from dynamical collapsing massive star forming regions (MSFRs),
we model the emission from hydrodynamic simulations of a collapsing cloud in
the absence of outflows. By performing radiative transfer calculations, we
compute the optically thick HCO+ and optically thin N2H+ line profiles from two
collapsing regions at different epochs. Due to large-scale collapse, the MSFRs
have large velocity gradients, reaching up to 20 km/s/pc across the central
core. The optically thin lines typically contain multiple velocity components
resulting from the superposition of numerous density peaks along the
line-of-sight. The optically thick lines are only marginally shifted to the
blue side of the optically thin line profiles, and frequently do not have a
central depression in their profiles due to self-absorption. As the regions
evolve the lines become brighter and the optically thick lines become broader.
The lower order HCO+ (1-0) transitions are better indicators of collapse than
the higher order (4-3) transitions. We also investigate how the beam sizes
affect profile shapes. Smaller beams lead to brighter and narrower lines that
are more skewed to the blue in HCO+ relative to the true core velocity, but
show multiple components in N2H+. High resolution observations (e.g. with ALMA)
can test these predictions and provide insights into the nature of MSFRs.

Photometrically, the objects of our sample show a diverse late-time behaviour,
some of them fading quite rapidly after a light-curve break at ~150-200d. The
latter is likely the result of flux redistribution into the infrared, possibly
caused by dust formation, rather than a true bolometric effect. Nebular spectra
of superluminous SNe Ia are characterised by weak or absent [Fe III] emission,
pointing at a low ejecta ionisation state as a result of high densities. To
constrain the ejecta and 56Ni masses of superluminous SNe Ia, we compare the
observed bolometric light curve of SN 2009dc with synthetic model light curves,
focusing on the radioactive tail after ~60d. Models with enough 56Ni to explain
the light-curve peak by radioactive decay, and at the same time sufficient mass
to keep the ejecta velocities low, fail to reproduce the observed light-curve
tail of SN 2009dc because of too much gamma-ray trapping. We instead propose a
model with ~1 solar mass of 56Ni and ~2 solar masses of ejecta, which may be
interpreted as the explosion of a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf (WD)
enshrouded by 0.6-0.7 solar masses of C/O-rich material, as it could result
from a merger of two massive C/O WDs. This model reproduces the late light
curve of SN 2009dc well. A flux deficit at peak may be compensated by light
from the interaction of the ejecta with the surrounding material.

in ""tidal tails"", creating a circumstellar medium around the system. We
consider the variety of observational signatures from this material, which
depend on the lag time between the start of the merger and the ultimate
explosion (assuming one occurs) of the system in a Type Ia supernova. If the
time lag is fairly short, the interaction of the supernova ejecta with the
tails could lead to detectable shock emission at radio, optical, and/or x-ray
wavelengths. At somewhat later times, the tails produce relatively broad NaID
absorption lines with velocity widths of order the white dwarf escape speed
($\sim 1000$ \kms). That none of these signatures have been detected in normal
SNe Ia constrains the lag time to be either very short ($\lesssim 100$ s) or
fairly long ($\gtrsim 100$ yr). If the tails have expanded and cooled over
timescales $\sim 10^4$ yr, they could be observable through narrow NaID and
CaII H&K absorption lines in the spectra, which are seen in some fraction of
SNe Ia. Using a combination of 3D and 1D hydrodynamical codes, we model the
mass-loss from tidal interactions in binary systems, and the subsequent
interactions with the interstellar medium, which produce a slow-moving, dense
shell of gas. We synthesize NaID line profiles by ray-casting through this
shell, and show that in some circumstances tidal tails could be responsible for
narrow absorptions similar to those observed.

4.7 micron from 69 protoplanetary disks, obtained with CRIRES on the ESO Very
Large Telescope at the highest available spectral resolving power (R=95,000,
v=3.2 km/s). The CO fundamental band (Delta v=1) is a well-known tracer of warm
gas in the inner, planet-forming regions of gas-rich disks around young stars,
with the lines formed in the super-heated surfaces of the disks at radii of
0.1-10 AU. Our high spectral resolution data provide new insight into the
kinematics of the inner disk gas. Pure double-peaked Keplerian profiles are
surprisingly uncommon, beyond the frequency expected based on disk inclination.
The majority of the profiles are consistent with emission from a disk plus a
slow (few km/s) molecular disk wind. This is evidenced by analysis of different
categories as well as an overall tendency for line profiles to have excess blue
emission. Weak emission lines from isotopologues and vibrationally excited
levels are readily detected. In general, 13CO lines trace cooler gas than the
bulk 12CO emission and may arise from further out in the disk, as indicated by
narrower line profiles. A high fraction of the sources show vibrationally
excited emission (~50%) which is correlated with accretion luminosity,
consistent with ultra-violet (UV) fluorescent excitation. Disks around
early-type Herbig AeBe stars have narrower lines, on average, than their
lower-mass late-type counterparts, due to their increased luminosity.
Evolutionary changes in CO are also seen. Removal of the protostellar envelope
between class I and II results in the disappearance of the strong absorption
lines and CO ice feature characteristic of class I spectra. However, CO
emission from class I and II objects is similar in detection frequency,
excitation and line shape, indicating that inner disk characteristics are
established early.

of a non-solar enhancement of alpha-elements by +0.3 dex. Moreover, our grid of
synthetic spectral energy distributions (SEDs) is interpolated to a finer
numerical resolution in both T_eff (Delta T_eff = 25 K) and log g (Delta log g
= 0.25). We compare the values of T_eff and log g inferred from fitting LTE and
Non-LTE SEDs to observed SEDs throughout the entire visible band, and in an ad
hoc ""blue"" band. We compare our spectrophotometrically derived T_eff values to
a variety of T_eff calibrations, including more empirical ones, drawn from the
literature. For stars of solar metallicity, we find that the adoption of the
GASS10 abundances lowers the inferred T_eff value by 25 - 50 K for late-type
giants, and NLTE models computed with the GASS10 abundances give T_eff results
that are marginally in better agreement with other T_eff calibrations. For
stars of [M/H]=-0.5 there is marginal evidence that adoption of
alpha-enhancement further lowers the derived T_eff value by 50 K. Stellar
parameters inferred from fitting NLTE models to SEDs are more dependent than
LTE models on the wavelength region being fitted, and we find that the effect
depends on how heavily line blanketed the fitting region is, whether the
fitting region is to the blue of the Wien peak of the star's SED, or both.

continuum force balance equations provide the constraints. Splitting of the
atomistic and continuum problems instead of blending them and their subsequent
use as constraints in the optimization problem distinguishes our approach from
the existing AtC formulations. We present and analyze the method in the context

dwarf formation has been revisited and recast into what is often referred to as
the ""tidal downsizing"" hypothesis. The fragmentation of self-gravitating
protostellar discs into gravitationally bound embryos - with masses of a few to
tens of Jupiter masses, at semi major axes above 30 - 40 au - is followed by
grain sedimentation inside the embryo, radial migration towards the central
star and tidal disruption of the embryo's upper layers. The properties of the
resultant object depends sensitively on the timescales upon which each process
occurs. Therefore, GI followed by tidal downsizing can theoretically produce
objects spanning a large mass range, from terrestrial planets to giant planets
and brown dwarfs. Whether such objects can be formed in practice, and what
proportions of the observed population they would represent, requires a more
involved statistical analysis.
  We present a simple population synthesis model of star and planet formation
via GI and tidal downsizing. We couple a semi-analytic model of protostellar
disc evolution to analytic calculations of fragmentation, initial embryo mass,
grain growth and sedimentation, embryo migration and tidal disruption. While
there are key pieces of physics yet to be incorporated, it represents a first
step towards a mature statistical model of GI and tidal downsizing as a mode of
star and planet formation.
  We show results from four runs of the population synthesis model, varying the
opacity law and the strength of migration, as well as investigating the effect
of disc truncation during the fragmentation process. Our early results suggest
that GI plus tidal downsizing is not the principal mode of planet formation,
but remains an excellent means of forming gas giant planets, brown dwarfs and
low mass stars at large semimajor axes. (Abridged)

state are intermediate phases induced by thermal fluctuations in the phase
competing regime; they are present only at finite temperatures and eventually
taken over by another phases as the temperature is further lowered. Although
the Kosterlitz-Thouless like state was found also in triangular Ising
antiferromagnets with further-neighbor interactions, the partially disordered
state has not been reported in the localized spin only models in two

the charge degree of freedom of itinerant electrons; it is insulating and
accompanied by charge disproportionation. From a combined analysis of a
mean-field calculation of the band structure and Monte Carlo simulation, we
conclude that the partial disorder in the present model is stabilized by the
Slater mechanism.

of the brighter predictions of the expected 21cm EoR signal level. Using the
upper limits set by these measurements, we generate new constraints on the
brightness temperature of 21cm emission in neutral regions for various
reionization models. We show that for several ionization scenarios, our
measurements are inconsistent with cold reionization. That is, heating of the
neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) is necessary to remain consistent with the
constraints we report. Hence, we have suggestive evidence that by $z=7.7$, the
HI has been warmed from its cold primordial state, probably by X-rays from
high-mass X-ray binaries or mini-quasars. The strength of this evidence depends
on the ionization state of the IGM, which we are not yet able to constrain.

results are in a reasonable agreement with the observed data. It is also found
that the optical PSF can be well corrected by the standard correction method
with a polynomial fitting function. However, for the atmospheric PSF, its
correction is affected by the common limitation caused by sparse sampling of
PSFs due to a limited number of stars. We also examined the effects of the
residual PSF anisotropies on Suprime-Cam cosmic shear data. We found that the
shape and amplitude of the B-mode shear variance are broadly consistent with
those of the residual PSF ellipticities measured from the dense star field

Small Array. With these observations we determine the level of the low
frequency (~1 - 5 GHz) emission. We do not detect any significant extended
emission in these regions and we compute conservative 3\sigma upper limits on
the fraction of free-free emission at 33 GHz of 27%, 12%, and 18% for the three
strips, indicating that the level of the emission at 1.4 and 5 GHz cannot
account for the emission observed at 33 GHz. Additionally, we find that the low
frequency emission is not spatially correlated with the emission observed at 33
GHz. These results indicate that the emission observed in the Perseus molecular
cloud at 33 GHz, is indeed in excess over the low frequency emission, hence
confirming its anomalous nature.

transition involves a slight elongation of the CoO6 octahedra along the apical
axis. Below T_N, the application of a large magnetic field causes a
reorientation of the Co^2+ Ising spins. This metamagnetic transition is
first-order as evidenced by a latent heat observed in temperature-dependent
measurements. This transition is initially seen at T = 180 K as a broad upturn
in the M-H near H_C = 3.9 T. The upturn sharpens into a kink at T = 120 K and a
""butterfly"" shape emerges, with the transition causing hysteresis at high
fields while linear and reversible behavior persists at low fields. H_C
decreases as temperature is lowered and the loops at positive and negative
fields merge beneath T = 20 K. The antiferromagnetism is described by k_M = (00
1/2) and below T = 20 K a small uncompensated component with k_M = (000)

toward saturation at M_S = 1.0 uB/Co. We conclude that the field-induced state

equations with large, highly oscillatory, random potential. When the
correlation function of the random potential satisfies a specific integrability
condition, we show that the random solution converges, as the correlation
length of the medium tends to zero, to the deterministic solution of a
homogenized equation in dimension $d\geq3$. Our derivation is based on a
Feynman-Kac probabilistic representation and the Kipnis-Varadhan method applied
to weak convergence of Brownian motions in random sceneries. For sufficiently
mixing coefficients, we also provide an optimal rate of convergence to the
homogenized limit using a quantitative martingale central limit theorem. As
soon as the above integrability condition fails, the solution is expected to
remain stochastic in the limit of a vanishing correlation length. For a large
class of potentials given as functionals of Gaussian fields, we show the
convergence of solutions to stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE)
with multiplicative noise. The Feynman-Kac representation and the corresponding
weak convergence of Brownian motions in random sceneries allows us to explain
the transition from deterministic to stochastic limits as a function of the
correlation function of the random potential.

possibility of building OTM's using quantum mechanical devices. It is known
that OTM's cannot exist in a fully-quantum world or in a fully-classical world.
Instead, we propose a new model based on ""isolated qubits"" -- qubits that can
only be accessed using local operations and classical communication (LOCC).
This model combines a quantum resource (single-qubit measurements) with a
classical restriction (on communication between qubits), and can be implemented
using current technologies, such as nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond. In
this model, we construct OTM's that are information-theoretically secure
against one-pass LOCC adversaries that use 2-outcome measurements.
  Our construction resembles Wiesner's old idea of quantum conjugate coding,
implemented using random error-correcting codes; our proof of security uses
entropy chaining to bound the supremum of a suitable empirical process. In
addition, we conjecture that our random codes can be replaced by some class of
efficiently-decodable codes, to get computationally-efficient OTM's that are
secure against computationally-bounded LOCC adversaries.
  In addition, we construct data-hiding states, which allow an LOCC sender to
encode an (n-O(1))-bit messsage into n qubits, such that at most half of the
message can be extracted by a one-pass LOCC receiver, but the whole message can
be extracted by a general quantum receiver.

a diversity of experimental data sets and between many different regions of the
brain. Several computational mechanisms have been proposed to account for such
isochronous synchronization in the presence of long conduction delays: Of
these, the phenomenon of ""dynamical relaying"" - a mechanism that relies on a
specific network motif - has proven to be the most robust with respect to
parameter mismatch and system noise. Surprisingly, despite a contrary belief in
the community, the common driving motif is an unreliable means of establishing
zero-lag synchrony. Although dynamical relaying has been validated in empirical
and computational studies, the deeper dynamical mechanisms and comparison to
dynamics on other motifs is lacking. By systematically comparing
synchronization on a variety of small motifs, we establish that the presence of
a single reciprocally connected pair - a ""resonance pair"" - plays a crucial
role in disambiguating those motifs that foster zero-lag synchrony in the
presence of conduction delays (such as dynamical relaying) from those that do
not (such as the common driving triad). Remarkably, minor structural changes to
the common driving motif that incorporate a reciprocal pair recover robust
zero-lag synchrony. The findings are observed in computational models of
spiking neurons, populations of spiking neurons and neural mass models, and
arise whether the oscillatory systems are periodic, chaotic, noise-free or
driven by stochastic inputs. The influence of the resonance pair is also robust
to parameter mismatch and asymmetrical time delays amongst the elements of the
motif. We call this manner of facilitating zero-lag synchrony resonance-induced
synchronization, outline the conditions for its occurrence, and propose that it
may be a general mechanism to promote zero-lag synchrony in the brain.

the Z^2 square lattice to SLE(2), in the supremum norm topology that takes the
time parametrization of the curves into account. The discrete curves are
parametrized so that the walker moves at a constant speed determined by the
lattice spacing, and the SLE(2) curve has the recently introduced natural time
parametrization. Our strategy can be seen as an extension of the one used by
Lawler, Schramm, and Werner to prove convergence modulo time parametrization.
The crucial extra step is showing that the expected occupation measure of the
discrete curve, properly renormalized by the chosen time parametrization,
converges to the occupation density of the SLE(2) curve, the so-called SLE
Green's function. Although we do not prove this convergence, we rigorously
establish some partial results in this direction including a new loop-erased
random walk estimate.

planetesimals, which can explain its small mass and rapid formation timescale
obtained from 182Hf-182$W chronometry. In the classical theory of planet
formation, the final embryo mass is determined only by the solid surface
density. However, embryos can stir surrounding planetesimals, leading to
fragmentation through erosive (cratering) collisions. We find that radial drift
of small fragments can drastically reduce the solid surface density. On the
other hand, embryo growth is accelerated by fragment accretion. Since
collisional fragmentation efficiency depends on the initial size of
planetesimals, the final embryo mass and its growth time are determined by the
initial planetesimal size and disk surface density. We have investigated the
effect of these two parameters on the mass of Mars and the predicted radiogenic
excess of 182W in the martian mantle. Two scenarios can explain the rapid
formation of small Mars: (i) it formed by accretion of small planetesimals in a
massive disk or (ii) it formed from large planetesimals but its growth was
arrested by the inward then outward migration of Jupiter. Taking into account
all constraints, we conclude that Mars is likely to have formed in a massive
disk of about ~ 0.1 solar mass from planetesimals smaller than ~ 10 km in
radius. Such small planetesimal size cannot explain core accretion of Jupiter,
suggesting that there may have been a heliocentric gradient in planetesimal
size in the solar nebula.

general model assuming orthogonal user channels with the peak bit-rates close
to the theoretical Shannon's bound in the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)
channel, which leads to the resource constraints in a multi-rate linear form.
In this setting we consider a natural class of least-effort-served-first
resource allocation policies, for which the characteristics of the model can be
further evaluated using Fourier analysis of Poisson variables. Within this
class we identify and evaluate an optimal and a fair policy, the latter being
suggested by LTE implementations. We also propose some intermediate policies,
which allow to solve the optimality/fairness tradeoff caused by unequal user
radio-channel conditions. Our results can be used for the evaluation of the
quality of RTS in LTE networks and dimensioning of these networks.

including sink particles to model star formation. We find that the simulations
predict close to exponential DGMFs over the column density range N(H2) = 3-25 x
10^{21} cm^{-2} that can be easily probed via, e.g., dust extinction
measurements. The exponential slopes correlate with the type of turbulence
driving and also with the star formation efficiency. They are almost
uncorrelated with the sonic Mach number and magnetic-field strength. The slopes
at early stages of cloud evolution are steeper than at the later stages. A
comparison of these predictions with observations shows that only simulations
with relatively non-compressive driving (b ~< 0.4) agree with the DGMFs of
nearby molecular clouds. Massive infrared dark clouds can show DGMFs that are
in agreement with more compressive driving. The DGMFs of molecular clouds can
be significantly affected by how compressive the turbulence is on average.
Variations in the level of compression can cause scatter to the DGMF slopes,
and some variation is indeed necessary to explain the spread of the observed
DGMF slopes. The observed DGMF slopes can also be affected by the clouds' star
formation activities and statistical cloud-to-cloud variations.

fins. While much effort has been devoted to understanding the flapping
kinematics and its influence on the swimming efficiency, little is known about
the stability (or lack of) of periodic swimming. It is believed that stability
limits maneuverability and body designs/flapping motions that are adapted for
stable swimming are not suitable for high maneuverability and vice versa. In
this paper, we consider a simplified model of a planar elliptic body undergoing
prescribed periodic heaving and pitching in potential flow. We show that
periodic locomotion can be achieved due to the resulting hydrodynamic forces,
and its value depends on several parameters including the aspect ratio of the
body, the amplitudes and phases of the prescribed flapping. We obtain
closed-form solutions for the locomotion and efficiency for small flapping
amplitudes, and numerical results for finite flapping amplitudes. We then study
the stability of the (finite amplitude flapping) periodic locomotion using
Floquet theory. We find that stability depends nonlinearly on all parameters.
Interesting trends of switching between stable and unstable motions emerge and
evolve as we continuously vary the parameter values. This suggests that, for
live organisms that control their flapping motion, maneuverability and
stability need not be thought of as disjoint properties, rather the organism
may manipulate its motion in favor of one or the other depending on the task at
hand.

Problem (CSP) is to identify tractable classes of constraints and develop

(GS) constraints which is an important generalization of one such tractable
class found in the literature, namely, staircase constraints. GS constraints
are of two kinds, down staircase (DS) and up staircase (US). We first examine
several properties of GS constraints, and then show that arc consistency is

propose an optimal O(cd) time and space algorithm to compute arc consistency

the largest domain. Next, observing that arc consistency is not necessary for
solving a DSCSP, we propose a more efficient algorithm for solving it. With
regard to US constraints, arc consistency is not known to be sufficient to
determine a solution, and therefore, methods such as path consistency or

frames into the data consistency term. The method is not required to be affine
or rigid and does not need additional measurements. Moreover, it handles
multi-channel MRI data by simultaneously determining the image and its coil
sensitivity profiles in a nonlinear formulation which also adapts to
non-Cartesian (e.g., radial) sampling schemes. Experimental results of a motion
phantom with controlled speed and in vivo measurements of rapid tongue
movements demonstrate image improvements in preserving temporal fidelity and
removing residual artifacts.

transactions on counterparty exposures in a market with OTC transactions across
several asset classes with heterogeneous characteristics. The impact of
introducing a central counterparty (CCP) on expected interdealer exposure is
determined by the tradeoff between multilateral netting across dealers on one
hand and bilateral netting across asset classes on the other hand. We find this
tradeoff to be sensitive to assumptions on heterogeneity of asset classes in
terms of `riskyness' of the asset class as well as correlation of exposures
across asset classes. In particular, while an analysis assuming independent,
homogeneous exposures suggests that central clearing is efficient only if one
has an unrealistically high number of participants, the opposite conclusion is
reached if differences in riskyness and correlation across asset classes are
realistically taken into account. We argue that empirically plausible
specifications of model parameters lead to the conclusion that central clearing
does reduce interdealer exposures: the gain from multilateral netting in a CCP
overweighs the loss of netting across asset classes in bilateral netting
agreements. When a CCP exists for interest rate derivatives, adding a CCP for
credit derivatives is shown to decrease overall exposures. These findings are
shown to be robust to the statistical assumptions of the model as well as the
choice of risk measure used to quantify exposures.

both p- and g-modes can be excited by the $\kappa$-mechanism acting in the

intermediate convective zone (ICZ) related to the hydrogen burning shell is not
necessary for excitation of g-modes. These modes can be reflected at a minimum
of the Brunt-V\""ais\""al\""a frequency, located at the top of the chemical
composition gradient region surrounding the radiative helium core. This minimum
is associated with the change of actual temperature gradient from the adiabatic
value in the semiconvective zone to the radiative value above it. Thus, the
existence of pulsations at this evolutionary stage does not prove the existence
of the convective zone but only some reflective layer. Finally, we show that no
regular patterns can be expected in oscillation spectra of blue supergiant
pulsators but there is a prospect for identification of the mode degree,
$\ell$, from multicolour photometry.

The simulations were carried out at several temperatures and each run lasted

melting process starts at the surface and propagates to the bulk of the ice
block. Already at the temperatures below the melting point, we observe a thin

identify the complete zero-temperature phase diagram of the disordered BHM in
$d\ge2$ dimensions by analyzing the geometric properties of what we call
superfluid (SF) clusters, which are defined to be clusters of sites with
non-integer expectation values for the local boson occupation number. The Mott
insulator (MI) phase then is the region in the phase diagram where no SF
clusters exist, and the SF phase the region, where SF clusters percolate - the
BG phase is in between: SF clusters exist, but do not percolate. This
definition is particularly useful in the context of local mean field (LMF, or
Gutzwiller-Ansatz) calculations, where we show that an identification of the
phases on the basis of global quantities like the averaged SF order parameter
and the compressibility are misleading. We apply the SF cluster analysis to the
LMF ground states of the two dimensional disordered BHM to produce its phase
diagram and find a) an excellent agreement with the phase diagram predicted on
the basis of quantum Monte Carlo simulations for the commensurate density
$n=1$, and b) large differences to stochastic mean field and other mean field
predictions for fixed disorder strength. The relation of the percolation
transition of the SF clusters with the onset of non-vanishing SF stiffness

Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) are of particular interest because of their

as a means to lower the cost of future space endeavours. In this paper, we
consider the currently known NEO population and define a family of so-called

accessible heliocentric orbits into the Earth's neighbourhood at affordable
costs. The asteroid retrieval transfers are sought from the continuum of low
energy transfers enabled by the dynamics of invariant manifolds; specifically,
the retrieval transfers target planar, vertical Lyapunov and halo orbit
families associated with the collinear equilibrium points of the Sun-Earth
Circular Restricted Three Body problem. The judicious use of these dynamical
features provides the best opportunity to find extremely low energy Earth
transfers for asteroid material. A catalogue of asteroid retrieval candidates
is then presented. Despite the highly incomplete census of very small
asteroids, the ERO catalogue can already be populated with 12 different objects
retrievable with less than 500 m/s of {\Delta}v. Moreover, the approach
proposed represents a robust search and ranking methodology for future

perturbations needed to explain the observed large scale structures in the
universe. Inflation traces back all the inhomogeneities to quantum fluctuations
although the structures look classical today. Squeezing of primordial quantum
fluctuations along with the mechanism of decoherence accounts for many aspects
of this quantum to classical transition, although it remains a matter of debate
as to whether this is sufficient to explain the issue of realization of a
single outcome (i.e. the issue of macro-objectification) from a quantum
ensemble given that the universe is a closed system. A similar question of
emergence of classical behavior of macroscopic objects exists also for
laboratory systems and apart from decoherence there have been attempts to
resolve this issue through Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL), which is
a stochastic nonlinear modification of the non-relativistic Schr\""{o}dinger
equation. Recently, Martin {\it et al.} have investigated whether a CSL-like
mechanism with a constant strength parameter, when the Mukhanov-Sasaki variable
is taken as the ""collapse-operator"", can explain how the primordial quantum
perturbations generated during inflation become classical. Within the scope of
their assumptions they essentially come to a negative conclusion. In the
present work, we generalize their analysis by allowing the CSL strength
parameter to depend on physical scales so as to capture the CSL amplification
mechanism. We show that such a generalization provides a mechanism for
macro-objectification (i.e. classicalization) of the inflationary quantum
perturbations, while also preserving scale invariance of the power spectrum and
phase coherence of super-horizon perturbation modes in a particular class of
these models.

attention in recent times. This growing capability, facilitated by modern
communication technology, is highly relevant to endeavors which require the
search for individuals that posses rare information or skill, such as finding
medical doctors during disasters, or searching for missing people. An open
question remains, as to whether in time-critical situations, people are able to
recruit in a targeted manner, or whether they resort to so-called blind search,
recruiting as many acquaintances as possible via broadcast communication. To
explore this question, we examine data from our recent success in the U.S.
State Department's Tag Challenge, which required locating and photographing 5
target persons in 5 different cities in the United States and Europe in less
than 12 hours, based only on a single mug-shot. We find that people are able to
consistently route information in a targeted fashion even under increasing time
pressure. We derive an analytical model for global mobilization and use it to

To reduce search lengths, we propose a mechanism based on building random walks
connecting together partial walks (PW) previously computed at each network
node. Resources found in each PW are registered. Searches can then jump over
PWs where the resource is not located. However, we assume that perfect
recording of resources may be costly, and hence, probabilistic structures like
Bloom filters are used. Then, unnecessary hops may come from false positives at
the Bloom filters. Two variations of this mechanism have been considered,
depending on whether we first choose a PW in the current node and then check it
for the resource, or we first check all PWs and then choose one. In addition,
PWs can be either simple random walks or self-avoiding random walks. Analytical
models are provided to predict expected search lengths and other magnitudes of
the resulting four mechanisms. Simulation experiments validate these
predictions and allow us to compare these techniques with simple random walk
searches, finding very large reductions of expected search lengths.

journals from a general bibliometric perspective. In this context, the Thomson
Reuters journal impact factors (JIF) are the citation-based indicators most
used. The 2-year journal impact factor (2-JIF) counts citations to one and two
year old articles, while the 5-year journal impact factor (5-JIF) counts
citations from one to five year old articles. Nevertheless, these indicators
are not comparable among fields of science for two reasons: (i) each field has
a different impact maturity time, and (ii) because of systematic differences in
publication and citation behaviour across disciplines. In fact, the 5-JIF
firstly appeared in the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) in 2007 with the purpose
of making more comparable impacts in fields in which impact matures slowly.
However, there is not an optimal fixed impact maturity time valid for all the
fields. In some of them two years provides a good performance whereas in others
three or more years are necessary. Therefore, there is a problem when comparing
a journal from a field in which impact matures slowly with a journal from a
field in which impact matures rapidly. In this work, we propose the 2-year
maximum journal impact factor (2M-JIF), a new impact indicator that considers
the 2-year rolling citation time window of maximum impact instead of the
previous 2-year time window. Finally, an empirical application comparing 2-JIF,
5-JIF, and 2M-JIF shows that the maximum rolling target window reduces the
between-group variance with respect to the within-group variance in a random

framework for treating short-range correlations in many-body systems after it
was first proposed by Kikuchi in 1951. On the numerical side, a message-passing
approach called generalized belief propagation (GBP) was proposed by Yedidia,
Freeman and Weiss about a decade ago as a way of computing the minimal value of
the cluster variational free energy and the marginal distributions of clusters
of variables. However the GBP equations are often redundant, and it is quite a
non-trivial task to make the GBP iteration converges to a fixed point. These
drawbacks hinder the application of the GBP approach to finite-dimensional
frustrated and disordered systems.
  In this work we report an alternative and simple derivation of the GBP
equations starting from the partition function expression. Based on this
derivation we propose a natural and systematic way of removing the redundance
of the GBP equations. We apply the simplified generalized belief propagation
(SGBP) equations to the two-dimensional and the three-dimensional ferromagnetic
Ising model and Edwards-Anderson spin glass model. The numerical results
confirm that the SGBP message-passing approach is able to achieve satisfactory
performance on these model systems. We also suggest that a subset of the SGBP
equations can be neglected in the numerical iteration process without affecting
the final results.

empty Minkowski spacetime. We put forward a hypothesis that the physical
Universe includes a quantum environment that interacts with particle scattering
processes. While the scattering process is governed by the S-matrix the
interaction evolves the produced state rho_f(S) to observed state rho_f(O). To
be consistent with the Standard Model this new interaction must be a pure
dephasing interaction governed by a non-unitary evolution law modifying the
phases of the amplitudes. We present the first test of the unitary evolution
law in particle scattering. The unitary evolution law evolves pure initial
states into pure final states in exclusive processes. This fact leads to 9
independent constraints on 16 components of angular intensities in piN->pipiN
processes. When expressed in terms of P-parity conserving transversity
amplitudes all 9 constraints are identities provided a single constrain on the
transversity amplitudes holds true. The constraint implies that the relative
phases between transverity amplitudes of the same naturality and transversity
must be 0 or +/- pi. All previous amplitude analyses of the piN->pipiN
processes found non-unitary relative phases in an apparent violation of the
unitary evolution law. The contrast between the predicted and the observed
relative phases presents an unambigous evidence for the existence of the
quantum environment and its pure dephasing interaction with particle scattering
processes.

MW terminal velocities in the region inside the solar circle, circular velocity
as recently estimated from maser star forming regions at intermediate radii,
and velocity dispersions of stellar halo tracers for the outermost Galactic
region. The latter are reproduced by integrating the Jeans equation for every
modeled mass distribution, and by allowing for different velocity anisotropies
for different tracer populations. For comparison we also consider a
Navarro-Frenk-White profile. We find that the cored profile is the preferred
one, with a shallow central density of rho_H~4x10^7M_s/kpc^3 and a large core
radius R_H~10 kpc, as observed in external spirals and in agreement with the
mass model underlying the Universal Rotation Curve of spirals. We describe also
the derived model uncertainties, which are crucially driven by the poorly
constrained velocity dispersion anisotropies of halo tracers. The emerging
cored DM distribution has implications for the DM annihilation angular profile,
which is much less boosted in the Galactic center direction with respect to the
case of the standard \Lambda CDM, NFW profile. Using the derived uncertainties
we discuss finally the limitations and prospects to discriminate between cored

the FM matrix, we predict that V, Cr, and Co increase the ITS of Fe, while Al

comparison to FM Fe, the alloying effect of Al and Co to PM Fe is reversed and
the relative magnitude of the ITS can be altered more strongly for any of the

of the $(001)$ planes under uniaxial tensile loading in both magnetic phases.
We show that the previously established ITS model based on structural energy
differences proves successful in the PM Fe-alloys but is of limited use in the

quiescent starless, or perturbed starless, and derive some physical properties.
The average sizes and ammonia column densities are 0.06 pc and 10^15 cm^-2,
respectively, with no significant differences between the starless and
protostellar cores, while the linewidth and rotational temperature of quiescent
starless cores are smaller, 1.0 km/s and 16 K, than those of protostellar (1.8
km/s, 21 K), and perturbed starless (1.4 km/s, 19 K) cores. Such linewidths and
temperatures for these quiescent starless cores in the surroundings of massive
stars are still significantly larger than the typical values measured in
starless cores of low-mass star-forming regions, implying an important
non-thermal component. We confirm at high angular resolutions the correlations
previously found with single-dish telescopes between the linewidth, the
temperature of the cores, and the bolometric luminosity. In addition, we find a
correlation between the temperature of each core and the incident flux from the
most massive star in the cluster, suggesting that the large temperatures
measured in the starless cores of our sample could be due to heating from the
nearby massive star. A simple virial equilibrium analysis seems to suggest a
scenario of a self-similar, self-graviting, turbulent, virialised hierarchy of
structures from clumps (0.1-10 pc) to cores (0.05 pc). A closer inspection of
the dynamical state taking into account external pressure effects, reveal that
relatively strong magnetic field support may be needed to stabilise the cores,
or that they are unstable and thus on the verge of collapse.

comparison. Each such class, including common intervals, led to the development
of a specific algorithmic approach for K=2, and - except for nested common
intervals - for its extension to an arbitrary K.
  In this paper, we propose a common and efficient algorithmic framework for
finding different types of common intervals in a set P of K permutations, with
arbitrary K. Our generic algorithm is based on a global representation of the
information stored in P, called the MinMax-profile of P, and an efficient data
structure, called an LR-stack, that we introduce here. We show that common
intervals (and their subclasses of irreducible common intervals and same-sign
common intervals), nested common intervals (and their subclass of maximal
nested common intervals) as well as conserved intervals (and their subclass of
irreducible conserved intervals) may be obtained by appropriately setting the
parameters of our algorithm in each case. All the resulting algorithms run in
O(Kn+N)-time and need O(n) additional space, where N is the number of
solutions. The algorithms for nested common intervals and maximal nested common
intervals are new for K>2, in the sense that no other algorithm has been given
so far to solve the problem with the same complexity, or better. The other
algorithms are as efficient as the best known algorithms.

interaction between the two entities manifests itself via dispersive and
dissipative effects observed as frequency shifts and linewidth broadenings of
the photonic mode respectively. A Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian master equation
calculation is used to model the combined system response and allows for
determining both the coherence properties of the double quantum dot and its
interdot tunnel coupling with high accuracy. The value and uncertainty of the
tunnel coupling extracted from the microwave read-out technique are compared to
a standard quantum point contact charge detection analysis. The two techniques
are found to be consistent with a superior precision for the microwave
experiment when tunneling rates approach the resonator eigenfrequency.
Decoherence properties of the double dot are further investigated as a function
of the number of electrons inside the dots. They are found to be similar in the
single-electron and many-electron regimes suggesting that the density of the
confinement energy spectrum plays a minor role in the decoherence rate of the

SMC/LMC-template WR stars we empirically estimate a minimum of ~ 20 WR stars

properties. An error-weighted mean of 12+log(O/H)=7.72 +/- 0.01 is taken as the
representative oxygen abundance for Mrk178. A localized N and He enrichment,
spatially correlated with WR stars, is suggested by this analysis. Nebular
HeII4686 emission is shown to be spatially extended reaching well beyond the

be explained based on the mechanical energy input into the ISM by the WR star
winds, and does not rule out WR stars as the HeII ionization source. We study

The practicality of existing works addressing this challenge is being
undermined due to either the restrictive assumptions of the other agents'
behavior, the failure in accounting for their rationality, or the prohibitively

practicality of research in this field, we investigate how intention prediction
can be efficiently exploited and made practical in planning, thereby leading to
efficient intention-aware planning frameworks capable of predicting the

as an antiseptic if it was understood why the solution's rapid killing of
microbes does not cause any harm to humans or to animals. Our aim was to study
both theoretically and experimentally its reaction-diffusion mechanism to find
the source of that selectivity. Methods ClO2 permeation measurements through
protein membranes were performed and the time delay of ClO2 transport due to
reaction and diffusion was determined. To calculate ClO2 penetration depths and
estimate bacterial killing times, approximate solutions of the
reaction-diffusion equation were derived. Additionally, as a preliminary test,
three patients with infected wounds were treated with a 300 ppm high purity
ClO2 solution and the healing process was documented. Results The rate law of
the reaction-diffusion model predicts that the killing time is proportional to
the square of the characteristic size (e.g. diameter) of a body, thus, small
ones will be killed extremely fast. For example, the killing time for a
bacterium is on the order of milliseconds in a 300 ppm ClO2 solution. Thus, the
few minutes of contact time (owing to the volatility of ClO2) is quite enough
to kill all bacteria, but short enough to keep ClO2 penetration into the living
tissues safely below 0.1 mm, minimizing cytotoxic effects. Pictures of
successful wound healings confirm these considerations. Various properties of
ClO2, advantageous for an antiseptic, are also discussed. Most importantly,
bacteria are not able to develop resistance against ClO2 as it reacts with
biological thiols which play a vital role in all living organisms. Conclusion
Selectivity of ClO2 between humans and bacteria is based not on their different
biochemistry, but on their different size. Preliminary clinical results
encourage further research with this promising local antiseptic.

read-once quantum formula over Toffoli and single-qubit gates is equivalent to
a read-once classical formula over Toffoli and NOT gates. We then show that the

to their host stars (""hot Jupiters""), can largely be accounted for by planetary
migration, associated with viscous evolution of proto-planetary nebulae.
Recently, observations of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect during planetary
transits have revealed that a considerable fraction of detected hot Jupiters
reside on orbits that are misaligned with respect to the spin-axes of their
host stars. This observational fact has cast significant doubts on the
importance of disk-driven migration as a mechanism for production of hot
Jupiters, thereby reestablishing the origins of close-in planetary orbits as an
open question. Here we show that misaligned orbits can be a natural consequence
of disk migration. Our argument rests on an enhanced abundance of binary
stellar companions in star formation environments, whose orbital plane is
uncorrelated with the spin axes of the individual stars. We analyze the
dynamical evolution of idealized proto-planetary disks under perturbations from
massive distant bodies and demonstrate that the resulting gravitational torques
act to misalign the orbital planes of the disks relative to the spin poles of
their host stars. As a result, we predict that in the absence of strong
disk-host star angular momentum coupling or sufficient dissipation that acts to
realign the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbits, the fraction of
planetary systems (including systems of hot Neptunes and Super-Earths), whose
angular momentum vectors are misaligned with respect to their host-stars should
be commensurate with the rate of primordial stellar multiplicity.

Luttinger liquid wires threaded by a magnetic flux, allowing for different

representation in the scattering state picture, allowing for a direct
calculation of the linear response conductances, without the need of
introducing contact resistances at the connection points to the outer ideal
leads. The matrix of conductances is parametrized by three variables. For these
we derive coupled renormalization group (RG) equations, by summing up infinite
classes of contributions in perturbation theory. The resulting general
structure of the RG equations may be employed to describe junctions with an
arbitrary number of wires and arbitrary interaction strength in each wire. The
fixed point structure of these equations (for the chiral Y-junction) is
analyzed in detail. For repulsive interaction (g,g_3>0) there is only one
stable fixed point, corresponding to the complete separation of the wires. For
attractive interaction (g<0 and/or g_3<0) four fixed points are found, the
stability of which depends on the interaction strength. We confirm our previous
weak-coupling result of lines of fixed points for special values of the
interaction parameters reaching into the strong coupling domain. We find new
fixed points not discussed before, even at the symmetric line g=g_3, at
variance with the results of Oshikawa et al. The pair tunneling phenomenon
conjectured by the latter authors is not found by us.

local descriptors like SIFT demonstrate great discriminative power in solving
vision problems like object recognition, image classification and annotation,
more and more state-of-the-art large scale image retrieval systems are trying
to rely on them. A common way to achieve this is first quantizing local
descriptors into visual words, and then applying scalable textual indexing and
retrieval schemes. We call this model as bag-of-words or bag-of-features model.
The goal of this survey is to give an overview of this model and introduce
different strategies when building the system based on this model.

stochastic reaction-diffusion simulations. It is a multiscale (hybrid)
algorithm which uses stochastic reaction-diffusion models with different levels
of detail in different parts of the computational domain. The coupling
condition on the interface between different modelling regimes of the TRM was
previously derived for one-dimensional models. In this paper, the TRM is
generalized to higher dimensional reaction-diffusion systems. Coupling Brownian
dynamics models with compartment-based models on regular (square)
two-dimensional lattices is studied in detail. In this case, the interface
between different modelling regimes contain either flat parts or right-angled
corners. Both cases are studied in the paper. For flat interfaces, it is shown
that the one-dimensional theory can be used along the line perpendicular to the
TRM interface. In the direction tangential to the interface, two choices of the
TRM parameters are presented. Their applicability depends on the compartment
size and the time step used in the molecular-based regime. The two-dimensional
generalization of the TRM is also discussed in the case of corners.

superparticles, especially squarks and gluinos, are not so light as we
expected. It is important to investigate SUSY searches which do not rely on the
colored superparticles.
  As a clue for the investigation, we focus on the muon g-2 anomaly, which can
be explained by the SUSY contributions if some of neutralinos, charginos, and
sleptons are as light as of order 100 GeV. We propose the muon-(g-2)-motivated
MSSM as a benchmark model, where squarks are decoupled but the superparticles
corresponding to the muon g-2 are light enough to explain the anomaly. We also
interpret the up-to-date results of LHC SUSY searches, and obtain experimental
constraints on the model.
  We show searches for direct production of charginos and neutralinos work very
well against the scenario, but several regions are not only remain uncovered
but even found challenging to be searched for at the LHC. It is ascertained
that, in order to draw out latent potential of the LHC, strategies to attack
these regions should be developed.

designed around the dual capability of the Timepix ASICs to provide information
about either the deposited charge or the timing information from tracks
traversing the 14 x 14mm matrix of 55 x 55 um pixels. The rate of reconstructed
tracks available is optimised by taking advantage of the shutter driven readout
architecture of the Timepix chip, operated with existing readout systems.
Results of tests conducted in the SPS North Area beam facility at CERN show
that the telescope typically provides reconstructed track rates during the beam
spills of between 3.5 and 7.5 kHz, depending on beam conditions. The tracks are
time stamped with 1 ns resolution with an efficiency of above 98% and provide a
pointing resolution at the centre of the telescope of 1.6 um . By dropping the
time stamping requirement the rate can be increased to 15 kHz, at the expense
of a small increase in background. The telescope infrastructure provides CO2
cooling and a flexible mechanical interface to the device under test, and has
been used for a wide range of measurements during the 2011-2012 data taking
campaigns.

the concept of geometric phases, which are acquired whenever a quantum system
evolves along a closed path in Hilbert space. The geometric phase is determined
only by the shape of this path and is -- in its simplest form -- a real number.
However, if the system contains degenerate energy levels, matrix-valued
geometric phases, termed non-abelian holonomies, can emerge. They play an
important role for the creation of synthetic gauge fields in cold atomic gases
and the description of non-abelian anyon statistics. Moreover, it has been
proposed to exploit non-abelian holonomic gates for robust quantum computation.
In contrast to abelian geometric phases, non-abelian ones have been observed
only in nuclear quadrupole resonance experiments with a large number of spins
and without fully characterizing the geometric process and its non-commutative
nature. Here, we realize non-abelian holonomic quantum operations on a single
superconducting artificial three-level atom by applying a well controlled
two-tone microwave drive. Using quantum process tomography, we determine
fidelities of the resulting non-commuting gates exceeding 95 %. We show that a
sequence of two paths in Hilbert space traversed in different order yields
inequivalent transformations, which is an evidence for the non-abelian
character of the implemented holonomic quantum gates. In combination with
two-qubit operations, they form a universal set of gates for holonomic quantum
computation.

  Heliospheric Modulation","16 pages, 7 figures",,"10.1007/s11207-013-0341-5",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The ability to predict times of greater galactic cosmic ray (GCR) fluxes is
important for reducing the hazards caused by these particles to satellite
communications, aviation, or astronauts. The 11-year solar cycle variation in
cosmic rays is highly correlated with the strength of the heliospheric magnetic
field. Differences in GCR flux during alternate solar cycles yield a 22-year
cycle, known as the Hale Cycle, which is thought to be due to different
particle drift patterns when the northern solar pole has predominantly positive
(denoted a qA>0 cycle) or negative (qA<0) polarities. This results in the onset
of the peak cosmic ray flux at Earth occurring earlier during qA>0 cycles than
for qA<0 cycles and hence the peak being more domed for qA>0 and more sharply
peaked for qA<0. In this study, we demonstrate that properties of the
large-scale heliospheric magnetic field are different during the declining
phase of the qA<0 and qA>0 solar cycles, when the difference in GCR flux is
most apparent. This suggests that particle drifts may not be the sole mechanism
responsible for the Hale Cycle in GCR flux at Earth. However, it is also
demonstrated that these polarity-dependent heliospheric differences are evident
during the space-age but much less clear in earlier data: using geomagnetic
reconstructions, it is shown that for the period of 1905 - 1965, alternate
polarities do not give as significant a difference during the declining phase
of the solar cycle. Thus we suggest that the 22-year cycle in cosmic ray flux
is at least partly the result of direct modulation by the heliospheric magnetic
field and that this effect may be primarily limited to the grand solar maximum
of the space-age.

appearance of a quantum-critical glass phase of atomic spins has been predicted
recently. Due to the long-range nature of the cavity-mediated interactions, but
also the presence of a driving laser and dissipative processes such as cavity
photon loss, the quantum optical realization of glassy physics has no analog in
condensed matter, and could evolve into a ""cavity glass microscope"" for
frustrated quantum systems out-of-equilibrium. Here we develop the
non-equilibrium theory of the multimode Dicke model with quenched disorder and
Markovian dissipation. Using a unified Keldysh path integral approach, we show
that the defining features of a low temperature glass, representing a critical
phase of matter with algebraically decaying temporal correlation functions, are
seen to be robust against the presence of dissipation due to cavity loss. The
universality class however is modified due to the Markovian bath. The presence
of strong disorder leads to an enhanced equilibration of atomic and photonic
degrees of freedom, including the emergence of a common low-frequency effective
temperature. The imprint of the atomic spin glass physics onto a ""photon glass""
makes it possible to detect the glass state by standard experimental techniques
of quantum optics. We provide an unambiguous characterization of the
superradiant and glassy phases in terms of fluorescence spectroscopy, homodyne
detection, and the temporal photon correlation function $g^{(2)}(\tau)$.

direct optimizations to portions of the code where most resources are consumed.
This powerful methodology, called path profiling, was introduced by Ball and
Larus in the mid 90s and has received considerable attention in the last 15
years for its practical relevance. A shortcoming of Ball-Larus path profiling
was the inability to profile cyclic paths, making it difficult to mine
interesting execution patterns that span multiple loop iterations. Previous
results, based on rather complex algorithms, have attempted to circumvent this
limitation at the price of significant performance losses already for a small
number of iterations. In this paper, we present a new approach to multiple
iterations path profiling, based on data structures built on top of the
original Ball-Larus numbering technique. Our approach allows it to profile all
executed paths obtained as a concatenation of up to k Ball-Larus acyclic paths,
where k is a user-defined parameter. An extensive experimental investigation on
a large variety of Java benchmarks on the Jikes RVM shows that, surprisingly,
our approach can be even faster than Ball-Larus due to fewer operations on
smaller hash tables, producing compact representations of cyclic paths even for
large values of k.

employs a canonical K\""{a}hler potential. The inflationary potential takes into
account both radiative and supergravity corrections, as well as an important
soft supersymmetry breaking term, with a mass coefficient in the range $(0.1 -
10)~{\rm TeV}$. The latter term assists in obtaining a scalar spectral index
$n_s$ close to $0.96$, as strongly suggested by the PLANCK and WMAP-9yr
measurements. The minimal model predicts that the tensor-to-scalar $r$ is
extremely tiny, of order $10^{-12}$, while the spectral index running,
$|dn_{\rm s}/d\ln k| \sim 10^{-4}$. If inflation is associated with the
breaking of a local $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry, the corresponding symmetry breaking
scale $M$ is $(0.7 - 1.6)\cdot10^{15}~{\rm GeV}$ with $n_{\rm s} \simeq 0.96$.
This scenario is compatible with the bounds on $M$ from cosmic strings, formed
at the end of inflation from $B-L$ symmetry breaking. We briefly discuss
non-thermal leptogenesis which is readily implemented in this class of models.

the dust temperature, the CO excitation temperature derived from submm/FIR

near-IR spectra provide complementary information to the submm lines by probing
not only the cold outer envelope but also the warm inner region. The near-IR
high-J (>8) absorption lines are particularly sensitive to the physical

without fine-tuning. The difference of the Yukawa coupling matrices between the
down-type quarks and charged leptons is discussed. We show that some special

R-parity remains even after we take into account the SU(1,1) breaking effects
from all the VEVs of the structure and matter fields. The assignments forbid
the baryon and/or lepton number violating terms except a superpotential quartic

This work provides an in-depth analysis of the (local and global) minimizers of
an objective function $\Fd$ combining a quadratic data-fidelity term and an
$\ell_0$ penalty applied to each entry of the sought-after solution, weighted
by a regularization parameter $\be>0$. For several decades, this objective has
attracted a ceaseless effort to conceive algorithms approaching a good
minimizer. Our theoretical contributions, summarized below, shed new light on
the existing algorithms and can help the conception of innovative numerical
schemes. To solve the normal equation associated with any $\m$-row submatrix of
$A$ is equivalent to compute a local minimizer $\hu$ of $\Fd$. (Local)
minimizers $\hu$ of $\Fd$ are strict if and only if the submatrix, composed of
those columns of $A$ whose indexes form the support of $\hu$, has full column
rank. An outcome is that strict local minimizers of $\Fd$ are easily computed
without knowing the value of $\be$. Each strict local minimizer is linear in
data. It is proved that $\Fd$ has global minimizers and that they are always
strict. They are studied in more details under the (standard) assumption that
$\rank(A)=\m<\n$. The global minimizers with $\m$-length support are seen to be
impractical. Given $d$, critical values $\be_\k$ for any $\k\leq\m-1$ are
exhibited such that if $\be>\be_\k$, all global minimizers of $\Fd$ are
$\k$-sparse. An assumption on $A$ is adopted and proved to fail only on a
closed negligible subset. Then for all data $d$ beyond a closed negligible
subset, the objective $\Fd$ for $\be>\be_\k$, $\k\leq\m-1$, has a unique global
minimizer and this minimizer is $\k$-sparse. Instructive small-size ($5\x 10$)
numerical illustrations confirm the main theoretical results.

under successive cancellation list decoding, their scaling exponent is studied
as a function of the list size. In particular, the error probability is fixed
and the trade-off between block length and back-off from capacity is analyzed.
A lower bound is provided on the error probability under $\rm MAP$ decoding
with list size $L$ for any binary-input memoryless output-symmetric channel and
for any class of linear codes such that their minimum distance is unbounded as
the block length grows large. Then, it is shown that under $\rm MAP$ decoding,
although the introduction of a list can significantly improve the involved
constants, the scaling exponent itself, i.e., the speed at which capacity is
approached, stays unaffected for any finite list size. In particular, this
result applies to polar codes, since their minimum distance tends to infinity
as the block length increases. A similar result is proved for genie-aided
successive cancellation decoding when transmission takes place over the binary
erasure channel, namely, the scaling exponent remains constant for any fixed
number of helps from the genie. Note that since genie-aided successive
cancellation decoding might be strictly worse than successive cancellation list
decoding, the problem of establishing the scaling exponent of the latter
remains open.

EWs, which we attribute to an increase in mid-IR continuum from the AGN. We
find that in both the IRAGN and non-IRAGN samples, the PAH luminosities
correlate strongly with the [Ne II] emission, from which we conclude that the
PAH luminosity directly traces the instantaneous SFR in both the IRAGN and
non-IRAGN galaxies. We compare the ratio of PAH luminosity to the total IR
luminosity and show that for most IRAGN star-formation accounts for 10-50% of
the L(IR). We also find no measurable difference between the PAH luminosity
ratios of L(11.3)/L(7.7) and L(6.2)/L(7.7) for the IRAGN and non-IRAGN,
suggesting that AGN do not significantly excite or destroy PAH molecules on
galaxy-wide scales. A small subset of galaxies show excess of [O IV] emission
compared to their PAH emission, which indicates the presence of
heavily-obscured AGN, including 3 galaxies that are not otherwise selected as

Understanding how configuration reflects on the coupled behavior in a system of

patterns that appear in brain networks, and their individual effects on network
dynamics, are far from being fully understood.
  We study the connections between edge configuration and dynamics in a simple
oriented network composed of two interconnected cliques (representative of
brain feedback regulatory circuitry). In this paper, our main goal is to study
the spectra of the graph adjacency and Laplacian matrices, with a focus on
three aspects in particular: (1) the sensitivity/robustness the spectrum in
response to varying the intra and inter-modular edge density, (2) the effects
on the spectrum of perturbing the edge configuration, while keeping the
densities fixed and (3) the effects of increasing the network size. We study
some tractable aspects analytically, then simulate more general results
numerically. This paper aims to clarify, from analytical and modeling
perspectives, the underpinnings of our related work, which further addresses
how graph properties affect the network's temporal dynamics and phase

sign between the single transverse spin asymmetries measured in semi-inclusive
deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) and in the Drell-Yan process (DY). This
asymmetry is known to arise due to the transverse spin dependence of the target
proton combined with a T-odd complex phase. Using the discrete symmetry
properties of transverse spinors, we show that the required complex phase
originates in the denominators of rescattering diagrams and their respective
cuts. For simplicity, we work in a model where the proton consists of a valence
quark and a scalar diquark. We then show that the phases generated in SIDIS and
in DY originate from distinctly different cuts in the amplitudes, which at
first appears to obscure the relationship between the single-spin asymmetries
in the two processes. Nevertheless, further analysis demonstrates that the
contributions of these cuts are identical in the leading-twist Bjorken
kinematics considered, resulting in the standard sign-flip relation between the
Sivers functions in SIDIS and DY. Physically, this fundamental, but yet
untested, prediction occurs because the Sivers effect in the Drell-Yan reaction
is modified by the initial-state ""lensing"" interactions of the annihilating
antiquark, in contrast to the final-state lensing which produces the Sivers
effect in deep inelastic scattering.

sometimes shows enigmatic periodic flux variations over several 10-100 days. In
this Letter, we propose that this periodic variations could be explained by the
pulsation of massive protostars growing under rapid mass accretion with rates
of Mdot > 10^-3 Msun/yr. Our stellar evolution calculations predict that the
massive protostars have very large radius exceeding 100 Rsun at maximum, and we
here study the pulsational stability of such the bloated protostars by way of
the linear stability analysis. We show that the protostar becomes pulsationally
unstable with various periods of several 10-100 days, depending on different
accretion rates. With the fact that the stellar luminosity when the star is
pulsationally unstable also depends on the accretion rate, we derive the
period-luminosity relation log (L/Lsun) = 4.62 + 0.98log(P/100 day), which is
testable with future observations. Our models further show that the radius and
mass of the pulsating massive protostar should also depend on the period. It
would be possible to infer such protostellar properties and the accretion rate
with the observed period. Measuring the maser periods enables a direct
diagnosis of the structure of accreting massive protostars, which are deeply
embedded in dense gas and inaccessible with other observations.

Stanway (2009) to create a benchmark population of star forming regions to act
as a reference for our observations. Based on those models, we identify a zone
of parameter space populated by regions that cannot be obtained with a cluster
mass dependent truncation in the stellar IMF imposed. We find that the
investigated galaxies display small subpopulations of star forming regions
falling within our zone of interest, which appears to be inconsistent with
imposing an IMF truncation at maximum stellar mass dependent on the total
cluster mass. The presence of those regions is expected in models using both
stochastic and sorted sampling of the full extent of the stellar IMF. This
result persists after taking dust attenuation effects into account. We
highlight the significance of stochastic effects in environments with low star

the notion of proximity of two traces is not the usual least-squares distance,
but instead involves registration as in image processing. Observed data are
matched to predicted waveforms via piecewise-polynomial warpings, obtained by
solving a nonconvex optimization problem in a multiscale fashion from low to
high frequencies. This multiscale process requires defining low-frequency
augmented signals in order to seed the frequency sweep at zero frequency.
Custom adjoint sources are then defined from the warped waveforms. The proposed
velocity updates are obtained as the migration of these adjoint sources, and
cannot be interpreted as the negative gradient of any given objective function.
The new method, referred to as RGLS, is successfully applied to a few scenarios
of model velocity estimation in the transmission setting. We show that the new
method can converge to the correct model in situations where conventional
least-squares inversion suffers from cycle-skipping and converges to a spurious
model.

Calabi-Yau with dimension at most one. We extend the notion of Calabi-Yau
reduction to this setting, and prove general results which are an analogue of
known results in cluster theory.
  Such categories appear naturally in the setting of Gorenstein singularities
in dimension three as the stable categories of Cohen-Macaulay modules. We
explain the connection between Calabi-Yau reduction of $\underline{\rm CM} R$
and both partial crepant resolutions and Q-factorial terminalizations of Spec
R, and we show under quite general assumptions that Calabi-Yau reductions
exist.

$\underline{\rm CM} R$, we give a complete classification of maximal modifying
modules in terms of the symmetric group, generalizing and strengthening results
in [BIKR] and [DH], where we do not need any restriction on the ground field.
We also describe the mutation of modifying modules at an arbitrary (not
necessarily indecomposable) direct summand. As a corollary when the field is
the complex numbers, we obtain many autoequivalences of the derived category of
the Q-factorial terminalizations of Spec R.

of social behavior, where individuals are affected by their personal
preferences and observation of the neighbors' behavior. Individuals are
arranged in a network (usually, the square lattice) and each has a state and a
fixed threshold for behavior changes. We simulate the system asynchronously
either by picking a random individual and either update its state or exchange
it with another randomly chosen individual (mixing). We describe the dynamics
analytically in the fast-mixing limit by using the mean-field approximation and
investigate it mainly numerically in case of a finite mixing. We show that the
dynamics converge to a manifold in state space, which determines the possible
equilibria, and show how to estimate the projection of manifold by using
simulated trajectories, emitted from different initial points.
  We show that the effects of considering the network can be decomposed into
finite-neighborhood effects, and finite-mixing-rate effects, which have
qualitatively similar effects. Both of these effects increase the tendency of
the system to move from a less-desired equilibrium to the ""ground state"". Our
findings can be used to probe shifts in behavioral norms and have implications
for the role of information flow in determining when social norms that have
become unpopular (such as foot binding or female genital cutting) persist or

cluster NGC 3766 based on a 7-year multi-band monitoring campaign conducted on
the 1.2 m Swiss Euler telescope at La Silla, Chili.
  Methods. The data reduction, light curve cleaning and period search
procedures, combined with the long observation time line, allow us to detect
variability amplitudes down to the milli-magnitude level. The variability
properties are complemented with the positions in the color-magnitude and
color-color diagrams to classify periodic variable stars into distinct
variability types.
  Results. We find a large population (36 stars) of new variable stars between
the red edge of slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars and the blue edge of delta Sct
stars, a region in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram where no pulsation is
predicted to occur based on standard stellar models. The bulk of their periods
ranges from 0.1 to 0.7 d, with amplitudes between 1 and 4 mmag for the majority
of them. About 20% of stars in that region of the HR diagram are found to be
variable, but the number of members of this new group is expected to be higher,
with amplitudes below our milli-magnitude detection limit.
  The properties of this new group of variable stars are summarized, and
arguments set forth in favor of a pulsation origin of the variability, with
g-modes sustained by stellar rotation. Potential members of this new class of
low-amplitude periodic (most probably pulsating) A and late-B variables in the
literature are discussed.
  We additionally identify 16 eclipsing binary, 13 SPB, 14 delta Sct and 12
gamma Dor candidates, as well as 72 fainter periodic variables. All are new
discoveries.
  Conclusions. We encourage to search for the existence of this new class of
variables in other young open clusters, especially in those hosting a rich
population of Be stars.

rewrite the social loss function as a function of $\pi$. The answer is achieved

emission-line object which is quickly approaching the Galaxy's central black

systems on the W. M. Keck I and II telescopes and include spectroscopy (R ~
3600) centered on the Hydrogen Br-gamma line as well as K' (2.1 micrometer) and
L' (3.8 micrometer) imaging. Analysis of these observations shows the Br-gamma
line emission has a positional offset from the L' continuum. This offset is
likely due to background source confusion at L'. We therefore present the first
orbital solution derived from Br-gamma line astrometry, which when coupled with
radial velocity measurements, results in a later time of closest approach
(2014.21 +/- 0.14), closer periastron (130 AU, 1900Rs), and higher eccentricity
(0.9814 +/- 0.0060) compared to a solution using L' astrometry. The new orbit
casts doubt on previous associations of G2 and a low surface brightness ""tail"".
It is shown that G2 has no K' counterpart down to K' ~ 20 mag. G2's L'
continuum and the Br-gamma line-emission is unresolved in almost all epochs;
however it is marginally extended in our highest quality Br-gamma data set from
2006 and exhibits a clear velocity gradient at that time. While the
observations altogether suggest that G2 has a gaseous component which is
tidally interacting with the central black hole, there is likely a central star
providing the self-gravity necessary to sustain the compact nature of this
object.

and quasimonotonicity for the proximal point method. These three algorithms are
tested and their solution quality, convergence, and computational efficiency

ultracool dwarf binary system (L0+L1.5). The newly discovered period, together
with the established period via radio observations of the other component, and
the well constrained orbital parameters and rotational velocity measurements,
allow us to infer alignment of the equatorial planes of both components with
the orbital plane of the system to within 10 degrees. This result suggests that
solar-type binary formation mechanisms may extend down into the brown dwarf
mass range, and we consider a number of formation theories that may be
applicable in this case. This is the first such observational result in the
very low mass binary regime. In addition, the detected period of 3.32 $\pm$
0.15 hours implies that the reported radio period of 2.07 $\pm$ 0.002 hours is
associated with the secondary star, not the primary, as was previously claimed.

16, 22, and 42, which describe a sequence in terms of gas richness, from space-
(Swift, HST, Spitzer) and ground-based (LCO, CTIO) imaging and spectroscopy. We
study various signs of past interactions including a faint, dusty tidal feature
about HCG 16A, which we tentatively age-date at <1 Gyr. This represents the
possible detection of a tidal feature at the end of its phase of optical
observability. Our HST images also resolve what were thought to be double
nuclei in HCG 16C and D into multiple, distinct sources, likely to be star
clusters. Beyond our phenomenological treatment, we focus primarily on
contrasting the stellar populations across these three groups. The star
clusters show a remarkable intermediate-age population in HCG 22, and identify
the time at which star formation was quenched in HCG 42. We also search for
dwarf galaxies at accordant redshifts. The inclusion of 33 members and 27
'associates' (possible members) radically changes group dynamical masses, which
in turn may affect previous evolutionary classifications. The extended
membership paints a picture of relative isolation in HCGs 16 and 22, but shows
HCG 42 to be part of a larger structure, following a dichotomy expected from
recent studies. We conclude that (a) star cluster populations provide an
excellent metric of evolutionary state, as they can age-date the past epochs of
star formation; and (b) the extended dwarf galaxy population must be considered
in assessing the dynamical state of a compact group.

ad hoc networks is the prevention of a near-far problem. This paper considers
two types of guard zones that may be used to control the near-far problem: a
fundamental exclusion zone and an additional CSMA guard zone that may be
established by the carrier-sense multiple-access (CSMA) protocol. In the
exclusion zone, no mobiles are physically present, modeling the minimum
physical separation among mobiles that is always present in actual networks.
Potentially interfering mobiles beyond a transmitting mobile's exclusion zone,
but within its CSMA guard zone, are deactivated by the protocol. This paper
provides an analysis of DS-CSMA networks with either or both types of guard
zones. A network of finite extent with a finite number of mobiles and uniform
clustering as the spatial distribution is modeled. The analysis applies a
closed-form expression for the outage probability in the presence of Nakagami
fading, conditioned on the network geometry. The tradeoffs between exclusion
zones and CSMA guard zones are explored for DS-CDMA and unspread networks. The
spreading factor and the guard-zone radius provide design flexibility in
achieving specified levels of average outage probability and transmission
capacity. The advantage of an exclusion zone over a CSMA guard zone is that
since the network is not thinned, the number of active mobiles remains
constant, and higher transmission capacities can be achieved.

positive Lebesgue measure if $\dH(E)>d-1$, which is a sharp bound for this

  Math. 607, Amer. Math. Soc., Providence, RI, 2014",,,"math.KT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Some 15 years ago M. Kontsevich and A. Rosenberg [KR] proposed a heuristic
principle according to which the family of schemes ${Rep_n(A)}$ parametrizing
the finite-dimensional represen- tations of a noncommutative algebra A should
be thought of as a substitute or ""approximation"" for Spec(A). The idea is that
every property or noncommutative geometric structure on A should induce a
corresponding geometric property or structure on $Rep_n(A)$ for all n. In
recent years, many interesting structures in noncommutative geometry have
originated from this idea. In practice, however, if an associative algebra A
possesses a property of geometric nature (e.g., A is a NC complete
intersection, Cohen-Macaulay, Calabi-Yau, etc.), it often happens that, for
some n, the scheme $Rep_n(A)$ fails to have the corresponding property in the
usual algebro-geometric sense. The reason for this seems to be that the
representation functor $Rep_n$ is not ""exact"" and should be replaced by its
derived functor $DRep_n$ (in the sense of non-abelian homological algebra). The
higher homology of $DRep_n(A)$, which we call representation homology,
obstructs $Rep_n(A)$ from having the desired property and thus measures the
failure of the Kontsevich-Rosenberg ""approximation."" In this paper, which is
mostly a survey, we prove several results confirming this intuition. We also
give a number of examples and explicit computations illustrating the theory
developed in [BKR] and [BR].

matches the gain spectrum in the signal band. However, the intensity difference
noise of the twin beams, which weakly depends on the joint spectral function,

fields. Partial frequency redistribution (PRD) is necessary to interpret the
linear polarization observed in strong resonance lines. Usually angle-averaged
PRD functions are used to analyze linear polarization. However it is
established that angle-dependent PRD functions are often necessary to interpret
polarization profiles formed in the presence of weak magnetic fields. Our aim
is to present an efficient decomposition technique, and the numerical method to
solve the concerned angle-dependent line transfer problem. Together with the
standard Stokes decomposition technique we employ Fourier expansion over the
outgoing azimuth angle to express in a more convenient form, the
angle-dependent PRD function for the Hanle effect. It allows the use of
angle-dependent frequency domains of Bommier to solve the Hanle transfer
problem. Such an approach is self-consistent and accurate compared to a recent
approach where angle-averaged frequency domains were used to solve the same
problem. We show that it is necessary to incorporate angle-dependent frequency
domains instead of angle-averaged frequency domains to solve the Hanle transfer
problem accurately, especially for the Stokes U parameter. The importance of
using angle-dependent domains has been highlighted by taking the example of
Hanle effect in the case of line transfer with vertical magnetic fields in a
slab atmosphere. We have also studied the case of polarized line formation when
micro-turbulent magnetic fields are present. The difference between
angle-averaged and angle-dependent solutions is enhanced by the presence of
micro-turbulent fields.

identified 577 young stellar objects (YSOs), of which, 163 are Class I, 400 are
Class II and 14 are transition disk YSOs. Spatial distribution of the candidate
YSOs shows that they are mostly clustered around the sub-regions in the western
half of the complex, suggesting enhanced star formation activity towards its
west. Using the spectral energy distribution and optical colour-magnitude
diagram based age analyses, we derived probable evolutionary status of the
sub-regions of Sh2-252. Our analysis shows that the region A is the youngest (~
0.5 Myr), the regions B, C and E are of similar evolutionary stage (~ 1-2 Myr)
and the clusters NGC 2175s and Teu 136 are slightly evolved (~ 2-3 Myr).
Morphology of the region in the 1.1 mm map shows a semi-circular shaped
molecular shell composed of several clumps and YSOs bordering the western
ionization front of Sh2-252. Our analyses suggest that next generation star
formation is currently under way along this border and that possibly
fragmentation of the matter collected during the expansion of the HII region as
one of the major processes responsible for such stars. We observed the densest
concentration of YSOs (mostly Class I, ~ 0.5 Myr) at the western outskirts of
the complex, within a molecular clump associated with water and methanol masers
and we suggest that it is indeed a site of cluster formation at a very early
evolutionary stage, sandwiched between the two relatively evolved CHII regions
A and B.

imposing the responsibility of providing a predefined data amount to users free

Cournot and Bertrand competition, and find a Nash equilibrium of the
competition. An interesting observation is that the increase in user welfare
does not involve MNO profit loss and the increasing amount is higher than the

observed at the Earth in high rigidity cosmic rays. In particular, we ask if
such FDs are caused mainly by coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from the Sun that
are directed towards the Earth, or by their associated shocks. We use the muon
data at cutoff rigidities ranging from 14 to 24 GV from the GRAPES-3 tracking
muon telescope to identify FD events. We select those FD events that have a
reasonably clean profile, and can be reasonably well associated with an
Earth-directed CME and its associated shock. We employ two models: one that
considers the CME as the sole cause of the FD (the CME-only model) and one that
considers the shock as the only agent causing the FD (the shock-only model). We
use an extensive set of observationally determined parameters for both these
models. The only free parameter in these models is the level of MHD turbulence
in the sheath region, which mediates cosmic ray diffusion (into the CME, for
the CME-only model and across the shock sheath, for the shock-only model).
  We find that good fits to the GRAPES-3 multi-rigidity data using the CME-only
model require turbulence levels in the CME sheath region that are only slightly
higher than those estimated for the quiet solar wind. On the other hand,
reasonable model fits with the shock-only model require turbulence levels in
the sheath region that are an order of magnitude higher than those in the quiet
solar wind.
  This observation naturally leads to the conclusion that the Earth-directed
CMEs are the primary contributors to FDs observed in high rigidity cosmic rays.

configuration-dependent classes of asymmetry functions in velocity, kinetic

increasing number of institutions and companies leads to extremely large data
sets. Subset selection in regression is essential when a huge number of
covariates can potentially explain a response variable of interest. The recent
statistical literature has seen an emergence of new selection methods that
provide some type of compromise between implementation (computational speed)
and statistical optimality (e.g., prediction error minimization). Global
methods such as Mallows' $C_p$ have been supplanted by sequential methods such
as stepwise regression. More recently, streamwise regression, faster than the
former, has emerged. A recently proposed streamwise regression approach based
on the variance inflation factor (VIF) is promising, but its least-squares
based implementation makes it susceptible to the outliers inevitable in such
large data sets. This lack of robustness can lead to poor and suboptimal
feature selection. In our case, we seek to predict an individual's educational
attainment using economic and demographic variables. We show how classical VIF
performs this task poorly and a robust procedure is necessary for policy
makers. This article proposes a robust VIF regression, based on fast robust
estimators, that inherits all the good properties of classical VIF in the
absence of outliers, but also continues to perform well in their presence where
the classical approach fails.

estimated deposited energy in the IceCube detector of 1.04 $\pm$ 0.16 and 1.14

$\nu_{e}$ ($\bar\nu_{e}$) interactions within the IceCube detector. The events
were discovered in a search for ultra-high energy neutrinos using data
corresponding to 615.9 days effective livetime. The expected number of
atmospheric background is $0.082 \pm 0.004 \text{(stat)}^{+0.041}_{-0.057}

the atmospheric background-only hypothesis is $2.9\times10^{-3}$ ($2.8\sigma$)

phase. Here we study the origin of this peculiar phase diagram using a five
orbital model constructed from first principles band calculation, and applying
the fluctuation exchange approximation assuming spin fluctuation mediated
pairing. Based on the calculation results, we propose a scenario where the
frustration in momentum space degrades superconductivity in the intermediate x
regime, while antiferromangetism takes place due to a very good nesting. In
order to see whether the present theoretical scenario is consistent with the
actual nature of the competition between superconductivity and
antiferromagnetism, we also perform hydrostatic pressure experiment for
Ca4Al2O6Fe2(As1-xPx)2. In the intermediate x regime where antiferromagnetism
occurs at ambient pressure, applying hydrostatic pressure smears out the
antiferromagnetic transition, but superconductivity does not take place. This
supports our scenario that superconductivity is suppressed by the momentum
space frustration in the intermediate x regime, apart from the presence of the
antiferromangnetism.

representations of SU(4) with $J^P=1/2^+,~3/2^+$. In addition we also include
the $\eta_c N$ and $J/\psi N$ states. The inclusion of these coupled channels
is demanded by heavy quark spin symmetry, since in the large $m_Q$ limit the
$D$ and $D^*$ states are degenerate and are obtained from each other by means
of a spin rotation, under which QCD is invariant. The novelty in the work is
that we use dynamics from the extrapolation of the local hidden gauge model to
SU(4) and we show that this dynamics fully respects the constraints of heavy
quark spin symmetry.
  With the full space of states demanded by the heavy quark spin symmetry and
the dynamics of the local hidden gauge we look for states dynamically generated

$\bar D \Sigma_c^*$, $\bar D^* \Sigma_c$ and $\bar D^* \Sigma_c^*$, decaying
mostly into $\eta_c N$ and $J/\psi N$. All the states appear in isospin $I=1/2$

peculiarity that in $J=5/2$ the state has zero width in the space of states

inelastic scattering is studied numerically within the framework of TMD
factorization that was put forward in 2011. The comparison to previous results
in the literature shows that the treatment of next-to-leading logarithmic
effects is important for the fall-off of the Sivers asymmetry with energy in
the measurable regime. The TMD factorization based approach indicates that the
peak of the Sivers asymmetry falls off with energy scale Q to good
approximation as 1/Q^{0.7}, somewhat faster than found previously based on the
first TMD factorization expressions by Collins and Soper in 1981. It is found
that the peak of the asymmetry moves rather slowly towards higher transverse
momentum values as $Q$ increases, which may be due to the absence of
perturbative tails of the TMDs in the presented treatments. We conclude that
the behavior of the peak of the asymmetry as a function of energy {\it and}
transverse momentum allows for valuable tests of the TMD formalism and the
considered approximations. To confront the TMD approach with experiment, high
energy experimental data from an Electron-Ion Collider is required.

shown that the resonant tunneling current is a periodic function of the width
of the spacer layer. We have also demonstrated that the simultaneous change of
the source-drain voltage and the voltage applied to the gate located near the
nanowire leads to almost periodic changes of the resonant tunneling current as
a function of the source-drain and gate voltages. The periodic properties of
the resonant tunneling current result from the formation of the Stark resonance
states. If we change the electric field acting in the nanowire, the Stark
states periodically acquire the energies from the transport window and enhance
the tunneling current in a periodic manner. We have found that the separations
between the resonant current peaks on the source-drain voltage scale can be
described by a slowly increasing linear function of the Stark state quantum
number. This allows us to identify the quantum states that are responsible for
the enhancement of the resonant tunneling. We have proposed a method of the

non-unitary interaction of the produced final state rho_f(S) with a universal
quantum environment in the Universe. This new kind of interaction must be a
pure dephasing interaction. If the quantum environment is to be an integral
part of the Nature then its dephasing interactions must be fully consistent
with the Standard Model. In this work we impose on the dephasing interaction
the requirements of the conservation of the identities and four-momenta of the
final state particles, Lorentz symmetry, P-parity and the conservation of total
angular momentum and isospin. From this consistency alone we find that in
piN->pipiN the dephasing interaction must be a dipion spin mixing interaction.
The theory predicts rho^0(770)-f_0(980) mixing in the S- and P-wave amplitudes
in pi(-)p->pi(-)pi(+)n. The predicted moduli and relative phases are in
agreement with experimental results. The spin mixing of S-matrix amplitudes to
form new observable amplitudes is a new phenomenon beyond the Standard Model.
It is our conjecture that the pure dephasing interaction describes the
non-standard interaction of baryonic matter with dark matter and dark energy

trigger cascades of failures across the grid and lead to a large blackout.
Complex network approaches have shown a direction to study some of the problems
faced by power grids. Within Complex Network Analysis structural
vulnerabilities of power grids have been studied mostly using purely
topological approaches, which assumes that flow of power is dictated by
shortest paths. However, this fails to capture the real flow characteristics of
power grids. We have proposed a flow redistribution mechanism that closely
mimics the flow in power grids using the PTDF. With this mechanism we enhance
existing cascading failure models to study the vulnerability of power grids.
  We apply the model to the European high-voltage grid to carry out a
comparative study for a number of centrality measures. `Centrality' gives an
indication of the criticality of network components. Our model offers a way to
find those centrality measures that give the best indication of node
vulnerability in the context of power grids, by considering not only the
network topology but also the power flowing through the network. In addition,
we use the model to determine the spare capacity that is needed to make the
grid robust to targeted attacks. We also show a brief comparison of the end
results with other power grid systems to generalise the result.

species evolve through predefined interactions. Such networks are found as
modeling tools in many biological disciplines such as biochemistry, ecology,
epidemiology, immunology, systems biology and synthetic biology. It is now
well-established that, for small population sizes, stochastic models for
biochemical reaction networks are necessary to capture randomness in the
interactions. The tools for analyzing such models, however, still lag far
behind their deterministic counterparts. In this paper, we bridge this gap by
developing a constructive framework for examining the long-term behavior and
stability properties of the reaction dynamics in a stochastic setting. In
particular, we address the problems of determining ergodicity of the reaction
dynamics, which is analogous to having a globally attracting fixed point for
deterministic dynamics. We also examine when the statistical moments of the
underlying process remain bounded with time and when they converge to their
steady state values. The framework we develop relies on a blend of ideas from
probability theory, linear algebra and optimization theory. We demonstrate that
the stability properties of a wide class of biological networks can be assessed
from our sufficient theoretical conditions that can be recast as efficient and
scalable linear programs, well-known for their tractability. It is notably
shown that the computational complexity is often linear in the number of
species. We illustrate the validity, the efficiency and the wide applicability

thermomagnetic instability in type-II superconducting films. The avalanches,
potentially harmful for superconductor-based devices, can be suppressed by an
adjacent normal metal layer, even when the two layers are not in thermal
contact. The suppression of the avalanches in this case is due to so-called
magnetic braking, caused by eddy currents generated in the metal layer by
propagating magnetic flux. We develop a theory of magnetic braking by analyzing
coupled electrodynamics and heat flow in a superconductor-normal metal bilayer.
The equations are solved by linearization and by numerical simulation of the
avalanche dynamics. We find that in an uncoated superconductor, even a uniform
thermomagnetic instability can develop into a dendritic flux avalanche. The
mechanism is that a small non-uniformity caused by the electromagnetic
non-locality induces a flux-flow hot spot at a random position. The hot spot
quickly develops into a finger, which at high speeds penetrates into the
superconductor, forming a branching structure. Magnetic braking slows the
avalanches, and if the normal metal conductivity is sufficiently high, it can
suppress the formation of the dendritic structure. During avalanches, the
braking by the normal metal layer prevents the temperature from exceeding the
transition temperature of the superconductor. Analytical criteria for the
instability threshold are developed using the linear stability analysis. The
criteria are found to match quantitatively the instability onsets obtained in
simulation.

  Purpose: We aim at calculating proton-${}^3$He elastic scattering observables
above three- and four-cluster breakup threshold.
  Methods: We employ Alt, Grassberger, and Sandhas (AGS) equations for the
four-nucleon transition operators and solve them in the momentum-space
framework using the complex-energy method whose accuracy and practical
applicability is improved by a special integration method.
  Results: Using realistic nuclear interaction models we obtain fully converged
results for the proton-${}^3$He elastic scattering. The differential cross
section, proton and ${}^3$He analyzing powers, spin correlation and spin
transfer coefficients are calculated at proton energies ranging from 7 to 35
MeV. Effective three- and four-nucleon forces are included via the explicit
excitation of a nucleon to a $\Delta$ isobar.
  Conclusions: Realistic proton-${}^3$He scattering calculations above the
four-nucleon breakup threshold are feasible. There is quite good agreement
between the theoretical predictions and experimental data for the
proton-${}^3$He scattering in the considered energy regime. The most remarkable
disagreements are the peak of the proton analyzing power at lower energies and
the minimum of the differential cross section at higher energies. Inclusion of

remains an open question what adaptive mechanisms facilitated its expansion.
Here we show, using gyrencephaly index (GI) and other physiological and
life-history data for 102 mammalian species, that gyrencephaly is an ancestral
mammalian trait. We provide evidence that the evolution of a highly folded
neocortex, as observed in humans, requires the traversal of a threshold of 10^9
neurons, and that species above and below the threshold exhibit a bimodal
distribution of physiological and life-history traits, establishing two
phenotypic groups. We identify, using discrete mathematical models,
proliferative divisions of progenitors in the basal compartment of the
developing neocortex as evolutionarily necessary and sufficient for generating
a fourteen-fold increase in daily prenatal neuron production and thus traversal
of the neuronal threshold. We demonstrate that length of neurogenic period,
rather than any novel progenitor-type, is sufficient to distinguish cortical
neuron number between species within the same phenotypic group.

stochastic distances between relaxed scaled complex Wishart distributions in
their most general form and in important particular cases. Using these
distances, inequalities are obtained which lead to new ways of deriving the
Bartlett and revised Wishart distances. The expressiveness of the four analytic
distances is assessed with respect to the variation of parameters. Such
distances are then used for deriving new tests statistics, which are proved to
have asymptotic chi-square distribution. Adopting the test size as a comparison

power of the tests is also assessed. Applications to actual data illustrate the

system of linear elasticity equations in any space dimension, where the stress
field is approximated by symmetric finite element tensors.
  This family of elements has a perfect matching between the stress components
and the displacement.
  The discrete spaces for the normal stress $\sigma_{ii}$, the shear stress
$\sigma_{ij}$ and the displacement $u_i$ are
  $\operatorname{span}\{1,x_i\}$, $\operatorname{span}\{1,x_i,x_j\}$ and
$\operatorname{span}\{1\}$, respectively, on rectangular grids.
  In particular, the definition remains the same for all space dimensions. As a
result of these choices, the theoretical analysis is independent of the spatial
dimension as well. In 1D, this element is nothing else but the 1D
Raviart-Thomas element, which is the only conforming element in this family. In
2D and higher dimensions, they are new elements but of the minimal degrees of
freedom. The total degrees of freedom per element is 2 plus 1 in 1D, 7 plus 2
in 2D, and 15 plus 3 in 3D.
  The previous record of the least degrees of freedom is, 13 plus 4 in 2D, and
54 plus 12 in 3D, on the rectangular grid.
  These elements are the simplest element for any space dimension.
  The well-posedness condition and the optimal a priori error estimate of the
family of finite elements are proved for both pure displacement and traction
problems. Numerical tests in 2D and 3D are presented to show a superiority of
the new element over others, as a superconvergence is surprisingly exhibited.

a_n^{b_n} >= c_1^{d_1} c_2^{d_2} .... c_m^{d_m} .
  Problem 1 is easily decidable in polynomial time using a simple iterative
algorithm. Problem 2 is much harder. We observe that the complexity of Problem
2 is intimately connected to deep conjectures and results in number theory. In
particular, if a refined form of the ABC conjecture formulated by Baker in 1998
holds, or if the older Lang-Waldschmidt conjecture (formulated in 1978) on
linear forms in logarithms holds, then Problem 2 is decidable in P-time (in the
standard Turing model of computation). Moreover, it follows from the best
available quantitative bounds on linear forms in logarithms, e.g., by Baker and
W\""{u}stholz (1993) or Matveev (2000), that if m and n are fixed universal
constants then Problem 2 is decidable in P-time (without relying on any
conjectures). This latter fact was observed earlier by Shub (1993).
  We describe one application: P-time maximum probability parsing for arbitrary
stochastic context-free grammars (where \epsilon-rules are allowed).

derive conditions under which a Cartan geometry on observer space gives rise to

MacDowell-Mansouri gravity on observer space and Finsler gravity, and translate

Surveys onboard the Hubble Space Telescope. We detected 166 bona fide variables

Lyrae stars despite nearly 100 percent completeness at the magnitude of the
horizontal branch. The RR Lyrae stars include 7 fundamental and 3
first-overtone pulsators, with mean periods of 0.636 and 0.366 day,
respectively. From their position on the period-luminosity (PL) diagram and
light-curve morphology, we classify 91, 58, and 4 Cepheids as fundamental,
first-overtone, and second-overtone mode Classical Cepheids (CC), respectively,
and two as population II Cepheids. However, due to the low metallicity of Leo
A, about 90 percent of the detected Cepheids have periods shorter than 1.5
days. Comparison with theoretical models indicate that some of the fainter
stars classified as CC could be Anomalous Cepheids. We estimate the distance to
Leo A using the tip of the RGB (TRGB) and various methods based on the
photometric and pulsational properties of the Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars. The
distances obtained with the TRGB and RR Lyrae stars agree well with each other
while that from the Cepheid PL relations is somewhat larger, which may indicate
a mild metallicity effect on the luminosity of the short-period Cepheids. Due
to its very low metallicity, Leo A thus serves as a valuable calibrator of the
metallicity dependencies of the variable star luminosities.

shocks associated with the farthest knots. Here we present ALMA Science
Verification data of CO J=2-1 and J=3-2 emission which are spatially coincident
with the blue shifted jet of HH knots, and offset from the disk by -18.6 km/s.
The emission has a double corkscrew morphology and extends more than 10"" from
the disk with embedded emission clumps coincident with jet knots. We interpret
this double corkscrew as emission from material in a molecular disk wind, and
that the compact emission near the jet knots is being heated by the jet which
is moving at much higher velocities. We show that the J=3-2 emission is likely
heavily filtered by the interferometer, but the J=2-1 emission suffers less due
to the larger beam and measurable angular scales. Excitation analysis suggests
temperatures exceeding 900 K in these compact features, with the wind mass,
momentum and energy being of order 10^{-5} M_sun, 10^{-4} M_sun km/s and
10^{40} erg respectively. The high mass loss rate suggests that this star is
dispersing the disk faster than it is funneling mass onto the star.

NMSSM can give 6-8 GeV correction to the SM-like Higgs mass in moderate or
large $\tan\beta$ regions with a small value of the singlet-higgs-higgs
superfields coupling $\lambda\sim\mathcal{O}(0.1)$. This effect comes mainly
from the mixing of the SM-like Higgs with lighter singlet. In the same
parameter range, the mixing of the heavy doublet Higgs with the singlet may
strongly modify the couplings of the singlet-like and the 125 GeV scalars.
Firstly, the LEP bounds on a light singlet can be evaded for a large range of
its masses. Secondly, the decay rates of both scalars can show a variety of
interesting patterns, depending on the lightest scalar mass. In particular, a
striking signature of this mechanism can be a light scalar with strongly
suppressed (enhanced) branching ratios to $b\bar{b}$ ($gg$, $c\bar{c}$,
$\gamma\gamma$) as compared to the SM Higgs with the same mass. The
$\gamma\gamma$ decay channel is particularly promising for the search of such a
scalar at the LHC. The 125 GeV scalar can, thus, be accommodated with
substantially smaller than in the MSSM radiative corrections from the stop
loops (and consequently, with lighter stops) also for moderate or large
$\tan\beta$, with the mixing effects replacing the standard NMSSM mechanism of
increasing the tree level Higgs mass in the low $\tan\beta$ and large $\lambda$
regime, and with clear experimental signatures of such a mechanism.

solar corona is heated to temperatures greater than 1 MK. Though studied for
decades, one of the major difficulties in solving this problem has been
unraveling the line-of-sight (LOS) effects in the observations. The corona is
optically thin, so a single pixel measures counts from an indeterminate number
(perhaps tens of thousands) of independently heated flux tubes, all along that
pixel's LOS. In this paper we model the emission in individual pixels imaging
the active region corona in the Extreme Ultraviolet. If LOS effects are not
properly taken into account, erroneous conclusions regarding both coronal
heating and coronal dynamics may be reached. We model the corona as a LOS
integration of many thousands of completely independently heated flux tubes. We
demonstrate that despite the superposition of randomly heated flux tubes,
nanoflares leave distinct signatures in light curves observed with
multi-wavelength and high time cadence data, such as those data taken with the
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. These
signatures are readily detected with the time-lag analysis technique of Viall &

close to the unitary limit. We work with a local effective action that includes
a dynamical trimer field and we use this field to eliminate structures that do
not correspond to the Faddeev-Yakubovsky equations. In the physical limit, we
find three four-body bound states below the shallowest three-body state. The
values of the scattering lengths at which two of these states become bound are
in good agreement with exact solutions of the four-body equations and
experimental observations. The third state is extremely shallow. During the
evolution we find an infinite number of four-body states based on each
three-body state which follow a double-exponential pattern in the running
scale. None of the four-body states shows any evidence of dependence on a
four-body parameter.

Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) and data analysis have increased enormously
since launch. Thanks to a careful analysis of flight data, we were able to
trace back some of the most significant sources of systematic uncertainties to
using non-optimal calibration constants for some of the detectors. In this
paper we report on a major effort within the LAT Collaboration to update these
constants, to use them to reprocess the first four years of raw data, and to
investigate the improvements observed for low- and high-level analysis. The
Pass 7 reprocessed data, also known as P7REP data, are still being validated
against the original Pass~7 (P7) data by the LAT Collaboration and should be
made public, along with the corresponding instrument response functions, in the
spring of 2013.

their related work. To ease this difficulty, we propose a Personalized Academic
Research Paper Recommendation System, which recommends related articles, for
each researcher, that may be interesting to her/him. In this paper, we first
introduce our web crawler to retrieve research papers from the web. Then, we
define similarity between two research papers based on the text similarity
between them. Finally, we propose our recommender system developed using
collaborative filtering methods. Our evaluation results demonstrate that our
system recommends good quality research papers.

geometry, with the effective Lagrangian of the gravitational field being given
by an arbitrary function of the Ricci scalar, the trace of the matter
energy-momentum tensor, and the contraction of the Ricci tensor with the matter
energy-momentum tensor. The field equations of the model are obtained in the
metric formalism, and the equation of motion of a massive test particle is
derived. In this type of models the matter energy-momentum tensor is generally
not conserved, and this non-conservation determines the appearance of an
extra-force acting on the particles in motion in the gravitational field. The
Newtonian limit of the model is also considered, and an explicit expression for
the extra-acceleration which depends on the matter density is obtained in the
small velocity limit for dust particles. We also analyze in detail the
so-called Dolgov-Kawasaki instability, and obtain the stability conditions of
the model with respect to local perturbations. A particular class of
gravitational field equations can be obtained by imposing the conservation of
the energy-momentum tensor. We derive the corresponding field equations for the
conservative case by using a Lagrange multiplier method, from a gravitational
action that explicitly contains an independent parameter multiplying the
divergence of the energy-momentum tensor. The cosmological implications of the
model are investigated for both the conservative and non-conservative cases,
and several classes of analytical solutions are obtained.

repeatedly proven their ability to well-reproduce its non-linear response on
material as well as structural scales. The major obstacle to a routine
application of this class of models is, however, the calibration of
microplane-related constants from macroscopic data. The goal of this paper is
two-fold: (i) to introduce the basic ingredients of a robust inverse procedure
for the determination of dominant parameters of the M4 model proposed by Bazant
and co-workers based on cascade Artificial Neural Networks trained by
Evolutionary Algorithm and (ii) to validate the proposed methodology against a
representative set of experimental data. The obtained results demonstrate that
the soft computing-based method is capable of delivering the searched response
with an accuracy comparable to the values obtained by expert users.

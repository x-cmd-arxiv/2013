but complete understanding of thermal characteristics of polycrystalline
graphene is still elusive to date. For the first time, herein, we have
systematically studied the effect of temperature on the thermal conductance
behavior of polycrystalline graphene for a range of grain sizes and grain
boundary types, by using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. It is
noted that increasing the tempera-ture remarkably enhances thermal boundary
conductance (Kapitza conductance) across grain boundaries while it deteriorates
thermal conductivities of defect-free grain regions, regardless of grain sizes
and grain boundary types. This enhancement effect becomes more important for
smaller grain sizes and higher temperatures, whose normal adverse effects on
the heat transfer are thus ideally counterbalanced, making total thermal
conductivity rather robust against the temperature increment for sufficiently
small grain sizes. Upon heating from 300 to 500 K, thermal conductivity of
graphene with maximally tilted grain boundaries decreases only by 9 % for a
grain size of 50 nm in contrast to the decrease of 28 % for 250 nm, and
further, it even increases below 30 nm. We presented quantitative mapping of
its (grain, grain boundaries, and total) thermal conductivi-ties in terms with
grain sizes and temperatures, providing a guideline for graphene-based thermal
engineering and suggesting novel defect-based thermal architectures as well.

  with Varying Local Anisotropy",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Gaussian random fields (GRFs) constitute an important part of spatial
modelling, but can be computationally infeasible for general covariance
structures. An efficient approach is to specify GRFs via stochastic partial
differential equations (SPDEs) and derive Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF)
approximations of the solutions. We consider the construction of a class of
non-stationary GRFs with varying local anisotropy, where the local anisotropy
is introduced by allowing the coefficients in the SPDE to vary with position.
This is done by using a form of diffusion equation driven by Gaussian white
noise with a spatially varying diffusion matrix. This allows for the
introduction of parameters that control the GRF by parametrizing the diffusion
matrix. These parameters and the GRF may be considered to be part of a
hierarchical model and the parameters estimated in a Bayesian framework. The
results show that the use of an SPDE with non-constant coefficients is a
promising way of creating non-stationary spatial GMRFs that allow for physical
interpretability of the parameters, although there are several remaining
challenges that would need to be solved before these models can be put to
general practical use.

conditional on $R_i = r$, the random variable $X_i$ has the same distribution
as the $r$-th order statistic within a random sample of size $k$ from an

utilized in situations in which ranking observations is much easier than
obtaining their precise values. Two well-known special cases are ranked set
sampling (McIntyre 1952) and judgement post-stratification (MacEachern et al.
2004).
  Within a general setting including unbalanced ranked set sampling we derive
and compare the asymptotic distributions of three different estimators of the
distribution function $F$ as $n \to \infty$ with fixed $k$: The stratified
estimator of Stokes and Sager (1988), the nonparametric maximum-likelihood
estimator of Kvam and Samaniego (1994) and a moment-based estimator of Chen
(2001). Our functional central limit theorems generalize and refine previous
asymptotic analyses. In addition we discuss briefly pointwise and simultaneous
confidence intervals for the distribution function $F$ with guaranteed coverage
probability for finite sample sizes.
  The methods are illustrated with a real data example, and the potential
impact of imperfect rankings is investigated in a small simulation experiment.
All in all, the moment-based estimator seems to offer a good compromise between
efficiency and robustness versus imperfect ranking, in addition to
computational efficiency.

metallized lower mantle on the dynamos of terrestrial exoplanets using several
inner core sizes and mantle conductivities.
  We find that the addition of an electrically conducting mantle results in
stronger core-mantle boundary fields because of the increase in magnetic field
stretching. We also find that a metallized mantle destabilizes the dynamo
resulting in less dipolar, less axisymmetric poloidal magnetic fields at the
core-mantle boundary. The conducting mantle efficiently screens these fields to
produce weaker surface fields. We conclude that a conducting mantle will make
the detection of extrasolar terrestrial magnetic fields more difficult, while
making the magnetic fields in the dynamo region stronger.

for the stationary probability density and the mean switching time between

In this model, the external state represents the number of protein molecules

degraded. The internal state represents the activated or unactivated state of
the gene; in the activated state the gene produces protein more rapidly than
the unactivated state. The gene is activated by a dimer of the protein it
produces so that the activation rate depends on the current protein level. This
is a well studied model, and several model reductions and diffusion
approximation methods are available to analyze its behavior. However, it is
unclear if these methods accurately approximate long-time metastable behavior

present at the molecular and cellular levels affects dynamics and information
processing at the macroscopic level of synaptically coupled neuronal
populations. Often noise is incorprated into deterministic network models using
extrinsic noise sources. An alternative approach is to assume that noise arises
intrinsically as a collective population effect, which has led to a master
equation formulation of stochastic neural networks. In this paper we extend the
master equation formulation by introducing a stochastic model of neural
population dynamics in the form of a velocity jump Markov process. The latter
has the advantage of keeping track of synaptic processing as well as spiking
activity, and reduces to the neural master equation in a particular limit. The
population synaptic variables evolve according to piecewise deterministic
dynamics, which depends on population spiking activity. The latter is
characterised by a set of discrete stochastic variables evolving according to a
jump Markov process, with transition rates that depend on the synaptic
variables. We consider the particular problem of rare transitions between
metastable states of a network operating in a bistable regime in the
deterministic limit. Assuming that the synaptic dynamics is much slower than
the transitions between discrete spiking states, we use a WKB approximation and
singular perturbation theory to determine the mean first passage time to cross
the separatrix between the two metastable states. Such an analysis can also be
applied to other velocity jump Markov processes, including stochastic
voltage-gated ion channels and stochastic gene networks.

varying edge length. Recent experiments attempted to measure the Aharanov-Bohm
effect by changing the area inside the interferometer using a plunger gate.
Theoretical analyses of these experiments have so far not taken into account
the accompanying change in the edge lengths. We show that the tunnelling
current exhibits multiple osculations as a function of this edge length, with
frequencies proportional to the injected edge current and inversely
proportional to the edge velocities. In particular the edge velocities can be
measured by looking at the Fourier spectrum of the edge current. We provide a
numerical scheme to calculate and plot the $R$ function, and include sample
plots for a variety of edge states with parameter values which are
experimentally relevant.

allows us to investigate the system trajectories through symmetry-breaking
phase transitions. Thus the evolution of both collective modes and single
particle excitations can be followed through diverse phase transitions with
femtosecond resolution. Here we present experimental observations of the order
parameter trajectory in the normal-superconductor transition and charge-density
wave ordering transitions. Of particular interest is the coherent evolution of
topological defects forming during the transition via the Kibble-Zurek
mechanism, which appears to be measurable in optical pump probe experiments.
Experiments on CDW systems reveal some new phenomena, such as coherent
oscillations of the order parameter, the creation and emission of dispersive
amplitudon modes upon the annihilation of topological defects, and mixing with
weakly coupled finite-frequency (massive) bosons.

specifically the problem of obtaining globally optimal transformations that map
between the source space and the channel space, under a given transmission
power constraint and for the mean square error distortion. Particularly, we
focus on the setting where the decoder has access to side information, whose
cost surface is known to be riddled with local minima. Prior work derived the
necessary conditions for optimality of the encoder and decoder mappings, along
with a greedy optimization algorithm that imposes these conditions iteratively,
in conjunction with the heuristic ""noisy channel relaxation"" method to mitigate
poor local minima. While noisy channel relaxation is arguably effective in
simple settings, it fails to provide accurate global optimization results in
more complicated settings including the decoder with side information as
considered in this paper. We propose a global optimization algorithm based on
the ideas of ""deterministic annealing""- a non-convex optimization method,
derived from information theoretic principles with analogies to statistical
physics, and successfully employed in several problems including clustering,
vector quantization and regression. We present comparative numerical results
that show strict superiority of the proposed algorithm over greedy optimization
methods as well as over the noisy channel relaxation.

$\gamma$-ray emission regions, the so-called ""Fermi bubbles"", that extend up to
$\sim 50^\circ$ above and below the Galactic center. The $\gamma$-ray emission
from the bubbles are found to follow a hard spectrum with no significant
spatial variation in intensity and spectral shape. The origin of the emission
is still not clearly understood. Suggested explanations include injection of
cosmic-ray nuclei from the Galactic center by high-speed Galactic winds,
electron acceleration by multiple shocks and stochastic electron acceleration
inside the bubbles. In this letter, it is proposed that the $\gamma$-rays can
be the result of diffusive injection of Galactic cosmic-ray protons during
their propagation through the Galaxy. Considering that the bubbles are slowly
expanding, and cosmic rays undergo much slower diffusion inside the bubbles
than in the averaged Galaxy and at the same time suffer losses due to adiabatic
expansion and inelastic collisions with the bubble plasma, this model can
explain the observed intensity profile, the emission spectrum and the measured
luminosity without invoking any additional particle production processes unlike
other existing models.

light absorption in given materials with only two variables, the radiative loss

between different regimes of order are determined by the underlying dynamics.
These dynamics, in turn, are often constrained by dimensionality and geometry.
For example, in one- and two-dimensional systems with continuous symmetry,
thermal fluctuations prevent the formation of long-range order[1,2].
Two-dimensional systems are particularly significant, as vortices can form in
the plane but cannot tilt out of it. At high temperatures, random motion of
these vortices destroys large-scale coherence. At low temperatures, vortices
with opposite spin can pair together, cancelling their circulation and allowing
quasi-long-range order to appear. This Berezenskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)
transition[3,4] is essentially classical, arising for example in the
traditional XY model for spins, but to date experimental evidence has been
obtained only in cold quantum systems. Measurements of superfluid sound
speed[5] and critical velocity[6] have been consistent with scaling
predictions, and vortices have been observed directly in cold atom
experiments[7,8]. However, the presence of trapping potentials restricts
measurement to vortex density, rather than number, and obscures the process of
vortex unbinding. Further, atom and fluid experiments suffer from parasitic
heating and difficulties in phase recording, leading to results that differ
from theory in many quantitative aspects. Here, we use a nonlinear optical
system to directly observe the ideal BKT transition, including vortex pair
dynamics and the correlation properties of the wavefunction, for both repulsive
and attractiveinteractions (the photonic equivalent of ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic conditions[9]). The results confirm the thermodynamics of the
BKT transition and expose outstanding issues in the crossovers to superfluidity
and Bose-Einstein condensation.

the conditions for the onset of eruption are important issues that can be
addressed through studying the magnetohydrodynamic stability and evolution of
nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) models. This paper uses data-constrained
NLFFF models of a solar active region that erupted on 2010 April 8 as initial
condition in MHD simulations. These models, constructed with the techniques of
flux rope insertion and magnetofrictional relaxation, include a stable, an
approximately marginally stable, and an unstable configuration. The simulations
confirm previous related results of magnetofrictional relaxation runs, in
particular that stable flux rope equilibria represent key features of the
observed pre-eruption coronal structure very well and that there is a limiting
value of the axial flux in the rope for the existence of stable NLFFF
equilibria. The specific limiting value is located within a tighter range, due
to the sharper discrimination between stability and instability by the MHD
description. The MHD treatment of the eruptive configuration yields very good
agreement with a number of observed features like the strongly inclined initial
rise path and the close temporal association between the coronal mass ejection
and the onset of flare reconnection. Minor differences occur in the velocity of
flare ribbon expansion and in the further evolution of the inclination; these
can be eliminated through refined simulations. We suggest that the slingshot
effect of horizontally bent flux in the source region of eruptions can
contribute significantly to the inclination of the rise direction. Finally, we
demonstrate that the onset criterion formulated in terms of a threshold value
for the axial flux in the rope corresponds very well to the threshold of the
torus instability in the considered active region.

curves of KIC\,6382916 are used to investigate the pulsational content and to
identify the principal modes. High-dispersion spectroscopy was also obtained in
order to derive the stellar parameters and projected rotational velocity. From
an analysis of the {\it Kepler} time series, three independent frequencies and
a few hundred combination frequencies are found. The light curve is dominated
by two modes with frequencies $f_{1}$= 4.9107 and $f_{2}$= 6.4314\,d$^{-1}$.
The third mode with $f_{3}$= 8.0350\,d$^{-1}$ has a much lower amplitude. We
attempt mode identification by examining the amplitude ratios and phase
differences in different wavebands from multicolour photometry and comparing
them to calculations for different spherical harmonic degree, $l$. We find that
the theoretical models for $f_1$ and $f_2$ are in a best agreement with the

$f_3$ is uncertain due to its low amplitude. Non-adiabatic pulsation models
show that frequencies below 6\,d$^{-1}$ are stable, which means that the low

supposed to be both robust and efficient in practice. We introduce the notion

protocol. Our protocol is self-stabilizing for any asynchronous execution. We
prove that its stabilization time for synchronous executions is diam(g)/2 steps

of independent interest. The celebrated mutual exclusion protocol of Dijkstra
stabilizes in n steps (where n is the number of processes) in synchronous
executions and the question whether the stabilization time could be strictly
smaller than the diameter has been open since then (almost 40 years). We show

can now be expressed using a relatively general framework, even though the
different ingredients of the strategy have emerged separately. We rely here on
the micro-macro framework proposed in (Ladev\`eze, Loiseau, and Dureisseix,

(i) the adaptation of the macro-basis to situations where classical
homogenization does not provide a good preconditioner, (ii) the use of
non-linear relocalization to decrease the number of global problems to be
solved in the case of unevenly distributed non-linearities, (iii) the
adaptation of the approximation of the local Schur complement which governs the
convergence of the proposed iterative technique. Computations of delamination

Herschel/HerMES, we study the evolution of the dust attenuation with redshift.
With this information in hand, we are able to estimate the redshift evolution
of the total (FUV + FIR) star formation rate density SFRD_TOT. By integrating
SFRD_TOT, we follow the mass building and analyze the redshift evolution of the
stellar mass density (SMD). This letter aims at providing a complete view of
star formation from the local universe to z = 4 and, using assumptions on
earlier star formation history, compares this evolution to what was known
before in an attempt to draw a homogeneous picture of the global evolution of
star formation in galaxies.
  The main conclusions of this letter are: 1) the dust attenuation A_FUV is
found to increase from z = 0 to z \sim 1.2 and then starts to decrease up to
our last data point at z = 3.6; 2) the estimated SFRD confirms published
results up to z = 2. At z > 2, we observe either a plateau or a small increase
up to z = 3 and then a likely decrease up to z = 3.6; 3) the peak of A_FUV is
delayed with respect to the plateau of SFRD_TOT and a likely origin might be
found in the evolution of the bright ends of the FUV and FIR LFs; 4) using
assumptions (namely exponential rise and linear rise with time) for the
evolution of the star formation density from z = 3.6 to z_form = 10, we
integrate SFRD_TOT and find a good agreement with the published SMDs.

broad-band data from GROND and X-ray observations by Swift/XRT place further
constraints on the amount and nature of dust along the sightline. The galactic
environment of GRB 120815A is characterized by a strong DLA with
log(N(H)/cm^-2) = 21.95 +/- 0.10, prominent H_2 absorption in the Lyman-Werner

log f(H_2)=-1.14 +/- 0.15. The distance d between the absorbing neutral gas and
GRB 120815A is constrained via photo-excitation modeling of fine-structure and
meta-stable transitions of FeII and NiII to d = 0.5 +/- 0.1 kpc. The DLA
metallicity ([Zn/H] = -1.15 +/- 0.12), visual extinction (A_V < 0.15 mag) and
dust depletion ([Zn/Fe] = 1.01 +/- 0.10) are intermediate between the values of
well-studied, H_2-deficient GRB-DLAs observed at high spectral resolution, and
the approximately solar metallicity, highly-obscured and H_2-rich GRB 080607
sightline. With respect to N(H), metallicity, as well as dust-extinction and
depletion, GRB 120815A is fairly representative of the average properties of
GRB-DLAs. This demonstrates that molecular hydrogen is present in at least a
fraction of the more typical GRB-DLAs, and H_2 and H_2^* are probably more
wide-spread among GRB-selected systems than the few examples of previous

decays with invisible neutralinos, which yield distinctive missing energy
events at colliders. Since most LHC searches are designed with this
expectation, the putative bounds on sparticle masses become considerably weaker
if R-parity is violated so that squarks and gluinos decay to jets with large
QCD backgrounds. Here we introduce a scenario in which baryonic R-parity
violation (RPV) arises effectively from soft SUSY-breaking interactions, but
leptonic RPV remains accidentally forbidden to evade constraints from proton
decay and FCNCs. The model features a global R-symmetry that initially forbids
RPV interactions, a hidden R-breaking sector, and a heavy mediator that
communicates this breaking to the visible sector. After R-symmetry breaking,
the mediator is integrated out and an effective RPV A-term arises at tree
level; RPV couplings between quarks and squarks arise only at loop level and
receive additional suppression. Although this mediator must be heavy compared
to soft masses, the model introduces no new hierarchy since viable RPV can
arise when the mediator mass is near the SUSY breaking scale. In generic
regions of parameter space, a light thermally-produced gravitino is stable and
can be a viable dark matter candidate.

electroweak symmetry breaking and dark matter share a common origin, and the
electroweak scale is generated dynamically. Our motivation to suggest this
model is the absense of evidence for new physics from recent LHC data. Although
the conclusion is far from certain at this point, this lack of evidence may
suggest that no mechanism exists at the electroweak scale to stabilise the
Higgs mass against radiative corrections from UV physics. The usual reaction to
this puzzling situation is to conclude that the stabilising new physics is
either hidden from us by accident, or that it appears at energies that are
currently inaccessible, such that nature is indeed fine-tuned. In order to
re-examine the arguments that have lead to this dichotomy, we review the
concept of naturalness in effective field theories, discussing in particular
the role of quadratic divergences in relation to different energy scales. This
leads us to suggest classical scale invariance as a guidline for model
building, implying that explicit mass scales are absent in the underlying
theory.

the resolution at the cloud edge, and to the ray angular resolution. We then
investigate the effect of geometry and simulation parameters on chemical
abundances and find weak dependence on cloud morphology as dictated by gravity
and turbulent Mach number. For a uniform external radiation field, we find
similar distributions to those derived using a one-dimensional PDR code.
However, we demonstrate that a three-dimensional treatment is necessary for a
spatially varying external field, and we caution against using one-dimensional
treatments for non-symmetric problems. We compare our results with the work of

molecule formation in hydrodynamic simulations using a reduced chemical

content, pointing to the existence of a second stellar generation formed from
the ejecta of an earlier generation. The nature of these internal polluters is
still a matter of debate: the two most popular scenarios indicate
intermediate-mass AGB stars and fast rotating massive stars. Abundances
determination for some key elements can help distinguish between these
competitor candidates. We present in this paper Y abundances for a sample of
103 red giant branch stars in NGC 6121. Within measurement errors, we find that
the [Y/Fe] is constant in this cluster contrary to a recent suggestion. For a
subsample of six stars we also find [Rb/Fe] to be constant, consistent with
previous studies showing no variation in other s-process elements. We also
present a new set of stellar yields for intermediate-mass AGB stellar models of
5 and 6 solar masses, including heavy element s-process abundances. The
uncertainties on the mass-loss rate, the mixing-length parameter, and the
nuclear reaction rates have a major impact on the stellar abundances. Within
the IM-AGB pollution scenario, the constant abundance of heavy elements inside
the cluster requires a marginal s-process efficiency in IM-AGB stars. Such a
constrain could still be satisfied by the present models assuming a stronger
mass-loss rate. The uncertainties mentioned above are limiting the predictive
power of intermediate-mass AGB models. For these reasons, at the moment we are
not able to clearly rule out their role as main polluters of the second
population stars in globular clusters.

measurement performed by the ATLAS and CMS experiments. In particular, these
experiments have put many beyond the SM models of natural Electroweak Symmetry
Breaking into tension with the data. It is therefore remarkable that it is
still the LEP experiment, and not the LHC, which often sets the gold standard
for understanding the possibility of new color-neutral states at the
electroweak (EW) scale. Recently, ATLAS and CMS have started to push beyond LEP
in bounding heavy new EW states, but a gap between the exclusions of LEP and
the LHC typically remains. In this paper we show that measurements of SM
Standard Candles can be repurposed to set entirely complementary constraints on
new physics. To demonstrate this, we use WW cross section measurements to set
bounds on a set of slepton-based simplified models which fill in the gaps left
by LEP and dedicated LHC searches. Having demonstrated the sensitivity of the
WW measurement to light sleptons, we also find regions where sleptons can
improve the fit of the data compared to the NLO SM WW prediction alone.
Remarkably, in those regions the sleptons also provide for the right
relic-density of Bino-like Dark Matter and provide an explanation for the
longstanding 3 sigma discrepancy in the measurement of (g-2)_\mu.

the Monge-Kantorovich problem, are known to be a useful tool to investigate
transport equations. In particular, the Benamou-Brenier formula characterizes
the square of the Wasserstein distance $W_2$ as the infimum of the kinetic
energy, or action functional, of all vector fields moving one measure to the
other.
  Another important property of the Wasserstein distances is the
Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality stating the equality between the distance $W_1$
and the supremum of the integrals of Lipschitz continuous functions with
Lipschitz constant bounded by one.
  An intrinsic limitation of Wasserstein distances is the fact that they are
defined only between measures having the same mass. To overcome such
limitation, we recently introduced the generalized Wasserstein distances
$W_p^{a,b}$, defined in terms of both the classical Wasserstein distance $W_p$
and the total variation (or $L^1$) distance. Here $p$ plays the same role as
for the classic Wasserstein distance, while $a$ and $b$ are weights for the
transport and the total variation term.
  In this paper we prove two important properties of the generalized
Wasserstein distances:
  1) a generalized Benamou-Brenier formula providing the equality between
$W_2^{a,b}$ and the supremum of an action functional, which includes a
transport term (kinetic energy) and a source term.

is one of the largest uncertainties in determining the role of galaxies in
cosmic reionization. Yet traditional techniques for measuring this fraction are
inapplicable at the redshifts of interest due to foreground screening by the
Lyman alpha forest. In an earlier study, we demonstrated a reduction in the
equivalent width of low-ionization absorption lines in composite spectra of
Lyman break galaxies at z=4 compared to similar measures at z=3. This might
imply a lower covering fraction of neutral gas and hence an increase with
redshift in the escape fraction of ionizing photons. However, our spectral
resolution was inadequate to differentiate between several alternative
explanations, including changes with redshift in the outflow kinematics. Here
we present higher quality spectra of 3 gravitationally lensed Lyman break
galaxies at z=4 with a spectral resolution sufficient to break this degeneracy
of interpretation. We present a method for deriving the covering fraction of
low-ionization gas as a function of outflow velocity and compare the results
with similar quality data taken for galaxies at lower redshift. We find a
significant trend of lower covering fractions of low-ionization gas for
galaxies with strong \Lya emission. In combination with the demographic trends
of \Lya emission with redshift from our earlier work, our results provide new
evidence for a reduction in the average H I covering fraction, and hence an
increase in the escape fraction of ionizing radiation from Lyman break
galaxies, with redshift.

by using principal component analysis of the post-Newtonian (PN) expansion
coefficients, which is well conditioned despite the Fisher matrix becoming ill
conditioned for larger numbers of parameters. We identify which combinations of
physical parameters are most effectively measured by gravitational-wave
detectors for systems of neutron stars and black holes with aligned spin. We
confirm the expectation that the dominant parameter of the inspiral waveform is
the chirp mass. The next dominant parameter depends on a combination of the
spin and the symmetric mass ratio. In addition, we can study the systematic
effect of various spin contributions to the PN phasing within the same
parametrization, showing that the inclusion of spin-orbit corrections up to
next-to-leading order, but not necessarily of spin-spin contributions, is
crucial for an accurate inspiral waveform model. This understanding of the

the role of modular and spectral functions, from the point of view of the

set of registers that are updated using assignments of the form ""x := y + c"" at
every step. The corresponding class of additive regular functions has multiple
equivalent characterizations, appealing closure properties, and a decidable
equivalence problem. In this paper, we solve two decision problems for this
model. First, we define the register complexity of an additive regular function
to be the minimum number of registers that an ACRA needs to compute it. We
characterize the register complexity by a necessary and sufficient condition
regarding the largest subset of registers whose values can be made far apart
from one another. We then use this condition to design a PSPACE algorithm to
compute the register complexity of a given ACRA, and establish a matching lower
bound. Our results also lead to a machine-independent characterization of the
register complexity of additive regular functions. Second, we consider
two-player games over ACRAs, where the objective of one of the players is to
reach a target set while minimizing the cost. We show the corresponding
decision problem to be EXPTIME-complete when costs are non-negative integers,
but undecidable when costs are integers.

the decays of hadrons (pi->gamma+gamma, eta->gamma+gamma, omega->pi+gamma,
eta'->rho+gamma, phi->eta+gamma, a_1->pi+gamma) as well as their interactions
(pi+pi->rho+gamma, rho+pi->pi+gamma, bremsstrahlung m+m->m+m+gamma). The PHSD
calculations reproduce the transverse momentum spectrum, the effective
temperature T_eff and the elliptic flow v2 of both inclusive and direct photons
as measured by the PHENIX Collaboration. The photons produced in the QGP
contribute slightly less then 50% to the observed spectrum, but have small v2.
We find that the large direct photon v2 - comparable to that of hadrons - can
be attributed to the intermediate hadronic scattering channels not subtracted
from the data when following the same extraction procedure for v2 as in the
PHENIX experiment. On the other hand the v2 of direct photons - as evaluated by
the weighted average of direct photon channels - gives a lower signal. The
difference between the two extraction procedures for the direct photon v2 can
be attributed to different definitions for the yield ratio of direct photons to
the background photons. The QGP phase causes the strong elliptic flow of
photons indirectly, by enhancing the v2 of final hadrons due to the partonic
interaction in terms of explicit parton collisions and the mean-field
potentials. We also show that the presence of the QGP radiation is manifest in
the slope of the direct photon spectrum, leading to a slope parameter T_eff far
above the critical temperature for the deconfinement phase transition.

prerequisite for subcritical transition in shear flows, i.e. transition to

present numerical and analytical computations of linear transient growth
covering all linearly stable regimes of Taylor--Couette flow. Our numerical
experiments reveal comparable energy amplifications in the different regimes.
For high shear Reynolds numbers Re the optimal transient energy growth always
follows a 2/3-scaling with Re, which allows for large amplifications even in
regimes where the presence of turbulence remains debated. In co-rotating
Rayleigh-stable flows the optimal perturbations become increasingly columnar in
their structure, as the optimal axial wavenumber goes to zero. In this limit of
axially invariant perturbations we show that linear stability and transient
growth are independent of the cylinders' rotation-ratio and we derive a
universal 2/3-scaling of optimal energy growth with Re using WKB-theory. Based
on this, a semi-empirical formula for the estimation of linear transient growth
valid in all regimes is obtained.

standard essentially self-adjointness. However, in many examples the spatial

spectrum of curvature perturbations generated during the waterfall, taking into
account the contribution of entropic modes. We focus on the regime of mild
waterfall, in which inflation continues for more than about 60 e-folds N during
the waterfall. We find that the associated f_nl parameter goes typically from
f_nl \simeq -1 / N_exit in the regime with N >> 60, where N_exit is the number
of e-folds between the time of Hubble exit of a pivot scale and the end of
inflation, down to f_nl ~-0.3 when N \gtrsim 60, i.e. much smaller in magnitude
than the current bound from Planck. Considering only the adiabatic
perturbations, the power spectrum is red, with a spectral index n_s = 1 - 4 /
N_exit, in the case N >> 60, whereas in the case N \gtrsim 60, it increases up
to unity. Including the contribution of entropic modes does not change the
observable predictions in the first case. However, in the second case, they are
a relevant source for the power spectrum of curvature perturbations, of which
the amplitude increases by several orders of magnitudes and can lead to black
hole formation. We conclude that due to the important contribution of entropic
modes, the parameter space leading to a mild waterfall phase is excluded by CMB
observations for all the considered models.

may share an arbitrarily large number of finite-dimensional marginals with, or
be arbitrarily close (in Prokhorov or total variation metrics) to, the
data-generating distribution and still make the largest possible prediction
error after conditioning on an arbitrarily large number of samples. The initial
purpose of this paper is to unwrap this brittleness mechanism by providing (i)
a quantitative version of the Brittleness Theorem of \cite{BayesOUQ} and (ii) a
detailed and comprehensive analysis of its application to the revealing example
of estimating the mean of a random variable on the unit interval $[0,1]$ using
priors that exactly capture the distribution of an arbitrarily large number of
Hausdorff moments.
  However, in doing so, we discovered that the free parameter associated with
Markov and Kre\u{\i}n's canonical representations of truncated Hausdorff
moments generates reproducing kernel identities corresponding to reproducing
kernel Hilbert spaces of polynomials.
  Furthermore, these reproducing identities lead to biorthogonal systems of
Selberg integral formulas.
  This process of discovery appears to be generic: whereas Karlin and Shapley
used Selberg's integral formula to first compute the volume of the Hausdorff
moment space (the polytope defined by the first $n$ moments of a probability
measure on the interval $[0,1]$), we observe that the computation of that
volume along with higher order moments of the uniform measure on the moment
space, using different finite-dimensional representations of subsets of the
infinite-dimensional set of probability measures on $[0,1]$ representing the
first $n$ moments, leads to families of equalities corresponding to classical

the form of budget constraints, efficiency maximization has proven to be a
challenging goal. In particular, the social welfare cannot be approximated by a
better factor then the number of players. Therefore, the literature has mainly
resorted to Pareto-efficiency as a way to achieve efficiency in such settings.
While successful in some important scenarios, in many settings it is known that
either exactly one incentive-compatible auction that always outputs a
Pareto-efficient solution, or that no truthful mechanism can always guarantee a
Pareto-efficient outcome. Traditionally, impossibility results can be avoided
by considering approximations. However, Pareto-efficiency is a binary property
(is either satisfied or not), which does not allow for approximations.
  In this paper we propose a new notion of efficiency, called \emph{liquid
welfare}. This is the maximum amount of revenue an omniscient seller would be
able to extract from a certain instance. We explain the intuition behind this
objective function and show that it can be 2-approximated by two different
auctions. Moreover, we show that no truthful algorithm can guarantee an
approximation factor better than 4/3 with respect to the liquid welfare, and
provide a truthful auction that attains this bound in a special case.
  Importantly, the liquid welfare benchmark also overcomes impossibilities for
some settings. While it is impossible to design Pareto-efficient auctions for
multi-unit auctions where players have decreasing marginal values, we give a
deterministic $O(\log n)$-approximation for the liquid welfare in this setting.

non-principal axis rotation state (free precession), called tumbling.
Collisions between asteroids have been proposed as a possible asteroid rotation
excitation mechanism. We simulated subcatastrophic collisions between asteroids
of various physical and material parameters to find out whether they could be
responsible for the excited rotation. For every simulated target body after the
collision, we computed its rotational lightcurve and we found that tumbling was
photometrically detectable for the rotational axis misalignment angle \beta
greater than about 15 deg. We found that subcatastrophic collisions are a
plausible cause of non-principal axis rotation for small slowly rotating
asteroids. The determining parameter is the ratio of the projectile orbital
angular momentum to the target rotational angular momentum and we derived an
approximate relation between this ratio and the angle \beta. We also compared
the limiting energy for the onset of tumbling with the shattering energy.
Slowly rotating asteroids of diameter 100 m and larger can be rotationally
excited by collisions with energies below the shattering limit.

modified Camassa-Holm equation with both quadratic and cubic nonlinearity. This
equation was derived from integrable theory and admits peaked soliton (peakon)
and multipeakon solutions. By constructing two suitable piecewise functions, we
establish the polynomial inequality relating to two conserved quantities and
the maximum of the solution to this equation. The error estimate between the
maximum of the solution and the peakon then follows from the structure of the
polynomial inequality. Finally, we prove that a wave starting close to the
peakon remains close to some translate of it at all later times, that is, the
shapes of these peakons are stable under small perturbations.

for decades. Of particular interest is the influence of disorder on the
superconducting energy gap $\Delta$. In the absence of Coulomb interactions
between electrons, disorder leads to emergent granularity of the local order
parameter resulting in a pseudogap at temperatures above the critical
temperature $T_c$, as well as a finite gap $\Delta$ on the insulating side of
the disorder-driven superconductor-insulator transition (SIT). At the same
time, disorder also enhances the Coulomb interactions, which subsequently may
influence $\Delta$ in a manner that is still not fully understood. Here we
investigate the evolution of the energy gap through the SIT by two different
experimental methods: tunneling spectroscopy, in which a metallic electrode is
placed close to the studied sample thus screening the Coulomb interactions, and
terahertz (THz) spectroscopy, which probes the unscreened sample. The
comparison between the two methods illustrates the role played by electronic
interactions in determining the nature of the phases across the SIT and sheds
light on the mechanisms involved in the destruction of superconductivity.

Pt-porphyrins adsorbed on graphene lead to an enhanced mobility and to
gate-dependent magnetism. We report that porphyrins can be donor or acceptor,
depending on graphene s initial doping. The porphyrins transfer charge and
ionize around the charged impurities on graphene, decreasing the graphene
doping and increasing its mobility. In addition, ionized porphyrins carry a
magnetic moment. Using the sensitivity of mesoscopic transport to magnetism, in
particular the superconducting proximity effect and conductance fluctuations,
we explore the magnetic order induced in graphene by the interacting magnetic
moments of the ionized porphyrins. Among the signatures of magnetism, we find
two-terminal-magnetoresistance fluctuations with an odd component, a tell-tale
sign of time reversal symmetry breaking at zero field, that does not exist in
uncoated graphene sample. When graphene is connected to superconducting
electrodes, the induced magnetism leads to a gate-voltage-dependent suppression
of the supercurrent, modified magnetic interference patterns, and
gate-voltage-dependent magnetic hysteresis. The magnetic signatures are
greatest for long superconductor graphene superconductor junctions and for
samples with the highest initial doping, compatible with a greater number of
ionized and thus magnetic porphyrins. Our findings suggest that long-range
magnetism is induced through graphene by the ionized porphyrins magnetic
moment. This magnetic interaction is controlled by the density of carriers in

the internal chemical enrichment processes, integrated over their entire

nucleosynthesis and dredge-up phenomena.
  We used the UVES spectrograph mounted on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) at
the European Southern Observatory (ESO), to obtain high-resolution spectra with
high signal-to-noise (S/N) of a sample of four post-AGB stars. The objects
display a spectral energy distribution (SED) that indicates the presence of
circumstellar dust.
  All objects are carbon-rich, and strongly enhanced in s-process elements. We
deduced abundances of heavy s-process elements for all stars in the sample, and
even found an indication of the presence of Hg in the spectrum of one object.
The metallicity of all stars except J053253.51-695915.1 is considerably lower
than the average value that is observed for the LMC. The derived luminosities
show that we witness the late evolution of low-mass stars with initial masses
close to 1 solar mass. An exception is J053253.51-695915.1 and we argue that
this object is likely a binary.
  We confirmed the correlation between the efficiency of the third-dredge up
and the neutron exposure that is detected in Galactic post-AGB stars. The
non-existence of a correlation between metallicity and neutron irradiation is
also confirmed and expanded to smaller metallicities. We confirm the status of
21-micron stars as post-Carbon stars. Current theoretical AGB models
overestimate the observed C/O ratios and fail to reproduce the variety of
s-process abundance patterns that is observed in otherwise very similar
objects. Similar results have recently been found for a post-AGB star in the

Strip fields, we have estimated the dependence of the clustering properties of
FIR-selected sources on their 100um fluxes. Our analysis shows a tendency for
the clustering strength to decrease with limiting fluxes: r0(S100um >8 mJy)~4.3
Mpc and r0(S100um >5 mJy)~5.8 Mpc. These values convert into minimum halo
masses Mmin~10^{11.6} Msun for sources brighter than 8 mJy and Mmin~10^{12.4}
Msun for S100um > 5 mJy galaxies. We show such an increase of the clustering
strength to be due to an intervening population of z~2 sources, which are very
strongly clustered and whose relative contribution, equal to about 10% of the
total counts at S100um > 2 mJy, rapidly decreases for brighter flux cuts. By
removing such a contribution, we find that z <~ 1 FIR galaxies have
approximately the same clustering properties, irrespective of their flux level.
The above results were then used to investigate the intrinsic dependence on
cosmic epoch of the clustering strength of dusty star-forming galaxies between
z~0 and z~2.5. In order to remove any bias in the selection process, the
adopted sample only includes galaxies observed at the same rest-frame
wavelength, lambda~60 um, which have comparable luminosities and therefore
star-formation rates (SFR>~100 Msun/yr). Our analysis shows that the same
amount of (intense) star forming activity takes place in extremely different
environments at the different cosmological epochs. For z<~1 the hosts of such
star forming systems are small, Mmin~10^{11} Msun, isolated galaxies. High
(z~2) redshift star formation instead seems to uniquely take place in extremely
massive/cluster-like halos, Mmin~10^{13.5} Msun, which are associated with the
highest peaks of the density fluctuation field at those epochs. (abridged)

< M < 7.5Msun, followed from the pre-main-sequence through the asymptotic giant
branch phase. The metallicity adopted is $Z=3*10^{-4} (which, with an
alpha-enhancement of +0.4, corresponds to [Fe/H]=-2). Dust formation is
described by following the growth of dust grains of various types as the wind
expands from the stellar surface.
  Models with mass M>3Msun experience Hot Bottom Burning, thus maintaining the
surface C/O below unity. Unlike higher Z models, the scarcity of silicon
available in the envelope prevents the formation of silicates in meaningful
quantities, sufficient to trigger the acceleration of the wind via radiation
pressure on the dust grains formed. No silicate formation occurs below a
threshold metallicity of Z=10^{-3}.
  Low--mass stars, with M< 2.5Msun become carbon stars, forming solid carbon
dust in their surroundings. The total dust mass formed depends on the uncertain
extent of the inwards penetration of the convective envelope during the Third
Dredge--Up episodes following the Thermal Pulses. Carbon grains have sizes 0.08
micron < a_C < 0.12 micron and the total amount of dust formed (increasing with
the mass of the star) is M_C=(2-6)*10^{-4}Msun.
  Our results imply that AGB stars with Z=3*10^{-4} can only contribute to
carbon dust enrichment of the interstellar medium on relatively long
timescales, > 300 Myr, comparable to the evolutionary time of a 3Msun star. At
lower metallicities the scarcity of silicon available and the presence of Hot
Bottom Burning even in M< 2Msun, prevents the formation of silicate and carbon
grains. We extrapolate our conclusion to more metal--poor environments, and
deduce that at Z < 10^{-4} dust enrichment is mostly due to metal condensation
in supernova ejecta.

periodic variation in the saturation magnetization along the waveguide. As a
consequence, the spin-wave transmission spectrum exhibits a set of frequency
bands, where spin-wave propagation is suppressed. A weak modification of the
saturation magnetization by 7% is sufficient to decrease the spin-wave
transmission in the band gaps by a factor of 10. These results evidence the
applicability of localized ion implantation for the fabrication of efficient
micron- and nano-sized magnonic crystals for magnon spintronic applications.

  Physics",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Numerical solution of equations governing time domain simulations in
computational electromagnetics, is usually based on grid methods in space and
on explicit schemes for the time evolution. A predefined grid in the problem
domain and a stability step size restriction must be accepted. Evidence is
given that efforts need for overcoming these heavy constraints. Recently, the
authors developed a meshless method to avoid the connective laws among the
points scattered in the problem domain. Despite the good spatial properties,
the numerical explicit integration used in the original formulation of the
method provides,also in a meshless context, spatial and time discretization
strictly interleaved and mutually conditioned. Afterwards, in this paper the
stability condition is firstly addressed in a general way by allowing the time
step increment get away from the minimum points spacing. Meanwhile, a
formulation of the alternating direction implicit scheme for the evolution in
time is combined with the meshless solver. The formulation preserves the
leapfrog marching on in time of the explicit integration scheme. The new
method, not constrained by a gridding in space and unconditionally stable in
time, is numerical assessed by different numerical simulations. Perfect
matching layer technique is used in simulating open spatial problems;
otherwise, a consistency restoring approach is introduced in treating
truncation at finite boundary and irregular points distribution. Three case
studies are investigated by achieving a satisfactory agreement comparing both
numerical and analytical results.

adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code RAMSES. The multi-group radiative transfer
(RT) is performed on the AMR grid with a first-order Godunov method using the
M1 closure for the Eddington tensor, and is coupled to the hydrodynamics via
non-equilibrium thermochemistry of hydrogen and helium. This moment-based
approach has the large advantage that the computational cost is independent of
the number of radiative sources - it can even deal with continuous regions of
emission such as bound-free emission from gas. As it is built directly into
RAMSES, the RT takes natural advantage of the refinement and parallelization
strategies already in place. Since we use an explicit advection solver for the
radiative transport, the time step is restricted by the speed of light - a
severe limitation that can be alleviated using the so--called ""reduced speed of
light"" approximation. We propose a rigorous framework to assess the validity of
this approximation in various conditions encountered in cosmology and galaxy
formation. We finally perform with our newly developed code a complete suite of
RHD tests, comparing our results to other RHD codes. The tests demonstrate that
our code performs very well and is ideally suited for exploring the effect of
radiation on current scenarios of structure and galaxy formation.

Accepted for Reversible Computation 2013",,,,"math.CT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper investigates some issues arising in categorical models of
reversible logic and computation. Our claim is that the structural (coherence)
isomorphisms of these categorical models, although generally overlooked, have
decidedly non-trivial computational content. The theory of categorical
coherence is based around reversible structural operations (canonical
isomorphisms) that allow for transformations between related, but distinct,
mathematical structures. A number of coherence theorems are commonly used to
treat these transformations as though they are identity maps, from which point
onwards they play no part in computational models. We simply wish to point out
that doing so overlooks some significant computational content.
  We give a single example (taken from an uncountably infinite set of similar
examples, and based on structures used in models of reversible logic and
computation) of a category whose structural isomorphisms manipulate modulo
classes of natural numbers. We demonstrate that the coherence properties that
usually allow us to ignore these structural isomorphisms in fact correspond to
countably infinite families of non-trivial identities in modular arithmetic.
Further, proving the correctness of these equalities without recourse to the
theory of categorical coherence appears to be a hard task.

then, by measuring the spatial magnetic field distribution it is possible to

well as the electric conductivity - as functions of temperature $T$ within the
Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) off-shell transport approach. Dynamical
hadronic and partonic systems in equilibrium are studied by the PHSD
simulations in a finite box with periodic boundary conditions. The ratio of the
shear viscosity to entropy density $\eta(T)/s(T)$ from PHSD shows a minimum
(with a value of about 0.1) close to the critical temperature $T_c$. For
$T<T_c$, i.e. in the hadronic phase, the ratio $\eta/s$ rises fast with
decreasing temperature due to a lower interaction rate of the hadronic system
and a significantly smaller number of degrees-of-freedom. The bulk viscosity
$\zeta(T)$ -- evaluated in the relaxation time approach -- is found to strongly
depend on the effects of mean fields (or potentials) in the partonic phase. We
find a significant rise of the ratio $\zeta(T)/s(T)$ in the vicinity of the
critical temperature $T_c$, when consistently including the scalar mean-field
from PHSD, which is also in agreement with that from lQCD calculations.
Furthermore, we present the results for the ratio $(\eta+3\zeta/4)/s$, which is
found to depend non-trivially on temperature and to generally agree with the
lQCD calculations as well. Within the PHSD calculations, the strong maximum of
$\zeta(T)/\eta(T)$ close to $T_c$ has to be attributed to mean-fields (or
potential) effects that in PHSD are encoded in the temperature dependence of
the quasiparticle masses, which is related to the infrared enhancement of the
resummed (effective) coupling $g(T)$. We also find that the dimensionless ratio
of the electric conductivity over temperature $\sigma_0/T$ rises above $T_c$
approximately linearly with $T$ up to $T=2.5 T_c$, but approaches a constant
above $5 T_c$, as expected qualitatively from perturbative QCD (pQCD).

derived from simultaneous optical-to-X-ray data obtained with XMM-Newton shows
the AGN has a typical Eddington ratio (L/L_Edd = 0.014-0.11). The X-ray
spectrum and rapid variability are consistent with originating from a corona
surrounding a standard accretion disc. Partial covering models can describe the
x-ray data; however, the narrow Fe Ka emission line predicted from standard
photoelectric absorption is not detected. Ionized partial covering also favours
a high-velocity outflow (v ~ 0.3c), which requires the kinetic luminosity of
the wind to be >30 per cent of the bolometric luminosity of the AGN. Such
values are not unusual, but for 1ES 1927+654 it requires the wind is launched
very close to the black hole (~ 10 Rg). Blurred reflection models also work
well at describing the spectral and timing properties of 1ES 1927+654 if the

that the mass of the central black hole (M_BH) tightly correlates with the

of this M_BH - sigma scaling relation is assumed to lie in the merging history
of the galaxies but many open questions about its origin and the behavior in
different mass ranges still need to be addressed. The goal of this work is to
study the black-hole scaling relations for low black-hole masses, where the
regime of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) in globular clusters (GCs) is
entered. We collect all existing reports of dynamical black-hole measurements
in globular clusters, providing black-hole masses or upper limits for 14
candidates. We plot the black-hole masses versus different cluster parameters
including total mass, velocity dispersion, concentration and half-mass radius.
We search for trends and test the correlations in order to quantify their
significance using a set of different statistical approaches. For correlations
showing a large significance we perform a linear fit, accounting for
uncertainties and upper limits. We find a clear correlation between the mass of
the IMBH and the velocity dispersion of the globular cluster. As expected, the
total mass of the globular cluster then also correlates with the mass of the
IMBH. While the slope of the M_BH - sigma correlation differs strongly from the
one observed for SMBHs, the other scaling relations M_BH - M_TOT, and M_BH - L
are similar to the correlations in galaxies. Significant correlations of
black-hole mass with other cluster properties were not found in the present
sample.

previous stages of evolution. However, population synthesis calculations are
unable to reproduce the magnetic white dwarf (MWD) sample without binary
interaction or inclusion of a population of progenitor with unobservable
small-scale fields. One necessary ingredient in population synthesis is the
initial-to-final-mass relation (IFMR) which describes the mass-loss processes
during the stellar evolution. When white dwarfs are members of open clusters,
their evolutionary histories can be assessed through the use of cluster
properties. In this work, we assess the cluster membership by correlating the
proper-motion of MWDs with the cluster proper-motion and by analyzing the
candidates spectroscopically with our magnetic model spectra in order to
estimate the effective temperature and radii. We identified SDSS
J085523.87+164059.0 to be a proper-motion member of Praesepe. We also included
the data of the formerly identified cluster members NGC 6819-8, WD 0836+201 and
estimated the mass, cooling age and the progenitor masses of the three probable
MWD members of open clusters. According to our analysis, the newly identified
cluster member SDSS J085523.87+164059.0 is an ultra-massive MWD of mass 1.12
$\pm$ 0.11 Msolar. We increase the sample of MWDs with known progenitor masses
to ten, with the rest of the data coming from the common proper motion
binaries. Our investigations show that, when effects of the magnetic fields are
included in the diagnostics, the estimated properties of these cluster MWDs do
not show evidence for deviations from the IFMR. Furthermore, we estimate the
precision of the magnetic diagnostics which would be necessary to determine
quantitatively whether magnetism has any effect on the mass-loss.

that the [3.4] - [4.6] colour has weak dependence on host stellar age, but
strong dependence on AGN activity. We then use a ""pair-matching"" technique to
subtract the host 4.6 micron contribution. By combining Seyferts with a sample

with substantial scatter. We also compare the partition functions of the total

sub-population of LINERs with significant nuclear 4.6 micron emission, as
function of a variety of host galaxy properties, finding that they are
identical. We conclude, therefore, that [OIII] as an AGN indicator shows no
particular biases as compared to the 4.6 micron luminosity. Our results also
demonstrate that some LINERs do fit in with the expectations of the simple
Unified Model.

polytopes, point configurations and oriented matroids with extremal
combinatorial properties.
  The first part of the thesis explores construction techniques for neighborly
polytopes and oriented matroids. First, we provide a new interpretation of
Shemer's classical Sewing Construction for neighborly polytopes in terms of
lexicographic extensions of oriented matroids. This allows us to provide a
simplified proof and to generalize it to oriented matroids in two ways: the
Extended Sewing Construction and the Gale Sewing Construction. Estimating the
number of polytopes constructed with the later, we can provide new lower bounds
for the number of combinatorial types of neighborly polytopes that even improve
the current best bounds for the number of polytopes. The combination of both
new techniques also allows us to construct many non-realizable neighborly
oriented matroids.
  The degree of a point configuration is the maximal codimension of its
interior faces. The second part of the thesis presents various results on the
combinatorial structure of point configurations whose degree is small compared
to their dimension; specifically, those whose degree is smaller than [(d+1)/2],
the degree of neighborly polytopes. The study of this problem comes motivated
by Ehrhart theory, where a notion equivalent to the degree - for lattice
polytopes - has been widely studied during the last years. In addition, the
study of the degree is also related to the Generalized Lower Bound Theorem for
simplicial polytopes, with Cayley polytopes and with Tverberg theory. Among
other results, we present a complete combinatorial classification for point
configurations of degree 1. Moreover, we show combinatorial restrictions for
configurations of small degree in terms of the novel concepts of weak Cayley
configurations and codegree decompositions.

discrete trees. For a ball of radius $n$ centered at the root, we prove that,
although the size of the boundary is of order $n$, most of the harmonic measure
is supported on a boundary set of size approximately equal to $n^{\beta}$,
where $\beta\approx0.78$ is a universal constant. To derive such results, we
interpret harmonic measure as the exit distribution of the ball by simple
random walk on the tree, and we first deal with the case of critical
Galton-Watson trees conditioned to have height greater than $n$. An important
ingredient of our approach is the analogous continuous model (related to
Aldous' continuum random tree), where the dimension of harmonic measure of a
level set of the tree is equal to $\beta$, whereas the dimension of the level
set itself is equal to $1$. The constant $\beta$ is expressed in terms of the
asymptotic distribution of the conductance of large critical Galton-Watson
trees.

semiconducting charge-qubits confined in a microwave resonator. The qubits are
defined in terms of the charge states of two spatially separated double quantum
dots (DQDs) which are coupled to the same photon mode in the microwave
resonator. We analyze a transport setup where each DQD is attached to
electronic reservoirs and biased out-of-equilibrium by a large voltage, and
study how electron transport across each DQD is modified by the coupling to the
common resonator. In particular, we show that the inelastic current through
each DQD reflects an indirect qubit-qubit interaction mediated by off-resonant
photons in the microwave resonator. As a result of this interaction, both
charge qubits stay entangled in the steady (dissipative) state. Finite shot
noise cross-correlations between currents across distant DQDs are another
manifestation of this nontrivial steady-state entanglement.

responses our understanding of these processes at cellular level remained at
infancy. We develop and solve a coarse grained kinetic network model to
quantify the effects of variation of vitamin D on human immunity. The system of
equations accounts for known inter-relation between active and inactive vitamin
D, antigen presenting cells, effector T cells, regulatory T cells and pathogen.
Both time dependent and steady state solutions are obtained. The time dependent
solution of the system of equations reveals that the immune response is rather
strongly regulated in presence of vitamin D. We found quantitatively that lower
than optimum levels of concentration of active vitamin D correspond to weak
regulation where, once a pathogen/antigen enters the body, the nature of the
immune response would be less regulatory and hence more aggressive, or
inflammatory. The steady state solution of our model shows that vitamin D
enhances the tolerance level of immune system, thereby increasing resistance to
autoimmune diseases. Our model and accompanied numerical analyses reveal
another important aspect of immunity: While extremely low levels of vitamin D
could lead to increased risk of autoimmune responses, an overdose (toxic) level
would give rise to too large a tolerant response, leading to the increased risk
of tumors and cancerous cell growth.

for iterated, two-player games. ZD strategies allow a player to unilaterally
enforce a linear relationship between her score and her opponent's score, and
thus achieve an unusual degree of control over both players' long-term payoffs.
Although originally conceived in the context of classical, two-player game
theory, ZD strategies also have consequences in evolving populations of
players. Here we explore the evolutionary prospects for ZD strategies in the
Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD). Several recent studies have focused on the
evolution of ""extortion strategies"" - a subset of zero-determinant strategies -
and found them to be unsuccessful in populations. Nevertheless, we identify a
different subset of ZD strategies, called ""generous ZD strategies"", that
forgive defecting opponents, but nonetheless dominate in evolving populations.
For all but the smallest population sizes, generous ZD strategies are not only
robust to being replaced by other strategies, but they also can selectively
replace any non-cooperative ZD strategy. Generous strategies can be generalized
beyond the space of ZD strategies, and they remain robust to invasion. When
evolution occurs on the full set of all IPD strategies, selection
disproportionately favors these generous strategies. In some regimes, generous
strategies outperform even the most successful of the well-known Iterated
Prisoner's Dilemma strategies, including win-stay-lose-shift.

Gonczarowski","Satisfiability and Canonisation of Timely Constraints","Based upon Chapter 5 of arXiv:1206.2032",,,,"math.CO cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We abstractly formulate an analytic problem that arises naturally in the
study of coordination in multi-agent systems. Let I be a set of arbitrary
cardinality (the set of actions) and assume that for each pair of distinct
actions (i,j), we are given a number \delta(i,j). We say that a function t,
specifying a time for each action, satisfies the timely constraint {\delta} if
for every pair of distinct actions (i,j), we have t(j)-t(i) <= \delta(i,j) (and
thus also t(j)-t(i) >= -\delta(j,i)). While the approach that first comes to
mind for analysing these definitions is an analytic/geometric one, it turns out
that graph-theoretic tools yield powerful results when applied to these
definitions. Using such tools, we characterise the set of satisfiable timely
constraints, and reduce the problem of satisfiability of a timely constraint to
the all-pairs shortest-path problem, and for finite I, furthermore to the
negative-cycle detection problem. Moreover, we constructively show that every
satisfiable timely constraint has a minimal satisfying function - a key
milestone on the way to optimally solving a large class of coordination
problems - and reduce the problem of finding this minimal satisfying function,
as well as the problems of classifying and comparing timely constraints, to the
all-pairs shortest-path problem. At the heart of our analysis lies the
constructive definition of a ""nicely-behaved"" representative for each class of
timely constraints sharing the same set of satisfying functions. We show that
this canonical representative, as well as the map from such canonical
representatives to the the sets of functions satisfying the classes of timely
constraints they represent, has many desired properties, which provide deep
insights into the structure underlying the above definitions.

attention for various purposes, including the development of novel computing

networks of optical energy transfers between quantum nanostructures mediated by
optical near-field interactions occurring at scales far below the wavelength of
light could be utilized for solving a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP),
the satisfiability problem (SAT), and a decision making problem. The optical
energy transfer from smaller quantum dots to larger ones, which is a quantum
stochastic process, depends on the existence of resonant energy levels between
the quantum dots or a state-filling effect occurring at the larger quantum
dots. Such a spatiotemporal mechanism yields different evolutions of energy
transfer patterns in multi-quantum-dot systems. We numerically demonstrate that
networks of optical energy transfers can be used for solution searching and
decision making. We consider that such an approach paves the way to a novel
physical informatics in which both coherent and dissipative processes are
exploited, with low energy consumption.

partially degradable (PD) quantum channels to answer the question of additivity
of quantum capacity for a well-separable subset of non-degradable channels. A
quantum channel is partially degradable if the channel output can be used to
simulate the degraded environment state. PD channels could exist both in the
degradable, non-degradable and conjugate degradable family. We define the term
partial simulation, which is a clear benefit that arises from the structure of
the complementary channel of a PD channel. We prove that the quantum capacity
of an arbitrary dimensional PD channel is additive. We also demonstrate that
better quantum data rates can be achieved over a PD channel in comparison to

to plasmonic structures for the development of resonant optics functionality
such as metamaterials. Nonspherical like rectangular structures are of most
interest from the standpoint of device development due to fabrication
convenience. However, no intuitive fundamental understanding of optical
resonance in nonspherical structures is available, which has substantially
delayed the device development with dielectric materials. Here we elucidate the
general fundamentals of optical resonances in nonspherical subwavelength
dielectric structures of different shapes (rectangular or triangular) and
dimensionalities (1D nanowires and 0D nanoparticles). We demonstrate that the
optical properties (i.e. light absorption) of nonspherical structures are
dictated by the eigenvalue of the structure's leaky modes. Leaky modes are
defined as natural optical modes with propagating waves outside the structure.
We also elucidate the dependence of the eigenvalue on physical features of the
structures. The eigenvalue shows scaling invariance with the overall size,
weakly relies on the refractive index, but linearly depends on the size ratio
of different sizes of the structure. We propose a modified Fabry-Perot model to
account for this linear dependence. Knowledge of the dominant role of leaky
modes and the dependence of leaky mode on physical features can serve as a
powerful guide for the rational design of devices with desired optical
resonances. It opens up a pathway to design devices with functionality that has
not been explored due to lack of intuitive understanding, for instance, imaging
devices able to sense incident angle, or superabsorbing photodetectors.

cable theory for membranes embedded in arbitrarily complex extracellular media.
We outline the generalized cable equations, then consider specific cases. The
simplest case is a resistive medium, in which case the equations recover the
traditional cable equations. We show that for more complex media, for example
in the presence of ionic diffusion, the impact on cable properties such as
voltage attenuation can be significant. We illustrate this numerically always
by comparing the generalized cable to the traditional cable. We conclude that
the nature of intracellular and extracellular media may have a strong influence

waveforms in the context of EMRI parameter estimation with LISA. Expressions
for the time domain waveforms TaylorT1, TaylorT2, TaylorT3, TaylorT4 and
TaylorEt are derived up to 22PN order, i.e $\mathcal{O}(v^{44})$ ($v$ is the
characteristic velocity of the binary) beyond the Newtonian term, for a test
particle in a circular orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole. The phase
difference between the above 22PN waveform families and numerical waveforms are
evaluated during two-year inspirals for two prototypical EMRI systems with mass
ratios $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-5}$. We find that the dephases (in radians) for
TaylorT1 and TaylorT2, respectively, are about $10^{-9}$ ($10^{-2}$) and
$10^{-9}$ ($10^{-3}$) for mass ratio $10^{-4}$ ($10^{-5}$). This suggests that
using 22PN TaylorT1 or TaylorT2 waveforms for parameter estimation of EMRIs
will result in accuracies comparable to numerical waveform accuracy for most of
the LISA parameter space. On the other hand, from the dephase results, we find
that TaylorT3, TaylorT4 and TaylorEt fare relatively poorly as one approaches
the last stable orbit. This implies that, as for comparable mass binaries using
the 3.5PN phase of waveforms, the 22PN TaylorT3 and TaylorEt approximants do
not perform well enough for the EMRIs. The reason underlying the poor

  This paper aims at correcting that efficiency loss through the use of a
one-dimensional incentive signal, interpreted as a price. While the so-called
Pigovian taxes allow to deal with homogeneous users, we consider here two
classes with different sensitivities to the Quality of Service, reflecting the
dichotomy between delay-sensitive and delay-insensitive applications. We
consider a geographic area covered by two wireless networks, among which users
choose based on a trade-off between the quality of service and the price to

  Using a non-atomic routing game model, we study analytically the case of
constant demand levels. We show that when properly designed, the incentives
elicit efficient user-network associations. Moreover, those optimal incentives
can be simply computed by the wireless operator, using only some information
that is easily available. Finally, the performance of the incentive scheme
under dynamic demand (users opening and closing connections over time) are
investigated through simulations, our incentive scheme also yielding
significant improvements in that case.

an $M\times N$ random matrix with independent entries $x_{ij},1\leq i\leq

show that when $\Sigma$ is spiked with a fixed number of subcritical spikes,
the type 1 Tracy-Widom limit $\mathrm{TW}_1$ holds for the normalized largest
eigenvalue of $\mathcal {W}_N$, which extends a result of F\'{e}ral and

illustrative descriptions of the developments in materials discoveries in which
the author was involved. A summary is given for possible ways to confirm the
topological nature in a candidate material. Various synthesis techniques as
well as the defect chemistry that are important for realizing bulk-insulating
samples are discussed. Characteristic properties of topological insulators are
discussed with an emphasis on transport properties. In particular, the Dirac
fermion physics and the resulting peculiar quantum oscillation patterns are
discussed in detail. It is emphasized that proper analyses of quantum
oscillations make it possible to unambiguously identify surface Dirac fermions
through transport measurements. The prospects of topological insulator
materials for elucidating novel quantum phenomena that await discovery conclude
the review.

relays on the degrees of freedom (DoF) of the X channel and the interference
channel when the transmitters are blind in the sense that no ISIT is available.
In particular, it is shown that adding relay nodes with global CSI to the
communication model is sufficient to recover the DoF that is the optimal for
these models with global CSI at the transmitters. The relay nodes in essence
help steer the directions of the transmitted signals to facilitate interference
alignment to achieve the optimal DoF with CSIT. The general MxN X channel with
relays and the K-user interference channel are both investigated, and
sufficient conditions on the number of antennas at the relays and the number of
relays needed to achieve the optimal DoF with CSIT are established. Using
relays, the optimal DoF can be achieved in finite channel uses. The DoF for the
case when relays only have delayed CSI is also investigated, and it is shown
that with delayed CSI at the relay the optimal DoF with full CSIT cannot be
achieved. Special cases of the X channel and interference channel are
investigated to obtain further design insights.

popularity of its neighbors.
  We prove that the second degrees also obey a power law. More precisely, we
estimate the expectation of the number of vertices with the second degree
greater than or equal to k and prove the concentration of this random variable
around its expectation using the now-famous Talagrand's concentration

with the PACS instrument on board the Herschel Space Observatory and continuum
data at 1.2 mm with the IRAM 30m telescope. The SED and line fluxes were
modelled using the physico-chemo radiative transfer code ProDiMo. We detected a
strong emission by OI at 63 microns using the Herschel Space Observatory. The
[OI] emission at 145 microns, the [CII] emission at 158 microns, the high-J CO
emissions, and the warm water emissions were not detected. Continuum emission
was detected at 1.2 mm. The continuum from the near- to the far-infrared and
the [OI] emission are well explained by the emission from a compact hydrostatic
disc model with a gas mass of 5E-6 MSun, 100 times that of the solid mass.
However, this model fails to match the continuum millimeter flux, which hints
at a cold outer disc with a mass in solids of 1E-6 MSun or free-free emission
from a photoevaporative disc wind. This outer disc can either be devoid of gas
and/or is to cold to emit in the [OI] line. A very flat extended disc model
(Rout=400 AU) with a fixed vertical structure and dust settling matches all
photometric points and most of the [O I] flux. The observations can be
explained by an extended flat disc where dust grains have settled. However, a
flat gas disc cannot be reproduced by hydrostatic disc models. The low mass of
the 51 Oph inner disc in gas and dust may be explained either by the fast
dissipation of an initial massive disc or by a very small initial disc mass.

from any initial state) and it tolerates $f$ Byzantine failures (nodes that
send arbitrary misinformation). Prior algorithms are expensive to implement in
hardware: they require a source of random bits or a large number of states.
  This work consists of two parts. In the first part, we use computational
techniques (often known as synthesis) to construct very compact deterministic
algorithms for the first non-trivial case of $f = 1$. While no algorithm exists
for $n < 4$, we show that as few as 3 states per node are sufficient for all

  In the second part, we develop and compare two different approaches for
synthesising synchronous counting algorithms. Both approaches are based on
casting the synthesis problem as a propositional satisfiability (SAT) problem
and employing modern SAT-solvers. The difference lies in how to solve the SAT
problem: either in a direct fashion, or incrementally within a counter-example
guided abstraction refinement loop. Empirical results suggest that the former
technique is more efficient if we want to synthesise time-optimal algorithms,

small number of free parameters and the successful electroweak symmetry

to reduce energy consumption of sensor nodes to prolong lifetime of
finite-capacity batteries. In this paper, we propose Energy-efficient Adaptive
Scheme for Transmission (EAST) in WSNs. EAST is an IEEE 802.15.4 standard
compliant. In this scheme, open-loop is used for temperature-aware link quality
estimation and compensation. Whereas, closed-loop feedback process helps to
divide network into three logical regions to minimize overhead of control
packets. Threshold on transmitter power loss (RSSIloss) and current number of
nodes (nc(t)) in each region help to adapt transmit power level (Plevel)
according to link quality changes due to temperature variation. Evaluation of
propose scheme is done by considering mobile sensor nodes and reference node
both static and mobile. Simulation results show that propose scheme effectively
adapts transmission Plevel to changing link quality with less control packets
overhead and energy consumption as compared to classical approach with single
region in which maximum transmitter Plevel assigned to compensate temperature
variation.

we consider two categories of setoids with equality on objects and show that

proof-irrelevant family $F$ of setoids. The objects of the categories are the
index setoid $I$ of the family, whereas the definition of arrows differs. The
first category has for arrows triples $(a,b,f:F(a) \to F(b))$ where $f$ is an
extensional function. Two such arrows are identified if appropriate composition
with transportation maps (given by $F$) makes them equal. In the second
category the arrows are triples $(a,b,R \hookrightarrow \Sigma(I,F)^2)$ where
$R$ is a total functional relation between the subobjects $F(a), F(b)

profile and the amplitude of the solar cycle have large variations. Some
precursors of the solar cycle were identified aiming to predict the solar
cycle. The polar field and the geomagnetic index are two precursors which are
received the most attention. The geomagnetic variations during the solar minima
are potentially caused by the solar polar field by the connection of the solar
open flux. The robust prediction skill of the polar field indicates that the
memory of the dynamo process is less than 11 yrs within the framework of the
Babcock-Leighton flux transport dynamo. One possible reason to get the short
magnetic memory is the high magnetic diffusivity in the convective zone. Our
recent studies show that the radial downward pumping is another possible
reason. Based upon the mechanism, we well simulate the cycle irregularities
during RGO time period. This opens the possibility to set up a standard dynamo
based model to predict the solar cycle. In the end, the no correlation between
the polar field and the preceding cycle strength due to the nonlinearities and
random mechanisms involved in the sunspot emergences are stressed.

  Our framework utilizes proactive data services as well as smart content

place during the off-peak hours based on a statistical prediction of a demand
profile for each user, whereas smart content recommendation assigns modified
valuations to data items so as to render the users' demand less uncertain.
Hence, our recommendation scheme aims to boost the performance of proactive

problem of finding an induced Eulerian subgraph with exactly k vertices is
known to be W[1]-hard. The complexity of the problem changes drastically on
directed graphs. On directed graphs we obtained the following complexity
dichotomy: Large Euler Subgraph is NP-hard for every fixed k>3 and is solvable
in polynomial time for k<=3. For Long Circuit, we prove that the problem is FPT
on directed and undirected graphs.

  Model under Uncertainty",,,,,"stat.ME math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper develops maximum score estimation of preference parameters in the
binary choice model under uncertainty in which the decision rule is affected by
conditional expectations. The preference parameters are estimated in two
stages: we estimate conditional expectations nonparametrically in the first
stage and then the preference parameters in the second stage based on Manski
(1975, 1985)'s maximum score estimator using the choice data and first stage
estimates. The paper establishes consistency and derives rate of convergence of
the two-stage maximum score estimator. Moreover, the paper also provides
sufficient conditions under which the two-stage estimator is asymptotically
equivalent in distribution to the corresponding single-stage estimator that
assumes the first stage input is known. These results are of independent
interest for maximum score estimation with nonparametrically generated
regressors. The paper also presents some Monte Carlo simulation results for
finite-sample behavior of the two-stage estimator.

observed $Z_{c}(3900)$ as a $S$-wave $\bar{D}D^{*}$ molecular state. To ensure
the quality of QCD sum rule analysis, contributions of up to dimension nine are
calculated to test the convergence of operator product expansion (OPE). We find
that the two-quark condensate $<\bar{q}q>$ is very large and makes the standard
OPE convergence (i.e. the perturbative at least larger than each condensate
contribution) happen at very large values of Borel parameters. By releasing the
rigid OPE convergence criterion, one could find that the OPE convergence is
still under control. We arrive at the numerical result $3.86\pm0.27 {GeV}$ for
$\bar{D}D^{*}$, which agrees with the mass of $Z_{c}(3900)$ and could support
the explanation of $Z_{c}(3900)$ in terms of a $S$-wave $\bar{D}D^{*}$
molecular state.

above a fixed wall are analysed. In the classical Bodew\""adt problem, where the
swirl tends towards an aysmptotic value away from the wall, the well-known
""tea-cup effect"" drives a flow away from the plate at the centre of the vortex.
Simple dimensional arguments applied to a single vortex show that if the
intensity of the swirl decreases away from the wall, the sense of the
recirculation can be inverted, and that the associated flow rate scales with
the swirl gradient. Only if the flow is quasi-2D, does the classical tea-cup
effect take place. This basic theory is confirmed by numerical simulations of a
square array of steady, electrically driven vortices. Experiments in the
turbulent regimes of the same configuration reveal that these mechanisms are
active in the average flow and in its fluctuating part. The mechanisms singled
out in this letter provide an explanation for previously observed phenomena in
electrolyte flows. They also put forward a possible mechanism for the
generation of helicity in flows close to two-dimensionality, which plays a key
role in the transition between 2D and 3D turbulence.

problem is that the license and the content can get separated and lose track of
each other. The best metadata have two distinct qualities--they are created
automatically without user intervention, and they are embedded within the data
that they describe. If licenses are also created and transported this way, data
will always have licenses, and the licenses will be readily examinable. When
two or more datasets are combined, a new dataset, and with it a new license,
are created. This new license is a function of the licenses of the component
datasets and any additional conditions that the person combining the datasets
might want to impose. Following the notion of a data-purpose algebra, we model
this phenomenon by interpreting the transfer and conjunction of data as
inducing an algebraic operation on the corresponding licenses. When a dataset
passes from one source to the next its license is transformed in a
deterministic way, and similarly when datasets are combined the associated
licenses are combined in a non-trivial algebraic manner. Modern,
computer-savvy, licensing regimes such as Creative Commons allow writing the
license in a special kind of language called Creative Commons Rights Expression
Language (ccREL). ccREL allows creating and embedding the license using RDFa
utilizing XHTML. This is preferred over DRM which includes the rights in a
binary file completely opaque to nearly all users. The colocation of metadata
with human-visible XHTML makes the license more transparent. In this paper we
describe a methodology for creating and embedding licenses in geographic data

sensitivity of a biological system to a given drug. We describe a novel method
called rapid quantitative pharmacodynamic imaging. This method combines
pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling, repeated small doses of a challenge
drug over a short time scale, and functional imaging to rapidly provide
quantitative estimates of drug sensitivity including EC50 (the concentration of
drug that produces half the maximum possible effect). We first test the method
with simulated data, assuming a typical sigmoidal dose-response curve and
assuming imperfect imaging that includes artifactual baseline signal drift and
random error. With these few assumptions, rapid quantitative pharmacodynamic
imaging reliably estimates EC50 from the simulated data, except when noise
overwhelms the drug effect or when the effect occurs only at high doses. In
preliminary fMRI studies of primate brain using a dopamine agonist, the
observed noise level is modest compared with observed drug effects, and a
quantitative EC50 can be obtained from some regional time-signal curves. Taken
together, these results suggest that research and clinical applications for
rapid quantitative pharmacodynamic imaging are realistic.

the usual distribution-free and distribution-dependent bounds for the

Bubeck [2009] and Russo and Roy [2013] we first show that Thompson Sampling
attains an optimal prior-free bound in the sense that for any prior
distribution its Bayesian regret is bounded from above by $14 \sqrt{n K}$. This
result is unimprovable in the sense that there exists a prior distribution such
that any algorithm has a Bayesian regret bounded from below by $\frac{1}{20}
\sqrt{n K}$. We also study the case of priors for the setting of Bubeck et al.
[2013] (where the optimal mean is known as well as a lower bound on the
smallest gap) and we show that in this case the regret of Thompson Sampling is
in fact uniformly bounded over time, thus showing that Thompson Sampling can
greatly take advantage of the nice properties of these priors.

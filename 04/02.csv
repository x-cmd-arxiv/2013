  JAPAN). 8 pages & 9 figures",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The thermal-to-nonthermal partition was found to vary greatly from one flare
to another resulting in a broad variety of cases from 'heating without
acceleration' to 'acceleration without heating'. Recent analysis of microwave
data of these differing cases suggests that a similar acceleration mechanism,
forming a power-law nonthermal tail up to a few MeV or even higher, operates in
all the cases. However, the level of this nonthermal spectrum compared to the
original thermal distribution differs significantly from one case to another,
implying a highly different thermal-to-nonthermal energy partition in various
cases. This further requires a specific mechanism capable of extracting the
charged particles from the thermal pool and supplying them to a bulk
acceleration process to operate in flares \textit{in addition} to the bulk
acceleration process itself, which, in contrast, efficiently accelerates the
seed particles, while cannot accelerate the thermal particles. Within this
'microwave' view on the flare energy partition and particle acceleration I
present a few contrasting examples of acceleration regions detected with
microwave data and compare them with the most popular acceleration
mechanisms---in DC fields, in collapsing traps, and stochastic acceleration by
a turbulence spectrum - to identify the key elements needed to conform with
observations. In particular, I point out that the turbulence needed to drive
the particle acceleration is generated in nonpotential magnetic structures,
which results in nonzero helicity of the turbulence. This helicity, in its
turn, produces a nonzero mean DC electric field on top of stochastic turbulent
fields driving the main stochastic acceleration; thus, acceleration by helical
turbulence combines properties of the standard stochastic acceleration with
some features of acceleration in DC electric fields, exactly what is demanded
by observation.

help of local Berry phases defined by imposing a twist on one or a few local
bonds. In gapped systems with time reversal symmetry, these Berry phases are
quantized, hence able in principle to characterize different phases. In the
case of a fully frustrated ladder where the total spin on a rung is a conserved
quantity that changes abruptly upon increasing the rung coupling, we show that
two Berry phases are relevant to detect such phase transitions: the rung Berry
phase defined by imposing a twist on one rung coupling, and the twist Berry
phase defined by twisting the boundary conditions along the legs. In the case
of non-frustrated ladders, we have followed the fate of both Berry phases when
interpolating between standard ladders and dimerized spin chains. A careful
investigation of the spin gap and of edge states shows that a change of twist
Berry phase is associated to a quantum phase transition at which the bulk gap
closes, and at which, with appropriate boundary conditions, edge states appear
or disappear, while a change of rung Berry phase is not necessarily associated
to a quantum phase transition. The difference is particularly acute for regular
ladders, in which the twist Berry phase does not change at all upon increasing
the rung coupling from zero to infinity while the rung Berry phase changes 2S
times. By analogy with the fully frustrated ladder, these changes are
interpreted as cross-overs between domains in which the rungs are in different
states of total spin from 0 in the strong rung limit to 2S in the weak rung
limit. This interpretation is further supported by the observation that these
cross-overs turn into real phase transitions as a function of rung coupling if
one rung is strongly ferromagnetic, or equivalently if one rung is replaced by
a spin 2S impurity.

J0025-10 is an analogue of local luminous LIRGs and ULIRGs. On the other hand,
the clear evidence for an ongoing major merger of two gas rich progenitors, the
high L(IR) dominated by a starburst, the massive reservoir of molecular gas
with a large fraction still unsettled, and the quasar activity are all
properties consistent with a transition phase in the (U)LIRG-optical QSO
evolutionary scenario. We propose that we are observing the system during a
particular transient phase, prior to more advanced mergers where the nuclei
have already coalesced.
  We argue that a fraction of the molecular gas reservoir is associated with a

accreting source, plus a soft X-ray excess, likely to be of diffuse nature. The
hard X-ray flux increased to maximum in a few weeks and decreased over a year,
with the evolution expected for a tidal disruption event. The fast variations
observed near the flare maximum allowed us to estimate the mass of the central

an effective potential that allows no phase transition. We show that by proving
convexity of the effective potential that governs deep infrared field
fluctuations both at the origin as well as at arbitrary values of the field.
Next, we present numerical plots of the scalar field probability distribution
function (PDF) and the corresponding effective potential for several values of
the coupling constant at the asymptotic future timelike infinity of de Sitter.
For small field values the effective potential has an approximately quadratic
form, corresponding to a positive mass term, such that the corresponding PDF is
approximately Gaussian. However, the curvature of the effective potential shows
qualitatively different (typically much softer) behavior on the coupling
constant than that implied by the Starobinsky-Yokoyama procedure. For large
field values, the effective potential as expected reduces to the tree level
potential plus a positive correction that only weakly (logarithmically) depends
on the background field. Finally, we calculate the backreaction of fluctuations

hydrogen accreted by white dwarfs (WDs) from their low-mass main-sequence or
red-giant binary companions. Chemical composition analysis of their ejecta
shows that nova outbursts occur on both carbon-oxygen (CO) and more massive
oxygen-neon (ONe) WDs, and that there is cross-boundary mixing between the
accreted envelope and underlying WD. We demonstrate that the state-of-the-art
stellar evolution code MESA and post-processing nucleosynthesis tools of NuGrid
can successfully be used for modeling of CO and ONe nova outbursts and
nucleosynthesis. The convective boundary mixing (CBM) in our 1D numerical
simulations is implemented using a diffusion coefficient that is exponentially
decreasing with a distance below the bottom of the convective envelope. We show
that this prescription produces maximum temperature evolution profiles and
nucleosynthesis yields in good agreement with those obtained using the commonly
adopted 1D nova model in which the CBM is mimicked by assuming that the
accreted envelope has been pre-mixed with WD's material. In a previous paper,
we have found that 3He can be produced in situ in solar-composition envelopes
accreted with slow rates (dM/dt < 1e-10 M_sun/yr) by cold (T_WD < 1d7 K) CO
WDs, and that convection is triggered by 3He burning before the nova outburst
in this case. Here, we confirm this result for ONe novae. Additionally, we find
that the interplay between the 3He production and destruction in the
solar-composition envelope accreted with an intermediate rate, e.g. dM/dt =
1e-10 M_sun/yr, by the 1.15 M_sun ONe WD with a relatively high initial central
temperature, e.g. T_WD = 15e6 K, leads to the formation of a thick radiative
buffer zone that separates the bottom of the convective envelope from the WD

fibers (MMFs). Current MMF standards, such as OM3 and OM4, use fibers with core
radii of 50 \mu m, allowing hundreds of modes to propagate. Unfortunately, due
to physical and computational complexity limitations, we cannot couple and
detect hundreds of data streams into and out of the fiber. In order to
circumvent this issue, we present input-output coupling schemes that allow the
user to couple and extract a reasonable number of signals from a fiber with
many modes. This approach is particularly attractive as it is scalable; i.e.,
the fibers do not have to be replaced every time the number of transmitters or
receivers is increased, a phenomenon that is likely to happen in the near
future.
  We present a statistical channel model that incorporates intermodal
dispersion, chromatic dispersion, mode dependent losses, mode coupling, and
input-output coupling. We show that the statistics of the fiber's frequency
response are independent of frequency. This simplifies the computation of the
average Shannon capacity of the fiber. We also provide an input-output coupling
strategy that leads to an increase in the overall capacity. This strategy can
be used whenever channel state information (CSI) is available at the
transmitter. We show that the capacity of an Nt by Nt MIMO system over a fiber
with M>>Nt modes can approach the capacity of an Nt-mode fiber with no
mode-dependent losses. We finally present a statistical input-output coupling
model in order to quantify the loss in capacity when CSI is not available at
the transmitter. It turns out that the loss, relative to Nt-mode fibers, is
minimal (less than 0.5 dB) for a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs)

gravitational lenses. For low values of the characteristic convergence
($\kappa_s \ll 1$) of this model - corresponding to galaxy and galaxy group
mass scales - a high numerical precision is required in order to accurately
compute several quantities in the strong lensing regime. An alternative for
fast and accurate computations is to derive analytic approximations in this
limit. In this work we obtain analytic solutions for several lensing quantities
for elliptical (ENFW) and pseudo-elliptical (PNFW) NFW lens models on the
typical scales where gravitational arcs are expected to be formed, in the
$\kappa_s \ll 1$ limit, establishing their domain of validity. We derive
analytic solutions for the convergence and shear for these models, obtaining
explicit expressions for the iso-convergence contours and constant distortion
curves (including the tangential critical curve). We also compute the
deformation cross section, which is given in closed form for the circular NFW
model and in terms of a one-dimensional integral for the elliptical ones. In
addition, we provide a simple expression for the ellipticity of the
iso-convergence contours of the pseudo-elliptical models and the connection of
characteristic convergences among the PNFW and ENFW models. We conclude that
the set of solutions derived here is generally accurate for $\kappa_s \lesssim
0.1$. For low ellipticities, values up to $\kappa_s \simeq 0.18$ are allowed.
On the other hand, the mapping between PNFW and the ENFW models is valid up to
$\kappa_s \simeq 0.4$. The solutions derived in this work can be used to speed
up numerical codes and ensure their accuracy in the low $\kappa_s$ regime,
including applications to arc statistics and other strong lensing observables.

consist of Dirac cones at non-time-reversal-invariant momenta, similar to

The distribution of separations for Class 0 protostellar binary systems shows a
general trend in which companion star fraction increases with decreasing

measurement is based on cross-correlating the positions of about one million
foreground galaxies at z ~ 0.1 and the flux decrements induced in the spectra
of about 10^5 background quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. This
technique allows us to trace the total amount of Ca II absorption induced by
the circumgalactic medium, including absorbers too weak to be detected in
individual spectra. We can statistically measure Ca II rest equivalent widths
down to several mA, corresponding to column densities of about 5x10^10 cm^{-2}.
We find that the Ca II column density distribution follows N ~ rp^{-1.4} and
the mean Ca II mass in the halo within 200 kpc is ~ 5x10^3 Msolar, averaged
over the foreground galaxy sample with median mass ~ 10^10.3 Msolar. This is
about an order-of-magnitude larger than the Ca II mass in the interstellar
medium of the Milky Way, suggesting more than 90% of Ca II in the Universe is
in the circum- and inter-galactic environments. Our measurements indicate that
the amount of Ca II in halos is larger for galaxies with higher stellar mass
and higher star formation rate. For edge-on galaxies we find Ca II to be more
concentrated along the minor axis, i.e. in the polar direction. This suggests
that bipolar outflows induced by star formation must have played a significant
role in producing Ca II in galaxy halos.

molecular clouds and measure their physical properties. The correlations
between the properties of the N11 clouds are in agreement with those found in
earlier studies in the LMC that sample a larger set of clouds and a larger
range of cloud masses. For the N11 molecular clouds, we compare the masses
estimated from the CO luminosity (Xco\Lco), the virial theorem (Mvir) and the
millimeter dust luminosity (L_d). The measured ratios Lco/Mvir and L_d/Mvir
constrain the Xco and K_d (dust emissivity at 1.2 mm per unit gas mass)

the different mass estimates yields a Xco-factor of 8.8x10^20 cm-2/(K km s-1) x
a_vir and a K_d parameter of 1.5x10^-3 cm2/g x a_vir. We compare our N11
results with a similar analysis for molecular clouds in the Gould's Belt. We do
not find in N11 a large discrepancy between the dust mm and virial masses as
reported in earlier studies of molecular clouds in the SMC. The ratio between
L_d and Mvir in N11 is half of that measured for Gould's Belt clouds, which can
be accounted for by a factor of two lower gas-to-dust mass ratio, as the
difference in gas metallicities. If the two samples have similar a_vir values,
this result implies that their dust far-IR properties are also similar.

cores. The mass of most cores is too small for their self gravity to hold them
together. Instead, they are thought to be pressure confined. The observed dense
cores' mass function (CMF) matches well with the initial mass function (IMF) of
stars in young clusters. Similar CMF's are observed in other star forming
regions such as the Aquila Nebula, albeit with some dispersion. The shape of
these CMF provides important clues to the competing physical processes which
lead to star formation and its feedback on the interstellar media. In this
paper, we investigate the dynamical origin of the the mass function of starless
cores which are confined by a warm, less dense medium. We consider the
coagulation between the cold cores and their ablation due to Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability induced by their relative motion through the warm medium. We are
able to reproduce the observed CMF among the starless cores in the Pipe nebula.
Our results indicate that in environment similar to the Pipe nebula: 1) before
the onset of their gravitational collapse, the mass distribution of the
progenitor cores is similar to that of the young stars, 2) the observed CMF is
a robust consequence of dynamical equilibrium between the coagulation and
ablation of cores, and 3) a break in the slope of the CMF is due to the
enhancement of collisional cross section and suppression of ablation for cores
with masses larger than the cores' Bonnor-Ebert mass.

massive, hot, X-ray luminous, and bright Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect cluster at
$z\gtrsim0.6$, and the only `bullet'-like merging cluster known at these
redshifts. The lens consists of two merging massive clumps, where for a source
redshift of $z_{s}\sim2$ each clump exhibits only a small, separate critical
area, with a total area of $0.69\pm0.11\sq\arcmin$ over the two clumps. For a
higher source redshift, $z_{s}\sim4$, the critical curves of the two clumps
merge together into one bigger and very elongated lens (axis ratio
$\simeq5.5$), enclosing an effective area of $1.44\pm0.22\sq\arcmin$. The
critical curves continue expanding with increasing redshift so that for
high-redshift sources ($z_{s}\gtrsim9$) they enclose an area of
$\sim1.91\pm0.30\sq\arcmin$ (effective $\theta_{e}\simeq46.8\pm3.7\arcsec$) and
a mass of $6.09\pm1.04\times10^{14}M_{\odot}$. According to our model, the area
of high magnification ($\mu>10$) for such high redshift sources is
$\simeq1.2\sq\arcmin$, and the area with $\mu>5$ is $\simeq2.3\sq\arcmin$,

a proxy to group total mass, groups have a larger stellar mass content by a
factor 1.3, a relative excess independent of the group luminosity. Groups in
superstructures have 40 per cent higher velocity dispersions and systematically
larger minimal enclosing radii. We also find that the stellar population of
galaxies in groups in superstructures is systematically older as infered from
the galaxy spectra Dn4000 parameter. Although the galaxy number density profile
of groups is independent of environment, the star formation rate and stellar
mass profile of the groups residing in superstructures differs from groups
elsewhere. For groups residing in superstructures, the combination of a larger
stellar mass content and star formation rate produces a larger time scale for
star formation regardless the distance to the group center. Our results provide
evidence that groups in superstructures formed earlier than elsewhere, as

force the eccentricity of this planet to a level affecting the eclipse depth
observed with Spitzer. Using the constant time lag tidal model, we first
calculate the observed planet flux as a function of albedo and eccentricity,
for different tidal dissipation constants and for two extreme cases: a planet
with no heat redistribution and a planet with full heat redistribution. We
derive the values of albedo and eccentricity that match the observed transit
depth. We then perform N-body simulations of the planetary system including
tides and General Relativity to follow the evolution of the eccentricity of
planet e. We compare the range of eccentricities given by the simulations with
the eccentricities required to alter the eclipse depth. We find that the
eccentricity of planet e can be large enough to contribute at a measurable
level to the thermal emission measured with Spitzer. This affects the
constraints on the albedo of the planet, which can be as high as 0.9 (instead
of 0.55 when ignoring tidal heating). We also derive a maximum value for the
eccentricity of planet e directly from the eclipse depth: e<0.015 assuming
Earth's dissipation constant. Transiting exoplanets in multiple planet systems
are exceptional targets for testing tidal models because their tidal luminosity
may be observable. Future multi-wavelengths observations of eclipse depth and
phase curves (for instance with EChO and JWST) should allow us to better
resolve the temperature map of these planets and break the degeneracy between
albedo and tidal heating that remains for single band observations. In
addition, an accurate determination of the eccentricity will make it possible
to constrain the dissipation rate of the planet and to probe its internal

a sufficiently flat region. To give all inflatons large masses after inflation
and yield a small but positive cosmological constant, the trajectory in field
space needs to terminate in a hole on the inflationary plateau, introducing a
curved end-of-inflation hypersurface. We compute non-Gaussianities (bi- and

potentially large, local non-linearity parameter. To be consistent with current
observational bounds, the hole needs to be shallow, i.e. considerably wider

chain complex. The homotopy type of the type A structure is a tangle invariant,
and homotopy equivalences of the type A structure result in chain homotopy
equivalences on the Khovanov chain complex. We can use this to simplify
computations and introduce a modular approach to the computation of Khovanov
homologies. This approach adds to the literature even in the case of a connect
sum, where the techniques here will allow an exact computation of Khovanov
homology from the structures for two tangles coming from the summands. Several
examples are included, showing in particular how we can compute the correct
torsion summands for the Khovanov homology of the connect sum. A lengthy
appendix is devoted to establishing the theory of these structures over a
characterstic zero ring.

invariant QCD for massive fermions suggests the existence of indefinite metric
associated to quark states, a property that might relate it with the known
Lee-Wick theories. Thus, the nature of the asymptotic free quark states in the
theory is investigated here by quantizing the quadratic part of the quark
action. As opposite to the case in the standard QCD, the free theory does not
show Hamiltonian constraints. The propagation modes include a family of
massless waves and a complementary set of massive oscillations. The theory can
be quantized in a way that the massive modes show positive metric and the
massless ones exhibit negative norms. It is remarked that, since QCD is
expected to not exhibit gluon or quark asymptotic states, the presence of
negative metric massless modes does not constitute a definite drawback of the
theory. In addition, the fact that the positive metric quark states are
massive, seems to be a good feature of the model, being consistent with the
approximate existence of asymptotically free massive states in high energy
processes.

at $Re=5000$ using statistics conditioned on the enstrophy. The data is
obtained by direct numerical simulation and threshold values span 24 orders of
magnitude, ranging from essentially irrotational fluid outside the jet to fully
turbulent fluid in the jet core. We use two independent estimators for the
local entrainment velocity $v_n$ based on the enstrophy budget. The data show
clear evidence for the existence of a viscous superlayer (VSL) that envelopes
the turbulence. The VSL is a nearly one-dimensional layer with low surface
curvature. We find that both its area and viscous transport velocity adjust to
the imposed rate so that the integral entrainment flux is independent of
threshold, although low-Reynolds-number effects play a role for the case under
consideration. This threshold independence is consistent with the inviscid
nature of the integral rate of entrainment. A theoretical model of the VSL is
developed that is in reasonably good agreement with the data and predicts that
the contribution of viscous transport and dissipation to interface propagation
have magnitude $2 v_n$ and $-v_n$, respectively. We further identify a
turbulent core region (TC) which is a region that shrinks over time and a
buffer region connecting the VSL and the TC that grows in time and where the
inviscid enstrophy production is important. The BR shows many similarities with
the turbulent-nonturbulent interface (TNTI), although the TNTI seems to extend
into the TC. The average distance between the TC and the VSL, i.e.\ the BR
thickness is about 10 Kolmogorov length scales or half a Taylor length scale,
indicating that intense turbulent flow regions and viscosity-dominated regions
are in close proximity.

multiple stellar populations in recently formed extragalactic star clusters.
All of the Galactic globular clusters for which good samples of individual
stellar abundances are available show evidence for multiple populations. This
appears to require that multiple episodes of star formation and light element
enrichment are the norm in the history of a globular cluster. We show that
there are detectable observational signatures of multiple formation events in
the unresolved spectra of massive, young extragalactic star clusters. We
present the results of a pilot program to search for one of the cleanest
signatures that we identify - the combined presence of emission lines from a
very recently formed population and absorption lines from a somewhat older
population. A possible example of such a system is identified in the Antennae
galaxies. This source's spectrum shows evidence of two stellar populations with
ages of 8 Myr and 80 Myr. Further investigation shows that these populations
are in fact physically separated, but only by a projected distance of 59 pc. We
show that the clusters are consistent with being bound and discuss the
possibility that their coalescence could result in a single globular cluster
hosting multiple stellar populations. While not the prototypical system
proposed by most theories of the formation of multiple populations in clusters,
the detection of this system in a small sample is both encouraging and
interesting. Our investigation suggests that expanded surveys of massive young
star clusters should detect more clusters with such signatures.

reported to lead to a loss of innate, hard-wired fear toward cats, its primary

underlying mechanism for this pathogen mediated behavioral change remain
unknown. To begin exploring these questions, we evaluated the effects of
infection with two previously uninvestigated isolates from the three major
North American clonal lineages of T. gondii, Type III and an attenuated strain
of Type I. Using an hour-long open field activity assay optimized for this

show that loss of innate aversion of cat urine is a general trait caused by
infection with any of the three major clonal lineages of parasite.
Surprisingly, we found that infection with the attenuated Type I parasite
results in sustained loss of aversion at times post infection when neither
parasite nor ongoing brain inflammation were detectable. This suggests that T.
gondii-mediated interruption of mouse innate aversion toward cat urine may
occur during early acute infection in a permanent manner, not requiring
persistence of parasitecysts or continuing brain inflammation.

principal finding is that it can be decomposed into communities of densely

on the intuition that community structure is best defined in terms of a

result suggests a mapping between communities in structural networks, models of

premium principle in actuarial applications. However, an insurance company,
applying the net-premium principle, goes bankrupt with probability one in the
long run, even if the company covers its entire costs by collecting the
respective fees from its customers. It is therefore an intrinsic necessity for
the insurance industry to apply premium principles, which guarantee at least
further existence of the company itself; otherwise, the company naturally could
not insure its clients to cover their potential, future claims. Beside this
intriguing fact the underlying loss distribution typically is not known
precisely. Hence alternative premium principles have been developed. A simple
principle, ensuring risk-adjusted credibility premiums, is the distorted
premium principle. This principle is convenient in insurance companies, as the
actuary does not have to change his or her tools to compute the premiums or
reserves. This paper addresses the distorted premium principle from various
angles. First, dual characterizations are developed. Next, distorted premiums
are typically computed by under-weighting or ignoring low, but over-weighting
high losses. It is demonstrated here that there is an alternative, opposite
point of view, which consists in leaving the probability measure unchanged, but
increasing the outcomes instead. It turns out that this new point of view is
natural in actuarial practice, as it can be used for premium calculations, as
well as to determine the reserves of subsequent years in a time consistent way.

paraxial approximation is extended to the context of two wave theories. The
first theory is the so-called Thermal Wave Model (TWM) that interprets the
paraxial thermal spreading of the beam particles as the analog of the quantum
diffraction. The other theory, hereafter called Quantum Wave Model (QWM), that
takes into account the individual quantum nature of the single beam particle
(uncertainty principle and spin) and provides the collective description of the
beam transport in the presence of the quantum paraxial diffraction. QWM can be
applied to beams that are sufficiently cold to allow the particles to manifest
their individual quantum nature but sufficiently warm to make overlapping-less
the single-particle wave functions. In both theories, the propagation of the
beam transport in plasmas or in vacuo is provided by fully similar set of
nonlinear and nonlocal governing equations, where in the case of TWM the
Compton wavelength (fundamental emittance) is replaced by the beam thermal
emittance. In both models, the beam transport in the presence of the
self-fields (space charge and inductive effects) is governed by a suitable
nonlinear nonlocal 2D Schroedinger equation that is used to obtain the envelope
beam equation in quantum and quantum-like regimes, respectively. An envelope
equation is derived for both TWM and QWM regimes. In TWM we recover the well
known Sacherer equation whilst, in QWM we obtain the evolution equation of the
single-particle spot size, i.e., single quantum ray spot in the transverse
plane (Compton regime). We show that such a quantum evolution equation contains
the same information carried out by an evolution equation for the beam spot
size (description of the beam as a whole). This is done by defining the lowest
QWM state reachable by a system of overlapping-less Fermions.

simulations use the observed masses, positions and spectral classes of targeted

constant cruise speed, and only changes direction from gravitational deflection

choices -- differing the maximum cruise speed, number of probes launched,
number of target stars to be explored, and probability of avoiding catastrophic
system failure per parsec -- change the completion time of the exploration
program and the expected number of stars successfully visited. In addition, it
is shown that improving this success probability per parsec has diminishing
returns beyond a certain point. Future improvements to the model and possible

essential. Toward this end, K\""{o}tter and Kschischang propose the use of
subspace codes to provide error correction in the network coding context. The
primary construction for subspace codes is the lifting of rank-metric or matrix
codes, a process that preserves the structural and distance properties of the
underlying code. Thus, to characterize the structure and error-correcting
capability of these subspace codes, it is valuable to perform such a
characterization of the underlying rank-metric and matrix codes. This paper
lays a foundation for this analysis through a framework for classifying
rank-metric and matrix codes based on their structure and distance properties.
  To enable this classification, we extend work by Berger on equivalence for
rank-metric codes to define a notion of equivalence for matrix codes, and we
characterize the group structure of the collection of maps that preserve such
equivalence. We then compare the notions of equivalence for these two related
types of codes and show that matrix equivalence is strictly more general than
rank-metric equivalence. Finally, we characterize the set of equivalence maps
that fix the prominent class of rank-metric codes known as Gabidulin codes. In
particular, we give a complete characterization of the rank-metric automorphism
group of Gabidulin codes, correcting work by Berger, and give a partial
characterization of the matrix-automorphism group of the expanded matrix codes

predicted expected radio fluxes for the two annihilation channels: \chi\chi ->

problem of geodesic ball packings related to those tilings and their symmetry
groups $\mathbf{pq2_1}$. $\SLR$ is one of the eight Thurston geometries that
can be derived from the 3-dimensional Lie group of all $2\times 2$ real
matrices with determinant one.
  In this paper we consider geodesic spheres and balls in $\SLR$ (even in
$\mathbf{SL_{\mathrm{2}}R})$, if their radii $\rho\in [0, \frac{\pi}{2})$, and
determine their volumes. Moreover, we consider the prisms of the above space
and compute their volumes, define the notion of the geodesic ball packing and
its density. We develop a procedure to determine the densities of the densest
geodesic ball packings for the tilings, or in this paper more precisely, for
their generating groups $\mathbf{pq2_1}$ (for integer rotational parameters
$p,q$; $3\le p, \frac{2p}{p-2} <q$). We look for those parameters $p$ and $q$
above, where the packing density large enough as possible. Now our record is
$0.567362$ for $(p, q) = (8, 10)$. These computations seem to be important,
since we do not know optimal ball packing, namely in the hyperbolic space
$\HYP$. We know only the density upper bound 0.85326, realized by horoball
packing of $\HYP$ to its ideal regular simplex tiling. Surprisingly, for the
so-called translation ball packings under the same groups $\mathbf{pq2_1}$ in
\cite{MSzV13} we have got larger density $0.841700$ for $(p, q) = (5, 10000

projective model introduced by the first author in \cite{M97}.

meridional flows under the ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) approximation. As
seen from the stationary condition equations for such bodies, the presence of
the meridional flows and that of the poloidal magnetic fields act oppositely on
the internal structures.
  The different actions of these two physical quantities, the meridional flows
and the poloidal magnetic fields, could be clearly seen through stationary
structures of the toroidal gaseous configurations around central point masses
in the framework of Newtonian gravity because the effects of the two physical
quantities can be seen in an amplified way for toroidal systems compared to
those for spheroidal stars. The meridional flows make the structures more
compact, i.e. the widths of toroids thinner, while the poloidal magnetic fields
are apt to elongate the density contours in a certain direction depending on
the situation. Therefore, the simultaneous presence of the internal flows and
the magnetic fields would work as if there were no such different actions
within and around the stationary gaseous objects such as axisymmetric
magnetized toroids with internal motions around central compact objects under
the ideal MHD approximation, although these two quantities might exist in real
systems.

$\varphi$-currents for magnetized stars to sustain strong toroidal magnetic
fields within the stars by an- alyzing stationary states of magnetized stars
with surface currents which flow in the opposite direction with respect to the
bulk currents within the stars. We have imposed boundary conditions for
currents and toroidal magnetic fields to vanish outside the stars. It is
important to note that these boundary conditions set an upper limit for the
total current within the stars. This upper limit for the total current results
in the presence of an upper limit for the magnitude of the energy for the
toroidal magnetic fields of the stars. If the stars could have the toroidal
surface currents which flow in the opposite directions to the internal toroidal
currents, the positively flowing inter- nal toroidal currents can become
stronger than the upper limit value of the current for configurations without
surface toroidal currents. Thus the energies for the toroidal magnetic fields
can become much larger than those for the magnetized stars with- out surface
toroidal currents. We have also analyzed the same phenomena appearing in
spherical incompressible stars for dipole-like magnetic fields with or without
sur- face toroidal currents by employing the zero-flux-boundary method. We have
applied those configurations with surface toroidal currents to magnetars and
discussed their flares through which magnetic helicities could arise outside

assume that the maximum $S_n^*$ of $S(v)$ over all vertices $v$ at distance $n$
from the root tends to infinity (necessarily, linearly) as $n$ tends to
infinity. We analyze the Metropolis algorithm on the tree and show that under
these assumptions there always exists a temperature $1/\beta$ of the algorithm
so that it achieves a linear (positive) growth rate in linear time. This
confirms a conjecture of Aldous [Algorithmica 22 (1998) 388-412]. The proof is
obtained by establishing an Einstein relation for the Metropolis algorithm on

the linear regime, the transition from the exact to the broken ${\cal
PT}$-phase is determined through the calculation of the eigenfrequency spectrum
for two different configurations; the one with equidistant split-rings and the
other with the split-rings forming a binary pattern (${\cal PT}$ dimer chain).
The latter system features a two-band, gapped spectrum with its shape
determined by the gain/loss coefficient as well as the inter-element coupling.
In the presense of nonlinearity, the ${\cal PT}$ dimer chain with balanced gain
and loss supports nonlinear localized modes in the form of novel discrete
breathers below the lower branch of the linear spectrum. These breathers, that
can be excited from a weak applied magnetic field by frequency chirping, can be
subsequently driven solely by the gain for very long times. The effect of a
small imbalance between gain and loss is also considered. Fundamendal
gain-driven breathers occupy both sites of a dimer, while their energy is
almost equally partitioned between the two split-rings, the one with gain and
the other with loss. We also introduce a model equation for the investigation
of classical ${\cal PT}$ symmetry in zero dimensions, realized by a simple
harmonic oscillator with matched time-dependent gain and loss that exhibits a
transition from oscillatory to diverging motion. This behaviour is similar to a
transition from the exact to the broken ${\cal PT}$ phase in higher-dimensional
${\cal PT}-$ symmetric systems. A stability condition relating the parameters
of the problem is obtained in the case of piecewise constant gain/loss function
that allows for the construction of a phase diagram with alternating stable and
unstable regions.

of FB model and includes in a consistent way a description of inhomogeneous

focusing on the relation between cosmological parameters. The main result is
the consistency of $\Lambda$CDM model values for $\Omega_{\Lambda0}$ ($\approx

voids. This allows to quantify to which extent the inhomogeneous structure

where P is in L, for several known low-complexity matrix algebras L. The
algorithm so obtained is particularly efficient when A is Toeplitz plus Hankel

defined as a pre-exposure covariate C for which there exists a set of other
covariates X such that effect of the exposure on the outcome is unconfounded
conditional on (X,C) but such that for no proper subset of (X,C) is the effect
of the exposure on the outcome unconfounded given the subset. We also provide a
conditional analogue of the above definition; and we propose a variable that
helps reduce bias but not eliminate bias be referred to as a ""surrogate

AU, is about 2.6 times better than provided by LABOCA. We also make use of
Spitzer infrared observations to characterise the star-formation activity in
the source. The source is filamentary and remains a double-core system on the
3400 AU scale probed here, where the projected separation between IRAS 05399
and SMM 1 is 0.14 pc. The broadband spectral energy distribution of IRAS 05399
suggests that it is near the Stage 0/I borderline. A visual inspection of the
Spitzer/IRAC images provides hints of a quadrupolar-like jet morphology around
IRAS 05399, supporting the possibility that it is a binary system. The
temperature map reveals warm spots towards IRAS 05399 and the southeastern tip
of the source. These features are likely to be imprints of protostellar or
shock heating, while external heating could be provided by the nearby high-mass
star-forming region NGC 2024. A simple analysis suggests that the density
profile at the position of SMM 1 has the form ~r^-(2.3_{-0.9}^{+2.2}). The
source splitting into two subcores along the long axis can be explained by
cylindrical Jeans-type fragmentation but the steepness of the density profile
is shallower than what is expected for an isothermal cylinder. The difference
between the evolutionary stages of IRAS 05399 (protostellar) and SMM 1
(starless) suggests that the former has experienced a phase of rapid mass
accretion, supported by the very long outflow it drives. The protostellar jet
from IRAS 05399 might have influenced the nearby core SMM 1.

bridge this gap. It describes 5 heuristics that can be applied to create

literature on the semantics and complexity of evaluating SPARQL queries, which
ensures that queries following these rules can be optimised effectively by an
underlying RDF store. Moreover, we empirically verify the efficacy of the

and manipulate light-matter interaction. Various optical resonators are
designed and fabricated using different techniques. For example, in coupled
resonator optical waveguides, light energy is transported to other resonators
through near-field coupling. In recent years, magnetic optical resonators based
on LC resonance have been realized in several metallic microstructures. Such
devices possess stronger local resonance and lower radiation loss compared with
electric optical resonators. This study provides an overall introduction on the
latest progress in coupled magnetic resonator optical waveguide (CMROW).
Various waveguides composed of different magnetic resonators are presented and
Lagrangian formalism is used to describe the CMROW. Moreover, several
interesting properties of CMROW, such as abnormal dispersions and slow light
effects, are discussed and CMROW applications in nonlinear and quantum optics
are shown. Future novel nanophotonic devices can be developed using CMROW.

particles whose phase behavior was recently studied experimentally [E. K. Riley
and C. M. Liddell, Langmuir, 26, 11648 (2010)]. The geometry of the particles
is characterized by the reduced height \chi^* = \chi/\sigma, such that the
model extrapolates between hard spheres for \chi^* \leftarrow 1 and infinitely
thin hard platelets for \chi^* \letfarrow 0. Three different particle shapes
are investigated: (a) three-quarter height spherical caps (\chi^* = 3/4), (b)
one-half height spherical caps or hemispheres (\chi^* = 1/2), and (c)
one-quarter height spherical caps (\chi^* = 1/4). These three models are used
to rationalize the effect of particle shape, obtained by cutting off spheres at
different heights, on the entropy-driven self-assembly of the particles under
strong confinements; i.e., for 1 < H/\chi < 2.5. As H is varied, a sequence of
crystal structures are observed, including some having similar symmetry as that
of the structures observed in confined hard spheres on account of the remaining
spherical surface in the particles, but with additional features on account of
the particle shapes having intrinsic anisotropy and orientational degrees of
freedom. The \chi^* = 3/4 system is found to exhibit a phase diagram that is
most similar to the one obtained experimentally for the confined mushroom
cap-shaped colloidal particles under. A qualitative global phase diagram is
constructed that helps reveal the interrelations among different phases for all
the particle shapes and confinements studied.

subsumes recent work employing reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, and reveals
many parallels between linear and nonlinear sufficient dimension reduction.
Using these parallels we analyze the properties of existing methods and develop
new ones. We begin by characterizing dimension reduction at the general level
of $\sigma$-fields and proceed to that of classes of functions, leading to the
notions of sufficient, complete and central dimension reduction classes. We
show that, when it exists, the complete and sufficient class coincides with the
central class, and can be unbiasedly and exhaustively estimated by a
generalized sliced inverse regression estimator (GSIR). When completeness does
not hold, this estimator captures only part of the central class. However, in
these cases we show that a generalized sliced average variance estimator
(GSAVE) can capture a larger portion of the class. Both estimators require no
numerical optimization because they can be computed by spectral decomposition
of linear operators. Finally, we compare our estimators with existing methods
by simulation and on actual data sets.

constant specific angular momentum on a fixed space-time background, in case of
perturbation by a matter coming from the outer boundary. Two dimensional
hydrodynamical equations are solved at equatorial plane using the HRSCS to
study the effect of perturbation on the stable systems. We have found that the
perturbed torus creates an instability which causes the gas falling into the
black hole in a certain dynamical time. All the models indicate an oscillating
torus with certain frequency around their instant equilibrium. The dynamic of
the accreted torus varies with the size of initial stable torus, black hole
spin and other variables, such as Mach number, sound speed, cusp location of
the torus, etc. The mass accretion rate is slightly proportional to the
torus-to-hole mass ratio in the black hole-torus system, but it strongly
depends on the cusp location of the torus. The cusp located in the
equipotential surfaces of the effective potential moves outwards into the
torus. The dynamical change of the torus increases the mass accretion rate and
triggers the Papaloizou-Pringle instability. It is also observed that the
growth of the $m=1$ mode of the Papaloizou-Pringle instability occurs for a
wide range of fluid and hydrodynamical parameters and a black hole spin. We

multitude of codes based upon a huge variety of methods and techniques have
been spawned yet the question remained as to whether or not they will provide
the same (physical) information about the structures of interest. Here we
summarize and extent previous work of the ""halo finder comparison project"": we
investigate in detail the (possible) origin of any deviations across finders.
To this extent we decipher and discuss differences in halo finding methods,
clearly separating them from the disparity in definitions of halo properties.
We observe that different codes not only find different numbers of objects
leading to a scatter of up to 20 per cent in the halo mass and Vmax function,
but also that the particulars of those objects that are identified by all
finders differ. The strength of the variation, however, depends on the property
studied, e.g. the scatter in position, bulk velocity, mass, and the peak value
of the rotation curve is practically below a few per cent, whereas derived
quantities such as spin and shape show larger deviations. Our study indicates
that the prime contribution to differences in halo properties across codes
stems from the distinct particle collection methods and -- to a minor extent --
the particular aspects of how the procedure for removing unbound particles is
implemented. We close with a discussion of the relevance and implications of
the scatter across different codes for other fields such as semi-analytical
galaxy formation models, gravitational lensing, and observables in general.

launch of {\it Swift} satellite, is a major obstacle to LGRB studies. Recently,
it is shown that the prompt emission of LGRBs is classified into three
subclasses: Type I, Type II LGRBs populating separate fundamental planes in a
3D space defined by the peak luminosity, the duration, and the spectral peak
energy, and outliers not belonging to either of the planes. Here we show that
Type I LGRBs (LGRBs I) exhibit different shapes of light curves from Type II
LGRBs (LGRBs II). Furthermore, we demonstrate that this classification has
uncovered a new scaling law in the light curves of LGRBs II spanning 8 orders
of magnitude from the prompt to late X-ray afterglow emission. The scaled light
curve has four distinct phases. The first phase has a characteristic time scale
while the subsequent three phases exhibit power law behaviors with different
exponents. We discuss its possible interpretation in terms of the emission from
an optically thick fireball propagating in the cricumstellar matter at
relativistic speeds and argue that the observed four phases correspond to its
hydrodynamical phases. Our classification scheme can pin down the intrinsic
luminosities of LGRBs II through the scaling law from a sample of polymorphic
GRBs. Further refinement of this scheme and scaling law will make a subclass of
LGRBs a standard candle as reliable and accurate as Type Ia supernovae in the
more distant universe than supernovae can reach.

manifold that can be embedded in a Riemannian manifold (Euclidean space) and
will construct a vector field defined on the ambient space whose restriction to
the embedded manifold is the gradient vector field of the lifted cost function.
The advantage of this method is that it allows us to do computations in
Cartesian coordinates instead of using local coordinates and covariant
derivatives on the initial manifold. We will exemplify the algorithm in the
case of SO(3) averaging problems and will rediscover a few well known results

half-duplex causal cognition. This channel model consists of two
source-destination pairs sharing a common wireless channel. One of the sources,
referred to as the cognitive, overhears the other source, referred to as the
primary, through a noisy link and can therefore assist in sending the primary's
data. Due to practical constraints, the cognitive source is assumed to work in
half-duplex mode, that is, it cannot simultaneously transmit and receive. This
model is more relevant for practical cognitive radio systems than the classical
information theoretic cognitive channel model, where the cognitive source is
assumed to have a non-causal knowledge of the primary's message. Different
network topologies are considered, corresponding to different interference
scenarios: (i) the interference-symmetric scenario, where both destinations are
in the coverage area of the two sources and hence experience interference, and
(ii) the interference-asymmetric scenario, where one destination does not
suffer from interference. For each topology the sum-rate performance is studied
by first deriving the generalized Degrees of Freedom (gDoF), or ""sum-capacity
pre-log"" in the high-SNR regime, and then showing relatively simple coding
schemes that achieve a sum-rate upper bound to within a constant number of bits
for any SNR. Finally, the gDoF of the channel is compared to that of the
non-cooperative interference channel and to that of the non-causal cognitive
channel to identify the parameter regimes where half-duplex causal cognition is
useless in practice or attains its ideal ultimate limit, respectively.

For the hadronic model, a temporary equilibrium between particle

to evaluate the radiative output from cascades initiated by internal
gamma-gamma pair production is presented. We use our codes to fit snap-shot
spectral energy distributions of a representative set of Fermi-LAT detected
blazars. We find that the leptonic model provides acceptable fits to the SEDs
of almost all blazars with parameters close to equipartition between the
magnetic field and the relativistic electron population. However, the hard
gamma-ray spectrum of AO 0235+164, in contrast to the very steep IR-optical-UV

in leptonic models is provided by cold protons, the kinetic energy carried by
the jet should be dominated by protons. We find satisfactory representations of
the snapshot SEDs of most blazars in our sample with the hadronic model
presented here. However, in the case of two quasars the characteristic break at
a few GeV energies can not be well modelled. All of our hadronic model fits

the standard flux transport model is insufficient to simultaneously reproduce

career years. For young careers, the model does a much worse job of predicting
future impact, and hence, exposes a serious limitation. The limitation is
particularly concerning as early career decisions make up a significant

derive the expression for the global invasion potential of the epidemic that
depends on disease transmissibility, transportation network and mobility
features, demographic profile and mixing pattern. Highly assortative mixing
favor the spatial containment of the epidemic, this effect being contrasted by
an increase in the social activity of adults vs. children. Heterogeneity of the
mobility network topology and traffic flows strongly favor the disease
invasion, as also a larger fraction of children traveling. Variations in the
demography and mixing habits across countries lead to heterogeneous outbreak
situations. Results are compatible with the H1N1 spatial spread observed. The
work illustrates the importance of age-dependent mixing profiles and mobility
features in the study of the conditions for the spatial invasion of an emerging

to use less expensive optoelectronics and offers backwards compatibility with
legacy Optical Transport Network (OTN) infrastructure. However, optimal
parallel transmission does not scale to large networks, as it requires
computationally expensive multipath routing algorithms to minimize differential
delay, and thus the required buffer size, optimize traffic splitting ratio, and
ensure frame synchronization. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for
high-speed Ethernet, which we refer to as network coded parallel transmission,
capable of effective buffer management and frame synchronization without the
need for complex multipath algorithms in the OTN layer. We show that using
network coding can reduce the delay caused by packet reordering at the
receiver, thus requiring a smaller overall buffer size, while improving the
network throughput. We design the framework in full compliance with high-speed
Ethernet standards specified in IEEE802.3ba and present solutions for network
encoding, data structure of coded parallel transmission, buffer management and
decoding at the receiver side. The proposed network coded parallel transmission
framework is simple to implement and represents a potential major breakthrough
in the system design of future high-speed Ethernet.

T$_e$, sometimes velocities are usually measured. These four quantities and the
gravity constant G are determined by three measurements units: mass M, length L
and time T. Therefore one can form two non-dimensional similarity criteria:
$\Pi_1$ and $\Pi_2$. Any chosen observable can be formed as a function of the
other three ones. The author has at hand the data by Vikhlinin (2002) and
Vikhlinin et al. (2006), rather more complete than any other. This material
consists of more than thirty clusters at 0.4 $\le$ z < 1.26 and z $\le$ 0. This
material gives a possibility to test the derived dimensional relationships and
to determine the dimensionless numerical coefficients at them. These
coefficients are found with a scatter less than 30 per cent in the data above
and could be considered as other similarity criteria but functions of $\Pi_1$
and $\Pi_2$. With this scatter they may be called approximate invariants. The
luminosity L and universal constant G are forming the dynamical velocity scale
U$_d$, which immediately explains the empirical Tully-Fisher law. The
temperature T$_e$ determines the thermal velocity of the gas plasma particles
U$_T$. The ratio U$_d$/ U$_T$= $\Pi_1$ is used here as a new similarity
criterium which is found to be constant within six per cent for nearly 30
objects cited above: $\Pi_1$=0.163$\pm$0.009 and may be interpreted as the Mach
number. The other criterium $\Pi_2 is the virial one. It is found to be a
function of the cluster age. At z>0.5 the mean cluster mass is five times less,
that at small z $\le$0.2. It is demanding to expand these results to other

Different metrics have
been put forward to evaluate scientific development; in this paper we explore a
metric that uses the number of peer-reviewed, and when available
non-peer-reviewed articles, research research articles as an indicator of
development in the field of astronomy. We analyzed the available publication
record, using the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Database System, by country affiliation
in the time span between 1950 and 2011 for countries with a Gross National
Income of less than 14,365 USD in 2010. This represents 149 countries. We
propose that this metric identifies countries in `astronomy development' with a
culture of research publishing. We also propose that for a country to develop
astronomy it should invest in outside expert visits, send their staff abroad to
study and establish a culture of scientific publishing. Furthermore, we propose
that this paper may be used as a baseline to measure the success of major
international projects, such as the International Year of Astronomy 2009.

bubbles in the system by means of a Voronoi-based analysis of the Molecular
Dynamics trajectories. By comparing the features of the tessellation of liquid
water at ambient conditions to those of the same system with an empty cavity we
are able to discriminate vapor (or interfacial) molecules from the bulk ones.
This information is used to follow the time evolution of the largest bubble
until the system cavitates at 280 K above and below the spinodal line. At the
pressure above the spinodal line, the MFPT curve shows the expected shape for a
moderately metastable liquid from which we estimate the bubble nucleation rate
and the size of the critical cluster. The nucleation rate estimated using
Classical Nucleation Theory turns out to be about 8 order of magnitude lower
than the one we compute by means of MFPT. The behavior at the pressure below
the spinodal line, where the liquid is thermodynamically unstable, is
remarkably different, the MFPT curve being a monotonous function without any
inflection point.

largely on the complex that is built on top of the data points. From a
computational viewpoint, the most favored complexes for this purpose have so
far been Vietoris-Rips and witness complexes. While the Vietoris-Rips complex
is simple to compute and is a good vehicle for extracting topology of sampled
spaces, its size is huge--particularly in high dimensions. The witness complex
on the other hand enjoys a smaller size because of a subsampling, but fails to
capture the topology in high dimensions unless imposed with extra structures.
We investigate a complex called the {\em graph induced complex} that, to some
extent, enjoys the advantages of both. It works on a subsample but still
retains the power of capturing the topology as the Vietoris-Rips complex. It
only needs a graph connecting the original sample points from which it builds a
complex on the subsample thus taming the size considerably. We show that, using
the graph induced complex one can (i) infer the one dimensional homology of a
manifold from a very lean subsample, (ii) reconstruct a surface in three
dimension from a sparse subsample without computing Delaunay triangulations,
(iii) infer the persistent homology groups of compact sets from a sufficiently
dense sample. We provide experimental evidences in support of our theory.

contractions have turned to be useful in various applications involving
topology. It was observed previously that contracting edges that satisfy the so
called link condition preserves homeomorphism in low dimensional complexes, and
homotopy in general. But, checking the link condition involves computation in
all dimensions, and hence can be costly, especially in high dimensional
complexes. We define a weaker and more local condition called the p-link
condition for each dimension p, and study its effect on edge contractions. We
prove the following: (i) For homology groups, edges satisfying the p- and
(p-1)-link conditions can be contracted without disturbing the p-dimensional
homology group. (ii) For relative homology groups, the (p-1)-, and the
(p-2)-link conditions suffice to guarantee that the contraction does not
introduce any new class in any of the resulting relative homology groups,
though some of the existing classes can be destroyed. Unfortunately, the
surjection in relative homolgy groups does not guarantee that no new relative
torsion is created. (iii) For torsions, edges satisfying the p-link condition
alone can be contracted without creating any new relative torsion and the
p-link condition cannot be avoided. The results on relative homology and
relative torsion are motivated by recent results on computing optimal
homologous chains, which state that such problems can be solved by linear
programming if the complex has no relative torsion. Edge contractions that do
not introduce new relative torsions, can safely be availed in these contexts.

spatial distribution and kinematics of the ionized and molecular gas are
remarkably similar and are well modeled by a turbulent, globally Toomre

than the clumpy rest-frame UV/optical light distribution, and peaks in an
obscured, star forming massive bulge near the dynamical center. The molecular
gas surface density and the effective optical screen extinction track each
other and are well modeled by a 'mixed' extinction model. The inferred slope of

pure spin currents through a superconductor on a scale comparable to the
superconducting coherence length. As with charge currents, two processes
contribute to the nonlocal spin signal: crossed Andreev reflection (CAR), where
an electron with spin up injected from one normal metal into the superconductor
results in a hole with spin down being injected into the second normal metal,
and elastic cotunneling (EC), where the electron with spin up injected from the
first normal metal results in an electron with spin up being injected into the

associated with CAR and EC add due to the fact that the bulk superconductor

the Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo and KAGRA gravitational-wave detectors over
the next several years, with the intention of providing information to
facilitate planning for multi-messenger astronomy with gravitational waves. We
estimate the sensitivity of the network to transient gravitational-wave signals
for the third (O3), fourth (O4) and fifth observing (O5) runs, including the
planned upgrades of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. We study
the capability of the network to determine the sky location of the source for
gravitational-wave signals from the inspiral of binary systems of compact
objects, that is BNS, NSBH, and BBH systems. The ability to localize the
sources is given as a sky-area probability, luminosity distance, and comoving
volume. The median sky localization area (90\% credible region) is expected to
be a few hundreds of square degrees for all types of binary systems during O3
with the Advanced LIGO and Virgo (HLV) network. The median sky localization
area will improve to a few tens of square degrees during O4 with the Advanced
LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA (HLVK) network. We evaluate sensitivity and localization
expectations for unmodeled signal searches, including the search for
intermediate mass black hole binary mergers.

the U-gamma mixing strength parameter epsilon^2 of 5e-6 at 90% CL was obtained

molecular outflow were studied using new ALMA Cycle 0 observations. Results
show that the blue and red lobes are strikingly different. We argue that these
differences are partly due to contrasting ambient densities that result in
different wind components having a distinct effect on the entrained gas in each
lobe. A 29-point mosaic, covering the two lobes at an angular resolution of
about 3"", detected outflow emission at much higher velocities than previous
observations, resulting in significantly higher estimates of the outflow
momentum and kinetic energy than previous studies of this source, using the
CO(1-0) line. The morphology and the kinematics of the gas in the blue lobe are
consistent with models of outflow entrainment by a wide-angle wind, and a
simple model describes the observed structures in the position-velocity diagram
and the velocity-integrated intensity maps. The red lobe exhibits a more
complex structure, and there is evidence that this lobe is entrained by a
wide-angle wind and a collimated episodic wind. Three major clumps along the
outflow axis show velocity distribution consistent with prompt entrainment by
different bow shocks formed by periodic mass ejection episodes which take place
every few hundred years. Position-velocity cuts perpendicular to the outflow
cavity show gradients where the velocity increases towards the outflow axis,
inconsistent with outflow rotation. Additionally, we find evidence for the
existence of a small outflow driven by a binary companion.

the Universe, dark energy and dark matter, flow with distinct four-velocities.
This cosmological configuration is equivalent to a single anisotropic fluid,
expanding with a four-velocity that is an appropriate combination of the two
fluid four-velocities. The energy density of the single cosmological fluid is
larger than the sum of the energy densities of the two perfect fluids, i.e.,
dark energy and dark matter, respectively, and contains a correction term due
to the anisotropy generated by the differences in the four-velocities.
Furthermore, the gravitational field equations of the two-fluid anisotropic
cosmological model are obtained for a Bianchi type I geometry. By assuming that
the non-comoving motion of the dark energy and dark matter induces small
perturbations in the homogeneous and isotropic
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker type cosmological background, and that the
anisotropy parameter is small, the equations of the cosmological perturbations
due to the non-comoving nature of the two major components are obtained. The
time evolution of the metric perturbations is explicitly obtained for the cases
of the exponential and power law background cosmological expansion. Therefore,
if there is a slight difference between the four-velocities of the dark energy
and dark matter, the Universe would acquire some anisotropic characteristics,
and its geometry will deviate from the standard FLRW one. In fact, the recent
Planck results show that the presence of an intrinsic large scale anisotropy in
the Universe cannot be excluded {\it a priori}, so that the model presented in
this work can be considered as a plausible and viable working hypothesis.

large scales, (structures beyond ~ 100 kpc) WDM and CDM yield identical results
which agree with observations. For intermediate scales, WDM gives the correct
abundance of substructures. Inside galaxy cores, below ~ 100 pc, N-body WDM
classical physics simulations are incorrect because at such scales quantum WDM
effects are important. WDM quantum calculations (Thomas-Fermi approach) provide
galaxy cores, galaxy masses, velocity dispersions and density profiles in
agreement with the observations. For a dark matter particle decoupling at
thermal equilibrium (thermal relic), all evidences point out to a 2 keV
particle. Remarkably enough, sterile neutrinos decouple out of thermal
equilibrium with a primordial power spectrum similar to a 2 keV thermal relic
when the sterile neutrino mass is about 7 keV. Therefore, WDM can be formed by
7 keV sterile neutrinos. Excitingly enough, Bulbul et al. (2014) announced the
detection of a cluster X-ray emission line that could correspond to the decay
of a 7.1 keV sterile neutrino and to a neutrino decay mixing angle of \sin^2 2
\theta ~ 7 10^{-11} . This is a further argument in favour of sterile neutrino
WDM. Baryons, represent 10 % of DM or less in galaxies and are expected to give
a correction to pure WDM results. The detection of the DM particle depends upon
the particle physics model. Sterile neutrinos with keV scale mass (the main WDM
candidate) can be detected in beta decay for Tritium and Renium and in the
electron capture in Holmiun. The sterile neutrino decay into X rays can be
detected observing DM dominated galaxies and through the distortion of the
black-body CMB spectrum. So far, not a single valid objection arose against
WDM.

facilities have, for decades, played a key role in maximizing the scientific
return from their facilities and telescopes. It is crucial to realize that an
""observatory"" is more than simply a telescope or ensemble of telescopes that
provide observing opportunities for astronomers. Observatories are at the heart
of an institutional capability to do things beyond what is possible for
astronomers themselves to do as individuals. Observatories organize and
mobilize a range of multidisciplinary skills for achieving a coherent and
sustainable capability that is central to modern observational astrophysics.
Yet many of the activities and roles carried out by the ""observatory""
organization in fulfillment of their mission are not fully recognized by
policymakers or senior managers, and often not fully understood even within the
astronomy community. As we assess the future opportunities for new facilities
in a challenging budget environment it is important to be cognizant of what
observatories do and the roles they play.

research: (1) Theoretical knowledge is more valuable than practical knowledge;
(2) One cannot generalize from a single case, therefore the single case study
cannot contribute to scientific development; (3) The case study is most useful
for generating hypotheses, while other methods are more suitable for hypotheses
testing and theory building; (4) The case study contains a bias toward
verification; and (5) It is often difficult to summarize specific case studies.
The article explains and corrects these misunderstandings one by one and
concludes with the Kuhnian insight that a scientific discipline without a large
number of thoroughly executed case studies is a discipline without systematic
production of exemplars, and that a discipline without exemplars is an
ineffective one. Social science may be strengthened by the execution of more
good case studies.

This allows us to construct generic off--diagonal solutions depending on all

nice ultraviolet behavior and seem to be (super) renormalizable in a sense of

model various physical phenomena, such as ferromagnetism. For each natural
number $r$, the $r$-neighbour bootstrap process is an update rule for vertices
of a graph in one of two states: `infected' or `healthy'. In consecutive
rounds, each healthy vertex with at least $r$ infected neighbours becomes
itself infected. Percolation is said to occur if every vertex is eventually
infected.
  Usually, the starting set of infected vertices is chosen at random, with all
vertices initially infected independently with probability $p$. In that case,
given a graph $G$ and infection threshold $r$, a quantity of interest is the
critical probability, $p_c(G,r)$, at which percolation becomes likely to occur.
In this paper, we look at infinite trees and, answering a problem posed by
Balogh, Peres and Pete, we show that for any $b \geq r$ and for any $\epsilon >
0$ there exists a tree $T$ with branching number $\br(T) = b$ and critical
probability $p_c(T,r) < \epsilon$. However, this is false if we limit ourselves
to the well-studied family of Galton--Watson trees. We show that for every $r
\geq 2$ there exists a constant $c_r>0$ such that if $T$ is a Galton--Watson
tree with branching number $\br(T) = b \geq r$ then p_c(T,r) > \frac{c_r}{b}
e^{-\frac{b}{r-1}}.
  We also show that this bound is sharp up to a factor of $O(b)$ by giving an
explicit family of Galton--Watson trees with critical probability bounded from
above by $C_r e^{-\frac{b}{r-1}}$ for some constant $C_r>0$.

of the companion, lead to the strong dependence of illumination conditions of
the disk on the azimuth (because of extinction between the star and the disk

nodes. The sizes and locations of the domains are depended on the model
parameters as well as on the phase of the orbital period. The bright and dark

which the interferer tier is not allowed to transmit data. Vulnerable users
thus get a chance to be scheduled in ABSFs with reduced cross-tier
interference. We analyze downlink scenarios using stochastic geometry and
formulate a condition for the required number of ABSFs based on base station
placement statistics and user throughput requirement. The result is a
semi-analytical formula that serves as a good initial estimate and offers an
easy way to analyze impact of network parameters. We show that while in

discrete Laplacian, and $\xi$ plays the role of a \emph{dynamic random

$x\in\Z^d$, is taken to be non-negative and bounded. The solution of the
parabolic Anderson equation describes the evolution of a field of particles
performing independent simple random walks with binary branching: particles
jump at rate $2d\kappa$, split into two at rate $\xi \vee 0$, and die at rate
$(-\xi) \vee 0$. We assume that $\xi$ is stationary and ergodic under

certain mild space-time mixing assumptions the limit exists $\xi$-a.s., is
finite and continuous on $[0,\infty)$, is globally Lipschitz on $(0,\infty)$,
is not Lipschitz at 0, and satisfies $\lambda_0(0) = \E(\xi(0,0))$ and
$\lambda_0(\kappa) > \E(\xi(0,0))$ for $\kappa \in (0,\infty)$.In the present
paper we show that $\lim_{\kappa\to\infty} \lambda_0(\kappa) =\E(\xi(0,0))$
under an additional space-time mixing condition on $\xi$. This result shows
that the parabolic Anderson model exhibits space-time ergodicity in the limit
of large diffusivity. This fact is interesting because there are choices of
$\xi$ that fulfill our assumption for which the annealed Lyapunov exponent
$\lambda_1(\kappa) = \lim_{t\to\infty} \frac{1}{t}\log \E(u(0,t))$ is infinite
on $[0,\infty)$, a situation that is referred to as strongly catalytic

to allow fits to electronic heat capacity versus temperature T data that
deviate from the BCS prediction. The model assumes that the normalized
superconducting order parameter Delta(T)/Delta(0) and therefore the normalized
London penetration depth lambda_L(T)/lambda_L(0) are the same as in BCS theory,
calculated using the BCS value alpha_BCS = 1.764 of alpha = Delta(0)/(kB Tc),
where kB is Boltzmann's constant and Tc is the superconducting transition
temperature. On the other hand, to calculate the electronic free energy,
entropy, heat capacity and thermodynamic critical field versus T, the
alpha-model takes alpha to be an adjustable parameter. Here we write the BCS
equations and limiting behaviors for the superconducting state thermodynamic
properties explicitly in terms of alpha, as needed for calculations within the
alpha-model, and present plots of the results versus T and alpha that are
compared with the respective BCS predictions. Mechanisms such as gap anisotropy
and strong coupling that can cause deviations of the thermodynamics from the

Here we present our methodology with a representative globular cluster NGC
4590. We use HST archival ACS data in the F606W and F814W bands and apply
PSF-fitting photometry to obtain high quality color-magnitude diagrams. We
formulate the star superposition effect as a Poisson probability distribution
function, with parameters optimized through Monte-Carlo simulations. A
model-independent binary fraction of (6.2 +- 0.3)% is obtained by counting
stars that extend to the red side of the residual color distribution after
accounting for the photometric errors and the star superposition effect. A
model-dependent binary fraction is obtained by constructing models with a known
binary fraction and an assumed binary mass-ratio distribution function. This
leads to a binary fraction range of 6.8% to 10.8%, depending on the assumed
shape to the binary mass ratio distribution, with the best fit occurring for a
binary distribution that favors low mass ratios (and higher binary fractions).
We also represent the method for radial analysis of the binary fraction in the

from hospital epidemiology is the incidence of hospital-acquired infection,
which has to account for hospital discharge of non-infected patients as a
competing risk. An illness-death model would allow to further study hospital
outcomes of infected patients. Such a model typically relies on a Markov
assumption. However, it is conceivable that the future course of an infected
patient does not only depend on the time since hospital admission and current
infection status but also on the time since infection. We demonstrate how a
modified competing risks model can be used for nonparametric estimation of
transition probabilities when the Markov assumption is violated.

simplified model of the clarinet driven by a variable control parameter. When
the control parameter is varied the clarinet model undergoes a dynamic
bifurcation. A consequence of this is the phenomenon of bifurcation delay: the
bifurcation point is shifted from the static oscillation threshold to an higher
value called dynamic oscillation threshold. In a previous work [8], the dynamic
oscillation threshold is obtained analytically. In the present article, the
sensitivity of the dynamic threshold on precision is analyzed as a stochastic
variable introduced in the model. A new theoretical expression is given for the
dynamic thresholds in presence of the stochastic variable, providing a fair
prediction of the thresholds found in finite-precision simulations. These
dynamic thresholds are found to depend on the increase rate and are independent
on the initial value of the parameter, both in simulations and in theory.

compact inner component with effective radius Re<1 kpc, an intermediate-scale
middle component with Re~2.5 kpc, and an extended outer envelope with $R_e

hypothetical structure formed from combining the inner plus the middle
components of local ellipticals follows a strikingly tight stellar mass-size
relation, one that resembles the distribution of early-type galaxies at z~1.5.
Outside of the central kpc, the median stellar mass surface density profiles of
this composite structure agree closest with those of massive galaxies that have
similar cumulative number density at 1.5<z<2.0 within the uncertainty. We
propose that the central substructures in nearby ellipticals are the
evolutionary descendants of the ""red nuggets"" formed under highly dissipative

the two-phase formation scenario recently advocated for massive galaxies.
Subsequent accretion, plausibly through dissipationless (""dry"") minor mergers,

using a multi-type Lotka-Volterra framework with cross-infection. Analysis of
similar models have, in the past, assumed simpler interaction structures as a
first step towards tractability. We solve the proposed model, finding trade-off
conditions on the life-history traits of both bacteria and viruses that allow
coexistence in communities with nested infection networks. First, we find that
bacterial growth rate should decrease with increasing defense against
infection. Second, we find that the efficiency of viral infection should
decrease with host range. Next, we establish a relationship between relative
densities and the curvature of life history trade-offs. We compare and contrast
the current findings to the ""Kill-the-Winner"" model of multi-species

propose a reparameterization of the Dirichlet process that induces conditional
independencies between the atoms that form the random measure. This conditional
independence enables many of the Markov chain transition operators for DP
inference to be simulated in parallel across multiple cores. Applied to mixture
modeling, our approach enables the Dirichlet process to simultaneously learn
clusters that describe the data and superclusters that define the granularity
of parallelization. Unlike previous approaches, our technique does not require
alteration of the model and leaves the true posterior distribution invariant.
It also naturally lends itself to a distributed software implementation in
terms of Map-Reduce, which we test in cluster configurations of over 50

to be interpreted as the result of simultaneous action of three kinds of
motion: (1) field aligned flows, (2) swaying motions, and (3) torsional
motions. We use high-quality observations from CRISP at the SST to investigate
signs of these different kinetic modes in spicules on the disk. Earlier, rapid
blue-shifted excursions (RBEs), short-lived absorption features in the blue
wing of chromospheric spectral lines, were identified as the disk counterpart
of type II spicules. Here we report the existence of similar absorption
features in the red wing of the Ca II 8542 and Halpha lines: rapid red-shifted
excursions (RREs). RREs are found over the whole solar disk and are located in
the same regions as RBEs: in the vicinity of magnetic field concentrations.
RREs have similar characteristics as RBEs: they have similar lengths, widths,
lifetimes, and average Doppler velocity. The striking similarity of RREs to
RBEs implies that RREs are a manifestation of the same physical phenomenon and
that spicules harbour motions that can result in a net red-shift when observed
on-disk. We find that RREs are less abundant than RBEs and we interpret the
higher number of RBEs and the decreased imbalance towards the limb as an
indication that field-aligned up-flows have a significant contribution to the
net Dopplershift. Most RREs and RBEs are observed in isolation but we find many
examples of parallel and touching RRE/RBE pairs which appear to be part of the
same spicule. We interpret the existence of these RRE/RBE pairs as signs that
torsional motion is an important characteristic of spicules. The fact that most
RBEs and RREs are observed in isolation agrees with the idea that transversal
swaying motion is another important kinetic mode. We find examples of
transitions from RRE to RBE and vice versa.

transverse momenta of relativistic electrons, which as a result, start to
radiate in the synchrotron regime. On the basis of the Vlasov's kinetic
equation we study the process of the quasi-linear diffusion (QLD) developed by
means of the cyclotron instability. This mechanism provides generation of
optical and X-ray emission on the light cylinder lengthscales. The analysis of

instability and mass loss, but the mechanism responsible for these episodes has
not been identified. We study one potential contributor: the development of
local radiation-driven instabilities in the outer layers of main sequence (MS)
and post-MS massive stars. We construct a sequence of massive stellar evolution
models and investigate where they are subject to local radiative instabilities,
both in the presence of magnetic fields and without them,and at a range of
metallicities. We find that these types of instabilities do not occur in
solar-metallicity MS stars up to 100\,M$_\odot$, but they set in immediately
post-MS for stars heavier than $\sim 25$\,M$_\odot$. Once an instability
appears, it involves a significant amount of mass in the star's upper layers
(up to $\sim 1$ per cent of the initial stellar mass), suggesting that
radiation-driven instabilities are a potentially viable mechanism for dynamic
mass loss. We find that the presence of magnetic fields at strengths low enough
not to disturb the hydrostatic balance of the star does not alter these
results. Stars with sub-Solar metallicity also show instability, but their
instabilities involve less mass and appear later in the star's evolution.

backreaction effects due to small scale inhomogeneities in general relativity.
We considered one-parameter families of spacetimes for which such backreaction
effects can occur, and we proved that, provided the weak energy condition on
matter is satisfied, the leading effect of small scale inhomogeneities on large
scale dynamics is to produce a traceless effective stress-energy tensor that
itself satisfies the weak energy condition. In this work, we illustrate the
nature of our framework by providing two explicit examples of one-parameter
families with backreaction. The first, based on previous work of Berger, is a
family of polarized vacuum Gowdy spacetimes on a torus, which satisfies all of
the assumptions of our framework. As the parameter approaches its limiting
value, the metric uniformly approaches a smooth background metric, but
spacetime derivatives of the deviation of the metric from the background metric
do not converge uniformly to zero. The limiting metric has nontrivial
backreaction from the small scale inhomogeneities, with an effective
stress-energy that is traceless and satisfies the weak energy condition, in
accord with our theorems. Our second one-parameter family consists of metrics
which have a uniform Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker limit. This family
satisfies all of our assumptions with the exception of the weak energy
condition for matter. In this case, the limiting metric has an effective
stress-energy tensor which is not traceless. We emphasize the importance of
imposing energy conditions on matter in studies of backreaction.

phase space. This M-function is the generator of time displacements and
contains all the dynamical information of the system. In this sense the
M-function plays the role of the hamiltonian function for mechanical systems.
In analogy with Hamilton theory we derive equations of motion as derivatives
over the resource function in phase space. A M-bracket is defined which allows
one to perform a geometrical approach in analogy to Poisson bracket of
hamiltonian systems. We show that the equations of motion can be derived from a
variational principle over a functional J of the trajectories. This functional
plays for M-systems the same role than the action S for hamiltonian systems.
Finally, three important systems in population dynamics, namely,
Lotka-Volterra, self-feeding and logistic evolution, are shown to be M-systems.

Semantic TupleSpace and uses the JavaSpace Service of the Jini Framework

supplies an interface where a client can execute the following operations: (i)
write: which inserts in the space available information along with its
respective meta-information, (ii) read: which retrieves from the space
information which meets specific meta-information constrains, and (iii) take:
which retrieves and simultaneously deletes from the space information which
meets specific meta-information constrains. In terms of this thesis the
available types of meta-information are based on ontologies described in RDFS

data-driven process adaptation has been ensured by an experimental evaluation
of the provided operations. Ultimately, we refer to open issues which could be

stars can yield uniquely valuable information about the still uncertain
properties of cold matter at several times the density of nuclear matter. One
method that could be used to measure $M$ and $R$ is to analyze the
energy-dependent waveforms of the X-ray flux oscillations seen during some
thermonuclear bursts from some neutron stars. These oscillations are thought to
be produced by X-ray emission from hotter regions on the surface of the star
that are rotating at or near the spin frequency of the star. Here we explore
how well $M$ and $R$ could be determined by generating, and analyzing using
Bayesian techniques, synthetic energy-resolved X-ray data that we produce
assuming a future space mission having 2--30 keV energy coverage and an
effective area of 10 m$^2$, such as the proposed \textit{LOFT} or
\textit{AXTAR} missions.
  We find that if the hot spot is within 10$^\circ$ of the rotation equator,
both $M$ and $R$ can usually be determined with an uncertainty of about 10% if
there are $10^6$ total counts from the spot, whereas waveforms from spots
within 20$^\circ$ of the rotation pole provide no useful constraints. These
constraints can usually be achieved even if the burst oscillations vary with
time and data from multiple bursts must be used to obtain 10$^6$ counts from
the hot spot. This is therefore a promising method to constrain $M$ and $R$
tightly enough to discriminate strongly between competing models of cold,
high-density matter.

  We apply the obtained results to a problem of classical mechanics: deciding
whether recently suggested functional classical mechanics is preferable to
traditional Newtonian one from the quantum-mechanical point of view. To do
this, we study the semiclassical limit of the Husimi functions of quantum
states. We show that functional mechanics remains valid at larger time scales

the need for a long wavelength baseline, and the drawbacks in fitting

significant ultraviolet extinction using existing broad-band optical,
near-infrared, and Spitzer photometry. The median extinction curve is
consistent with a Small Magellanic Cloud curve with A_1450 ~ 0.7 mag and does
not exhibit any conspicuous (restframe) 2175 A or 3000 A features. For two
QSOs, SDSS J1044-0125 at z = 5.78 and SDSS J1030+0524 at z = 6.31, we further

resulting non-parametric extinction curves do not exhibit the 3000 A kink.
Finally, in a re-analysis of literature spectra of SDSS J1048+4637, we do not
find evidence for a conspicuous kink. We conclude that the existing evidence

edges, it allows us to find an $\epsilon$-approximate maximum $s$-$t$ flow in
time $O(m^{1+o(1)}\epsilon^{-2})$, improving on the previous best bound of
$\tilde{O}(mn^{1/3} poly(1/\epsilon))$. Applying the same framework in the
multicommodity setting solves a maximum concurrent multicommodity flow problem
with $k$ commodities in $O(m^{1+o(1)}\epsilon^{-2}k^2)$ time, improving on the
existing bound of $\tilde{O}(m^{4/3} poly(k,\epsilon^{-1})$.
  Our algorithms utilize several new technical tools that we believe may be of
independent interest:
  - We give a non-Euclidean generalization of gradient descent and provide
bounds on its performance. Using this, we show how to reduce approximate
maximum flow and maximum concurrent flow to the efficient construction of
oblivious routings with a low competitive ratio.
  - We define and provide an efficient construction of a new type of flow
sparsifier. In addition to providing the standard properties of a cut
sparsifier our construction allows for flows in the sparse graph to be routed
(very efficiently) in the original graph with low congestion.
  - We give the first almost-linear-time construction of an
$O(m^{o(1)})$-competitive oblivious routing scheme. No previous such algorithm
ran in time better than $\tilde{{\Omega}}(mn)$.

sufficient angular resolution for a meaningful derivation of the central
cluster mass distribution. The problem lies mainly with cluster members which
perturb lensed images and generate additional images, requiring high resolution
modeling, even though we mainly wish to understand the relatively smooth
cluster component. The required resolution is not achievable because the
separation between lensed images is several times larger than the deflection
angles by member galaxies, even for the deepest data. Here we bypass this
limitation by incorporating a simple physical prior for member galaxies, using
their observed positions and their luminosity scaled masses. This galaxy
contribution is added to a relatively coarse Gaussian pixel grid for modeling
the cluster mass distribution, extending our established WSLAP code (Diego et
al. 2007). We test this new code with a simulation based on A1689, using the
pixels belonging to multiply-lensed images and the observed member galaxies.
Dealing with the cluster members this way leads to convergent solutions,
without resorting to regularization, reproducing well the input cluster and
substructures. We highlight the ability of this method to recover dark
sub-components of the cluster, unrelated to member galaxies. Such anomalies can
provide clues to the nature of invisible dark matter, but are hard to discover
using parametrized models where substructures are defined by the visible data.
With our increased resolution and stability we show, for the first time, that
non-parametric models can be made sufficiently precise to locate
multiply-lensed systems, thereby achieving fully self-consistent solutions
without reliance on input systems from less objective means.

multiple interpretations of each event, generalizing the Qjets procedure to
event-level analysis. With multiple interpretations, an event is no longer
restricted to either satisfy cuts or not satisfy them - it can be assigned a
weight between 0 and 1 based on how well it satisfies the cuts. These
cut-weights can then be used to improve the discrimination power of an analysis
or reduce the uncertainty on mass or cross-section measurements. For example,
using this approach on a Higgs plus Z boson sample, with h->bb we find an 28%

near-IR grism and enables precise redshift measurements for our sample of SFGs.
Structural properties are obtained from Sersic profile fits to CANDELS WFC3
imaging. The progenitors of z=0 SFGs with stellar mass M=10^{10.5} Msun are
typically half as massive at z~1. This late-time stellar mass assembly is
consistent with recent studies that employ abundance matching techniques. The
descendant SFGs at z~0 have grown in half-light radius by a factor of ~1.4
since z~1. The half-light radius grows with stellar mass as r_e M^{0.29}. While
most of the stellar mass is clearly assembling at large radii, the mass surface
density profiles reveal ongoing mass growth also in the central regions where
bulges and pseudobulges are common features in present day late-type galaxies.
Some portion of this growth in the central regions is due to star formation as
recent observations of H-alpha maps for SFGs at z~1 are found to be extended
but centrally peaked. Connecting our lookback study with galactic archeology,
we find the stellar mass surface density at R=8 kpc to have increased by a
factor of ~2 since z~1, in good agreement with measurements derived for the

with -3.3<[Fe/H]<-2.5. Excitation temperatures were determined from FeI line
abundances in high-resolution optical spectra in the wavelength range of ~3700
to ~7000A, although shorter wavelength ranges, up to 4750 to 6800A, can also be
employed, and compared with photometric literature temperatures. Our adjustment
scheme increases the temperatures up to several hundred degrees for cool red
giants, while leaving the near-main-sequence stars mostly unchanged. Hence, it
brings the excitation temperatures in good agreement with photometrically
derived values. The modified temperature also influences other stellar
parameters, as the FeI-FeII ionization balance is simultaneously used to
determine the surface gravity, while also forcing no abundance trend on the
absorption line strengths to obtain the microturbulent velocity. As a result of
increasing the temperature, the often too low gravities and too high
microturbulent velocities in red giants become higher and lower, respectively.
Our adjustment scheme thus continues to build on the advantage of deriving
temperatures from spectroscopy alone, independent of reddening, while at the
same time producing stellar chemical abundances that are more straightforwardly
comparable to studies based on photometrically derived temperatures. Hence, our
method may prove beneficial for comparing different studies in the literature
as well as the many high-resolution stellar spectroscopic surveys that are or
will be carried out in the next few years.

us to investigate subhalo properties and the correlation between subhalo masses

stacked over subhalos show a sharply truncated feature which is well-fitted by
a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) mass model with the truncation radius, as expected
due to tidal destruction by the main cluster. We also found that subhalo
masses, truncation radii, and mass-to-light ratios decrease toward the cluster
center. The subhalo mass function, dn/dln M_sub, in the range of 2 orders of
magnitude in mass, is well described by a single power law or a Schechter
function. Best-fit power indices of 1.09_-0.32^+0.42 for the former model and

the equilibrium physics for more realistic values of $N$ in varying spatial

disordered phase. If the model were to exhibit equilibration, the late time
state could be inferred from the finite temperature phase diagram. In the
infinite $N$ limit, we show that not only does the model not lead to
equilibration on account of an infinite number of conserved quantities, it also
does \emph{not} relax to a generalized Gibbs ensemble consistent with these
conserved quantities. Nevertheless, we \emph{still} find that the late time
states following quenches bear strong signatures of the equilibrium phase

non-equilibrium critical state only in dimensions $d>2$, that is, if the

the WDM halo mass function well below the cut-off. We discover a complex
picture, with perturbations at different evolutionary stages populating
different ranges in the halo mass function. On the smallest mass scales we can
resolve, identified objects are typically centres of filaments that are
starting to collapse. On intermediate mass scales, objects typically correspond
to fluctuations that have collapsed and are in the process of relaxation,
whereas the high mass end is dominated by objects similar to haloes identified
in CDM simulations. We then explicitly show how the formation of low-mass
haloes is suppressed, which translates into a strong cut-off in the halo mass
function. This disfavours some analytic formulations that predict a halo mass
function that would extend well below the free streaming mass. We argue for a
more detailed exploration of the formation of the smallest structures expected
to form in a given cosmology, which, we foresee, will advance our overall
understanding of structure formation.

approaches.
  Purpose. We aim to investigate which model parameters affect the calculated
cross section and how they do this.
  Method. The Giessen Boltzmann--Uehling--Uhlenbeck (GiBUU) model is used for
an investigation of neutrino-nucleus reactions.
  Results. Presented are integrated and differential cross sections for 1\pi^+

  Conclusions. For the MiniBooNE flux all processes (QE, 1\pi-background,
\Delta, higher resonance production, DIS) contribute to the observed final
state with one pion of a given charge. The uncertainty in elementary pion
production cross sections leads to a corresponding uncertainty in the nuclear

graph theory and topology. Computing it has been shown to be NP-hard by
[Thomassen '89 & '93], and it is known to be fixed-parameter tractable.
However, the approximability of the Euler genus is wide open. While the
existence of an O(1)-approximation is not ruled out, only an
O(sqrt(n))-approximation [Chen, Kanchi, Kanevsky '97] is known even in bounded
degree graphs. In this paper we give a polynomial-time algorithm which on input
a bounded-degree graph of Euler genus g, computes a drawing into a surface of
Euler genus poly(g, log(n)). Combined with the upper bound from [Chen, Kanchi,
Kanevsky '97], our result also implies a O(n^(1/2 - alpha))-approximation, for
some constant alpha>0.
  Using our algorithm for approximating the Euler genus as a subroutine, we
obtain, in a unified fashion, algorithms with approximation ratios of the form
poly(OPT, log(n)) for several related problems on bounded degree graphs. These
include the problems of orientable genus, crossing number, and planar edge and
vertex deletion problems. Our algorithm and proof of correctness for the
crossing number problem is simpler compared to the long and difficult proof in
the recent breakthrough by [Chuzhoy 2011], while essentially obtaining a
qualitatively similar result. For planar edge and vertex deletion problems our
results are the first to obtain a bound of form poly(OPT, log(n)).
  We also highlight some further applications of our results in the design of
algorithms for graphs with small genus. Many such algorithms require that a
drawing of the graph is given as part of the input. Our results imply that in
several interesting cases, we can implement such algorithms even when the
drawing is unknown.

Neutralinos with sufficiently large couplings to annihilate at such high a rate

null results of XENON100 and other direct detection experiments. One of the few
remaining ways that neutralinos could potentially evade such constraints is if
they annihilate through a resonance, as can occur if 2$m_{\chi^0}$ falls within
about $\sim$10% of either $m_{A/H}$, $m_h$, or $m_Z$. If no signal is observed
from upcoming direct detection experiments, the degree to which such a
resonance must be tuned will increase significantly. In this paper, we quantify
the degree to which such a resonance must be tuned in order to evade current
and projected constraints from direct detection experiments. Assuming a future
rate of progress among direct detection experiments that is similar to that
obtained over the past decade, we project that within 7 years the light Higgs

space near the $A/H$ resonance will require that $2m_{\chi^0}$ be matched to
the central value (near $m_A$) to within less than 4%. At this rate of
progress, it will be a little over a decade before multi-ton direct detection

these cross-section ratios on the multiplicity of associated jets, the boson

of the initial-state partons and an evaluation of the theoretical

down-quark ratio of parton distribution functions (PDFs), while other
theoretical uncertainties are negligible, meaning that a precise measurement of
the $W^+/W^-$ ratio at large boson $p_T$ values could constrain the PDFs at
larger momentum fractions $x$ than the usual inclusive $W$ charge asymmetry.
The $W^\pm/Z$ ratio is insensitive to PDFs and most other theoretical
uncertainties, other than possibly electroweak corrections, and a precise
measurement will therefore be useful in validating theoretical predictions
needed in data-driven methods, such as using $W(\to\ell\nu)$+jets events to
estimate the $Z(\to\nu\bar{\nu})$+jets background in searches for new physics

aligned nematic medium with a negative dielectric anisotropy. A spherical
particle that orients the liquid crystal (LC) perpendicularly to its surface
moves under the application of the uniform direct current (DC) or alternating
current (AC) electric field. The electric field causes no distortions of the LC
director far away from the sphere. Electrophoresis in the nematic LC shows two
types of nonlinearity in the velocity vs. field dependence. The velocity
component parallel to the applied electric field grows linearly with the field,
but when the field is high enough, it also shows a cubic dependence. The most
interesting is the second type of nonlinear electrophoresis that causes the
sphere to move perpendicularly to the applied field. This perpendicular
component of velocity is proportional to the square of the field. The effect
exists only in a LC and disappears when the material is melted into an
isotropic fluid. The quadratic effect is caused by the dipolar symmetry of
director distortions around the sphere and is classified as an LC-enabled
electrophoresis (LCEEP). The nonlinear electrophoretic mobility of particles in
LCEEP offers a rich variety of control parameters to design 3D trajectories of

viscosity reduce the CMB heat flow but produce only slightly longer-lived

cease for several billions of years and subsequently reactivate due to the
additional entropy production associated with inner core growth, a possible

solar dynamo model to study the reversals of the magnetic helicity sign for the
dynamo operating in the bulk of the solar convection zone. The evolution of the
magnetic helicity is governed by the conservation law. We found that the
reversal of the sign of the small-scale magnetic helicity follows the dynamo
wave propagating inside the convection zone. Therefore, the spatial patterns of
the magnetic helicity reversals reflect the processes which contribute to
generation and evolution of the large-scale magnetic fields. At the surface the
patterns of the helicity sign reversals are determined by the magnetic helicity
boundary conditions at the top of the convection zone. We demonstrate the
impact of fluctuations in the dynamo parameters and variability in dynamo cycle
amplitude on the reversals of the magnetic helicity sign rule. The obtained
results suggest that the magnetic helicity of the large-scale axisymmetric

terminals observing correlated sources and with the means to communicate over a
noiseless public com- munication channel. Our main result establishes a
structural equivalence between the generation of a maximum rate secret key and
the generation of a common randomness that renders the observations of the two
terminals conditionally independent. The minimum rate of such common
randomness, termed interactive common information, is related to Wyner's notion
of common information, and serves to characterize the minimum rate of
interactive public communication required to generate an optimum rate secret
key. This characterization yields a single-letter expression for the
aforementioned communication rate when the number of rounds of interaction are
bounded. An application of our results shows that interaction does not reduce
this rate for binary symmetric sources. Further, we provide an example for
which interaction does reduce the minimum rate of communication. Also, certain
invariance properties of common information quantities are established that may
be of independent interest.

it is often assumed that the networks experience scale-invariant evolution

an underestimation of the amplitude and broadness of the peak of the spectrum,

time of the charge carriers in the organic materials and their low cost,
flexibility and chemical diversity. In previous studies, the control of
resistance of organic spin valves is generally achieved by the alignment of the
magnetization directions of the two ferromagnetic electrodes, generating
magnetoresistance.1 Here we employ a new knob to tune the resistance of organic
spin valves by adding a thin ferroelectric interfacial layer between the
ferromagnetic electrode and the organic spacer. We show that the resistance can
be controlled by not only the spin alignment of the two ferromagnetic
electrodes, but also by the electric polarization of the interfacial
ferroelectric layer: the MR of the spin valve depends strongly on the history
of the bias voltage which is correlated with the polarization of the
ferroelectric layer; the MR even changes sign when the electric polarization of
the ferroelectric layer is reversed. This new tunability can be understood in
terms of the change of relative energy level alignment between ferromagnetic
electrode and the organic spacer caused by the electric dipole moment of the
ferroelectric layer. These findings enable active control of resistance using
both electric and magnetic fields, opening up possibility for multi-state
organic spin valves and shed light on the mechanism of the spin transport in
organic spin valves.

exceptionally bright optical flare in 2012 September. Following Fermi-LAT
detection of enhanced gamma-ray activity, we densely monitored this source in
the optical and near-infrared bands for the subsequent ten nights using twelve
telescopes in Japan and South-Africa. On MJD 56197 (2012 September 27, 4-5 days
after the peak of bright gamma-ray flare), polarized flux showed a transient
increase, while total flux and polarization angle remained almost constant
during the ""orphan polarized-flux flare"". We also detected an intra-night and
prominent flare on MJD 56202. The total and polarized fluxes showed quite
similar temporal variations, but PA again remained constant during the flare.
Interestingly, the polarization angles during the two flares were significantly
different from the jet direction. Emergence of a new emission component with
high polarization degree (PD) up to 40% would be responsible for the observed
two flares, and such a high PD indicates a presence of highly ordered magnetic
field at the emission site. We discuss that the well-ordered magnetic field and
even the observed directions of polarization angle which is grossly
perpendicular to the jet are reasonably accounted for by transverse shock(s)
propagating down the jet.

efficient allocation of survey manpower with more effective decision rules for
where/when to allocate those resources. In particular, given a clustered
distribution, ACS would result in a lower variance of the mean estimator than
Simple Random Sampling (SRS). This paper derives a linear inequality based on a
ratio of variances and the SRS sample size to determine the conditions under
which ACS would be a more appropriate sampling strategy. This inequality could
be used to make preliminary decisions on the potential benefits of pursuing an
ACS design over an SRS design. The relationship between relative efficiency of
ACS over SRS is discussed for (1) variable conditions for neighborhood
expansion (Conditions to Adpat) (2) the degree of clustering and (3) the
percent of hits in a particular neighborhood. Simulation results demonstrate
how 'rare' clusters should be for ACS to be a better design than SRS. The
relationships that emerge from the simulation provide insights that were not

of the magnetic entropy change has been brought out and implemented it to
deduce the critical exponents. The critical behavior study shows that the
magnetic interactions for x = 0 and 0.2 samples have two different behaviors
below and above TC. Below TC, it follows the mean field theory with long-range
magnetic interaction and above TC it follows the Heisenberg three-dimensional
model with short-range or local magnetic interaction. The magnetic exchange
interactions for the x = 0.6 and 1 samples follow the mean-field theory.

and a framework of approximate Bayesian computation. Temporal changes in human
subadult bone collagen turnover rates were estimated anew from data on

estimated turnover rates. The model is presented as a new open source R

the high energy band correspond to consecutive excitations of the
pseudorotational motion along the closed loop of the CI seam, and progressions
differ in the number of nodes along the radial mode perpendicular to the closed

For any $C^2$ transonic flow of Meyer type, the set of exceptional points is
shown to be a closed line segment (may be empty or only one point).
Furthermore, it is proved that a flow with nonexceptional points is unstable

whose sonic points are exceptional. For such a flow, its sonic curve must be

that the sonic curve is a characteristic degenerate boundary in the

period (B-P) diagram, where their relations to the millisecond pulsars (MSPs)
can be clearly shown. Generally, both BPSRs and MSPs are believed to be
recycled and spun-up in binary accreting phases, and evolved below the spin-up
line setting by the Eddington accretion rate ($\dot{M}{\bf \simeq}10^{18}
g/s$). It is noticed that most BPSRs are distributed around the spin-up line
with mass accretion rate $\dot{M}=10^{16} g/s$ and almost all MSP samples lie
above the spin-up line with $\dot{M}\sim10^{15} g/s$. Thus, we calculate that a
minimum accretion rate ($\dot{M}\sim 10^{15} g/s$) is required for the MSP
formation, and physical reasons for this are proposed. In the B-P diagram, the
positions of BPSRs and their relations to the binary parameters, such as the
companion mass, orbital period and eccentricity, are illustrated and discussed.
In addition, for the seven BPSRs located above the limit spin-up line, possible
causes are suggested.

learn statistically independent representation. However, ICA is not only
sensitive to whitening but also difficult to learn an over-complete basis.
Consequently, ICA with soft Reconstruction cost(RICA) was presented to learn
sparse representations with over-complete basis even on unwhitened data.
Whereas RICA is infeasible to represent the data with nonlinear structure due
to its intrinsic linearity. In addition, RICA is essentially an unsupervised
method and can not utilize the class information. In this paper, we propose a
kernel ICA model with reconstruction constraint (kRICA) to capture the
nonlinear features. To bring in the class information, we further extend the
unsupervised kRICA to a supervised one by introducing a discrimination
constraint, namely d-kRICA. This constraint leads to learn a structured basis
consisted of basis vectors from different basis subsets corresponding to
different class labels. Then each subset will sparsely represent well for its
own class but not for the others. Furthermore, data samples belonging to the
same class will have similar representations, and thereby the learned sparse
representations can take more discriminative power. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of kRICA and d-kRICA for image classification.

that the system consists of a massive primary with a mass of 17.63$\pm$0.91

12.56$\pm$0.81 M$_{\odot}$ and radius of 23.55$\pm$0.73 R$_{\odot}$,
corresponding spectral types of B0.5($\pm$2) II-III + B3($\pm$1) II. The
secondary star fills its corresponding Roche lobe and mass transfer to the
primary star is going on. This stream considerably does affect the photometric
observations both starting from the second quarter up to the first contact of
primary eclipse and just at the second maximum. Thus, the light curve is
distorted and tightly depended on the wavelength of the observations. The
available multi passband light curves have been analysed by taking the stream
effects, as either hot or cool spots, into account. The comparison of the
models and observations in the $\log(L/L_{\odot})$ - $\log T_{eff}$ and $\log g

with models and is predicted to be close to the phase of hydrogen shell
ignition. Average distance to the system is estimated as 4150$\pm$240 pc using

polynomials leading to a polynomial post-nonlinear mixing model. A Bayesian
algorithm is proposed to estimate the parameters involved in the model yielding
an unsupervised nonlinear unmixing algorithm. Due to the large number of
parameters to be estimated, an efficient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm is
investigated. The classical leapfrog steps of this algorithm are modified to
handle the parameter constraints. The performance of the unmixing strategy,

et al., J. Chem. Phys. 137, 4901 (2012)] to polymer systems in thermal
crossover between the good-solvent and the Theta regimes. We consider the
thermal crossover in the region in which tricritical effects can be neglected,
i.e. not too close to the Theta point, for a wide range of chain volume
fractions Phi=c/c* (c* is the overlap concentration), up to Phi=30. Scaling
crossover functions for global properties of the solution are obtained by
Monte-Carlo simulations of the Domb-Joyce model. They provide the input data to
develop a minimal coarse-grained model with four blobs per chain. As in the
good-solvent case, the coarse-grained model potentials are derived at zero
density, thus avoiding the inconsistencies related to the use of
state-dependent potentials. We find that the coarse-grained model reproduces
the properties of the underlying system up to some reduced density which
increases when lowering the temperature towards the Theta state. Close to the
lower-temperature crossover boundary, the tetramer model is accurate at least
up to Phi<10, while near the good-solvent regime reasonably accurate results
are obtained up to Phi<2. The density region in which the coarse-grained model
is predictive can be enlarged by developing coarse-grained models with more
blobs per chain. We extend the strategy used in the good-solvent case to the
crossover regime. This requires a proper treatment of the length rescalings as
before, but also a proper temperature redefinition as the number of blobs is
increased. The case n=10 is investigated. Comparison with full-monomer results
shows that the density region in which accurate predictions can be obtained is
significantly wider than that corresponding to the n=4 case.

harmonic oscillator basis. The RMF functional can be one of the following four
forms: the meson exchange or point-coupling nucleon interactions combined with
the nonlinear or density-dependent couplings. The pairing effects are taken
into account with the BCS approach. The 1-, 2-, and 3-D potential energy
surfaces (PES's) of $^{240}$Pu are illustrated for numerical checks and for the
study of the effect of the triaxiality on the fission barriers. Potential
energy curves of even-even actinide nuclei around the first and second fission
barriers are studied systematically. Besides the first ones, the second fission
barriers in these nuclei are also lowered considerably by the triaxial
deformation. This lowering effect is independent of the effective interactions
used in the RMF functionals. Further discussions are made about different
predictions on the effect of the triaxiality between the
macroscopic-microscopic and MDC-RMF models, possible discontinuities on PES's
from self-consistent approaches, and the restoration of broken symmetries.
MDC-RMF models give reasonably good description of fission barriers of
even-even actinide nuclei. It is important to include both the nonaxial and the
reflection asymmetric shapes simultaneously for the study of PES's and fission
barriers of actinide nuclei and of those in unknown mass regions such as, e.g.,

  process","29 pages",,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a new approach to quantize the marginals of the discrete Euler
diffusion process. The method is built recursively and involves the conditional
distribution of the marginals of the discrete Euler process. Analytically, the
method raises several questions like the analysis of the induced quadratic
quantization error between the marginals of the Euler process and the proposed
quantizations. We show in particular that at every discretization step $t\_k$
of the Euler scheme, this error is bounded by the cumulative quantization
errors induced by the Euler operator, from times $t\_0=0$ to time $t\_k$. For
numerics, we restrict our analysis to the one dimensional setting and show how
to compute the optimal grids using a Newton-Raphson algorithm. We then propose
a closed formula for the companion weights and the transition probabilities
associated to the proposed quantizations. This allows us to quantize in
particular diffusion processes in local volatility models by reducing
dramatically the computational complexity of the search of optimal quantizers
while increasing their computational precision with respect to the algorithms
commonly proposed in this framework. Numerical tests are carried out for the
Brownian motion and for the pricing of European options in a local volatility
model. A comparison with the Monte Carlo simulations shows that the proposed
method may sometimes be more efficient (w.r.t. both computational precision and
time complexity) than the Monte Carlo method.

practical attacks have successfully been demonstrated. Fortunately, most of
them only exploit detection-side loopholes which are now closed by the recent
idea of measurement-device-independent QKD. On the other hand, little attention
is paid to the source which may still leave QKD systems insecure. In this work,
we propose and demonstrate an attack that exploits a source-side loophole
existing in qubit-based QKD systems using a weak coherent state source and
decoy states. Specifically, by implementing a linear-optics
unambiguous-state-discrimination measurement, we show that the security of a

outline a prospective low-energy extension that utilizes the clear ice of the
South Pole. Aiming at a 10 Mton effective volume and a 10 MeV threshold, the
detector would provide sufficient sensitivity to detect neutrino bursts from
core-collapse supernovae (SNe) in nearby galaxies. The detector geometry and
required density of instrumentation are discussed along with the requirements
to control the various sources of background, such as solar neutrinos. In
particular, the suppression of spallation events induced by atmospheric muons
poses a challenge that will need to be addressed. Assuming this background can
be controlled, we find that the resulting detector will be able to detect SNe
from beyond 10 Mpc, delivering between 10 and 41 regular core-collapse SN
detections per decade. It would further allow to study more speculative
phenomena, such as optically dark (failed) SNe, where the collapse proceeds
directly to a black hole, at a detection rate similar to that of regular SNe.
We find that the biggest technological challenge lies in the required number of
large area photo-sensors, with simultaneous strict limits on the allowed noise
rates. If both can be realized, the detector concept we present will reach the
required sensitivity with a comparatively small construction effort and hence
offers a route to future routine observations of SNe with neutrinos.

critical points in a model of interacting spinfull fermions - a BCS-like model.
Due to the exact diagonalizability of the model, in one and higher dimensions,
scaling of the ground-state fidelity can be analyzed numerically with great
accuracy, not only for small systems but also for macroscopic ones, together
with the crossover region between them. Additionally, in one-dimensional case
we have been able to derive a number of analytical formulae for fidelity and
show that they accurately fit our numerical results; these results are reported
in the article. Besides regular critical points and their neighborhoods, where
well-known scaling laws are obeyed, there is the multi-critical point and
critical points in its proximity where anomalous scaling behavior is found. We
consider also scaling of fidelity in neighborhoods of critical points where
fidelity oscillates strongly as the system size or the chemical potential is
varied. Our results for a one-dimensional version of a BCS-like model are
compared with those obtained by Rams and Damski in similar studies of a quantum
spin chain - an anisotropic XY model in transverse magnetic field.

based on the [alpha/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] plot to separate Galactic stellar
populations into the thin disk, thick disk and high-alpha metal-rich (hamr).
Our analysis shows a negative gradient of the rotational velocity of the thin
disk stars with [Fe/H] (-17 km s^-1 dex^-1), and a steep positive gradient for
both the thick disk and hamr stars with the same magnitude of about +42 km s^-1
dex^-1. For the thin disk stars we observed no correlation between orbital
eccentricities and metallicity, but observed a steep negative gradient for the
thick disk and hamr stars with practically the same magnitude (about -0.18
dex^-1). Our results suggest that radial migration played an important role in
the formation and evolution of the thin disk. For the thick disk stars it is
not possible to reach a firm conclusion about their origin. Based on the
eccentricity distribution of the thick disk stars only their accretion origin
can be ruled out, and the heating and migration scenario could explain the
positive steep gradient of V_phi with [Fe/H]. Analyzing the hamr stellar
population we found that they share properties of both the thin and thick disk
population. A comparison of the properties of the hamr stars with that of the
subsample of stars from the N-body/SPH simulation using radial migration
suggest that they may have originated from the inner Galaxy. Further detailed
investigations would help to clarify their exact nature and origin.

cell interaction of a BRT can be specified by a measure kernel, the so-called
division kernel, that determines the division rules of all cells and gives rise
to a Gibbsian characterisation of BRTs. For translation invariant BRTs, we
introduce an ""inner"" entropy density relative to a STIT tessellation. Together
with an inner energy density for a given ""moderate"" division kernel, this leads
to a variational principle for BRTs with this prescribed kernel, and further to
an existence result for such BRTs.

the minimum network distance from $s$ to $t$, while a shortest path query
computes the actual route that achieves the minimum distance. These two types
of queries find important applications in practice, and a plethora of solutions
have been proposed in past few decades. The existing solutions, however, are
optimized for either practical or asymptotic performance, but not both. In
particular, the techniques with enhanced practical efficiency are mostly
heuristic-based, and they offer unattractive worst-case guarantees in terms of
space and time. On the other hand, the methods that are worst-case efficient
often entail prohibitive preprocessing or space overheads, which render them
inapplicable for the large road networks (with millions of nodes) commonly used
in modern map applications.
  This paper presents {\em Arterial Hierarchy (AH)}, an index structure that
narrows the gap between theory and practice in answering shortest path and
distance queries on road networks. On the theoretical side, we show that, under
a realistic assumption, AH answers any distance query in $\tilde{O}(\log \r)$
time, where $\r = d_{max}/d_{min}$, and $d_{max}$ (resp.\ $d_{min}$) is the
largest (resp.\ smallest) $L_\infty$ distance between any two nodes in the road
network. In addition, any shortest path query can be answered in $\tilde{O}(k +
\log \r)$ time, where $k$ is the number of nodes on the shortest path. On the
practical side, we experimentally evaluate AH on a large set of real road
networks with up to twenty million nodes, and we demonstrate that (i) AH

firstly establish the local well-posedness result in Besov spaces, and then

the existence of single peakon by the method of analysis.

lattices. A special emphasis is placed on an anomalous hysteresis behavior, in
which the phase transition occurs in a unidirectional way and a hysteresis loop
does not form. We first revisit the hardcore Bose-Hubbard model with
dipole-dipole interactions on a triangular lattice to analyze accurately the
ground-state phase diagram and the hysteresis using the cluster mean-field
theory combined with cluster-size scaling. Details of the anomalous hysteresis
are presented. We next consider the two-component and spin-1 Bose-Hubbard
models on a hypercubic lattice and show that the anomalous hysteresis can
emerge in these systems as well. In particular, for the former model, we
discuss the experimental feasibility of the first-order transitions and the
associated hysteresis. We also explain an underlying mechanism of the anomalous
hysteresis by means of the Ginzburg-Landau theory. From the given cases, we
conclude that the anomalous hysteresis is a ubiquitous phenomenon of systems
with a phase region of lobe shape that is surrounded by the first-order
boundary.

applications. Whereas the asymptotic convergence rate has been extensively
explored in prior work, other important and practical issues, including energy
efficiency and link reliability, have received relatively little attention. In
this paper, we present a distributed consensus approach that can achieve a good
balance between convergence rate and energy efficiency.
  The approach selects a subset of links that significantly contribute to the
formation of consensus at each iteration, thus adapting the network's topology
dynamically to the changes of the sensor states. A global optimization problem
is formulated for optimal link selection, which is subsequently factorized into
sub-problems that can be solved locally, and practically via approximation. An
algorithm is derived to solve the approximation efficiently, using quadratic
programming (QP) relaxation and random sampling. Simulations on networks of
different types demonstrate that the proposed method reduces the communication
energy costs without significantly impacting the convergence rate and that the
approach is robust to link failures.

magnetorotational instability in the case of vanishing net flux. Motivated by a
recent paper of Bodo, Cattaneo, Mignone, & Rossi, we here focus on the case of
a non-isothermal equation of state with constant thermal diffusivity. The
central aim of the paper is to complement the previous result with closure
parameters for mean-field dynamo models, and to test the hypothesis that the
dynamo is affected by the mode of heat transport. We perform computer
simulations of local shearing-box models of stratified accretion disks with
approximate treatment of radiative heat transport, which is modeled via thermal
conduction. We study the effect of varying the (constant) thermal diffusivity,
and apply different vertical boundary conditions. In the case of impenetrable
vertical boundaries, we confirm the transition from mainly conductive to mainly
convective vertical heat transport below a critical thermal diffusivity. This
transition is however much less dramatic when more natural outflow boundary
conditions are applied. Similarly, the enhancement of magnetic activity in this
case is less pronounced. Nevertheless, heating via turbulent dissipation
determines the thermodynamic structure of accretion disks, and clearly affects
the properties of the related dynamo. This effect may however have been
overestimated in previous work, and a careful study of the role played by
boundaries will be required.

bosons, produced in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV, and decaying to two
tau leptons with pseudorapidities between 2.0 and 4.5, are presented. The
result is based on a dataset, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.0
$\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$, collected with the LHCb detector. Candidates are identified
by reconstructing final states with two muons, a muon and an electron, a muon
and a hadron, or an electron and a hadron. A model independent upper limit at
the 95% confidence level is set on a neutral Higgs boson cross-section times
branching fraction. It varies from 8.6 pb for a Higgs boson mass of 90 GeV to
0.7 pb for a Higgs boson mass of 250 GeV, and is compared to the Standard Model
expectation. An upper limit on $\tan\beta$ in the Minimal Supersymmetric Model
is set in the $m_{h^0}^\mathrm{max}$ scenario. It ranges from 34 for a CP-odd
Higgs boson mass of 90 GeV to 70 for a pseudo-scalar Higgs boson mass of 140

finite QCD effective charge from a special kinematic limit of the vertex
function corresponding to three background gluons. This particular Green's
function satisfies a QED-like Ward identity, relating it to the gluon
propagator, with no reference to the ghost sector. Consequently, its
longitudinal form factors may be expressed entirely in terms of the
corresponding gluon wave function, whose inverse is proportional to the
effective charge. After reviewing certain important theoretical properties, we
consider a typical lattice quantity involving this vertex, and derive its exact
dependence on the various form factors, for arbitrary momenta. We then focus on
the particular momentum configuration that eliminates any dependence on the
(unknown) transverse form factors, projecting out only the desired quantity. A
preliminary numerical analysis indicates that the effective charge is
relatively insensitive to the numerical uncertainties that may afflict future
simulations of the aforementioned lattice quantity. The numerical difficulties
associated with a parallel determination of the dynamical gluon mass are
briefly discussed.

Hamiltonian with spatially anisotropic exchange parameters Jc, Ja, and Jac
extended along the c, a, and a +/- c lattice directions and apply it to
describe fascinating physics of copper carbodiimide CuNCN in the assumption of
resonating valence bond (RVB) type of its phases. These are invoked to explain
the intriguing absence of magnetic order in CuNCN down to 4 K. We show that the
quasiparticle spectrum of the RVB model of the proposed Hamiltonian has three
principal regimes: (i) one with two pairs of lines of nodes, (ii) one with a
pair of lines of nodes (termed as 1D- and Q1D-RVB states), (iii) and one with
two pseudogaps and four nodal points (2D-RVB). We present a complete
parameters-temperature phase diagram of the model constructed with use of the
high-temperature expansion of the free energy. The phase diagram thus obtained
contains eight different phases whose magnetic behavior includes Curie and
Pauli paramagnetism (respectively, in disordered and 1D- or Q1D-RVB phases),
and gapped (quasi-Arrhenius) paramagnetism (2D-RVB phases). Adding
magnetostriction and elastic terms to the free energy we derive possible
structural manifestations of transitions between RVB phases. Assuming a
sequence of transitions between RVB phases to occur in CuNCN while temperature
decreases explains the features observed in the temperature runs of the
magnetic susceptibility and lattice constants. Confronting these with the
magnetic susceptibility and structure data measured as functions of temperature
in the range between ca. 20 and 200 K we show a remarkably good agreement
between our theoretical predictions and the experiment as reached by ascribing
the model parameters values which are intuitively acceptable both in terms of
their absolute and relative magnitudes and of the character of their geometry
dependence.

As a side-effect of exhaustive tests for an algorithm for which a convex hull
computation was the first step, interesting experimental results were found and
are the sunject of this paper. They establish that the number of convex
vertices of natural datasets can be predicted, if not precisely at least within
a defined range. Namely it was found that the number of convex vertices of a
dataset of N points lies in the range 2.35 N^0.091 <= h <= 19.19 N^0.091. This
range obviously does not describe neither natural nor artificial worst-cases
but corresponds to the distributions of natural data. This can be used for
instance to define a starting size for pre-allocated arrays or to evaluate
output-sensitive algorithms. A further consequence of these results is that the
random models of data used to test convex hull algorithms should be bounded by
rectangles and not as they usually are by circles if they want to represent

been used to reproduce the X-ray data. This paper presents new optical
polarimetric data of CP Tuc and a model that consistently explains its optical
and X-ray data. The model was based on an extension of the CYCLOPS code that
added X-ray bremsstrahlung emission and pre-shock region absorption to the
original version, which only accounted for cyclotron emission. The new code
creates the possibility of simultaneous optical and X-ray fitting. We show that
self-eclipse and absorption data have distinct signatures on the X-ray spectra.
Although we were able to reasonably fit the CP Tuc optical data to cases of
absorption and self-eclipse, we were only able to reproduce the X-ray orbital
modulation after considering the absorption in the pre-shock region.
Specifically, we were unable to reproduce the X-ray observations in the
self-eclipse case. We found that the primary emitting region in CP Tuc is
located near the rotation pole that approximately points to the observer.

generated by the Chen system. To enhance the efficiency, only expanded XOR

results show that the new scheme owns a large key space and can resist the

actually increases if site-5 is disconnected from the complex entirely. We
further show that if site-5 and site-7 are conjointly removed, the efficiency
falls. This suggests that while not contributing to the transport efficiency in

based on the lack of character affinity with the defining synapomorphies of the
clade. The clade Hypsilophodontidae (=Hypsilophodontia), along with
Iguanodontia, however is deemed to be in critical need of refinement to account
for recent discoveries and re-classifications of certain euornithopods. Several
of the synapomorphies are out-dated and deemed redundant in favour of a more
quantifiable approach. Re- definition of these clades is critical if the
current state of basal euornithopodan relationships is to be resolved.
Phylogenetic studies must be approached from a multidisciplinary perspective;
integration of tectonostratigraphical, ontogenetic, palaeoecological, and
biomechanical data with sets of well-defined primary homologies are essential
in increasing phylogenetic resolution and generating stratigraphically feasible
ancestor-descendant relationships. Material attributed to Tenontosaurus
tilletti is in need of strict re-analysis; the significant quantity of
specimens attributed to this species is potentially the result of poor
stratigraphic constraints and the vast spatiotemporal span occupied. Future
revision of this material is expected to reveal temporal variations on the
species -level inherently linked to environmental evolution, as well as
possibly provide clues to sexual dimorphism in contemporaneous, yet
morphologically distinct tenontosaurs.

density functional perturbation theory, to calculate the anharmonic scattering
coefficients among three phonons with arbitrary wavevectors. The method is used
to study the phonon broadening in graphite and graphene mono- and bi-layer. The
broadening of the high-energy optical branches is highly nonuniform and
presents a series of sudden steps and spikes. At finite temperature, the two
linearly dispersive acoustic branches TA and LA of graphene have nonzero
broadening for small wavevectors. The broadening in graphite and bi-layer
graphene is, overall, very similar to the graphene one, the most remarkable
feature being the broadening of the quasi acoustical ZO' branch. Finally, we
study the intrinsic anharmonic contribution to the thermal conductivity of the
three systems, within the single mode relaxation time approximation. We find
the conductance to be in good agreement with experimental data for the
out-of-plane direction but to underestimate it by a factor 2 in-plane.

At high luminosities, these variations are often associated with the onset and
growth of the accretion column, which is believed to be the origin of the
observed emission and of the cyclotron lines. However, this scenario inevitably
implies large gradient of the magnetic field strength within the line-forming

problematic. Moreover, the observed variation of the cyclotron line energy is
much smaller than could be anticipated for the corresponding luminosity
changes. We argue here that a more physically realistic situation is that the
cyclotron line forms when the radiation emitted by the accretion column is
reflected from the neutron star surface, where the gradient of the magnetic
field strength is significantly smaller. We develop here the reflection model
and apply it to explain the observed variations of the cyclotron line energy in

polycistronic transcript, under the control of a single promoter. In animals,
protein-coding polycistronic transcripts are rare. However, microRNAs are
frequently clustered in the genomes of animals, and these clusters are often
transcribed as a single unit. The evolution of microRNA clusters has been the
subject of much speculation, and a selective advantage of clusters of
functionally related microRNAs is often proposed. However, the origin of
microRNA clusters has not been so far explored. Here we study the evolution of
microRNA clusters in Drosophila melanogaster. We observed that the majority of
microRNA clusters arose by the de novo formation of new microRNA-like hairpins
in existing microRNA transcripts. Some clusters also emerged by tandem
duplication of a single microRNA. Comparative genomics show that these clusters
are unlikely to split or undergo rearrangements. We did not find any instances
of clusters appearing by rearrangement of pre-existing microRNA genes. We
propose a model for microRNA cluster evolution in which selection over one of
the microRNAs in the cluster interferes with the evolution of the other linked
microRNAs. Our analysis suggests that the study of microRNAs and small RNAs
must consider linkage associations.

  with sti relaxation: application to angular models in linear transport",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we propose an asymptotic preserving scheme for a family of
Friedrichs systems on unstructured meshes based on a decomposition between the
hyperbolic heat equation and a linear hyperbolic which not involved in the di
usive regime. For the hyperbolic heat equation we use asymptotic preserving
schemes recently designed previously. To discretize the second part we use
classical Rusanov or upwind schemes. To nish we apply this method for the
discretization of the PN and SN models which are widely used in transport
codes.

opportunities to change the objects in arbitrary ways during their existence. A
traditional realization of OO paradigm in modern programming systems has
fundamental drawbacks which complicate an implementation of persistent
modifiable objects considerably. There is alternative realization that does not
have these drawbacks. In the article the PROGRESS operation is offered, which
modify existing object within an existing inheritance hierarchy.

the assumptions of a quasi local mass form (the Misner-Sharp mass) and
geometric surface gravity in a spherically symmetric spacetime. The deduction
is extended to other cases such as the de Sitter, anti-de Sitter,
Reissner-Nordstr\""om and higher dimensional spacetimes. This paper demonstrates
the simple hypotheses to obtain these known spherically symmetric solutions via
thermodynamics, where essentially the Misner-Sharp mass is the mass for an
adiabatic system.

(CCQGLE), a canonical equation governing the weakly nonlinear behavior of
dissipative systems in a wide variety of disciplines, reveal five entirely
novel classes of pulse or solitary waves solutions, viz. pulsating, creeping,
snaking, erupting, and chaotical solitons. Here, we develop a theoretical
framework for analyzing the full spatio-temporal structure of one class of
dissipative solution (snaking soliton) of the CCQGLE using the variational
approximation technique and the dynamical systems theory. The qualitative
behavior of the snaking soliton is investigated using the numerical simulations
of (a) the full nonlinear complex partial differential equation and (b) a
system of three ordinary differential equations resulting from the variational
approximation.

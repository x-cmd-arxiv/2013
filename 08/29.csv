the edges of a graph G are either open or closed and refresh their status at

descriptions of $G(\mathbb{Z})$, due to Tits, are functorial and not amenable
to computation or applications. We construct Kac-Moody groups over $\mathbb{R}$

construction of Eisenstein series on finite dimensional semisimple algebraic
groups using representation theory, which appeared in the context of
superstring theory, to general Kac-Moody groups. This coincides with a
generalization of Garland's Eisenstein series on affine Kac-Moody groups to
general Kac-Moody groups and includes Eisenstein series on $E_{10}$ and
$E_{11}$. For finite dimensional groups, Eisenstein series encode the quantum
corrections in string theory and supergravity theories. Their Kac-Moody analogs
will likely also play an important part in string theory, though their roles

Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) is used to
investigate propagating disturbances (PDs) in warm fan loops at the periphery

coronal temperatures, a new data analysis methodology is proposed enabling
quantitative description of subvisual coronal motions with low signal-to-noise
ratios of the order of 0.1 %. The technique operates with a set of
one-dimensional ""surfing"" signals extracted from position-time plots of several
AIA channels through a modified version of Radon transform. The signals are
used to evaluate a two-dimensional power spectral density distribution in the
frequency - velocity space which exhibits a resonance in the presence of
quasi-periodic PDs. By applying this analysis to the same fan loop structures
observed in several AIA channels, we found that the traveling velocity of PDs
increases with the temperature of the coronal plasma following the square root
dependence predicted for the slow mode magneto-acoustic wave which seems to be
the dominating wave mode in the studied loop structures. This result extends
recent observations by Kiddie et al. (Solar Phys., 2012) to a more general
class of fan loop systems not associated with sunspots and demonstrating
consistent slow mode activity in up to four AIA channels.

the emergence process is capable of producing a coronal flux rope by the
transfer of twist from the convection zone as found in previous simulations. We
find that this flux rope is stable, with no evidence of a fast rise, and that
its ultimate height in the corona is determined by the strength of the
pre-existing dipole field. We also find that although the electric currents in
the initial convection zone flux tube are almost perfectly neutralized, the
resultant coronal flux rope carries a significant net current. These results
suggest that flux tube emergence is capable of creating non-current-neutralized

this paper will resolve several key questions on shearlets. We provide a

feature of wavelet analysis for fast numerical implementation of a wavelet

filter banks. In order to study affine shear tight frames with MRA structure,
we introduce the notion of a sequence of affine shear tight frames and then we
provide a complete characterization for it. Based on our characterizations, we
present two different approaches, i.e., non-stationary and quasi-stationary,
for the construction of sequences of affine shear tight frames with MRA
structure such that all their generators are smooth (in the Schwarz class) and
they have underlying filter banks. Consequently, their associated transforms

induces a tendency toward an interaction-generated quantum anomalous Hall
phase, as borne out in mean-field theory. However, quantum fluctuations prevent
the formation of a stable quantum Hall phase before the onset of the
charge-modulated phase predicted at large $V_2$ by mean-field theory.
Consequently, the system undergoes a direct transition from the semimetal to
the charge-modulated phase. For the latter, charge fluctuations also play a key
role. While the phase, which is related to pinball liquids, is stabilized by
the repulsion $V_2$, the energy of its low-lying charge excitations scales with
the electronic hopping $t$, as in a band insulator.

generation of galaxies, at z < 10. The expected optically thin spontaneous
alpha-line luminosities are calculated as a function of the absolute AB
magnitude of a galaxy at 1500 angstrom. For a blind search, semi-empirical
luminosity functions are used to calculate the number of galaxies whose
expected flux densities exceed an assumed detectability threshold. Plots of the
minimum sky area, within which at least one detectable galaxy is expected at a
given observing frequency, in the fiducial instantaneous passband of 10^4 km/s,
allow to assess the blind search time necessary for detection by a given
facility. We show that the chances for detection are the highest in the mm and
submm domains, but finding spontaneous emission in a blind search, especially
from redshifts z >> 1, is a challenge even with powerful facilities, such as
ALMA and SKA. The probability of success is higher for a targeted search of
lines with principal quantum number n ~ 10 in Lyman-break galaxies amplified by
gravitational lensing. Detection of more than one hydrogen line in such a
galaxy will allow for line identification and a precise determination of the

applied research, but surprisingly the role of excitons in the coherent
processes leading to harmonics generation has remained essentially unexplored.
Here we report results of a comprehensive experimental and theoretical study of
the three-photon process of optical second harmonic generation (SHG) involving
the exciton resonances of the noncentrosymmetric hexagonal wide-band-gap
semiconductor ZnO in the photon energy range of 3.2-3.5 eV. Resonant
crystallographic SHG is observed for the 1s(A,B), 2s(A,B), 2p(A,B), and 1s(C)
excitons. We show that strong SHG signals at these exciton resonances are
induced by the application of a magnetic field when the incident and the SHG
light wave vectors are along the crystal z-axis where the crystallographic SHG
response vanishes. A microscopic theory of SHG generation through excitons is
developed, which shows that the nonlinear interaction of coherent light with
excitons has to be considered beyond the electric-dipole approximation.
Depending on the particular symmetry of the exciton states SHG can originate
from the electric- and magnetic-field-induced perturbations of the excitons due
to the Stark effect, the spin as well as orbital Zeeman effects, or the
magneto-Stark effect. The importance of each mechanism is analyzed and
discussed by confronting experimental data and theoretical results for the
dependencies of the SHG signals on photon energy, magnetic field, electric
field, crystal temperature, and light polarization. Good agreement is obtained
between experiment and theory proving the validity of our approach to the
complex problem of nonlinear interaction of light with ZnO excitons. This
general approach can be applied also to other semiconductors.

the framework of Bayesian inference. In the Part I companion to this paper
(arXiv.org:1308.1313), we considered the linearized infinite-dimensional
inverse problem. Here in Part II, we relax the linearization assumption and
consider the fully nonlinear infinite-dimensional inverse problem using a
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling method. To address the challenges of
sampling high-dimensional pdfs arising from Bayesian inverse problems governed
by PDEs, we build on the stochastic Newton MCMC method. This method exploits
problem structure by taking as a proposal density a local Gaussian
approximation of the posterior pdf, whose construction is made tractable by
invoking a low-rank approximation of its data misfit component of the Hessian.
Here we introduce an approximation of the stochastic Newton proposal in which
we compute the low-rank-based Hessian at just the MAP point, and then reuse
this Hessian at each MCMC step. We compare the performance of the proposed
method to the original stochastic Newton MCMC method and to an independence
sampler. The comparison of the three methods is conducted on a synthetic ice
sheet inverse problem. For this problem, the stochastic Newton MCMC method with
a MAP-based Hessian converges at least as rapidly as the original stochastic
Newton MCMC method, but is far cheaper since it avoids recomputing the Hessian
at each step. On the other hand, it is more expensive per sample than the
independence sampler; however, its convergence is significantly more rapid, and
thus overall it is much cheaper. Finally, we present extensive analysis and
interpretation of the posterior distribution, and classify directions in
parameter space based on the extent to which they are informed by the prior or
the observations.

We use a sample of 650 projected quasar pairs to study the HI Lya absorption
transverse to luminous, z~2 quasars at proper separations of 30kpc < R < 1Mpc.
In contrast to measurements along the line-of-sight, regions transverse to
quasars exhibit enhanced HI Lya absorption and a larger variance than the
ambient intergalactic medium, with increasing absorption and variance toward
smaller scales. Analysis of composite spectra reveals excess absorption
characterized by a Lya equivalent width profile W = 2.3A (R/100kpc)^-0.46. We
also observe a high (~60%) covering factor of strong, optically thick HI
absorbers (HI column log NHI > 17.3) at separations R<200kpc, which decreases
to ~20% at R~1Mpc, but still represents a significant excess over the cosmic
average. This excess of optically thick absorption can be described by a
quasar-absorber cross-correlation function xi_QA(r) = (r/r_0)^gamma with a
large correlation length r_0 = 12.5+2.7-1.4 Mpc/h (comoving) and gamma =
1.68+0.14-0.30. The HI absorption measured around quasars exceeds that of any
previously studied population, consistent with quasars being hosted by massive
dark matter halos Mhalo~10^12.5 Msun at z~2.5. The environments of these
massive halos are highly biased towards producing optically thick gas, and may
even dominate the cosmic abundance of Lyman limit systems and hence the
intergalactic opacity to ionizing photons at z~2.5. The anisotropic absorption
around quasars implies the transverse direction is much less likely to be
illuminated by ionizing radiation than the line-of-sight, which we interpret in
terms of the same obscuration effects frequently invoked in unified models of
active galactic nuclei.

demonstrate the origin of the first localized solution in a modulational
symmetry-breaking Hopf bifurcation from a known global travelling wave that has
2-fold rotational symmetry about the pipe axis. Similar behaviour is found for
a global wave of 3-fold rotational symmetry, this time leading to two localized
relative periodic orbits. The clear implication is that all global solutions
should be expected to lead to more realistic localised counterparts through
such bifurcations, which provides a constructive route for their generation.

Wakefield Cherenkov losses of short bunches have been studied previously for

reads being uniquely mapped to the reference genome, a quantitative analysis of
the influence of read lengths on mappability has been lacking. To address this
question, we evaluate the k-mer distribution of the human reference genome. The
k-mer frequency is determined for k ranging from 20 to 1000 basepairs. We use
the proportion of non-singleton k-mers to evaluate the mappability of reads for
a corresponding read length. We observe that the proportion of non-singletons
decreases slowly with increasing k, and can be fitted by piecewise power-law
functions with different exponents at different k ranges. A faster decay at
smaller values for k indicates more limited gains for read lengths > 200
basepairs. The frequency distributions of k-mers exhibit long tails in a
power-law-like trend, and rank frequency plots exhibit a concave Zipf's curve.

disease variants from a list of disease associated variants in the genome. For
designing such experiments, candidate variants are ranked by their strength of
genetic association with the disease. However, the two commonly used measures
of genetic association, the odds-ratio (OR) and p-value, may rank variants in
different order. To integrate these two measures into a single analysis, here
we transfer the volcano plot methodology from gene expression analysis to
genetic association studies. In its original setting, volcano plots are scatter
plots of fold-change and t-test statistic (or -log of the p-value), with the
latter being more sensitive to sample size. In genetic association studies, the
OR and Pearson's chi-square statistic (or equivalently its square root, chi; or
the standardized log(OR)) can be analogously used in a volcano plot, allowing
for their visual inspection. Moreover, the geometric interpretation of these
plots leads to an intuitive method for filtering results by a combination of
both OR and chi-square statistic, which we term ""regularized-chi"". This method
selects associated markers by a smooth curve in the volcano plot instead of the
right-angled lines which corresponds to independent cutoffs for OR and
chi-square statistic. The regularized-chi incorporates relatively more signals
from variants with lower minor-allele-frequencies than chi-square test
statistic. As rare variants tend to have stronger functional effects,
regularized-chi is better suited to the task of prioritization of candidate
genes.

the Shapley value to games with externalities (partition-function games). When
externalities are present, not only can a player's marginal contribution - a
central notion to the Shapley value - be defined in a variety of ways, but it
is also not obvious which axiomatization should be used. Consequently, a number
of authors extended the Shapley value using complex and often unintuitive
axiomatizations. Furthermore, no algorithm to approximate any extension of the
Shapley value to partition-function games has been proposed to date. Given this
background, we prove in this paper that, for any well-defined measure of
marginal contribution, Shapley's original four axioms imply a unique value for
games with externalities. As an consequence of this general theorem, we show
that values proposed by Macho-Stadler et al., McQuillin and Bolger can be

financial market under the Knightian uncertainty, and pricing the ask and bid
prices of the uncertain risk. We use the nonlinear analysis tool, i.e., G-frame
work [26], to construct the model of the risky asset price and bid-ask pricing
for the European contingent claims under Knightian uncertain financial market.
Firstly, we consider the basic risky asset price model on the uncertain
financial market, which we construct here is the model with drift uncertain and
volatility uncertain. We describe such model by using generalized G-Brownian
motion and call it as G-asset price system. We present the uncertain risk
premium which is uncertain and distributed with maximum distribution. We derive
the closed form of bid-ask price of the European contingent claim against the
underlying risky asset with G-asset price system as the discounted conditional
G-expecation of the claim, and the bid and ask prices are the viscosity
solutions to the nonlinear HJB equations.Furthermore, we consider the main part
of this paper, i.e., consider the risky asset on the Knightian uncertain
financial market with the price fluctuation shows as continuous trajectories.
We propose the G-conditional full support condition by using uncertain
capacity, and the risky asset price path satisfying the G-conditional full
support condition could be approximated by its G-consistent asset price
systems. We derive that the bid and ask prices of the European contingent claim
against such risky asset under uncertain can be expressed by discounted of some
conditional G-expectation of the claim. We give examples, such as G-Markovian

(T-DDA) is proposed for modeling near-field radiative heat transfer in

the Discrete Dipole Approximation, except that the incident field originates
from thermal oscillations of dipoles. The T-DDA is described in details in the
paper, and the method is tested against exact results of radiative conductance
between two spheres separated by a sub-wavelength vacuum gap. For all cases
considered, the results calculated from the T-DDA are in good agreement with
those from the analytical solution. When considering frequency-independent
dielectric functions, it is observed that the number of sub-volumes required
for convergence increases as the sphere permittivity increases. Additionally,
simulations performed for two silica spheres of 0.5 micrometer-diameter show
that the resonant modes are predicted accurately via the T-DDA. For separation
gaps of 0.5 micrometer and 0.2 micrometer, the relative differences between the
T-DDA and the exact results are 0.35% and 6.4%, respectively, when 552

for two cubes of silica separated by a sub-wavelength gap. The results revealed
that faster convergence is obtained when considering cubical objects rather

the form $A X$ where $X$ is sparse, and the goal is to recover $X$. This is a
central notion in signal processing, statistics and machine learning. But in
applications such as sparse coding, edge detection, compression and super
resolution, the dictionary $A$ is unknown and has to be learned from random
examples of the form $Y = AX$ where $X$ is drawn from an appropriate
distribution --- this is the dictionary learning problem. In most settings, $A$
is overcomplete: it has more columns than rows. This paper presents a
polynomial-time algorithm for learning overcomplete dictionaries; the only
previously known algorithm with provable guarantees is the recent work of
Spielman, Wang and Wright who gave an algorithm for the full-rank case, which
is rarely the case in applications. Our algorithm applies to incoherent
dictionaries which have been a central object of study since they were
introduced in seminal work of Donoho and Huo. In particular, a dictionary is
$\mu$-incoherent if each pair of columns has inner product at most $\mu /
\sqrt{n}$.
  The algorithm makes natural stochastic assumptions about the unknown sparse
vector $X$, which can contain $k \leq c \min(\sqrt{n}/\mu \log n, m^{1/2
-\eta})$ non-zero entries (for any $\eta > 0$). This is close to the best $k$
allowable by the best sparse recovery algorithms even if one knows the
dictionary $A$ exactly. Moreover, both the running time and sample complexity
depend on $\log 1/\epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is the target accuracy, and so
our algorithms converge very quickly to the true dictionary. Our algorithm can
also tolerate substantial amounts of noise provided it is incoherent with
respect to the dictionary (e.g., Gaussian). In the noisy setting, our running
time and sample complexity depend polynomially on $1/\epsilon$, and this is
necessary.

by adjacent magnetic or adjacent time-varying electric field regions, with this
proximity (or remote) influence having a gauge origin. This is implicit
(although overlooked) in numerous works on extended systems with inhomogeneous
magnetic fields (with either conventional or Dirac materials) but is generally
plagued with an apparent gauge ambiguity. The origin of this annoying feature
is explained and it is shown how it can be theoretically removed, leading to
macroscopic quantizations (quantized Dirac monopoles, integral quantum Hall
effect, quantized magnetoelectric phenomena in topological insulators). Apart
however from serving as a theoretical probe of macroscopic quantizations, there
are cases (experimental conditions, clarified here) when this ""gauge
nonlocality"" does not really suffer from any ambiguity: an apparently innocent
gauge transformation corresponds to real change in physics of a companion
system in higher dimensionality, that leads to physical momentum transfers to
our own system. This nonlocality, together with the associated ""proximity"" or
remote effects are then real and lead to the remarkable possibility of inducing
topological phenomena from outside our system (which always remains field-free
and can even reside in simply-connected space). Specific procedures are then
proposed to experimentally detect such types of nonlocal effects and exploit
them for novel applications. General consequences in solid state physics (such
as the first violation of Bloch theorem in a field-free quantum periodic
system) are pointed out, and formal analogies with certain high energy physics
phenomena (axions, {\theta}-vacua and some types of Gribov ambiguities), as

cosmic rays (CR). Although a gamma- ray signal from the cluster volume is
expected to arise through interactions of CR protons with the ambient plasma, a
confirming observation is still missing. We search for a cumulative gamma-ray
emission in direction of galaxy clusters by analysing a collection of stacked
Fermi-LAT count maps. Additionally, we investigate possible systematic
differences in the emission between cool-core and non-cool core cluster
populations. Making use of a sample of 53 clusters selected from the HIFLUGCS
catalog, we do not detect a significant signal from the stacked sample. The
upper limit on the average flux per cluster derived for the total stacked
sample is at the level of a few 1e-11 ph cm-2 s-1 at 95% confidence level in
the 1-300 GeV band, assuming power-law spectra with photon indices 2.0, 2.4,
2.8 and 3.2. Separate stacking of the cool core and non-cool core clusters in
the sample lead to similar values of around 5e-11 ph cm-2 s-1 and 2e-11 ph cm-2
s-1, respectively. Under the assumption that decaying pi0, produced in
collisions between CRs and the ambient thermal gas, are responsible for the
gamma-ray emission, we set upper limits on the average CR content in galaxy
clusters. For the entire cluster population, our upper limit on the gamma-ray
flux translates into an upper limit on the average CR-to-thermal energy ratio
of 4.6% for a photon index of 2.4, although it is possible for individual
systems to exceed this limit. Our 95% upper limits are at the level expected
from numerical simulations, which likely suggests that the injection of CR at
cosmological shocks is less efficient than previously assumed.

in various postulated primordial binary populations, which assume that the
primordial binary fraction is higher than that in the field. We first consider
the frequency of Solar System analogues - planetary systems that form either
around a single G-dwarf star, or a binary containing a G-dwarf where the binary
separation exceeds 100-300au. If the primordial binary fraction and period
distribution is similar to that in the field, then up to 63 per cent of G-dwarf
systems could potentially host a Solar System analogue. However, if the
primordial binary fraction is higher, the fraction of G-dwarf systems that
could host a planetary system like our own is lowered to 38 per cent.
  We extend our analysis to consider the fraction of G-dwarf systems (both
single and binary) that can host either circumprimary planets (orbiting the
primary star of the binary) or circumbinary planets (orbiting both stars in the
binary) for fiducial planetary separations between 1 - 100au. Depending on the
assumed binary population, in the circumprimary case between 65 and 95 per cent
of systems can host a planet at 1au, decreasing to between 20 and 65 per cent
of systems that can host a planet at 100au. In the circumbinary case, between 5

  Our results suggest that the assumed binary fraction is the key parameter in
determining the fraction of potentially stable planetary systems in G-dwarf

overestimates if the binary fraction was initially higher.

recently models including such phases have been discussed widely, we revisit
the available constraints in the presence of mechanisms which are typically
invoked to evade flavour-changing neutral currents. To that aim, we start by
assessing the necessary calculations on the hadronic, nuclear and
atomic/molecular level, deriving expressions with conservative error estimates.
Their phenomenological analysis in the context of two-Higgs-doublet models
yields strong constraints, in some cases weakened by a cancellation mechanism
among contributions from neutral scalars. While the corresponding parameter
combinations do not yet have to be unnaturally small, the constraints are
likely to preclude large effects in other CP-violating observables.
Nevertheless, the generically expected contributions to electric dipole moments
in this class of models lie within the projected sensitivity of the
next-generation experiments.

subclass of accreting super-massive black holes with powerful relativistic
outflows directed at us. Only constituting a small fraction of the total power
output of black holes, blazars were thought to have a minor impact on the
universe at best. As we argue here, the opposite is true and the gamma-ray
emission from TeV blazars can be thermalized via beam-plasma instabilities on
cosmological scales with order unity efficiency, resulting in a potentially
dramatic heating of the low-density intergalactic medium. Here, we review this
novel heating mechanism and explore the consequences for the formation of
structure in the universe. In particular, we show how it produces an inverted
temperature-density relation of the intergalactic medium that is in agreement
with observations of the Lyman-alpha forest. This suggests that blazar heating
can potentially explain the paucity of dwarf galaxies in galactic halos and
voids, and the bimodality of galaxy clusters. This also transforms our
understanding of the evolution of blazars, their contribution to the
extra-galactic gamma-ray background, and how their individual spectra can be
used in constraining intergalactic magnetic fields.

their simple magnitude cut with weights based on source photometric redshifts
eliminates the tension between lensing and X-ray masses; in this case the weak
lensing mass estimate is actually higher than, but still in agreement with, the
dynamical estimate. A comparison of lensing analyses with and without

affected by extinction effects, it also pushes to higher SFRs. The relation we
find, M_K ~ - 2.6 log SFR, is similar to that derived previously in the optical
and at lower SFRs. It does not, however, fit the optical relation with a single
optical to NIR color conversion, suggesting systematic extinction and/or age
effects. While the relation is broadly consistent with a size-of-sample
explanation, we argue physical reasons for the relation are likely as well. In
particular, the scatter in the relation is smaller than expected from pure
random sampling strongly suggesting physical constraints. We also derive a
quantifiable relation tying together cluster-internal effects and host SFR
properties to possibly explain the observed brightest SSC magnitude vs. SFR
dependency.

strong scale dependence in the power spectra of halos, with ten percent

Fingers-of-God, FoG, effects). If unmodeled these effects prevent one from
extracting cosmological information from RSD surveys. In this paper we use
perturbation theory (PT) and halo biasing model and apply it to the
distribution function approach to RSD, in which RSD is decomposed into several
correlators of density weighted velocity moments. We model each of these
correlators using PT and compare the results to simulations over a wide range
of halo masses and redshifts. We find that with an introduction of a physically
motivated halo biasing, and using dark matter power spectra from simulations,
we can reproduce the simulation results at a percent level on scales up to
k~0.15h/Mpc at z=0, without the need to have free FoG parameters in the model.

the approach to the final state is very slow, with an inverse logarithmic
dependence on time at fixed radius. To complement these results we introduce a
numerical computation procedure that allows us to visualize the explicit form
of the evolution of the shell and of the gravitational field up to large times.
The results are in agreement with the qualitative behaviour conjectured by
Apostolatos and Thorne, with an initial damped oscillatory stage, but with
oscillations about a position that approaches slowly that of the static final

prove the existence of solutions of the cylindrical wave equation with

simulation of cloud formation by colliding flows. As in previous studies, the
forming cloud begins to undergo gravitational collapse because it rapidly
acquires a mass much larger than the average Jeans mass. Thus, the collapse
soon becomes nearly pressureless, proceeding along its shortest dimension
first. This naturally produces filaments in the cloud, and clumps within the
filaments. The filaments are not in equilibrium at any time, but instead are
long-lived flow features, through which the gas flows from the cloud to the
clumps. The filaments are long-lived because they accrete from their
environment while simultaneously accreting onto the clumps within them; they
are essentially the locus where the flow changes from accreting in two
dimensions to accreting in one dimension. Moreover, the clumps also exhibit a
hierarchical nature: the gas in a filament flows onto a main, central clump,
but other, smaller-scale clumps form along the infalling gas. Correspondingly,
the velocity along the filament exhibits a hierarchy of jumps at the locations
of the clumps. Two prominent filaments in the simulation have lengths ~15 pc,
and masses ~600 Msun above density n ~ 10^3 cm-3 (~2x10^3 Msun at n > 50 cm-3).
The density profile exhibits a central flattened core of size ~0.3 pc and an
envelope that decays as r^-2.5, in reasonable agreement with observations.
Accretion onto the filament reaches a maximum linear density rate of ~30 Msun

application in natural language processing, including machine translation,

as antipodals, complementaries, and gradable. However, existing lexicons often
do not classify opposites into the different kinds. They also do not explicitly
list word pairs that are not opposites but yet have some degree of contrast in
meaning, such as {\rm warm} and {\rm cold} or {\rm tropical} and {\rm
freezing}. We propose an automatic method to identify contrasting word pairs
that is based on the hypothesis that if a pair of words, $A$ and $B$, are
contrasting, then there is a pair of opposites, $C$ and $D$, such that $A$ and
$C$ are strongly related and $B$ and $D$ are strongly related. (For example,
there exists the pair of opposites {\rm hot} and {\rm cold} such that {\rm

key features of different kinds of opposites. We then present an automatic and
empirical measure of lexical contrast that relies on the contrast hypothesis,

water vapor condenses and droplets begin to fall; according to this term the
remaining gas moves upwards so as to conserve momentum. In the equation of
Ooyama[2001, J. Atmos. Sci. 58: 2073--2102] the reactive motion term is absent.
Both equations contain a term for condensate loading, but in the formulation of
Ooyama [2001] there are two additional terms. In some modern nonhydrostatic
models of moist atmospheric circulation, however, formulations have been mixed.
Here we examine the contrasting equations for the motion of moist air. We
discuss inconsistencies in the application of Newton's second and third laws to
an air and condensate mixture. We show that the concept of reactive motion in
this context is based on a misunderstanding of the conservation of momentum in
the presence of a gravitational field: such a reactive motion does not exist.
We show that the ""mixed"" equation used in some models is not physically
consistent either. We examine why consideration of total momentum, that is air
and condensate combined, has been misleading in the search for valid equations
of motion in the presence of phase transitions.

methods are robust when the number of possible outcomes is finite or when only
a finite number of marginals of the data-generating distribution are unknown,
they could be generically brittle when applied to continuous systems (and their
discretizations) with finite information on the data-generating distribution.
If closeness is defined in terms of the total variation metric or the matching
of a finite system of generalized moments, then (1) two practitioners who use
arbitrarily close models and observe the same (possibly arbitrarily large

robustness are antagonistic requirements and raises the question of a missing

active members of the European Broadcasting Union since 1956. The event is
televised live across Europe. Each participating country presents a song and
receive a vote based on a combination of tele-voting and jury. Over the years,
this has led to speculations of tactical voting, discriminating against some
participants and thus inducing bias in the final results. In this paper we
investigate the presence of positive or negative bias (which may roughly
indicate favouritisms or discrimination) in the votes based on geographical
proximity, migration and cultural characteristics of the participating
countries through a Bayesian hierarchical model. Our analysis found no evidence
of negative bias, although mild positive bias does seem to emerge
systematically, linking voters to performers.

of IV21 (IVC135+54-45), a galactic intermediate-velocity molecular cloud (IVMC)
that lies ~300 pc above the disk. The metallicity of IV21 was estimated using
observations toward the sdB star PG1144+615, located at a projected distance of
16 pc from the cloud's densest core, by measuring ion and HI column densities
for comparison with known solar abundances. Despite the cloud's bright FIR
emission and large column densities of molecular gas as traced by CO, we find
that it has a sub-solar metallicity of log(Z/Z_Sun)=-0.43 +/- 0.12dex. IV21 is
thus the first known sub-solar metallicity cloud in the solar neighborhood. In
contrast, most intermediate-velocity clouds (IVC) have near-solar metallicities
and are believed to originate in the Galactic Fountain. The cloud's low
metallicity is also atypical for Galactic molecular clouds, especially in the
light of the bright FIR emission which suggest a substantial dust content. The
measured I_100mu/N(HI) ratio is a factor of three below the average found in
high latitude \HI clouds within the solar neighborhood. We argue that IV21
represents the impact of an infalling, low-metallicity high-velocity cloud

robust framework capable of dealing with skewed clusters. Although dimension
reduction is increasingly in demand across many application areas, the authors

  Formation","accepted to MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stu1548",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Galaxy formation models and simulations rely on various feedback mechanisms
to reproduce the observed baryonic scaling relations and galaxy morphologies.
Although dwarf galaxy and giant elliptical properties can be explained using
feedback from supernova and active galactic nuclei, Milky Way-sized galaxies
still represent a challenge to current theories of galaxy formation. In this
paper, we explore the possible role of feedback from stellar radiation in
regulating the main properties of disk galaxies such as our own Milky Way. We
have performed a suite of cosmological simulations of the same $\sim10^{12}
{\rm M}_{\odot}$ halo selected based on its rather typical mass accretion
history. We have implemented radiative feedback from young stars using a crude
model of radiative transfer for ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) radiation.
However, the model is realistic enough such that the dust opacity plays a
direct role in regulating the efficiency of our feedback mechanism. We have
explored various models for the dust opacity, assuming different constant dust
temperatures, as well as a varying dust temperature model. We find that while
strong radiative feedback appears as a viable mechanism to regulate the stellar
mass fraction in massive galaxies, it also prevents the formation of discs with
reasonable morphologies. In models with strong stellar radiation feedback,
stellar discs are systematically too thick while the gas disc morphology is
completely destroyed due to the efficient mixing between the feedback-affected
gas and its surroundings. At the resolution of our simulation suite, we find it
impossible to preserve spiral disc morphology while at the same time expelling
enough baryons to satisfy the abundance matching constraints.

  press",,"10.1093/mnras/stt2067",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An appealing approach for studying the reionization history of the Universe
is to measure the redshift evolution of the Lyman-alpha fraction, the
percentage of Lyman-break selected galaxies that emit appreciably in the
Ly-alpha line. This fraction is expected to fall-off towards high redshift as
the intergalactic medium becomes significantly neutral, and the galaxies'
Ly-alpha emission is progressively attenuated. Intriguingly, early measurements
with this technique suggest a strong drop in the Ly-alpha fraction near z ~ 7.
Previous work concluded that this requires a surprisingly neutral intergalactic
medium -- with neutral hydrogen filling more than 50 % of the volume of the
Universe -- at this redshift. We model the evolving Ly-alpha fraction using
cosmological simulations of the reionization process. Before reionization
completes, the simulated Ly-alpha fraction has large spatial fluctuations owing
to the inhomogeneity of reionization. Since existing measurements of the
Ly-alpha fraction span relatively small regions on the sky, and sample these
regions only sparsely, they may by chance probe mostly galaxies with above
average Ly-alpha attenuation. We find that this sample variance is not
exceedingly large for existing surveys, but that it does somewhat mitigate the
required neutral fraction at z ~ 7. Quantitatively, in a fiducial model
calibrated to match measurements after reionization, we find that current z = 7
observations require a volume-averaged neutral fraction of x_HI > 0.05 at 95 %
confidence level. Hence, we find that the z ~ 7 Ly-alpha fraction measurements
do likely probe the Universe before reionization completes but that they do not
require a very large neutral fraction.

variant of the Sullivan Shadow Lemma, called Partial Shadow Lemma. This tool
allows us to prove several results on growth functions of balls and cones. One
central result is the existence of a sequence of geodesic trees with growth
rates sufficiently close to the growth rate of G, and transition points

can coexist with the CDW order, realizing the topological CDW phase. While when

statistics of photodetection, if and only if it is a coherent state. A
different and newer notion of nonclassicality is based on modal entanglement.
One example that relates these two notions is the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, where
modal entanglement is generated by a beamsplitter from the nonclassical
photon-number state. This suggests that beamsplitters or, more generally,
linear-optical networks are mediators of the two notions of nonclassicality. In
this Brief Report, we show the following: Given a nonclassical
pure-product-state input to an N-port linear-optical network, the output is
almost always mode entangled; the only exception is a product of squeezed
states, all with the same squeezing strength, input to a network that does not
mix the squeezed and anti-squeezed quadratures. Our work thus gives a necessary
and sufficient condition for a linear network to generate modal entanglement
from pure product inputs, a result that is of immediate relevance to the boson

consistently. Besides handling line blanketing in non-LTE, we show that
including forbidden line transitions of metals is increasingly important for
the temperature and ionization of the gas beyond maximum light. Non-thermal
ionization and excitation are also critical since they affect the color

GaAs/Ge/GaAs opposite semiconductor interfaces and band folding, the new design
can reduce the sizable gap in Ge and induce large spin-orbit interaction, which
lead to a topological insulator transition. Our work provides a new method on
realizing TI in commonly-used semiconductors and suggests a promising approach
to integrate it in well developed semiconductor electronic devices.

this theory, energy transfer leads to statistical correlations between thermal
fluctuations in different degrees of freedom. For long times, the energy
transfer is a multivariate diffusion process with a constant drift and
diffusion. The fluctuations and drift align in the strong-coupling limit
enabling a one-dimensional description along the coupled coordinate. We derive

employ imaging and polarimetry of microwave radiation produced as the positrons

produce radiation with opposite helicity, easily distinguishable by currently

analyze two important inclusive Standard Model Higgs decay channels,
$H\rightarrow b\bar{b}$ and $H\rightarrow gg$, up to four-loop and three-loop
levels accordingly. After PMC scale setting, it is found that the conventional

There is small residual initial scale dependence for the Higgs decay widths due
to unknown higher-order $\{\beta_i\}$-terms. Up to four-loop level, we obtain
$\Gamma(H\rightarrow b\bar{b}) = 2.389\pm0.073 \pm0.041$ MeV and up to
three-loop level, we obtain $\Gamma(H\rightarrow gg) = 0.373\pm0.030$ MeV,

error for $H\to b\bar{b}$ is caused by varying the $\overline{\rm MS}$-running

present a comparison of three BLM-based scale setting approaches, e.g. the
PMC-I approach based on the PMC-BLM correspondence, the $R_\delta$-scheme and
the seBLM approach, all of which are designed to provide effective ways to
identify non-conformal $\{\beta_i\}$-series at each perturbative order. At
four-loop level, all those approaches lead to good pQCD convergence, they have
almost the same pQCD series, and their predictions are almost independent on
the initial renormalization scale. In this sense, those approaches are
equivalent to each other.

anisotropic invariants that comprise space derivatives of OP components. It is
demonstrated that it is taking into account the latter that leads to the exact

representations at the second-order phase transition point. Analogy between

interacting regime near a Feshbach resonance. Within a self-consistent
Bogoliubov analysis we find that after the initial condensate-quasiparticle
Rabi oscillations, at long time scales the gas is characterized by a
nonequilibrium steady-state momentum distribution function, with depletion,
condensate density and contact that deviate strongly from their corresponding
equilibrium values. These are in a qualitative agreement with recent
experiments on Rb85 by Makotyn, et al. Our analysis also suggests that for
sufficiently deep quenches close to the resonance the nonequilibrium state
undergoes a phase transition to a fully depleted state, characterized by a
vanishing condensate density.

that, together with theoretical and modeling advances, are revolutionizing our
understanding of the nature of the Milky Way, and galaxy formation and
evolution in general. The formation of galaxies like the Milky Way was long
thought to be a steady process leading to a smooth distribution of stars.
However, the abundance of substructure in the multi-dimensional space of
various observables, such as position, kinematics, and metallicity, is by now
proven beyond doubt, and demonstrates the importance of mergers in the growth
of galaxies. Unlike smooth models that involve simple components, the new data
reviewed here clearly show many irregular structures, such as the Sagittarius
dwarf tidal stream and the Virgo and Pisces overdensities in the halo, and the
Monoceros stream closer to the Galactic plane. These recent developments have
made it clear that the Milky Way is a complex and dynamical structure, one that
is still being shaped by the merging of neighboring smaller galaxies. We also
briefly discuss the next generation of wide-field sky surveys, such as
SkyMapper, Pan-STARRS, Gaia and LSST, which will improve measurement precision
manyfold, and comprise billions of individual stars. The ultimate goal,
development of a coherent and detailed story of the assembly and evolutionary
history of the Milky Way and other large spirals like it, now appears well
within reach.

to the larger Mo-S force constants at the surface of thin film MoS2, which
results from a loss of neighbours in adjacent MoS2 layers. Without surface

structures, including the structure of c.e. many one degrees, the structure of
c.e. weak truth table degrees and the lattice of c.e. sets under inclusion. In
all cases we will obtain undecidability of, or even an interpretation of true
arithmetic in the theory of the structure. For the c.e. many one-degrees, we
also obtain definability results and restrictions on automorphisms.

density theorem and the Denjoy-Young-Saks theorem. For the first, we show that
a Martin-Loef random real $z\in [0,1]$ is Turing incomplete if and only if
every effectively closed class $C \subseteq [0,1]$ containing $z$ has positive
density at $z$. Under the stronger assumption that $z$ is not LR-hard, we show
that $z$ has density-one in every such class. These results have since been
applied to solve two open problems on the interaction between the Turing
degrees of Martin-Loef random reals and $K$-trivial sets: the non-cupping and
covering problems.
  We say that $f\colon[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$ satisfies the Denjoy alternative at
$z \in [0,1]$ if either the derivative $f'(z)$ exists, or the upper and lower
derivatives at $z$ are $+\infty$ and $-\infty$, respectively. The
Denjoy-Young-Saks theorem states that every function
$f\colon[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$ satisfies the Denjoy alternative at almost every
$z\in[0,1]$. We answer a question posed by Kucera in 2004 by showing that a
real $z$ is computably random if and only if every computable function $f$
satisfies the Denjoy alternative at $z$.
  For Markov computable functions, which are only defined on computable reals,
we can formulate the Denjoy alternative using pseudo-derivatives. Call a real
$z$ DA-random if every Markov computable function satisfies the Denjoy
alternative at $z$. We considerably strengthen a result of Demuth (Comment.
Math. Univ. Carolin., 24(3):391--406, 1983) by showing that every Turing
incomplete Martin-Loef random real is DA-random. The proof involves the notion
of non-porosity, a variant of density, which is the bridge between the two
themes of this paper. We finish by showing that DA-randomness is incomparable
with Martin-Loef randomness.

non-equilibrium behavior of a sheared liquid crystal via closed-loop feedback
control. Our goal is to stabilize a specific dynamical state, that is, the
stationary ""flow-alignment"", under conditions where the uncontrolled system
displays oscillatory director dynamics with in-plane symmetry. To this end we
employ time-delayed feedback control (TDFC), where the equation of motion for
the ith component, q_i(t), of the order parameter tensor is supplemented by a
control term involving the difference q_i(t)-q_i(t-\tau). In this diagonal
scheme, \tau is the delay time. We demonstrate that the TDFC method
successfully stabilizes flow alignment for suitable values of the control
strength, K, and \tau; these values are determined by solving an exact
eigenvalue equation. Moreover, our results show that only small values of K are
needed when the system is sheared from an isotropic equilibrium state, contrary
to the case where the equilibrium state is nematic.

of Characean algae, whose longitudinal flow is perhaps the most regimented of
all, hint at an autonomous process of microfilament self-organization driving
the formation of streaming patterns during morphogenesis. Working from first

motor dynamics with both micro- and macroscopic hydrodynamics to explain how
several independent processes, each ineffectual on its own, can reinforce to
ultimately develop the patterns of streaming observed in the Characeae and

between ""compact"" winds, for which the diffusion approximation is appropriate,
and ""extended"" winds, which require a more delicate treatment of the radiation.
We show that this effect is more significant than that of the light travel time
difference to a distant observer, which has a secondary influence on the light
curves of extended-wind systems. We also comment on the applicability of the
widely used flux-limited diffusion approximation in this context: we find that
it generally does not reproduce the Monte Carlo results. The flux-limited

Unlike the previous approaches, we propose to implement nonsystematic coded
transmission by scrambling the information bits, and characterize the bit error
rate of scrambled transmissions through theoretical arguments and numerical
simulations. We have focused on some examples of Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem
(BCH) and low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes to estimate the security gap,
which we have used as a measure of physical layer security, in addition to the
bit error rate. Based on a number of numerical examples, we found that such a
transmission technique can outperform alternative solutions. In fact, when an
eavesdropper (Eve) has a worse channel than the authorized user (Bob), the
security gap required to reach a given level of security is very small. The
amount of degradation of Eve's channel with respect to Bob's that is needed to
achieve sufficient security can be further reduced by implementing scrambling
and descrambling operations on blocks of frames, rather than on single frames.
While Eve's channel has a quality equal to or better than that of Bob's
channel, we have shown that the use of a hybrid automatic repeat-request (HARQ)
protocol with authentication still allows achieving a sufficient level of
security. Finally, the secrecy performance of some practical schemes has also
been measured in terms of the equivocation rate about the message at the
eavesdropper and compared with that of ideal codes.

construct a QKD protocol which retains its security even if the source of
randomness used by communicating parties is strongly biased. As a proof of
principle, an explicit example of a protocol based on the Hardy's paradox is
presented. Moreover, in the noiseless case, the protocol is secure in a natural
way against any type of memory attack, and thus allows to reuse the device in
subsequent rounds. We also analyse the robustness of the protocol using
semi-definite programming methods. Finally, we present a post-processing
method, and observe a paradoxical property that rejecting some random part of

  In the framework of the Virtual Observatory, the German Astrophysical Virtual

to stellar spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and is intended to ingest SEDs
calculated by any model-atmosphere code. In case of the DA white dwarf G
191-B2B, we demonstrate that the model reproduces not only its overall
continuum shape but also the numerous metal lines exhibited in its ultraviolet
spectrum.
  TheoSSA is in operation and contains presently a variety of SEDs for DA white
dwarfs. It will be extended in the near future and can host SEDs of all primary
and secondary flux standards. The spectral analysis of G 191-B2B has shown that
our hydrostatic models reproduce the observations best at an effective
temperature of 60000 +/- 2000K and a surface gravity of log g = 7.60 +/- 0.05.
We newly identified Fe VI, Ni VI, and Zn IV lines. For the first time, we
determined the photospheric zinc abundance with a logarithmic mass fraction of
-4.89 (7.5 times solar). The abundances of He (upper limit), C, N, O, Al, Si,
O, P, S, Fe, Ni, Ge, and Sn were precisely determined. Upper abundance limits
of 10% solar were derived for Ti, Cr, Mn, and Co.
  The TheoSSA database of theoretical SEDs of stellar flux standards guarantees
that the flux calibration of all astronomical data and cross-calibration
between different instruments can be based on the same models and SEDs
calculated with different model-atmosphere codes and are easy to compare.

comprising thin metal films with adjustable adhesion were fabricated. The
Cu/Ag/Ti/Si structures were grown on Si substrates and include thin Ti and Ag
films and a thick Cu layer. The Ag and Ti films were deposited on the Si
substrate under vacuum, and a thick Cu layer was subsequently electroplated
onto the Ag surface. Later, the sandwich was separated and a vacuum nanogap was
opened to produce two Ag/Cu and Ti/Si conformal electrodes. The adhesion
strength between the Ti and Ag films was precisely adjusted by exposing the
structures to dry O2 after Ti growth but before Ag growth. The resulting
adhesion needed to be sufficiently high to allow electroplating of Cu and
sufficiently low to allow subsequent separation. Either heating or cooling was
used to separate the sandwiches. T he structures separated as a result of the
different thermal expansion parameters of the Si and Cu electrodes and the low
adhesion between the Ti and Ag layers. After separation, the Ag and Ti surfaces
were analyzed optically using a Michelson interferometer. Adhesion regulation
and optimization of the electroplating regime allowed fabrication of two
conformal electrodes with a nanogap smaller than 5 nm and an area larger than 7
mm2. Such electrodes can be used for efficient energy conversion and cooling in
the mixed thermionic and thermotunneling regime.

dynamical state of the HR 8799 system is not yet fully resolved, due to limited
astrometric data covering tiny orbital arcs. We construct a new, orbital model
of the HR 8799 system, assuming rapid migration of the planets after their
formation in wider orbits. We found that the HR 8799 planets are likely
involved in double Laplace resonance, 1e:2d:4c:8b MMR. Quasi-circular planetary
orbits are coplanar with the stellar equator and inclined by ~25 degrees to the
sky plane. This best-fit orbital configuration matches astrometry, debris disk
models, and mass estimates from cooling models. The multiple MMR is stable for
the age of the star ~160Myr, for at least 1 Gyr unless significant

is modelled as a sum of two or more sinusoidal harmonics with idependent
frequencies. It is useful in the cases when the data may contain several
periodic components, especially when their interaction with each other and with
the data sampling patterns might produce misleading results.
  Although the multi-frequency statistic itself was already constructed, e.g.
by G. Foster in his CLEANest algorithm, its probabilistic properties (the
detection significance levels) are still poorly known and much of what is
deemed known is unrigourous. These detection levels are nonetheless important
for the data analysis. We argue that to prove the simultaneous existence of all
$n$ components revealed in a multi-periodic variation, it is mandatory to apply
at least $2^n-1$ significance tests, among which the most involves various
multi-frequency statistics, and only $n$ tests are single-frequency ones.
  The main result of the paper is an analytic estimation of the statistical
significance of the frequency tuples that the multi-frequency periodogram can
reveal. Using the theory of extreme values of random fields (the generalized
Rice method), we find a handy approximation to the relevant false alarm
probability. For the double-frequency periodogram this approximation is given
by an elementary formula $\frac{\pi}{16} W^2 e^{-z} z^2$, where $W$ stands for
a normalized width of the settled frequency range, and $z$ is the observed
periodogram maximum. We carried out intensive Monte Carlo simulations to show
that the practical quality of this approximation is satisfactory. A similar
analytic expression for the general multi-frequency periodogram is also given
in the paper, though with a smaller amount of numerical verification.

interactions between surfaces near contact only insufficiently. For spheres, it
is common practice to account for surface-normal lubrication forces by means of
an explicit correction term. A method that additionally covers all further
singular interactions for spheres is present in the literature as well as a
link-based approach that allows for more general shapes but does not capture
non-normal interactions correctly. In this paper, lattice-independent
lubrication corrections for aspherical particles are outlined, taking into
account all leading divergent interaction terms. An efficient implementation
for arbitrary spheroids is presented and compared to purely normal and
link-based models. Good consistency with Stokesian dynamics simulations of
spheres is found. The non-normal interactions affect the viscosity of
suspensions of spheres at volume fractions \Phi >= 0.3 but already at \Phi >=
0.2 for spheroids. Regarding shear-induced diffusion of spheres, a distinct
effect is found at 0.1 <= \Phi <= 0.5 and even increasing the resolution of the

and Section S4 here. It discusses corrections to galaxy and BH parameters, most
importantly to 2MASS K-band apparent magnitudes. It presents evidence that
corrections are needed because 2MASS misses light at large radii when the
images of galaxies subtend large angles on the sky or have shallow outer
brightness gradients. Section S4 reproduces essentially verbatim the first part
of Section 5 in the main paper, the BH database. It includes the list of BH and
host-galaxy properties (Tables 2 and 3). Its most important purpose is to
provide all of the notes on individual objects.

Discovery of a light Higgs boson, coupled with lack of evidence for
supersymmetry at the LHC so far, has motivated studies of supersymmetry in the
context of naturalness with the principal focus being the third generation
squarks. In this work, we analyze the prospects of the flavor violating decay
mode $\rm \tilde{t}_1\to c\chi_{1}^{0}$ at 8 and 13 TeV center of mass energy
at the LHC. This channel is also relevant in the dark matter context for the
stop-coannihilation scenario, where the relic density depends on the mass
difference between the lighter stop quark ($\tilde{t}_1$) and the lightest
neutralino($\chi_{1}^{0}$) states. This channel is extremely challenging to
probe, specially for situations when the mass difference between the lighter
stop quark and the lightest neutralino is small. Using certain kinematical
properties of signal events we find that the level of backgrounds can be
reduced substantially. We find that the prospect for this channel is limited
due to the low production cross section for top squarks and limited luminosity
at 8 TeV, but at the 13 TeV LHC with 100 $fb^{-1}$ luminosity, it is possible
to probe top squarks with masses up to $\sim$ 450 GeV. We also discuss how the
sensitivity could be significantly improved by tagging charm jets.

as true equivalents of Class 0 protostars in the high-mass regime. The
remaining core has only a tentative outflow detection. It could be amongst the
first examples of a true individual high-mass prestellar core. We find that the
momentum flux of high-mass objects has a linear relation to the envelope mass,
as a scale-up of the relations found for low-mass protostars. This suggests a
fundamental proportionality between accretion rates and mass reservoir,
suggesting identical collapse timescales for all masses. We conclude that if
the pre-collapse evolution is quasi-static, the fragmentation scale (which is
similar for all masses) would limit the size of the initial mass reservoirs,
leading to shorter free-fall times for higher mass stars. However, as we find
identical collapse timescales for all masses, a significant turbulent/magnetic
support is needed to slow down the collapse of the more massive envelopes in a
quasi-static view. With this support still to be discovered, and with
indications of large dynamics in pre-collapse gas for high-mass star formation,
we propose that such an identical collapse timescale implies that the initial
densities, which should set the duration of the collapse, should be similar for
all masses. This suggests that the mass that incorporates massive stars has to
have been accreted in a dynamical way from larger scales than those of low-mass
stars.

is difficult to investigate such a scenario at collider experiments, the
measurement of the hadronic electric dipole moments is one of promising ways to
detect the effects of the SUSY particles. These effects are expressed in terms
of the CP-violating effective operators defined at the SUSY breaking scale,

the QCD corrections to the effective operators in the high-scale SUSY scenario.
To appropriately evaluate the radiative corrections in the presence of large
mass hierarchy among the SUSY particles, we exploit an effective theoretical
approach based on the renormalization-group equations. As a result, it is found
that the low-energy quark electric and chromoelectric dipole moments may differ

recently proposed that we focus instead on the spectrum of the non-backtracking

behavior in the sparse limit. Inspired by this suggestion, we here make use of
a relaxation method to derive a spectral community detection algorithm that
works well even in the sparse regime where other methods break down.
Interestingly, however, the matrix at the heart of the method, it turns out, is
not exactly the non-backtracking matrix, but a variant of it with a somewhat
different definition. We study the behavior of this variant matrix for both
artificial and real-world networks and find it to have desirable properties,
especially in the common case of networks with broad degree distributions, for
which it appears to have a better behaved spectrum and eigenvectors than the
original non-backtracking matrix.

function may approximate the overall galaxy structure, it does not entirely
capture the light distribution of two-thirds of our galaxies, for which
multi-component models provide a better fit. This fraction of complex galaxies
shows a strong dependence on luminosity, being larger for brighter objects. We
analyze the global and component-specific photometric scaling relations of
early-type dwarf galaxies and discuss similarities with bright early and late
types. The dwarfs' global galaxy parameters show scaling relations that are
similar to those of bright disk galaxies. The inner components are mostly
fitted with S\'ersic n values close to 1. At a given magnitude they are
systematically larger than the bulges of spirals, suggesting that they are not
ordinary bulges. We argue that the multi-component structures in early-type
dwarfs are mostly a phenomenon inherent to the disks, and may indeed stem from
environmental processing.

of the large-scale structure of the universe, its matter and energy content and
its evolution. These surveys necessitate the determination of the galaxy
redshifts using photometric techniques (photo-z). Oftentimes, it is
advantageous to remove from the galaxy sample those for which one suspects that
the photo-z estimation might be unreliable. In this paper, we show that
applying these photo-z quality cuts blindly can grossly bias the measured
galaxy correlations within and across photometric redshift bins. We then extend
the work of Ho et al. (2012) and Ross et al. (2011) to develop a simple and
effective method to correct for this using the data themselves. Finally, we
apply the method to the Mega-Z catalog, containing about a million luminous red
galaxies in the redshift range 0.45 < z < 0.65. After splitting the sample into
four \Delta z = 0.05 photo-z bins using the BPZ algorithm, we see how our
corrections bring the measured galaxy auto- and cross-correlations into
agreement with expectations. We then look for the BAO feature in the four bins,
with and without applying the photo-z quality cuts, and find a broad agreement
between the BAO scales extracted in both cases. Intriguingly, we observe a
correlation between galaxy density and photo-z quality even before any photo-z
quality cuts are applied. This may be due to uncorrected observational effects
that result in correlated gradients across the sky of the galaxy density and
the galaxy photo-z precision. Our correction procedure could also help to
mitigate some of these systematic effects.

evolutions are studied separately, with N-body and statistical codes,
respectively, because of stringent computational constraints. We present here
LIDT-DD, the first code able to mix both approaches in a fully self-consistent
way. Our aim is for it to be generic enough so as to be applied to any
astrophysical cases where we expect dynamics and collisions to be deeply
interlocked with one another: planets in discs, violent massive breakups,
destabilized planetesimal belts, exozodiacal discs, etc. The code takes its
basic architecture from the LIDT3D algorithm developed by Charnoz et al.(2012)
for protoplanetary discs, but has been strongly modified and updated in order
to handle the very constraining specificities of debris discs physics:
high-velocity fragmenting collisions, radiation-pressure affected orbits,
absence of gas, etc. In LIDT-DD, grains of a given size at a given location in
a disc are grouped into ""super-particles"", whose orbits are evolved with an
N-body code and whose mutual collisions are individually tracked and treated
using a particle-in-a-box prescription. To cope with the wide range of possible
dynamics, tracers are sorted and regrouped into dynamical families depending on
their orbits. The code retrieves the classical features known for debris discs,
such as the particle size distributions in unperturbed discs, the outer radial
density profiles (slope in -1.5) outside narrow collisionally active rings, and
the depletion of small grains in ""dynamically cold"" discs. The potential of the
new code is illustrated with the test case of the violent breakup of a massive
planetesimal within a debris disc. The main potential future applications of
the code are planet/disc interactions, and more generally any configurations
where dynamics and collisions are expected to be intricately connected.

different situations. It is concluded that these models represent accelerated

statistics which try to violate Bell type inequalities via classical, common
cause correlations. The Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality is very
robust. However, we argue that with the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen setup, the CHSH
is inferior to the Bell inequality, although and because the latter must assume
anti-correlation of entangled photon singlet states. We simulate how often
quantum behavior violates both inequalities, depending on the number of
photons. Violating Bell 99% of the time is argued to be an ideal benchmark. We
present hidden variables that violate the Bell and CHSH inequalities with 50%
probability, and ones which violate Bell 85% of the time when missing 13%
anti-correlation. We discuss how to present the quantum correlations to a wide
audience and conclude that, when defending against claims of hidden
classicality, one should demand numerical simulations and insist on
anti-correlation and the full amount of Bell violation. This preprint version
adds a section on realisms and shows the actual programs with output.

  4657--4669, 2012",,,"physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The congruential rule advanced by Graves for polarization basis
transformation of the radar backscatter matrix is now often misinterpreted as
an example of consimilarity transformation. However, consimilarity
transformations imply a physically unrealistic antilinear time-reversal
operation. This is just one of the approaches found in literature to the
description of transformations where the role of conjugation has been
misunderstood. In this paper, the different approaches are examined in
particular in respect to the role of conjugation. In order to justify and
correctly derive the congruential rule for polarization basis transformation
and properly place the role of conjugation, the origin of the problem is traced
back to the derivation of the antenna hight from the transmitted field. In
fact, careful consideration of the role played by the Green's dyadic operator
relating the antenna height to the transmitted field shows that, under general
unitary basis transformation, it is not justified to assume a scalar
relationship between them. Invariance of the voltage equation shows that
antenna states and wave states must in fact lie in dual spaces, a distinction
not captured in conventional Jones vector formalism. Introducing spinor
formalism, and with the use of an alternate spin frame for the transmitted
field a mathematically consistent implementation of the directional wave
formalism is obtained. Examples are given comparing the wider generality of the
congruential rule in both active and passive transformations with the
consimilarity rule.

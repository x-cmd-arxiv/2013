thirties. It has a prevalence that ranges between 2 and 150 per 100 000.
Epidemiological studies of MS have provided hints on possible causes for the
disease ranging from genetic, environmental and infectious factors to other
factors of vascular origin. Despite the tremendous effort spent in the last few
years, none of the hypotheses formulated so far has gained wide acceptance and
the causes of the disease remain unknown. From a clinical point of view, a high
correlation has been recently observed between MS and Chronic Cerebro-Spinal
Venous Insufficiency (CCSVI) in a statistically significant number of patients.
In this pathological situation CCSVI may induce alterations of blood pressure
in brain microvessels, thereby perturbing the exchange of small hydrophilic
molecules between the blood and the external cells. In the presence of large
pressure alterations it cannot be excluded also the leakage of macromolecules
that otherwise would not cross the vessel wall. All these disorders may trigger
immune defenses with the destruction of myelin as a side effect. In the present
work we investigate the role of perturbed blood pressure in brain microvessels
as driving force for an altered exchange of small hydrophilic solutes and
leakage of macromolecules into the interstitial fluid. With a simplified, yet
realistic, model we obtain closed-form steady-state solutions for fluid flow
and solute transport across the microvessel wall. Finally, we use these results
(i) to interpret experimental data available in the literature and (ii) to
carry out a preliminary analysis of the disorder in the exchange processes
triggered by an increase of blood pressure, thereby relating our preliminary
results to the hypothesised vascular connection to MS.

defined by longitudinal and transverse trap frequencies and corresponding trap
energy heights. The battery's ability to supply power to a load is evaluated as
a function of an input atom flux and power. For given trap parameters and input
flux the battery is shown to have a resonantly optimum value of input power.
The battery behavior can be cast in terms of an equivalent circuit model;
specifically, for fixed input flux and power the battery is modeled in terms of
a Th\'{e}venin equivalent chemical potential and internal resistance. The
internal resistance establishes the maximum power that can be supplied to a
circuit, the heat that will be generated by the battery, and that noise will be
imposed on the circuit. We argue that any means of implementing a battery for
atomtronics can be represented by a Th\'{e}venin equivalent and that its
performance will likewise be determined by an internal resistance.

the allowed parameter space in the constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard

minimizing the chi^2 function with respect to all known constraints from
accelerators and cosmology using GUT scale parameters. For the CMSSM the Higgs
boson mass at tree level is below the Z^0 boson mass and large radiative
corrections are needed to obtain a Higgs boson mass of 126 GeV, which requires
stop squark masses in the multi-TeV range. In contrast, for the NMSSM light
stop quarks are allowed, since in the NMSSM at tree level the Higgs boson mass
can be above the Z^0 boson mass from mixing with the additional singlet Higgs
boson. Predictions for the scalar boson masses are given in both models with
emphasis on the unique signatures of the NMSSM, where the heaviest scalar Higgs
boson decays in the two lighter scalar Higgs bosons with a significant
branching ratio, in which case one should observe double Higgs boson production
at the LHC. Such a signal is strongly suppressed in the CMSSM. In addition,
since the LSP is higgsino-like, Higgs boson decays into LSPs can be
appreciable, thus leading to invisible Higgs decays.

of polymeric and wormlike micellar surfactant fluids, focussing on the
protocols of step shear stress, step shear strain (or in practice a rapid
strain ramp), and shear startup, which are commonly studied experimentally. For
each protocol we perform a linear stability analysis to provide a
fluid-universal criterion for the onset of shear banding, following our recent
Letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 110 (2013) 086001]. In each case this criterion
depends only on the shape of the experimentally measured rheological response
function for that protocol, independent of the constitutive properties of the
material in question. (Therefore our criteria in fact concern all complex
fluids and not just the polymeric ones of interest here. A separate manuscript
[in preparation] will explore them in a broad class of disordered soft glassy
materials including foams, dense emulsions, dense colloids, and microgel bead
suspensions.) An important prediction is that pronounced banding can arise
transiently in each of these protocols, even in fluids for which the underlying
constitutive curve of stress as a function of strain-rate is monotonic and a
steadily flowing state is accordingly unbanded. For each protocol we provide
numerical results in the rolie-poly and Giesekus models that support our
predictions. We comment on the ability of the rolie-poly model to capture the
observed experimental phenomenology, and on the failure of the Giesekus model.

ascertained by seismic data, and the dynamics are solved numerically. The time
taken to fall along the diameter is found to be 38 rather than 42 minutes. The
time taken to fall along a straight line between any two points is no longer

tends to reach a greater maximum depth and takes less time to traverse.
Although the assumption of uniform density works well in many cases, the
simpler assumption of a constant gravitational field serves as a better

combine these two sources of information? Using a robot to move participant's
passive limbs, we performed psychophysical estimates of proprioceptive function
for each limb independently, and again when subjects grasped the robot handle

several models from the sensory integration literature: some that propose a
combination of signals from the left and right arms (such as a Bayesian
maximum-likelihood estimate), and some that propose using unimanual signals
alone. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the nervous system
both has knowledge of, and uses the limb with the best proprioceptive acuity
for bimanual proprioception. Surprisingly, a Bayesian model that postulates
optimal combination of sensory signals could not predict empirically observed
bimanual acuity. These findings suggest that while the central nervous system

Estimators - a new algorithm to generate density reconstructions in three
dimensions from photometric weak lensing measurements. This is an extension of
earlier work in one dimension aimed at applying compressive sensing theory to
the inversion of gravitational lensing measurements to recover 3D density maps.
Using the assumption that the density can be represented sparsely in our chosen
basis - 2D transverse wavelets and 1D line of sight dirac functions - we show
that clusters of galaxies can be identified and accurately localised and
characterised using this method. Throughout, we use simulated data consistent
with the quality currently attainable in large surveys. We present a thorough
statistical analysis of the errors and biases in both the redshifts of detected
structures and their amplitudes. The GLIMPSE method is able to produce
reconstructions at significantly higher resolution than the input data; in this
paper we show reconstructions with 6x finer redshift resolution than the shear
data. Considering cluster simulations with 0.05 <= z <= 0.75 and 3e13/h Msun <=
Mvir <= 1e15/h Msun, we show that the redshift extent of detected peaks is
typically 1-2 pixels, or Dz <~ 0.07, and that we are able to recover an
unbiased estimator of the redshift of a detected cluster by considering many
realisations of the noise. We also recover an accurate estimator of the mass,
that is largely unbiased when the redshift is known, and whose bias is
constrained to <~ 5% in the majority of our simulations when the estimated
redshift is taken to be the true redshift. This shows a substantial improvement
over earlier 3D inversion methods, which showed redshift smearing with a
typical standard deviation of 0.2-0.3, a significant damping of the amplitude
of the peaks detected, and a bias in the detected redshift.

differential equation and the hyperbolic part is approximated by a finite
volume scheme. Bounded variation stability has been studied. Due to yield loss,
proposed scheme is total variation bounded. The convergence of the numerical
solution towards entropy solution (in the Kruzkov sense) is proved. Numerical
experiments are presented to demonstrate the performance of the scheme.

dependence of DC magnetization at high magnetic fields is measured for
different concentrations of Cu and Mn. Detailed analysis based on the
Curie-Weiss law indicates that the Cu doping weakens the average magnetic
moments, while doping Mn enhances the local magnetic moments greatly,
suggesting that the former may be non- or very weak magnetic impurities, and
the latter give rise to magnetic impurities. However, it is found that both
doping Cu and Mn will enhance the residual resistivity and suppress the
superconductivity at the same rate in the low doping region, being consistent
with the prediction of the S$^{\pm}$ model. For the Cu-doped system, the
superconductivity is suppressed completely at a residual resistivity $\rho_0$ =
0.87 m$\Omega$ cm at which a strong localization effect is observed. However,
in the case of Mn doping, the behavior of suppression to \emph{T}$_{c}$ changes
from a fast speed to a slow one and keeps superconductive even up to a residual
resistivity of 2.86 m$\Omega$ cm. Clearly the magnetic Mn impurities are even
not as detrimental as the non- or very weak magnetic Cu impurities to
superconductivity in the high doping regime.

  Rio De Janeiro, 2013",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent cosmic-ray measurements by the ATIC, CREAM and PAMELA experiments have
found an apparent hardening of the energy spectrum at TeV energies. Although
the origin of the hardening is not clearly understood, possible explanations
include hardening in the cosmic-ray source spectrum, changes in the cosmic-ray
propagation properties in the Galaxy and the effect of nearby sources. In this
contribution, we propose that the spectral anomaly might be an effect of
re-acceleration of cosmic rays by weak shocks in the Galaxy. After acceleration
by strong supernova remnant shock waves, cosmic rays undergo diffusive
propagation through the Galaxy. During the propagation, cosmic rays may again
encounter expanding supernova remnant shock waves, and get re-accelerated. As
the probability of encountering old supernova remnants is expected to be larger
than the young ones due to their bigger size, re-acceleration is expected to be
produced mainly by weaker shocks. Since weaker shocks generate a softer
particle spectrum, the resulting re-accelerated component will have a spectrum
steeper than the initial cosmic-ray source spectrum produced by strong shocks.
For a reasonable set of model parameters, it is shown that such re-accelerated
component can dominate the GeV energy region while the non-reaccelerated
component dominates at higher energies, explaining the observed GeV-TeV
spectral anomaly.

width and the transmission profile of the narrow-band filters used for
extracting LAE candidates at redshifts z ~ 6.5 through Monte Carlo simulations,
and we present pilot observations to test the performance of tunable filters to
find LAEs and other emission-line candidates. We compare the samples obtained
using a narrow ideal-rectangular-filter, the Subaru NB921 narrow-band filter,
and sweeping across a wavelength range using the ultra-narrow-band tunable
filters of the instrument OSIRIS, installed at the 10.4m Gran Telescopio
Canarias. We use this instrument for extracting LAE candidates from a small set
of real observations. Broad-band data from the Subaru, HST and Spitzer
databases were used for fiting SEDs to calculate photometric redshifts and to
identify interlopers. Narrow-band surveys are very efficient to find LAEs in
large sky areas, but the samples obtained are not evenly distributed in
redshift along the filter bandpass, and the number of LAEs with equivalent
widths < 60 angstroms can be underestimated. These biased results do not appear
in samples obtained using ultra-narrow-band tunable filters. However, the field
size of tunable filters is restricted because of the variation of the effective
wavelength across the image. Thus narrow-band and ultra-narrow-band surveys are
complementary strategies to investigate high-redshift LAEs.

solely by a non-Abelian gauge field thanks to a specific higher order
derivative operator. The nature of the operator is such that it does not
introduce ghosts. We compute the cosmological scalar and tensor perturbations
for this model, improving over an existing computation. We then confront these
results with the Planck data. The model is characterized by the quantity \gamma
= (g^2 Q^2)/H^2 (where g is the gauge coupling constant, Q the vector vev, and
H the Hubble rate). For \gamma < 2, the scalar perturbations show a strong
tachyonic instability. In the stable region, the scalar power spectrum n_s is
too low at small \gamma, while the tensor-to-scalar ratio r is too high at
large \gamma. No value of \gamma leads to acceptable values for n_s and r, and
so the model is ruled out by the CMB data. The same behavior with \gamma was
obtained in Chromo-natural inflation, a model in which inflation is driven by a
pseudo-scalar coupled to a non-Abelian gauge field. When the pseudo-scalar can
be integrated out, one recovers the model of Gauge-flation plus corrections. It
was shown that this identification is very accurate at the background level,
but differences emerged in the literature concerning the perturbations of the
two models. On the contrary, our results show that the analogy between the two
models continues to be accurate also at the perturbative level.

identified so far are fainter than 17.4 in the V band and, thus, are poor
candidates for an in-depth follow-up with asteroseismology. We therefore
obtained high S/N light curves and spectroscopy for a number of field sdO stars
to attempt to discover bright counterparts to these stars, particularly the
Omega Cen pulsators. Our primary sample consisted of 19 sdO stars with
hydrogen-rich atmospheres, log N(He)/N(H) < -1.0, effective temperatures in the
range 40,000 K < Teff < 67,000 K, and surface gravities 5.3 < log g < 6.1. We
also observed 17 additional helium-rich sdO stars with log N(He)/N(H) > -0.1
and similar temperatures and gravities. To date, we have found no detectable
pulsations at amplitudes above 0.08% (4 times the mean noise level) in any of
the 36 field sdO stars that we observed. The presence of pulsations in Omega
Cen sdO stars and their apparent absence in seemingly comparable field sdO
stars is perplexing. While very suggestive, the significance of this result is
difficult to assess more completely right now due to remaining uncertainties
about the temperature width and purity of the Omega Cen instability strip and
the existence of any sdO pulsators with weaker amplitudes than the current

developing to predict the contribution of TP-AGB stars, that should dominate
the NIR spectra of populations 0.3 to 2 Gyr old. When present in a given
stellar population, these stars leave unique signatures that can be used to
detect them unambiguously. However, these models have to be tested in a
homogeneous database of star-forming galaxies, to check if the results are
consistent with what is found from different wavelength ranges. In this work we
performed stellar population synthesis on the nuclear and extended regions of
23 star-forming galaxies to understand how the star-formation tracers in the
near-infrared can be used in practice. The stellar population synthesis shows
that for the galaxies with strong emission in the NIR, there is an important
fraction of young/intermediate population contributing to the spectra, which is
probably the ionisation source in these galaxies. Galaxies that had no emission
lines measured in the NIR were found to have older average ages and less
contribution of young populations. Although the stellar population synthesis
method proved to be very effective to find the young ionising population in
these galaxies, no clear correlation between these results and the NIR spectral
indexes were found. Thus, we believe that, in practice, the use of these
indexes is still very limited due to observational limitations.

there are multiple buyers (advertisers), and items (slots) that are arranged in
a line such as a banner on a website. Each buyer desires a particular number of
{\em consecutive} slots and has a per-unit-quality value $v_i$ (dependent on
the ad only) while each slot $j$ has a quality $q_j$ (dependent on the position
only such as click-through rate in position auctions). Hence, the valuation of
the buyer $i$ for item $j$ is $v_iq_j$. We want to decide the allocations and
the prices in order to maximize the total revenue of the market maker.
  A key difference from the traditional position auction is the advertiser's
requirement of a fixed number of consecutive slots. Consecutive slots may be
needed for a large size rich media ad. We study three major pricing mechanisms,
the Bayesian pricing model, the maximum revenue market equilibrium model and an
envy-free solution model. Under the Bayesian model, we design a polynomial time
computable truthful mechanism which is optimum in revenue. For the market
equilibrium paradigm, we find a polynomial time algorithm to obtain the maximum
revenue market equilibrium solution. In envy-free settings, an optimal solution
is presented when the buyers have the same demand for the number of consecutive
slots. We conduct a simulation that compares the revenues from the above
schemes and gives convincing results.

$d$ corresponding to the setting of $d$ binary attributes. A $k$-way marginal
query is specified by a subset $S$ of $k$ attributes, and a $|S|$-dimensional
binary vector $\beta$ specifying their values. The result for this query is a
count of the number of people in the database whose attribute vector restricted
to $S$ agrees with $\beta$.
  Privately releasing approximate answers to a set of $k$-way marginal queries
is one of the most important and well-motivated problems in differential
privacy. Information theoretically, the error complexity of marginal queries is
well-understood: the per-query additive error is known to be at least
$\Omega(\min\{\sqrt{n},d^{\frac{k}{2}}\})$ and at most
$\tilde{O}(\min\{\sqrt{n} d^{1/4},d^{\frac{k}{2}}\})$. However, no polynomial
time algorithm with error complexity as low as the information theoretic upper
bound is known for small $n$. In this work we present a polynomial time
algorithm that, for any distribution on marginal queries, achieves average
error at most $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n} d^{\frac{\lceil k/2 \rceil}{4}})$. This error
bound is as good as the best known information theoretic upper bounds for
$k=2$. This bound is an improvement over previous work on efficiently releasing
marginals when $k$ is small and when error $o(n)$ is desirable. Using private
boosting we are also able to give nearly matching worst-case error bounds.
  Our algorithms are based on the geometric techniques of Nikolov, Talwar, and
Zhang. The main new ingredients are convex relaxations and careful use of the
Frank-Wolfe algorithm for constrained convex minimization. To design our
relaxations, we rely on the Grothendieck inequality from functional analysis.

operating on the raw-data level, the noise of the quantum channel can be
corrected in the low-dimensional (scalar) space and the reconciliation can be
extended to arbitrary dimensions. The CVQKD systems allow an unconditionally
secret communication over standard telecommunication networks. To exploit the
real potential of CVQKD a robust reconciliation technique is needed. It is
currently unavailable, which makes it impossible to reach the real performance
of the CVQKD protocols. The reconciliation is a post-processing step separated
from the transmission of quantum states, which is aimed to derive the secret
key from the raw data. The reconciliation process of correlated Gaussian
variables is a complex problem that requires either tomography in the physical
layer that is intractable in a practical scenario, or high-cost calculations in
the multidimensional spherical space with strict dimensional limitations. To
avoid these issues we define the low-dimensional reconciliation. We prove that
the error probability of one-dimensional reconciliation is zero in any
practical CVQKD scenario, and provides unconditional security. The results
allow to significantly improve the currently available key rates and

approximations in the auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) method. These
approaches can provide significant computational savings compared to fully
correlating all the electrons. While the many-body wave function is never
explicit in AFQMC, its random walkers are Slater determinants, whose orbitals
may be expressed in terms of any one-particle orbital basis. It is therefore
straightforward to partition the full N-particle Hilbert space into active and
inactive parts to implement the frozen-orbital method. In the frozen-core
approximation, for example, the core electrons can be eliminated in the
correlated part of the calculations, greatly increasing the computational
efficiency, especially for heavy atoms. Scalar relativistic effects are easily
included using the Douglas-Kroll-Hess theory. Using this method, we obtain a
way to effectively eliminate the error due to single-projector, norm-conserving
pseudopotentials in AFQMC. We also illustrate a generalization of the
frozen-orbital approach that downfolds high-energy basis states to a physically
relevant low-energy sector, which allows a systematic approach to produce
realistic model Hamiltonians to further increase efficiency for extended

cost homomorphism problem (Min-Cost-Hom) as a function of a constraint
language, i.e. a set of constraint relations and cost functions that are
allowed to appear in instances. A wide range of natural combinatorial
optimisation problems can be expressed as Min-Cost-Homs and a classification of
their complexity would be highly desirable, both from a direct, applied point
of view as well as from a theoretical perspective.
  Min-Cost-Hom can be understood either as a flexible optimisation version of
the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) or a restriction of the
(general-valued) valued constraint satisfaction problem (VCSP). Other
optimisation versions of CSPs such as the minimum solution problem (Min-Sol)
and the minimum ones problem (Min-Ones) are special cases of Min-Cost-Hom.
  The study of VCSPs has recently seen remarkable progress. A complete
classification for the complexity of finite-valued languages on arbitrary
finite domains has been obtained Thapper and Zivny [STOC'13]. However,
understanding the complexity of languages that are not finite-valued appears to
be more difficult. Min-Cost-Hom allows us to study problematic languages of
this type without having to deal with with the full generality of the VCSP. A
recent classification for the complexity of three-element Min-Sol, Uppman

it disappears at doping x = 0.02. Further doping of La_2-xAe_xCuO4 gives rise
to incommensurate free-hole density waves whose wavelength is determined by the

be a systematic effect for systems composed of binary black holes, with the
disagreement increasing with total mass. In some cases, the MCMC search

dwarf galaxies (UCDs) are about 50% higher than predicted by stellar population
models. AIMS: Here we investigate the possibility that these elevated M/L
ratios are caused by a central black hole (BH), heating up the internal motion
of stars. We focus on a sample of ~50 extragalactic UCDs for which velocity
dispersions and structural parameters have been measured. METHODS: Using
up-to-date distance moduli and a consistent treatment of aperture and seeing
effects, we calculate the ratio Psi=(M/L)_{dyn}/(M/L)_{pop} between the
dynamical and the stellar population M/L of UCDs. For all UCDs with Psi>1 we
estimate the mass of a hypothetical central BH needed to reproduce the observed
integrated velocity dispersion. RESULTS: Massive UCDs (M>10^7 M_*) have an
average Psi = 1.7 +-0.2, implying notable amounts of dark mass in them. We find
that, on average, central BH masses of 10-15% of the UCD mass can explain these
elevated dynamical M/L ratios. The implied BH masses in UCDs range from several
10^5 M_* to several 10^7 M_*. In the M_BH-Luminosity plane, UCDs are offset by
about two orders of magnitude in luminosity from the relation derived for
galaxies. Our findings can be interpreted such that massive UCDs originate from
progenitor galaxies with masses around 10^9 M_*, and that those progenitors
have SMBH occupation fractions of 60-100%. The suggested UCD progenitor masses
agree with predictions from the tidal stripping scenario. Lower-mass UCDs
(M<10^7 M_*) exhibit a bimodal distribution in Psi, suggestive of a coexistence
of massive globular clusters and tidally stripped galaxies in this mass regime.
CONCLUSIONS: Central BHs as relict tracers of tidally stripped progenitor
galaxies are a plausible explanation for the elevated dynamical M/L ratios of
UCDs.

particle masses in the range 1.4-2.3keV and, for one case, we have carried out
further simulations at varying resolution. N-body simulations in which the

in filaments producing spurious clumps which, for small masses (<10^7Msun in

identify these spurious objects and remove them from our halo catalogues. We
find that the WDM subhalo mass function is suppressed by well over an order
magnitude relative to the CDM case for masses <10^9Msun. Requiring that there
should be at least as many subhaloes as there are observed satellites in the
Milky Way leads to a conservative lower limit to the (thermal equivalent) WDM

relative velocity effect may have a dramatic impact on the star formation at
high redshifts, if first stars are formed in minihalos around z~20, or if the
effect propagates through secondary effects to stars formed at later redshifts.
The relative velocity effect has particularly strong signatures in the large
scale clustering of these sources, including the BAO position. Assuming that a
small fraction of stars in low-redshift massive galaxies retain the memory of
the primordial relative velocity effect, galaxy clustering measurements can be
used to constrain the signatures of the first stars. Luminous red galaxies
contain some of the oldest stars in the Universe and are ideally suited to
search for this effect. Using the BOSS power spectrum measurements from the
Sloan Data Release 9, in combination with Planck, we derive the upper limit on
the fraction of the stars sensitive to relative velocity effect f_star<3.3% at
the 95% confidence level in the CMASS galaxy sample. If additional galaxy
sample not sensitive to the effect is available in a given survey, a joint
multi-tracer analysis can be applied to construct a sample-variance cancelling
combination, providing a model-independent way to verify the presence of the
relative velocity effect in the galaxy power spectrum on large scales. Such a
multi-tracer analysis in future galaxy surveys can greatly improve the current

associated with the neutrino-neutrino interactions. Recently, it has been
pointed out in \cite{Raffelt:2013rqa} that removing this assumption, a new
multi-azimuthal-angle (MAA) instability would emerge in the flavor evolution of
the dense SN neutrino gas in addition to the one caused by multi-zenith-angle
(MZA) effects. Inspired by this result, for the first time we numerically solve
the non-linear neutrino propagation equations in SN, introducing the azimuthal
angle as angular variable in addition to the usual zenith angle. We consider
simple energy spectra with an excess of \nu_e over anti-\nu_e. In these cases,
we find that even starting with a complete axial symmetric neutrino emission,
the MAA effects would lead to significant flavor conversions in normal mass
hierarchy, in cases otherwise stable under the only MZA effects. The final
outcome of the flavor conversions, triggered by the MAA instability, depends on
the initial asymmetry between \nu_e and anti-\nu_e spectra. If it is
sufficiently large, final spectra would show an ordered behavior with spectral
swaps and splits. Conversely, for small flavor asymmetries flavor decoherence
among angular modes develops, affecting the flavor evolution also in inverted
mass hierarchy.

Comparing BCGs in subsamples of compact and loose groups selected for their

integration over a single patch of sky of a few square degrees. In practice,
however, foregrounds abound and the sensitivity to B modes can be improved
considerably by finding the region of sky cleanest of foregrounds. The best
strategy to detect B modes thus involves a tradeoff between exploration (to
find lower-foreground patches) and exploitation (through prolonged

probability theory, wherein a gambler faces a series of slot machines with
unknown winning odds and must develop a strategy to maximize his/her winnings
with some finite number of pulls. While the optimal MAB strategy remains to be
determined, a number of algorithms have been developed in an effort to maximize

anisotropy on the observed Lya emission by performing radiative transfer
calculations for models of neutral hydrogen clouds with prescriptions of
spatial and kinematic anisotropies. The environmental anisotropy leads to
corresponding anisotropy in the Lya flux and spectral properties and induces
correlations among them. The Lya flux (or observed luminosity) depends on the
viewing angle and shows an approximate correlation with the initial Lya optical
depth in the viewing direction relative to those in all other directions. The
distribution of Lya flux from a set of randomly oriented clouds is skewed to
high values, providing a natural contribution to the Lya equivalent width (EW)
distribution seen in observation. A narrower EW distribution is found at a
larger peak offset of the Lya line, similar to the trend suggested in
observation. The peak offset appears to correlate with the line shape (full
width at half maximum and asymmetry), pointing to a possibility of using Lya
line features alone to determine the systemic redshifts of galaxies. The study
suggests that anisotropies in the spatial and kinematic distributions of
neutral hydrogen can be an important ingredient in shaping the observed
properties of Lya emission from star-forming galaxies. We discuss the
implications of using Lya emission to probe the circumgalactic and
intergalactic environments of galaxies.

SFHs derived here with our earlier results for the SMC bar to create a deep
pencil-beam survey of the global history of the central SMC. We find in all the
six fields observed with HST a slow star formation pace from 13 to 5-7 Gyr ago,
followed by a ~ 2-3 times higher activity. This is remarkable because dynamical
models do not predict a strong influence of either the LMC or the Milky Way
(MW) at that time. The level of the intermediate-age SFR enhancement
systematically increases towards the center, resulting in a gradient in the
mean age of the population, with the bar fields being systematically younger
than the outer ones. Star formation over the most recent 500 Myr is strongly
concentrated in the bar, the only exception being the area of the SMC wing. The
strong current activity of the latter is likely driven by interaction with the
LMC. At a given age, there is no significant difference in metallicity between
the inner and outer fields, implying that metals are well mixed throughout the
SMC. The age-metallicity relations we infer from our best fitting models are
monotonically increasing with time, with no evidence of dips. This may argue

Baseline Array data at 2, 5, 8.4, 15, 23.8, 43, and 86 GHz, especially focusing
on the multi-frequency properties of the radio core at the jet base. First, we
measured a size of the core region transverse to the jet axis, defined as
$W_{\rm c}$, at each frequency \nu, and found a relation between $W_{\rm c}$
and $\nu$ as $W_{\rm c}(\nu) \propto \nu^{-0.71\pm0.05}$. Then, by combining
$W_{\rm c}(\nu)$ and the frequency dependence of the core position $r_{\rm
c}(\nu)$, which was obtained by our previous study, we have constructed a
collimation profile of the innermost jet $W_{\rm c}(r)$ down to ~10
Schwarzschild radii ($R_{\rm s}$) from the central black hole. We found that
$W_{\rm c}(r)$ smoothly connects with the width profile of the outer
edge-brightened, parabolic jet, and then follows a similar radial dependence
down to several tens of $R_{\rm s}$. Closer to the black hole, the measured
radial profile suggests a possible change of the jet collimation shape from the
outer parabolic one, in which the jet shape tends to become more
radially-oriented. This could be related to a magnetic collimation process
or/and interaction with surrounding materials at the jet base. The present
results shed light on the importance of higher-sensitivity/resolution imaging
studies for M87 at 86, 43 and also 22 GHz, and should be examined more

Venus zonal flow or superrotation is explored, with the aid of a
Reynolds-averaged turbulence modeling approach. The basic framework is similar
to that of Gierasch (1975) in the sense that the mechanism is examined under a
given meridional circulation. The profile mimicking the observations of the
flow is initially assumed, and its maintenance mechanism in the presence of
turbulence effects is investigated from a viewpoint of the suppression of
energy cascade. In the present work, the turbulent viscosity is regarded as an
indicator of the intensity of the cascade. A novelty of this formalism is the
use of the isotropic turbulent viscosity based on a nonlocal time scale linked
to a large-scale flow structure. The mechanism is first discussed
qualitatively. On the basis of these discussions, the two-dimensional numerical
simulation of the proposed model is performed, with an initially assumed
superrotation, and the fast zonal flow is shown to be maintained, compared with
the turbulent viscosity lacking the nonlocal time scale. The relationship of
the present model with the current general-circulation-model simulation is
discussed in light of a crucial role of the vertical viscosity.

our approaches under a simple caching framework by picking the k most popular

the cache. We develop our approach by first incorporating video inter-arrival
time (based on the power-law distribution governing the transmission time
between two receivers of the same message in scale-free networks) to the
baseline (LRFU), then combining with an information diffusion model over the
inferred latent social graph that governs diffusion of videos in the network.
We apply techniques from latent social network inference to learn the sharing
probabilities between users in the network and apply a virus propagation model
borrowed from mathematical epidemiology to estimate the number of times a video

is mapped to the problem domain. Normally, this grid is a k-dimensional
bounding box that covers a k-dimensional problem no matter its shape. Threads
that fall inside the problem domain perform computations, otherwise they are
discarded at runtime. For problems with non-square geometry, this is not always
the best idea because part of the space of computation is executed without any
practical use. Two- dimensional triangular domain problems, alias td-problems,
are a particular case of interest. Problems such as the Euclidean distance map,
LU decomposition, collision detection and simula- tions over triangular tiled
domains are all td-problems and they appear frequently in many areas of
science. In this work, we propose an improved GPU mapping function g(lambda),
that maps any lambda block to a unique location (i, j) in the triangular
domain. The mapping is based on the properties of the lower triangular matrix
and it works at a block level, thus not compromising thread organization within
a block. The theoretical improvement from using g(lambda) is upper bounded as I
< 2 and the number of wasted blocks is reduced from O(n^2) to O(n). We compare
our strategy with other proposed methods; the upper-triangular mapping (UTM),
the rectangular box (RB) and the recursive partition (REC). Our experimental
results on Nvidias Kepler GPU architecture show that g(lambda) is between 12%
and 15% faster than the bounding box (BB) strategy. When compared to the other
strategies, our mapping runs significantly faster than UTM and it is as fast as
RB in practical use, with the advantage that thread organization is not
compromised, as in RB. This work also contributes at presenting, for the first

intimately related to velocity-weakening friction, in which the frictional

frictional response has been studied extensively, less attention has been given
to steady-state velocity-strengthening friction, in spite of its potential
importance for various aspects of frictional phenomena such as the propagation
speed of interfacial rupture fronts and the amount of stored energy released by
them. In this note we suggest that a crossover from steady-state
velocity-weakening friction at small slip velocities to steady-state
velocity-strengthening friction at higher velocities might be a generic feature
of dry friction. We further argue that while thermally activated rheology
naturally gives rise to logarithmic steady-state velocity-strengthening
friction, a crossover to stronger-than-logarithmic strengthening might take
place at higher slip velocities, possibly accompanied by a change in the
dominant dissipation mechanism. We sketch a few physical mechanisms that may
account for the crossover to stronger-than-logarithmic steady-state
velocity-strengthening and compile a rather extensive set of experimental data
available in the literature, lending support to these ideas.

by making use of the subtraction method proposed previously to solve double

scales are continuously examined. We analysed the VLBA archival data taken at
43 and 86 GHz to measure the size of VLBI cores. Millimeter/sub-mm VLBI cores
are considered as innermost jet emissions, which has been originally suggested
by Blandford & K\""onigl. Those components fairly follow an extrapolated
parabolic streamline in our previous study so that the jet has a single
power-law structure with nearly five orders of magnitude in the distance
starting from the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH), less than 10
Schwarzschild radius ($r_{\rm s}$). We further inspect the jet parabolic
structure as a counterpart of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) nozzle in order to
identify the property of a bulk acceleration. We interpret that the parabolic
jet consists of Poynting-flux dominated flows, powered by large amplitude,
nonlinear torsional Alfv\'en waves. We examine the non-relativistic MHD nozzle
equation in a parabolic shape. The nature of trans-fast magnetosonic flow is
similar to the one of transonic solution of Parker's hydrodynamic solar wind;
the jet becomes super-escape as well as super-fast magnetosonic at around $\sim
10^{3}\,r_{\rm s}$, while the upstream trans-Alfv\'enic flow speed increases
linearly as a function of the distance at $\sim 10^{2}$ - $10^{3}\, r_{\rm s}$.
We here point out that this is the first evidence to identify these features in
astrophysical jets. We propose that the M87 jet is magnetically accelerated,
but thermally confined by the stratified ISM inside the sphere of gravitational
influence of the SMBH potential, which may be a norm in AGN jets.

nuclei (AGN), although direct observational evidence for this conjecture is
sparse. The accretion disk luminosity and jet power, on the other hand, have
long been observed to follow a linear correlation. If jet power is coupled to
black hole spin, deviations from the jet-disk correlation for a sample of AGN
can be used to probe the dispersion of the spin parameter within this sample.
To exploit this idea, we matched double-lobed radio sources from the FIRST
survey to spectroscopically confirmed quasars from SDSS. We obtain 763 FR-II
quasars with a median redshift of z=1.2 A tight correlation between the optical
luminosity of the accretion disk and the lobe radio luminosity is observed. We
estimate that 5-20% of the bolometric disk luminosity is converted to jet
power. Most of the scatter to the optical-radio correlation is due to
environment; deviations from jet-disk coupling due to internal factors (e.g.,
spin) contribute at most 0.2 dex. Under the assumption that the
Blandford-Znajek mechanism operates in AGN, we obtain an upper limit of 0.1 dex
to the dispersion of the product of the spin and the magnetic flux threading
the horizon. If black hole spin determines the AGN jet efficiency, then our
observations imply that all FR-II quasars have very similar spin. In addition,
the quasar spin distribution needs to have a wide gap to explain the
radio-quiet population. The alternative, and perhaps more likely,
interpretation of the tight jet-disk correlation is that black hole spin is not
relevant for powering AGN jets.

analyze, publish and share data. Since RDBMS are originally designed for, and
their development directions are primarily driven by, business use cases they
often lack features very important for scientific applications. Horizontal
scalability is probably the most important missing feature which makes it
challenging to adapt traditional relational database systems to the ever
growing data sizes. Due to the limited support of array data types and metadata
management, successful application of RDBMS in science usually requires the
development of custom extensions. While some of these extensions are specific
to the field of science, the majority of them could easily be generalized and
reused in other disciplines. With the Graywulf project we intend to target
several goals. We are building a generic platform that offers reusable
components for efficient storage, transformation, statistical analysis and
presentation of scientific data stored in Microsoft SQL Server. Graywulf also
addresses the distributed computational issues arising from current RDBMS
technologies. The current version supports load balancing of simple queries and
parallel execution of partitioned queries over a set of mirrored databases.
Uniform user access to the data is provided through a web based query interface
and a data surface for software clients. Queries are formulated in a slightly
modified syntax of SQL that offers a transparent view of the distributed data.

in a two-up one-down spin configuration but the spin correlation does not
develop any superstructure. We call this state the loop liquid, as it is

We elucidate that the system shows phase transitions from the loop liquid to

crystallization and cohesion of the loops, respectively. We demonstrate that
the loop formation is observed in the optical conductivity as a characteristic

receptors, downstream signaling molecules, time and fuel. However, it is not
known which resources fundamentally limit the precision of sensing, like weak
links in a chain, and which can compensate each other, leading to trade-offs
between them. We show by modeling that in equilibrium systems the precision is
limited by the number of receptors; the downstream network can never increase
precision. This limit arises from a trade-off between the removal of extrinsic
noise in the receptor and intrinsic noise in the downstream network.
Non-equilibrium systems can lift this trade-off by storing the receptor state
over time in chemical modification states of downstream molecules. As we
quantify for a push-pull network, this requires i) time and receptors; ii)
downstream molecules; iii) energy (fuel turnover) to drive modification. These
three resource classes cannot compensate each other, and it is the limiting
class which sets the fundamental sensing limit. Within each class, trade-offs
are possible. Energy allows a power-speed trade-off, while time can be traded
against receptors.

remains regular. Additionally, it is claimed that the velocity behaves as the

cis-regulation of gene expression -- such as transcriptional enhancers and
promoters -- is critical for understanding the evolution of genomes, yet it
remains a major challenge. Many studies have attempted to detect positive or
negative selection in these noncoding elements by searching for those with the
fastest or slowest rates of evolution, but this can be problematic. Here we
introduce a new approach to this issue, and demonstrate its utility on three
mammalian transcriptional enhancers. Using results from saturation mutagenesis
studies of these enhancers, we classified all possible point mutations as
up-regulating, down-regulating, or silent, and determined which of these
mutations have occurred on each branch of a phylogeny. Applying a framework
analogous to Ka/Ks in protein-coding genes, we measured the strength of
selection on up-regulating and down-regulating mutations, in specific branches
as well as entire phylogenies. We discovered distinct modes of selection acting
on different enhancers: while all three have experienced negative selection
against down-regulating mutations, the selection pressures on up-regulating
mutations vary. In one case we detected positive selection for up-regulation,
while the other two had no detectable selection on up-regulating mutations. Our
methodology is applicable to the growing number of saturation mutagenesis data
sets, and provides a detailed picture of the mode and strength of natural
selection acting on cis-regulatory elements.

the cis-regulation of gene expression, our knowledge of the molecular
mechanisms underlying these adaptations has lagged far behind. Across all model
organisms the causal mutations have been discovered for only a handful of gene
expression adaptations, and even for these, mechanistic details (e.g. the
trans-regulatory factors involved) have not been determined. We previously
reported a polygenic gene expression adaptation involving down-regulation of
the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway in the budding yeast Saccharomyces
cerevisiae. Here we investigate the molecular mechanism of a cis-acting
mutation affecting a member of this pathway, ERG28. We show that the causal
mutation is a two-base deletion in the promoter of ERG28 that strongly reduces
the binding of two transcription factors, Sok2 and Mot3, thus abolishing their
regulation of ERG28. This down-regulation increases resistance to a widely used
antifungal drug targeting ergosterol, similar to mutations disrupting this
pathway in clinical yeast isolates. The identification of the causal genetic
variant revealed that the selection likely occurred after the deletion was
already present at high frequency in the population, rather than when it was a
new mutation. These results provide a detailed view of the molecular mechanism
of a cis-regulatory adaptation, and underscore the importance of this view to
our understanding of evolution at the molecular level.

particles. This is independent of the mechanism responsible for SUSY breaking.
Any model will have one Lightest SUSY Particle (LSP), and one Next to Lightest
SUSY Particle (NLSP). In models with conserved R-parity, the NLSP must decay
solely to the LSP and the SM partner of the NLSP. Therefore, studying NLSP
production and decay can be regarded as a ""simplified model without
simplification"": Any SUSY model will have such a process.
  The NLSP could be any sparticle: a slepton, an electroweak-ino, or even a
squark. However, since there are only a finite number of sparticles, one can
systematically search for signals of all possible NLSP:s. This way, the entire
space of models that have a kinematicall y reachable NLSP can be covered. For
any NLSP, the ""worst case"" can be determined, since the SUSY principle allows
to calculate the cross-section once the NLSP nature and mass are given. The
region in the LSP-NLSP mass-plane where the ""worst case"" could be discovered or
excluded experimentally can be found by estimating background and efficiency at
each point in the plane. From experience at LEP, it is expected that the lower
signal-to background ratio will indeed be found for models with conserved
R-parity.

was at LEP. No loop-holes are left, even for difficult or non-standard cases:
whatever the NLSP is it will be detectable.

of flares with relatively high X-ray intensity for the deep solar minimum (e.g.
$\gtrsim$1 \times 10^{-6}$ W m$^{-2}$ or C1) are not associated with CMEs.
Intense flares tend to occur in active regions with strong and complex
photospheric magnetic field, but the active regions that produce CME-associated
flares tend to be small, including those that have no sunspots and therefore no
NOAA active-region numbers. Other factors on scales comparable to and larger
than active regions seem to exist that contribute to the association of flares
with CMEs. We find the possible low coronal signatures of CMEs, namely
eruptions, dimmings, EUV waves, and Type III bursts, in 91%, 74%, 57%, and 74%,

absorption of red giants (which are used to trace the LMC extinction), the
extinction in the other three IRAC bands show a flat curve, close to the Milky
Way Rv = 5.5 model extinction curve (where Rv is the optical total-to-selective

uncertainties of Ks-\lambda and J-Ks is explored in terms of Monte-Carlo
simulations. It is found that this could lead to an overestimation of

morphological inhomogeneity on carrier diffusion in organic thin films. The
morphological inhomogeneity was considered in the simulation by incorporating
the regions of low energetic disorder in a host lattice of high energetic
disorder which decreases the overall energetic disorder of the system. For the
homogeneous films, the carrier diffusion was found to decrease upon decreasing
the energetic disorder. In contrast to this, in the case of inhomogeneous films
the carrier diffusion enhanced upon decreasing the overall energetic disorder,
up to an optimum value and beyond which the carrier diffusion decreased.
Through our simulation, we observed that the behavior of carrier diffusion in
the inhomogeneous case is due to the morphology dependent carrier spreading,
which acts in addition to the thermal and non-thermal field assisted diffusion
mechanisms. This morphological dependence of carrier spreading arises due to
the generation of packets of carriers with different jump rates, which is after
effect of slow relaxation of the carriers generated in the less disordered
regions of inhomogeneous system. Our simulation of morphology dependent carrier
spreading and its influence on the basic diffusion process provide deeper
insight into the charge transport mechanisms in organic thin films.

extremal rings and holes of the same spins. We show that for such regions the
hole has generically a larger entropy than the ring, and likewise, the central
charge of the proposed chiral 2d CFT dual to the hole is larger than that of
the ring. For special places of this overlapping region where one of the spins
tends to zero, the entropies of the extremal ring and hole also tend to zero
and essentially become equal. In this case we are dealing with Extremal
Vanishing Horizon (EVH) black holes or rings. The near horizon geometry of the

for the EVH/CFT proposal, a 2d CFT description of the low energy excitations of

distinguished from this dual 2d CFT viewpoint: The hole is a thermal state with

properties of occurrence frequency of superflares, and basically confirmed the
previous results, i.e., the occurrence frequency (dN/dE) of superflares vs
flare energy (E) shows power-law distribution with dN/dE \propto E^{-\alpha},
where \alpha ~ 2. It is interesting that this distribution is roughly on the
same line as that for solar flares. In the case of the Sun-like stars (with
surface temperature 5600-6000K and slowly rotating with a period longer than 10

  We also studied long term (500 days) stellar brightness variation of these

of superflares was extremely high, ~ 57 superflares in 500 days (i.e., once in

frequency of one superflares (with 10^34 erg) in 100 days. There is evidence
that these superflares have extremely large starspots with a size about 10
times larger than that of the largest sunspot. We argue that the physical
origin of extremely high occurrence frequency of superflares in these stars may
be attributed to the existence of extremely large starspots.

Toulouse et al. [Theor. Chem. Acc. 114, 305 (2005)] is explored in the context
of multi-configuration range-separated density-functional theory. The new
decomposition of the short-range exchange-correlation energy relies on the
auxiliary long-range interacting wavefunction rather than the Kohn-Sham (KS)
determinant. The advantage, relative to the traditional KS decomposition, is
that the wavefunction part of the energy is now computed with the regular
(fully-interacting) Hamiltonian. One potential drawback is that, because of
double counting, the wavefunction used to compute the energy cannot be obtained
by minimizing the energy expression with respect to the wavefunction
parameters. The problem is overcome by using short-range optimized effective
potentials (OEPs). The resulting combination of OEP techniques with
wavefunction theory has been investigated in this work, at the Hartree-Fock
(HF) and multi-configuration self-consistent-field (MCSCF) levels. In the HF
case, an analytical expression for the energy gradient has been derived and
implemented. Calculations have been performed within the short-range local
density approximation on H2, N2, Li2 and H2O. Significant improvements in
binding energies are obtained with the new decomposition of the short-range
energy. The importance of optimizing the short-range OEP at the MCSCF level
when static correlation becomes significant has also been demonstrated for H2,
using a finite-difference gradient. The implementation of the analytical
gradient for MCSCF wavefunctions is currently in progress.

originally in our recent publications. Some new analyses, insights and
perspectives are also provided. We showed recently that the symmetry energy
$E_{sym}(\rho)$ and its density slope $L(\rho)$ at an arbitrary density $\rho$
can be expressed analytically in terms of the magnitude and momentum dependence
of the single-nucleon potentials using the Hugenholtz-Van Hove (HVH) theorem.
These relationships provide new insights about the fundamental physics
governing the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy. Using the isospin
and momentum (k) dependent MDI interaction as an example, the contribution of
different terms in the single-nucleon potential to the $E_{sym}(\rho)$ and
$L(\rho)$ are analyzed in detail at different densities. It is shown that the
behavior of $E_{sym}(\rho)$ is mainly determined by the first-order symmetry
potential $U_{sym,1}(\rho,k)$ of the single-nucleon potential. The density
slope $L(\rho)$ depends not only on the first-order symmetry potential
$U_{sym,1}(\rho,k)$ but also the second-order one $U_{sym,2}(\rho,k)$. Both the
$U_{sym,1}(\rho,k)$ and $U_{sym,2}(\rho,k)$ at normal density $\rho_0$ are
constrained by the isospin and momentum dependent nucleon optical potential
extracted from the available nucleon-nucleus scattering data. The
$U_{sym,2}(\rho,k)$ especially at high density and momentum affects
significantly the $L(\rho)$, but it is theoretically poorly understood and
currently there is almost no experimental constraints known.

rekindled the research interest in random access protocols, suitable to support
a large number of connected devices. Slotted ALOHA and its derivatives
represent a simple solution for distributed random access in wireless networks.
Recently, a framed version of slotted ALOHA gained renewed interest due to the
incorporation of successive interference cancellation (SIC) in the scheme,
which resulted in substantially higher throughputs. Based on similar principles
and inspired by the rateless coding paradigm, a frameless approach for
distributed random access in slotted ALOHA framework is described in this
paper. The proposed approach shares an operational analogy with rateless
coding, expressed both through the user access strategy and the adaptive length
of the contention period, with the objective to end the contention when the
instantaneous throughput is maximized. The paper presents the related analysis,
providing heuristic criteria for terminating the contention period and showing
that very high throughputs can be achieved, even for a low number for
contending users. The demonstrated results potentially have more direct
practical implications compared to the approaches for coded random access that
lead to high throughputs only asymptotically.

systems with state X(t) evolving on the unitary group U(n) and m inputs. The
T-sampling stabilization problem is introduced and solved: given any initial
condition X(0) any goal state Xg find a feedback law such that X(jT) converges
to Xg as the integer j tends to infinity. The purpose is to generate arbitrary
quantum gates corresponding to Xg. This is achieved by the tracking of
T-periodic reference trajectories that pass by Xg using the framework of
Coron's Return Method. The T-periodic reference trajectories are generated by
applying open-loop controls that are a sum of a finite number M of odd
T-periodic function whose amplitudes are parameterized by a vector. The main
result establishes that, for M big enough, X(jT) exponentially converges
towards Xg for almost all fixed amplitude vectors, with explicit and completely
constructive control laws. This paper also establishes a stochastic version of
this deterministic control law. The key idea is to randomly choose a different
amplitude vector at each sampling time jT, and keeping it fixed until the next
sampling time (j+1)T. It is also shown that X(jT) exponentially converges
towards Xg almost surely. Simulation results have indicated that the

An inference is based on the principle of resolution. Sentences of natural

describe physical objects and processes, abstract objects, categories and
semantic relations between objects. Predicates for concrete assertions are
saved in a database. To describe the semantics of classes for physical objects,
abstract concepts and processes, a knowledge base is applied. The proposed
representation of natural language sentences is a semantic net. Nodes of such

typification of nodes facilitates essentially forming of processing algorithms

(particularly for the great number of nodes), thirdly, to describe the
semantics of words, encyclopedic knowledge is used, and this permits
essentially to extend the class of solved problems.

derived from Q3 data. In most cases a second period close to the rotation
period was detected, which we interpreted as surface differential rotation
(DR). Active stars were selected from the whole sample using the range of the
variability amplitude. To detect different periods in the light curves we used
the Lomb-Scargle periodogram in a pre-whitening approach to achieve parameters
for a global sine fit. The most dominant periods from the fit were ascribed to
different surface rotation periods, but spot evolution could also play a role.
Due to the large number of stars the period errors were estimated in a
statistical way. We thus cannot exclude the existence of false positives among
our periods. In our sample of 40.661 active stars we found 24.124 rotation
periods $P_1$ between 0.5-45 days. The distribution of stars with 0.5 < B-V <
1.0 and ages derived from angular momentum evolution that are younger than 300
Myr is consistent with a constant star-formation rate. A second period $P_2$
within $\pm30$% of the rotation period $P_1$ was found in 18.619 stars (77.2%).
Attributing these two periods to DR we found that the relative shear
$\alpha=\Delta\Omega/\Omega$ increases with rotation period, and slightly
decreases with effective temperature. The absolute shear $\Delta\Omega$
slightly increases between $T_{eff}=3500-6000$ K. Above 6000 K $\Delta\Omega$
shows much larger scatter. We found weak dependence of $\Delta\Omega$ on
rotation period. Latitudinal differential rotation measured for the first time
in more than 18.000 stars provides a comprehensive picture of stellar surface
shear, consistent with major predictions from mean-field theory. To what extent
our observations are prone to false positives and selection bias is not fully
explored, and needs to be addressed using more Kepler data.

smoothing splines using general linear systems. This problem, also called
monotone control theoretic splines, has been solved only when the curve
generator is modeled by the second-order integrator, but not for other cases.
The difficulty in the problem is that the monotonicity constraint should be
satisfied over an interval which has the cardinality of the continuum. To solve
this problem, we first formulate the problem as a semi-infinite quadratic
programming, and then we adopt a discretization technique to obtain a
finite-dimensional quadratic programming problem. It is shown that the solution
of the finite-dimensional problem always satisfies the infinite-dimensional
monotonicity constraint. It is also proved that the approximated solution
converges to the exact solution as the discretization grid-size tends to zero.
An example is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

relations, which quantify an inevitable tradeoff in knowledge. Here we study
complementarity in the context of an information processing task: we link the
complementarity of two observables to their usefulness for superdense coding
(SDC). In SDC, Alice sends two classical dits of information to Bob by sending
a single qudit. However, we show that encoding with commuting unitaries
prevents Alice from sending more than one dit per qudit, implying that
complementarity is necessary for SDC to be advantagous over a classical
strategy for information transmission. When Alice encodes with products of
Pauli operators for the $X$ and $Z$ bases, we quantify the complementarity of
these encodings in terms of the overlap of the $X$ and $Z$ basis elements. Our
main result explicitly solves for the SDC capacity as a function of the
complementarity, showing that the entropy of the overlap matrix gives the
capacity, when the preshared state is maximally entangled. We generalise this
equation to resources with symmetric noise such as a preshared Werner state. In
the most general case of arbitrary noisy resources, we obtain an analogous
lower bound on the SDC capacity. Our results shed light on the role of
complementarity in determining the quantum advantage in SDC and also seem
fundamentally interesting since they bear a striking resemblance to uncertainty
relations.

cues. Such self-organized polarity is induced by spontaneous symmetry breaking
in the intracellular activities, which produces an emergent memory effect
associated with slow-changing mode. Therefore, spontaneously established
polarity should play a pivotal role in efficient chemotaxis. In this study, we
develop a model of chemotactic cell migration that demonstrates the connection
between intracellular polarity and chemotactic accuracy. Spontaneous polarity
formation and gradient sensing are described by a stochastic differential
equation. We demonstrate that the direction of polarity persists over a
characteristic time that is predicted to depend on the chemoattractant
concentration. Next, we theoretically derive the chemotactic accuracy as a
function of both the gradient sensing ability and the characteristic time of
polarity direction. The results indicate that the accuracy can be improved by
the polarity. Furthermore, the analysis of chemotactic accuracy suggests that
accuracy is maximized at some optimal responsiveness to extracellular
perturbations. To obtain the model parameters, we studied the correlation time
of random cell migration in cell tracking analysis of Dictyostelium cells. As
predicted, the persistence time depended on the chemoattractant concentration.
From the fitted parameters, we inferred that polarized Dictyosteium cells can
respond optimally to a chemical gradient. Chemotactic accuracy was almost 10
times larger than can be achieved by non-polarized gradient sensing. Using the
obtained parameter values, we show that polarity also improves the dynamic
range of chemotaxis.

tensile in-plane strain and increases with compressive in-plane strain. We also
predict, using the semiclassical Boltzmann approach, that the magnitude of the
n-type Seebeck coefficient of Bi2Te3 can be increased by the compressive
in-plane strain, while that of Bi2Se3 can be increased with tensile in-plane
strain. Further, the in-plane power factor of n-doped Bi2Se3 can be increased
with compressive uniaxial strain, while that of n-doped Bi2Te3 can be increased
by compressive in-plane strain. ...

correlations, i.e., a node tends to link to other nodes with similar (or

attempts to characterize topological structures of urban street networks. We
adopted six urban street networks (three European and three North American),
and converted them into network topologies in which nodes and edges
respectively represent individual streets and street intersections, and
compared the network topologies to three reference network topologies
(biological, technological, and social). The urban street network topologies
(with the exception of Manhattan) showed a consistent pattern that distinctly
differs from the three reference networks. The topologies of urban street
networks lack striking degree correlations in general. Through reshuffling the
network topologies towards for example maximum or minimum degree correlations
while retaining the initial degree distributions, we found that all the
surrogate topologies of the urban street networks, as well as the reference
ones, tended to deviate from small world properties. This implies that the
initial degree correlations do not have any positive or negative effect on the
networks' performance or functions.

dense QCD matter, with a particular emphasis on the CFL phase exhibiting
superfluidity and superconductivity, and their phenomenological implications in
terms of the effective field theories such as the Ginzburg-Landau theory, the
chiral Lagrangian, or the Bogoliubov--de Gennes equation. The most fundamental
topological excitations are non-Abelian vortices, which are 1/3 quantized
superfluid vortices and color magnetic flux tubes. They are created at a phase
transition or a rotation such compact stars. The intervortex-interaction is
repulsive and consequently a vortex lattice is formed. Bosonic and fermionic
zero-energy modes are trapped in the vortex core and propagate along it as
gapless excitations. The former consists of translational zero modes (a Kelvin
mode) with a quadratic dispersion and CP(2) Nambu-Goldstone gapless modes with
a linear dispersion, while the latter is the triplet Majorana fermion zero
modes. The low-energy effective theory of the bosonic zero modes is a
non-relativistic free complex scalar field and a CP(2) model in 1+1 dimensions.
The effects of strange quark mass, electromagnetic interactions and
non-perturbative quantum corrections are taken into account. Colorful boojums
at the CFL interface, quantum color magnetic monopole confined by vortices,
which supports the notion of quark-hadron duality, and Yang-Mills instantons
inside a vortex as lumps are discussed. The interactions between a vortex and
quasi-particles such as phonons, gluons, mesons, and photons are studied. A
vortex lattice is shown to behave as a cosmic polarizer. Non-Abelian vortices
are shown to behave as a novel kind of non-Abelian anyons. For the chiral
symmetry breaking, we discuss fractional and integer axial domain walls,
Abelian and non-Abelian axial vortices, axial wall-vortex composites, and
Skyrmions.

discontinuous MIT with a finite minimum metallic conductivity. The striking
contrast to reports on other disordered substances motivates the present
in-depth study of the influence of the MIT criterion used on the
characterization of the MIT. First, we discuss in detail the inherent biases of
the various available approaches to locating the MIT. Second, reanalyzing the
GeSb_2Te_4 measurements, we show that this material resembles other disordered
solids to a large extent: according to a widely-used approach, these data may
also be interpreted in terms of a continuous MIT. Checking the justification of
the respective fits, however, uncovers inconsistencies in the experimental
data. Third, comparing with previous experimental studies of crystalline Si:As,
Si:P, Si:B, Ge:Ga, CdSe:In, n-Cd_{0.95}Mn$_{0.05}Se,

we show that such an inconclusive behavior occurs frequently: the analysis of
the logarithmic temperature derivative of the conductivity highlights serious
inconsistencies in the original interpretations in terms of a continuous MIT.
In part, they are common to all these studies and seem to be generic, in part,
they vary from experiment to experiment and may arise from measurement
problems. Thus, the question for the character of the MIT of these materials
has to be considered as yet open. The challenges now lie in improving the
measurement precision and in developing a microscopic theory capable of
explaining the seemingly generic features.

of general interest where the effect of shape is often neglected. We report a
comprehensive study on size dependent structural parameters of ZnO
nanostructures (NS) having a wide range of aspect ratios (length/diameter). It
reveals that with increase in size, ZnO NS undergo a shape transition from
spherical to rod like morphology that induces sudden change in internal
parameter (u) which represents relative position of two hexagonal close-packed
sublattices. The change in u introduces concomitant changes in anion-cation
(Zn-O) bond lengths as well as bond angles and thereby bears a linear
dependence with the aspect ratio (AR). Further, the unit cell volume and
microstrain decrease with increase in particle size and show a drastic
reduction when flat crystal faces begin to appear at the spherical surface
(AR~1.3). The significant change in structural parameters associated with the
shape transition arises due to surface dipole induced electrostatic relaxation
that may be further influenced by interaction with the ambient gases as
evidenced from the Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS)
measurement. The present study addresses the underlying reasons of shape
induced change in structural and electronic properties of ZnO NS.

systems are thought to be the progenitors of gamma ray bursts (GRBs), and may
also be associated with kilonovae. In this paper we present the merger event
rates of these objects as a function of cosmological redshift. We provide the
results for four cases, each one investigating a different important evolution
parameter of binary stars. Each case is also presented for two metallicity
evolution scenarios. We find that (i) in most cases NS-NS systems dominate the
merger rates in the local Universe, while BH-BH mergers dominate at high
redshift; (ii) BH-NS mergers are less frequent than other sources per unit
volume, for all time; and (iii) natal kicks may alter the observable properties
of populations in a significant way, allowing the underlying models of binary
evolution and compact object formation to be easily distinguished. This is the
second paper in a series of three. The third paper will focus on calculating
the detection rates of mergers by gravitational wave telescopes.

of the two-infall model: in particular, the gradients of oxygen and iron and
their temporal evolution. First, we explore the effects of several physical
processes which influence the formation and evolution of abundance gradients.
They are: i) the inside-out formation of the disk, ii) a threshold in the gas
density for star formation, iii) a variable star formation efficiency along the
disk, iv) radial flows and their speed, and v) different total surface mass
density (gas plus stars) distributions for the halo. We are able to reproduce
at best the present day gradients of oxygen and iron if we assume an inside-out
formation, no threshold gas density, a constant efficiency of star formation
along the disk and radial gas flows. It is particularly important the choice of
the velocity pattern for radial flows and the combination of this velocity
pattern with the surface mass density distribution in the halo. Having selected
the best model, we then explore the evolution of abundance gradients in time
and find that the gradients in general steepen in time and that at redshift z~3
there is a gradient inversion in the inner regions of the disk, in the sense
that at early epochs the oxygen abundance decreases toward the Galactic center.
This effect, which has been observed, is naturally produced by our models if an
inside-out formation of the disk and and a constant star formation efficiency
are assumed. The inversion is due to the fact that in the inside-out formation
a strong infall of primordial gas, contrasting chemical enrichment, is present
in the innermost disk regions at early times. The gradient inversion remains
also in the presence of radial flows, either with constant or variable speed in
time, and this is a new result.

a multi-component warm absorber (WA) in the X-rays with four distinct
ionisation degrees (log xi = 1.0, log xi = 1.7, log xi = 2.4, and log xi = 3.0)
outflowing at several hundreds of km/s. In the UV we detect 15 kinematic
components in the absorbers, blueshifted with respect to the systemic velocity
of the source, ranging from -60 km/s to -1520 km/s. Although the predicted CIV
and NV column densities from the low-ionisation X-ray outflow are in agreement
with those measured for some components in the STIS spectrum, there are
kinematic discrepancies that may prevent both the X-ray and UV absorbers from
originating in the same intervening gas. We derive upper limits on the location
of the absorbers finding that the high-ionisation gas lie within ~6 - 29 pc
from the central ionising source, while the low-ionisation gas is located at
several hundreds of pc. This is consistent with our line of sight passing
through different parts of a stratified wind. The total kinetic energy of the
outflows injected into the surroundings of the host galaxy only accounts for a
tiny fraction of the bolometric luminosity of the source, and it is therefore
unlikely that they may cause a significant impact in the interstellar medium of

Bernoulli with mean $f(p).$ A fast algorithm is a function that only depends on
the values of $X_1,\ldots,X_T$, where $T$ is a stopping time with small mean.
When $f(p)$ is a real analytic function the problem reduces to being able to
draw from linear functions $Cp$ for a constant $C > 1$. Also it is necessary
that $Cp \leq 1 - \epsilon$ for known $\epsilon > 0$. Previous methods for this
problem required extensive modification of the algorithm for every value of $C$

a function of $C$ and $\epsilon$. This paper presents the first Bernoulli
factory for $f(p) = Cp$ with bounds on $\text{E}[T]$ as a function of the input
parameters. In fact, $\sup_{p \in [0,(1-\epsilon)/C]} \text{E}[T] \leq
9.5C\epsilon^{-1}.$ In addition, this method is very simple to implement.
Furthermore, a lower bound on the average running time of any $Cp$ Bernoulli
factory is shown. For $\epsilon \leq 1/2$, $\sup_{p \in [0,(1 - \epsilon)/C]}
\text{E}[T] \geq 0.004 C \epsilon^{-1}$, so the new method is optimal up to a

answers the question whether $PSL_5(2)$ is the monodromy group of a rational

class triples in $PSL_5(2)$, as there are no rigid, rational genus-zero
triples. Also, for 4-tuples, our family is the only one with a Hurwitz curve of
genus zero (however it does not seem immediately clear without explicit
computations whether this curve can be defined as a rational curve over

Riemannian manifolds M. We study the relations between the geometry of M and
the number of solutions to a generalized Killing spinor equation obtained from
a 5-dimensional supergravity. The existence of 1 pair of solutions is related
to almost contact metric structures. We also discuss special cases related to
$M = S1 \times M4$, which leads to M being foliated by submanifolds with
special properties, such as Quaternion-Kahler. When there are 2 pairs of
solutions, the closure of the isometry sub-algebra generated by the solutions
requires M to be S3 or T3-fibration over a Riemann surface. 4 pairs of
solutions pin down the geometry of M to very few possibilities. Finally, we
propose a new supersymmetric theory for N = 1 vector multiplet on K-contact
manifold admitting solutions to the Killing spinor equation.

The various frequencies of maximum amplification are correctly estimated by the

well retrieved by the numerical simulations but, due to the sensitivity of the

has to be considered. The influence of the wave-field incidence and material

taken with Herschel/PACS as part of the DIGIT key project. The sample includes
22 Herbig AeBe and 8 T Tauri sources. Multiple atomic fine structure and
molecular lines are detected at the source position: [OI], [CII], CO, OH, H_2O,
CH^+. The most common feature is the [OI] 63micron line detected in almost all
of the sources followed by OH. In contrast with CO, OH is detected toward both
Herbig AeBe groups (flared and non-flared sources). An isothermal LTE slab
model fit to the OH lines indicates column densities of 10^13 < N_OH < 10^16
cm^-2, emitting radii 15 < r < 100 AU and excitation temperatures 100 < T_ex <
400 K. The OH emission thus comes from a warm layer in the disk at intermediate
stellar distances. Warm H_2O emission is detected through multiple lines toward
the T Tauri systems AS 205, DG Tau, S CrA and RNO 90 and three Herbig AeBe
systems HD 104237, HD 142527, HD 163296 (through line stacking). Overall,
Herbig AeBe sources have higher OH/H_2O abundance ratios across the disk than
do T Tauri disks, from near- to far-infrared wavelengths. Far-infrared CH^+
emission is detected toward HD 100546 and HD 97048. The slab model suggests
moderate excitation (T_ex ~ 100 K) and compact (r ~ 60 AU) emission in the case
of HD 100546. The [CII] emission is spatially extended in all sources where the
line is detected. This suggests that not all [CII] emission is associated with
the disk and that there is a substantial contribution from diffuse material
around the young stars. The flux ratios of the atomic fine structure lines are
consistent with a disk origin for the oxygen lines for most of the sources.

rate and the correlation with stellar activity. X-ray and ultraviolet
(XUV)-driven evaporation is possible if one accepts a relatively high XUV flux
and a high efficiency for converting the input energy to the kinetic energy of
the atmosphere. Star-planet magnetic interaction is another possible scenario

is to create bandgaps of order 1eV as simply as possible. The most successful
methods for the creation of gaps in graphene are (a) confining the electrons in
nanoribbons, which is technically difficult or (b) placing a potential
difference across bilayer graphene, which is limited to gaps of around 300meV

can be created without applying an external electric field, by using the
electron-phonon interaction formed when bilayer graphene is sandwiched between
highly polarisable ionic materials. We derive and solve self-consistent
equations, finding that a large gap can be formed for intermediate
electron-phonon coupling. The gap originates from the amplification of an
intrinsic Coulomb interaction due to the proximity of carbon atoms in
neighbouring planes.

It is demonstrated that, at liquid-helium temperatures, these films exhibit all
the characteristic features of intrinsic electron-glasses. These include a slow
(logarithmic in time) conductance-relaxation that may be induced by any of the
following protocols: Quench-cooling from high temperatures, sudden change of
gate-voltage, exposure to infrared radiation, and stressing the system with a
non-Ohmic field. The microstructure of the films are characterized by electron
microscopy and their carrier-concentration are measured by Hall effect.
Field-effect experiments reveal a memory-dip that has a width compatible with
the carrier-concentration of the system as compared with previously studied
electron-glasses. It is observed that the common ingredient in all the systems
that exhibit electron-glass effects is high carrier-concentration suggesting
that their localized sites may be multi-occupied even when deep into the
insulating regime. That lightly-doped semiconductors do not show intrinsic
electron-glass effects is consistent with this empirical observation. The
connection between the memory-dip and the Coulomb-gap is discussed in light of
these findings.

networks, facilitated by the availability of relational data and the
increasingly powerful computational resources that can be employed for their
analysis. Naturally, the study of real-world systems leads to highly complex
networks and a current challenge is to extract intelligible, simplified
descriptions from the network in terms of relevant subgraphs, which can provide
insight into the structure and function of the overall system.
  Sparked by seminal work by Newman and Girvan, an interesting line of research
has been devoted to investigating modular community structure in networks,
revitalising the classic problem of graph partitioning.
  However, modular or community structure in networks has notoriously evaded
rigorous definition. The most accepted notion of community is perhaps that of a
group of elements which exhibit a stronger level of interaction within
themselves than with the elements outside the community. This concept has
resulted in a plethora of computational methods and heuristics for community
detection. Nevertheless a firm theoretical understanding of most of these
methods, in terms of how they operate and what they are supposed to detect, is
still lacking to date.
  Here, we will develop a dynamical perspective towards community detection
enabling us to define a measure named the stability of a graph partition. It
will be shown that a number of previously ad-hoc defined heuristics for
community detection can be seen as particular cases of our method providing us
with a dynamic reinterpretation of those measures. Our dynamics-based approach
thus serves as a unifying framework to gain a deeper understanding of different
aspects and problems associated with community detection and allows us to
propose new dynamically-inspired criteria for community structure.

additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. This was accomplished using a
minimum mean-square error scaling and randomization to transform the AWGN
channel into a modulo-lattice additive noise channel of the same capacity. It
has been further shown that when operating at rates below capacity but above
the critical rate of the channel, there exists a rate-dependent scaling such
that the associated modulo-lattice channel attains the error exponent of the
AWGN channel. A geometric explanation for this result is developed. In
particular, it is shown how the geometry of typical error events for the
modulo-lattice channel coincides with that of a spherical code for the AWGN
channel.

a prethermalized state that can be described by perturbation theory and a
generalized Gibbs ensemble. Using these properties of the prethermalized state
we perturbatively derive a kinetic equation which becomes a quantum Boltzmann
equation in the scaling limit of vanishing interaction. Applying this to
interaction quenches in the fermionic Hubbard model we find that the momentum
distribution relaxes to the thermal prediction of statistical mechanics. For
not too large interaction, this two-stage scenario provides a quantitative
understanding of the time evolution leading from the initial pure via a
metastable prethermal to the final thermal state.

  begin?","Proceedings of the 33rd International Cosmic Ray Conference",,,"icrc2013-0156","astro-ph.SR astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Observationally, it is difficult to establish at what rigidity the modulation
of galactic cosmic rays (CRs) actually begins in the heliosphere. It should be
possible to do if the relevant local interstellar CR spectra were known and
reliable measurements were made between 10 GV and about 200 GV, inside and
outside the heliosphere. Numerical models for solar modulation studies are
based on simply assuming that CR modulation begins at a given spatial boundary
and at rigidities between 30 to 50 GV, usually handled as an initial condition.
The Stochastic Differential Equations approach to numerical modelling presents
the opportunity to determine the level of modulation from high to low
rigidities because an initial condition at a prescribed high rigidity is not
required. We present the results of such an approach and show the percentage
modulation of CR protons as a function of kinetic energy between 100 MeV and
250 GeV.

energy range from 1 MeV to 70 GeV. Below (0.8 plus minus 0.2) GeV it has a
power law form, E^-(1.55 plus minus 0.05), with E kinetic energy, which is
consistent with previous studies. This is derived from comparing Voyager 1
electron data observed during 2010 with a comprehensive modulation model.
However, reproducing the PAMELA electron spectrum observed at Earth during late
2006 and to address an unexpected increase in the electron spectrum between
about 2 GeV and up to about 20 GeV, a spectral index of -(3.3 plus minus 0.1)
instead of the reported -(3.18 plus minus 0.05) was found for this energy
range. This feature cannot be caused by solar modulation or any other process
inside the heliosphere.

  Genes","22 pages, 8 figures",,,,"stat.AP q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Genome-wide gene expression profiles, as measured with microarrays or RNA-Seq
experiments, have revolutionized biological and biomedical research by
providing a quantitative measure of the entire mRNA transcriptome. Typically,
researchers set up experiments where control samples are compared to a
treatment condition, and using the t-test they identify differentially
expressed genes upon which further analysis and ultimately biological discovery
from such experiments is based. Here we describe an alternative geometrical
approach to identify differentially expressed genes. We show that this
alternative method, called the Characteristic Direction, is capable of
identifying more relevant genes. We evaluate our approach in three case
studies. In the first two, we match transcription factor targets determined by
ChIP-seq profiling with differentially expressed genes after the same
transcription factor knockdown or over-expression in mammalian cells. In the
third case study, we evaluate the quality of enriched terms when comparing
normal epithelial cells with cancer stem cells. In conclusion, we demonstrate
that the Characteristic Direction approach is much better in calling the
significantly differentially expressed genes and should replace the widely
currently in used t-test method for this purpose. Implementations of the method
in MATLAB, Python and Mathematica are available at:

time can be consistently estimated when the support of the censoring time
contains the support of the survival time. In practice, however, this condition
can be easily violated because the follow-up of a study is usually within a
finite window. In this article we show that the mean survival time is still
estimable from a linear model when the support of some covariate(s) with
nonzero coefficient(s) is unbounded regardless of the length of follow-up. This
implies that the mean survival time can be well estimated when the covariate
range is wide in practice. The theoretical finding is further verified for
finite samples by simulation studies. Simulations also show that, when both
models are correctly specified, the linear model yields reasonable mean square
prediction errors and outperforms the Cox model, particularly with heavy

the density in the diffuse molecular clouds containing the molecules

calculations of the excitation rate coefficients indicate that the regions in
which CO is found have hydrogen predominantly in molecular form. We carry out
statistical equilibrium calculations using CO-H2 collision rates to solve for
the H2 density in the observed sources without including effects of radiative
trapping. We have assumed kinetic temperatures of 50 K and 100 K, finding this
choice to make relatively little difference to the lowest transition. For the
sources having T_ex(1-0) only, for which we could determine upper and lower
density limits, we find <n(H2)> = 49 cm-3. While we can find a consistent
density range for a good fraction of the sources having either two or three
values of the excitation temperature, there is a suggestion that the higher-J
transitions are sampling clouds or regions within diffuse molecular cloud
material that have higher densities than the material sampled by the J = 1-0
transition. The assumed kinetic temperature and derived H2 density are
anticorrelated when the J = 2-1 transition data, the J = 3-2 transition data,
or both are included. For sources with either two or three values of the
excitation temperature, we find average values of the midpoint of the density
range that is consistent with all of the observations equal to 68 cm-3 for T_k
= 100 K and 92 cm-3 for T_k = 50 K. The data for this set of sources imply that
diffuse molecular clouds are characterized by an average thermal pressure

projection step involves an anti-dissipative mechanism allowing to prevent
numerical diffusion of the material interfaces. The proposed solver is built
ensuring in one hand consistency and stability properties and in other hand
that the sum of the color functions remains equal to one. The resulting scheme
is first order accurate and conservative for the mass, momentum, energy and
partial masses. Furthermore, the obtained dis- cretization preserves Riemann

supercontinuum generator. The device operation relies on ultrahigh Raman and

framework to evaluate disparate qubit-gating schemes on an equal footing. We
apply the procedure to two types of double-dot qubits: the singlet-triplet (ST)
and the semiconducting quantum dot hybrid qubit. We investigate three quantum
gates that flip the qubit state: a DC pulsed gate, an AC gate based on logical
qubit resonance (LQR), and a gate-like process known as stimulated Raman
adiabatic passage (STIRAP). These gates are all mediated by an exchange
interaction that is controlled experimentally using the interdot tunnel
coupling $g$ and the detuning $\epsilon$, which sets the energy difference
between the dots. Our procedure has two steps. First, we optimize the gate
fidelity ($f$) for fixed $g$ as a function of the other control parameters;
this yields an $f^\text{opt}(g)$ that is universal for different types of
gates. Next, we identify physical constraints on the control parameters; this
yields an upper bound $f^\text{max}$ that is specific to the qubit-gate
combination. We show that similar gate fidelities ($ \sim 99.5$%) should be
attainable for ST qubits in isotopically purified Si, and for hybrid qubits in
natural Si. Considerably lower fidelities are obtained for GaAs devices, due to
the fluctuating magnetic fields $\Delta B$ produced by nuclear spins.

arbitrarily close to those of the full information scheme. The analytical

understanding the properties of the low-lying $1/2^-$ $N^*$ and $\Delta$

vector mesons together with the octet baryons. The formalism is based on
obtaining the interactions from the lowest order chiral Lagrangian when dealing
with pseudoscalar mesons and relying on the hidden local symmetry in case of
the vector mesons. The transition between the two systems is obtained by
replacing the photon by a vector meson in the Kroll-Ruderman theorem for the
photoproduction of pseudoscalar mesons. The subtraction constants, required to
calculate the loop-function in the scattering equations, are constrained by
fitting the available experimental data on some of the reactions with
pseudoscalar meson-baryon final states. As a consequence, we find resonances
which can be related to $N^*(1535)$, $N^*(1650)$ (with a double pole
structure), $N^*(1895)$ and $\Delta(1620)$. We conclude that these resonances
can be, at least partly, interpreted as dynamically generated resonances and
that the vector mesons play an important role in determining the dynamical
origin of the low-lying $N^*$ and $\Delta$ states.

has been a source of debate in recent years, with two competing
interpretations: either the X-rays are of synchrotron origin, arising from a
different electron energy distribution than that producing the radio to optical
synchrotron component, or they are due to inverse Compton scattering of cosmic
microwave background photons (IC/CMB) by relativistic electrons in a powerful
relativistic jet with bulk Lorentz factor Gamma ~ 10-20. These two models imply
radically different conditions in the large-scale jet in terms of jet speed,
kinetic power, and maximum energy of the particle acceleration mechanism, with
important implications for the impact of the jet on the large-scale
environment. A large part of the X-ray origin debate has centered on the
well-studied source 3C 273. Here we present new observations from Fermi which
put an upper limit on the gamma-ray flux from the large-scale jet of 3C 273

IC/CMB X-ray model found by extrapolation of the UV to X-ray spectrum of knot

combined with previous work. Further, this upper limit from Fermi puts a limit
on the Doppler beaming factor of at least delta < 9, assuming equipartition
fields, and possibly as low as delta < 5, assuming no major deceleration of the

Although it has long been recognized that the meridional flow is predominantly
poleward at the Sun's surface and in its shallow interior, the location of the
equatorward return flow and the meridional flow profile in the deeper interior
remain unclear. Using the first two years of continuous helioseismology
observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory / Helioseismic Magnetic
Imager, we analyze travel times of acoustic waves that propagate through
different depths of the solar interior carrying information about the solar
interior dynamics. After removing a systematic center-to-limb effect in the
helioseismic measurements and performing inversions for flow speed, we find
that the poleward meridional flow of a speed of 15 m/s extends in depth from
the photosphere to about 0.91 R_sun. An equatorward flow of a speed of 10 m/s
is found between 0.82 to 0.91 R_sun in the middle of the convection zone. Our
analysis also shows evidence of that the meridional flow turns poleward again
below 0.82 R_sun, indicating an existence of a second meridional circulation
cell below the shallower one. This double-cell meridional circulation profile
with an equatorward flow shallower than previously thought suggests a
rethinking of how magnetic field is generated and redistributed inside the Sun.

consistent with a change in jet direction but not jet speed. The proper motions
of the radio knots match the kinematic model only if the distance to SS 433 is

early-type baryonic galaxies. This family is found to contain a large class of
models such as the hypervirial family (which satisfy the virial theorem
locally), the Plummer and Hernquist models and Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW)-like
models. The potential--density pair for these models are derived, as well as
their velocity dispersions and anisotropy parameters. The projected quantities
are computed and found to reduce to analytical expressions in some cases. The
first section of this paper presents an extension of the two-term anisotropic
polytropes to encompass a very wide range of potential-density pairs. In the
next section, we present the general relativistic extension of the
potential-density pair, and calculate the stress-energy tensor, the
relativistic anisotropy parameter, the velocity of circular orbits and the
angular momentum. Remarkably, for the case of the hypervirial family, the
relativistic pressure in the Newtonian limit and the relativistic anisotropy
parameter are found to coincide with the corresponding Newtonian expressions.
The weak, dominant and strong energy conditions are found to be satisfied only
for a certain range of the free parameters. We show that the relativistic
hypervirial family also has a finite total mass like its Newtonian counterpart.
In the first appendix, a relativistic extension of a different hypervirial
family of models is studied, and the relativistic anisotropy parameter is found
to coincide with the Newtonian one. Finally, we present a family of models
obtained from our distribution function that are similar to the
Ossipkov-Merritt models; by computing their anisotropy parameters, we show that
they model systems with isotropic cores and radially anisotropic exteriors.

of massive stars. Determining the nature of their progenitors is a crucial step
towards understanding the properties of SNe. Until recently, no progenitor has
been directly detected for SN of type Ibc, which are believed to come from
massive stars that lose their hydrogen envelope through stellar winds and from
binary systems where the companion has stripped the H envelope from the
primary. Here we analyze recently reported observations of iPTF13bvn, which
could possibly be the first detection of a SN Ib progenitor based on
pre-explosion images. Very interestingly, the recently published Geneva models
of single stars can reproduce the observed photometry of the progenitor
candidate and its mass-loss rate, confirming a recently proposed scenario. We
find that a single WR star with initial mass in the range 31-35 Msun fits the
observed photometry of the progenitor of iPTF13bvn. The progenitor likely has a
luminosity of log (L/Lsun)~5.55, surface temperature ~45000 K, and mass of
~10.9 Msun at the time of explosion. Our non-rotating 32 Msun model
overestimates the derived radius of the progenitor, although this could likely
be reconciled with a fine-tuned model of a more massive (between 40 and 50
Msun), hotter, and luminous progenitor. Our models indicate a very uncertain
ejecta mass of ~8 Msun, which is higher than the average of the SN Ib ejecta
mass that is derived from the lightcurve (2-4 Msun). This possibly high ejecta
mass could produce detectable effects in the iPTF13bvn lightcurve and spectrum.
If the candidate is indeed confirmed to be the progenitor, our results suggest
that stars with relatively high initial masses (>30 Msun) can produce visible
SN explosions at their deaths and do not collapse directly to a black hole.

Msun. The H2 emission line shows an increase in velocity dispersion along the
minor axis in both directions, and an increased flux with negative velocities
in the southeast direction; this provides direct evidence for a collimated
molecular outflow along the axis of rotation of the disk. The third spatially
distinct component appears to the southeast, 640 and 750 pc from the north and
southwest nuclei, respectively. This component is faint in continuum emission
but shows several strong emission line features, including [Si vi] 1.964 {\mu}m
which traces an extended coronal-line region. The geometry of the [Si vi]
emission combined with shock models and energy arguments suggest that [Si vi]
in the southeast component must be at least partly ionized by the SW AGN or a
putative AGN in the northern disk, either through photoionization or through
shock-heating from strong AGN- and circumnuclear starburst-driven outflows.
This lends support to a scenario in which Mrk 273 may be a dual AGN system.

or peanut-shaped galactic bulges. The X-shape is caused by the 2:1 vertical
Lindblad resonance with the bar, with two vertical oscillation periods per
orbital period in the bar frame. We examine N-body simulations and find that
due to the bar slowing down and disk thickening during bar buckling, the
resonance and associated peanut-shape moves outward. The peanut-shape is
consistent with the location of the vertical resonance, independent of whether
the bar buckled or not. We estimate the resonance width from the potential m=4
Fourier component and find that the resonance is narrow, affecting orbits over
a narrow range in the angular momentum distribution, dL/L ~ 0.05. As the
resonance moves outward, stars originally in the mid plane are forced out of
the mid plane into orbits just within the resonance separatrix. The height of
the separatrix orbits, estimated from the Hamiltonian model, is approximately
consistent with the peanut-shape height. The X-shape is comprised of stars in
the vicinity of the resonance separatrix. The velocity distributions from the
simulations illustrate that low inclination orbits are depleted within
resonance. Within resonance, the vertical velocity distribution is broad,
consistent with resonant heating caused by the passage of the resonance through
the disk. In the Milky Way bulge we relate the azimuthally averaged mid-plane
mass density near the vertical resonance to the rotation curve and bar pattern
speed. At an estimated vertical resonance galactocentric radius of ~1.3 kpc, we
confirm a mid-plane density of ~5x10^8 Msol/kpc^3, consistent with recently
estimated mass distributions. We find that the rotation curve, bar pattern
speed, 2:1 vertical resonance location, X-shape tips, and mid-plane mass
density, are all self-consistent in the Milky Way galaxy bulge.

would be consistent with those of young PMS objects (< 1 Myr) whose radiation
is heavily obscured by a circumstellar disc seen at high inclination and in
small part scattered towards the observer by the back side of the disc.
However, using theoretical models it is shown here that objects of this type
can only account for a few percent of this population. In fact, the spatial
distribution of these objects, their X-ray luminosities, their optical
brightness, their positions in the colour-magnitude diagram and the weak Li
absorption lines of the stars studied spectroscopically suggest that most of

is frequently modelled with a parametric model using polynomials in the cosine
of the angle between the line of sight and the emergent intensity.
Two-parameter laws are particularly popular for cases where one wishes to fit
freely for the limb darkening coefficients (i.e. an uninformative prior) due to
the compact prior volume and the fact that more complex models rarely obtain
unique solutions with present data. In such cases, we show that the two limb
darkening coefficients are constrained by three physical boundary conditions,
describing a triangular region in the two-dimensional parameter space. We show
that uniformly distributed samples may be drawn from this region with optimal
efficiency by a technique developed by computer graphical programming:
triangular sampling. Alternatively, one can make draws using a uniform,
bivariate Dirichlet distribution. We provide simple expressions for these
parametrizations for both techniques applied to the case of quadratic,
square-root and logarithmic limb darkening laws. For example, in the case of
the popular quadratic law, we advocate fitting for q_1 = (u_1+u_2)^2 and q_2 =
0.5u_1(u_1+u_2)^{-1} with uniform priors in the interval [0,1] to implement
triangular sampling easily. Employing these parametrizations allows one to
derive model parameters which fully account for our ignorance about the
intensity profile, yet never explore unphysical solutions, yielding robust and
realistic uncertainty estimates. Furthermore, in the case of triangular
sampling with the quadratic law, our parametrization leads to significantly
reduced mutual correlations and provides an alternative geometric explanation
as to why naively fitting the quadratic limb darkening coefficients
precipitates strong correlations in the first place.

decomposed into parts corresponding to Newton-like, incoming and outgoing
wavelike field components. It is shown here that this one-to-one correspondence
does not hold for space-time geometries with cylindrical isometries. This is
done by investigating some well-known exact solutions of Einstein's field
equations with whole-cylindrical symmetry, for which the physical
interpretation is very clear, but for which the standard Weyl interpretation
would give contradictory results. For planar or spherical geometries, however,
the standard interpretation works for both, static and dynamical space-times.
It is argued that one reason for the failure in the cylindrical case is that
for waves spreading in two spatial dimensions there is no local criterion to
distinguish incoming and outgoing waves already at the linear level. It turns
out that Thorne's local energy notion, subject to certain qualifications,
provides an efficient diagnostic tool to extract the proper physical

selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs). This sample contains the highest mass
black holes (BHs) at this redshift. Ten of the objects were detected by
Herschel and five show emission that is not associated with the AGNs. The star
formation (SF) luminosity (LSF) obtained by fitting the spectral energy
distribution (SED) with standard SF templates is in the range 10^(46.62-47.21)
erg/s corresponding to SF rates of 1090-4240 Msun/yr. Fitting with luminous
submillimeter galaxy SEDs gives SF rates that are smaller by 0.05 dex when
using all bands and 0.1 dex when ignoring the 250-mic band. A 40K gray-body
fits to only the 500-mic fluxes reduce LSF by about a factor two. Stacking
analysis of 29 undetected sources give significant signals in all three bands.
A SF template fit indicates LSF=10^(46.19-46.23) erg/s depending on the assume
AGN contribution. A 40K fit to the stacked 500-mic flux gives LSF=10^(45.95)
erg/s. The mean BH mass (mbh) and AGN luminosity (LAGN) of the detected sources
are significantly higher than those of the undetected ones. The spectral
differences are seen all the way from UV to far infrared wavelengths. The mean
optical-UV spectra are similar to the ones predicted for thin accretion disks
around BHs with the measured masses and accretion rates. We suggest two
alternative explanations to the correlation of LSF, LAGN and mbh, one involving
no AGN feedback and the second a moderate feedback that affects, but not
totally quench SF in 3/4 of the sources. We compare our LSF and LAGN to lower
redshift samples and show a new correlation between LSF and mbh. We also
examine several rather speculative ideas about the host galaxy properties
including the possibility that the detected sources are above the SF mass
sequence (MS) at z=4.8, perhaps in mergers, and most of the undetected sources
are on the MS.

the mass of the star's helium core (5-8Msun). Here we show that this naturally
explains the typical masses of observed black holes and the gap between neutron
star and black hole masses without any fine-tuning of the SN mechanism beyond
having it fail in a mass range where many progenitor models have density
structures that make the explosions more likely to fail. There is no difficulty
including this ~20% population of failed SNe in any accounting of SN types over
the progenitor mass function. And, other than patience, there is no

two B-R color distribution scenarios: color distribution dependent on H
magnitude (H-Model) and color distribution based on object classification
(Class-Model). These synthetic B-R color distributions were modified to account
for observational flux biases. We compare our synthetic B-R distributions to
the observed 'Hot' and 'Cold' detected objects from the Canada-France Ecliptic

population color distribution rejects the H-Model, but is well described by the
Class-Model. The Cold objects reject the H-Model, but the Class-Model (while
not statistically rejected) also does not provide a compelling match for data.
Although we formally reject models where the structure of the color
distribution is a strong function of H magnitude, we also do not find that a
simple dependence of color distribution on orbit classification is sufficient
to describe the color distribution of classical KBOs.

lie below the 1FGL detection threshold in the more sensitive 2FGL and 1FHL

pulsations' phases to confirm the onset of the traveling wave regime for
harmonic pulsations with frequencies <~50 Omega_orbit, in agreement with
theoretical expectations. We present evidence that many pulsations that are not
harmonics of the orbital frequency correspond to modes undergoing simultaneous
nonlinear coupling to multiple linearly driven parent modes. Since coupling
among multiple modes can lower the threshold for nonlinear interactions,
nonlinear phenomena may be easier to observe in highly eccentric systems, where
broader arrays of driving frequencies are available. This may help to explain
why the observed amplitudes of the linear pulsations are much smaller than the
theoretical threshold for decay via three-mode coupling.

of it, all physical observables also experience some sharp modification in the

where confinement -deconfinement phase transition indeed happens precisely at
temperature T=T_c where $\theta$ dependence of the vacuum energy experiences a
sudden change in behaviour: from N^2\cos(\theta/N) at T<T_c to
\cos\theta\exp(-N) at T>T_c. This conjecture is also supported by recent
lattice studies. We employ this conjecture to study a possible phase transition
as a function of \kappa\equiv N_f/N from confinement to conformal phase in the
Veneziano limit N_f\sim N when number of flavours and colours are large, but
the ratio \kappa is finite. Technically, we consider an operator which gets its
expectation value solely from nonperturbative instaton effects. When \kappa
exceeds some critical value \kappa> \kappa_c the integral over instanton size
is dominated by small-size instatons, making the instanton computations
reliable with expected \exp(-N) behaviour. However, when \kappa<\kappa_c, the
integral over instaton size is dominated by large-size instantons, and the
instanton expansion breaks down. This regime with \kappa<\kappa_c corresponds
to the confinement phase. We also compute the variation of the critical
\kappa_c(T, \mu) when the temperature and chemical potential T, \mu \ll
\Lambda_{QCD} slightly vary. We also discuss the scaling

continuous formation of globular clusters over cosmic time and the concurrent
evolution of the galaxy stellar distribution allow us to construct a simple
model that matches the observed spatial and mass distributions of clusters in
the Galaxy and the giant elliptical galaxy M87. In order to compare with
observations, we model the effects of dynamical friction and dynamical
evolution, including stellar mass loss, tidal stripping of stars, and tidal
disruption of clusters by the growing galactic nucleus. We find that
inspiraling globular clusters form a dense central structure, with mass and
radius comparable to the typical values in observed nuclear star clusters
(NSCs) in late-type and low-mass early-type galaxies. The density contrast
associated with the NSC is less pronounced in giant elliptical galaxies. Our
results indicate that the NSC mass as a fraction of mass of the galaxy stellar
spheroid scales as M_NSC/M_* = 0.0025 M_{*,11}^{-0.5}. Thus disrupted globular
clusters could contribute most of the mass of NSCs in galaxies with stellar
mass below 10^{11} Msun. The inner part of the accumulated cluster may seed the
growth of a central black hole via stellar dynamical core collapse, thereby
relieving the problem of how to form luminous quasars at high redshift. The
seed black hole may reach about 10^5 Msun within 1 Gyr of the beginning of
globular cluster formation.

Standard Model to merge into a CFT at least one new ultraviolet (UV) scale is
required at which the couplings turn over from their usual Standard Model
running to the fixed point behavior. We argue that the Higgs mass is sensitive
to such a turn-over scale even if there are no associated massive particles and
the scale arises purely from dimensional transmutation. We demonstrate this
sensitivity to the turnover scale explicitly in toy models. Thus if scale
invariance is responsible for Higgs mass naturalness, then the transition to
CFT dynamics must occur near the TeV scale with observable consequences at
colliders. In addition, the UV fixed point theory in such a scenario must be
interacting because logarithmic running near a free fixed point constitutes
hard breaking of scale invariance and spoils the Higgs mass protection.

theoretical physics. An important step toward the solution of this problem is
the Polyakov's work on abelian confinement. The Georgi-Glashow model is a
natural testing ground for this mechanism which has been surprising us by its
richness and wide applicability. In this work, we shed light on two new aspects
of this model in 2+1 D. First, we develop a many-body description of the
effective degrees of freedom. Namely, we consider a non-relativistic gas of
W-bosons in the background of monopole-instanton plasma. Many-body treatment is
a standard toolkit in condensed matter physics. However, we add a new twist by
supplying the monopole-instantons as external background field. Using this
construction, we calculate the exact form of the potential between two electric
probes as a function of their separation. This potential is expressed in terms
of the Meijer-G function which interpolates between logarithmic and linear
behavior at small and large distances, respectively. Second, we develop a
systematic approach to integrate out the effect of the W-bosons at finite
temperature in the range 0<T<M_W, where M_W is the W-boson mass, starting from
the full relativistic partition function of the Georgi-Glashow model. Using a
heat kernel expansion that takes into account the non-trivial thermal holonomy,
we show that the partition function describes a three-dimensional two-component
Coulomb gas. We repeat our analysis using the many-body description which
yields the same result and provides a check on our formalism. At temperatures
close to the deconfinement temperature, the gas becomes essentially
two-dimensional recovering the partition function of the dual sine-Gordon model
that was considered in a previous work.

technological and social systems. The underlying structures are typically
complex and their most relevant organizational principle is the ordering of the
ties among the units they are made of according to a network displaying
hierarchical features. In spite of the abundant presence of hierarchy no
quantitative theoretical interpretation of the origins of a multi-level,
knowledge-based social network exists. Here we introduce an approach which is
capable of reproducing the emergence of a multi-levelled network structure
based on the plausible assumption that the individuals (representing the nodes
of the network) can make the right estimate about the state of their changing
environment to a varying degree. Our model accounts for a fundamental feature
of knowledge-based organizations: the less capable individuals tend to follow
those who are better at solving the problems they all face. We find that
relatively simple rules lead to hierarchical self-organization and the specific
structures we obtain possess the two, perhaps most important features of
complex systems: a simultaneous presence of adaptability and stability. In
addition, the performance (success score) of the emerging networks is
significantly higher than the average expected score of the individuals without
letting them copy the decisions of the others. The results of our calculations
are in agreement with a related experiment and can be useful from the point of
designing the optimal conditions for constructing a given complex social
structure as well as understanding the hierarchical organization of such
biological structures of major importance as the regulatory pathways or the
dynamics of neural networks.

the observed glitch activity in the Vela pulsar, we conduct a systematic
analysis of the dependence of the fractional moment of inertia of the inner
crustal neutrons on the stiffness of the nuclear symmetry energy at saturation
density $L$. We take into account both crustal entrainment and the fact that
only a fraction $Y_{\rm g}$ of the core neutrons may couple to the crust on the
glitch-rise timescale. We use a set of consistently-generated crust and core
compositions and equations-of-state which are fit to results of low-density
pure neutron matter calculations. When entrainment is included at the level
suggested by recent microscopic calculations and the core is fully coupled to
the crust, the model is only able to account for the Vela glitch activity for a
1.4$M_{\odot}$ star if the equation of state is particularly stiff $L>100$ MeV.
However, an uncertainty of about 10\% in the crust-core transition density and
pressure allows for the Vela glitch activity to be marginally accounted for in
the range $L\approx30-60$MeV consistent with a range of experimental results.
Alternatively, only a small amount of core neutrons need be involved. If less
than 50\% of the core neutrons are coupled to the crust during the glitch, we
can also account for the Vela glitch activity using crustal neutrons alone for
EOSs consistent with the inferred range of $L$. We also explore the possibility
of Vela being a high-mass neutron star, and of crustal entrainment being
reduced or enhanced relative to its currently predicted values.

this phase space can also be represented by continuous, piecewise-flat

three-cells glued together consistently. The geometry of each cell and the
manner in which they are glued is compatible with the choice of fluxes and

By studying the piecewise-flat geometries which minimize edge lengths, we show
that these angular momenta can be literally interpreted as the spin of the
edges: the geometries of all edges are necessarily helices. We also show that
the compatibility of the gluing maps with the holonomy data results in the same
conclusion. This shows that a spinning geometry represents a way to glue

specific aspects such as BS density, channel fading, average path loss and
interference, the model also captures relevant cooperation mechanisms including
user-centric BS clustering and channel-dependent cooperation activation. The
locations of all BSs are modeled by a Poisson point process. Using tools from
stochastic geometry, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
($\mathtt{SINR}$) distribution with cooperation is precisely characterized in a
generality-preserving form. The result is then applied to practical design
problems of recent interest. We find that increasing the network-wide BS
density improves the $\mathtt{SINR}$, while the gains increase with the path
loss exponent. For pilot-based channel estimation, the average spectral
efficiency saturates at cluster sizes of around $7$ BSs for typical values,
irrespective of backhaul quality. Finally, it is shown that intra-cluster
frequency reuse is favorable in moderately loaded cells with generous
cooperation activation, while intra-cluster coordinated scheduling may be
better in lightly loaded cells with conservative cooperation activation.

sets to explicit systems of tropical equations that are uniquely determined by
idempotent module theory. We then define a tropicalization functor that sends
closed subschemes of a toric variety over a ring R with non-archimedean
valuation to closed subschemes of the corresponding tropical toric variety.
Upon passing to the set of $\mathbb{T}$-points this reduces to Kajiwara-Payne's
extended tropicalization, and in the case of a projective hypersurface we show
that the scheme structure determines the multiplicities attached to the
top-dimensional cells. By varying the valuation, these tropicalizations form
algebraic families of $\mathbb{T}$-schemes parameterized by a moduli space of
valuations on R that we construct. For projective subschemes, the Hilbert

radio data, predicted by simulations, concerns the radio lateral distribution
function, since its slope is strongly correlated with Xmax. Recent comparison
between REAS3 simulations and LOPES data showed a significantly improved
agreement in the lateral distribution function and for this reason an analysis
on a possible LOPES mass signature through the slope method is promising.
Trying to reproduce a realistic case, proton and iron showers are simulated
with REAS3 using the LOPES selection information as input parameters. The
obtained radio lateral distribution slope is analyzed in detail. The lateral
slope method to look at the composition signature in the radio data is shown
here and a possible signature of mass composition in the LOPES data is
discussed.

and shared information have become valuable tools of multi-variable data
analysis. Information measures, like marginal entropies, mutual and
multi-information, have a number of significant advantages over more standard
statistical methods, like their reduced sensitivity to sampling limitations
than statistical estimates of probability densities. There are also interesting
applications of these measures to the theory of complexity and to statistical
mechanics. Their mathematical properties and relationships are therefore of
interest at several levels.
  Of the interesting relationships between common information measures, perhaps
none are more intriguing and as elegant as the duality relationships based on
Mobius inversions. These inversions are directly related to the lattices
(posets) that describe these sets of variables and their multi-variable
measures. In this paper we describe extensions of the duality previously noted
by Bell to a range of measures, and show how the structure of the lattice
determines fundamental relationships of these functions. Our major result is a
set of interlinked duality relations among marginal entropies, interaction
information, and conditional interaction information. The implications of these
results include a flexible range of alternative formulations of
information-based measures, and a new set of sum rules that arise from
path-independent sums on the lattice. Our motivation is to advance the
fundamental integration of this set of ideas and relations, and to show
explicitly the ways in which all these measures are interrelated through
lattice properties. These ideas can be useful in constructing theories of
complexity, descriptions of large scale stochastic processes and systems, and
in devising algorithms and approximations for computations in multi-variable
data analysis.

Alexander V. Voronel and Johannes V. Sengers performed breakthrough experiments

Voronel discovered that the isochoric heat capacity of argon becomes infinite
at the vapor-liquid critical point. Almost simultaneously, Sengers observed a
similar anomaly for the thermal conductivity of near-critical carbon dioxide.
The existence of these singularities was later proved to be universal for all
fluids. These experiments had a profound effect on the development of the
modern (scaling) theory of phase transitions, which is based on the diverging
fluctuations of the order parameter. In particular, the discovery of the
heat-capacity divergence at the critical point was a keystone for the
formulation of static scaling theory, while the discovery of the divergence of
the thermal conductivity played an important role in the formulation of dynamic
scaling and mode-coupling theory. Moreover, owing to the discoveries made by
Voronel and Sengers 50 years ago, critical phenomena in fluids have become an
integral part of contemporary condensed-matter physics.

Often, a key source of uncertainty in the behavior of complex computer models
is uncertainty due to unknown model input parameters. Statistical computer
model calibration is the process of inferring model parameter values, along
with associated uncertainties, from observations of the physical process and
from model outputs at various parameter settings. Observations and model
outputs are often in the form of high-dimensional spatial fields, especially in
the environmental sciences. Sound statistical inference may be computationally
challenging in such situations. Here we introduce a composite likelihood-based
approach to perform computer model calibration with high-dimensional spatial
data. While composite likelihood has been studied extensively in the context of
spatial statistics, computer model calibration using composite likelihood poses
several new challenges. We propose a computationally efficient approach for
Bayesian computer model calibration using composite likelihood. We also develop
a methodology based on asymptotic theory for adjusting the composite likelihood
posterior distribution so that it accurately represents posterior
uncertainties. We study the application of our new approach in the context of
calibration for a climate model.

between parallel processors on a network, can greatly dominate the cost of
computation, so algorithms that minimize communication are of interest.
Motivated by this, attainable lower bounds for the amount of communication
required by algorithms were established by several groups for a variety of
algorithms, including matrix computations. Prior work of
Ballard-Demmel-Holtz-Schwartz relied on a geometric inequality of Loomis and
Whitney for this purpose. In this paper the general theory of discrete
multilinear Holder-Brascamp-Lieb (HBL) inequalities is used to establish
communication lower bounds for a much wider class of algorithms. In some cases,
algorithms are presented which attain these lower bounds.
  Several contributions are made to the theory of HBL inequalities proper. The
optimal constant in such an inequality for torsion-free Abelian groups is shown
to equal one whenever it is finite. Bennett-Carbery-Christ-Tao had
characterized the tuples of exponents for which such an inequality is valid as
the convex polyhedron defined by a certain finite list of inequalities. The
problem of constructing an algorithm to decide whether a given inequality is on
this list, is shown to be equivalent to Hilbert's Tenth Problem over the
rationals, which remains open. Nonetheless, an algorithm which computes the
polyhedron itself is constructed.

difference (photometry parameters) for samples of AGN, the more reliable
relationship is determined for the multi-epoch observed individual mapped QSOs

much different central properties. The final confirmed results are as follows.
(1): No strong dependence of the optical spectral index on the continuum
luminosity can be found for all the 17 QSOs, besides two objects (PG 0026 and
PG 1613) having some weak trends (with $3\sigma$ confidence level) for the

brighter' is not so common. (2): There are much different damped intrinsic
variability time scales for the variability modes of the optical spectral index
and the continuum emission, through the well applied Damped Random Walk method
for the AGN variability. In other words, there are some different intrinsic
mechanisms controlling the variabilities of the optical spectral index and the
power law AGN continuum emission. Therefore, the much weak dependence of the

large sample sizes call for carefully re-examining the theoretical foundation
underlying commonly-used analytical tools. Here, we study the accuracy of the
coalescent, a central model for studying the ancestry of a sample of
individuals. The coalescent arises as a limit of a large class of random mating
models and it is an accurate approximation to the original model provided that
the population size is sufficiently larger than the sample size. We develop a
method for performing exact computation in the discrete-time Wright-Fisher
(DTWF) model and compare several key genealogical quantities of interest with
the coalescent predictions. For realistic demographic scenarios, we find that
there are a significant number of multiple- and simultaneous-merger events
under the DTWF model, which are absent in the coalescent by construction.
Furthermore, for large sample sizes, there are noticeable differences in the
expected number of rare variants between the coalescent and the DTWF model. To
balance the tradeoff between accuracy and computational efficiency, we propose
a hybrid algorithm that utilizes the DTWF model for the recent past and the
coalescent for the more distant past. Our results demonstrate that the hybrid
method with only a handful of generations of the DTWF model leads to a
frequency spectrum that is quite close to the prediction of the full DTWF

addressed via use of cooperating nodes who act as jammers to confound the
eavesdropper. This paper investigates an alternative solution, which assumes
the availability of a full duplex (FD) receiver. In particular, while receiving
data, the receiver transmits jamming noise to degrade the eavesdropper channel.
The proposed self-protection scheme eliminates the need for external helpers
and provides system robustness. For the case in which global channel state
information is available, we aim to design the optimal jamming covariance
matrix that maximizes the secrecy rate and mitigates loop interference
associated with the FD operation. We consider both fixed and optimal linear
receiver design at the destination, and show that the optimal jamming
covariance matrix is rank-1, and can be found via an efficient 1-D search. For
the case in which only statistical information on the eavesdropper channel is
available, the optimal power allocation is studied in terms of ergodic and
outage secrecy rates. Simulation results verify the analysis and demonstrate
substantial performance gain over conventional HD operation at the destination.

addressing the diagnosis of a premature aging disorder using images of cell
nuclei, as well as the phenotypes of two non-infectious uveitides (the ocular
manifestations of Beh\c{c}et's disease and sarcoidosis) based on multicolor
flow cytometry. In the former case, one nuclear shape measurement taken over a
group of 30 cells is sufficient to classify samples as healthy or diseased, in
agreement with usual laboratory practice. In the latter, our method is able to
identify a minimal set of 5 markers that accurately predict Beh\c{c}et's

distinction between these two diseases has been achieved. To obtain this clear
phenotypic signature, about one hundred CD8+ T cells need to be measured.
Beyond these specific cases, the approach proposed here is applicable to
datasets generated by other kinds of state-of-the-art and forthcoming

We show that this sensitivity can be used to design an effective mechanical

followed by an even brighter explosion in 2012. Its pre-2012 observations make
it the best documented SN progenitor in history, but have fueled debate about
the nature of its 2012 explosion --- whether it was a true SN or some type of
violent non-terminal event. Both could power shock interaction with
circumstellar material (CSM), but only a core-collapse SN provides a
self-consistent explanation. The persistent broad emission lines in the
spectrum require a relatively large ejecta mass, and a corresponding kinetic
energy of at least 10^51 erg, while the faint 2012a event is consistent with
published models of core-collapse SNe from compact (~60 R_Sun) blue
supergiants. The light curves of SN 2009ip and another Type IIn, SN 2010mc,
were nearly identical; we demonstrate that their spectra match as well, and
that both are standard SNe IIn. Our observations contradict the recent claim
that the late-time spectrum of SN 2009ip is returning to its progenitor's
LBV-like state, and we show that late-time spectra of SN 2009ip closely
resemble spectra of SN 1987A. Moreover, SN 2009ip's changing H-alpha equivalent
width after explosion matches behavior typically seen in core-collapse SNe IIn.
Several key facts about SN 2009ip and SN 2010mc argue strongly in favor of a
core-collapse interpretation, and make a non-terminal 10^50 erg event
implausible. The most straighforward and self-consistent interpretation is that
SN 2009ip was an initially faint core-collapse explosion of a blue supergiant
that produced about half as much 56-Ni as SN 1987A, with most of the peak
luminosity from CSM interaction.

in the 4 Myr-old cluster Tr37. With a well-studied solar-type population, Tr37
is a benchmark for disk evolution. We used low-resolution spectroscopy to
identify 141 members (78 new) and 64 probable members, mostly M-type stars.
H\alpha\ emission provides information about accretion. Optical, 2MASS,
Spitzer, and WISE data are used to trace the SEDs. We construct radiative
transfer models to explore the structures of full-disks, pre-transition,
transition, and dust-depleted disks. Including the new and previously known
members, we confirm that a substantial fraction (~2/5) of disks show signs of
evolution, either as radial dust evolution (transition/pre-transition disks) or
as a more global evolution (low small-dust masses, dust settling, and
weak/absent accretion signatures). Accretion is strongly dependent on the SED
type. About half of the transition objects are consistent with no accretion,
and dust-depleted disks have weak (or undetectable) accretion signatures,
especially among M-type stars. The analysis of accretion and disk structure
suggests a parallel evolution of dust and gas. We find several distinct classes
of evolved disks, based on SED type and accretion, pointing to different disk
dispersal mechanisms and probably different evolutionary paths. Dust depletion
and opening of inner holes appear to be independent processes: most transition
disks are not dust-depleted, and most dust-depleted disks do not require inner
holes. The differences in disk structure between M-type and solar-type stars in
Tr37 (4 Myr) are not as remarkable as in the young, sparse, Coronet cluster
(1-2 Myr), suggesting that other factors, like the environment/interactions,
are likely to play a role in the disk evolution and dispersal. Finally, we also
find some evidence of clumpy star formation or mini-clusters within Tr37.

  Sources","accepted to present in PIMRC-2013, London",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a novel joint decoding technique for distributed source-channel
(DSC) coded systems for transmission of correlated binary Markov sources over
additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels. In the proposed scheme,
relatively short-length, low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are
independently used to encode the bit sequences of each source. To reconstruct
the original bit sequence, a joint source-channel decoding (JSCD) technique is
proposed which exploits the knowledge of both temporal and source correlations.
The JSCD technique is composed of two stages, which are iteratively performed.
First, a sum-product (SP) decoder is serially concatenated with a BCJR decoder,
where the knowledge of source memory is utilized during {\em local (horizontal)
iterations}. Then, the estimate of correlation between the sources is used to
update the concatenated decoder during {\em global (vertical) iterations}.
Therefore, the correlation of the sources is assumed as side information in the
subsequent global iteration of each concatenated decoder. From the simulation
results of frame/bit error rate (FER/BER), we note that significant gains are
achieved by the proposed decoding scheme with respect to the case where the
correlation knowledge is not completely utilized at the decoder.

  Anomalies and Conformal Methods","Doctoral dissertation",,,,"hep-ph hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The principal goal of the physics of the fundamental interactions is to
provide a consistent description of the nature of the subnuclear forces, which
manifest in our universe, together with the gravitational force, in a unified
framework. This attempt, which is far from being complete, is characterized by
two milestones, the Standard Model of the elementary particles and the
Einstein's theory of General Relativity. The coupling of a quantum field
theory, such as the Standard Model, to a weak gravitational background provides
significant information concerning the coupling of matter to gravity and allows
to study in a systematic way the origin of the conformal anomaly. For this
reason, the computation of correlation functions in a weak gravitational
background is of remarkable interest and the consequences of this analysis are
also of phenomenological relevance. For instance, they concern the appearance
in the spectrum of the theory of a composite state, the dilaton, which is
identified, in perturbation theory, by an infrared coupled anomaly pole. The
study of some applications of the methods discussed so far is presented in the
second part of this thesis. In particular it is shown that the analysis of the
classical metric perturbations in gravity can be related to some specific field
theories via a holographic mapping. This requires the computation of
correlators of energy-momentum tensors in $d=3$ dimensions and plays a role in
the study of the non-gaussianities of the cosmic background radiation in the
early universe. Finally, we mention an application in momentum space of the
constraints derived from the conformal symmetry in the characterization of some
correlation functions. This relies on the solution of a system of second order
partial differential equations for a certain class of generalized
hypergeometric functions of two variables.

pooling process. In contrast, above a critical density we observe a dramatic
enhancement of the fluorescence from high-lying states that is not to be
expected from kinetic theory. We show that the density threshold for excitation
on the D1 and D2 resonance line corresponds to the value at which the
dipole-dipole interactions begins to dominate, thereby indicate the key role of
these interactions in the enhanced emission.

quantum systems. As a kind of quantum correlation, it is expected that
bipartite nonlocaity should be present in quantum systems, just as bipartite
entanglement does. Surprisingly, for various models, two-qubit states do not
violate Bell inequalities, i.e., they are local. Recently, it is realized that
the results are related to the monogamy trade-off obeyed by bipartite Bell
correlations, thus it is believed that for general translation invariant
systems, two-qubit states should not violate the Bell inequality(Oliveira, EPL

translation invariant systems, the Bell inequality can be violated. A

which takes into account the delay distribution function (DTD) of the explosion
times and a given star formation history is adopted. Then the chemical
evolution for ellipticals with baryonic initial masses $10^{10}$, $10^{11}$ and
$10^{12} M_{\odot}$ is computed, and the mass of Fe produced by each galaxy is
precisely estimated. We also compute the expected Fe mass ejected by
ellipticals in typical galaxy clusters (e.g. Coma and Virgo), under different
assumptions about Type Ia SN progenitors. As a last step, we compute the cosmic
Type Ia SN rate in an unitary volume of the Universe by adopting several cosmic
star formation rates and compare it with the available and recent observational
data. Unfortunately, no firm conclusions can be derived only from the cosmic
SNIa rate, neither on SNIa progenitors nor on the cosmic star formation rate.
Finally, by analysing all our results together, and by taking into account
previous chemical evolution results, we try to constrain the best Type Ia

the empirical bimodal model. All these models require the existence of prompt
Type Ia supernovae, exploding in the first 100 Myr since the beginning of star
formation, although their fraction should not exceed 15-20% in order to fit

The electronic conductance across strained junctions and barriers in graphene
nanoribbons is calculated numerically, with and without various types of
disorder, and comparing smooth and sharp strain junctions. A smooth strain
barrier in graphene is seen to be generically as efficient in suppressing
transport at low densities as a sharp one, and the critical density (or energy)
for the onset of transmission depends on the strain orientation with respect to
the ribbon. In addition, hopping (or strain) inhomogeneity and work function
mismatch at the interface region do not visibly degrade the transport gap.
These results show that the strain-induced transport gap at a strain junction
is robust to more realistic strain conditions.

feature observed during the Asian Summer Monsoon. It is generally assumed that
Tibet is an essential ingredient in determining the location of the TEJ.
However studies have also suggested the importance of latent heating in
determining the jet location. The relative importance of Tibetan orography and
latent heating is explored through simulations with a general circulation
model.
  The simulation of TEJ by the Community Atmosphere Model, version 3.1
(CAM-3.1) has been discussed in detail. Although the simulated TEJ replicated
many observed features of the jet, the jet maximum was located too far to the
west when compared to observation. The precipitation in the control simulation
was high to the west of India and this caused the TEJ to shift westwards by
approximately the same amount. Orography was found to have minimal impact on
the simulated TEJ hence indicating that latent heating is the crucial
parameter. The primacy of latent heating in determining the jet location was
confirmed by additional simulations where the simulated precipitation was
brought closer to observations. This made the TEJ to also shift to the correct
position.

are distributed across multiple processing elements. Balancing the load of the
processing elements is key to achieving good performance and scalability. If
the computational costs of the individual tasks vary over time in an
unpredictable way, dynamic load balancing aims at migrating them between
processing elements so as to maintain load balance. During dynamic load
balancing, the tasks amount to indivisible work packets with a real-valued
cost. For this case of indivisible, real- valued loads, we analyze the
balancing circuit model, a local dynamic load-balancing scheme that does not
require global communication. We extend previous analyses to the present case
and provide a probabilistic bound for the achievable load balance. Based on an
analogy with the offline balls-into-bins problem, we further propose a novel
algorithm for dynamic balancing of indivisible, real-valued loads. We benchmark
the proposed algorithm in numerical experiments and compare it with the
classical greedy algorithm, both in terms of solution quality and communication
cost. We find that the increased communication cost of the proposed algorithm
is compensated by a higher solution quality, leading on average to about an
order of magnitude gain in overall performance.

topological insulator with states of topological character located in a clean,
bulk electronic gap, namely the Kondo hybridisation gap. Seeing as the Kondo
gap arises from many body electronic correlations, this would place SmB6 at the
head of a new material class: topological Kondo insulators. Here, for the first
time, we show that the k-space characteristics of the Kondo hybridisation
process is the key to unravelling the origin of the two types of metallic
states observed directly by ARPES in the electronic band structure of
SmB6(001). One group of these states is essentially of bulk origin, and cuts
the Fermi level due to the position of the chemical potential 20 meV above the
lowest lying 5d-4f hybridisation zone. The other metallic state is more
enigmatic, being weak in intensity, but represents a good candidate for a
topological surface state. However, before this claim can be substantiated by
an unequivocal measurement of its massless dispersion relation, our data raises
the bar in terms of the ARPES resolution required, as we show there to be a
strong renormalisation of the hybridisation gaps by a factor 2-3 compared to
theory, following from the knowledge of the true position of the chemical
potential and a careful comparison with the predictions from recent
LDA+Gutzwiler calculations. All in all, these key pieces of evidence act as
triangulation markers, providing a detailed description of the electronic
landscape in SmB6, pointing the way for future, ultrahigh resolution ARPES
experiments to achieve a direct measurement of the Dirac cones in the first
topological Kondo insulator.

strong sd coupling without spin relaxation (adiabatic limit), the spin electric
and magnetic fields are determined by calculating transport properties. The
spin electromagnetic fields turn out to be expressed in terms of a
Rashba-induced effective vector potential, and thus they satisfy the Maxwell's

Rashba-induced one is linear in the gradient of magnetization profile, and thus
can be extremely large even for slowly varying structures. We show that the

non-identical particles, Feynman concluded: ""We have the result that it is
twice as likely to find two identical Bose particles scattered into the same

Indeed, in most scenarios, this reasoning is valid, however, as it is shown in
this paper, there are cases, even in the most ordinary scattering scenarios,
where this reasoning is invalid, and in fact the opposite occurs: boson
anti-bunching appears. Similarly, it is shown that at exactly the same

that they have on the capacity of the network (defined as the maximum number of
simultaneously satisfiable links). For example, it has been shown that giving
receivers the ability to do interference cancellation, or allowing transmitters
to use power control, never decreases the capacity and can in certain cases
increase it by $\Omega(\log (\Delta \cdot P_{\max}))$, where $\Delta$ is the
ratio of the longest link length to the smallest transmitter-receiver distance
and $P_{\max}$ is the maximum transmission power. But there is no reason to
expect the optimal capacity to be realized in practice, particularly since
maximizing the capacity is known to be NP-hard. In reality, we would expect
links to behave as self-interested agents, and thus when introducing a new
technology it makes more sense to compare the values reached at game-theoretic
equilibria than the optimum values.
  In this paper we initiate this line of work by comparing various notions of
equilibria (particularly Nash equilibria and no-regret behavior) when using a
supposedly ""better"" technology. We show a version of Braess's Paradox for all
of them: in certain networks, upgrading technology can actually make the
equilibria \emph{worse}, despite an increase in the capacity. We construct
instances where this decrease is a constant factor for power control,
interference cancellation, and improvements in the SINR threshold ($\beta$),
and is $\Omega(\log \Delta)$ when power control is combined with interference
cancellation. However, we show that these examples are basically tight: the
decrease is at most O(1) for power control, interference cancellation, and
improved $\beta$, and is at most $O(\log \Delta)$ when power control is
combined with interference cancellation.

Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) incompressible turbulence with the Boussinesq
approximation. An ensemble of 100 independent realizations were performed at
small Atwood number and unit Prandtl number with a spatial resolution of
$2048\times8193$ grid points. Our main focus is on the temporal evolution and
the scaling behavior of global quantities and of small-scale turbulence
properties. Our results show that the buoyancy force balances the inertial
force at all scales below the integral length scale and thus validate the basic
force-balance assumption of the Bolgiano-Obukhov scenario in 2D RT turbulence.
It is further found that the Kolmogorov dissipation scale $\eta(t)\sim
t^{1/8}$, the kinetic-energy dissipation rate $\varepsilon_u(t)\sim t^{-1/2}$,
and the thermal dissipation rate $\varepsilon_{\theta}(t)\sim t^{-1}$. All of
these scaling properties are in excellent agreement with the theoretical
predictions of the Chertkov model [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{91}, 115001
(2003)]. We further discuss the emergence of intermittency and anomalous
scaling for high order moments of velocity and temperature differences. The
scaling exponents $\xi^r_p$ of the $p$th-order temperature structure functions
are shown to saturate to $\xi^r_{\infty}\simeq0.78\pm0.15$ for the highest
orders, $p\sim10$. The value of $\xi^r_{\infty}$ and the order at which
saturation occurs are compatible with those of turbulent Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard

LHOM(H) admits a logspace algorithm, and otherwise LHOM(H) is hard for NL. Our
algorithm operates by reducing the lists in a complex manner based on a novel
decomposition of an auxiliary digraph, combined with repeated applications of
Reingold's algorithm for undirected reachability (2005). We also prove an
algebraic version of this dichotomy: the digraphs without a circular N are
precisely those that admit a finite chain of polymorphisms satisfying the

Observatory were subject to the same Broadening Function processing to
determine the combined line strength in the spectral window centered on the MgI
triplet (5080-5285A). Individual integrated BF's were phase averaged to derive
a single line-strength indicator. The sample was limited to 90 EW binaries with
the strict phase-constancy of colors and without spectral contamination by
companions. The best defined results were obtained for a F-type sub-sample
(0.32<(B-V)0<0.62) of 52 stars for which the BF strengths could be interpolated
in the model predictions. The metallicities, [M/H], for the F-type sub-sample
indicate abundances roughly similar to the solar [M/H], but with a large
scatter which is partly due to combined random and systematic errors. Because
of a color trend resulting from limitations in our approach, we set the scale
of metallicities to correspond to that derived from the m_1 index of the
Stromgren photometry for F-type binaries. The trend-adjusted [M/H]1 are
distributed within -0.65<[M/H]1<+0.50, with the spread reflecting genuine
metallicity differences between stars. One half of the F-sub-sample binaries
have [M/H]1 within -0.37<[M/H]1 +0.10, a median of -0.04 and a mean of -0.10,
with a tail towards low metallicities, and a possible bias against very high
metallicities. A parallel study of kinematic data, utilizing the most reliable
and recently obtained proper motion and radial velocity data for 78 stars of
the full sample, shows that the F-type sub-sample binaries have similar
kinematic properties to solar neighborhood, thin-disk dwarfs with ages about 3
- 5.5 Gyr. The F-type binaries which appear to be older than the rest tend to
have systematically smaller mass-ratios than most of the EW binaries of the

algorithm that is asymptotically near-optimal. Namely, the solution extracted
from LBT-RRT converges to a solution that is within an approximation factor of
1+epsilon of the optimal solution. Our algorithm allows for a continuous
interpolation between the fast RRT algorithm and the asymptotically optimal
RRT* and RRG algorithms. When the approximation factor is 1 (i.e., no
approximation is allowed), LBT-RRT behaves like RRG. When the approximation
factor is unbounded, LBT-RRT behaves like RRT. In between, LBT-RRT is shown to
produce paths that have higher quality than RRT would produce and run faster
than RRT* would run. This is done by maintaining a tree which is a sub-graph of
the RRG roadmap and a second, auxiliary graph, which we call the lower-bound
graph. The combination of the two roadmaps, which is faster to maintain than
the roadmap maintained by RRT*, efficiently guarantees asymptotic
near-optimality. We suggest to use LBT-RRT for high-quality, anytime motion
planning. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm for scenarios ranging
from 3 to 12 degrees of freedom and show that even for small approximation
factors, the algorithm produces high-quality solutions (comparable to RRG and
RRT*) with little running-time overhead when compared to RRT.

massive planet. It can also be expected from dynamical models, that most of
Mars' building blocks consisted of material that formed in orbital locations
just beyond the ice line which could have contained ~0.1-0.2 wt. % of H2O. By
using these constraints, we estimate the nebula-captured and catastrophically
outgassed volatile contents during the solidification of Mars' magma ocean and
apply a hydrodynamic upper atmosphere model for the study of the soft X-ray and
extreme ultraviolet (XUV) driven thermal escape of the martian protoatmosphere
during the early active epoch of the young Sun. The amount of gas that has been
captured from the protoplanetary disk into the planetary atmosphere is
calculated by solving the hydrostatic structure equations in the protoplanetary
nebula. Depending on nebular properties such as the dust grain depletion
factor, planetesimal accretion rates and luminosities, hydrogen envelopes with
masses >=3x10^{19} g to <=6.5x10^{22} g could have been captured from the
nebula around early Mars. Depending of the before mentioned parameters, due to
the planets low gravity and a solar XUV flux that was ~100 times stronger
compared to the present value, our results indicate that early Mars would have
lost its nebular captured hydrogen envelope after the nebula gas evaporated,
during a fast period of ~0.1-7.5 Myr. After the solidification of early Mars'
magma ocean, catastrophically outgassed volatiles with the amount of ~50-250
bar H2O and ~10-55 bar CO2 could have been lost during ~0.4-12 Myr, if the

proposed in realistic patterned ferromagnetic thin films. Due to magnetic shape
anisotropy, magnetic moments in a thin film lie within the plane, while all
spin-wave excitations are fully gapped. Under an out-of-plane magnetic field,
the film acquires a finite magnetization, where some of the gapped magnons
become significantly softened near a saturation field. It is shown that, owing
to a spin-orbit locking nature of the magnetic dipolar interaction, these soft
spin-wave volume-mode bands become chiral volume-mode bands with finite
topological Chern integers. A bulk-edge correspondence in IQH physics suggests
that such volume-mode bands are accompanied by a chiral magnetostatic spin-wave
edge mode. The existence of the edge mode is justified both by micromagnetic
simulations and by band calculations based on a linearized Landau-Lifshitz
equation. Employing intuitive physical arguments, we introduce proper
tight-binding models for these soft volume-mode bands. Based on the
tight-binding models, we further discuss possible applications to other systems
such as magnetic ultrathin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA).

Euclidean space can be divided into n+1 parts of smaller diameter. The diameter
of a set is defined as the supremum (least upper bound) of the distances of
contained points. Implicitly, the whole set is assumed to contain at least two
points.
  The hypothesis that the answer to that question is positive became famous
under the name Borsuk's conjecture. Beginning with Jeff Kahn and Gil Kalai,
from 1993 to 2003 several authors have proved that in certain (almost all) high
dimensions such a division is not generally possible.
  In a paper published in 2013, Andriy V. Bondarenko constructed a
65-dimensional two-distance set of 416 vectors that cannot be divided into less
than 84 parts of smaller diameter. That was not just the first known
two-distance counterexample to Borsuk's conjecture but also a considerable
reduction of the lowest known dimension the conjecture fails in in general.
  This article presents a 64-dimensional subset of the vector set mentioned
above that cannot be divided into less than 71 (by A. Bondarenko 72) parts of
smaller diameter, that way delivering a two-distance counterexample to Borsuk's
conjecture in dimension 64.
  The contained proof relies on the results of some (combinatorial)
calculations. The additionally (in the source package) provided small computer
program G24CHK needs about one second for that task on a 1 GHz Intel PIII.
  Meanwhile a short paper by this author and Andries E. Brouwer that follows
the principal idea of this article but avoids the extensive computational part

single particle excitations. In the recent years, employment of sophisticated
techniques of gamma spectroscopy has led to observation of high spin states of
several nuclei near A$\simeq$ 40. In a few of them multiparticle, multihole
rotational states coexist with states of single particle nature. We have
studied a few nuclei in this mass region experimentally, using various
campaigns of the Indian National Gamma Array setup. We have compared and
combined our empirical observations with the large-scale shell model results to
interpret the structure of these nuclei. Indication of population of states of
large deformation has been found in our data. This gives us an opportunity to
investigate the interplay of single particle and collective degrees of freedom
in this mass region.

  (2012)",,,,"physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Photonic innovation is becoming ever more important in the modern world.
Optical systems are dominating shorter and shorter communications distances,
LED's are rapidly emerging for a variety of applications, and solar cells show
potential to be a mainstream technology in the energy space. The need for
novel, energy-efficient photonic and optoelectronic devices will only increase.
This work unites fundamental physics and a novel computational inverse design
approach towards such innovation.
  The first half of the dissertation is devoted to the physics of
high-efficiency solar cells. As solar cells approach fundamental efficiency
limits, their internal physics transforms. Photonic considerations, instead of
electronic ones, are the key to reaching the highest voltages and efficiencies.
Proper photon management led to Alta Device's recent dramatic increase of the
solar cell efficiency record to 28.3%. Moreover, approaching the
Shockley-Queisser limit for any solar cell technology will require light
extraction to become a part of all future designs.
  The second half of the dissertation introduces inverse design as a new
computational paradigm in photonics. An assortment of techniques (FDTD, FEM,
etc.) have enabled quick and accurate simulation of the ""forward problem"" of
finding fields for a given geometry. However, scientists and engineers are
typically more interested in the inverse problem: for a desired functionality,
what geometry is needed? Answering this question breaks from the emphasis on
the forward problem and forges a new path in computational photonics. The
framework of shape calculus enables one to quickly find superior, non-intuitive
designs. Novel designs for optical cloaking and sub-wavelength solar cell
applications are presented.

towards a state in which the nonlinearity is diminished. In fully developed
turbulence this tendency can be measured by comparing the variance of the
nonlinear term to the variance of the same quantity measured in a Gaussian
field with the same energy distribution. In order to study this phenomenon at
high Reynolds numbers, a version of the Direct Interaction Approximation is
used to obtain a closed expression for the statistical average of the
mean-square nonlinearity. The wavenumber spectrum of the mean-square nonlinear
term is evaluated and its scaling in the inertial range is investigated as a
function of the Reynolds number. Its scaling is dominated by the sweeping by
the energetic scales, but this sweeping is weaker than predicted by a random
sweeping estimate. At inertial range scales, the depletion of nonlinearity as a
function of the wavenumber is observed to be constant. At large it is observed
that the mean-square nonlinearity is larger than its Gaussian estimate, which
is shown to be related to the non-Gaussianity of the Reynolds-stress
fluctuations at these scales.

granted that this sequence can be connected by a moving pole in the complex
angular momentum (CAM) plane, which gives rise to a linear trajectory of the
form $J = \alpha_0+\alpha' m^2$, $\alpha'\sim 1/(\mathrm{GeV})^2$, which is the
standard expression of the Regge pole trajectory. But the phenomenology shows
that only the first few resonances lie on a trajectory of this type. For higher
$J^p$ this rule is violated and is substituted by the relation $J\sim kR$,
where $k$ is the pion--nucleon c.m.s.-momentum, and $R\sim 1$ fm. In this
article we prove: (a) Starting from a non-relativistic model of the proton,
regarded as composed by three quarks confined by harmonic potentials, we prove
that the first three members of this $\pi^+$-p resonance sequence can be
associated with a vibrational spectrum of the proton generated by an algebra
$Sp(3,R)$. Accordingly, these first three members of the sequence can be
described by Regge poles and lie on a standard linear trajectory. (b) At higher
energies the amplitudes are dominated by diffractive scattering, and the
creeping waves play a dominant role. They can be described by a second class of
poles, which can be called Sommerfeld's poles, and lie on a line nearly
parallel to the imaginary axis of the CAM-plane. (c) The Sommerfeld pole which
is closest to the real axis of the CAM-plane is dominant at large angles, and
describes in a proper way the backward diffractive peak in both the following
cases: at fixed $k$, as a function of the scattering angle, and at fixed
scattering angle $\theta=\pi$, as a function of $k$. (d) The evolution of this
pole, as a function of $k$, is given in first approximation by $J\simeq kR$.

observed neutrinos obtain mass from a vacuum expectation value which is much
smaller than the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs boson in the Standard

coupling is directly related to the neutrino mass (i.e. a ""neutrinophilic

neutrino (H^- to l^- nu) depend identically on the neutrino masses and mixings
in the two models. We quantify the impact of the recent measurement of
sin^2(2theta_{13}), which plays a crucial role in determining the magnitude of
the branching ratio of H^- to e^- nu for the case of a normal neutrino mass
ordering if the lightest neutrino mass m_0 < 10^{-3} eV. We also discuss the
sizeable dependence of H^- to mu^- nu and H^- to tau^- nu on sin^2(theta_{23}),
which would enable information to be obtained on sin^2(theta_{23}) and the sign
of \Delta m^2_{31} if these decays are measured. Such information would help
neutrino oscillation experiments to determine the CP-violating phase \delta.

The instrument contains 2317 single-polarization, horn-coupled, aluminum

detector readout system is based on the ROACH-1 board, and the detectors will
be biased below 300 MHz. The detector array is fed by an F/2.4 crossed-Dragone
telescope with a 500 mm aperture yielding a 15 arcmin FWHM beam at 150 GHz. To
minimize detector loading and maximize sensitivity, the entire optical system
will be cooled to 1 K. Linearly polarized sky signals will be modulated with a

rotated by a superconducting magnetic bearing. The observation program consists
of at least two, five-day flights beginning with the 150 GHz observations.

outreach mechanism. Previous research has suggested the importance of the first
day to the ultimate success of a petition, but has not examined early growth
within that day, made possible here through hourly resolution in the data. The
analysis shows that the vast majority of petitions do not achieve any measure
of success; over 99 percent fail to get the 10,000 signatures required for an
official response and only 0.1 percent attain the 100,000 required for a
parliamentary debate (0.7 percent in the US). We analyze the data through a
multiplicative process model framework to explain the heterogeneous growth of
signatures at the population level. We define and measure an average outreach
factor for petitions and show that it decays very fast (reducing to 0.1 pervent
after 10 hours in the UK and 30 hours in the US). After a day or two, a
petition's fate is virtually set. The findings challenge conventional analyses
of collective action from economics and political science, where the production

tensor product of modules over $R$ and the twist map for the tensor product of
any two $R$-modules. Similar constructions are available in braided monoidal
categories and Azumaya algebras were defined in these settings. Here we
introduce Azumaya monads on any category $\A$ by considering a monad $\bF$ on
$\A$ endowed with a distributive law $\lambda: FF\to FF$ satisfying the
Yang-Baxter equation (BD-law). This allows to introduce an {\em opposite monad}
$\bF^\la$ and a monad structure on $FF^\la$. For an {\em Azumaya monad} we
impose the condition that the canonical comparison functor induces an
equivalence between the category $\A$ and the category of $\bF\bF^\la$-modules.
Properties and characterisations of these monads are studied, in particular for
the case when $F$ allows for a right adjoint functor. Dual to Azumaya monads we
define {\em Azumaya comonads} and investigate the interplay between these
notions.
  In braided categories $(\V,\ot,I,\tau)$, for any $\V$-algebra $A$, the
braiding induces a BD-law $\tau_{A,A}:A\ot A\to A\ot A$ and $A$ is called left
(right) Azumaya, provided the monad $A\ot-$ (resp. $-\ot A$) is Azumaya. If
$\tau$ is a symmetry, or if the category $\V$ admits equalisers and
coequalisers, the notions of left and right Azumaya algebras coincide. The
general theory provides the definition of coalgebras in $\V$. Given a
cocommutative $\V$-coalgebra $\bD$, coalgebras $\bC$ over $\bD$ are defined as
coalgebras in the monoidal category of $\bD$-comodules and we describe when
these have the Azumaya property. In particular, over commutative rings $R$, a
coalgebra $C$ is Azumaya if and only if the dual $R$-algebra $C^*=\Hom_R(C,R)$
is an Azumaya algebra.

zero-field Fermi surfaces are large for these $x$, and oscillation frequencies
conform with such Fermi surfaces. However, the amplitude of these oscillations
is modulated with a frequency which is smaller by an order of magnitude. The
appearance of this modulation is related to van Hove singularities in the
Landau subbands, which traverse the Fermi level with changing $B$. The
singularities are connected with bending the Landau subbands due to strong
electron correlations. The frequency of the modulation is of the same order of

signatures of neutral hydrogen escaping the planets. We present a 3D particle
model of the dynamics of the escaping atoms, and calculate theoretical Ly-alpha
absorption line profiles, which can be directly compared with the absorption
observed in the blue wing of the line. For HD209458b the observed velocities of
the escaping atoms up to -130km/s are naturally explained by radiation-pressure
acceleration. The observations are well-fitted with an ionizing flux of about
3-4 times solar and a hydrogen escape rate in the range 10^9-10^11g/s, in
agreement with theoretical predictions. For HD189733b absorption by neutral
hydrogen was observed in 2011 in the velocity range -230 to -140km/s. These
velocities are higher than for HD209458b and require an additional acceleration
mechanism for the escaping hydrogen atoms, which could be interactions with
stellar wind protons. We constrain the stellar wind (temperature ~3x10^4K,
velocity 200+-20km/s and density in the range 10^3-10^7/cm3) as well as the
escape rate (4x10^8-10^11g/s) and ionizing flux (6-23 times solar). We also
reveal the existence of an 'escape-limited' saturation regime in which most of
the escaping gas interacts with the stellar protons. In this regime, which
occurs at proton densities above ~3x10^5/cm3, the amplitude of the absorption
signature is limited by the escape rate and does not depend on the wind
density. The non-detection of escaping hydrogen in earlier observations in 2010
can be explained by the suppression of the stellar wind at that time, or an
escape rate of about an order of magnitude lower than in 2011. For both
planets, best-fit simulations show that the escaping atmosphere has the shape
of a cometary tail.

planets have been discovered. The existence of bound and unbound terrestrial
planets with liquid water is an important question, and of particular
importance is the question of their habitability. Even for a globally
ice-covered planet, geothermal heat from the planetary interior may melt the
interior ice, creating an internal ocean covered by an ice shell. In this
paper, we discuss the conditions that terrestrial planets must satisfy for such
an internal ocean to exist on the timescale of planetary evolution. The
question is addressed in terms of planetary mass, distance from a central star,
water abundance, and abundance of radiogenic heat sources. In addition, we
investigate the structures of the surface-H2O layers of ice-covered planets by
considering the effects of ice under high pressure (high-pressure ice). As a
fiducial case, 1M$\oplus$ planet at 1 AU from its central star and with 0.6 to
25 times the H2O mass of Earth could have an internal ocean. We find that
high-pressure ice layers may appear between the internal ocean and the rock
portion on a planet with an H2O mass over 25 times that of Earth. The planetary
mass and abundance of surface water strongly restrict the conditions under
which an extrasolar terrestrial planet may have an internal ocean with no
high-pressure ice under the ocean. Such high-pressure-ice layers underlying the
internal ocean are likely to affect the habitability of the planet.

investigation of lattice correlated systems beyond the conventional on-site
Hubbard approximation, by possibly including multi-particle processes. We study
fermionic extended Hubbard models in a one dimensional lattice with different
types of particle couplings, including also three- and four-body interaction up
to nearest neighboring sites. By using the Bosonization technique, we
investigate the low-energy regime and determine the conditions for the
appearance of ordered phases, for arbitrary particle filling. We find that
three- and four-body couplings may significantly modify the phase diagram. In
particular, diagonal three-body terms that directly couple the local particle
densities have qualitatively different effects from off-diagonal three-body
couplings originating from correlated hopping, and favor the appearance of a
Luther-Emery phase even when two-body terms are repulsive. Furthermore, the
four-body coupling gives rise to a rich phase diagram and may lead to the
realization of the Haldane insulator phase at half-filling.

interface conditions for the pressure and velocity in the fluid that are
derived directly from the governing equations. The AMP scheme is stable even
for very light structures, requires no sub-iterations, and can be made fully
second-order, or higher-order, accurate. The new scheme is shown to be stable
through the analysis of a model problem. Exact traveling wave solutions for

  (HD4004) Through Spectropolarization","29 pages, 3 Figures, refereed journal paper",,"10.1088/0004-637X/777/1/9",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, high quality spectropolarimetric observations of the
Wolf-Rayet (WR) Star WR1 (HD4004) obtained with ESPaDOnS at CFHT are presented.
All major emission lines present in the spectrum show depolarization in the
relative Stokes parameters Q/I and U/I. From the behaviour of the amount of
line depolarization as a function of line strength, the intrinsic continuum
light polarization of WR1 is estimated to be P/I=0.443 \pm 0.028 % with an
angle of \theta=-26.2^o.
  Although such a level of polarization could in principle be caused by a wind
flattened by fast rotation, the scenario in which it is a consequence of the
presence in the wind of Corotating Interaction Regions (CIRs) is preferred.
This is supported by previous photometric and spectroscopic observations
showing periodic variations with a period of 16.9 days. This is now the third
WR star thought to exhibit CIRs in its wind that is found to have line
depolarization. Previous authors have found a strong correlation between line
depolarization and the presence of an ejected nebula, which they interpret as a
sign that the star has reached the WR phase relatively recently since the
nebula are thought to dissipate very fast. In the cases where the presence of
CIRs in the wind is favoured to explain the depolarization across spectral
lines, the above mentioned correlation may be indicating that those massive
stars have only very recently transited from the previous evolutionary phase to
the WR phase.

  Merav Parter and David Peleg","Generalized Perron--Frobenius Theorem for Nonsquare Matrices",,,,,"cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The celebrated Perron--Frobenius (PF) theorem is stated for irreducible
nonnegative square matrices, and provides a simple characterization of their
eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The importance of this theorem stems from the
fact that eigenvalue problems on such matrices arise in many fields of science
and engineering, including dynamical systems theory, economics, statistics and
optimization. However, many real-life scenarios give rise to nonsquare
matrices. A natural question is whether the PF Theorem (along with its
applications) can be generalized to a nonsquare setting. Our paper provides a
generalization of the PF Theorem to nonsquare matrices. The extension can be
interpreted as representing client-server systems with additional degrees of
freedom, where each client may choose between multiple servers that can
cooperate in serving it (while potentially interfering with other clients).
This formulation is motivated by applications to power control in wireless
networks, economics and others, all of which extend known examples for the use
of the original PF Theorem.
  We show that the option of cooperation between servers does not improve the
situation, in the sense that in the optimal solution no cooperation is needed,
and only one server needs to serve each client. Hence, the additional power of
having several potential servers per client translates into \emph{choosing} the
best single server and not into \emph{sharing} the load between the servers in
some way, as one might have expected.
  The two main contributions of the paper are (i) a generalized PF Theorem that
characterizes the optimal solution for a non-convex nonsquare problem, and (ii)
an algorithm for finding the optimal solution in polynomial time.

trajectories of a double-, three- and N-slit system on the basis of an emergent
sub-quantum theory developed by our group throughout the last years. The
quantum itself is considered as an emergent system representing an
off-equilibrium steady state oscillation maintained by a constant throughput of
energy provided by a classical zero-point energy field. We introduce the
concept of a ""relational causality"" which allows for evaluating structural
interdependences of different systems levels, i.e. in our case of the relations
between partial and total probability density currents, respectively. Combined
with the application of 21st century classical physics like, e.g., modern
nonequilibrium thermodynamics, we thus arrive at a ""superclassical"" theory.
Within this framework, the proposed current algebra directly leads to a new
formulation of the guiding equation which is equivalent to the original one of
the de Broglie-Bohm theory. By proving the absence of third order interferences
in three-path systems it is shown that Born's rule is a natural consequence of
our theory. Considering the series of one-, double-, or, generally, of N-slit
systems, with the first appearance of an interference term in the double slit
case, we can explain the violation of Sorkin's first order sum rule, just as
the validity of all higher order sum rules. Moreover, the Talbot patterns and
Talbot distance for an arbitrary N-slit device can be reproduced exactly by our
model without any quantum physics tool.

changes from convex to concave, which fixes the position of the maximum

decompose the irreducible vertex function into fully irreducible, charge and

  edition arXiv:1412.5995",,,,"q-bio.GN stat.AP stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Motivation: The mapping of RNA-seq reads to their transcripts of origin is a
fundamental task in transcript expression estimation and differential
expression scoring. Where ambiguities in mapping exist due to transcripts
sharing sequence, e.g. alternative isoforms or alleles, the problem becomes an
instance of non-trivial probabilistic inference. Bayesian inference in such a
problem is intractable and approximate methods must be used such as Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Variational Bayes. Standard implementations of
these methods can be prohibitively slow for large datasets and complex gene
models.
  Results: We propose an approximate inference scheme based on Variational
Bayes applied to an existing model of transcript expression inference from
RNA-seq data. We apply recent advances in Variational Bayes algorithmics to
improve the convergence of the algorithm beyond the standard variational
expectation-maximisation approach. We apply our algorithm to simulated and
biological datasets, demonstrating that the increase in speed requires only a
small trade-off in accuracy of expression level estimation.

logarithmically with the scale factor. In matter era the ratio of the quantum
to classical fluid settles eventually to a tiny constant, (rho_q) / (rho) =
10^(-13) for a grand unified scale inflation. Curiously, the late time scaling
of quantum fluctuations suggests that they contribute a little to the dark

and acts as a parent quantity for other relative entropies which have important

entropy and the min- and max-relative entropies. There is, however, another
relative entropy, called the 0-relative Renyi entropy, which plays a key role
in the analysis of various quantum information-processing tasks in the one-shot

quantum Renyi divergence only if $\rho$ and $\sigma$ have equal supports. This,
along with existing results in the literature, suggests that it suffices to
consider two essential parent quantities from which operationally relevant

identify the monopole part (centroid) of a 2-body interaction, as well as its

GHz power spectrum slope of 2.3+0.8-0.6 at 95% confidence. The light curve is
de-correlated (white noise) on very long (month to year) times. In order to
identify the transition time between red and white noise, we model the light
curves as a stochastic damped random walk process. The models allow a
quantitative estimate of this physical characteristic time-scale of 8-4+3 hours
at 230 GHz at 95% confidence, with consistent results at 345 and 690 GHz. This
corresponds to ~10 orbital times or ~1 inflow (viscous) time at R = 3 Rs, a
typical radius producing the 230 GHz emission as measured by very long baseline
interferometry and found in theoretical accretion flow and jet models. This
time-scale is significantly shorter (longer) than those measured at radio
(near-infrared, NIR) wavelengths, and is marginally inconsistent with the same
variability mechanism operating in the submm and NIR for the expected t ~ R^3/2
scaling. It is crudely consistent with the analogous time-scale inferred in
studies of quasar optical light curves after accounting for the difference in
emission radius. We find evidence that the submm variability persists at least
down to the ISCO, if not the event horizon. These results can be compared
quantitatively with similar analyses at different wavebands to test for
connections between the variability mechanisms, and with light curves from
theoretical models of accreting black holes.

outflows launched shortly after the AGB phase are thought to be the primary
shaping mechanism of bipolar and multipolar planetary nebulae (PNe). However,
little is known about the launching and driving mechanism for these jets, whose
momentum and energy often far exceed the energy that can be provided by
radiation pressure alone. Here, we report direct evidence of a magnetically
collimated jet shaping the bipolar morphology of the circumstellar envelope of
a post-AGB star. We present radio continuum observations of the post-AGB star
IRAS 15445-5449 which has water masers tracing a fast bipolar outflow. Our
observations confirm the earlier observed steep negative spectral index of the
spectral energy distribution (SED) above 3 GHz, and resolve, for the first
time, the emission to originate from a radio jet, proving the existence of such
jets around a post-AGB star. The SED is consistent with a synchrotron jet
embedded in a sheath of thermal electrons. We find a close correspondence
between the extent and direction of the synchrotron jet and the bipolar shape
of the object observed at other wavelenghts, suggesting that the jet is
responsible for the source morphology. The jet is collimated by a magnetic
field of the order of mG at almost 7000 AU from the central star. We recover
observations from the ATCA archive that indicate that the emission measure of
the thermal component has increased by a factor of three between 1998 and 2005
after which it has remained constant. The short timescale evolution of the
radio emission suggests a short lifetime for the jet.

evidence for significant outflows from these systems, most likely in the form
of accretion disk winds. These winds may represent the ""quasar"" mode of
feedback that is often invoked in galaxy formation/evolution models, and they
are also key to unification scenarios for active galactic nuclei (AGN) and
QSOs. To test these ideas, we construct a simple benchmark model of an
equatorial, biconical accretion disk wind in a QSO and use a Monte Carlo
ionization/radiative transfer code to calculate the ultraviolet spectra as a
function of viewing angle. We find that for plausible outflow parameters,
sightlines looking directly into the wind cone do produce broad, blue-shifted
absorption features in the transitions typically seen in broad absorption line
QSOs. However, our benchmark model is intrinsically X-ray weak in order to
prevent overionization of the outflow, and the wind does not yet produce
collisionally excited line emission at the level observed in non-BAL QSOs. As a
first step towards addressing these shortcomings, we discuss the sensitivity of
our results to changes in the assumed X-ray luminosity and mass-loss rate,
Mdot(wind). In the context of our adopted geometry, Mdot(wind) ~ Mdot(acc) is
required in order to produce significant BAL features. The kinetic luminosity

significant feedback.

red giant stars (RGBs) from Data Release 8 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey

to refine the measured distance and velocity to this tidal debris star stream
in the south Galactic cap. Assuming the tidal debris traces the progenitor's
orbit, we fit an orbit to the CPS and find that the stream is confined between
~24-36 kpc on a rather polar orbit inclined 87 degrees to the Galactic plane.
The eccentricity of the orbit is 0.20, and the period ~700 Myr. If we instead
matched N-body simulations to the observed tidal debris, these orbital
parameters would change by 10% or less. The CPS stars travel in the opposite
direction to those from the Sagittarius tidal stream in the same region of the
sky. Through N-body models of satellites on the best-fitting orbit, and
assuming that mass follows light, we show that the stream width, line-of-sight
depth, and velocity dispersion imply a progenitor of at least 10^8 solar
masses. However, the density of stars along the stream requires either a
disruption time on the order of one orbit, or a stellar population that is more
centrally concentrated than the dark matter. We suggest that an ultra-faint
dwarf galaxy progenitor could reproduce a large stream width and velocity
dispersion without requiring a very recent deflection of the progenitor into
its current orbit. We find that most Cetus stars have metallicities of -2.5 <
[Fe/H] < -2.0, similar to the observed metallicities of the ultra-faint dwarfs.
Our simulations suggest that the parameters of the dwarf galaxy progenitors,
including their dark matter content, could be constrained by observations of
their tidal tails through comparison of the debris with N-body simulations.

evidence for intense stellar mass loss during the final years leading up to
core collapse. We have argued that during and after core neon burning, internal
gravity waves excited by core convection can tap into the core fusion power and
transport a super-Eddington energy flux out to the stellar envelope,
potentially unbinding up to ~ 1 solar mass of material. In this work, we
explore the internal conditions of SN progenitors using the MESA 1-D stellar
evolution code, in search of those most susceptible to wave-driven mass loss.
We focus on simple, order of magnitude considerations applicable to a wide
range of progenitors. Wave-driven mass loss during core neon and oxygen fusion
happens preferentially in either lower mass (<~ 20 solar mass ZAMS) stars or
massive, sub-solar metallicity stars. Roughly 20 per cent of the SN progenitors
we survey can excite ~ 10^46 - 10^48 erg of energy in waves that can
potentially drive mass loss within a few months to a decade of core collapse.
This energy can generate a circumstellar environment with 10^-3 - 1 solar mass
reaching ~ 100 AU before explosion. We predict a correlation between the energy
associated with pre-SN mass ejection and the time to core collapse, with the
most intense mass loss preferentially happening closer to core collapse. During
silicon burning, a ~ 5 day long phase for our progenitor models, wave energy
may inflate ~ 10^-3 - 1 solar mass of the stellar envelope to ~ 10 - 100s of
solar radii. This suggests that some nominally compact SN progenitors (Type Ibc
progenitors) will have a significantly different SN shock breakout signature
than traditionally assumed. We discuss the implications of our results for the
core-collapse SN mechanism, Type IIn SNe, Type IIb SNe from extended
progenitors (e.g., SNe 1993j and 2011dh), and observed pre-SN outbursts.

suggest important contributions both from spin-orbit torques (SOTs) and from

for the DMI and show that within this Berry phase theory DMI and SOTs are
intimately related, in a way formally analogous to the relation between orbital
magnetization (OM) and anomalous Hall effect (AHE). We introduce the concept of
the \textit{twist torque moment}, which probes the internal twist of wave
packets in chiral magnets in a similar way like the orbital moment probes the
wave packet's internal self rotation. We propose to interpret the Berry phase
theory of DMI as a theory of \textit{spiralization} in analogy to the modern
theory of OM. We show that the twist torque moment and the spiralization
together give rise to a Berry phase governing the response of the SOT to
thermal gradients, in analogy to the intrinsic anomalous Nernst effect. The
Berry phase theory of DMI is computationally very efficient because it only
needs the electronic structure of the collinear magnetic system as input. As an
application of the formalism we compute the DMI in Pt/Co, Pt/Co/O and Pt/Co/Al

an infrared excess and forbidden emission lines in the optical. The object's
evolutionary status is uncertain and there are conflicting claims that it is
either a young stellar object or an evolved, interacting binary.
  Aims. To elucidate the reason for the B[e] behaviour of HD 85567, we have
observed it with the VLTI and AMBER.
  Methods. Our observations were conducted in the K-band with moderate spectral
resolution (R~1500, i.e. 200 km/s). The spectrum of HD 85567 exhibits Br gamma
and CO overtone bandhead emission. The interferometric data obtained consist of
spectrally dispersed visibilities, closure phases and differential phases
across these spectral features and the K-band continuum.
  Results. The closure phase observations do not reveal evidence of asymmetry.
The apparent size of HD 85567 in the K-band was determined by fitting the
visibilities with a ring model. The best fitting radius, 0.8 +/- 0.3 AU, is
relatively small making HD 85567 undersized in comparison to the
size-luminosity relationship based on YSOs of low and intermediate luminosity.
This has previously been found to be the case for luminous YSOs, and it has
been proposed that this is due to the presence of an optically thick gaseous
disc. We demonstrate that the differential phase observations over the CO
bandhead emission are indeed consistent with the presence of a compact (~1 AU)
gaseous disc interior to the dust sublimation radius.
  Conclusions. The observations reveal no sign of binarity. However, the data
do indicate the presence of a gaseous disc interior to the dust sublimation
radius. We conclude that the data are consistent with the hypothesis that HD
85567 is a YSO with an optically thick gaseous disc within a larger dust disc
that is being photo-evaporated from the outer edge.

neural network embracing a LDPC-like sparse encoding setup which makes it
extremely resilient to noise and errors. A natural use of GBNN is as an
associative memory. There are two activation rules for the neuron dynamics,
namely sum-of-sum and sum-of-max. The latter outperforms the former in terms of
retrieval rate by a huge margin. In prior discussions and experiments, it is
believed that although sum-of-sum may lead the network to oscillate, sum-of-max
always converges to an ensemble of neuron cliques corresponding to previously
stored patterns. However, this is not entirely correct. In fact, sum-of-max
often converges to bogus fixed points where the ensemble only comprises a small
subset of the converged state. By taking advantage of this overlooked fact, we
can greatly improve the retrieval rate. We discuss this particular issue and
propose a number of heuristics to push sum-of-max beyond these bogus fixed
points. To tackle the problem directly and completely, a novel post-processing
algorithm is also developed and customized to the structure of GBNN.
Experimental results show that the new algorithm achieves a huge performance
boost in terms of both retrieval rate and run-time, compared to the standard
sum-of-max and all the other heuristics.

Fluidity---hysteresivity normalized to the extremes of an elastic solid or a
viscous liquid---can be extracted from, and compared among, multiple
rheological measurements of cells: creep compliance vs. time, complex modulus
vs. frequency, and phase lag vs. frequency. With multiple strategies available
for acquisition of this nondimensional property, fluidity may serve as a useful
and robust parameter for distinguishing cell populations, and for understanding
the physical origins of deformability in soft matter. Here, for three disparate
eukaryotic cell types deformed in the suspended state via optical stretching,
we examine the dependence of fluidity on chemical and environmental influences
around a time scale of 1 s. We find that fluidity estimates are consistent in
the time and the frequency domains under a structural damping (power-law or
fractional derivative)model, but not under an equivalent-complexity
lumpedcomponent (spring-dashpot) model; the latter predicts spurious time
constants. Although fluidity is suppressed by chemical crosslinking, we find
that adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion in the cell does not measurably
alter the parameter, and thus conclude that active ATP-driven events are not a
crucial enabler of fluidity during linear viscoelastic deformation of a
suspended cell. Finally, by using the capacity of optical stretching to produce
near-instantaneous increases in cell temperature, we establish that fluidity
increases with temperature---now measured in a fully suspended, sortable cell
without the complicating factor of cell-substratum adhesion.

(RPCA) and maximal information coefficient (MIC), to study the redshift
dependence of halo baryonic properties. Our data are composed of a set of
different physical quantities for primordial minihaloes: dark-matter mass
($M_{\mathrm{dm}}$), gas mass ($M_{\mathrm{gas}}$), stellar mass
($M_{\mathrm{star}}$), molecular fraction (${\mathrm{x_{mol}}}$), metallicity
($Z$), star formation rate (SFR) and temperature. We find that
$M_{\mathrm{dm}}$ and $M_{\mathrm{gas}}$ are dominant factors for variance,
particularly at high redshift. Nonetheless, with the emergence of the first
stars and subsequent feedback mechanisms, ${\mathrm{x_{mol}}}$, SFR and $Z$
start to have a more dominant role. Standard PCA gives three principal
components (PCs) capable to explain more than 97 per cent of the data variance
at any redshift (two PCs usually accounting for no less than 92 per cent),
whilst the first PC from the RPCA analysis explains no less than 84 per cent of
the total variance in the entire redshift range (with two PCs explaining $
\gtrsim 95$ per cent anytime). Our analysis also suggests that all the gaseous
properties have a stronger correlation with $M_{\mathrm{gas}}$ than with
$M_{\mathrm{dm}}$, while $M_{\mathrm{gas}}$ has a deeper correlation with
${\mathrm{x_{mol}}}$ than with $Z$ or SFR. This indicates the crucial role of
gas molecular content to initiate star formation and consequent metal pollution
from Population III and Population II/I regimes in primordial galaxies.
Finally, a comparison between MIC and Spearman correlation coefficient shows
that the former is a more reliable indicator when halo properties are weakly
correlated.

half-light radii larger than expected from standard theoretical predictions

also found a very weak wavelength dependence of these half-light radii. We
consider disc temperature profile models that might match these observations.
Nixon and colleagues have suggested that misaligned accretion discs around
spinning black holes will be disrupted at radii small enough for the
Lense-Thirring torque to overcome the disc's viscous torque. Gas in precessing
annuli torn off a disc will spread radially and intersect with the remaining
disc, heating the disc at potentially large radii. However, if the intersection
occurs at an angle of more than a degree or so, highly supersonic collisions
will shock-heat the gas to a Compton temperature of T~10^7 K, and the spectral
energy distributions (SEDs) of discs with such shock-heated regions are poor
fits to observations of quasar SEDs. Torn discs where heating occurs in
intermittent weak shocks that occur whenever the intersection angle reaches a
tenth of a degree pose less of a conflict with observations, but do not have
significantly larger half-light radii than standard discs. We also study two
phenomenological disc temperature profile models. We find that discs with a
temperature spike at relatively large radii and lowered temperatures at radii
inside the spike yield improved and acceptable fits to microlensing sizes in
most cases. Such temperature profiles could in principle occur in sub-Keplerian
discs partially supported by magnetic pressure. However, such discs overpredict
the fluxes from quasars studied with microlensing except in the limit of
negligible continuum emission from radii inside the temperature spike.

provide a quantitative characterization of a complex biological variable that

this context is how to systematically identify the genomic variables that are
drivers of systematic variation captured by PCA. Principal components (and
other estimates of systematic variation) are directly constructed from the
genomic variables themselves, making measures of statistical significance
artificially inflated when using conventional methods due to over-fitting. We
introduce a new approach called the jackstraw that allows one to accurately
identify genomic variables that are statistically significantly associated with
any subset or linear combination of principal components (PCs). The proposed
method can greatly simplify complex significance testing problems encountered
in genomics and can be utilized to identify the genomic variables significantly
associated with latent variables. Using simulation, we demonstrate that our
method attains accurate measures of statistical significance over a range of
relevant scenarios. We consider yeast cell-cycle gene expression data, and show
that the proposed method can be used to straightforwardly identify
statistically significant genes that are cell-cycle regulated. We also analyze
gene expression data from post-trauma patients, allowing the gene expression
data to provide a molecularly-driven phenotype. We find a greater enrichment
for inflammatory-related gene sets compared to using a clinically defined
phenotype. The proposed method provides a useful bridge between large-scale

  We complement these results by considering the computational complexity of
determining small-support approximate equilibria. We show that random sampling
can be used to efficiently determine an approximate coarse correlated
equilibrium with logarithmic support. But, such a tight result does not hold
for correlated equilibrium, i.e., sampling might generate an approximate
correlated equilibrium of support size \Omega(m) where m is the number of
actions per player. Finally, we show that finding an exact correlated
equilibrium with smallest possible support is NP-hard under Cook reductions,
even in the case of two-player zero-sum games.

membrane-channel proteins expressed in diverse tissues. Recent papers showed
that during angiogenesis, AQP1 is expressed preferentially by microvessels,
favoring angiogenesis via the increase of permeability In particular, in AQP1
null mice, endothelial cell migration is impaired without altering their
proliferation or adhesion. Therefore, AQP1 has been proposed as a novel
promoter of tumor angiogenesis. Methods/Findings: Using targeted silencing of
AQP1 gene expression, an impairment in the organization of F-actin and a
reduced migration capacity was demonstrated in human endothelial and melanoma
cell lines. Interestingly, we showed, for the first time, that AQP1
co-immunoprecipitated with Lin-7. Lin7-GFP experiments confirmed
co-immunoprecipitation. In addition, the knock down of AQP1 decreased the level
of expression of Lin-7 and b-catenin and the inhibition of proteasome
contrasted partially such a decrease. Conclusions/Significance: All together,
our findings show that AQP1 plays a role inside the cells through
Lin-7/b-catenin interaction. Such a role of AQP1 is the same in human melanoma

melanoma cell lines, primary melanoma line IGR39 and its metastatic derivative

phenotypic evidence to support the origin of melanoma cancer stem cells (CSCs)

identification of a more aggressive subpopulation of CSCs in melanoma that are
CXCR6+. Conclusions/Significance: The association of a more aggressive tumor
phenotype with asymmetric self-renewal phenotype reveals a previously
unrecognized aspect of tumor cell physiology. Namely, the retention of some
tissue-specific stem cell attributes, like the ability to asymmetrically
self-renew, impacts the natural history of human tumor development. Knowledge
of this new aspect of tumor development and progression may provide new targets

to CP violation explicitly is demonstrated. The derivation starts from a most
general $3 \times 3$ mass matrix $M$ containing eighteen parameters, which
applies to all fermion types, and then reduces the number of parameters down to
five with a Hermitian condition modified in this manuscript between the real
part and imaginary part of $M$. All matrix pairs thus derived will be
diagonalized simultaneously by a same $U$ matrix which means FCNCs won't appear
at tree-level anymore. Subsequently, an assumption of $A=A_1=A_2=A_3$ is
imposed and four special solutions are thus found which reveal $S_3$ and $S_2$
symmetries among fermion generations respectively. Consequently, as a
by-product of solving the FCNC problem, complex CKM matrices appear if the
symmetries were assigned to up- and down-type quarks suitably. Unfortunately,
CKM elements thus derived are very different to the experimentally detected
values. The CP strength of this model, estimated by the Jarlskog invariant, is
four orders higher than the one predicted by the standard model. This
difference is in fact reasonable since we don't see any such symmetries in our
present universe. However, if they had appeared in some early stages of our
universe, such a strong CP strength may provide a way to account for at least
part of the discrepancy between the observed BAU and that predicted by the
standard model.

In this formalism the entropic index q is a quantity characterizing the degree
of nonextensivity, and is interpreted as a parameter of long-memory or
long-range interactions between the components of the system. Since its
proposition in 1988, this formalism has been applied to investigate a wide
variety of natural phenomena. In stellar astrophysics, theoretical distribution
function based on nonextensive formalism (q-distributions) has been
successfully applied to reproduce the distribution of stellar radial and
rotational velocity data. In this paper, we investigate the time variation of
the entropic index q obtained from the distribution of rotation, Vsini, for a
sample of 254 rotational data for solar-type stars from 11 open clusters aged
between 35.5Myr and 2.6Gyr. As a result, we have found an anti-correlation
between the entropic index q and the age of clusters, and that the distribution
of rotation Vsini for these stars becomes extensive for an age greater than
about 170Myr. Assuming that the parameter q is associated with long-memory
effects, we suggest that the memory of the initial angular momentum of
solar-type stars can be scaled by the entropic index q. We also propose a
physical link between the parameter q and the magnetic braking of stellar
rotation.

accelerating cosmology: a flat universe with matter and a cosmological constant
($\Lambda$). Hubble series expansions are fit to the SCP Union2.1 supernova
data set to estimate the Hubble Constant ($H_{0}$), the deceleration parameter
($q_{0}$), and the jerk parameter ($j_{0}$). Flat $\Lambda$CDM models always
require $j_{0} = 1$, providing a single-parameter test of the entire paradigm.
Because of convergence issues for $z \gtrsim 1$, we focus on expansions using
the newer redshift variable $y$, and to estimate the effects of ""model-building
uncertainties"" -- the dependence of the output results upon the fitting
function and parameters used -- we perform fits using five different distance
indicator functions, and four different polynomial orders. We find that one
cannot yet use the supernova data to reliably obtain more than four
cosmological parameters, and that cosmographic estimates of $j_{0}$ remain
dominated by model-building uncertainties, in conjunction with statistical and
other error sources. While $j_{0} = 1$ remains consistent with Union2.1, the
most restrictive bound that we can place is $j_{0} \sim [-7.6,8.5]$. To test
the future prospects of cosmography with new standard candle data, ensembles of
mock supernova data sets are created, and it is found that the best way to
reduce model-building uncertainties on lower-order Hubble parameters (such as
$\{H_{0}, q_{0}, j_{0} \}$) is by limiting the redshift range of the data. Thus
more and better $z \lesssim 1$ data, not higher-redshift data, is needed to
sharpen cosmographic tests of flat $\Lambda$CDM.

Results are derived on subsystem truncation of such systems and it is shown
that this truncation preserves the physical realizability property of linear
quantum stochastic systems. It is also shown that the property of complete
passivity of linear quantum stochastic systems is preserved under subsystem
truncation. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a
balanced realization of a linear quantum stochastic system under sympletic

and will not be satisfied by generic linear quantum stochastic systems, thus
necessary and sufficient conditions for relaxed notions of simultaneous
diagonalization of the controllability and observability Gramians of linear
quantum stochastic systems under symplectic transformations are also obtained.
The notion of a quasi-balanced realization is introduced and it is shown that
all asymptotically stable completely passive linear quantum stochastic systems
have a quasi-balanced realization. Moreover, an explicit bound for the
subsystem truncation error on a quasi-balanceable linear quantum stochastic

from Planck to constrain the string tension, G\mu, and the reconnection
probability, P. In demonstrating the parameter constraints with Planck curl
mode, we also measure the lensing power spectrum from the Atacama Cosmology
Telescope (ACT) 2008 season data, which have better angular resolution with
lower instrumental noise on a much smaller chunk of the sky. Assuming P=1, the
upper bound on tension is G\mu = 6.6\times 10^{-5} with 2\sigma (95% C.L.),
using curl mode from Planck, which is weaker than that from the small-scale
temperature power spectrum. For small values of P, however, the constraint from
curl mode becomes tighter compared to that from temperature power spectrum. For
P\lsim 10^{-2}, we obtain the constraint on the combination of the string
parameters as G\mu P^{-1}\leq 3.4\times 10^{-5} at more than 2\sigma (95%
C.L.).

From the WL surveys, we take into account both the shear and clustering of the

CMB prior is included in all cases. Focusing on the large-scale, two-point
function information, we find strong synergy between the two probes. The dark
energy figure of merit from WL+GC is up to a factor ~2.5 larger than from
either probe alone. Considering modified gravity, if the growth factor f(z) is
treated as a free function, it is very poorly constrained by WL or GC alone,
but can be measured at the few percent level by the combination of the two. On
the other hand, for cosmological constraints derived from (angular) power
spectra and considering statistical errors only, it hardly matters whether the
surveys overlap on the sky or not. For instance, the dark energy figure of
merit for overlapping surveys is at most ~20 % better than in the disjoint
case. This modest gain can be traced to the fundamental fact that only a small
fraction of the total number of modes sampled by the GC survey (or by the WL
survey) contributes to the cross-correlations between WL and GC.

networks, which does not require global knowledge on the embedding of the
nodes, instead it exploits link-wise information (link lengths, link delays or
other physical quantities). Our method can be regarded as a generalization of
the spectral dimension, that grasps the network's large-scale structure through
local observations made by a random walker while traversing the links. We apply
the presented method to synthetic and real-world networks, including road maps,
the Internet infrastructure and the Gowalla geosocial network. We analyze the
theoretically and empirically designated case when the length distribution of
the links has the form P(r) ~ 1/r. We show that while previous dimension
concepts are not applicable in this case, the new dimension measure still
exhibits scaling with two distinct scaling regimes. Our observations suggest
that the link length distribution is not sufficient in itself to entirely
control the dimensionality of complex networks, and we show that the proposed
measure provides information that complements other known measures.

of developing data analysis strategies for searching their possible counterpart
signals in the data of gravitational wave (GW) detectors in the advanced
detector era. This is especially attractive since short hard gamma-ray bursts
(SGRBs) may have compact binary coalescences involving neutron stars (CBCNSs)
as their progenitors, which emit gravitational waves. Joint electromagnetic
(EM) and GW observations of these objects will enrich our understanding of
their beaming, energetics, galactic environment, and shed light on a host of
other outstanding questions related to them. Here we recognize some of the
astrophysical factors that determine what fraction of CBCNS sources can
generate orphaned afterglows. Pipelines already exist that target the
sky-position and time of occurrence of SGRBs, known from EM observations, to
search for their counterparts in GW detector data. Modifying them to analyze
extended periods of time in the GW data in the past of the afterglow detection,
while targeting a single sky-position, can search for GWs from the common
progenitor. We assess the improvement in GW detectability to be had from
utilizing the sky-position information. We also propose a method for improving
the detection efficiency of targeted searches of GW signals from the putative
CBCNS sources of afterglows and short gamma ray bursts in the presence of
errors in detector calibration or CBCNS waveform models used in the search. The
improvement arises from searching in a wider patch of the sky even when the
sky-position is known accurately from EM observations and utilizes the
covariance of the errors in waveform parameters with those in the sky position.

objective is for the agents to recover $x$ from their collective measurements
using only communication with neighbors in the network. Our distributed
approach to this problem is based on the centralized Iterative Hard
Thresholding algorithm (IHT). We first present a distributed IHT algorithm for
static networks that leverages standard tools from distributed computing to
execute in-network computations with minimized bandwidth consumption. Next, we
address distributed signal recovery in networks with time-varying topologies.
The network dynamics necessarily introduce inaccuracies to our in-network
computations. To accommodate these inaccuracies, we show how centralized IHT
can be extended to include inexact computations while still providing the same
recovery guarantees as the original IHT algorithm. We then leverage these new
theoretical results to develop a distributed version of IHT for time-varying
networks. Evaluations show that our distributed algorithms for both static and

the systematic errors on measurements of the structure growth-rate parameter,
$f\sigma_8$, induced by non-linear effects and the halo bias with respect to
the dark matter distribution, by using halo catalogues from 40 realisations of
$3.4 \times 10^8$ comoving $h^{-3}$Mpc$^3$ cosmological N-body simulations. We
consider hypothetical redshift surveys at redshifts z=0.5, 1.35 and 2, and
different minimum halo mass thresholds in the range of $5.0 \times 10^{11}$ --
$2.0 \times 10^{13} h^{-1} M_\odot$. We find that the systematic error of
$f\sigma_8$ is greatly reduced to ~5 per cent level, when a recently proposed
analytical formula of RSD that takes into account the higher-order coupling
between the density and velocity fields is adopted, with a scale-dependent
parametric bias model. Dependence of the systematic error on the halo mass, the
redshift, and the maximum wavenumber used in the analysis is discussed. We also
find that the Wilson-Hilferty transformation is useful to improve the accuracy
of likelihood analysis when only a small number of modes are available in power

evolutionary population synthesis (EPS) models of galaxies, one particular
aspect is puzzling: TP-AGB models aimed at reproducing the lifetimes and
integrated fluxes of the TP-AGB phase in Magellanic Cloud (MC) clusters, when
incorporated into EPS models, are found to overestimate the TP-AGB contribution
in resolved star counts and integrated spectra of galaxies. In this paper, we
call attention to a particular evolutionary aspect that in all probability is
the main cause of this conundrum. As soon as stellar populations intercept the
ages at which RGB stars first appear, a sudden change in the lifetime of the
core He-burning phase causes a temporary boost in the production rate of
subsequent evolutionary phases, including the TP-AGB. For a timespan of about
0.1 Gyr, triple TP-AGB branches develop at slightly different initial masses,
causing their frequency and contribution to the integrated luminosity of the
stellar population to increase by a factor of 2. The boost occurs just in the
proximity of the expected peak in the TP-AGB lifetimes, and for ages of 1.6
Gyr. Coincidently, this relatively narrow age interval happens to contain the
few very massive MC clusters that host most of the TP-AGB stars used to
constrain stellar evolution and EPS models. This concomitance makes the
AGB-boosting particularly insidious in the context of present EPS models. The
effect brings about three main consequences. (1) Present estimates of the
TP-AGB contribution to the integrated light of galaxies derived from MC
clusters, are biased towards too large values. (2) The relative TP-AGB
contribution of single-burst populations falling in this critical age range
cannot be accurately derived by the fuel consumption theorem. (3) A careful
revision of AGB star populations in intermediate-age MC clusters is urgently
demanded.

the collapse of a massive star, and it has been suggested that its ambient
medium is a homogenous interstellar medium (ISM) or a stellar wind. There are
two shocks when an ultra-relativistic fireball that has been ejected during the
prompt gamma-ray emission phase sweeps up the circumburst medium: a reverse
shock that propagates into the fireball, and a forward shock that propagates
into the ambient medium. In this paper, we investigate the temporal evolution
of the dynamics and emission of these two shocks in an environment with a
general density distribution of $n\propto R^{-k}$ (where $R$ is the radius) by
considering thick-shell and thin-shell cases. A GRB afterglow with one smooth
onset peak at early times is understood to result from such external shocks.
Thus, we can determine the medium density distribution by fitting the onset
peak appearing in the light curve of an early optical afterglow. We apply our
model to 19 GRBs, and find that their $k$ values are in the range of 0.4 - 1.4,
with a typical value of $k\sim1$, implying that this environment is neither a
homogenous interstellar medium with $k=0$ nor a typical stellar wind with
$k=2$. This shows that the progenitors of these GRBs might have undergone a new
mass-loss evolution.

Within the model the two-component fermionic particles are able to hop in the
lattice, while the one-component fermionic particles are localized. The model
is studied by using the dynamical mean-field theory with exact diagonalization.
Its homogeneous solutions establish Mott transitions for both commensurate and
incommensurate fillings between one third and two thirds. At commensurate one
third and two thirds fillings the Mott transition occurs for any density of

occur only for density one half of hopping particles. At half filling,
depending on the repulsive interactions the reentrant effect of the Mott
insulator is observed. As increasing local interaction of hopping particles,
the first insulator-metal transition is continuous, whereas the second

transition crosses a finite region where both metallic and insulating phase
coexist. At third filling the Mott transition is established only for strong

molecular clouds in the giant molecular cloud complex W43. It has previously
been identified as one of the most massive star-forming regions in our Galaxy.
To trace the moderately dense molecular clouds in the W43 region, we initiated
an IRAM 30m large program, named W43-HERO, covering a large dynamic range of
scales (from 0.3 to 140 pc). We obtained on-the-fly-maps in 13CO (2-1) and C18O
(2-1) with a high spectral resolution of 0.1 km/s and a spatial resolution of
12"". These maps cover an area of ~1.5 square degrees and include the two main
clouds of W43, as well as the lower density gas surrounding them. A comparison
with Galactic models and previous distance calculations confirms the location
of W43 near the tangential point of the Scutum arm at a distance from the Sun
of approximately 6 kpc. The resulting intensity cubes of the observed region
are separated into sub-cubes, centered on single clouds which are then analyzed
in detail. The optical depth, excitation temperature, and H2 column density
maps are derived out of the 13CO and C18O data. These results are then compared
with those derived from Herschel dust maps. The mass of a typical cloud is
several 10^4 solar masses while the total mass in the dense molecular gas (>100
cm^-3) in W43 is found to be about 1.9e6 solar masses. Probability distribution
functions obtained from column density maps derived from molecular line data
and Herschel imaging show a log-normal distribution for low column densities
and a power-law tail for high densities. A flatter slope for the molecular line
data PDF may imply that those selectively show the gravitationally collapsing
gas.

decomposed into a narrow Drude (coherent) component and an incoherent

pnictides in their highly incoherent charge dynamics or bad metallic behavior
with the coherent Drude component occupying a tiny fraction of the low-energy
spectral weight. The fraction of the coherent spectral weight or the degree of
coherence is shown to be well correlated with the TM-pnictogen bond angle and
the electron filling of TM 3d orbitals, which are measures of the strength of
electronic correlations. The iron arsenides are thus strongly correlated
systems, and the doping into BaFe2As2 controls the strength of electronic
correlations. This naturally explains a remarkable asymmetry in the charge
dynamics of electron- and hole-doped systems, and the unconventional
superconductivity appears to emerge when the correlations are fairly strong.

promising candidates for the carriers of the diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs).
The PAH-DIB hypothesis, however, raises two major issues. First, the number of
interstellar PAH species is potentially orders of magnitude larger than the
number of DIBs. Second, the absorption spectrum of a PAH is in general
dominated by bands found at UV wavelengths while, conversely, DIBs are absent
from the UV wavelength domain and arise at visible and near IR wavelengths.
These issues do not necessarily weaken the PAH-DIB hypothesis and can actually
allow us to refine it. In that context, we analyze the UV/vis absorption
spectra of PAH molecules isolated in Ne matrices and propose that
polyynyl-substituted PAHs, or similar species, are valid candidates for the
carriers of the DIBs. Finally, a possible lifecycle for DIB-carrying PAHs is
presented.

proving that the fundamental theorem of calculus breaks down in the context of
any non-locally convex quasi-Banach space. Our approach introduces the tool of
Riemann-integral averages of continuous functions, and uses it to bring out to

unitary transformation can be executed using the available controls. In
practice, control fields are a source of unavoidable noise, which has to be
suppressed to retain controllability. Can one design control fields such that
the effect of noise is negligible on the time-scale of the transformation? This
question is intimately related to the fundamental problem of a connection
between the computational complexity of the control problem and the sensitivity
of the controlled system to noise. The present study considers a paradigm of
control, where the Lie-algebraic structure of the control Hamiltonian is fixed,
while the size of the system increases with the dimension of the Hilbert space
representation of the algebra. We find two types of control tasks, easy and
hard. Easy tasks are characterized by a small variance of the evolving state
with respect to the operators of the control operators. They are relatively
immune to noise and the control field is easy to find. Hard tasks have a large
variance, are sensitive to noise and the control field is hard to find. The
influence of noise increases with the size of the system, which is measured by
the scaling factor $N$ of the largest weight of the representation. For fixed
time and control field as O(N) for easy tasks and as $O(N^2)$ for hard tasks.
As a consequence, even in the most favorable estimate, for large quantum
systems, generic noise in the controls dominates for a typical class of target
transformations, i.e., complete controllability is destroyed by noise.

is argued based on their optical features (e.g. disks, spiral arms, bars) and
kinematic properties similar to late-type galaxies. After their infall,
environmental effects gradually transform them into early-type galaxies through
the removal of their interstellar medium and quenching of all star formation
activity. In this paper, we aim to verify whether this hypothesis holds using
far-infrared diagnostics based on Herschel observations of the Virgo cluster
taken as part of the Herschel Virgo Cluster Survey (HeViCS). We select
transition-type objects in the nearest cluster, Virgo, based on spectral
diagnostics indicative for their residual or ongoing star formation. We detect
dust Md ~ 10^{5-6} Msun in 36% of the transition-type dwarfs located on the
high end of the stellar mass distribution. This suggests that the dust
reservoirs present in non-detections fall just below the Herschel detection
limit (< 1.1x10^5 Msun). Dust scaling relations support the hypothesis of a
transformation between infalling late-type galaxies to quiescent low-mass
spheroids governed by environmental effects, with dust-to-stellar mass
fractions for transition-type dwarfs in between values characteristic for
late-type objects and the lower dust fractions observed in early-type galaxies.
Several transition-type dwarfs demonstrate blue central cores, hinting at the
radially outside-in removal of gas and quenching of star formation activity.

problem complexity by using a closure of the graph. This closure is a
supergraph of G which preserves Hamiltonicity, that is, which is Hamiltonian if
and only if G is. Since this seminal work, several closure concepts preserving
Hamiltonicity were introduced. In particular Ryjacek defined in 1997 a closure
concept for claw-free graphs based on local completion. The completion is
performed for every eligible vertex of the graph.
  Extending these works, Vallee and Bretto recently introduced a new closure
concept preserving Hamiltonicity and based on local completion. The local
completion is performed for each neighborhood-equivalence eligible vertex of
the graph.

with NIR photometry from the Spitzer Space Telescope it is possible to measure
the rest-frame UV-optical colours of galaxies at z=4-8. The UV-optical spectral
energy distribution of star formation dominated galaxies is the result of
several different factors. These include the joint distribution of stellar
masses, ages, and metallicities, and the subsequent reprocessing by dust and
gas in the ISM. Using a large cosmological hydrodynamical simulation we
investigate the predicted spectral energy distributions of galaxies at
high-redshift with a particular emphasis on assessing the potential
contribution of nebular emission. We find that the average pure stellar
UV-optical colour correlates with both luminosity and redshift such that
galaxies at lower-redshift and higher-luminosity are typically redder. Assuming
the escape fraction of ionising photons is close to zero, the effect of nebular
emission is to redden the UV-optical 1500-V_w colour by, on average, 0.4 mag at
z=8 declining to 0.25 mag at z=4. Young and low-metallicity stellar
populations, which typically have bluer pure stellar UV-optical colours,
produce larger ionising luminosities and are thus more strongly affected by the
reddening effects of nebular emission. This causes the distribution of 1500-V_w
colours to narrow and the trends with luminosity and redshift to weaken. The
strong effect of nebular emission leaves observed-frame colours critically
sensitive to the source redshift. For example, increasing the redshift by 0.1
can result in observed frame colours changing by up to ~0.6. These predictions
reinforce the need to include nebular emission when modelling the spectral
energy distributions of galaxies at high-redshift and also highlight the
difficultly in interpreting the observed colours of individual galaxies without

resonant interaction between the impurity and the host in the case of equal

(MFCCA) - that constitutes a consistent extension of the Detrended
Cross-Correlation Analysis (DCCA) and is able to properly identify and quantify
subtle characteristics of multifractal cross-correlations between two time
series. Our motivation for introducing this algorithm is that the already
existing methods like MF-DXA have at best serious limitations for most of the
signals describing complex natural processes and often indicate multifractal
cross-correlations when there are none. The principal component of the present
extension is proper incorporation of the sign of fluctuations to their
generalized moments. Furthermore, we present a broad analysis of the model
fractal stochastic processes as well as of the real-world signals and show that
MFCCA is a robust and selective tool at the same time, and therefore allows for
a reliable quantification of the cross-correlative structure of analyzed
processes. In particular, it allows one to identify the boundaries of the
multifractal scaling and to analyze a relation between the generalized Hurst
exponent and the multifractal scaling parameter $\lambda_q$. This relation
provides information about character of potential multifractality in
cross-correlations and thus enables a deeper insight into dynamics of the
analyzed processes than allowed by any other related method available so far.
By using examples of time series from stock market, we show that financial
fluctuations typically cross-correlate multifractally only for relatively large
fluctuations, whereas small fluctuations remain mutually independent even at
maximum of such cross-correlations. Finally, we indicate possible utility of
MFCCA to study effects of the time-lagged cross-correlations.

emerge from continuous spectra in a class of infinite-dimensional noncanonical

the continuum Hamiltonian Hopf (CHH) bifurcation, which is an
infinite-dimensional analog of the usual Hamiltonian Hopf (HH) bifurcation.
Necessary notions pertaining to spectra, structural stability, signature of the
continuous spectra, and normal forms are described. The theory developed is
applicable to a wide class of 2+1 noncanonical Hamiltonian matter models, but
the specific example of the Vlasov-Poisson system linearized about homogeneous
(spatially independent) equilibria is treated in detail. For this example,
structural (in)stability is established in an appropriate functional analytic
setting, and two kinds of bifurcations are considered, one at infinite and one
at finite wavenumber. After defining and describing the notion of dynamical
accessibility, Kre\u{i}n-like theorems regarding signature and bifurcation are
proven. In addition, a canonical Hamiltonian example, composed of a negative
energy oscillator coupled to a heat bath, is treated and our development is
compared to pervious work in this context. A careful counting of eigenvalues,
with and without symmetry, is undertaken, leading to the definition of a
degenerate continuum steady state (CSS) bifurcation. It is described how the
CHH and CSS bifurcations can be viewed as linear normal forms associated with
the nonlinear single-wave model described in [BAL13], which is a companion to

one and three shape properties, typically associated with F- and G-flexion, are

telescope's PSF, in addition to the lensing properties. The same is true for
shear. In this work we create a completely analytic mapping from apparent
measured galaxy flexions to gravitational flexions by (1) creating simple
models for a lensed galaxy and for a PSF whose distortions are dominated by
atmospheric smearing and optical aberrations, (2) convolving the two models,
and (3) comparing the pre- and post-convolved flexion-like shape variations of
the final image. For completeness, we do the same for shear. As expected,
telescope astigmatism, coma, and trefoil can corrupt measurements of shear, F-
flexion, and G-flexion, especially for small galaxies. We additionally find
that PSF size dilutes the flexion signal more rapidly than the shear signal.
Moreover, mixing between shears, flexions, and asymmetric aberrations can
create additive offsets in lensing measurements that vary with both galaxy size
and galaxy ellipticity and flexion values. But all is not lost; by measuring
the patterns, we can correct for them.

the light-curve of the source combined with VLBI data. The conclusions derived
have been confirmed by numerical simulations combined with emission
calculations that have allowed to study the spectral evolution of the perturbed
jet. Helical structures can also be identified in radio-jets. The ridge-line of
emission of the jet of S5~0836+710 has been identified as a physical structure
corresponding to a wave developing in the jet flow. I review here the evidence
that has allowed to reach this conclusion, along with an associated caveat.
Current data do not allow to distinguish between magnetic or hydrodynamical
instabilities. I finally discuss the importance of these linear and non-linear
waves for jet evolution.

By work of Chataur and Menichi, the homology of
the space of free loops in the classifying space of G is known to be the value
on the circle in a homological conformal field theory. This means in particular
that it admits operations parameterized by homology classes of classifying
spaces of diffeomorphism groups of surfaces. Here we present a radical
extension of this result, giving a new construction in which diffeomorphisms
are replaced with homotopy equivalences, and surfaces with boundary are
replaced with arbitrary spaces homotopy equivalent to finite graphs. The result
is a novel kind of field theory which is related to both the diffeomorphism
groups of surfaces and the automorphism groups of free groups with boundaries.
Our work shows that the algebraic structures in string topology of classifying
spaces can be brought into line with, and in fact far exceed, those available
in string topology of manifolds. For simplicity, we restrict to the
characteristic 2 case. The generalization to arbitrary characteristic will be
addressed in a subsequent paper.

around 125 GeV and with measured properties compatible with those of a
Standard-Model Higgs boson, coupled with the absence of discoveries of
phenomena beyond the Standard Model at the TeV scale, has triggered interest in
ideas for future Higgs factories. A new circular e+e- collider hosted in a 80
to 100 km tunnel, TLEP, is among the most attractive solutions proposed so far.
It has a clean experimental environment, produces high luminosity for
top-quark, Higgs boson, W and Z studies, accommodates multiple detectors, and
can reach energies up to the t-tbar threshold and beyond. It will enable
measurements of the Higgs boson properties and of Electroweak Symmetry-Breaking
(EWSB) parameters with unequalled precision, offering exploration of physics
beyond the Standard Model in the multi-TeV range. Moreover, being the natural
precursor of the VHE-LHC, a 100 TeV hadron machine in the same tunnel, it
builds up a long-term vision for particle physics. Altogether, the combination
of TLEP and the VHE-LHC offers, for a great cost effectiveness, the best
precision and the best search reach of all options presently on the market.
This paper presents a first appraisal of the salient features of the TLEP
physics potential, to serve as a baseline for a more extensive design study.

continuous domains, maximum likelihood is usually used to assess the
predictions of those classifiers. When data is scarce, this can easily lead to
overfitting. In any probabilistic setting, Bayesian averaging (BA) provides
theoretically optimal predictions and is known to be robust to overfitting. In
this work we introduce Bayesian Conditional Gaussian Network Classifiers, which
efficiently perform exact Bayesian averaging over the parameters. We evaluate
the proposed classifiers against the maximum likelihood alternatives proposed
so far over standard UCI datasets, concluding that performing BA improves the
quality of the assessed probabilities (conditional log likelihood) whilst
maintaining the error rate.
  Overfitting is more likely to occur in domains where the number of data items
is small and the number of variables is large. These two conditions are met in
the realm of bioinformatics, where the early diagnosis of cancer from mass
spectra is a relevant task. We provide an application of our classification
framework to that problem, comparing it with the standard maximum likelihood
alternative, where the improvement of quality in the assessed probabilities is
confirmed.

Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO) are analyzed with the goal of providing
a general tool to interpret the role of the magnetic field in molecular clouds.
Magnetic field and dust emission gradient orientations are observed to show
distinct patterns and features. The angle $\delta$ between these two
orientations can be interpreted as a magnetic field alignment deviation,
assuming the emission gradient orientation to coincide with the density
gradient orientation in the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) force equation. In SMA
high-resolution (collapsing) cores, additional symmetry properties in $\delta$
can reveal accretion and outflow zones. All these observational findings
suggest the angle $\delta$ to be a relevant quantity that can assess the role
of the magnetic field. Indeed, when comparing this angle with the
(projection-free) magnetic field significance \Sigma_B (Koch et al. 2012a), it
is demonstrated that |\delta| yields an approximation to the change in
\Sigma_B. Thus, changes in the magnetic field alignment deviation $\delta$
trace changes in the role of the magnetic field. The angle $\delta$ is
observationally straightforward to determine, providing a tool to distinguish
between zones of minor or significant magnetic field impact. This is
exemplified by the CSO M+0.25+0.01, Mon R2, CO+0.02-0.02, M-0.02-0.07 sources
and by the SMA high-resolution data from W51 e2, W51 North, Orion BN/KL and
g5.89. Additional CSO sources are analyzed, providing further support of this
result. Finally, based on the different features found in our sample of 31
sources in total, covering sizes from large-scale complexes to collapsing
cores, a schematic evolutionary scenario is proposed (abridged).

elastic scattering amplitude receives contributions from both the inelastic and
the elastic channels. We explore this unitarity condition in order to describe,
in a connected way, hadron-hadron observables like the total and elastic
differential cross sections, the ratio of the real to imaginary part of the
forward scattering amplitude and the inclusive multiplicity distributions in
full phase space, over a large range of energies. We introduce non-perturbative
QCD effects in the forward scattering amplitude by using the infrared QCD
effective charge dependent on the dynamical gluon mass. In our analysis we pay
special attention to the theoretical uncertainties in the predictions due to
this mass scale variation. We also present quantitative predictions for the
$H_{q}$ moments at high energies. Our results reproduce the moment oscillations
observed in experimental data, and are consistent with the behavior predicted
by QCD.

By
means of a four-tip STM/SEM the local structure of graphene grown on SiC(0001)
was correlated with scanning electron microscope images and spatially resolved
transport measurements. The systematic variation of probe spacings and
substrate temperature has clearly revealed two-dimensional transport regimes of
Anderson localization as well as of diffusive transport. The detailed analysis
of the temperature dependent data demonstrates that the local on-top nano-sized
contacts do not induce significant strain to the epitaxial graphene films.

However, the size of those networks has grown tremendously with the increase of
computational power and data storage. While various methods have been developed
to extract community structures, their computational cost or the difficulty to
parallelize existing algorithms make partitioning real networks into
communities a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose to alter an
efficient algorithm, the Louvain method, such that communities are defined as
the connected components of a tree-like assignment graph. Within this
framework, we precisely describe the different steps of our algorithm and
demonstrate its highly parallelizable nature. We then show that despite its
simplicity, our algorithm has a partitioning quality similar to the original
method on benchmark graphs and even outperforms other algorithms. We also show
that, even on a single processor, our method is much faster and allows the
analysis of very large networks.

information from databases. So, there is a need to prevent the inference rules
from being disclosed such that the more secure data sets cannot be identified
from non sensitive attributes. This can be done through removing or adding
certain item sets in the transactions Sanitization. The purpose is to hide the
Inference rules, so that the user may not be able to discover any valuable
information from other non sensitive data and any organisation can release all
samples of their data without the fear of Knowledge Discovery In Databases
which can be achieved by investigating frequently occurring item sets, rules
that can be mined from them with the objective of hiding them. Another way is
to release only limited samples in the new database so that there is no
information loss and it also satisfies the legitimate needs of the users. The
major problem is uncovering hidden patterns, which causes a threat to the
database security. Sensitive data are inferred from non-sensitive data based on
the semantics of the application the user has, commonly known as the inference
problem. Two fundamental approaches to protect sensitive rules from disclosure
are that, preventing rules from being generated by hiding the frequent sets of
data items and reducing the importance of the rules by setting their confidence
below a user-specified threshold.

Computing Intrusion Detection System detects encrypted node communication and
find the hidden attack trial which inspects and detects those attacks that
network based and host based cant identify. It incorporates Knowledge and
behavior analysis to identify specific intrusions. Signature based IDS monitor
the packets in the network and identifies those threats by matching with
database but It fails to detect those attacks that are not included in
database. Signature based IDS will perform poor capturing in large volume of
anomalies. Another problem is that Cloud Service Provider hides the attack that
is caused by intruder, due to distributed nature cloud environment has high
possibility for vulnerable resources. By impersonating legitimate users, the
intruders can use a services abundant resources maliciously. In Proposed System
we combine few concepts which are available with new intrusion detection
techniques. Here to merge Entropy based System with Anomaly detection System
for providing multilevel Distributed Denial of Service. This is done in two
steps: First, Users are allowed to pass through router in network site in that
it incorporates Detection Algorithm and detects for legitimate user. Second,
again it pass through router placed in cloud site in that it incorporates
confirmation Algorithm and checks for threshold value, if its beyond the
threshold value it considered as legitimate user, else its an intruder found in

ideal string is presented. Unlike previous studies, assumptions such as
constant tension, inextensibility, constant crosssectional area, small
deformations and slopes are all removed. The main result is that, despite such
relaxations in the model, not only does the final equation remain linear, but,
it is exactly the same equation obtained in classical treatments. First, an
""infinitesimals"" based analysis, similar to historical methods, is given.
However, an alternative and much stronger approach, solely based on finite
quantities, is also presented. Furthermore, it is shown that the same result
can also be obtained by Lagrangian mechanics, which indicates the compatibility
of the original method with those based on energy and variational principles.
Another interesting result is the relation between the force distribution and
string displacement in static cases, which states that the force distribution
per length is proportional to the second spatial derivative of the
displacement. Finally, an equation of motion pertaining to variable initial
density and area is presented.

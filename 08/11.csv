introduced to study the symmetries and the structure of the fields. This kind
of Noether symmetry is a subclass of a more general family of symmetries,
called Noether Gauge Symmetries (NGS). Motivated by this mathematical tool, in
this article, we discuss the generalized Noether symmetry of Quintom model of
dark energy, which is a two component fluid model of quintessence and phantom
fields. Our model is a generalization of the Noether symmetries of a single and
multiple components which have been investigated in detail before. We found the
general form of the quintom potential in which the whole dynamical system has a
point like symmetry. We investigated different possible solutions of the system
for diverse family of gauge function. Specially, we discovered two family of
potentials, one corresponds to a free quintessence (phantom) and the second is
in the form of quadratic interaction between two components. These two families
of potential functions are proposed from the symmetry point of view, but in the
quintom models they are used as phenomenological models without clear
mathematical justification. From integrability point of view, we found two
forms of the scale factor: one is power law and second is de-Sitter. Some
cosmological implications of the solutions have been investigated

mitigation of the electron cloud, emittance growth due to electron cloud,
intra-beam scattering, and ions, and single and multi-bunch instabilities
generated by collective effects. The flexibility of the CESR guide field optics

made possible an extraordinary range of experiments. Findings at CesrTA with
respect to electron cloud effects, emittance tuning techniques, and beam

free energy F in the CFTs with corresponding calculations in the higher spin
theories. This requires evaluating a regularized sum over one loop vacuum
energies of an infinite set of massless higher spin gauge fields in Euclidean
AdS4. For the Vasiliev theory including fields of all integer spin and a scalar
with Delta=1 boundary condition, we show that the regularized sum vanishes.
This is in perfect agreement with the vanishing of subleading corrections to F
in the U(N) singlet sector of the theory of N free complex scalar fields. For
the minimal Vasiliev theory including fields of only even spin, the regularized
sum remarkably equals the value of F for one free real scalar field. This
result may agree with the O(N) singlet sector of the theory of N real scalar
fields, provided the coupling constant in the Vasiliev theory is identified as
G_N ~ 1/(N-1). Similarly, consideration of the USp(N) singlet sector for N

discrete sources. Specifically, the focus is on lossy compression of
exponential and Laplacian sources, which is subsequently expanded using a
finite alphabet prior to being quantized. Due to decomposability property of
such sources, the resulting random variables post expansion are independent and
discrete. Thus, each of the expanded levels corresponds to an independent
discrete source coding problem, and the original problem is reduced to coding
over these parallel sources with a total distortion constraint. Any feasible
solution to the optimization problem is an achievable rate distortion pair of
the original continuous-valued source compression problem. Although finding the
solution to this optimization problem at every distortion is hard, we show that
our expansion coding scheme presents a good solution in the low distrotion
regime. Further, by adopting low-complexity codes designed for discrete source
coding, the total coding complexity can be tractable in practice.

theory. Many of the most important problems (such as Goldbach's conjecture and
Fermat's Last theorem) can be formulated in terms of the sumset $S + S = \{x+y
: x,y\in S\}$ of a set of integers $S$. A finite set of integers $A$ is
sum-dominated if $|A+A| > |A-A|$. Though it was believed that the percentage of
subsets of $\{0,...,n\}$ that are sum-dominated tends to zero, in 2006 Martin
and O'Bryant proved a very small positive percentage are sum-dominated if the
sets are chosen uniformly at random (through work of Zhao we know this
percentage is approximately $4.5 \cdot 10^{-4}$). While most sets are
difference-dominated in the integer case, this is not the case when we take
subsets of many finite groups. We show that if we take subsets of larger and
larger finite groups uniformly at random, then not only does the probability of
a set being sum-dominated tend to zero but the probability that $|A+A|=|A-A|$
tends to one, and hence a typical set is balanced in this case. The cause of
this marked difference in behavior is that subsets of $\{0,..., n\}$ have a
fringe, whereas finite groups do not. We end with a detailed analysis of
dihedral groups, where the results are in striking contrast to what occurs for

general undecidable even when data is abstracted and when the threads (with

paradigms that limit the lock usage patterns have been identified under which
the pairwise reachability problem becomes decidable. In this paper, we consider
a new natural programming paradigm, called contextual locking, which ties the
lock usage to calling patterns in each thread: we assume that locks are
released in the same context that they were acquired and that every lock
acquired by a thread in a procedure call is released before the procedure
returns. Our main result is that the pairwise reachability problem is
polynomial-time decidable for this new programming paradigm as well. The

\emph{recursive locking} mechanism which allows a thread in a multi-threaded

relevance assessment of tweets much more important for search. However, given
the limitations on the size of tweets, it is hard to extract measures for
ranking from the tweets' content alone. We present a novel ranking method,
called RAProp, which combines two orthogonal measures of relevance and
trustworthiness of a tweet. The first, called Feature Score, measures the
trustworthiness of the source of the tweet. This is done by extracting features
from a 3-layer twitter ecosystem, consisting of users, tweets and the pages
referred to in the tweets. The second measure, called agreement analysis,
estimates the trustworthiness of the content of the tweet, by analyzing how and
whether the content is independently corroborated by other tweets. We view the
candidate result set of tweets as the vertices of a graph, with the edges
measuring the estimated agreement between each pair of tweets. The feature
score is propagated over this agreement graph to compute the top-k tweets that
have both trustworthy sources and independent corroboration. The evaluation of
our method on 16 million tweets from the TREC 2011 Microblog Dataset shows that
for top-30 precision we achieve 53% higher than current best performing method
on the Dataset and over 300% over current Twitter Search. We also present a

attempts to intercept communications between an authorized transmitter-receiver

is imperative that the presence of an eavesdropper be determined before the
transmitter can deploy robust secrecyencoding schemes as a countermeasure. This
is a difficult task in general, since by definition the eavesdropper is passive
and never transmits. In this work we adopt a method that allows the legitimate
nodes to detect the passive eavesdropper from the local oscillator power that
is inadvertently leaked from its RF front end. We examine the performance of
non-coherent energy detection and optimal coherent detection, followed by
composite GLRT detection methods that account for unknown parameters. Numerical
experiments demonstrate that the proposed detectors allow the legitimate nodes
to increase the secrecy rate of the MIMO wiretap channel.

boxicity of a graph $G$, denoted by $\text{box}(G)$, is the minimum nonnegative

graph operation that extends a graph $G$ to a new graph $M(G)$, called the
Mycielski graph of $G$. In this paper, we observe behavior of the boxicity of
Mycielski graphs. The inequality $\text{box}(M(G))\geq \text{box}(G)$ holds for
a graph $G$, and hence we are interested in whether the boxicity of the
Mycielski graph of $G$ is more than that of $G$ or not. Here we give bounds for
the boxicity of Mycielski graphs: for a graph $G$ with $l$ universal vertices,
the inequalities $\text{box}(G)+\left \lceil \frac{l}{2}\right \rceil \leq

relations between the Mycielski graph $M(G)$ and its analogous ones $M_3(G)$

Such error will degrade network throughput, as we investigate in this paper.

simplified coarse-grained off-lattice Go model and CD experiments we have shown
the two-state behavior of hbSBD protein. It was shown that refolding pathways
of single Ubiquitin depend on what end is anchored to the surface. Namely, the
fixation of the N-terminal changes refolding pathways but anchoring the
C-terminal leaves them unchanged. Interestingly, the end fixation has no effect
on multi-domain Ubiquitin. Using the Go modeling and all-atom models with
explicit water, we have studied the mechanical unfolding mechanism of DDFLN4 in
detail. We predict that, contrary to the AFM experiments, an additional
unfolding peak would occur at the end-to-end $\Delta R \approx 1.5 $nm in the
force-extension curve. Our study reveals the important role of non-native
interactions which are responsible for a peak located at $\Delta R \approx 22
$nm. This peak can not be encountered by the Go models in which the non-native
interactions are neglected. Our finding may stimulate further experimental and
theoretical studies on this protein. The cooperativity of denaturation
transition was investigated using lattice and off-latice models. Our studies
reveal that the sharpness of the transition enhances as the number of amino
acids grows. The corresponding scaling behavior is governed by an universal
critical exponent. A new force replica exchange (RE) method was developed for
efficient configuration sampling of biomolecules pulled by an external
mechanical force. Contrary to the standard temperature RE, the exchange is
carried out between different forces (replicas). Our method was successfully
applied to study thermodynamics of a three-domain Ubiquitin.

scale ambiguity by absorbing the non-conformal $\{\beta_i\}$-terms into the
running coupling, and a more accurate pQCD estimation can be obtained. After
PMC scale setting, the QCD perturbative convergence can be greatly improved due
to the elimination of renormalon terms in pQCD series, and the BFKL Pomeron
intercept has a weak dependence on the virtuality of the reggeized gluon. For
example, by taking the Fried-Yennie gauge, we obtain $\omega_{\rm MOM}^{\rm
PMC}(Q^{2},0)\in [0.149,0.176]$ for $Q^2\in[1,100]\;{\rm GeV}^2$. This is a
good property to apply to the high-energy phenomenology. Further more, to
compare with the data, it is found that the physical ${\rm MOM}$-scheme is more
reliable than the $\overline{\rm MS}$-scheme. The ${\rm MOM}$-scheme is gauge
dependent, which can also be greatly suppressed after PMC scale setting. We
discuss the MOM-scheme gauge dependence for the Pomeron intercept by adopting
three gauges, i.e. the Landau gauge, the Feynman gauge and the Fried-Yennie
gauge, and we obtain $\omega_{\rm MOM}^{\rm PMC}(Q^{2}=15\;{\rm GeV}^2,0) =
0.166^{+0.010}_{-0.017}$; i.e. about $10\%$ gauge dependence is observed. We
apply the BFKL Pomeron intercept to the photon-photon collision process, and

descent algorithm that directly determines the time delay and magnitudes of two
noisy sinusoidal signals. The new estimator uses a novel quadrature carrier
generator to produce the carriers for an adaptive quadrature phase detector,
which in turn uses an arc tan function to compute the time delay. The proposed
method is quite robust and can adapt to significant variation in input signal
characteristics like magnitude and frequency imposing no requirement on the
magnitudes of the two signals. It even works effectively when the signals have
time-varying magnitudes. The convergence analysis of the proposed technique
shows that estimate converges exponentially fast to their nominal values. In
addition, if the technique is implemented in the continuous time domain, the
delay estimation accuracy will not be constrained by the sampling frequency as
observed in some of the classical techniques. Extensive simulations show that
the proposed method provides very accurate estimates of the time delay
comparable to that of the popular methods like Sinc-based estimator, Lagrange
estimator, and the Quadrature estimator, as well the magnitude estimate of the

$u^{\epsilon}$ of smooth functions solving the regularized levelset equations.
  We prove a rate for this convergence.
  Then we triangulate the domain by using a tetraeder mesh and consider
continuous finite elements, which are polynomials of degree $\le 2$ on each
tetraeder of the triangulation. We show in the case $n=1$ (i.e. the evolving
hypersurfaces are curves), that there are solutions $u^{\epsilon}_h$ of the
above regularized equations in the finite element sense, and estimate the
approximation error between $u^{\epsilon}_h$ and $u$.
  Our method can be extended to the case $n>1$, if one uses higher order finite

satisfactory results in the context of quantum state tomography for many-body

tomography has been considered to be infeasible for systems consisting of a
large number of subsystems due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space
dimension with the number of constituents. Several reconstruction schemes have
been proposed since then to overcome the two main obstacles in quantum
many-body tomography: experiment time and postprocessing resources. Here we
discuss one strategy to address these limitations for the maximum likelihood
principle by adopting a particular state representation to merge a well
established reconstruction algorithm maximizing the likelihood with techniques
known from quantum many-body theory.

about 11% were white dwarfs and red giants collectively, while galaxies and

objects into different spectral types (for the stars) and into different
galactic types (for the galaxies). As part of our fitting procedure, we derive
the distance and extinction to each object and the photometric redshift towards
galaxies and quasars. This method easily allows for the addition of any number
of observations to cover a more diverse range of wavelengths, as well as the
addition of any number of model templates. The primary objective of this work
is to eventually derive a 3-dimensional extinction map of the Milky Way galaxy.

bottleneck for the particle filter in applications where the observation
information is rich. For fast computing the likelihood of particles, a
numerical fitting approach is proposed to construct the Likelihood Probability
Density Function (Li-PDF) by using a comparably small number of so-called
fulcrums. The likelihood of particles is thereby analytically inferred,
explicitly or implicitly, based on the Li-PDF instead of directly computed by
utilizing the observation, which can significantly reduce the computation and
enables real time filtering. The proposed approach guarantees the estimation
quality when an appropriate fitting function and properly distributed fulcrums
are used. The details for construction of the fitting function and fulcrums are
addressed respectively in detail. In particular, to deal with multivariate
fitting, the nonparametric kernel density estimator is presented which is
flexible and convenient for implicit Li-PDF implementation. Simulation
comparison with a variety of existing approaches on a benchmark 1-dimensional
model and multi-dimensional robot localization and visual tracking demonstrate
the validity of our approach.

crystals to assemble colloidal particles trapped at the liquid crystal
interface into reconfigurable structures with complex symmetries and packings.
Spherical colloids with homeotropic anchoring trapped at the interface between
air and the nematic liquid crystal 5CB create quadrupolar distortions in the
director field causing particles to repel and consequently form close-packed
assemblies with a triangular habit. Here we report on complex, open structures
organized via interactions with defects in the bulk. Specifically, by confining
the nematic liquid crystal in an array of microposts with homeotropic anchoring
conditions, we cause defect rings to form at well-defined locations in the bulk
of the sample. These defects source elastic deformations that direct the
assembly of the interfacially-trapped colloids into ring-like assemblies, which
recapitulate the defect geometry even when the microposts are completely
immersed in the nematic. When the surface density of the colloids is high, they
form a ring near the defect and a hexagonal lattice far from it. Since
topographically complex substrates are easily fabricated and liquid crystal
defects are readily reconfigured, this work lays the foundation for a new,
robust mechanism to dynamically direct assembly over large areas by controlling
surface anchoring and associated bulk defect structure.

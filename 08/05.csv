spherical homogeneous SiO2 dust aggregates to investigate how the mass and the
porosity of the aggregates affects their ability to survive an impact at
various different collision velocities (between 1 - 27.5m/s). We explore how
the threshold velocities for fragmentation vary with these parameters.
Crucially, we find that the porosity plays a part of utmost importance in
determining the outcome of collisions. In particular, we find that aggregates
with filling factors >37% are significantly weakened and that the velocity
regime in which the aggregates grow is reduced or even non-existent (instead,
the aggregates either rebound off each other or break apart). At filling
factors less than ~37% we find that more porous objects are weaker but not as
weak as highly compact objects with filling factors >37%. In addition we find
that (for a given aggregate density) collisions between very different mass
objects have higher threshold velocities than those between very similar mass
objects. We find that fragmentation velocities are higher than the typical
values of 1m/s and that growth can even occur for velocities as high as
27.5m/s. Therefore, while the growth of aggregates is more likely if collisions
between different sized objects occurs or if the aggregates are porous with
filling factor <37%, it may also be hindered if the aggregates become too
compact.

systematically to investigate the flow patterns behind the accretion shock
waves that are commonly formed in the post-bounce phase of core-collapse
supernovae. Adding small perturbations to spherically symmetric, steady,
shocked accretion flows, we compute the subsequent evolutions to find what flow
pattern emerges as a consequence of hydrodynamical instabilities such as
convection and standing accretion shock instability (SASI) for different
neutrino luminosities and mass accretion rates. Depending on these two
controlling parameters, various flow patterns are indeed realized. We classify
them into three basic patterns and two intermediate ones; the former includes
sloshing motion (SL), spiral motion (SP) and multiple buoyant bubble formation
(BB); the latter consists of spiral motion with buoyant-bubble formation (SPB)
and spiral motion with pulsationally changing rotational velocities (SPP).
Although the post-shock flow is highly chaotic, there is a clear trend in the
pattern realization. The sloshing and spiral motions tend to be dominant for
high accretion rates and low neutrino luminosities, and multiple buoyant
bubbles prevail for low accretion rates and high neutrino luminosities. It is
interesting that the dominant pattern is not always identical between the
semi-nonlinear and nonlinear phases near the critical luminosity; the
intermediate cases are realized in the latter case. Running several simulations
with different random perturbations, we confirm that the realization of flow
pattern is robust in most cases.

binaries. They form in dense cores of molecular clouds that are observed to be
significantly magnetized. Our previous study shows that magnetic braking can
tighten the binary separation during the protostellar mass accretion phase by
removing the angular momentum of the accreting material. Recent numerical
calculations of single star formation have shown that misalignment between the
magnetic field and rotation axis may weaken both magnetic braking and the
associated magnetically driven outflows. These two effects allow for disk
formation even in strongly magnetized cores. Here we investigate the effects of
magnetic field misalignment on the properties of protobinaries. Somewhat
surprisingly, the misaligned magnetic field is more efficient at tightening the
binary orbit compared to the aligned field. The main reason is that the
misalignment weakens the magnetically-driven outflow, which allows more
material to accrete onto the binary. Even though the specific angular momentum
of this inner material is higher than in the aligned case, it is insufficient
to compensate for the additional mass. A corollary of this result is that a
weaker field is required to achieve the same degree of inward migration when
the field is tilted relative to the rotation axis. Large field misalignment
also helps to produce rotationally-supported circumbinary disks even for
relatively strong magnetic fields, by weakening the magnetically-dominated
structure close to the binary. Our result may provide an explanation for the
circumbinary disks detected in recent SMA and ALMA observations.

structure by Beame and Fich for predecessor search. We also prove results about
their space complexity (how many bits are required) and time complexity (how
many bits have to be read to answer a query). After that, we turn our attention
to classical data structures with quantum access. In the quantum access model,
data is stored in classical bits, but they can be accessed in a quantum way: We
may read several bits in superposition for unit cost. We give proofs for lower
bounds in this setting that show that the classical data structures from the
first section are, in some sense, asymptotically optimal - even in the quantum
model. In fact, these proofs are simpler and give stronger results than
previous proofs for the classical model of computation. The lower bound for set
membership was proved by Radhakrishnan, Sen and Venkatesh and the result for
the predecessor problem by Sen and Venkatesh. Finally, we examine fully quantum
data structures. Instead of encoding the data in classical bits, we now encode
it in qubits. We allow any unitary operation or measurement in order to answer
queries. We describe one data structure by de Wolf for the set membership
problem and also a general framework using fully quantum data structures in
quantum walks by Jeffery, Kothari and Magniez.

matter imposed by X-ray observations. We show that over-abundance of thermally
produced warm dark matter (which nevertheless do not reach chemical
equilibrium) can be reduced to an acceptable range in the presence of a moduli
field decaying into radiation --- though only when the reheat temperature is
low enough. Our warm dark matter candidate can also be produced directly from
the decay of the moduli field during reheating. In this case, obtaining the
right amount of relic abundance, while keeping the reheat temperature high

constraints on the branching ratio for the decay of the moduli field into dark

where each individual cloud's workload and cost information is known. Taking
into consideration jobs with disparate lengths, a non-preemptive approximation
algorithm for leftover job migration and new job scheduling is designed. Given
to the selfishness of individual clouds, we further design a randomized double
auction mechanism to elicit clouds' truthful bidding for buying or selling
virtual machines. We evaluate our algorithms using trace-driven simulations.

recent compact continuous-variable entanglement distillation protocol [Phys.
Rev. Lett. 108, 060502, (2012)] implemented using realistic quantum memories.
We show that the decoherence undergone by a two-mode squeezed state while
stored in a quantum memory can strongly modify the results of the preparatory
step of the protocol. We find that the well-known method for locally increasing
entanglement, phonon subtraction, may not result in entanglement gain when
losses are taken into account. Thus, we investigate the critical number $m_c$
of phonon subtraction attempts from the matter modes of the quantum memory. If
the initial state is not de-Gaussified within $m_c$ attempts, the protocol
should be restarted to obtain any entanglement increase. Moreover, the
condition $m_c>1$ implies an additional constraint on the subtraction beam
splitter interaction transmissivity, viz. it should be about 50% for a wide
range of protocol parameters. Additionally, we consider the average
entanglement rate, which takes into account both the unavoidable probabilistic
nature of the protocol and its possible failure as a result of a large number
of unsuccessful subtraction attempts. We find that a higher value of the
average entanglement can be achieved by increasing the subtraction beam
splitter interaction transmissivity. We conclude that the compact distillation
protocol with the practical constraints coming from realistic quantum memories
allows a feasible experimental realization within existing technologies.

dex. The average metallicity of the stream is -2.1 dex, identical to the value
obtained by Newberg et al. (2010) using blue horizontal branch stars. We find
that the most distant parts of the stream (40-50 kpc from the Sun) are about
0.3 dex more metal-poor than the closer parts (within ~30 kpc), suggesting a
possible metallicity gradient along the stream's length. We have extended the
previous studies and have mapped the stream up to 55 kpc from the Sun. Even
after a careful search, we did not identify any more distant RRab stars that
could plausibly be members of the Orphan stream. If confirmed with other
tracers, this result would indicate a detection of the end of the leading arm
of the stream. We have compared the distances of Orphan stream RRab stars with
the best-fit orbits obtained by Newberg et al. (2010). We find that model 6 of
Newberg et al. (2010) cannot explain the distances of the most remote Orphan
stream RRab stars, and conclude that the best fit to distances of Orphan stream
RRab stars and to the local circular velocity is provided by potentials where
the total mass of the Galaxy within 60 kpc is M_{60}~2.7x10^{11} Msun, or about
60% of the mass found by previous studies. More extensive modelling that would
consider non-spherical potentials and the possibility of misalignment between

viewing it as a stochastic hybrid system and developing a Stochastic Flow Model

information defined by detecting whether vehicle backlog is above or below a
certain threshold, without the need to observe an exact vehicle count. The
policy is parameterized by green and red cycle lengths which depend on this
partial state information. Using Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis (IPA), we
derive online gradient estimators of an average traffic congestion metric with
respect to these controllable green and red cycle lengths when the vehicle
backlog is above or below the threshold. The estimators are used to iteratively
adjust light cycle lengths so as to improve performance and, in conjunction
with a standard gradient-based algorithm, to seek optimal values which adapt to
changing traffic conditions. Simulation results are included to illustrate the

increase of the intra-band conductivity due to the large variation of electron

negative differential transmission is shown to tend to appear with the
hot-electron temperature being closer to the equilibrium one and the chemical

any spectrograph, but its definition is vague because the `smallest resolvable
wavelength difference' delta lambda does not have a consistent definition.
Often the FWHM is used, but this is not consistent when comparing the
resolution of instruments with different forms of spectral line spread
function. Here two methods for calculating resolving power on a consistent
scale are given. The first is based on the principle that two spectral lines
are just resolved when the mutual disturbance in fitting the fluxes of the
lines reaches a threshold (here equal to that of sinc^2 profiles at the
Rayleigh criterion). The second criterion assumes that two spectrographs have
equal resolving powers if the wavelength error in fitting a narrow spectral
line is the same in each case (given equal signal flux and noise power). The
two criteria give similar results, and give rise to scaling factors which can
be applied to bring resolving power calculated using the FWHM on to a
consistent scale. The differences among commonly encountered Line Spread
Functions are substantial, with a Lorentzian profile (as produced by an imaging
Fabry-Perot interferometer) being a factor of two worse than the boxy profile
from a projected circle (as produced by integration across the spatial
dimension of a multi-mode fibre) when both have the same FWHM. The projected
circle has a larger FWHM in comparison with its true resolution, so using FWHM
to characterise the resolution of a spectrograph which is fed by multi-mode
fibres significantly underestimates its true resolving power if it has small
aberrations and a well-sampled profile.

in the UV band and the peak of lightcurve progressively shifts to an earlier
epoch with increasing frequency. A magnetar-powered mergernova could have an
optical peak brightness comparable to a supernova, which is a few tens or
hundreds times brighter than the radioactive-powered merger-novae (the
so-called macro-nova or kilo-nova). On the other hand, such a merger-nova would
peak earlier and have a significantly shorter duration than that of a
supernova. An early collapse of the magnetar could suppress the brightness of
the optical emission and shorten its duration. Such
millisecond-magnetar-powered merger-novae may be detected from NS-NS merger
events without an observed short gamma-ray burst, and could be a bright
electromagnetic counterpart for gravitational wave bursts due to NS-NS mergers.
If detected, it suggests that the merger leaves behind a massive NS, which has
important implications for the equation-of-state of nuclear matter.

oscillator, share some common response structures with other biological
oscillations. In this study, we analyze the dependence of the global dynamics
of an impulse-driven stochastic neuronal oscillator on the relaxation rate to
the limit cycle, the strength of the intrinsic noise, and the impulsive input
parameters. To do this, we use a Markov operator that both reflects the density
evolution of the oscillator and is an extension of the phase transition curve,
which describes the phase shift due to a single isolated impulse. Previously,
we derived the Markov operator for the finite relaxation rate that describes
the dynamics of the entire phase plane. Here, we construct a Markov operator
for the infinite relaxation rate that describes the stochastic dynamics
restricted to the limit cycle. In both cases, the response of the stochastic
neuronal oscillator to time-varying impulses is described by a product of
Markov operators. Furthermore, we calculate the number of spikes between two
consecutive impulses to relate the dynamics of the oscillator to the number of
spikes per unit time and the interspike interval density. Specifically, we
analyze the dynamics of the number of spikes per unit time based on the
properties of the Markov operators. Each Markov operator can be decomposed into
stationary and transient components based on the properties of the eigenvalues
and eigenfunctions. This allows us to evaluate the difference in the number of
spikes per unit time between the stationary and transient responses of the
oscillator, which we show to be based on the dependence of the oscillator on
past activity. Our analysis shows how the duration of the past neuronal
activity depends on the relaxation rate, the noise strength and the input
parameters.

plasmas by the influence of hot-electron refluxing has been found via
particle-in-cell simulations. When a p-polarized laser pulse, with intensity
below the self-induced-transparency (SIT) threshold, obliquely irradiates a
thin overdense plasma, the initially opaque plasma would become transparent
after a time interval which linearly relies on the thickness of the plasma.
This phenomenon can be interpreted by the influence of hot-electron refluxing.
As the laser intensity is higher than the SIT threshold, the penetration
velocity of the laser in the plasma is enhanced when the refluxing is
presented. Simulation data with ion motion considered is also consistent with
the assumption that hot-electron refluxing enhances transparency. These results
have potential applications in laser shaping.

  Welcome",,"10.1093/mnras/stt1196",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a study of the environments of extended radio sources in the
Australia Telescope Low Brightness Survey (ATLBS). The radio sources were
selected from the Extended Source Sample (ATLBS-ESS), which is a well defined
sample containing the most extended of radio sources in the ATLBS sky survey
regions. The environments were analyzed using 4-m CTIO Blanco telescope
observations carried out for ATLBS fields in the SDSS ${\rm r}^{\prime}$ band.
We have estimated the properties of the environments using smoothed density
maps derived from galaxy catalogs constructed using these optical imaging data.
The angular distribution of galaxy density relative to the axes of the radio
sources has been quantified by defining anisotropy parameters that are
estimated using a new method presented here. Examining the anisotropy
parameters for a sub-sample of extended double radio sources that includes all
sources with pronounced asymmetry in lobe extents, we find good evidence for
environmental anisotropy being the dominant cause for lobe asymmetry in that
higher galaxy density occurs almost always on the side of the shorter lobe, and
this validates the usefulness of the method proposed and adopted here. The
environmental anisotropy parameters have been used to examine and compare the
environments of FRI and FRII radio sources in two redshift regimes ($z<0.5$ and
$z>0.5$). Wide-angle tail sources and Head-tail sources lie in the most
overdense environments. The Head-tail source environments (for the HT sources
in our sample) display dipolar anisotropy in that higher galaxy density appears
to lie in the direction of the tails. Excluding the Head-tail and Wide-angle
tail sources, subsamples of FRI and FRII sources from the ATLBS survey appear
to lie in similar moderately overdense environments, with no evidence for
redshift evolution in the regimes studied herein.

peculiar velocity into three eigen-modes (v_\delta, v_S and v_B) in order to
facilitate the RSD modeling and peculiar velocity reconstruction. In the
current paper we measure the dark matter RSD related statistics of the velocity
eigen-modes through a set of N-body simulations, including the velocity power
spectra, correlation functions, one-point probability distribution functions,
cumulants and the damping functions describing the Finger of God effect. (1)
The power spectrum measurement shows that these velocity components have
distinctly different spatial distribution and redshift evolution. In
particular, we measure the window function \tilde{W}(k,z), which describes the
impact of nonlinear evolution on the v_\delta-density relation. We confirm that
it can induce a significant systematic error of O(10%) in RSD cosmology. We
demonstrate that \tilde{W} can be accurately described by a simple fitting
formula with one or two free parameters. (2) The correlation function
measurement shows that the correlation length is O(100), O(10) and O(1) Mpc for
v_\delta, v_S and v_B respectively. These correlation lengths determine where
we can treat the velocity fields as spatially uncorrelated. (3) The velocity
PDFs and cumulants quantify non-Gaussianities of the velocity fields. We
confirm speculation in paper I that v_\delta is largely Gaussian, nevertheless
with non-negligible non-Gaussianity, v_B is significantly non-Gaussian. We also
measure the damping functions. Despite the observed non-Gaussianities, the
damping functions and hence the FOG effect are all well approximated as
Gaussian ones at scales of interest.

evolution of the system due to mass loss from an accretion disk as a result of
propeller action and from the companion via ablation by the pulsar, the
transition from the accretion powered to rotation powered phase is
investigated. It is shown that the operation of the propeller and ablation
mechanisms can be responsible for the formation and evolution of black widow
millisecond pulsar systems from the low mass X-ray binary phase at an orbital
period of ~0.1 day. For a range of population synthesis input parameters, the
results reveal that a population of black widow millisecond pulsars
characterized by orbital periods as long as ~0.4 days and companion masses as
low as ~0.005 Msun can be produced. The orbital periods and minimum companion
mass of this radio millisecond pulsar population critically depend on the
thermal bloating of the semi-degenerate hydrogen mass losing component, with
longer orbital periods for a greater degree of bloating. Provided that the
radius of the companion is increased by about a factor of 2 relative to a fully
degenerate, zero temperature configuration, an approximate agreement between
observed long orbital periods and theoretical modeling of hydrogen rich donors
can be achieved. We find no discrepancy between the estimated birth rates for

pressure and atmospheric composition) for this feedback. A plane-parallel
radiative transfer model is used for the calculation of planetary albedos. We
varied CO2 partial pressures as well as the H2O, CH4, and O3 content in the
atmosphere for planets orbiting Sun-like and M-type stars.
  Results suggest that for planets around M stars, the ice-albedo effect is
significantly reduced, compared to planets around Sun-like stars. Including the
effects of an atmosphere further suppresses the sensitivity to the ice-albedo
effect. Atmospheric key properties such as surface pressure, but also the
abundance of radiative trace gases can considerably change the strength of the
ice-albedo feedback. For dense CO2 atmospheres of the order of a few to tens of
bar, atmospheric rather than surface properties begin to dominate the planetary
radiation budget. At high CO2 pressures, the ice-albedo feedback is strongly
reduced for planets around M stars. The presence of trace amounts of H2O and
CH4 in the atmosphere also weakens the ice-albedo effect for both stellar types
considered. For planets around Sun-like stars, O3 could also lead to a very
strong decrease of the ice-albedo feedback at high CO2 pressures. (abridged)

give the first examples of proper Bryant surfaces with finite topology and of
hyperbolic conformal type. The main novelty when compared to the existing

complex analytic techniques. One of our main tools is an approximate solution
to the Riemann-Hilbert boundary value problem for null curves in

to schedule their transmissions so that they can singly, transmit their
messages on MAC, based only on the feedback received from the MAC in previous

  For the above problem it was shown in [Greenberg, Winograd, {\em A Lower
bound on the Time Needed in the Worst Case to Resolve Conflicts

deterministic adaptive algorithm should take $\Omega(d (\lg n)/(\lg d))$ rounds

$O(d \lg n)$ rounds. The gap between the upper and lower bound is $O(\lg d)$

\in O(n^{\epsilon})$ (for any constant $\epsilon \leq 1$, the lower bound is
respectively $O(\lg n)$ and O(n), which is trivial in both cases. Nevertheless,
the above lower bound is interesting indeed when $d \in$ poly($\lg n$). In this

which we construct a flow of operators parametrized by a continuous variable in
the positive real axis. While this is in contrast to the discrete iteration
used before, this is more in spirit of the original formulation of the
renormalization group introduced in theoretical physics in 1974
\cite{KogutWilson1974}. The renormalization flow that we construct can be
expressed in a simple way: it can be viewed as a single application of the
Feshbach-Schur map with a clever selection of the spectral parameter. Another
advantage of the method is that there exists a flow function for which the
renormalization group that we present is the orbit under this flow of an
initial Hamiltonian. This opens the possibility to study the problem using
different techniques coming from the theory of evolution equations.

1) are resilient to link failures; 2) computationally cheap; and 3) improve
convergence rates over other gradient methods. We model the network by a
sequence of independent, identically distributed random matrices {W(k)} drawn
from the set of symmetric, stochastic matrices with positive diagonals. The
network is connected on average and the cost functions are convex,
differentiable, with Lipschitz continuous and bounded gradients. We design two
distributed Nesterov-like gradient methods that modify the D-NG and D-NC
methods that we proposed for static networks. We prove their convergence rates
in terms of the expected optimality gap at the cost function. Let k and K be
the number of per-node gradient evaluations and per-node communications,
respectively. Then the modified D-NG achieves rates O(log k/k) and O(\log K/K),
and the modified D-NC rates O(1/k^2) and O(1/K^{2-\xi}), where \xi>0 is
arbitrarily small. For comparison, the standard distributed gradient method
cannot do better than \Omega(1/k^{2/3}) and \Omega(1/K^{2/3}), on the same
class of cost functions (even for static networks). Simulation examples

different superfluid systems: ultracold and dilute atomic gases, bulk neutron
matter, and neutron stars. In the case of dilute gases made of fermionic atoms
the average distance between atoms is much larger than the effective radius of
the inter-atomic potential. Here the condensation of fermionic pairs is
analyzed as a function of the s-wave scattering length, which can be tuned in
experiments by using the technique of Feshbach resonances from a small and
negative value (corresponding to the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) regime of
Cooper Fermi pairs) to a small and positive value (corresponding to the regime
of the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of molecular dimers), crossing the
unitarity regime where the scattering length diverges. In the case of bulk
neutron matter the s-wave scattering length of neutron-neutron potential is
negative but fixed, and the condensate fraction of neutron-neutron pairs is
studied as a function of the total neutron density. Our results clearly show a
BCS-quasiunitary-BCS crossover by increasing the neutron density. Finally, in
the case of neutron stars, where again the neutron-neutron scattering length is
negative and fixed, we determine the condensate fraction as a function of the
distance from the center of the neutron star, finding that the maximum
condensate fraction appears in the crust of the neutron star.

only two largest exchange integrals, then according to the ratio x\equiv

complex (BzV) adsorbed on a single atomic layer of Mn deposited on the W(110)
surface -- a surface which exhibits a nearly antiferromagnetic alignment of the
magnetic moments in adjacent Mn rows. Due to the spin-dependent hybridization
of the molecular pz orbitals with the d states of the Mn monolayer there is a
significant reduction of the magnetic moments in the Mn film. Furthermore, the
spin-polarization at this organic-antiferromagnetic interface is found to be
modulated on the atomic scale, both enhanced and inverted, as a result of the
molecular adsorption. We show that this effect can be resolved by
spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (SP-STM). Our simulated SP-STM

an adsorbed molecule -- i.e., different regions above the molecule sustain
different signs of spin polarization. While states with s and p symmetry
dominate the vacuum charge density in the vicinity of the Fermi energy for the
clean magnetic surface, we demonstrate that after a molecule is adsorbed those
d-states, which are normally suppressed due to their symmetry, can play a
crucial role in the vacuum due to their interaction with the molecular
orbitals. We also model the effect of small deviations from perfect

energetics of a large number (more than a few hundred) of marine turbines
installed as a power farm in a general coastal environment. The kernel of this
approach is that the outer, or coastal-scale, model/simulation is to assess the
reduction of flow passing through a given farm area as a function of the
increase of head loss across the farm, whereas the inner, or device-scale,
model/simulation employs this function to account for the (otherwise unknown)
effect of coastal dynamics for that farm site, i.e. diminution of the power
removed from the farm area due to the reduction of flow through the farm.
Large-eddy simulations (LES) of periodic open channel flow (with a porous plate
model representing turbines) are then presented as a device-scale part of such
a two-scale model of large marine turbine arrays. Results demonstrate the
usefulness of this approach to study how the overall energetics of turbine
arrays (i.e. extraction, dissipation and diminution of energy within the entire
farm area) may change depending on the characteristics of the farm site, array
configuration and operating conditions of the turbines in the farm.

pulsars, thus offering a unique laboratory to test general relativity and
explore pulsar physics. Based on the low eccentricity and the position within
the galactic plane, Piran & Shaviv (2004, 2005) argued that pulsar B had a
non-standard formation scenario with little or no mass ejection. They have also
predicted that the system would have a very slow proper motion. Pulsar timing
measurements (Kramer et al. 2006; Deller et al. 2009) confirmed this
prediction. The recent observations of the alignment between the spin of pulsar
A and the binary orbit is also in agreement with this scenario. Detailed
simulations of the formation process of pulsar B enable us to show that its
progenitor, just before the collapse, was a massive O-Ne-Mg white dwarf
surrounded by a tenuous, 0.1-0.16 M_sun, envelope. This envelope was ejected
when the white dwarf collapsed to form a neutron star. Pulsar B was born as a
slow rotator (spin period ~ 1 s) and a kick received when the pulsar formed
changed its spin direction to the current one. This realization sheds light on
the angular momentum evolution of the progenitor star, a process which is
strongly affected by interaction with the binary companion. The slow proper
motion of the system also implies that the system must have undergone a phase
of mass transfer in which Star A shed a significant fraction of its mass onto
B.

representing different star formation histories. This has been accomplished
hitherto by parametrising the model star formation history as a histogram,
usually with the bin widths set by fixed increases in the logarithm of time. A
best fit is then found with maximum likelihood methods and we consider the
different means by which a likelihood can be calculated. We then apply Bayesian
methods by parametrising the star formation history as an unknown number of
Gaussian bursts with unknown parameters. This parametrisation automatically
provides a smooth function of time. A Reversal Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo
method is then used to find both the most appropriate number of Gaussians, thus
avoiding avoid overfitting, and the posterior probability distribution of the
star formation rate. We apply our method to artificial populations and to
observed data. We discuss the other advantages of the method: direct comparison
of different parametrisations and the ability to calculate the probability that
a given star is from a given Gaussian. This allows the investigation of
possible sub-populations.

AO-assisted Ks- and Lp-band observations, obtained at the ESO VLT. High
precision photometry and the new polarimetric calibration method for NACO allow
us to map the polarization in a region of 8"" x 25"" (Ks) resp. 26"" x 28"" (Lp).
These are the first polarimetric observations of the GC in the Lp-band in 30
years, with vastly improved spatial resolution compared to previous results.
This allows resolved polarimetry on bright bow-shock sources in this area for
the first time at this wavelength. We find foreground polarization to be
largely parallel to the Galactic plane (Ks-band: 6.1% at 20 degrees, Lp-band:
4.5% at 20 degrees, in good agreement with our previous findings and with older
results. The previously described Lp-band excess in the foregound polarization
towards the GC could be confirmed here for a much larger number of sources. The
bow-shock sources contained in the FOV seem to show a different relation
between the polarization in the observed wavelength bands than what was
determined for the foreground. This points to the different relevant
polarization mechanisms. The resolved polarization patterns of IRS 5 and 10W
match the findings we presented earlier for IRS~1W. Additionally, intrinsic
Lp-band polarization was measured for IRS 1W and 21, as well as for other, less
prominent MIR-excess sources (IRS 2S, 2L, 5NE). The new data offer support for
the presumed bow-shock nature of several of these sources (1W, 5, 5NE, 10W, 21)

of deleterious mutations decreases as the population size is increased. We
calculate exactly the steady state frequency in a nonrecombining population
when population size is infinite and for a neutral finite population, and
obtain bounds on the fraction of deleterious mutations. We also find that for
small and very large populations, the number of deleterious mutations depends
weakly on recombination, but for moderately large populations, recombination
alleviates the effect of deleterious mutations. An analytical argument shows
that recombination decreases disadvantageous mutations appreciably when
beneficial mutations are rare as is the case in adapting microbial populations,
whereas it has a moderate effect on codon bias where the mutation rates between
the preferred and unpreferred codons are comparable.

compare the recombination amplitude, from a continuum state described by a

noble gases that are commonly used in HHG. These calculations are based on the
single active electron model and the Hartree-Fock-Slater method, using both the
length form and the acceleration form of the dipole matrix element. We confirm
that the recombination amplitude versus emitted photon energy strongly depends
upon the wavefunction used to describe the free electron. Depending on the
choice of the wavefunction and the dipole form, the square of the absolute
value of the recombination amplitude can differ by almost two orders of
magnitude near the experimentally measured Cooper minima. Moreover, only the
outgoing scattering eigenstates with the length form roughly predict the
experimentally observed Cooper minimum for Ar (~50 eV) and Kr (~85 eV). We
provide a detailed derivation of the photorecombination cross sections (PRCSs)
from photo ionization cross sections (PICSs) calculated by the relativistic
random phase approximation (RRPA)., For Ar, Kr and Xe, compare the total PICSs

including sociology, biology, neuroscience and computer science. In most of the
aforementioned cases graphs are directed - in the sense that there is
directionality on the edges, making the semantics of the edges non symmetric.
An interesting feature that real networks present is the clustering or
community structure property, under which the graph topology is organized into
modules commonly called communities or clusters. The essence here is that nodes
of the same community are highly similar while on the contrary, nodes across
communities present low similarity. Revealing the underlying community
structure of directed complex networks has become a crucial and
interdisciplinary topic with a plethora of applications. Therefore, naturally
there is a recent wealth of research production in the area of mining directed
graphs - with clustering being the primary method and tool for community
detection and evaluation. The goal of this paper is to offer an in-depth review
of the methods presented so far for clustering directed networks along with the
relevant necessary methodological background and also related applications. The
survey commences by offering a concise review of the fundamental concepts and
methodological base on which graph clustering algorithms capitalize on. Then we
present the relevant work along two orthogonal classifications. The first one
is mostly concerned with the methodological principles of the clustering
algorithms, while the second one approaches the methods from the viewpoint
regarding the properties of a good cluster in a directed network. Further, we
present methods and metrics for evaluating graph clustering results,
demonstrate interesting application domains and provide promising future
research directions.

gamma-ray pulsars have been discovered with intriguing properties challenging
our current understanding of pulsar physics. Observation of the Crab pulsar
furnish today a broad band analysis of the pulsed spectrum with phase-resolved
variability allowing to refine existing model to explain pulse shape, spectra
and polarization properties. The latter gives inside into the geometry of the
emitting region as well as on the structure of the magnetic field. Based on an
exact analytical solution of the striped wind with finite current sheet
thickness, we analyze in detail the phase-resolved polarization variability
emanating from the synchrotron radiation. We assume that the main contribution
to the wind emissivity comes from a thin transition layer where the dominant
toroidal magnetic field reverses its polarity, the so-called current sheet. The
resulting radiation is mostly linearly polarized. In the off-pulse region, the
electric vector lies in the direction of the projection onto the plane of the
sky of the rotation axis of the pulsar. This property is unique to the wind
model and in good agreement with the Crab data. Other properties such as a
reduced degree of polarization and a characteristic sweep of the polarization
angle within the pulses are also reproduced. These properties are qualitatively
unaffected by variations of the wind Lorentz factor, the lepton injection power
law index, the contrast in hot and cold particle, the obliquity of the pulsar
and the inclination of the line of sight.

discovered almost 20 years ago, but currently there is still lack of consensus
on the microscopic mechanism responsible for the corresponding transfer of
angular momentum and energy between electron, lattice and spin subsystems. A
distinct, but intrinsically correlated phenomenon occurring on a longer
timescale is the magnetization precession after the ultrafast demagnetization
process, if a magnetic field is applied to tilt the magnetization vector away
from its easy direction, which can be attributed to the change of anisotropy
after laser heating. In an in-plane magnetized Pt/Co/Pt thin film with
perpendicular interface anisotropy, we found excellent agreement between
theoretical prediction with plausible parameters and experimental data measured
using time resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect. This agreement confirms that
the time evolution of the anisotropy field, which is driven by the interaction
between electrons and phonons, determines the magnetization precession
completely. A detailed analysis shows that, even though the whole sample is
magnetized in-plane, the dynamic interface anisotropy field dictates the
initial phase of the magnetization precession, highlighting the significance of
the interface anisotropy field in laser induced magnetization precession.

the socially optimal equilibrium in an IDS game through a message exchange

closing the Price of Anarchy gap in the IDS game, (2) it is applicable to a
general model of user interdependencies. We further consider the issue of
individual rationality, often a trivial condition to satisfy in many resource

stay out and free-ride on others' investment can make individual rationality
much harder to satisfy in designing a mechanism.

connected to two noninteracting leads in a nonequilibrium steady state. In the
limit of high bias voltages, and also in the high-temperature limit at thermal
equilibrium, the model can be mapped on to an effective non-Hermitian
Hamiltonian consisting of two sites, which correspond to the original impurity
and its image that is defined in a doubled Hilbert space referred to as
Liouville-Fock space. For this, we provide a heuristic derivation using a
path-integral representation of the Keldysh contour and the thermal field
theory, in which the time evolution along the backward contour is replicated by
extra degrees of freedom corresponding to the image. We find that the effective
Hamiltonian can also be expressed in terms of charges and currents. From this,
it can be deduced that the dynamic susceptibilities for the charges and the
current fluctuations become independent of the Coulomb repulsion U in the high
bias limit. Furthermore, the equation of motions for the Green's function and
two other higher-order correlation functions constitute a closed system. The
exact solution obtained from the three coupled equations extends the
atomic-limit solution such that the self-energy correctly captures the
imaginary part caused by the relaxation processes at high energies. The
spectral weights of the upper and lower Hubbard levels depend sensitively on
the asymmetry in the tunneling couplings to the left and right leads.

equation $\dt g = S(g)$, where a geometric functional $S(g)$ is a symmetric

curvature of a foliated manifold regulates the deviation of leaves along the
leaf geodesics. We introduce and study the flow of metrics on a foliation
(called the 'Partial Ricci Flow'), where $S=-2 r$ and $r$ is the partial Ricci
curvature of the foliation; in other words, the velocity for a unit vector $X$
orthogonal to the leaf, $-2 r(X,X)$, is the mean value of sectional curvatures

  The flow preserves totally geodesic foliations and is used to examine the

question about dimension of totally geodesic foliations with positive mixed

  We first consider a one-dimensional foliation, since this case is easier. We

converge to one with constant mixed sectional curvature.

The system chosen is a monolayer of Fe on W(1 1 0) which is known to exhibit a
large anisotropy while having a soft exchange, resulting in a very narrow
domain wall. The study is performed by means of atomistic spin dynamics
simulations coupled to first-principles calculations. By subjecting the systems
to a thermal gradient we observe a temperature dependent movement of the domain
wall as well as changes of the spatial magnetization profile of the system. The
thermal gradient always makes the domain wall move towards the hotter region of
the sample with a velocity proportional to the gradient. The material specific
study is complemented by model simulations to discern the interplay between the
thermal gradient, magnetic anisotropy and the exchange interaction, and shows
that the larger DW velocities are found for materials with low magnetic
anisotropy. The relatively slow DW motion of the Fe/W(1 1 0) system is hence
primarily caused by its large magnetic anisotropy.

are bent in a completely different direction. We conclude that the complex
radio emission associated with the cluster BCG is the result of a minor merger
event in A3560. The aged diffuse emission is strongly affected by the sloshing
motion in the ICM. On the other hand, the bent jets and lobes of the current
radio AGN activity may reflect a complex gas velocity field in the innermost
cluster regions and/or sloshing-induced oscillations in the motion of the cD
galaxy.

selection effects could prevent the detection of other bursts at larger

``constant'' or the Planck mass, depends on the value of a scalar field, the
cosmon. We discuss two simple four-parameter models with a quadratic or
constant cosmon potential. They are compatible with all presently available
cosmological observations, including inflation. The inflaton and the scalar
field of quintessence are the same cosmon field. Dark Energy constitutes a
small, almost constant fraction of the energy density during the radiation and
matter dominated epochs (Early Dark Energy). In the present epoch we witness a
transition to a new Dark Energy dominated epoch. Our models are free of a big
bang singularity. The stability of solutions generates an arrow of time. Our
picture of the Universe is unusual, with a shrinking or static scale factor,
while the masses of particles increase and the size of atoms shrinks. The
evolution of the universe can be very slow for all cosmological epochs
including inflation, with typical time scale $10^{10}$ yr, and in sharp
contrast to the usual big bang picture. The map to the equivalent Einstein
frame with constant particle masses and expanding scale factor can be singular
at the big bang.

supersymmetric (SUSY) models with exact custodial symmetry that forbids
tree-level flavor-changing transitions and the most dangerous baryon and lepton
number violating operators. In these models there are two states which are
absolutely stable and can contribute to the dark matter density. One of them is
the lightest SUSY particle (LSP) which is expected to be lighter than 1 eV
forming hot dark matter in the Universe. The presence of another stable neutral
state allows to account for the observed cold dark matter density. In the
considered SUSY models next-to-lightest SUSY particle (NLSP) also tend to be
light. We argue that the NLSP with GeV scale mass can result in the substantial
branching ratio of the nonstadard decays of the lightest Higgs boson.

then give concrete applications to various problems in number theory, such as
the first primitive root modulo a prime $\ell$, the factorization of an
integral polynomial modulo primes, the Lang-Trotter conjecture and its

considering the Kratzer potential in a Bohr Hamiltonian, in which the mass is
allowed to depend on the nuclear deformation, and solving it by using
techniques of supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSYQM), involving a deformed
shape invariance condition. Analytical expressions for spectra and wave
functions are derived for separable potentials in the cases of gamma-unstable
nuclei, axially symmetric prolate deformed nuclei, and triaxial nuclei,
implementing the usual approximations in each case. Spectra and B(E2)
transition rates are compared to experimental data. The dependence of the mass
on the deformation, dictated by SUSYQM for the potential used, moderates the
increase of the moment of inertia with deformation, removing a main drawback of
the model.

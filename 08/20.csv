``scale-freeness'' restricted to the collection G(D) of connected graphs with a
common degree sequence D=(d_1,\ldots,d_n). The calculation of S depends on the
maximum possible degree assortativity r among graphs in G(D). The original
method involves a heuristic construction of a maximally assortative graph g*.
The approximation by Beichl and Cloteaux involves constructing a possibly
disconnected graph g' with r(g') >= r(g*) and requires O(n^2) tests for the
graphicality of a degree sequence. The present paper uses the Tripathi-Vijay
test to streamline this approximation, and thereby to investigate two
collections of graphs: Barabasi-Albert trees and coauthorship graphs of
mathematical sciences researchers. Long-term trends in the coauthorship graphs
are discussed, and contextualized by insights derived from the BA trees. It is
known that greater degree-based preferential attachment produces greater
variance in degree sequences, and these trees exhibited assortativities
restricted to a narrow band. In contrast, variance in degree rose over time in
the coauthorship graphs in spite of weakening degree-based preferential
attachment. These observations and their implications are discussed and avenues
of future work are suggested.

photometric calibration accuracy (repeatability) is as good as 1% in the blue

inconsistencies among the stellar calibration models become visible and amount
to 2% for the five standard stars used. The absolute calibration accuracy is
therefore mainly limited by the model uncertainty, which is 5% for all three

represented by unstable separatrices of the saddle points. Only critical point
itself located on two dimensional stable submanifold can be identified as
scaling solution. We have also found a class of potentials of the scalar fields
forced by the symmetry of differential equation describing the evolution of the

given. We point out the role of the notion of a structural stability in the

the \Lambda CDM model, which is known to be structurally stable. We show that
the structural stability issue can be effectively used is selection of the

non-relativistic case. Even for a very strong scattering potential, finite
amount of persistent current remains for a relativistic ring. In presence of
multiple scatterer we observe that the persistent current is maximum when the
scatterers are placed uniformly compared to the current averaged over random

the random averaged current increases with the number of scatterers. The latter

ever since the introduction of large scale genomic technologies which carried
the promise of elucidating the relationship in functional genomics. Microarray
technologies coupled with appropriate mathematical or statistical models have
made it possible to identify dynamic regulatory networks or to measure time
course of the expression level of many genes simultaneously. However one of the
few limitations fall on the high-dimensional nature of such data coupled with
the fact that these gene expression data are known to include some hidden
process. In that regards, we are concerned with deriving a method for inferring
a sparse dynamic network in a high dimensional data setting. We assume that the
observations are noisy measurements of gene expression in the form of mRNAs,
whose dynamics can be described by some unknown or hidden process. We build an
input-dependent linear state space model from these hidden states and
demonstrate how an incorporated $L_{1}$ regularization constraint in an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm can be used to reverse engineer
transcriptional networks from gene expression profiling data. This corresponds
to estimating the model interaction parameters. The proposed method is
illustrated on time-course microarray data obtained from a well established
T-cell data. At the optimum tuning parameters we found genes TRAF5, JUND, CDK4,
CASP4, CD69, and C3X1 to have higher number of inwards directed connections and
FYB, CCNA2, AKT1 and CASP8 to be genes with higher number of outwards directed
connections. We recommend these genes to be object for further investigation.
Caspase 4 is also found to activate the expression of JunD which in turn
represses the cell cycle regulator CDC2.

determine the abundances of hydrocarbon functional groups. Assuming that the
PAHs are mainly locked in grains, aliphatic CHx groups (x = 1,2,3) would
contribute approximately in equal quantities to the 3.4 mu-m feature (N_{CHx} /
N_{H} approx 10^{-5} - 2 * 10^{-5}). The abundances, however, may be two to
four times lower if a major contribution to the 3.4 mu-m feature comes from

some lines of sight, but can be nearly as abundant as each of the aliphatic
components in other directions (N_{=CH} / N_{H} < 2 * 10^{-5}; upper value for
grains). Due to comparatively low binding energies, astronomical IR emission
sources do not display such heavy excess hydrogenation. At best, especially in

covariance. Computing optimal experimental designs (OEDs) is particularly
challenging for inverse problems governed by computationally expensive PDE
models with infinite-dimensional (or, after discretization, high-dimensional)

structure and build a low-rank approximation of the parameter-to-observable
map, preconditioned with the square root of the prior covariance operator. This
relieves our method from expensive PDE solves when evaluating the optimal
experimental design objective function and its derivatives. Moreover, we employ
a randomized trace estimator for efficient evaluation of the OED objective
function. We control the sparsity of the sensor configuration by employing a
sequence of penalty functions that successively approximate the
$\ell_0$-""norm""; this results in binary designs that characterize optimal
sensor locations. We present numerical results for inference of the initial
condition from spatio-temporal observations in a time-dependent

optimal design can be computed at a cost, measured in number of forward PDE
solves, that is independent of the parameter and sensor dimensions. We
demonstrate numerically that $\ell_0$-sparsified experimental designs obtained
via a continuation method outperform $\ell_1$-sparsified designs.

More than 60 pulsation frequencies have been detected in its light curve as
observed by the Kepler satellite. We want to determine the fundamental stellar
and system parameters of the eclipsing binary as a precondition for
asteroseismic modelling of the pulsating component and to establish whether the
star is a semi-detached Algol-type system. We measured the radial velocities of
both components from new high-resolution spectra using TODCOR and compute the
orbit using PHOEBE. We used the KOREL program to decompose the observed spectra
into its components, and analysed the decomposed spectra to determine the
atmospheric parameters. For this, we developed a new computer program for the
normalisation of the KOREL output spectra. Fundamental stellar parameters are
determined by combining the spectroscopic results with those from the analysis
of the Kepler light curve. We obtain Teff, logg, vsini, and the absolute masses
and radii of the components, together with their flux ratio and separation.
Whereas the secondary star rotates synchronously with the orbital motion, the
primary star rotates subsynchronously by a factor of 0.75. The newly determined
mass ratio of 0.0911 is higher than previously thought and means a detached

long-studied problem of computational algebra with applications in mathematics,
engineering, computer science, and the natural sciences. For isolating as well
as for approximating all complex roots, the best algorithm known is based on an
almost optimal method for approximate polynomial factorization, introduced by
Pan in 2002. Pan's factorization algorithm goes back to the splitting circle
method from Schoenhage in 1982. The main drawbacks of Pan's method are that it
is quite involved and that all roots have to be computed at the same time. For
the important special case, where only the real roots have to be computed, much
simpler methods are used in practice; however, they considerably lag behind
Pan's method with respect to complexity.
  In this paper, we resolve this discrepancy by introducing a hybrid of the
Descartes method and Newton iteration, denoted ANEWDSC, which is simpler than
Pan's method, but achieves a run-time comparable to it. Our algorithm computes
isolating intervals for the real roots of any real square-free polynomial,
given by an oracle that provides arbitrary good approximations of the
polynomial's coefficients. ANEWDSC can also be used to only isolate the roots
in a given interval and to refine the isolating intervals to an arbitrary small
size; it achieves near optimal complexity for the latter task.

medium and the interstellar medium of the host galaxy. SDSS J080800.99+483807.7
has been serendipitously discovered in MERLIN 18 cm observations to be a
double-lobed radio galaxy. Because it is an optically faint source, basic
information like redshift, linear size, and structure has been incomplete until
now. Furthermore, there are no spectra of this source available in any
databases. The goal of this work is to derive the main physical properties of
SDSS J080800.99+483807.7 and study the possible interaction between the radio
jets and the interstellar medium of the host galaxy. To achieve this goal, we
used optical spectroscopy and radio interferometry. The radio data were
obtained with MERLIN at 18 cm and the optical data with the Multi-Object Double
Spectrograph (MODS) at the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). The redshift of the
galaxy is z = 0.2805 +/- 0.0003, resulting in a linear size of the observed
radio structure of ~ 26.3 kpc. The optical line emission as well as the
infrared and radio continuum emission suggest a high star-formation activity.
In addition, we estimated the mass of the central black hole to be log
(MBH/Msun) ~ 6.9. The MODS spectrum and the optical images from Sloan Digital
Sky Survey suggest that SDSS J080800.99+483807.7 is an elliptical host galaxy.
In combination with the overall radio structure, we argue that the star
formation could be the result of the back-flow along the jet and the
interstellar medium of the host.

candidate (H_\eta) contained in \eta transforms as a singlet in effective limit

contributions of different mutational sources to the total pool of genetic
variation in a species, and understanding how these different forms of genetic
variation interact with natural selection. Recent work has shown that
structural variants (insertions, deletions, inversions and transpositions) are
a major source of genetic variation, often out-numbering single nucleotide
variants in terms of total bases affected. Despite the near ubiquity of
structural variants, major questions about their interaction with natural
selection remain. For example, how does the allele frequency spectrum of
structural variants differ when compared to single nucleotide variants? How
often do structural variants affect genes, and what are the consequences? To
begin to address these questions, we have systematically identified and
characterized a large set submicroscopic insertion and deletion (indel)
variants (between 1 kb to 200 kb in length) among ten individuals from a single
natural population of the plant species Mimulus guttatus. After extensive
computational filtering, we focused on a set of 4,142 high-confidence indels
that showed an experimental validation rate of 73%. All but one of these indels
were < 200 kb. While the largest were generally at lower frequencies in the
population, a surprising number of large indels are at intermediate
frequencies. While indels overlapping with genes were much rarer than expected
by chance, nearly 600 genes were affected by an indel. NBS-LRR defense response
genes were the most enriched among the gene families affected. Most indels
associated with genes were rare and appeared to be under purifying selection,
though we do find four high-frequency derived insertion alleles that show
signatures of recent positive selection.

resources, and each player's strategy is pure and consists of a subset of the
resources on which it applies a fixed weight. Such games represent unsplittable
routing flow games and also job allocation games. The congestion of a resource
is the sum of the weights of the players that use it and the player's cost
function is the sum of the utilities of the resources on its strategy. The
social cost is the total weighted sum of the player's costs. The quality of
Nash equilibria is determined by the price of anarchy ($PoA$) which expresses
how much worse is the social outcome in the worst equilibrium versus the
optimal coordinated solution. In the literature the predominant work has only
been on games with polynomial utility costs, where it has been proven that the
price of anarchy is bounded by the degree of the polynomial. However, no
results exist on general bounds for non-polynomial utility functions.
  Here, we consider general versions of these games in which the utility of
each resource is an arbitrary non-decreasing function of the congestion. In
particular, we consider a large family of superpolynomial utility functions
which are asymptotically larger than any polynomial. We demonstrate that for
every such function there exist games for which the price of anarchy is
unbounded and increasing with the number of players (even if they have
infinitesimal weights) while network resources remain fixed. We give tight
lower and upper bounds which show this dependence on the number of players.
Furthermore we provide an exact characterization of the $PoA$ of all congestion
games whose utility costs are bounded above by a polynomial function.
Heretofore such results existed only for games with polynomial cost functions.

redbacks) can provide important information about accretion history, pulsar
irradiation of their companion stars and the evolutionary link between
accreting X-ray pulsars and isolated millisecond pulsars. However, the
formation of such systems is not well understood, nor the difference in
progenitor evolution between the two populations of black widows and redbacks.
Whereas both populations have orbital periods between $0.1-1.0\;{\rm days}$
their companion masses differ by an order of magnitude. In this paper, we
investigate the formation of these systems via evolution of converging low-mass
X-ray binaries by employing the MESA stellar evolution code. Our results
confirm that one can explain the formation of most of these eclipsing binary
millisecond pulsars using this scenario. More notably, we find that the
determining factor for producing either black widows or redbacks is the
efficiency of the irradiation process, such that the redbacks absorb a larger
fraction of the emitted spin-down energy of the radio pulsar (resulting in more
efficient mass loss via evaporation) compared to that of the black widow
systems. We argue that geometric effects (beaming) is responsible for the
strong bimodality of these two populations. Finally, we conclude that redback
systems do not evolve into black widow systems with time.

inclinations of individual AGN are unknown. We have developed a promising
technique for determining the inclinations of nearby AGN by mapping the
kinematics of their narrow-line regions (NLRs), which are often easily resolved
with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) [O III] imaging and long-slit spectra from
the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). Our studies indicate that NLR
kinematics dominated by radial outflow can be fit with simple biconical outflow
models that can be used to determine the inclination of the bicone axis, and
hence the obscuring torus, with respect to our line of sight. We present NLR
analysis of 53 Seyfert galaxies and resultant inclinations from models of 17
individual AGN with clear signatures of biconical outflow. Our model results
agree with the unified model in that Seyfert 1 AGN have NLRs inclined further
toward our line of sight (LOS) than Seyfert 2 AGN. Knowing the inclinations of
these AGN NLRs, and thus their accretion disk and/or torus axes, will allow us
to determine how their observed properties vary as a function of polar angle.
We find no correlation between the inclinations of the AGN NLRs and the disks
of their host galaxies, indicating that the orientation of the gas in the torus
is independent from that of the host disk.

redshift (0.3 < z < 2.5) using 3D-HST WFC3 grism spectroscopy and Spitzer
mid-infrared data. We select quiescent galaxies on the basis of the widely used
UVJ color-color criteria. Spectral energy distribution fitting (rest frame
optical and near-IR) indicates very low star formation rates for quiescent
galaxies (sSFR ~ 10^-12 yr^-1). However, SED fitting can miss star formation if
it is hidden behind high dust obscuration and ionizing radiation is re-emitted
in the mid-infrared. It is therefore fundamental to measure the dust-obscured
SFRs with a mid-IR indicator. We stack the MIPS-24um images of quiescent
objects in five redshift bins centered on z = 0.5, 0.9, 1.2, 1.7, 2.2 and
perform aperture photometry. Including direct 24um detections, we find sSFR ~
10^-11.9 * (1+z)^4 yr^-1. These values are higher than those indicated by SED
fitting, but at each redshift they are 20-40 times lower than those of typical
star forming galaxies. The true SFRs of quiescent galaxies might be even lower,
as we show that the mid-IR fluxes can be due to processes unrelated to ongoing
star formation, such as cirrus dust heated by old stellar populations and
circumstellar dust. Our measurements show that star formation quenching is very
efficient at every redshift. The measured SFR values are at z > 1.5 marginally
consistent with the ones expected from gas recycling (assuming that mass loss
from evolved stars refuels star formation) and well above that at lower
redshifts.

closest billion solar mass BH. Deep studies of the center revealed a very
underluminous active galactic nucleus (AGN) immersed in an old massive nuclear
star cluster. Recent $1$~Ms \textit{Chandra} X-ray visionary project
observations of the NGC3115 nucleus resolved hot tenuous gas, which fuels the
AGN. In this paper we connect the processes in the nuclear star cluster with
the feeding of the supermassive BH. We model the hot gas flow sustained by the
injection of matter and energy from the stars and supernova explosions. We
incorporate electron heat conduction as the small-scale feedback mechanism, the
gravitational pull of the stellar mass, cooling, and Coulomb collisions.
Fitting simulated X-ray emission to the spatially and spectrally resolved
observed data, we find the best-fitting solutions with $\chi^2/dof=1.00$ for
$dof=236$ both with and without conduction. The radial modeling favors a low BH
mass $<1.3\times10^{9}M_\odot$. The best-fitting supernova rate and the
best-fitting mass injection rate are consistent with their expected values. The
stagnation point is at $r_{\rm st}\lesssim1$arcsec, so that most of gas,
including the gas at a Bondi radius $r_B=2-4$arcsec, outflows from the region.
We put an upper limit on the accretion rate at $2\times10^{-3}M_\odot{\rm
yr}^{-1}$. We find a shallow density profile $n\propto r^{-\beta}$ with
$\beta\approx1$ over a large dynamic range. This density profile is determined
in the feeding region $0.5-10$arcsec as an interplay of four processes and
effects: (1) the radius-dependent mass injection, (2) the effect of the
galactic gravitational potential, (3) the accretion flow onset at
$r\lesssim1$arcsec, and (4) the outflow at $r\gtrsim1$arcsec. The gas
temperature is close to the virial temperature $T_v$ at any radius.

resource which should be used only when necessary. Given an n-qubit unitary U
we are interested in computing a circuit that implements it using the minimum
possible number of T gates (called the T-count of U). A related task is to
decide if the T-count of U is less than or equal to m; we consider this problem
as a function of N=2^n and m. We provide a classical algorithm which solves it
using time and space both upper bounded as O(N^m poly(m,N)). We implemented our

assumptions of the gas distribution; while TeV scale DM annihilating dominantly
to leptons has its tightest constraints from observations towards the galactic

new broadband radio observations; it is therefore vital that methods are
developed to handle this new type of data. In this paper, we present the
Broadband Radio Astronomy ToolS (BRATS) software package and, use it to carry
out detailed analysis of JVLA observations of three powerful radio galaxies. We
compare two of the most widely used models of spectral ageing, the
Kardashev-Pacholczyk and Jaffe-Perola models and also results of the more

Tribble model provides both a good fit to observations as well as providing a
physically realistic description of the source. We present the first

originally proposed in a classic series of papers by Sonett and collaborators.
As originally conceived, induction heating is caused by the ""motional electric
field"" which appears in the frame of an asteroid immersed in a fully-ionized,
magnetized solar wind and drives currents through its interior. However we
point out that classical induction heating contains a subtle conceptual error,
in consequence of which the electric field inside the asteroid was calculated
incorrectly. The problem is that the motional electric field used by Sonett et
al. is the electric field in the freely streaming plasma far from the asteroid;
in fact the motional field vanishes at the asteroid surface for realistic
assumptions about the plasma density. In this paper we revisit and improve the
induction heating scenario by: (1) correcting the conceptual error by self
consistently calculating the electric field in and around the boundary layer at
the asteroid-plasma interface; (2) considering weakly-ionized plasmas
consistent with current ideas about protoplanetary disks; and (3) considering
more realistic scenarios which do not require a fully ionized, powerful T Tauri
wind in the disk midplane. We present exemplary solutions for two highly
idealized flows which show that the interior electric field can either vanish
or be comparable to the fields predicted by classical induction depending on
the flow geometry. We term the heating driven by these flows ""electrodynamic
heating"", calculate its upper limits, and compare them to heating produced by
short-lived radionuclides.

Such patterns can provide possible evidence for the existence of central binary

viability of explaining the previously observed incomplete ring-like patterns
with the spiral-shell structure due to the motion of (unknown) binary
components viewed at an inclination with respect to the orbital plane. We
describe a method of extracting such spiral-shells from an incomplete ring-like
pattern to place constraints on the characteristics of the central binary
stars. The use of gas kinematics is essential in facilitating a detailed
modeling for the three-dimensional structure of the circumstellar pattern. We
show that a hydrodynamic radiative transfer model can reproduce the structure
of the HC3N molecular line emission of the extreme carbon star, CIT 6. This
method can be applied to other sources in the AGB phase and to the outer
ring-like patterns of pre-planetary nebulae for probing the existence of
embedded binary stars, which are highly anticipated with future observations

properties of the Lagrangian density field. We focus on a perturbation spectrum
with a small-scale cut-off (as in warm dark matter cosmologies). This cut-off
results in a strong suppression of low mass objects, providing additional
leverage to rigorously test which perturbations collapse and to what mass. We
find that all haloes are consistent with forming near peaks of the initial
density field, with a strong correlation between proto-halo density and
ellipticity. We demonstrate that, while standard excursion set theory with
correlated steps completely fails to reproduce the mass function, the inclusion
of the peaks constraint leads to the correct number of haloes but significantly
underpredicts the masses of low-mass objects (with the predicted halo mass
function at low masses behaving like dn/dln m ~ m^{2/3}). This prediction is
very robust and cannot be easily altered within the framework of a single
collapse barrier. The nature of collapse in the presence of a small-scale
cut-off thus reveals that excursion set calculations require a more detailed
understanding of the collapse-time of a general ellipsoidal perturbation to
predict the ultimate collapsed mass of a peak -- a problem that has been hidden
in the large abundance of small-scale structure in CDM. We demonstrate how this
problem can be resolved within the excursion set framework.

silhouette disk Orion 218-354 taken with Magellan AO (MagAO) and its visible
light camera, VisAO, in simultaneous differential imaging (SDI) mode at
H-alpha. This is the first image of a circumstellar disk seen in silhouette
with adaptive optics and is among the first visible light adaptive optics
results in the literature. We derive the disk extent, geometry, intensity and
extinction profiles and find, in contrast with previous work, that the disk is
likely optically-thin at H-alpha. Our data provide an estimate of the column
density in primitive, ISM-like grains as a function of radius in the disk. We
estimate that only ~10% of the total sub-mm derived disk mass lies in
primitive, unprocessed grains. We use our data, Monte Carlo radiative transfer
modeling and previous results from the literature to make the first
self-consistent multiwavelength model of Orion 218-354. We find that we are
able to reproduce the 1-1000micron SED with a ~2-540AU disk of the size,
geometry, small vs. large grain proportion and radial mass profile indicated by
our data. This inner radius is a factor of ~15 larger than the sublimation
radius of the disk, suggesting that it is likely cleared in the very interior.

an axisymmetric piecewise flat 3-dimensional geometry with 3-sphere topology.
SRF was recently introduced as an unstructured mesh formulation of Hamilton's
Ricci flow (RF). It describes the RF of a piecewise-flat simplicial geometry.
In this paper, we apply the SRF equations to a representative double-lobed
axisymmetric piecewise flat geometry with mirror symmetry at the neck similar
to the geometry studied by Angenent and Knopf (A-K). We choose a specific
radial profile and compare the SRF equations with the corresponding
finite-difference solution of the continuum A-K RF equations. The
piecewise-flat 3-geometries considered here are built of
isosceles-triangle-based frustum blocks. The axial symmetry of this model
allows us to use frustum blocks instead of tetrahedra. The 2-sphere
cross-sectional geometries in our model are regular icosahedra. We demonstrate
that, under a suitably-pinched initial geometry, the SRF equations for this
relatively low-resolution discrete geometry yield the canonical Type-1 neck
pinch singularity found in the corresponding continuum solution. We adaptively
remesh during the evolution to keep the circumcentric dual lattice
well-centered. Without such remeshing, we cannot evolve the discrete geometry
to neck pinch. We conclude with a discussion of future generalizations and
tests of this SRF model.

particularly important when observations are used to calibrate galaxy formation

motions of just ~0.2 mas/yr (~0.4 km/s at 414 pc) - this is a ~2-10x

on the area-averaged slip, the amplitude of the roughness, and on the fraction

inhibit the effective slip and enhance the anisotropy of the flow. Finally, we

range of temperatures in its disc atmosphere, consistent with thermo-chemical
disc models. In HAEBEs, the objects with CO detections all have flared discs in
which the gas and dust are thermally decoupled. We use a small model grid to
analyse our observations and find that an increased amount of flaring means
higher line flux, as it increases the mass in warm gas. CO is not detected in
our flat discs as the emission is below the detection limit. We find that HAEBE
sources with CO detections have high Luv and strong PAH emission, again
connected to the heating of the gas. In TTS, the objects with CO detections are
all sources with evidence for a disc wind or outflow. For both groups of
objects, sources with CO detections generally have high UV luminosity (either
stellar in HAEBEs or due to accretion in TTS), but this is not a sufficient
condition for the detection of the far-IR CO lines.

function, can be simplified by making use of time-dependent density-functional
theory. In this case, the optimal control equations require some modifications

with dustier H II regions, but part of the [C II] deficit may arise from an
additional mechanism, plausibly charged dust grains. This is consistent with
some of the [C II] originating from PDRs or the ISM. We derive relations
between far-IR line luminosities and both IR luminosity and star formation
rate. We find that [N II] and both [O I] lines are good tracers of IR
luminosity and star formation rate. In contrast, [C II] is a poor tracer of IR
luminosity and star formation rate, and does not improve as a tracer of either
quantity if the [C II] deficit is accounted for. The continuum luminosity
densities also correlate with IR luminosity and star formation rate. We derive
ranges for the gas density and ultraviolet radiation intensity of 10^1 < n <
10^2.5 and 10^2.2 < G_0 < 10^3.6, respectively. These ranges depend on optical
type, the importance of star formation, and merger stage. We do not find
relationships between far-IR line properties and several other parameters; AGN
activity, merger stage, mid-IR excitation, and SMBH mass. We conclude that
these far-IR lines arise from gas heated by starlight, and that they are not
strongly influenced by AGN activity.

lines that connect it to Jupiter's polar regions. The currents generate, and
modulate radio emissions along their paths via the electron-cyclotron maser
instability. Based on this process, we suggest that such modulation of
planetary radio emissions may reveal the presence of exomoons around giant
planets in exoplanetary systems. A model explaining the modulation mechanism in
the Jupiter-Io system is extrapolated, and used to define criteria for exomoon
detectability. A cautiously optimistic scenario of possible detection of such
exomoons around Epsilon Eridani b, and Gliese 876 b is provided.

symmetric and exterior algebras of Type 1 representations of $U_q(g)$ defined
by Berenstein and Zwicknagl. We define a notion of a commutative algebra object
in a coboundary category, and we prove that the quantum symmetric algebra of a
module is the universal commutative algebra generated by that module. That is,
the functor assigning to a module its quantum symmetric algebra is left adjoint
to a forgetful functor. We also prove a conjecture of Berenstein and Zwicknagl,
stating that the quantum symmetric and exterior cubes exhibit the same amount
of ""collapsing"" relative to their classical counterparts. We prove that those
quantum exterior algebras that are flat deformations of their classical
analogues are Frobenius algebras. We also develop a rigorous framework for
discussing continuity and limits of the structures involved as the deformation
parameter q varies along the positive real line.
  The second part deals with quantum analogues of Clifford algebras and their
application to the noncommutative geometry of certain quantum homogeneous
spaces. We introduce the quantum Clifford algebra through its spinor
representation via creation and annihilation operators on one of the flat
quantum exterior algebras discussed in the first part. The proof that the
spinor representation is irreducible relies on the Frobenius property discussed
previously. We use this quantum Clifford algebra to revisit Krahmer's
construction of a Dolbeault-Dirac-type operator on a quantized irreducible flag
manifold. This operator is of the form $d+d^*$, and we relate $d$ to the
boundary operator for the Koszul complex of a certain quantum symmetric
algebra, which shows that $d^2=0$. This is a first step toward a
Parthasarathy-type formula for the spectrum of the square of the Dirac
operator.

as a possible site for a detonation triggered by a thermonuclear runaway. In
this paper, we find the minimum helium layer thickness that will sustain a
steady laterally propagating detonation and show that it depends on the density
and composition of the helium layer, specifically C12 and O16. Detonations in
these thin helium layers have speeds slower than the Chapman-Jouget (CJ) speed
from complete helium burning, v_cj=1.5e9 cm/s. Though gravitationally unbound,
the ashes still have unburned helium (~ 80% in the thinnest cases) and only
reach up to heavy elements such as Ca40, Ti44, Cr48, and Fe52. It is rare for
these thin shells to generate large amounts of Ni56. We also find a new set of
solutions that can propagate in even thinner helium layers when O16 is present
at a minimum mass fraction of ~0.07. Driven by energy release from alpha
captures on O16 and subsequent elements, these slow detonations only create
ashes up to Si28 in the outer detonated He shell. We close by discussing how
the unbound helium burning ashes may create faint and fast "".Ia"" supernovae as
well as events with virtually no radioactivity, and speculate on how the slower
helium detonation velocities impact the off-center ignition of a carbon
detonation that could cause a Type Ia supernova in the double detonation
scenario.

primary are ubiquitous in astrophysics. The phenomenology of such
Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretors is particularly rich when an accretion
disc forms around the secondary. The outer radius of such discs is commonly
estimated from the net angular momentum produced by a density variation of
material across the BHL or Bondi accretion cylinder, as the latter is tilted
with respect to the direction to the primary due to orbital motion. But this
approach has ignored the fact that the wind experiences an outward driving
force that the secondary does not. In actuality, the accretion stream falls
toward a retarded point in the secondary's orbit as the secondary is pulled
toward the primary relative to the stream. The result is a finite separation or
""accretion stream impact parameter"" (ASIP) separating the secondary and stream.
When the orbital radius a_o exceeds the BHL radius r_b, the ratio of outer disc
radius estimated as the ASIP to the conventional estimate
a_o^{1/2}/r_b^{1/2}>1. We therefore predict that discs will form at larger
radii from the secondary than traditional estimates. This agrees with the
importance of the ASIP emphasized by Huarte-Espinosa et al. (2013) and the
practical consequence that resolving the initial outer radius of such an
accretion disc in numerical simulations can be less demanding than what earlier
estimates would suggest.

key idea is to exploit an implicit rank constraint, originated from a

mass dark matter haloes. Here we make use of high resolution re-simulations of
rich clusters and their surroundings from the Phoenix Project and a large
volume cosmological simulation, the Millennium-II run, to quantify assembly
bias effects on dwarf-sized dark matter haloes. We find that, in the regions
around massive clusters, dwarf-sized haloes ($[10^9,10^{11}]\ms$) form earlier
($\Delta z \sim 2$ in redshift) and possess larger $V_{\rm max}$ ($\sim20%$)
than the field galaxies. We find that this environmental dependence is largely
caused by tidal interactions between the ejected haloes and their former hosts,
while other large scale effects are less important. Finally we assess the
effects of assembly bias on dwarf galaxy formation with a sophisticated
semi-analytical galaxy formation model. We find that the dwarf galaxies near
massive clusters tend to be redder ($\Delta(u-r) = 0.5$) and have three times
as much stellar mass compared to the field galaxies with the same halo mass.
These features should be seen with observational data.

strength is on the order of the cavity decay rate, a cavity mode with at most a
single-excitation present gives rise to sub-Poissonian oscillator limit-cycles
that generate quantum features in the steady state just above the renormalized
cavity resonance frequency and mechanical sidebands. The merger of multiple
stable limit-cycles markedly reduces these nonclassical signatures. Varying the
cavity-resonator coupling strength, corresponding to the micromaser pump

so-called sharp trace and sharp determinant of the GTO, with the former being
the Witten index, which is also the stochastic generalization of the Lefschetz
index so that it equals the Euler characteristic of the (closed) phase space

possibility to apply the spectral theorems of the DS theory to the
Fokker-Planck operators allows to extend the previous picture of the
spontaneous topological supersymmetry (Q-symmetry) breaking onto the situations
with negative ground state's attenuation rate. The later signifies the
exponential growth of the number of periodic solutions/orbits in the large time
limit, which is the unique feature of chaotic behavior proving that the
spontaneous breakdown of Q-symmetry is indeed the field-theoretic definition
and stochastic generalization of the concept of deterministic chaos. In
addition, the previously proposed low-temperature classification of SDEs, i.e.,
thermodynamic equilibrium / noise-induced chaos ((anti)instanton condensation,
intermittent) / ordinary chaos (non-integrability of the flow vector field), is
complemented by the discussion of the high-temperature regime where the sharp
boundary between the noise-induced and ordinary chaotic phases must smear out
into a crossover, and at even higher temperatures the Q-symmetry is restored.
The Weyl quantization is discussed in the context of the Ito-Stratonovich

entanglement $E(M)$ between two macroscopic objects by way of model studies.
Knowing that a macroscopic object is a composite, how does one determine $E(M)$
in terms of the entanglements between its micro-constituents $E(\mu)$? We
assert that the notion of `levels of structure', the coupling strength between
constituents in different levels, and the use of collective variables in each
level are all pertinent factors. We consider two types of coupling, each
constituent particle is coupled to only one other particle (1-to-1) versus it
coupled to all particles (1-to-all). In the 1-1 case with pairwise interactions
of equal strength, the entanglement is independent of the number of constituent
particles $N$ in the macroscopic object. In the 1-to-all case the relative
coordinates are decoupled and the center of mass (CoM) coupling scales with
$N$. We provide a proof of the conditions whereby the CoM variable decouples, a
cause for the special role the CoM variable plays in the entanglement between
the two such macroscopic objects. This qualitative behavior is largely not
affected by fluctuations in the interaction strength. We also analyzed the
entanglement pattern of 4 coupled oscillators in two pairs, representing the
two objects A and B (or two adjacent levels of structure), each with two
constituents. By assigning different coupling strengths we can investigate the
interplay of inter-level entanglement with intra- level interactions. From the
entanglement dynamics of the 4-oscillator system with varying coupling strength
we see the entanglement between constituents meeting sudden death while the CoM
variables may sustain over longer times. This offers another way to determine
under what conditions quantum entanglement between macroscopic objects can
persist.

displays a surprising array of unusual properties, also known as water
anomalies, the most famous being the density maximum at about $4^\circ$C. The
origin of these anomalies is still a matter of debate, and so far a
quantitative description of water's phase behavior starting from the molecular
arrangements is still missing. Here we provide a simple physical description
from microscopic data obtained through computer simulations. We introduce a
novel structural order parameter, which quantifies the degree of translational
order of the second shell, and show that this parameter alone, which measures
the amount of locally favored structures, accurately characterizes the state of
water. A two-state modeling of these microscopic structures is used to describe
the behavior of liquid water over a wide region of the phase diagram, correctly
identifying the density and compressibility anomalies, and being compatible
with the existence of a second critical point in the deeply supercooled region.
Furthermore, we reveal that locally favored structures in water not only have
translational order in the second shell, but also contain five-membered rings
of hydrogen-bonded molecules. This suggests their mixed character: the former
helps crystallization, whereas the latter causes frustration against
crystallization.

the electron-phonon collision integrals. The widely used two temperature model
follows from the theory as the limiting case, when the thermalization due to
the electronelectron collisions is fast with respect to the electron-phonon
relaxation. It is demonstrated that the energy relaxation has two consecutive
processes. The first and most important step describes the emission of phonons
by the photo-excited electrons. It leads to the relaxation of 90% of the energy
before the electrons become thermalized among themselves. The second step
describes electronphonon thermalization and may be described by the two
temperature model. The second stage is difficult to observe experimentally
because it involves the transfer of only a small amount of energy from
electrons. Thus the theory explains why the divergence of the relaxation time
at low temperatures was never observed experimentally.

violate classical inequalities in general, except for a special state-dependent
noncontextuality. However, we show that fourth-order correlations can violate

spin helix standing wave similar to the Persistent Spin Helix which exists in
the two-dimensional electron gas with equal Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit
interactions. These results may be useful both for spin-based experimental
determination of the Luttinger parameters of the valence band Hamiltonian and

various authors extended Roth's result to lower bounds also for the
$\mathcal{L}_q$ discrepancy and for infinite sequences. While it was known
already from the early 1980s on that Roth's lower bound is best possible in the
order of magnitude, it was a longstanding open question to find explicit
constructions of point sets and sequences with optimal order of $\mathcal{L}_2$

implemented by one and two-state automata. We calculate the payoff matrix of
all pairwise encounters in the presence of noise. We explore deterministic
selection dynamics with and without mutation. Using different error rates and
payoff values, we observe convergence to a small number of distinct equilibria.
Two of them are uncooperative strict Nash equilibria representing always-defect
(ALLD) and Grim. The third equilibrium is mixed and represents a cooperative
alliance of several strategies, dominated by a strategy which we call Forgiver.
Forgiver cooperates whenever the opponent has cooperated; it defects once when
the opponent has defected, but subsequently Forgiver attempts to re-establish
cooperation even if the opponent has defected again. Forgiver is not an
evolutionarily stable strategy, but the alliance, which it rules, is
asymptotically stable. For a wide range of parameter values the most commonly
observed outcome is convergence to the mixed equilibrium, dominated by
Forgiver. Our results show that although forgiving might incur a short-term
loss it can lead to a long-term gain. Forgiveness facilitates stable
cooperation in the presence of exploitation and noise.

processing and digital communication systems via sampled-data H-infinity
control theory. The difference between our method and conventional ones is in
the signal spaces. Conventional designs are executed in the discrete-time
domain, while our design takes account of both the discrete-time and the
continuous-time signals. Namely, our method can take account of the
characteristic of the original analog signal and the influence of the A/D and
D/A conversion. While the conventional method often indicates that an ideal
digital low-pass filter is preferred, we show that the optimal solution need
not be an ideal low-pass when the original analog signal is not completely
band-limited. This fact can not be recognized only in the discrete-time domain.
Moreover, we consider quantization effects. We discuss the stability and the
performance of quantized sampled-data control systems. We justify H-infinity
control to reduce distortion caused by the quantizer. Then we apply it to
differential pulse code modulation. While the conventional Delta modulator is
not optimal and besides not stable, our modulator is stable and optimal with
respect to the H-infinity-norm. We also give an LMI (Linear Matrix Inequality)
solution to the optimal H-infinity approximation of IIR (Infinite Impulse
Response) filters via FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filters. A comparison with
the Nehari shuffle is made with a numerical example, and it is observed that
the LMI solution generally performs better. Another numerical study also
indicates that there is a trade-off between the pass-band and stop-band
approximation characteristics.

two-dimensional lattices with real-valued quenched disorder on the lattice
edges are studied. Here, the disorder allows for negative edge-weights. In
previous studies, considering the negative-weight percolation (NWP) problem,
this was shown to change the universality class of the existing, static
percolation transition. In the presented study, four different types of BGRWs
and an algorithm based on the ant colony optimization (ACO) heuristic were
considered. Regarding the BGRWs, the precise configurations of the lattice
walks constructed during the numerical simulations were influenced by two
parameters: a disorder parameter rho that controls the amount of negative edge
weights on the lattice and a bias strength B that governs the drift of the
walkers along a certain lattice direction. Here, the pivotal observable is the
probability that, after termination, a lattice walk exhibits a total negative
weight, which is here considered as percolating. The behavior of this
observable as function of rho for different bias strengths B is put under

increases from zero to one. This is the key feature of the percolation

low-ionisation nuclear emission line region (LINER). For 30 years this was
attributed to a central mass-accreting supermassive black hole (AGN) of low
luminosity, making LINER galaxies the largest AGN-sub-population, dominating in
numbers over higher luminosity Seyfert galaxies and quasars. This, however,
poses a serious problem. While the inferred energy balance is plausible, many
LINERs clearly do not contain any other independent signatures of an AGN. Using
integral field spectroscopic data from the CALIFA survey, we aim at comparing
the observed radial surface brightness profiles with what is expected from
illumination by an AGN. Essential for this analysis is a proper extraction of
emission-lines, especially weak lines such as the Balmer Hb line which is
superposed on an absorption trough. To accomplish this, we use the GANDALF code
which simultaneously fits the underlying stellar continuum and emission lines.
We show for 48 galaxies with LINER-like emission, that the radial emission-line
surface brightness profiles are inconsistent with ionisation by a central
point-source and hence cannot be due to an AGN alone. The most probable
explanation for the excess LINER-like emission is ionisation by evolved stars
during the short but very hot and energetic phase known as post-AGB. This leads
us to an entirely new interpretation. Post-AGB stars are ubiquitous and their
ionising effect should be potentially observable in every galaxy with gas
present and stars older than ~1 Gyr, unless a stronger radiation field from
young hot stars or an AGN outshines them. This means that galaxies with
LINER-like emission are in fact not a class defined by a property, but rather
by the absence of a property. It also explains why LINER emission is observed
mostly in massive galaxies with old stars and little star formation.

based on Birkhoff-von-Neumann (BvN) decomposition; the performance of the BvN
switch becomes less predictable when the input traffic is bursty. In this
paper, we propose a deflection-compensated BvN (D-BvN) switch architecture to
enhance the quasi-static scheduling based on BvN decomposition. The D-BvN
switches provide capacity guarantee for virtual circuits (VCs) and deflect
bursty traffic when overflow occurs. The deflection scheme is devised to offset
the excessive buffer requirement of each VC when input traffic is bursty. The
design of our conditional deflection mechanism is based on the fact that it is
unlikely that the traffic input to VCs is all bursty at the same time; most
likely some starving VCs have spare capacities when some other VCs are in the
overflow state. The proposed algorithm makes full use of the spare capacities
of those starving VCs to deflect the overflow traffic to other inputs and
provide bandwidth for the deflected traffic to re-access the desired VC. Our
analysis and simulation show that this deflection-compensated mechanism can
support BvN switches to achieve close to 100% throughput of offered load even
with bursty input traffic, and reduces the average end-to-end delay and delay
jitter. Also, our result indicates that the packet out-of-sequence probability
due to deflection of overflow traffic is negligible, thus only a small
re-sequencing buffer is needed at each output port.

known population (the SMC luminous components or the Milky Way disc, to which
we broadly refer to as ""self lensing"") or to the would be population of dark
matter compact halo objects (MACHOs). To this purpose, we present profiles of
the optical depth and, comparing to the observed quantities, we carry out
analyses of the events position and duration. Finally, we evaluate and study
the microlensing rate. Overall, we consider five reported microlensing events
towards the SMC (one by EROS and four by OGLE). The analysis shows that in
terms of number of events the expected self lensing signal may indeed explain
the observed rate. However, the characteristics of the events, spatial
distribution and duration (and for one event, the projected velocity) rather
suggest a non-self lensing origin for a few of them. In particular we evaluate,
through a likelihood analysis, the resulting upper limit for the halo mass
fraction in form of MACHOs given the expected self-lensing and MACHO lensing
signal. At 95% CL, the tighter upper limit, about 10%, is found for MACHO mass
of $10^{-2} \mathrm{M}_\odot$, upper limit that reduces to above 20% for $0.5

young stellar objects in the N band (8-13 micron). We had successful fringe
detections for 20 objects, and present spectrally-resolved correlated fluxes
and visibility levels for projected baselines of up to 128 m. We fit the
visibilities with geometric models to derive the sizes of the emitting regions,
as well as the orientation and elongation of the circumstellar material.
Fourteen objects in the sample show the 10 micron silicate feature in
absorption in the total and correlated flux spectra. For 13 of these objects,
we were able to fit the correlated flux spectra with a simple absorption model,
allowing us to constrain the composition and absorptive properties of the
circumstellar material. Nearly all of the massive young stellar objects
observed show significant deviations from spherical symmetry at mid-infrared
wavelengths. In general, the mid-infrared emission can trace both disks and
outflows, and in many cases it may be difficult to disentangle these components
on the basis of interferometric data alone, because of the sparse spatial
frequency coverage normally provided by current long-baseline interferometers.
For the majority of the objects in this sample, the absorption occurs on
spatial scales larger than those probed by MIDI. Finally, the physical extent
of the mid-infrared emission around these sources is correlated with the total
luminosity, albeit with significant scatter.

In the zero-error regime, the optimal rates of source codes and channel codes
are given by graph parameters known as the Witsenhausen rate and Shannon
capacity, respectively. The Lov\'asz theta number, a graph parameter defined by
a semidefinite program, gives the best efficiently-computable upper bound on

General approaches that clarify this relationship and allow for more efficient

I demonstrate the utility of expressing the governing equations of arbitrary
first-order dynamical systems (interaction networks) in terms of sums of real
functions (generalized reactions) multiplied by real scalars (generalized
stoichiometries). Specifically, I examine the mathematical notion of influence
topology, which is based on the reaction stoichiometries and the first
derivatives of the reactions with respect to each species at the steady state
solution(s). It is naturally represented as a signed directed bipartite graph
with arrows or blunt arrows connecting a species node to a reaction node
(positive/negative derivative) or a reaction node to a species node
(positive/negative stoichiometry). The set of all such graphs is denumerable. A
significant reduction in dimensionality is possible through stoichiometric
scaling, cycle compaction, and temporal scaling. All cycles in a network can be
read directly from the graph of its influence topology, enabling efficient and
intuitive computation of the principal minors (sums of products of
non-overlapping bipartite cycles) and the Hurwitz determinants (sums of
products of either the principal minors or the bipartite cycles) for testing
steady state stability. The stability of a given network is shown to have a
hierarchical dependence first on its influence topology and then, more
specifically, on algebraic conditions (exact functional form of the reactions).
The utility of this hierarchical approach to bifurcation analysis is
demonstrated on classical networks from control theory, biology, chemistry,
physics, and electronics.

continuous transformation from the first to the second drawing such that

  In this paper, we improve upon such results, by showing an algorithm to morph
any two planar straight-line drawings of a planar graph in O(n^2) steps;

Regularization via Generalized Fourier Series (e.g., Discrete Cosine Functions,
Gram Polynomials, Haar Functions, etc.), Tikhonov Regularization, Constrained
Regularization by imposing boundary conditions, and regularization via Weighted
Least Squares can all be solved expediently in the context of the Sylvester

sparse matrix methods, which are no better than $\mathcal{O}!(n^6)$ algorithms

faster than the state-of-the-art; we therefore present, for the first time,

optical processes and is well within the expertise of most optical
laboratories. It is well understood and characterised, both theoretically and
experimentally. We show that it can be a source of continuous variable
asymmetric Gaussian harmonic steering with fields which have a coherent
excitation, hence combining the important effects of harmonic entanglement and
asymmetric steering in one easily controllable device, adjustable by the simple
means of tuning the cavity loss rates at the fundamental and harmonic
frequencies. We find that whether quantum steering is available via the
standard measurements of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlations can depend on
which quadrature measurements are inferred from output spectral measurements of
the fundamental and the harmonic. Altering the ratios of the cavity loss rates
can be used to tune the regions where symmetric steering is available, with the
results becoming asymmetric over all frequencies as the cavity damping at the
fundamental frequency becomes significantly greater than at the harmonic.
  This asymmetry and its functional dependence on frequency is a potential new
tool for experimental quantum information science, with possible utility for
quantum key distribution. Although we show the effect here for Gaussian
measurements of the quadratures, and cannot rule out a return of the steering
symmetry for some class of non-Gaussian measurements, we note here that the
system obeys Gaussian statistics in the operating regime investigated and
Gaussian inference is at least as accurate as any other method for calculating
the necessary correlations. Perhaps most importantly, this system is simpler
than any other methods we are aware of which have been used or proposed to
create asymmetric steering.

significantly influenced by the absence or presence of lateral diffusion of the
adsorbed particles. When diffusion is present, the adsorbate configuration is
simultaneously changed by two distinct processes, proceeding in parallel:
adsorption/desorption, which changes the total adsorbate coverage, and lateral
diffusion, which is coverage conserving. Inspired by experimental results, we
here study the effects of these competing processes by kinetic Monte Carlo
simulations of a simple lattice-gas model. In order to untangle the various
effects, we perform large-scale simulations, in which we monitor coverage,
correlation length, and cluster-size distributions, as well as the behavior of
representative individual clusters, during desorption. For each initial
adsorbate configuration, we perform multiple, independent simulations, without
and with diffusion, respectively. We find that, compared to desorption without
diffusion, the coverage-conserving diffusion process produces two competing
effects: a retardation of the desorption rate, which is associated with a
coarsening of the adsorbate configuration, and an acceleration due to
desorption of monomers ""evaporated"" from the cluster perimeters. The balance
between these two effects is governed by the structure of the adsorbate layer
at the beginning of the desorption process. Deceleration and coarsening are
predominant for configurations dominated by monomers and small clusters, while
acceleration is predominant for configurations dominated by large clusters.

Furthermore, all susceptibilities are found to be largely suppressed by

vector repulsion of baryon resonances restrains fluctuations to a region
determined in lattice QCD. However, in the quark sector above $T_c$ even small

the Sgr dSph core: namely that it is dominated by a population between [Fe/H] ~
-1 dex and solar, with a significant [alpha/Fe] versus [Fe/H] gradient. While
strong contamination from the Galactic Bulge prevents accurate measurement of
the (Galactic) north side of the Sgr dSph, the dwarf galaxy can be
well-approximated by a roughly ovaloid projection of characteristic size 4 x 2
degrees, beyond which the projected stellar density is less than half that of
the region surrounding the core. The galaxy's major axis is perpendicular to
the Galactic Plane, as in previous studies. We find slight evidence to confirm
a metallicity gradient in the Sgr dSph and use isochrones to fit a distance of
24.3 +/- 2.3 kpc. We were unable to fully constrain the metallicity
distribution of the Sgr dSph due to the Bulge contamination and strong
correlation of [alpha/Fe] with metallicity, however we find that metal-poor
stars ([Fe/H] <~ --1) make up <~29 per cent of the Sgr dSph's upper-RGB
population. The Bulge population is best fit by a younger population with
[Fe/H] ~ 0 and [alpha/Fe] ~ 0 or slightly higher. We find no evidence for a

with a soft thermal component with a temperature of ~0.22 keV (using a disc
model) and a hard, non-thermal component with a photon index of ~1.6 when using
a simple power-law model. In addition, an edge at ~ 0.73 keV is needed likely
due to interstellar absorption. During the first RXTE observation we find a 6
mHz quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) which is not present during any of the
later RXTE observations or during the XMM-Newton observation which was taken 3
days after the first RXTE observation. The nature of this QPO is not clear but
it could be related to a similar QPO seen in the black hole system H 1743-322
and to the so-called 1 Hz QPO seen in the dipping neutron-star X-ray binaries
(although this later identification is quite speculative). The observed QPO has
similar frequencies as the optical dips seen previously in this source during
its 2011 outburst but we cannot conclusively determine that they are due to the
same underlying physical mechanism. Besides the QPO, we detect strong
band-limited noise in the power-density spectra of the source (as calculated
from both the RXTE and the XMM-Newton data) with characteristic frequencies and
strengths very similar to other black hole X-ray transients when they are at
low X-ray luminosities. We discuss the spectral and timing properties of the
source in the context of the proposed very high inclination of this source. We
conclude that all the phenomena seen from the source cannot, as yet, be

charge and critical exponents agree well with the results of the $1-n$
perturbative expansion. Furthermore, for $n> n_c$, we find a line of
multicritical FPs at strong randomness. The FP at $n=1$ has $c=0.4612(4)$,
which suggests that it belongs to the universality class of the Nishimori point
in the $\pm J$ random-bond Ising model. For $n>2$, we find another critical
line that connects the hard-hexagon FP in the pure model to a finite-randomness
zero-temperature FP.

phenomena. Prominent among these is the fractionalisation of electrons into
unusual particles: Majorana fermions [1], Laughlin quasiparticles [2] or
magnetic monopoles [3]. Their detection, however, is fundamentally complicated
by the lack of any local order, such as, for example, the magnetisation in a
ferromagnet. While there are now several instances of candidate topological
spin liquids [4], their identification remains challenging [5]. Here, we
provide a complete and exact theoretical study of the dynamical structure
factor of a two-dimensional quantum spin liquid in gapless and gapped phases.
We show that there are direct signatures - qualitative and quantitative - of
the Majorana fermions and gauge fluxes emerging in Kitaev's honeycomb model.
These include counterintuitive manifestations of quantum number
fractionalisation, such as a neutron scattering response with a gap even in the
presence of gapless excitations, and a sharp component despite the
fractionalisation of electron spin. Our analysis identifies new varieties of
the venerable X-ray edge problem and explores connections to the physics of
quantum quenches.

technique is applied to intensity Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data with
homogeneous regions using the Gamma model. The first approach uses a
Nagao-Matsuyama-type procedure for setting the overlapping samples, and the
second uses the nonlocal method. The proposals are compared with the Improved
Sigma filter and with anisotropic diffusion for speckled data (SRAD) using a
protocol based on Monte Carlo simulation. Among the criteria used to quantify
the quality of filters, we employ the equivalent number of looks, and line and
edge preservation. Moreover, we also assessed the filters by the Universal
Image Quality Index and by the Pearson correlation between edges. Applications
to real images are also discussed. The proposed methods show good results.

complexes via ultrafast spectroscopy, opening exciting possibilities for the
study and design of coherent exciton transport. Yet, ambiguity in the
spectroscopic signals has led to arguments for interpreting them in terms of
the exciton dynamics, demanding more stringent tests. We propose a novel
strategy, Quantum Process Tomography (QPT) for ultrafast spectroscopy, to
reconstruct the evolving quantum state of excitons in double-walled
supramolecular light-harvesting nanotubes at room temperature. The protocol
calls for eight transient grating experiments with varied pulse spectra. Our
analysis reveals unidirectional energy transfer from the outer to the inner
wall excitons, absence of nonsecular processes, and an unexpected coherence
between those two states lasting about 150 femtoseconds, indicating weak
electronic coupling between the walls. Our work constitutes the first
experimental QPT in a 'warm' and complex system, and provides an elegant scheme
to maximize information from ultrafast spectroscopy experiments.

spatial spread of epidemics. In this paper we study the impact of inter-patch
connection weights on the predictions of these models. We contrast arbitrary,
uniform link weights with link weights predicted using a gravity model based on
patch populations and distance. In a synthetic system with one large driver
city and many small follower cities, we show that under uniform link weights,
epidemics in the follower regions are perfectly synchronized. In contrast,
gravity-based links allow a more realistic, less synchronized distribution of
epidemic peaks in the follower regions. We then fit a three-patch
metapopulation model to regional dengue fever data from Peru -- a country
experiencing yearly, spatially defined epidemics. We use data for 2002-2008
(studying the seasonal disease patterns in the country and the yearly
reinfection patterns from jungle to the coast) and 2000-2001 (one large
epidemic of a new disease strain across the country). We present numerical
results.

Authenticity ratings amongst viewers were significantly positively correlated.
Ratings between viewers and performers were not significant but all positive. A
higher correlation between ratings of both authenticity and skill of

larger region $Y$, in which the sensors are distributed by a Poisson process of
density $\lambda$ to detect this event region, i.e., its boundary. The model of
sensor is a 0-1 sensor that decides whether it lies in $X$ or not, and which
might be incorrect with probability $p$. It also collects information on the
0-1 values of the neighbors within some distance $r$ and revises its decision
by the majority vote of these neighbors. In the most general setting, we
analyze this simple majority vote scheme and derive some upper and lower bounds
on the expected number of misclassified sensors. These bounds depend on several
sensing parameters of $p$, $r$, and some geometric parameters of the event
region $X$. By making some assumptions on the shape of $X$, we prove a
significantly improved upper bound on the expected number of misclassified
sensors; especially for convex regions with sufficiently round boundary, and we
find that the majority vote scheme performs well in the simulation rather than
its theoretical upper bound.

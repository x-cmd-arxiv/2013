been developed over the last few years, and have been demonstrated to provide
powerful probes of quantum dynamics in different types of molecular aggregates,
including both natural and artificial light harvesting complexes. Fourier
transform-based spectroscopies have been particularly successful, yet
'complete' spectral information normally necessitates the loss of all
information on the temporal sequence of events in a signal. This information
though is particularly important in transient or multi-stage processes, in
which the spectral decomposition of the data evolves in time. By going through
several examples of ultrafast quantum dynamics, we demonstrate that the use of
wavelets provide an efficient and accurate way to simultaneously acquire both
temporal and frequency information about a signal, and argue that this greatly
aids the elucidation and interpretation of physical process responsible for
non-stationary spectroscopic features, such as those encountered in coherent
excitonic energy transport.

textures such as domain walls. Since superconductors are easy-plane
ferromagnets in particle-hole (charge) space, it is natural to ask whether any
charge duals of STT phenomena exist therein. We find that the superconducting
analogue of the adiabatic STT vanishes in a bulk superconductor with a
momentum-independent order parameter, while the superconducting counterpart of
the nonadiabatic STT does not vanish. This nonvanishing superconducting torque
is induced by heat (rather than charge) currents and acts on the charge (rather
than spin) degree of freedom. It can become significant in the vicinity of the
superconducting transition temperature, where it generates a net quasiparticle
charge and alters the dispersion and linewidth of low-frequency collective

to neutrino emission. Comparing modified stellar evolution sequences with
observations provides some of the most restrictive limits on axions and other
hypothetical low-mass particles and on non-standard neutrino properties. In
particular, a putative neutrino magnetic dipole moment mu_nu enhances the
plasmon decay process, postpones helium ignition in low-mass stars, and
therefore extends the red-giant branch (RGB) in globular clusters (GCs). The
brightness of the tip of the RGB (TRGB) remains the most sensitive probe for
mu_nu and we revisit this argument from a modern perspective. Based on a large
set of archival observations, we provide high-precision photometry for the
Galactic GC M5 (NGC5904) and carefully determine its TRGB position. On the
theoretical side, we add the extra plasmon decay rate brought about by mu_nu to
the Princeton-Goddard-PUC stellar evolution code. Different sources of
uncertainty are critically examined. The main source of systematic uncertainty
is the bolometric correction and the main statistical uncertainty derives from
the distance modulus based on main-sequence fitting. (Other measures of
distance, e.g., the brightness of RR Lyrae stars, are influenced by the energy
loss that we wish to constrain.) The statistical uncertainty of the TRGB
position relative to the brightest RGB star is less important because the RGB
is well populated. We infer an absolute I-band brightness of M_I=-4.17+/-0.13
mag for the TRGB compared with the theoretical prediction of -3.99+/-0.07 mag,
in reasonable agreement with each other. A significant brightness increase
caused by neutrino dipole moments is constrained such that
mu_nu<2.6x10^-12mu_B(68% CL), where mu_B is the Bohr magneton, and
mu_nu<4.5x10^-12 mu_B(95% CL). In these results, statistical and systematic

We developed an advanced model of the large-scale wind-velocity and
wind-density structure with 3-D radiative transfer calculations that fit the
orbitally modulated P Cyg profile of He I lam5876, showing outflow velocities
above 1000 km/s. We find that MWC 314 is a massive semi-detached binary system
of ~1.22 AU, observed at an inclination angle of i=72.8 deg. with an orbital
period of 60.8 d and e=0.23. The primary star is a low-vsini LBV candidate of
m1=39.6 Msun and R1=86.8 Rsun. The detailed radiative transfer fits show that
the geometry of wind density is asymmetric around the primary star with
increased wind density by a factor of 3.3, which leads the orbit of the
primary. The variable orientation causes the orbital modulation that is
observed in absorption portions of P Cyg wind lines. Wind accretion in the
system produces a circumbinary disc. MWC 314 is in a crucial evolutionary phase
of close binary systems, when the massive primary star has its H envelope being
stripped and is losing mass to a circumbinary disc. MWC 314 is a key system for
studying the evolutionary consequences of these effects.

an extension of the SM consisting of the addition of one vector-like quark

the goal is to find parameters of a numerical model, e.g.~a partial
differential equation (PDE), such that the output of the numerical model is
compatible with (noisy) data. We use the Bayesian approach to parameter
estimation, in which a posterior probability density describes the probability
of the parameter conditioned on data and compute an empirical estimate of this
posterior with implicit sampling. Our approach generates independent samples,
so that some of the practical difficulties one encounters with Markov Chain
Monte Carlo methods, e.g.~burn-in time or correlations among dependent samples,
are avoided. We describe a new implementation of implicit sampling for
parameter estimation problems that makes use of multiple grids (coarse to fine)
and BFGS optimization coupled to adjoint equations for the required gradient
calculations. The implementation is ""dimension independent"", in the sense that
a well-defined finite dimensional subspace is sampled as the mesh used for
discretization of the PDE is refined. We illustrate the algorithm with an
example where we estimate a diffusion coefficient in an elliptic equation from
sparse and noisy pressure measurements. In the example, dimension\slash
mesh-independence is achieved via Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve expansions.

arguments seem to indicate that stellar mass black holes (BH) persist in
stellar systems such as globular star clusters for much longer than previously
thought. Previously, theory implied that the BH would segregate into a compact
system with short dynamical time scales, and that the BH would escape long
before the present. But stellar systems can exist in a state of balanced
evolution, where the energy generated in the core is regulated by the process
of two-body relaxation in the bulk of the system. If the system has a centrally
concentrated BH subsystem and there is no massive central BH, then the energy
is generated by three-body encounters in the core of this subsystem. Therefore,
in balanced evolution, the evolution of the BH subsystem is regulated by the
much longer time scales of the host system. In the present paper the
implications of these results for idealized nuclear star clusters (NSC) are
discussed. Though previous theory implied that BH would be almost absent from
many NSC -- those with relatively short dynamical time scales -- it is argued
here that, based on the results of idealized models, many such NSC could still
be host to substantial BH subsystems.

Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA survey alpha.40 data release allows us, for the first
time, to study the HI properties of over 740 galaxy groups in the volume of sky
common to the SDSS and ALFALFA surveys. We assigned ALFALFA HI detections a
group membership based on an existing magnitude/volume-limited SDSS DR7
group/cluster catalog. Additionally, we assigned group ""proximity"" membership
to HI detected objects whose optical counterpart falls below the limiting
optical magnitude--thereby not contributing substantially to the estimate of
the group stellar mass, but significantly to the total group HI mass. We find
that only 25% of the HI detected galaxies reside in groups or clusters, in
contrast to approximately half of all optically detected galaxies. Further, we
plot the relative positions of optical and HI detections in groups as a
function of parent dark matter halo mass to reveal strong evidence that HI is
being processed in galaxies as a result of the group environment: as optical
membership increases, groups become increasingly deficient of HI rich galaxies
at their center and the HI distribution of galaxies in the most massive groups
starts to resemble the distribution observed in comparatively more extreme
cluster environments. We find that the lowest HI mass objects lose their gas
first as they are processed in the group environment, and it is evident that
the infall of gas rich objects is important to the continuing growth of large
scale structure at the present epoch, replenishing the neutral gas supply of
groups. Finally, we compare our results to those of cosmological simulations

occupation distribution for both low and high mass halos.

grid codes, to investigate the properties of solenoidal and dilatational
motions of the intergalactic medium (IGM), and the impact of numerical
viscosity on turbulence in a LCDM universe. The codes differ only in the
spatial difference discretization. We find that (1) The vortical motion grows
rapidly since $z=2$, and reaches $\sim 10 km/s -90 km/s$ at $z=0$. Meanwhile,
the small-scale compressive ratio $r_{CS}$ drops from 0.84 to 0.47, indicating
comparable vortical and compressive motions at present. (2) Power spectra of
the solenoidal velocity possess two regimes, $\propto k^{-0.89}$ and $\propto
k^{-2.02}$, while the total and dilatational velocity follow the scaling
$k^{-1.88}$ and $k^{-2.20}$ respectively in the turbulent range. The IGM
turbulence may contain two distinct phases, the supersonic and post-supersonic
phases. (3) The non-thermal pressure support, measured by the vortical kinetic
energy, is comparable with the thermal pressure for $\rho_b \simeq 10-100$, or
$T <10^{5.5} K$ at $z=0.0$. The deviation of the baryon fraction from the
cosmic mean shows a preliminary positive correlation with the turbulence
pressure support. (4) A relatively higher numerical viscosity would dissipate
both the compressive and vortical motions of the IGM into thermal energy more
effectively, resulting in less developed vorticity, remarkably shortened
inertial range, and leading to non-negligible uncertainty in the thermal
history of gas accretion. Shocks in regions outside of clusters are
significantly suppressed by numerical viscosity since $z=2$, which may directly
cause the different levels of turbulence between two codes.

for carbon-oxygen cores of the same mass and chemical stratification leads to
less energetic PISN explosions that produce smaller amounts of Ni-56 due to the
effect of the angular momentum barrier that develops and slows the dynamical
collapse. We find a non-monotonic dependence of Ni-56 production on rotational

potential can be fully utilised only if galaxy shapes are measured with great
accuracy. Two major effects have been identified which are likely to account
for most of the bias for maximum likelihood methods in recent shear measurement
challenges. Model bias occurs when the true galaxy shape is not well
represented by the fitted model. Noise bias occurs due to the non-linear
relationship between image pixels and galaxy shape. In this paper we
investigate the potential interplay between these two effects when an imperfect
model is used in the presence of high noise. We present analytical expressions
for this bias, which depends on the residual difference between the model and
real data. They can lead to biases not accounted for in previous calibration
schemes. By measuring the model bias, noise bias and their interaction, we
provide a complete statistical framework for measuring galaxy shapes with model
fitting methods from GRavitational lEnsing Accuracy Testing (GREAT) like
images. We demonstrate the noise and model interaction bias using a simple toy
model, which indicates that this effect can potentially be significant. Using
real galaxy images from the Cosmological Evolution Survey (COSMOS) we quantify
the strength of the model bias, noise bias and their interaction. We find that
the interaction term is often a similar size to the model bias term, and is
smaller than the requirements of the current and shortly upcoming galaxy
surveys.

observed, but may be critical for MHD dynamos. Coriolis forces from
differential rotation (DR) play a large role in determining what the meridional
circulation is. Here we consider whether a stellar DR that is constant on
cylinders concentric with the rotation axis can drive a meridional
circulation.Conventional wisdom says that it can not. Using two related forms
of governing equations that respectively estimate the longitudinal components
of the curl of meridional mass flux and the vorticity, we show that such DR
will drive a meridional flow. This is because to satisfy anelastic mass
conservation, non-spherically symmetric pressure contours must be present for
all DRs, not just ones that depart from constancy on cylinders concentric with
the rotation axis. Therefore the fluid is always baroclinic if DR is present,
because, in anelastic systems, the perturbation pressure must satisfy a Poisson
type equation, as well as an equation of state and a thermodynamic equation. We
support our qualitative reasoning with numerical examples, and show that
meridional circulation is sensitive to the magnitude and form of departures
from rotation constant on cylinders. The effect should be present in 3D global
anelastic convection simulations, particularly those for which the DR driven by
global convection is nearly cylindrical in profile. For solar-like DR, Coriolis
forces generally drive a two-celled circulation in each hemisphere, with a
second, reversed flow at high latitudes. For solar like turbulent viscosities,
the meridional circulation produced by Coriolis forces is much larger than
observed on the Sun. Therefore there must be at least one additional force,
probably a buoyancy force, which opposes the meridional flow to bring its
amplitude down to observed values.

because it is similar to the ""low/hard"" state seen in other black holes,
especially in that compact, steady jets are launched in this phase. The 3-79
keV bandpass of NuSTAR, and its ability to obtain moderate-resolution spectra
free from distortions such as photon pile-up, are extremely well suited to
studies of disk reflection in X-ray binaries. In only 15 ks of net exposure, an
extraordinarily sensitive spectrum of GRS 1915+105 was measured across the full
bandpass. Ionized reflection from a disk around a rapidly-spinning black hole
is clearly required to fit the spectra; even hybrid Comptonization models
including ionized reflection from a disk around a Schwarzschild black hole
proved inadequate. A spin parameter of a = 0.98 +/- 0.01 (1-sigma statistical
error) is measured via the best-fit model; low spins are ruled out at a high
level of confidence. This result suggests that jets can be launched from a disk
extending to the innermost stable circular orbit. A very steep inner disk
emissivity profile is also measured, consistent with models of compact coronae
above Kerr black holes. These results support an emerging association between
the hard X-ray corona and the base of the relativistic jet.

guards in a polygonal region P, such that all points in P are guarded. The
problem is known to be NP-hard, and its inherent continuous structure (with
both the set of points that need to be guarded and the set of points that can
be used for guarding being uncountably infinite) makes it difficult to apply a
straightforward formulation as an Integer Linear Program. We use an iterative
primal-dual relaxation approach for solving AGP instances to optimality. At
each stage, a pair of LP relaxations for a finite candidate subset of primal
covering and dual packing constraints and variables is considered; these
correspond to possible guard positions and points that are to be guarded.
  Particularly useful are cutting planes for eliminating fractional solutions.
We identify two classes of facets, based on Edge Cover and Set Cover (SC)
inequalities. Solving the separation problem for the latter is NP-complete, but
exploiting the underlying geometric structure, we show that large subclasses of
fractional SC solutions cannot occur for the AGP. This allows us to separate
the relevant subset of facets in polynomial time. We also characterize all
facets for finite AGP relaxations with coefficients in {0, 1, 2}.
  Finally, we demonstrate the practical usefulness of our approach. Our cutting
plane technique yields a significant improvement in terms of speed and solution
quality due to considerably reduced integrality gaps as compared to the
approach by Kr\""oller et al.

localized as the midgap states for the thiol-radical-ligated complex, which
altered the absorption spectrum of bare Cd6Se6 by inducing a new lower energy

galaxies and its evolution with cosmic time. Using the Spitzer-IRAC data in the
COSMOS field, we estimate the contribution from hot-dust at rest-frame 4.2um
(from ~0 < z < ~0.2 up to ~0.5 < z < ~0.9). This wavelength corresponds to
black-body temperature of ~690K. The contribution due to stellar emission is
estimated from the rest-frame 1.6um luminosity (assumed to result from stellar
emission alone) and subtracted from the mid-infrared luminosity of galaxies to
measure hot-dust emission. In order to attempt the study of the 3.3um-PAH
feature, we use the rest-frame 4.2um to infer the hot-dust flux at 3.3um. This
study is performed for different spectral types of galaxies: early-type,
late-type, starburst, and IR-selected AGN. We find that: (a) the decrease of
the hot-dust luminosity density since ~0.5 < z < ~1 is steeper (by at least
~0.5dex) compared to that of the cold-dust, giving support to the scenario
where galaxy obscuration increases with redshift, as already proposed in the
literature; (b) hot-dust and PAH emission evolution seems to be correlated with
stellar mass, where rest-frame 1.6um luminous non-AGN galaxies (i.e., massive
systems) show a stronger decrement (with decreasing redshift) in hot-dust and
PAH emission than the less luminous (less massive) non-AGN galaxies; (c)
despite comprising < ~3% of the total sample, AGN contribute as much as a third
to the hot-dust luminosity density at z < 1 and clearly dominate the bright-end
of the total hot-dust Luminosity Density Function at ~0.5 < z < ~0.9; (d) the
average dust-to-total luminosity ratio increases with redshift, while
PAH-to-total luminosity ratio remains fairly constant; (e) at M_1.6 > -25, the
dust-to-total and PAH-to-total luminosity ratios increase with decreasing
luminosity, but deeper data is required to confirm this result.

equations of motion in the Einstein frame and hence the absence of Ostrogradski
ghost degrees of freedom. The existence of a mapping to the Jordan frame is not
trivial in the general case, and can be addressed using the Jacobian of the
frame transformation through its eigenvalues and eigentensors. These objects
also appear in the study of different aspects of such theories, including the
metric and field redefinition transformation of the path integral in the
quantum mechanical description. Although sane in the Einstein frame, generic
disformally coupled theories are described by higher order equations of motion
in the Jordan frame. This apparent contradiction is solved by the use of a
hidden constraint: the contraction of the metric equations with a Jacobian
eigentensor provides a constraint relation for the higher field derivatives,
which allows one to express the dynamical equations in a second order form.
This signals a loophole in Horndeski's theorem and allows one to enlarge the
set of scalar-tensor theories which are Ostrogradski-stable. The transformed
Gauss-Bonnet terms are also discussed for the simplest conformal and disformal

terms of current ideas about orbital migration and eccentricity damping due to
planet-disk interactions. Our primary focus is on mean motion resonances. Only
a few percent of planet pairs are in close proximity to a resonance. However,
predicted migration rates (parameterized by $\tau_n=n/{|\dot n|}$) imply that
during convergent migration most planets would have been captured into first
order resonances. Eccentricity damping (parameterized by $\tau_e=e/{|\dot e|}$)
offers a plausible resolution. Estimates suggest $\tau_e/\tau_n\sim (h/a)^2\sim
10^{-2}$, where $h/a$ is the ratio of disk thickness to radius. Together,
eccentricity damping and orbital migration give rise to an equilibrium
eccentricity, $e_{eq}\sim(\tau_e/\tau_n)^{1/2}$. Capture is permanent provided
$e_{eq}\lesssim \mu^{1/3}$, where $\mu$ denotes the planet to star mass ratio.
But for $e_{eq}\gtrsim \mu^{1/3}$, capture is only temporary because librations
around equilibrium are overstable and lead to passage through resonance on
timescale $\tau_e$. Most Kepler planet pairs have $e_{eq}>\mu^{1/3}$. Since
$\tau_n>> \tau_e$ is the timescale for migration between neighboring
resonances, only a modest percentage of pairs end up trapped in resonances
after the disk disappears. Planet pairs close to a mean motion resonance
typically exhibit period ratios 1-2% larger than those for exact resonance. The
direction of this shift undoubtedly reflects the same asymmetry that requires
convergent migration for resonance capture. Permanent resonance capture at
these separations from exact resonance would demand $\mu
(\tau_n/\tau_e)^{1/2}\gtrsim 0.01$, a value that estimates of $\mu$ from
transit data and $(\tau_e/\tau_n)^{1/2}$ from theory are insufficient to match.
Plausible alternatives involve eccentricity damping during or after disk
dispersal. (Abridged)

underdoped cuprate (in either the strange metal or pseudogap regime) in contact
with either an overdoped cuprate or a standard Fermi liquid can be used
diagnose how different the pseudogap and strange metals are from a Fermi
liquid. Naively one expects the strange metal to be more different from a Fermi
liquid than is the pseudogap. We compute the expected non-equilibrium transport
signal with the three Green functions that are available in the literature: 1)
marginal Fermi liquid theory, 2) the phenomenological ansatz for the pseudogap
regime and 3) the Wilsonian reduction of the Hubbard model which contains both
the strange metal and pseudogap. All three give linear IV curves at low bias
voltages. Significant deviations from linearity at higher voltages obtain only
in the marginal Fermi liquid approach. The key finding, however, is that IV
curves for the strange metal/Fermi liquid contact that exceed that of the
pseudogap/Fermi liquid system. If this is borne out experimentally, this
implies that the strange metal is less orthogonal to a Fermi liquid than is the
pseudogap. Within the Wilsonian reduction of the Hubbard model, this result is
explained in terms of a composite-particle picture. Namely, the pseudogap
corresponds to a confinement transition of the charge degrees of freedom
present in the strange metal. In the strange metal the composite excitations
break up and electron quasiparticles scatter off bosons. The bosons here,
however, do not arise from phonons but from the charge degrees of freedom
responsible for dynamical spectral weight transfer.

starburst ring, plus a less dense central molecular component, which is more
optically thin. We compare our molecular abundances with several well studied
galaxies, and with Galactic regions, in order to determine the primary driver
of the chemistry in Arp 157. We highlight some significant differences between
the abundances of molecules in this source and in the more extreme
ultra-luminous infrared galaxy Arp 220. This suggests that different physical
mechanisms may become important in driving gas chemistry at different points in
the evolution of a merger induced starburst. Of the nearby galaxies we
considered, NGC 253 (whose nuclear chemistry is dominated by large-scale
shocks) and NGC 1068 (whose nuclear chemistry is X-ray dominated) have the most
similar molecular abundances to Arp 157. The Galactic region Sgr B2(OH) (where
shock desorption of ices is thought to be important) may also have similar

follow a power-law with distance with an exponent given by the adiabatic

algebraically with an exponent understood within the sudden quench
approximation. This long distance regime is separated from an intermediate
distance one by a generalized Lieb-Robinson criterion. At long times, in this
intermediate regime, bosonization predicts that single-particle correlations
decay following a stretched exponential. This latter regime is unconventional

temperature range at various pressures of a torsion pendulum setup used to
study 3He confined in a 98% open silica aerogel. Values for Q^{-1} above T_c
are temperature independent and have a weak pressure dependence. Below T_c, a
deliberate axial compression of the aerogel by 10% widens the range of
metastability for a superfluid Equal Spin Pairing (ESP) state; we observe this
ESP phase on cooling and the B phase on warming over an extended temperature
region. While the dissipation for the B phase tends to zero as T goes to 0,
Q^{-1} exhibits a peak value greater than that at T_c at intermediate
temperatures. Values for Q^{-1} in the ESP phase are consistently higher than
in the B phase and are proportional to \rho_s/\rho until the ESP to B phase
transition is attained. We apply a viscoelastic collision-drag model, which
couples the motion of the helium and the aerogel through a frictional
relaxation time \tau_f. Our dissipation data is not sensitive to the damping
due to the presumed small but non-zero value of \tau_f. The result is that an
additional mechanism to dissipate energy not captured in the collision-drag
model and related to the emergence of the superfluid order must exist. The
extra dissipation below T_c is possibly associated with mutual friction between
the superfluid phases and the clamped normal fluid. The pressure dependence of
the measured dissipation in both superfluid phases is likely related to the
pressure dependence of the gap structure of the ""dirty"" superfluid. The large
dissipation in the ESP state is consistent with the phase being the A or the
Polar with the order parameter nodes oriented in the plane of the cell and
perpendicular to the aerogel anisotropy axis.

quantified using angular clustering amplitudes (Bgq) derived from deep optical
imaging data. Based on these comparisons, we discuss the role of the
environment in the triggering of powerful radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars.
When we compare the Bgq distributions of the type-2 quasars and quiescent
early-type galaxies, we find no significant difference between them. This is
consistent with the radio-quiet quasar phase being a short-lived but ubiquitous
stage in the formation of all massive early-type galaxies. On the other hand,
PRGs are in denser environments than the quiescent population, and this
difference between distributions of Bgq is significant at the 3 sigma level.
This result supports a physical origin of radio loudness, with high density gas
environments favouring the transformation of AGN power into radio luminosity,
or alternatively, affecting the properties of the supermassive black holes
themselves. Finally, focussing on the radio-loud sources only, we find that the
clustering of weak-line radio galaxies (WLRGs) is higher than the strong-line
radio galaxies (SLRGs), constituting a 3 sigma result. 82% of the 2Jy WLRGs are
in clusters, according to our definition (Bgq > 400) versus only 31% of the

a star's surface correlates physically with surface gravity; if brightness
variations on timescales of hours arise from granulation, then such variations
should correlate with surface gravity. Here we report an analysis of archival

highly dispersive mode in superconducting NCCO that is undetected in the
hole-doped compounds, which emanates from the zone center with a characteristic
energy comparable to the pseudogap, and may signal a quantum phase distinct

The combination of change in unit cell shape, long range of elastic distortion,
and flow of latent heat leads to large energy barriers resulting in domain
structure, hysteresis, and cracking. The situation is still worse near a triple
point where more than two phases are involved. The famous metal-insulator
transition (MIT) in vanadium dioxide, a popular candidate for ultrafast optical
and electrical switching applications, is a case in point. Even though VO2 is
one of the simplest strongly correlated materials, experimental difficulties
posed by the first-order nature of the MIT as well as the involvement of at
least two competing insulating phases have led to persistent controversy about
its nature. Here, we show that studying single-crystal VO2 nanobeams in a
purpose-built nanomechanical strain apparatus allows investigation of this
prototypical phase transition with unprecedented control and precision. Our
results include the striking finding that the triple point of the metallic and
two insulating phases is at the transition temperature, T_tr = T_c, which we
determine to be 65.0 +- 0.1 C. The findings have profound implications for the
mechanism of the MIT in VO2, but in addition they demonstrate the importance of
such an approach for mastering phase transitions in many other strongly

Lett. {\bf 110}, 046604 (2013)], it is shown that, by applying a moderate
magnetic field, and adjusting the gate potential of each quantum dot, opposing
spin polarizations are created in each channel. Furthermore, through a well
defined change in the gate potentials, the polarizations can be reversed. This
polarization effect is clearly associated to a spin-orbital Kondo state having
a Kondo peak that originates from spatially separated parts of the device. This
fact opens the exciting possibility of experimentally probing the internal
structure of an SU(2) Kondo state.

stars, and gas components, and (2) explore the effects of the halo MAHs on the
stellar/baryonic assembly of the simulated dwarfs and on their z~0 properties.
Overall, the simulated dwarfs are roughly consistent with observations. Our
main results are: a) The stellar-to-halo mass ratio is ~0.01 and remains
roughly constant since z~1 (the stellar MAHs follow closely the halo MAHs),
with a smaller value at higher z's for those halos that assemble their mass
later. b) The evolution of the galaxy gas fraction, fg, is episodic and higher,
most of the time, than the stellar fraction. When fg decreases (increases), the
gas fraction in the halo typically increases (decreases), showing that the SN
driven outflows play an important role in regulating the gas fractions -and
hence the SFR- of the dwarfs. However, in most cases, an important fraction of
the gas escapes the virial radius, Rv; at z=4 the total baryon fraction inside
Rv is 1.5-2 times smaller than the universal one, while at z=0 is 2-6 times
smaller, with the earlier assembled halos ejecting more gas. c) The SF
histories are episodic with changes in the SFRs of factors 2-10 on average. d)
Although the dwarfs formed in late assembled halos show more extended SF
histories, their z~0 SFRs are still below the ones measured for local isolated
dwarfs. e) The effects of baryons on Mv are such that at almost any time Mv is
10-20% smaller than the corresponding Mv obtained in pure N-body simulations.
Our results suggest that rather than increasing the strength of the SN-driven
outflows, processes that reduce the SF efficiency even more will help to solve
the potential issues faced by the CDM-based simulations of dwarfs.

simple graphs $G$ with $im(G) = m(G)$. We say that a finite connected simple
graph $G$ is a Cameron-Walker graph if $im(G) = m(G)$ and if $G$ is neither a
star nor a star triangle. In the present paper, we study Cameron-Walker graphs
from a viewpoint of commutative algebra. First, we prove that a Cameron-Walker
graph $G$ is unmixed if and only if $G$ is Cohen-Macaulay and classify all
Cohen-Macaulay Cameron-Walker graphs. Second, we prove that there is no

wavelengths, much lower than in the X-ray (~95%) or optical (~70%) bands. The
cause of this low radio detection rate has previously been attributed to
limited observing sensitivity. We use visibility stacking to test this idea,
and conclude that the low detection rate is instead due to two intrinsically
different populations of GRBs, radio bright and radio faint. We calculate that
no more than 70% of GRB afterglows are truly radio bright, leaving a
significant population of GRBs that lack a radio afterglow. These radio bright
GRBs have higher gamma-ray fluence, isotropic energies, X-ray fluxes and
optical fluxes than the radio faint GRBs, confirming the existence of two
physically distinct populations. We suggest that the gamma-ray efficiency of
the prompt emission is responsible for the difference between the two
populations. We also discuss the implications for future radio and optical

is exploited to measure how ICI is effectively coordinated. To achieve a
distributed power allocation scheme for each base station (BS), the throughput
contribution of each BS to the network is first given based on a pricing
mechanism. Different from existing works, a biobjective problem is formulated
based on multi-objective optimization theory, which aims at maximizing the
throughput contribution of the BS to the network and minimizing its total power
consumption at the same time. Using the method of Pascoletti and Serafini
scalarization, the relationship between the varying parameters and minimal
solutions is revealed. Furthermore, to exploit the relationship an algorithm is
proposed based on which all the solutions on the boundary of the efficient set
can be achieved by adaptively adjusting the involved parameters. With the
obtained solution set, the decision maker has more choices on power allocation
schemes in terms of both energy consumption and throughput. Finally, the
performance of the algorithm is assessed by the simulation results.

smooth curves (defined as a scalar distance $r$ from a fixed origin $O$)

direction of the surface normal may only depend on the curvature $\kappa$.
Under the assumption that only generic saddle-node bifurcations occur, we show
that $N(t)$ will decrease if the partial derivative $v_{\kappa}$ is positive
and increase if it is negative (Theorem 1). Justification for the genericity
assumption is provided in Section 5. For surfaces embedded in 3D, the normal
speed $v$ under curvature-driven flows may only depend on the principal
curvatures $\kappa, \lambda$. Here we prove the weaker (stochastic) Theorem 2

approximated by random variables with zero expected value and covariance.
Theorem 2 is a generalization of a result by Kuijper and Florack for the heat
equation. We formulate a Conjecture for the case when the reference point
coincides with the centre of gravity and we motivate the Conjecture by
intermediate results and an example. Since models for collisional abrasion are
governed by partial differential equations with $v_{\kappa},v_{\lambda}>0$, our
results suggest that the decrease of the number of static equilibrium points is

Previous explanations have focused on the adaptive limits of combinatorial
communication, or on its purported cognitive difficulties, but neither of these
explains the full distribution of combinatorial communication in the natural
world. Here we present a nonlinear dynamical model of the emergence of
combinatorial communication that, unlike previous models, considers how
initially non-communicative behaviour evolves to take on a communicative
function. We derive three basic principles about the emergence of combinatorial
communication. We hence show that the interdependence of signals and responses
places significant constraints on the historical pathways by which
combinatorial signals might emerge, to the extent that anything other than the
most simple form of combinatorial communication is extremely unlikely. We also
argue that these constraints can be bypassed if individuals have the
socio-cognitive capacity to engage in ostensive communication. Humans, but
probably no other species, have this ability. This may explain why language,
which is massively combinatorial, is such an extreme exception to nature's
general trend for non-combinatorial communication.

radio emission found in pulsar surveys with the Parkes Multi-beam Receiver. Not
much is known about the progenitors of these bursts, but they are
highly-energetic, and probably of extragalactic origin. Their properties
suggest extreme environments and interesting physics, but in order to
understand and study these events, more examples need to be found. Fortunately,
the recent boom in radio astronomy means many 'next-generation' radio
telescopes are set to begin observing in the near future. In this paper we
discuss the prospects of detecting short extragalactic bursts, in both
beamformed and imaging data, using these instruments. We find that often the
volume of space probed by radio surveys of fast transients is limited by the
dispersion measure (DM) of the source, rather than its physical distance
(although the two quantities are related). This effect is larger for
low-frequency telescopes, where propagation effects are more prominent, but,
their larger fields-of-view are often enough to compensate for this. Our
simulations suggest that the low-frequency component of SKA1 could find an
extragalactic burst every hour. We also show that if the sensitivity of the
telescope is above a certain threshold, imaging surveys may prove more fruitful
than beamformed surveys in finding these sorts of transients.

species are mutually beneficial. They are important examples of cooperation
shaped by evolution. Mutualism between animals and plants plays a key role in
the organization of ecological communities. Such networks in ecology have
generically evolved a nested architecture independent of species composition
and latitude - specialists interact with proper subsets of the nodes with whom
generalists interact. Despite sustained efforts to explain observed network
structure on the basis of community-level stability or persistence, such
correlative studies have reached minimal consensus. Here we demonstrate that
nested interaction networks could emerge as a consequence of an optimization
principle aimed at maximizing the species abundance in mutualistic communities.
Using analytical and numerical approaches, we show that because of the
mutualistic interactions, an increase in abundance of a given species results
in a corresponding increase in the total number of individuals in the
community, as also the nestedness of the interaction matrix. Indeed, the
species abundances and the nestedness of the interaction matrix are correlated
by an amount that depends on the strength of the mutualistic interactions.
Nestedness and the observed spontaneous emergence of generalist and specialist
species occur for several dynamical implementations of the variational
principle under stationary conditions. Optimized networks, while remaining
stable, tend to be less resilient than their counterparts with randomly
assigned interactions. In particular, we analytically show that the abundance
of the rarest species is directly linked to the resilience of the community.
Our work provides a unifying framework for studying the emergent structural and
dynamical properties of ecological mutualistic networks.

Furthermore, using an appropriate test function, we prove an upper bound for
the interaction energy, which is sharp to leading order. For the upper bound,
our assumptions are weaker, the remainder estimates stronger and the proof is

  Convolutional Codes from Short Codes",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A construction of big convolutional codes from short codes called block
Markov superposition transmission (BMST) is proposed. The BMST is very similar
to superposition blockMarkov encoding (SBME), which has been widely used to
prove multiuser coding theorems. The encoding process of BMST can be as fast as
that of the involved short code, while the decoding process can be implemented
as an iterative sliding-window decoding algorithm with a tunable delay. More
importantly, the performance of BMST can be simply lower-bounded in terms of
the transmission memory given that the performance of the short code is
available. Numerical results show that, 1) the lower bounds can be matched with
a moderate decoding delay in the low bit-error-rate (BER) region, implying that
the iterative slidingwindow decoding algorithm is near optimal; 2) BMST with
repetition codes and single parity-check codes can approach the Shannon limit
within 0.5 dB at BER of 10^{-5} for a wide range of code rates; and 3) BMST can
also be applied to nonlinear codes.

differ qualitatively in their chemical bonding picture. We find, that both
types induce localized interface bands near the symmetry line K-M in the
Brillouin zone and a related peak in the local density of states (LDOS) very
close to the Fermi energy, which should give rise to a dominating contribution
of the interface bands to the local conductivity at the stacking faults. In
contrast, a clean surface does not host any surface bands in the energy range
of the pi and sigma bands, and the LDOS near the surface is even depleted. On
the other hand, displacement of even one single surface layer induces a surface
band near K-M. A special role play p_z-bonded dimers (directed perpendicular to
the layers) in the vicinity of one type of stacking faults. They produce a
half-filled pair of interface states / interface resonances. The formation
energy of both types of stacking faults and the surface energy are estimated.

shown a downward trend. The decline has been weaker in the March maximum than
in the September minimum and masked by inter-annual fluctuations. One of the
less understood aspects of the sea ice response is the persistence times for
fluctuations, which could indicate the dominant physical processes behind the
sea ice decline. To determine the fluctuation persistence times, however, it is
necessary to first filter out the dominant effect of the seasonal cycle. In the
current study, we thus develop a statistical model, which accurately decomposes
the ice area changes into: (1) a variable seasonal cycle component with a
constant shape and (2) a residual (short term) fluctuation.
  We find the persistence time of fluctuations to be only about three weeks,
independently from season, which is substantially shorter than previously
reported. Such short time scale points to the dominance of atmospheric forcing.
The shape of the seasonal cycle is surprisingly constant for the whole
observational record despite the rapid decline. This is in agreement with the
suggestion that the asymmetry of the seasonal cycle is an effect of Arctic
land-sea geography, which has not changed with climate change.
  The analysis suggest a jump in the annual sea ice area amplitude occurring in
2007, from which it has not yet recovered, possibly revealing a permanent
amplitude shift. In physical sense, this could imply a shift towards the
younger, thinner and more susceptible ice cover commencing after the immense
2007 multi-year ice loss.

in relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) revealed a decrease in placebo annualized
relapse rates (ARR) over the past two decades. Furthermore, regression to the
mean effects were observed in ARR and MRI lesion counts. It is unclear whether
disease progression measured by the expanded disability status scale (EDSS)
exhibits similar features.
  Methods: A systematic review of RCTs in RMS was conducted extracting data on
EDSS and baseline characteristics. The logarithmic odds of disease progression
were modelled to investigate time trends. Random-effects models were used to
account for between-study variability; all investigated models included trial
duration as a predictor to correct for unequal study durations.
Meta-regressions were conducted to assess the prognostic value of a number of
baseline variables.
  Results: The systematic literature search identified 39 studies, including a
total of 19,714 patients. The proportion of patients in placebo controls
experiencing a disease progression decreased over the years (p<0.001). Meta
regression identified associated covariates including the size of the study and
its duration that in part explained the time trend. Progression probabilities
tended to be lower in the second year compared to the first year with a
reduction of 24% in progression probability from year 1 to year 2 (p=0.014).
  Conclusion: EDSS disease progression exhibits similar behaviour over time as
the ARR and point to changes in trial characteristics over the years,
questioning comparisons between historical and recent trials.

perturb this effective action, producing measurable changes to the classical

appear to be robust for pre- and post-selected ensembles, and why they can also
be measured using classical field techniques that are not weak for individual

one also means that a new physical theory can be obtained from a known one. One
of the procedures that allow to do so is called expansion of Lie algebras, and
has been recently used in different physical applications - particularly in
gauge theories of gravity. Here we report on further developments of this
method, required to understand in a deeper way their consequences in physical
theories. We have found theorems related to the preservation of some properties
of the algebras under expansions that can be used as criteria and, more
specifically, as necessary conditions to know if two arbitrary Lie algebras can
be related by the some expansion mechanism. Formal aspects, such as the Cartan

three-dimensional delayed detonation models for thermonuclear explosions of
near-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs (WDs). Here, we present multi-dimensional
radiative transfer simulations that provide synthetic light curves and spectra
for those models. The model sequence explores both changes in the strength of
the deflagration phase (controlled by the ignition configuration) and the WD
central density. In agreement with previous studies, we find that the strength
of the deflagration significantly affects the explosion and the observables.
Variations in the central density also have an influence on both brightness and
colour, but overall it is a secondary parameter in our set of models. In many
respects, the models yield a good match to normal Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia):
peak brightness, rise/decline time scales and synthetic spectra are all in
reasonable agreement. There are, however, several differences. In particular,
the models are too red around maximum light, manifest spectral line velocities
that are a little too high and yield I-band light curves that do not match
observations. Although some of these discrepancies may simply relate to
approximations made in the modelling, some pose real challenges to the models.
If viewed as a complete sequence, our models do not reproduce the observed
light-curve width-luminosity relation (WLR) of SNe Ia: all our models show
similar B-band decline rates, irrespective of peak brightness. This suggests
that simple variations in the strength of the deflagration phase in
Chandrasekhar-mass deflagration-to-detonation models do not readily explain the
observed diversity of normal SNe Ia. This may imply that some other parameter
within the Chandrasekhar-mass paradigm is key to the WLR, or that a substantial
fraction of normal SNe Ia arise from an alternative explosion scenario.

medias are shifting from printed to digital editions, accessing these huge
information sources is drawing increasingly more attention from national and
international institutions, as well as from the research community. These
collections are intrinsically big, leading to index files that do not fit into
the memory and an increase query response time. Decreasing the index size is a
direct way to decrease this query response time.
  Static index pruning methods reduce the size of indexes by removing a part of
the postings. In the context of web archives, it is necessary to remove
postings while preserving the temporal diversity of the archive. None of the
existing pruning approaches take (temporal) diversification into account.
  In this paper, we propose a diversification-based static index pruning
method. It differs from the existing pruning approaches by integrating
diversification within the pruning context. We aim at pruning the index while
preserving retrieval effectiveness and diversity by pruning while maximizing a
given IR evaluation metric like DCG. We show how to apply this approach in the
context of web archives. Finally, we show on two collections that search
effectiveness in temporal collections after pruning can be improved using our
approach rather than diversity oblivious approaches.

spatially homogeneous and anisotropic Bianchi type-I space-time. To study the
transit behaviour of Universe, we consider a law of variation of scale factor
$a(t) = \left(t^{k} e^{t}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}$ which yields a time dependent
deceleration parameter $q = - 1 + \frac{nk}{(k + t)^{2}}$, comprising a class
of models that depicts a transition of the universe from the early decelerated
phase to the recent accelerating phase. We find that the time dependent
deceleration parameter is reasonable for the present day Universe and give an
appropriate description of the evolution of the universe. For $n = 0.27k$, we
obtain $q_{0} = -0.73$ which is similar to observed value of deceleration
parameter at present epoch. It is also observed that for $n \geq 2$ and $k =
1$, we obtain a class of transit models of the universe from early decelerating
to present accelerating phase. For $k = 0$, the universe has non-singular
origin. In these models, we arrive at the decision that, from the structure of
the field equations, the behaviour of cosmological and gravitational constants
and are related. Taking into consideration the observational data, we conclude
that the cosmological constant behaves as a positive decreasing function of
time whereas gravitational constant is increasing and tend to a constant value

Survey Explorer (WISE). The combined sample consists of 79 quasars and 273
radio galaxies, and covers a redshift range 0.003<z<3.395. The dichotomy in the
mid-IR properties of low- and high-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs - HERGs) is
analysed for the first time using large complete samples. Our results
demonstrate that a division in the accretion modes of LERGs and HERGs clearly
stands out in the mid-IR-radio plane (L_(22 \mu m) = 5x10^(43) erg s^(-1)).
This means that WISE data can be effectively used to diagnose accretion modes
in radio-loud AGN. The mid-IR properties of all objects were analysed to test
the unification between quasars and radio galaxies, consistent with earlier
work and we argue that smooth torus models best reproduce the observation.
Quasars are found to have higher mid-IR luminosities than radio galaxies. We
also studied all the sources in the near-IR to gain insights into evolution of
AGN host galaxies. A relation found between the near-IR luminosity and
redshift, well-known in the near-IR, is apparent in the two near-IR WISE bands,
supporting the idea that radio sources are hosted by massive elliptical
galaxies that formed their stars at high redshifts and evolved passively
thereafter. Evaluation of the positions of the sample objects in WISE
colour-colour diagrams shows that widely used WISE colour cuts are not
completely reliable in selecting AGN.

error-disturbance inequalities derived by Ozawa and others by expressing them
in the reduced system space. The interpretation of the definitions as
mean-squared deviations relies on an implicit assumption that is generally
incompatible with the Bell-Kochen-Specker-Spekkens contextuality theorems, and
which results in averaging the deviations over a non-positive-semidefinite
joint quasiprobability distribution. For unbiased measurements, the error
admits a concrete interpretation as the dispersion in the estimation of the
mean induced by the measurement ambiguity. We demonstrate how to directly
measure not only this dispersion but also every observable moment with the same
experimental data, and thus demonstrate that perfect distributional estimations
can have nonzero error according to this measure. We conclude that the
inequalities using these definitions do not capture the spirit of Heisenberg's
eponymous inequality, but do indicate a qualitatively different relationship
between dispersion and disturbance that is appropriate for ensembles being
probed by all outcomes of an apparatus. To reconnect with the discussion of
Heisenberg, we suggest alternative definitions of error and disturbance that
are intrinsic to a single apparatus outcome. These definitions naturally
involve the retrodictive and interdictive states for that outcome, and produce
complementarity and error-disturbance inequalities that have the same form as
the traditional Heisenberg relation.

The intervening halos and voids disturb the magnification ratios of lensed
images as well as their relative positions due to lensing. The magnification
ratios typically change by O(10%) when the shifts of relative angular positions
of lensed images are constrained to <0.004 arcsec. The constrained amplitudes
of projected density perturbations due to line-of-sight structures are O(10^8)

estimate based on the two-point correlation of density fluctuations. The
observed mid-infrared (MIR) flux ratios for 6 quasar-galaxy lens systems with
quadruple images agree well with the numerically estimated values without
taking into account of subhalos residing in the lensing galaxies. We find that
the constrained mean amplitudes of projected density perturbations in the

perturbed mainly by minivoids and minihalos in underdense regions. We derive a

increases with decreasing interpeptide distance, the total hydrogen bond number

idea that excluding water in proteins comes with an enthalpic penalty. We also

  Social Networks",,,,,"stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The latent position cluster model is a popular model for the statistical
analysis of network data. This approach assumes that there is an underlying
latent space in which the actors follow a finite mixture distribution.
Moreover, actors which are close in this latent space tend to be tied by an
edge. This is an appealing approach since it allows the model to cluster actors
which consequently provides the practitioner with useful qualitative
information. However, exploring the uncertainty in the number of underlying
latent components in the mixture distribution is a very complex task. The
current state-of-the-art is to use an approximate form of BIC for this purpose,
where an approximation of the log-likelihood is used instead of the true
log-likelihood which is unavailable. The main contribution of this paper is to
show that through the use of conjugate prior distributions it is possible to
analytically integrate out almost all of the model parameters, leaving a
posterior distribution which depends on the allocation vector of the mixture
model. A consequence of this is that it is possible to carry out posterior
inference over the number of components in the latent mixture distribution
without using trans-dimensional MCMC algorithms such as reversible jump MCMC.
Moreover, our algorithm allows for more reasonable computation times for larger
networks than the standard methods using the latentnet package (Krivitsky and
Handcock 2008; Krivitsky and Handcock 2013).

from that of the hotter stars, mainly owing to the more gradual transition from

threshold. Furthermore, we show the possibility of coexistence in SIS-type
competitive spreading over multilayer networks. Not only do we rigorously prove
a region of coexistence, we quantitate it via interrelation of central nodes
across the network layers. Little to no overlapping of layers central nodes is
the key determinant of coexistence. Specifically, we show coexistence is
impossible if network layers are identical yet possible if the network layers
have distinct dominant eigenvectors and node degree vectors. For example, we
show both analytically and numerically that positive correlation of network
layers makes it difficult for a virus to survive while in a network with
negatively correlated layers survival is easier but total removal of the other
virus is more difficult. We believe our methodology has great potentials for
application to broader classes of multi-pathogen spreading over multi-layer and

explanation for these flares is the interaction of a relativistic blast wave
with a circumburst density transition. In this paper, we model this type of
interaction computationally in one and two dimensions, using a relativistic
hydrodynamics code with adaptive mesh refinement called ram, and analytically
in one dimension. We simulate a blast wave traveling in a stellar wind
environment that encounters a sudden change in density, followed by a
homogeneous medium, and compute the observed radiation using a synchrotron
model. We show that flares are not observable for an encounter with a sudden
density increase, such as a wind termination shock, nor for an encounter with a
sudden density decrease. Furthermore, by extending our analysis to two
dimensions, we are able to resolve the spreading, collimation, and edge effects
of the blast wave as it encounters the change in circumburst medium. In all
cases considered in this paper, we find that a flare will not be observed for

(NSs), formed via type Ib/c core-collapse supernovae (SNe), which have been
spun up to high rotation rates via accretion from a companion star in a
low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB). In an alternative formation channel, NSs are
produced via the accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of a massive white dwarf (WD)
in a close binary. Here we investigate binary evolution leading to AIC and
examine if NSs formed in this way can subsequently be recycled to form MSPs
and, if so, how they can observationally be distinguished from pulsars formed
via the standard core-collapse SN channel in terms of their masses, spins,
orbital periods and space velocities. Numerical calculations with a detailed
stellar evolution code were used for the first time to study the combined pre-
and post-AIC evolution of close binaries. We investigated the mass transfer
onto a massive WD in 240 systems with three different types of non-degenerate
donor stars: main-sequence stars, red giants, and helium stars. When the WD is
able to accrete sufficient mass (depending on the mass-transfer rate and the
duration of the accretion phase) we assumed it collapses to form a NS and we
studied the dynamical effects of this implosion on the binary orbit.
Subsequently, we followed the mass-transfer epoch which resumes once the donor
star refills its Roche lobe and calculated the continued LMXB evolution until
the end. We demonstrate that the final properties of these MSPs are, in
general, remarkably similar to those of MSPs formed via the standard
core-collapse SN channel. However, the resultant MSPs created via the AIC
channel preferentially form in certain orbital period intervals. Finally, we
discuss the link between AIC and young NSs in globular clusters. Our
calculations are also applicable to progenitor binaries of SNe Ia under certain

  TD-srDFT Based on Long-Range MP2 and MCSCF Wave Functions","13 pages",,,,"physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Charge transfer excitations can be described within TD-DFT, not only by means
of long-range corrected exchange functionals but also with a combination of
wave function theory and TD-DFT based on range separation. The latter approach
enables a rigorous formulation of multi-determinantal TD-DFT schemes where
excitation classes, which are absent in conventional TD-DFT spectra (like for
example double excitations), can be addressed. This paper investigates the
combination of both the long-range MCSCF and SOPPA ans\""atze with a short-range
DFT (srDFT) description. We find that the combinations of SOPPA or MCSCF with
TD-DFT yield better results than could be expected from the pure wave function
schemes. For the Time-Dependent MCSCF short-range DFT ansatz (TD-MC-srDFT)
excitation energies calculated over a larger benchmark set of molecules with
predominantly single reference character yield good agreement with their
reference values, and are in general comparable to the long-range corrected
functional CAM-B3LYP. The SOPPA-srDFT scheme is tested for a subset of
molecules used for benchmarking TD-MC-srDFT and performs slightly better
against the reference data for this small subset. Beyond the proof-of-principle
calculations comprising the first part of this contribution, we additionally
studied the low-lying singlet excited states (S1 and S2) of the retinal
chromophore. The chromophore displays multireference character in the ground
state and both excited states exhibit considerable double excitation character,
which in turn cannot be described within standard TD-DFT, due to the adiabatic
approximation. However, a TD-MC-srDFT approach can account for the
multireference character, and excitation energies are obtained with accuracy
comparable to CASPT2, although using a much smaller active space.

sets of the form $x\ge \xi t^{1/2}$, $\xi>0$, the outer region, the asymptotic
behavior is given by a multiple of the dipole solution for the local heat

determined from a conservation law, related to the asymptotic first momentum.
On compact sets, the inner region, after scaling the solution by a factor
$t^{3/2}$, it converges to a multiple of the unique stationary solution of the
problem that behaves as $x$ at infinity. The precise proportionality factor is
obtained through a matching procedure with the outer behavior. Since the outer

be done for the scaled function $t^{3/2}u(x,t)/x$, which takes into account
that different scales lead to different decay rates.

depends on how the original dynamics are split between the local and global
dynamics. As an explicit example, we apply the scheme to study thermalization
of the pinned harmonic chain with velocity flips. We improve on the previous
results about this system by showing that after a relatively short time period
the average kinetic temperature profile satisfies the dynamic Fourier's law in
a local microscopic sense without assuming that the initial data is close to a
local equilibrium state. The bounds derived here prove that the above
thermalization period is at most of the order L^(2/3), where L denotes the
number of particles in the chain. In particular, even before the diffusive time
scale Fourier's law becomes a valid approximation of the evolution of the
kinetic temperature profile. As a second application of the dynamic replica
method, we also briefly discuss replacing the velocity flips by an anharmonic
onsite potential.

fundamental-frequency (FF) wave, while the real potential acts on the

stability is investigated (by means of the linearization and direct
simulations) in semi-infinite and finite gaps in the corresponding spectrum,
starting from the bifurcation which generates the solitons from edges of the
gaps' edges. Families of solitons embedded into the conttinuous spectrum of the
SH component are found too, and it is demonstrated that a part of the families
of these \textit{embedded solitons} (ESs) is stable. The analysis is focused on
effects produced by the variation of the strength of the imaginary part of the
potential, which is a specific characteristic of the $\mathcal{PT}$ system. The

potentials acting on the FF\ and SH components. The case of the real potential

Dirac cone dispersion in the recently discovered topological crystalline
insulators (TCIs) are protected by crystal symmetry. To date, TCI behaviors
have been observed in SnTe and the related alloys Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$Se/Te,
which incorporate heavy elements with large spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Here, by
combining first-principles and {\it ab initio} tight-binding calculations, we
report the formation of a TCI in the relatively lighter rock-salt SnS and SnSe.
This TCI is characterized by an even number of Dirac cones at the high-symmetry
(001), (110) and (111) surfaces, which are protected by the reflection symmetry
with respect to the ($\bar{1}$10) mirror plane. We find that both SnS and SnSe
have an intrinsically inverted band structure and the SOC is necessary only to
open the bulk band gap. The bulk band gap evolution upon volume expansion
reveals a topological transition from an ambient pressure TCI to a
topologically trivial insulator. Our results indicate that the SOC alone is not
sufficient to drive the topological transition.

  Organizations","Published in AMCIS 2013",,,,"cs.CR cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mobile devices, such as phones, tablets and laptops, expose businesses and
governments to a multitude of information security risks. While Information
Systems research has focused on the security and privacy aspects from the
end-user perspective regarding mobile devices, very little research has been
conducted within corporate environments. In this work, thirty-two mobile
devices were returned by employees in a global Fortune 500 company. In the
empirical analysis, a number of significant security risks were uncovered which
may have led to leakage of valuable intellectual property or exposed the
organization to future legal conflicts. The research contribution is an initial
empirical report highlighting examples of corporate policy breaches by users
along with providing a foundation for future research on the security risks of
the pervasive presence of mobile devices in corporate environments.

Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise (KLJN) key distribution. The error probability
decays exponentially with increasing bit exchange period and fixed bandwidth,
which is similar to the error probability decay in the voltage measurement
mode. We also analyze the combination of voltage and current modes for error
removal. In this combination method, the error probability is still an
exponential function that decays with the duration of the bit exchange period,
but it has superior fidelity to the former schemes.

  structure and in Krafts inequality",,,,,"cs.DM math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A good deal of research has been done and published on coloring of the
vertices of graphs for several years while studying of the excellent work of
those maestros, we get inspire to work on the vertex coloring of graphs in case
of a particular triangular closed path structure what we achieve from the front
view of a pyramidal structure. From here we achieve a repetitive nature of
vertex coloring in case of odd and even number of horizontal lines within this
triangular structure. In order to apply this repetitive nature of vertex
coloring in case of a binary tree, we get a success in Krafts Inequality.
Actually our work mainly deals with a particular triangular closed path vertex
coloring and repetition of the vertex coloring nature in case of the Krafts
inequality in the field of Information Theory and Coding.

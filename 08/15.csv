not on its specific form. This allows to justify the seemingly inconsistent
calculation of the $h^0\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$ amplitude in the minimal

in cylindrically stratified media is a classical problem for which analytical
expressions of the associated tensor Green's function have been long known.
However, under finite-precision arithmetic, direct numerical computations based
on the application of such analytical (canonical) expressions invariably lead
to underflow and overflow problems related to the poor scaling of the
eigenfunctions (cylindrical Bessel and Hankel functions) for extreme arguments
and/or high-order, as well as convergence problems related to the numerical
integration over the spectral wavenumber and to the truncation of the infinite
series over the azimuth mode number. These problems are exacerbated when a
disparate range of values is to be considered for the layers' thicknesses and
material properties (resistivities, permittivities, and permeabilities), the
transverse and longitudinal distances between source and observation points, as
well as the source frequency. To overcome these challenges in a systematic
fashion, we introduce herein different sets of range-conditioned, modified
cylindrical functions (in lieu of standard cylindrical eigenfunctions), each
associated with non-overlapped subdomains of (numerical) evaluation to allow
for stable computations under any range of physical parameters. In addition
adaptively-chosen integration contours are employed in the complex spectral
wavenumber plane to ensure convergent numerical integration in all cases. We
illustrate the application of the algorithm to problems of geophysical interest
involving layer resistivities ranging from 1000 $\Omega \cdot$m to 10$^{-8}

arise naturally. As for ordinary spectral sequences we will see differentials
and group extensions, however the real power comes from the appearance of
natural isomorphims between pages of differing indices.
  The constructions reveal finer invariants than ordinary spectral sequences,
and they connect to other fields such as Fary functors and perverse sheaves.
They are based on a natural index scheme, which allows us to obtain new results
even in the standard case of Z-filtered chain complexes, e.g. a useful
criterion for a product structure for Grothendieck's spectral sequences, and
news paths to connect the first or second page to the limit.
  This turns out to yield the right framework for unifying several spectral
sequences that one would usually apply one after another. Examples that we work

noteworthy cases are 15-point simplices in HP^2 and 27-point simplices in OP^2,
both of which are the largest simplices and the smallest 2-designs possible in
their respective spaces. These codes are all universally optimal, by a theorem
of Cohn and Kumar. We also show the existence of several positive-dimensional
families of simplices in the Grassmannians of subspaces of R^n with n <= 8;
close numerical approximations to these families had been found by Conway,
Hardin, and Sloane, but no proof of existence was known. Our existence proofs
are computer-assisted, and the main tool is a variant of the Newton-Kantorovich
theorem. This effective implicit function theorem shows, in favorable
conditions, that every approximate solution to a set of polynomial equations
has a nearby exact solution. Finally, we also exhibit a few explicit codes,
including a configuration of 39 points in OP^2 that form a maximal system of

photons produced in GRB afterglow shocks has on the light-curves and spectra of
Fermi-LAT afterglows. Afterglows produced by the interaction of a relativistic
outflow with a wind-like medium peak when the blast-wave deceleration sets in,
and the afterglow spectrum could be hardening before that peak, as the optical
thickness to pair-formation is decreasing. In contrast, in afterglows produced
in the interaction with a homogeneous medium, the optical thickness to
pair-formation should increase and yield a light-curve peak when it reaches
unity, followed by a fast light-curve decay, accompanied by a spectral
softening. If energy is injected in the blast-wave, then the accelerated
increase of the optical thickness yields a convex afterglow light-curve. Other
features, such as a double-peak light-curve or a broad hump, can arise from the
evolution of the optical thickness to photon-photon absorption. Fast decays and
convex light-curves are seen in a few LAT afterglows, but the expected spectral
softening is rarely seen in (and difficult to measure with) LAT observations.
Furthermore, for the effects of photon-photon attenuation to shape the
high-energy afterglow light-curve without attenuating it too much, the ejecta
initial Lorentz factor must be in a relatively narrow range (50-200), which
reduces the chance of observing those effects.

coherence emerging from the incoherent ground state and similar transfer of
spectral weight from high to low frequency. These observations are compatible
with previous reports of an inhomogeneous normal state that retains important
properties of a superconductor, in which light may be melting competing orders

bound dimer that occupies a threefold-degenerate $p$ orbital of the confinement

exponent given by $T_K\propto\exp[-\pi/(3a_p k_F^3)]$ that depends only on an

also elucidate a Kondo singlet formation at zero temperature and an anisotropic

successive applications of the convolution operator.

results to higher dimensions, by reformulating the ADI scheme to include
recursive convolution. Thus, we retain a fast, unconditionally stable scheme,
which does not suffer from the large dispersion errors characteristic to the
ADI method. We demonstrate the utility of the method by applying it to a host

  Aims. The ultimate aim of the project is to improve the completeness of the

  Methods. Taking advantage of the homogeneous sample of VVV multi-epoch data,
we identified stars with high proper motion (> 0.1""/yr), and then selected

motion, distance, and luminosity. The spectral type of this new object is an

the interstellar medium (ISM), including heating and driving turbulence in the

this leads to a quasi-equilibrium self-regulated state, and for outer
atomic-dominated disks results in the surface density of star formation
$\Sigma_{SFR}$ varying approximately linearly with the weight of the ISM (or
midplane turbulent + thermal pressure). We use three-dimensional numerical
hydrodynamic simulations to test the theoretical predictions for thermal,
turbulent, and vertical dynamical equilibrium, and the implied functional
dependence of $\Sigma_{SFR}$ on local disk properties. Our models demonstrate
that all equilibria are established rapidly, and that the expected
proportionalities between mean thermal and turbulent pressures and
$\Sigma_{SFR}$ apply. For outer disk regions, this results in $\Sigma_{SFR}
\propto \Sigma \sqrt{\rho_{sd}}$, where $\Sigma$ is the total gas surface
density and $\rho_{sd}$ is the midplane density of the stellar disk (plus dark
matter). This scaling law arises because $\rho_{sd}$ sets the vertical
dynamical time in our models (and outer disk regions generally). The
coefficient in the star formation law varies inversely with the specific energy
and momentum yield from massive stars. We find proportions of warm and cold
atomic gas, turbulent-to-thermal pressure, and mean velocity dispersions that
are consistent with Solar-neighborhood and other outer-disk observations. This

cools via neutrino emission at >~ 0.003-0.01 M_sun s^{-1} (corresponding to a
luminosity of ~10^50 erg s^{-1}), while neither neutrino nor photon emission is
efficient below this rate, so the flow should be advection dominated. We
carefully solve how a transition occurs from the advection-dominated to the
neutrino-dominated branches, and find that the slope of the thermal equilibrium
curve is negative in the surface density - accretion rate (Sigma-Mdot) plane, a
condition for viscous instability, at radii smaller than ~12R_g (with R_g being
the gravitational radius). We also confirm that the flow is thermally stable.
The consequence of this instability is the formation of a clumpy structure in
the flow. This is because the larger (respectively smaller) surface density is,
the smaller (respectively larger) the mass accretion rate from the region in
question becomes, leading to growth of the density contrast. The timescale for
clump formation is estimated to be shorter than 0.1s. The observational
implication is discussed in the context of GRBs. We suggest that this might
explain the origin of the large variability observed in the prompt emission of

superfluid phase is unstable against developing additonal chiral order that
breaks time reversal (T) and parity (P) symmetries by forming a condensate at
nonzero wavevector. We demonstrate that the loss of superfluidity can lead to
an even more exotic phase, the chiral Mott insulator, with nontrivial current
order that breaks T, P. These results are obtained via variational estimates,

developed a software package that is specifically designed for precision D/H

further measures of (D/H)_p with a precision comparable to those considered

propagation and acceleration. We employ the description of spatial separation
of magnetic field lines in MHD turbulence in Lazarian & Vishniac (1999) to
quantify the divergence of magnetic field on scales less than the injection
scale of turbulence and show this divergence induces superdiffusion of CR in
the direction perpendicular to the mean magnetic field. The perpendicular
displacement squared increases, not as distance $x$ along magnetic field, which
is the case for a regular diffusion, but as the $x^{3}$ for freely streaming
CRs. The dependence changes to $x^{3/2}$ for the CRs propagating diffusively
along magnetic field. In the latter case we show that it is important to
distinguish the perpendicular displacement in respect to the mean field and to
the local magnetic field. We consider how superdiffusion changes the
acceleration of CRs in shocks and show how it decreases efficiency of the CRs
acceleration in perpendicular shocks. We also demonstrate that in the case when
small-scale magnetic field is being generated in the pre-shock region, an
efficient acceleration can take place for the CRs streaming without collisions
along magnetic loops.

parametric resonances (PRs) in systems with the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry, i.e.,
a pair of coupled and mutually balanced gain and loss elements. The parametric
(ac) forcing is applied through periodic modulation of the coefficient
accounting for the coupling of the two degrees of freedom. The system may be
realized in optics as a dual-core waveguide with the gain and loss applied to
different cores, and the thickness of the gap between them subject to a
periodic modulation. The onset and development of the parametric instability
for a small forcing amplitude ($V_{1}$) is studied in an analytical form. The
full dynamical chart of the system is generated by systematic simulations. At
sufficiently large values of the forcing frequency, $\omega $, tongues of the
parametric instability originate, with the increase of $V_{1}$, as predicted by
the analysis. However, the tongues following further increase of $V_{1}$
feature a pattern drastically different from that in usual
(non-$\mathcal{PT}$)\ parametrically driven systems: instead of bending down to
larger values of the dc coupling constant, $V_{0}$, they maintain a direction
parallel to the $V_{1}$ axis. The system of the parallel tongues gets dense
with the decrease of $\omega $, merging into a complex small-scale structure of
alternating regions of stability and instability. The cases of $\omega
\rightarrow 0$ and $\omega \rightarrow \infty $ are studied analytically by
means of the adiabatic and averaging approximation, respectively. The cubic
nonlinearity, if added to the system, alters the picture, destabilizing many
originally robust dynamical regimes, and stabilizing some which were unstable.

  welcome",,"10.1093/mnras/stt1693",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We analyze the basic properties of Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) produced
by state of the art cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamical simulations. These
simulations have been run with different sub-grid physics included. Here we
focus on the results obtained with and without the inclusion of the
prescriptions for supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth and of the ensuing
Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback. The latter process goes in the right
direction of decreasing significantly the overall formation of stars. However,
BCGs end up still containing too much stellar mass, a problem that increases
with halo mass, and having an unsatisfactory structure. This is in the sense
that their effective radii are too large, and that their density profiles
feature a flattening on scales much larger than observed. We also find that our
model of thermal AGN feedback has very little effect on the stellar velocity
dispersions, which turn out to be very large. Taken together, these problems,
which to some extent can be recognized also in other numerical studies
typically dealing with smaller halo masses, indicate that on one hand present
day sub-resolution models of AGN feedback are not effective enough in
diminishing the global formation of stars in the most massive galaxies, but on
the other hand they are relatively too effective in their centers. It is likely
that a form of feedback generating large scale gas outflows from BCGs
precursors, and a more widespread effect over the galaxy volume, can alleviate
these difficulties.

  2-Colorable Hypergraphs","30 pages",,,,"cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work studies the hardness of finding independent sets in hypergraphs
which are either 2-colorable or are almost 2-colorable, i.e. can be 2-colored
after removing a small fraction of vertices and the incident hyperedges. To be
precise, say that a hypergraph is (1-eps)-almost 2-colorable if removing an eps
fraction of its vertices and all hyperedges incident on them makes the
remaining hypergraph 2-colorable. In particular we prove the following results.
  For an arbitrarily small constant gamma > 0, there is a constant xi > 0, such
that, given a 4-uniform hypergraph on n vertices which is (1 - eps)-almost
2-colorable for eps = 2^{-(log n)^xi}, it is quasi-NP-hard to find an
independent set of n/(2^{(log n)^{1-gamma}}) vertices.
  For any constants eps, delta > 0, given as input a 3-uniform hypergraph on
$n$ vertices which is (1-eps)-almost 2-colorable, it is NP-hard to find an
independent set of delta n vertices. Assuming the d-to-1 Games Conjecture the
following holds.
  For any constant delta > 0, given a 2-colorable 3-uniform hypergraph on n
vertices, it is NP-hard to find an independent set of delta n vertices.
  The hardness result on independent set in almost 2-colorable 3-uniform
hypergraphs was earlier known only assuming the Unique Games Conjecture. In
this work we prove the result unconditionally. For independent sets in
2-colorable 3-uniform hypergaphs we prove the first strong hardness result,
albeit assuming the d-to-1 Games Conjecture. Our result on almost 2-colorable
4-uniform hypergraphs gives the first nearly polynomial hardness factor for
independent set in hypergraphs which are (almost) colorable with constantly
many colors. It partially bridges the gap between the previous best lower bound
of poly(log n) and the algorithmic upper bounds of n^{Omega(1)}.

wavelength range covering from 310 to 2475 nm. We have monitored the continuum
excess in the Balmer region of the spectra and the luminosity of twelve
ultraviolet, optical and near infrared spectral lines that are commonly used as
accretion tracers for T Tauri stars. The observed strengths of the Balmer
excesses have been reproduced from a magnetospheric accretion shock model,
providing a mean mass accretion rate of 1.11 x 10^-7 and 4.50 x 10^-7 Msun
yr^-1 for HD 31648 and HD 163296, respectively. Accretion rate variations are
observed, being more pronounced for HD 31648 (up to 0.5 dex). However, from the
comparison with previous results it is found that the accretion rate of HD
163296 has increased by more than 1 dex, on a timescale of ~ 15 years. Averaged
accretion luminosities derived from the Balmer excess are consistent with the
ones inferred from the empirical calibrations with the emission line
luminosities, indicating that those can be extrapolated to HAe stars. In spite
of that, the accretion rate variations do not generally coincide with those
estimated from the line luminosities, suggesting that the empirical
calibrations are not useful to accurately quantify accretion rate variability.

chemo-dynamical evolutionary models of the Milky Way. Given the PL relations
that provide accurate distances and the large number of spectral lines,
Cepheids are excellent tracers of the present-day abundance gradients. Aims: We
want to measure the Galactic abundance gradient of several chemical elements.
While the slope of the Cepheid iron gradient did not vary much from the very
first studies, the gradients of the other elements are not that well
constrained. In this paper we focus on the inner and outer regions of the
Galactic thin disk. Methods: We use HR spectra (FEROS, ESPADONS, NARVAL) to
measure the abundances of several light (Na, Al), alpha (Mg, Si, S, Ca), and
heavy elements (Y, Zr, La, Ce, Nd, Eu) in a sample of 65 Milky Way Cepheids.
Combining these results with accurate distances from period-Wesenheit relations
in the NIR enables us to determine the abundance gradients in the Milky Way.
Results: Our results are in good agreement with previous studies on either
Cepheids or other tracers. In particular, we confirm an upward shift of
approximatively 0.2 dex for the Mg abundances, as has recently been reported.
We also confirm the existence of a gradient for all the heavy elements studied
in the context of a LTE analysis. However, for Y, Nd, and especially La, we
find lower abundances for Cepheids in the outer disk than reported in previous
studies, leading to steeper gradients. This effect can be explained by the
differences in the line lists used by different groups. Conclusions: Our data
do not support a flattening of the gradients in the outer disk, in agreement
with recent Cepheid studies and chemo-dynamical simulations. This is in
contrast to the open cluster observations but remains compatible with a picture
where the transition zone between the inner disk and the outer disk would move
outward with time.

accounts for Milgrom's scaling, usually associated with modified Newtonian

cluster and cosmic scales. In this paper, we provide the first observational
test of MDM by fitting rotation curves to a sample of 30 local spiral galaxies
(z approximately 0.003). For comparison, we also fit the galactic rotation
curves using MOND, and CDM. We find that all three models fit the data well.
The rotation curves predicted by MDM and MOND are virtually indistinguishable
over the range of observed radii (~1 to 30 kpc). The best-fit MDM and CDM
density profiles are compared. We also compare with MDM the dark matter density
profiles arising from MOND if Milgrom's formula is interpreted as Newtonian
gravity with an extra source term instead of as a modification of inertia. We
find that discrepancies between MDM and MOND will occur near the center of a
typical spiral galaxy. In these regions, instead of continuing to rise sharply,
the MDM mass density turns over and drops as we approach the center of the
galaxy. Our results show that MDM, which restricts the nature of the dark

the appearance of a mysterious non-local ideal. Our goal is to facilitate
progress on Rasmussen's conjecture that a spectral sequence relates the two

quantum topological language of framings on trivalent graphs. We define a
homology theory for framed trivalent graphs with boundary that -- for a
particular non-blackboard framing -- specializes to the homology of singular
knots underlying the knot Floer cube of resolutions. For blackboard framed
graphs, our theory conjecturally recovers the graph homology underlying the
HOMFLY-PT chain complex. We explain the appearance of the non-local ideal by
expressing it as an ideal quotient of an ideal that appears in both the
HOMFLY-PT and knot Floer cubes of resolutions. This result is a corollary of
our main theorem, which is that closing a strand in a braid graph corresponds
to taking an ideal quotient of its non-local ideal. The proof is a Gr\""obner

frequency domain, ""PhenomP"", which captures the basic phenomenology of the
seven-dimensional parameter space of binary configurations with only three key
physical parameters. Two of these (the binary's mass ratio and an effective
total spin parallel to the orbital angular momentum, which determines the
inspiral rate) define an underlying non-precessing-binary model. The
non-precessing-binary waveforms are then ""twisted up"" with approximate
expressions for the precessional motion, which require only one additional
physical parameter, an effective precession spin, $\chi_p$. All other
parameters (total mass, sky location, orientation and polarisation, and initial
phase) can be specified trivially. The model is constructed in the frequency
domain, which will be essential for efficient GW searches and source
measurements. We have tested the model's fidelity for GW applications by
comparison against hybrid post-Newtonian-numerical-relativity waveforms at a
variety of configurations --although we did not use these numerical simulations

multi-user vector broadcast channel with periodic channel state information
(CSI) feedback. As a part of the characterization, a new transmission method
called space-time interference alignment is proposed, which exploits both the
current and past CSI jointly. Using the proposed alignment technique, an inner
bound of the sum-DoF region is characterized as a function of a normalized CSI
feedback frequency, which measures CSI feedback speed compared to the speed of
user's channel variations. One consequence of the result is that the achievable
sum-DoF gain is improved significantly when a user sends back both current and
outdated CSI compared to the case where the user sends back current CSI only.
Then, a trade-off between CSI feedback delay and the sum-DoF gain is
characterized for the multi-user vector broadcast channel in terms of a
normalized CSI feedback delay that measures CSI obsoleteness compared to
channel coherence time. A crucial insight is that it is possible to achieve the
optimal DoF gain if the feedback delay is less than a derived fraction of the
channel coherence time. This precisely characterizes the intuition that a small
delay should be negligible.

Lyman-Werner UV backgrounds that quench H$_2$ formation in their constituent

stark contrast to the explosions in diffuse regions in previous simulations,
these SNe briefly engulf the protogalaxy but then collapse back into its dark

accelerate computations of quasigeostrophic (QG) models for large scale ocean
circulation. These models require solving an elliptic sub-problem at each time
step, which takes the bulk of the computational time. The method we propose
here is a modular approach that facilitates data transfer with simple
interpolations and uses black-box solvers for solving the elliptic sub-problem
and potential vorticity equations in the QG flow solvers. After solving the
elliptic sub-problem on a coarsened grid, an interpolation scheme is used to
obtain the fine data for subsequent time stepping on the full grid. The
potential vorticity field is then updated on the fine grid with savings in
computational time due to the reduced number of grid points for the elliptic
solver. The method is applied to both single layer barotropic and two-layer
stratified QG ocean models for mid-latitude oceanic basins in the beta plane,
which are standard prototypes of more realistic ocean dynamics. The method is
found to accelerate these computations while retaining the same level of
accuracy in the fine-resolution field. A linear acceleration rate is obtained
for all the cases we consider due to the efficient linear-cost fast Fourier
transform based elliptic solver used. We expect the speed-up of the CGP method
to increase dramatically for versions of the method that use other, suboptimal,
elliptic solvers, which are generally quadratic cost. It is also demonstrated
that numerical oscillations due to lower grid resolutions, in which the Munk
scales are not resolved adequately, are effectively eliminated with CGP method.

temperature, T_in increases with the increase of i for a fixed value of mdot
and a_ast, due to the Doppler effect. However, for i > 50 and mdot > mdot_turn,
T_in starts to decrease with the increase of mdot. This is a result of
self-obscuration -- the radiation from the innermost hot part of the disc is
blocked by the surrounding cooler part. The value of mdot_turn and the
corresponding luminosities depend on a_ast and i. Such obscuration effects
cause an interesting behavior on the disc luminosity (L_disc) -- T_in plane for
high inclinations. In addition to the standard-disc branch which appears below
mdot_turn and which obeys L_disc propto T_in^4 -relation, another branch above
mdot_turn, which is nearly horizontal, may be observed at luminosities close to
the Eddington luminosity. We show that these features are likely observed in a
Galactic X-ray source, GRS 1915+105. We support a high spin parameter (a_ast >

defined to include both the external gas accretion and the internal gas
processing needed to renew reservoirs for star formation. We analyze two z=0
data sets: a high-quality ~200-galaxy sample (the Nearby Field Galaxy Survey,
data release herein) and a volume-limited ~3000-galaxy sample with reprocessed
archival data. Both reach down to baryonic masses ~10^9Msun and span
void-to-cluster environments. Two mass-dependent transitions are evident: (i)
below the ""gas-richness threshold"" scale (V~125km/s), gas-dominated
quasi-bulgeless Sd--Im galaxies become numerically dominant, while (ii) above
the ""bimodality"" scale (V~200km/s), gas-starved E/S0s become the norm.
Notwithstanding these transitions, galaxy mass (or V as its proxy) is a poor
predictor of gas-to-stellar mass ratio M_gas/M_*. Instead, M_gas/M_* correlates
well with the ratio of a galaxy's stellar mass formed in the last Gyr to its
preexisting stellar mass, such that the two ratios have numerically similar
values. This striking correspondence between past-averaged star formation and
current gas richness implies routine refueling of star-forming galaxies on Gyr
timescales. We argue that this refueling underlies the tight M_gas/M_* vs.
color correlations often used to measure ""photometric gas fractions.""
Furthermore, the threshold and bimodality scale transitions reflect
mass-dependent demographic shifts between three refueling regimes --- accretion
dominated, processing dominated, and quenched. In this picture, gas-dominated
dwarfs are explained not by inefficient star formation but by overwhelming gas
accretion, which fuels stellar mass doubling in <~1Gyr. Moreover, moderately
gas-rich bulged disks such as the Milky Way are transitional, becoming abundant
only in the narrow range between the threshold and bimodality scales.

broad-band imaging observations. We base our analysis mainly on two sets of
self-consistently determined LMC cluster ages and masses, one using standard
modelling and one which takes into account the effects of stochasticity in the
clusters' stellar mass functions. On their own, the results based on any of the
three complementary analysis approaches applied here are merely indicative of
the physical conditions governing the cluster population. However, the
combination of our results from all three different diagnostics leaves little
room for any conclusion other than that the optically selected LMC star cluster
population exhibits no compelling evidence of significant disruption -- for
clusters with masses, M_cl, of log(M_cl/M_sun) >= 3.0-3.5 -- between the age
ranges of [3-10] Myr and [30-100] Myr, either ""infant mortality"" or otherwise.
In fact, there is no evidence of any destruction beyond that expected from
simple models just including stellar dynamics and stellar evolution for ages up

margin requirements for complex systems. If $F$ is the bounded output of a
complex system, depending on a vector of $n$ bounded inputs, this inequality
provides a bound $B_F(\epsilon)$, such that the probability of a deviation
exceeding $B_F(\epsilon)$ is less than $\epsilon$. I compare this bound with
the absolute bound, based on the range of $F$. I show that when $n_{eff}$, the
effective number of independent variates, is small, and when $\epsilon$ is
small, the absolute bound is smaller than $B_F(\epsilon)$, while also providing
a smaller probability of exceeding the bound, i.e., zero instead of $\epsilon$.
Thus, for $B_F(\epsilon)$ to be useful, the number of inputs must be large,
with a small dependence on any single input, which is consistent with the usual
guidance for application of concentration-of-measure results. When the number
of inputs is small, or when a small number of inputs account for much of the
uncertainty, the absolute bounds will provide better results. The use of
absolute bounds is equivalent to the original formulation of the method of
Quantification of Margins and Uncertainties (QMU).

Markov approximation cannot reliably describe the dynamical behaviour. This is
the case, for example, in a number of solid state or biological systems, and it

non-Markovian behaviour in a given model. Within this framework, we investigate
the dynamics of a quantum harmonic oscillator linearly coupled to a bosonic
bath. We focus on Gaussian states, which are suitably treated using a
covariance matrix approach. Concentrating on an entanglement based
non-Markovian behaviour quantifier (NMBQ) proposed by Rivas et. al. [1], we
consider the role that near resonant and off-resonant modes play in affecting
the NMBQ. By using a large but finite bath of oscillators for both Ohmic and
super Ohmic spectral densities we find, by systematically increasing the
coupling strength, initially the near resonant modes provide the most
significant non-Markovian effects, while after a certain threshold of coupling
strength the off-resonant modes play the dominant role. We also consider the
NMBQ for two other models where we add a single strongly coupled oscillator to
the model in extra bath mode and 'buffer' configurations, which affects the
modes that determine non-Markovian behaviour.

on the thermal background produced by inflaton decay. Resonant decay of the
spectator is often blocked by large induced thermal masses. We account for the
finite decay width of the inflaton and the protracted build-up of the thermal
bath to determine the early evolution of a homogeneous spectator field, \sigma,
coupled to the Higgs Boson, \Phi, through the term g^2 \sigma^2 \Phi^2, the
only renormalisable coupling of a new scalar to the Standard Model. We find
that for very large higgs-spectator coupling g > 10^{-3}, the resonance is not
always blocked as was previously suggested. As a consequence, the oscillating
spectator can decay quickly. For other parameter values, we find that although
qualitative features of the thermal blocking still hold, the dynamics are
altered compared to the instant decay case. These findings are important for
curvaton models, where the oscillating field must be relatively long lived in
order to produce the curvature perturbation. They are also relevant for other
spectator fields, which must decay sufficiently early to avoid spoiling the
predictions of baryogenesis and nucleosynthesis.

and $E(G)$ the sets of its vertices and edges, respectively. A function
$\varphi:E(G)\rightarrow \{1,...,t\}$ is called a proper edge $t$-coloring of a
graph $G$, if adjacent edges are colored differently and each of $t$ colors is
used. The least value of $t$ for which there exists a proper edge $t$-coloring
of a graph $G$ is denoted by $\chi'(G)$. For any graph $G$, and for any integer
$t$ satisfying the inequality $\chi'(G)\leq t\leq |E(G)|$, we denote by
$\alpha(G,t)$ the set of all proper edge $t$-colorings of $G$. Let us also
define a set $\alpha(G)$ of all proper edge colorings of a graph $G$: $$
\alpha(G)\equiv\bigcup_{t=\chi'(G)}^{|E(G)|}\alpha(G,t). $$
  An arbitrary nonempty finite subset of consecutive integers is called an
interval. If $\varphi\in\alpha(G)$ and $x\in V(G)$, then the set of colors of
edges of $G$ which are incident with $x$ is denoted by $S_G(x,\varphi)$ and is
called a spectrum of the vertex $x$ of the graph $G$ at the proper edge
coloring $\varphi$. If $G$ is a graph and $\varphi\in\alpha(G)$, then define
$f_G(\varphi)\equiv|\{x\in V(G)/S_G(x,\varphi) \textrm{is an interval}\}|$.
  For a graph $G$ and any integer $t$, satisfying the inequality $\chi'(G)\leq

\mu_1(G,t)\equiv\min_{\varphi\in\alpha(G,t)}f_G(\varphi),\qquad
\mu_2(G,t)\equiv\max_{\varphi\in\alpha(G,t)}f_G(\varphi). $$

vanishingly small or zero macroscopic magnetization. We take into account the

$G=(V,E,w)$ with positive real edge weights, and our goal is to maintain a tree
which is a good approximation of the minimum Steiner tree spanning a terminal
set $S \subseteq V$, which changes over time. The changes applied to the
terminal set are either terminal additions (incremental scenario), terminal
removals (decremental scenario), or both (fully dynamic scenario). Our task
here is twofold. We want to support updates in sublinear $o(n)$ time, and keep
the approximation factor of the algorithm as small as possible. We show that we
can maintain a $(6+\varepsilon)$-approximate Steiner tree of a general graph in
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n} \log D)$ time per terminal addition or removal. Here, $D$
denotes the stretch of the metric induced by $G$. For planar graphs we achieve
the same running time and the approximation ratio of $(2+\varepsilon)$.
Moreover, we show faster algorithms for incremental and decremental scenarios.
Finally, we show that if we allow higher approximation ratio, even more
efficient algorithms are possible. In particular we show a polylogarithmic time
$(4+\varepsilon)$-approximate algorithm for planar graphs.
  One of the main building blocks of our algorithms are dynamic distance
oracles for vertex-labeled graphs, which are of independent interest. We also
improve and use the online algorithms for the Steiner tree problem.

adaptability to emerging architectures, having high arithmetic intensity,
tunable accuracy, and relaxable global synchronization requirements. We
demonstrate that, beyond its traditional use as a solver in problems for which
explicit free-space kernel representations are available, the FMM has
applicability as a preconditioner in finite domain elliptic boundary value
problems, by equipping it with boundary integral capability for satisfying
conditions at finite boundaries and by wrapping it in a Krylov method for
extensibility to more general operators. Here, we do not discuss the well
developed applications of FMM to implement matrix-vector multiplications within
Krylov solvers of boundary element methods. Instead, we propose using FMM for
the volume-to-volume contribution of inhomogeneous Poisson-like problems, where
the boundary integral is a small part of the overall computation. Our method
may be used to precondition sparse matrices arising from finite
difference/element discretizations, and can handle a broader range of
scientific applications. Compared with multigrid methods, it is capable of
comparable algebraic convergence rates down to the truncation error of the
discretized PDE, and it offers potentially superior multicore and distributed
memory scalability properties on commodity architecture supercomputers.
Compared with other methods exploiting the low rank character of off-diagonal
blocks of the dense resolvent operator, FMM-preconditioned Krylov iteration may
reduce the amount of communication because it is matrix-free and exploits the
tree structure of FMM. We describe our tests in reproducible detail with freely
available codes and outline directions for further extensibility.

in social networks corresponding to families, friendship circles, work teams,

time, the induced overlaps result in an extremely complicated web of the
communities themselves. Thus, uncovering the intricate community structure of
social networks is a non-trivial task with great potential for practical
applications, gaining a notable interest in the recent years. The Clique
Percolation Method (CPM) is one of the earliest overlapping community finding
methods, which was already used in the analysis of several different social
networks. In this approach the communities correspond to k-clique percolation
clusters, and the general heuristic for setting the parameters of the method is
to tune the system just below the critical point of k-clique percolation.
However, this rule is based on simple physical principles and its validity was
never subject to quantitative analysis. Here we examine the quality of the
partitioning in the vicinity of the critical point using recently introduced
overlapping modularity measures. According to our results on real social- and
other networks, the overlapping modularities show a maximum close to the
critical point, justifying the original criteria for the optimal parameter
settings.

should have an efficient method to suppress powerful linearly polarized
background from the main undulator. In this paper we propose a new method for
such a suppression: an application of the reverse taper in the main undulator.

modulation (bunching) at saturation is practically the same as in the case of
non-tapered undulator while the power of linearly polarized radiation is
suppressed by orders of magnitude. Then strongly modulated electron beam
radiates at full power in the afterburner. Considering SASE3 undulator of the
European XFEL as a practical example, we demonstrate that soft X-ray radiation
pulses with peak power in excess of 100 GW and an ultimately high degree of
circular polarization can be produced. The proposed method is rather universal,
i.e. it can be used at SASE FELs and seeded (self-seeded) FELs, with any
wavelength of interest, in a wide range of electron beam parameters, and with
any repetition rate. It can be used at different X-ray FEL facilities, in
particular at LCLS after installation of the helical afterburner in the near
future.

solidification, often causes the severe destruction of homogeneity and even
some fatal damages. Investigation on its mechanism sheds light on the
understanding and controlling of the formation of solidifying metals,earth's

composes the density contrasts and, to what extent, how it affects channel
segregates. Here, we show that in experimental 500kg and 100 ton commercial
cast steel ingots CS originates from oxide Al2O3/MnS impurity clusters (OICs)
initially nucleated from the oxide (Al2O3) particles, which induce an extra
flow due to sharp density contrast between clusters and melt. The results
uncover that, as OICs enrich and grow, their driven flow becomes stronger than
the traditionally recognized inter-dendritic thermo-solutal convection,
dominating the subsequent opening of the channels. This study extends the
classical macrosegregation theory, highlights a significant technological
breakthrough to control CS, and could quickly yield practical benefits to the
worldwide manufacture of over 50 million tons of ingots, super-thick slab and
heavy castings annually, as well as has general implications for the
elaboration of other related natural phenomena.

through which photoelectrons can tunnel from the nanoparticle into the
semiconductor; photodetection in the infrared range, where photon energies are
below the semiconductor band gap (insufficient for band-to-band absorption in
semiconductor), is therefore possible. The nanoparticles are arranged in a
sparse rectangular lattice so that the wavelength of the lattice-induced
Rayleigh anomalies can overlap the wavelength of the localized surface plasmon
resonance of the individual particles, bringing about collective effects from
the nanoparticle array. Using full-wave numerical simulations, we analyze the
effects of lattice constant, embedding depth, and refractive index step between
the semiconductor layer and an adjacent transparent conductive oxide layer. We
show that the presence of refractive index mismatch between media surrounding
the nanoparticles disrupts the formation of a narrow absorption peak associated
with the Rayleigh anomaly, so the role of collective lattice effects in the
formation of plasmonic resonance is diminished. We also show that 5 to 20-times
increase of photoemission can be achieved on embedding of nanoparticles without
taking into account dynamics of ballistic electrons. The results obtained can
be used to increase efficiency of plasmon-based photodetectors and photovoltaic

covering photon energies from 15 keV to 10 MeV. It was launched in 2002 and
since then the BGO detectors of the Anti-Coincidence shield (ACS) of the SPI
spectrometer have detected many hard X-ray (HXR) bursts from the Sun, producing
lightcurves at photon energies above ~ 100 keV. The spacecraft has a highly
elliptical orbit, providing a long uninterrupted observing time (about 90% of
the orbital period) with nearly constant background due to the reduction of the
crossing time of the Earth's radiation belts. However, due to technical
constraints, INTEGRAL cannot point to the Sun and high-energy solar photons are
always detected in non-standard observation conditions. To make the data useful
for solar studies, we have undertaken a major effort to specify the observing
conditions through Monte-Carlo simulations of the response of ACS for several
selected flares. We check the performance of the model employed for the
Monte-Carlo simulations using RHESSI observations for the same sample of solar
flares. We conclude that, despite the fact that INTEGRAL was not designed to
perform solar observations, ACS is a useful instrument in solar flare research.
In particular, its relatively large effective area allows the determination of
good-quality HXR/gamma-ray lightcurves for X- and M-class solar flares and, in

Dirichlet distribution arises in these models as a fixed point distribution

equations with a sinusoidal body force - is considered over extended periodic
domains to reveal localised spatiotemporal complexity. The flow response
mimicks the forcing at small forcing amplitudes but beyond a critical value
develops a long wavelength instability. The ensuing state is described by a
Cahn-Hilliard-type equation and as a result coarsening dynamics are observed
for random initial data. After further bifurcations, this regime gives way to
multiple attractors, some of which possess spatially-localised time dependence.
Co-existence of such attractors in a large domain gives rise to interesting
collisional dynamics which is captured by a system of 5 (1-space and 1-time)
PDEs based on a long wavelength limit. The coarsening regime reinstates itself
at yet higher forcing amplitudes in the sense that only longest-wavelength
solutions remain attractors. Eventually, there is one global longest-wavelength
attractor which possesses two localised chaotic regions - a kink and antikink -
which connect two steady one-dimensional flow regions of essentially half the
domain width each. The wealth of spatiotemporal complexity uncovered presents a
bountiful arena in which to study the existence of simple invariant localised

highly disrupted system. If the merger scenario is correct then the event may
be in its early stages, acting as the trigger for both the young radio jets in
the quasar and a starburst in the merging galaxy. The total molecular gas mass
in the spatially offset line emitter as measured from the ground-state CO line
M_H2 = 3.7 (+/-0.4) x 10^10 (alpha_CO/0.8) M_solar. Assuming that the
line-emitter can be modelled as a rotating disk, an inclination-dependent upper
limit is derived for its dynamical mass M_dyn sin^2(i) < 3.2 x 10^9 M_solar,
suggesting that for M_H2 to remain less than M_dyn the inclination angle must
be i < 16 degrees. The far infrared and CO luminosities of 246 extragalactic
systems are collated from the literature for comparison. The high molecular gas
content of 3C318 is consistent with that of the general population of high
redshift quasars and sub-millimetre galaxies.

mostly been of the SIR-compartmental type, based on the assumption that
populations are homogeneous and well-mixed. The focus of these models have
typically been on large-scale analysis of scenarios such as cities, nations or
even world scale. SIR models are appealing because of their simplicity, but
their parameters, especially the transmission rate, are complex and depend on a
number of factors, which makes it hard to predict how a change of a single
environmental, demographic, or epidemiological factor will affect the
population. Therefore, in this contribution we start to unpick the
transmission-rate parameter. Analysing the implications that arise when taking
crowd behaviour explicitly into account, we show how both the rate of infection
as well as the walking speed depend on the local crowd density around an
infected individual. The combined effect is that the rate of infection at a
population scale has an analytically tractable non-linear dependency on crowd
density. We model the spread of a hypothetical disease in a corridor and
compare our new model with a typical compartmental model, which highlights the
regime in which current models may not produce credible results.

networks keeping track of all individual spike times and the identities of
individual neurons. For delayed, purely inhibitory interactions we show that
the irregular dynamics is not chaotic but in fact stable. Moreover, we
demonstrate that after long transients the dynamics converges towards periodic
orbits and that every generic periodic orbit of these dynamical systems is
stable. We investigate the collective irregular dynamics upon increasing the
time scale of synaptic responses and upon iteratively replacing inhibitory by
excitatory interactions. Whereas for small and moderate time scales as well as
for few excitatory interactions, the dynamics stays stable, there is a smooth
transition to chaos if the synaptic response becomes sufficiently slow (even in
purely inhibitory networks) or the number of excitatory interactions becomes
too large. These results indicate that chaotic and stable dynamics are equally
capable of generating the irregular neuronal activity. More generally, chaos
apparently is not essential for generating high irregularity of balanced
activity, and we suggest that a mechanism different from chaos and
stochasticity significantly contributes to irregular activity in cortical
circuits.

Although the high pressure orthorhombic phase ($\textit{Pbnm}$) starts emerging

strong correlation is observed between the Fe(Se,Te)$_{4}$ tetrahedral
deformation in the tetragonal phase ($\textit{P4/nmm}$) and the sharp rise of
T$_c$ up to $\sim$4 GPa, above which T$_c$ is found to be almost pressure
independent at least up to 10 GPa. A subtle structural modification of the
tetragonal phase is noticed above 10 GPa, suggesting a structural transition
with possible Fe$^{2+}$ spin-state transition. The evolution with pressure of
the optical conductivity shows that the Drude term increases systematically
with pressure up to 5.4 GPa, indicating the evolution of the tetragonal phase
towards a conventional metallic state. At further higher pressures the Drude
term reduces drastically implying a poor metallic character of the high

high-$T_c$ cuprates. In the stripe and zigzag phases clear quasiparticles
features appear in spectral functions of those propagators where holes are
created and annihilated on one sublattice, while they remain largely {\it

experiments. As the most surprising result, we find a totally incoherent
spectral weight distribution for the spectral function of a hole moving in the
Kitaev spin-liquid phase in the strong coupling regime relevant for iridates.
At intermediate coupling the finite systems calculation reveals a well defined
quasiparticle at the $\Gamma$ point, however, we find that the gapless spin
excitations wipe out quasiparticles at finite momenta. Also for this more
subtle case we conclude that in the thermodynamic limit the lightly doped
Kitaev liquid phase does not support quasiparticle states in the neighborhood
of $\Gamma$, and therefore yields a {\it non-Fermi liquid}, contrary to earlier
suggestions based on slave-boson studies. These observations are supported by

portion of the inner heliosphere by direct imaging in visible and radio
wavebands. White-light (WL) signatures of solar wind transients, such as CMEs,
result from Thomson scattering of sunlight by free electrons, and therefore
depend on both the viewing geometry and the electron density. The Faraday
rotation (FR) of radio waves from extragalactic pulsars and quasars, which
arises due to the presence of such solar wind features, depends on the
line-of-sight magnetic field component $B_\parallel$, and the electron density.
To understand coordinated WL and FR observations of CMEs, we perform forward
magnetohydrodynamic modelling of an Earth-directed shock and synthesise the
signatures that would be remotely sensed at a number of widely distributed
vantage points in the inner heliosphere. Removal of the background solar wind
contribution reveals the shock-associated enhancements in WL and FR. While the
efficiency of Thomson scattering depends on scattering angle, WL radiance $I$
decreases with heliocentric distance $r$ roughly according to the expression $I
\propto r^{-3}$. The sheath region downstream of the Earth-directed shock is
well viewed from the L4 and L5 Lagrangian points, demonstrating the benefits of
these points in terms of space weather forecasting. The spatial position of the
main scattering site $\mathbf{r}_{\rm sheath}$ and the mass of plasma at that
position $M_{\rm sheath}$ can be inferred from the polarisation of the
shock-associated enhancement in WL radiance. From the FR measurements, the
local $B_{\parallel {\rm sheath}}$ at $\mathbf{r}_{\rm sheath}$ can then be
estimated. Simultaneous observations in polarised WL and FR can not only be

process driven by a Brownian motion and accounts for the small variations. The
other factor is an OU process driven by a pure jump L\'evy process and models
the characteristic spikes observed in such markets. When it comes to pricing, a
popular choice of pricing measure is given by the Esscher transform that
preserves the probabilistic structure of the driving L\'evy processes, while
changing the levels of mean reversion. Using this choice one can generate
stochastic risk premiums (in geometric spot models) but with
(deterministically) changing sign. In this paper we introduce a pricing change
of measure, which is an extension of the Esscher transform. With this new
change of measure we also can slow down the speed of mean reversion and
generate stochastic risk premiums with stochastic non constant sign, even in
arithmetic spot models. In particular, we can generate risk profiles with
positive values in the short end of the forward curve and negative values in

reformulated and generalized for the graph setting. We show that modularity, a
standard quality function for graph clustering, does not satisfy all of these

Adaptive scale modularity has two parameters, which give greater flexibility in

functions, such as normalized cut and unnormalized cut, are obtained as special

their swimming speed, a geometric factor characterising the velocity field

ruptures. The venting gas inflates a blister on the surface of the shell. Here
we examine the growth of such blisters on the surfaces of wind-blown-bubbles
(WBBs) and supernova remnants (SNRs) due to shell rupture caused by the
Vishniac instability. On WBBs the maximum relative size of the blister
(R_bstall/R) is found to grow linearly with time, but in many cases the blister
radius will not exceed 20 per cent of the bubble radius. Thus blowouts
initiated by the Vishniac instability are unlikely to have a major effect on
the global dynamics and properties of the bubble. The relative size of blisters
on SNRs is even smaller than on WBBs, with blisters only growing to a radius
comparable to the thickness of the cold shell of SNRs. The small size of the
SNR blowouts is, however, in good agreement with observations of blisters in
the Vela SNR. The difference in relative size between WBB and SNR blisters is
due to the much higher speed at which gas vents out of WBBs, which translates
into a greater energy flux through a rupture of a given size from interior gas
of a given pressure. Larger blisters are possible if shell ruptures are bigger
than expected.
  We expect the observed velocity structure of SNR shells to be affected by the
presence of blisters until the shell is no longer susceptible to ruptures,
since the initial expansion of blisters is faster than the ongoing expansion of
the shell.

knowledge, the first such algorithm was proposed by Poloczek and Schnitger; Van
Zuylen subsequently gave an algorithm that set the probabilities differently
and had a simpler analysis. She also set up a framework for deriving such
algorithms. Buchbinder, Feldman, Naor, and Schwartz, as a special case of their
work on maximizing submodular functions, also give a randomized
3/4-approximation algorithm for MAX SAT with the same structure as these
previous algorithms. In this note we give a gloss on the Buchbinder et al.
algorithm that makes it even simpler, and show that in fact it is equivalent to
the previous algorithm of Van Zuylen. We also show how it extends to a
deterministic LP rounding algorithm; such an algorithm was also given by Van
Zuylen.

photometrically and combined with the latest spectral types. 1145 candidate hot
luminous stars were identified of which >700 were considered genuine early type
stars that contribute to feedback. We assess the spectroscopic completeness to
be 85% in outer regions (>5pc) but fall to 35% in the vicinity of R136, giving
a total of 500 hot luminous stars with spectroscopy. Stellar calibrations and
models were used to obtain their physical parameters before integrated values
were compared to global observations and the population synthesis code,
Starburst99. The 31 W-R and Of/WN stars made large contributions to the total
ionising and wind luminosities of ~40% and ~50%, respectively. Stars with
Minit>100Msun also showed high contributions to the global feedback, ~25% in
both cases. Such massive stars are not accounted for by the current Starburst99
code, which underestimated the ionising and wind luminosities of R136 by
factors of ~2 and ~9, respectively. The census inferred a SFR of
0.073+/-0.04Msun/yr for 30 Dor, typically higher than results from popular SFR
calibrations. However, it remained consistent with a far-UV luminosity tracer
and a combined Halpha and mid-infrared tracer, but only after correcting for
Halpha extinction. The global ionising output exceeded measurements from the
associated gas and dust, suggesting ~6(+55/-6)% of ionising photons escape the
region. When studying very luminous star forming regions, it is therefore
essential to include the most massive stars to ensure a reliable energy budget.
If 30 Dor is typical of other large star forming regions, estimates of the SFR
will be underpredicted if this escape fraction is not accounted for.(abridged)

transfer (e.g. due to long-range interactions) and rare self-interactions with
large momentum transfer (e.g. contact interactions), and find important

impose conservative bounds on the self-interaction cross-section. The majority
of both populations remain bound to the same gravitational potential and the
peaks of their distributions are therefore always coincident. Consequently any
apparent separation is mainly due to particles which are leaving the
gravitational potential, so will be largest shortly after the collision but not
observable in evolved systems. Nevertheless the fraction of collisions with
large momentum transfer is an important characteristic of self-interactions,
which can potentially be extracted from observational data and provide an

reasons in deep learning models, but in many cases they pose a challenging
problem: how to estimate the gradient of a loss function with respect to the
input of such stochastic or non-smooth neurons? I.e., can we ""back-propagate""
through these stochastic neurons? We examine this question, existing
approaches, and compare four families of solutions, applicable in different
settings. One of them is the minimum variance unbiased gradient estimator for
stochatic binary neurons (a special case of the REINFORCE algorithm). A second
approach, introduced here, decomposes the operation of a binary stochastic
neuron into a stochastic binary part and a smooth differentiable part, which
approximates the expected effect of the pure stochatic binary neuron to first
order. A third approach involves the injection of additive or multiplicative
noise in a computational graph that is otherwise differentiable. A fourth
approach heuristically copies the gradient with respect to the stochastic
output directly as an estimator of the gradient with respect to the sigmoid
argument (we call this the straight-through estimator). To explore a context
where these estimators are useful, we consider a small-scale version of {\em
conditional computation}, where sparse stochastic units form a distributed
representation of gaters that can turn off in combinatorially many ways large
chunks of the computation performed in the rest of the neural network. In this
case, it is important that the gating units produce an actual 0 most of the
time. The resulting sparsity can be potentially be exploited to greatly reduce
the computational cost of large deep networks for which conditional computation
would be useful.

$\mathcal{L}_1$ halo family when radiation pressure is introduced into the
Sun-Earth circular restricted three-body problem (CRTBP). This
photo-gravitational CRTBP can be used to model the motion of a solar sail
orientated perpendicular to the Sun-line. The problem is then parameterized by
the sail lightness number, the ratio of solar radiation pressure acceleration
to solar gravitational acceleration. Using boundary-value problem numerical
continuation methods and the AUTO software package (Doedel et al. 1991) the
families can be fully mapped out as the parameter $\beta$ is increased.
Interestingly, the emergence of a branch point in the retrograde satellite
family around the Earth at $\beta\approx0.0387$ acts to split the halo family
into two new families. As radiation pressure is further increased one of these
new families subsequently merges with another non-planar family at
$\beta\approx0.289$, resulting in a third new family. The linear stability of
the families changes rapidly at low values of $\beta$, with several small
regions of neutral stability appearing and disappearing. By using existing
methods within AUTO to continue branch points and period-doubling bifurcations,
and deriving a new boundary-value problem formulation to continue the folds and
Krein collisions, we track bifurcations and changes in the linear stability of
the families in the parameter $\beta$ and provide a comprehensive overview of
the halo family in the presence of radiation pressure. The results demonstrate
that even at small values of $\beta$ there is significant difference to the
classical CRTBP, providing opportunity for novel solar sail trajectories.
Further, we also find that the branch points between families in the solar sail
CRTBP provide a simple means of generating certain families in the classical
case.

approach is a probabilistic model that accommodates node, link and hybrid

scheme for hybrid communities is superior in revealing network characteristics.

We perform simulations of Milky Way-like galactic halo formation using a
standard LCDM cosmology and analyse the strength and distribution of the
subsequent evolving magnetic field. A dipole-shape divergence-free magnetic
field is injected at a rate of 10^{-9}G / Gyr within starforming regions, given
typical dimensions and magnetic field strengths in canonical SN remnants.
Subsequently, the magnetic field strength increases exponentially on timescales
of a few ten million years. At redshift z=0, the entire galactic halo is
magnetized and the field amplitude is of the order of a few $\mu$G in the
center of the halo, and 10^{-9} G at the virial radius. Additionally, we
analyse the intrinsic rotation measure (RM) of the forming galactic halo over
redshift. The mean halo intrinsic RM peaks between redshifts z=4 and z=2 and
reaches absolute values around 1000 rad m^{-2}. While the halo virializes
towards redshift z=0, the intrinsic RM values decline to a mean value below 10
rad m^{-2}. At high redshifts, the distribution of individual starforming, and
thus magnetized regions is widespread. In our model for the evolution of
galactic magnetic fields, the seed magnetic field amplitude and distribution is
no longer a free parameter, but determined self-consistently by the star

the observed, linearly polarized strong resonance lines in the solar spectrum
often requires the solution of the AD line transfer problems in one-dimensional
(1D) or multi-dimensional (multi-D) geometries. The purpose of this paper is to
develop an understanding of the relative importance of the AD PRD effects and
the multi-D transfer effects and particularly their combined influence on the
line polarization. This would help in a quantitative analysis of the second
solar spectrum (the linearly polarized spectrum of the Sun). We consider both
non-magnetic and magnetic media. In this paper we reduce the Stokes vector
transfer equation to a simpler form using a Fourier decomposition technique for
multi-D media. A fast numerical method is also devised to solve the concerned
multi-D transfer problem. The numerical results are presented for a
two-dimensional medium with a moderate optical thickness (effectively thin),
and are computed for a collisionless frequency redistribution. We show that the
AD PRD effects are significant, and can not be ignored in a quantitative fine
analysis of the line polarization. These effects are accentuated by the finite
dimensionality of the medium (multi-D transfer). The presence of magnetic
fields (Hanle effect) modifies the impact of these two effects to a
considerable extent.

between the J-PARC accelerator complex and the Super-Kamiokande detector.
Special emphasis is placed on measuring the mixing angle theta_13 by observing
electron neutrino appearance via the sub-dominant muon neutrino to electron
neutrino oscillation, and searching for CP violation in the lepton sector. The
experiment includes a sophisticated, off-axis, near detector, the ND280,
situated 280 m downstream of the neutrino production target in order to measure
the properties of the neutrino beam and to understand better neutrino
interactions at the energy scale below a few GeV. The data collected with the
ND280 are used to study charged- and neutral-current neutrino interaction rates
and kinematics prior to oscillation, in order to reduce uncertainties in the
oscillation measurements by the far detector. A key element of the near
detector is the ND280 electromagnetic calorimeter (ECal), consisting of active
scintillator bars sandwiched between lead sheets and read outwith multi-pixel
photon counters (MPPCs). The ECal is vital to the reconstruction of neutral
particles, and the identification of charged particle species. The ECal
surrounds the Pi-0 detector (P0D) and the tracking region of the ND280, and is
enclosed in the former UA1/NOMAD dipole magnet. This paper describes the
design, construction and assembly of the ECal, as well as the materials from
which it is composed. The electronic and data acquisition (DAQ) systems are
discussed, and performance of the ECal modules, as deduced from measurements
with particle beams, cosmic rays, the calibration system, and T2K data, is
described.

combinatorics of symbols are applied to animal communication studies to
estimate the communication's repertoire size. By using the conditional entropy
estimates at multiple orders, the paper estimates the total repertoire sizes
for animal communication across bottlenose dolphins, humpback whales, and
several species of birds for N-grams length one to three. In addition to
discussing the impact of this method on studies of animal communication
complexity, the reliability of these estimates is compared to other methods
through simulation. While entropy does undercount the total repertoire size due
to rare N-grams, it gives a more accurate picture of the most frequently used
repertoire than just repertoire size alone.

of Bayesian statistics. This epistemological perspective is illustrated using
some episodes in the history of chemistry concerning the definition or

consists of negative quantum probabilities which are considered to be
physically meaningless if not outright obsolete. Despite this annoying setback,
these negative probabilities are what led the great Paul Dirac in 1928 to the
esoteric discovery of the Dirac Equation. The Dirac Equation led to one of the
greatest advances in our understanding of the physical world. In this reading,
we ask the seemingly senseless question, ""Do negative probabilities exist in
quantum mechanics?"" In an effort to answer this question, we arrive at the
conclusion that depending on the choice one makes of the quantum probability
current, one will obtain negative probabilities. We thus propose a new quantum
probability current of the Klein-Gordon theory. This quantum probability
current leads directly to positive definite quantum probabilities. Because
these negative probabilities are in the bare Klein-Gordon theory, intrinsically
a result of negative energies, the fact that we here arrive at a theory with
positive probabilities, means that negative energy particles are not to be
considered problematic as is the case in the bare Klein-Gordon theory. From an
abstract-objective stand-point; in comparison with positive energy particles,
the corollary is that negative energy particles should have equal chances to
exist. As to why these negative energy particles do not exist, this is
analogous to asking why is it that Dirac's antimatter does not exist in equal
proportions with matter. This problem of why negative energy particles do not
exist in equal proportions with positive energy particles is a problem that
needs to be solved by a future theory.

toroidal and spherical topology. We are mainly interested in the case in which
the fermion is coupled non-trivially to an extra dimensional defect, with a

determine the behavior of a system. Having identified a number of variables
whose values can be accessed, there may still be hidden variables which
influence the dynamics of the system. The result is model ambiguity in the
sense that, for the same (or very similar) input values, different objective
outputs should have been obtained. In addition, the degree of ambiguity may
vary widely across the whole range of input values. Thus, to evaluate the
accuracy of a model it is of utmost importance to create a method to obtain the
degree of reliability of each output result. In this paper we present such a
scheme composed of two coupled artificial neural networks: the first one being
responsible for outputting the predicted value, whereas the other evaluates the
reliability of the output, which is learned from the error values of the first
one. As an illustration, the scheme is applied to a model for tracking slopes
in a straw chamber and to a credit scoring model.

domain is proposed. The method utilizes the multiresolution property of the
wavelet transform, which provides finer time resolution at the higher
frequencies than the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), to effectively
identify and remove impulse noise. It uses two features of speech to
discriminate speech from impulse noise: one is the slow time-varying nature of
speech and the other is the Lipschitz regularity of the speech components. On
the basis of these features, an algorithm has been developed to identify and
suppress wavelet coefficients that correspond to impulse noise. Experiment
results show that the new method is able to significantly reduce impulse noise
without degrading the quality of the speech signal or introducing any audible
artifacts.

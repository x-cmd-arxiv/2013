of such superflow. Although the experimentalists have recently retracted, very
publicly, some of the observations on which such a claim was based, other
confirming observations of which there is no reason for doubt remain on the

strongly favor the existence of supersolidity in the Bose-Hubbard model, and
these arguments would seem to extend to solid He. The true situation thus is
apparently extraordinarily opaque. The situation is complicated by the fact
that all accurate simulation studies on Heuse the uniform sign hypothesis which
confines them to the phase-coherent state, which is, in principle, supersolid,
so that no accurate simulations of the true, classical solid exist. There is
great confusion as to the nature of the ground state wave-function for a bose

comets discovered in the years 2006 - 2010 is studied.
  First, osculating orbits are obtained after a careful positional data
inspection and processing, including where appropriate, the method of data
partitioning for determination of pre- and post-perihelion orbit for tracking
then its dynamical evolution. The nongravitational acceleration in the motion
is detected for 50 per cent of investigated comets, in a few cases for the
first time. Different sets of nongravitational parameters are determined from
pre- and post-perihelion data for some of them. The influence of the positional
data structure on the possibility of the detection of nongravitational effects
and the overall precision of orbit determination is widely discussed.
  Secondly, both original and future orbits were derived by means of numerical
integration of swarms of virtual comets obtained using a Monte Carlo cloning
method. This method allows to follow the uncertainties of orbital elements at
each step of dynamical evolution. The complete statistics of original and
future orbits that includes significantly different uncertainties of 1/a-values
is presented, also in the light of our results obtained earlier. Basing on 108
comets examined by us so far, we conclude that only one of them, C/2007 W1
Boattini, seems to be a serious candidate for an interstellar comet. We also
found that 53 per cent of 108 near-parabolic comets escaping in the future from
the Solar system, and the number of comets leaving the Solar system as so
called Oort spike comets is 14 per cent.
  A new method for cometary orbit quality assessment is also proposed that
leads to a better diversification of orbit quality classes for contemporary
comets.

fundamental sources of uncertainty, namely, foreground contamination, thermal
noise and sample variance in detecting the HI power spectrum from the Epoch of
Reionization (EoR). We derive limits on the sensitivity of a Fourier synthesis
telescope to detect EoR based on its array configuration and a statistical
representation of images made by the instrument. We use the Murchison Widefield
Array (MWA) configuration for our studies. Using a unified framework for
estimating signal and noise components in the HI power spectrum, we derive an
expression for and estimate the contamination from extragalactic point-like
sources in three-dimensional k-space. Sensitivity for EoR HI power spectrum
detection is estimated for different observing modes with MWA. With 1000 hours
of observing on a single field using the 128-tile MWA, EoR detection is
feasible (S/N > 1 for $k\lesssim 0.8$ Mpc$^{-1}$). Bandpass shaping and
refinements to the EoR window are found to be effective in containing
foreground contamination, which makes the instrument tolerant to imaging
errors. We find that for a given observing time, observing many independent
fields of view does not offer an advantage over a single field observation when
thermal noise dominates over other uncertainties in the derived power spectrum.

hook lengths equal to n. We consider partitions that are simultaneously a-core
and b-core for two relatively prime integers a and b. These are related to
abacus diagrams and the combinatorics of the affine symmetric group (type A).
We observe that self-conjugate simultaneous core partitions correspond to the
combinatorics of type C, and use abacus diagrams to unite the discussion of
these two sets of objects.
  In particular, we prove that (2n)- and (2mn+1)-core partitions correspond
naturally to dominant alcoves in the m-Shi arrangement of type C_n,
generalizing a result of Fishel--Vazirani for type A. We also introduce a major
statistic on simultaneous n- and (n+1)-core partitions and on self-conjugate
simultaneous (2n)- and (2n+1)-core partitions that yield q-analogues of the
Coxeter-Catalan numbers of type A and type C.

simultaneous core partition, q-analogs of generalized Catalan numbers, and
generalizations to other Coxeter groups. We also discuss connections with the

they relate to the ponderomotive shift of a free electron in off-resonant
fields. We derive and evaluate corrections to the ponderomotive free electron
polarizability in the length and velocity (transverse or Coulomb) gauges, which
agree exactly as mandated by the gauge invariance. We also show how the free
electron value emerges from the Dirac equation through summation over the Dirac

expectation value of a term proportional to the square of the vector potential
in the velocity gauge. On the other hand, the same dominant contribution can be
obtained to first order via a series expansion of the exact energy shift from
the second order perturbation theory in the length gauge. Finally, we
numerically examine the validity of the free-electron approximation. The
correction to the free-electron value becomes smaller with increasing principal
quantum number, and it is well below a per cent for 60s states of Rb and Sr

their power demands for cost-effective operation taking into account three key
complex features exhibited by real-world electricity pricing schemes: (i)
time-varying prices (e.g., time-of-day pricing, spot pricing, or higher energy
prices during coincident peaks) and (ii) separate charge for peak power
consumption. Our focus is on demand modulation at the granularity of an entire
data center or a large part of it. For computational tractability reasons, we
work with a fluid model for power demands which we imagine can be modulated
using two abstract knobs of demand dropping and demand delaying (each with its
associated penalties or costs). Given many data center workloads and electric
prices can be effectively predicted using statistical modeling techniques, we
devise a stochastic dynamic program (SDP) that can leverage such predictive
models. Since the SDP can be computationally infeasible in many real platforms,
we devise approximations for it. We also devise fully online algorithms that
might be useful for scenarios with poor power demand or utility price
predictability. For one of our online algorithms, we prove a competitive ratio
of 2-1/n. Finally, using empirical evaluation with both real-world and
synthetic power demands and real-world prices, we demonstrate the efficacy of
our techniques. As two salient empirically-gained insights: (i) demand delaying
is more effective than demand dropping regarding to peak shaving (e.g., 10.74%
cost saving with only delaying vs. 1.45% with only dropping for Google
workload) and (ii) workloads tend to have different cost saving potential under
various electricity tariffs (e.g., 16.97% cost saving under peak-based tariff
vs. 1.55% under time-varying pricing tariff for Facebook workload).

measurements are sensitive to invariant masses between 70 GeV and 4.27 TeV with
center-of-mass jet rapidities up to 3.5. A novel technique to correct jets for
pile-up (additional proton-proton collisions) in the 2011 data is developed and
subsequently used in the measurement. The data are found to be consistent with
fixed-order NLO pQCD predictions provided by NLOJET++. The results constitute a
stringent test of pQCD, in an energy regime previously unexplored. The dijet
analysis is a confidence building step for the extraction of the signal of hard
double parton scattering (DPS) in four-jet events, and subsequent extraction of
the effective overlap area between the interacting protons, expressed in terms
of the variable, \sigma(eff). The measurement of DPS is performed using the
2010 ATLAS data. The rate of DPS events is estimated using a neural network. A
clear signal is observed, under the assumption that the DPS signal can be
represented by a random combination of exclusive dijet production. The fraction
of DPS candidate events is determined to be f(DPS) = 0.081 +- 0.004 (stat.)

where the dominant error is systematic arising from the details of the
deconvolution process. The resulting density distribution shows a highly
elongated bar with projected axis ratios ~(1:2.1) for isophotes reaching ~2kpc
along the major axis. Along the bar axes the density falls off roughly
exponentially, with axis ratios (10:6.3:2.6) and exponential scale-lengths
(0.70:0.44:0.18)kpc. From about 400pc above the Galactic plane, the bulge
density distribution displays a prominent X-structure. Overall, the density
distribution of the Galactic bulge is characteristic for a strongly boxy/peanut
shaped bulge within a barred galaxy.

gamma-rays coincided roughly with flaring states of the source, although we did
not find an exact correspondence between the VHE photon arrival times and the

PKS 0426-380 with daily bins revealed a significant spectral hardening around
the time of detection of the first VHE event (LAT photon index \Gamma\ $\simeq$

time of the second one. This combination implies a rather complex variability
pattern of the source in gamma rays during the flaring epochs. An additional
flat component is possibly present above several tens of GeV in the
EBL-corrected Fermi-LAT spectrum accumulated over the ~8-month high state.

parent stars during the T-Tauri or post-main-sequence phases of stellar
evolution. These outflows are often modelled to be isotropic, but this
assumption is not realistic for fast rotators, bipolar jets and supernovae.
Here we derive the general equations of motion for the time evolution of a
single planet, brown dwarf, comet or asteroid perturbed by anisotropic mass
loss in terms of a complete set of planetary orbital elements, the ejecta
velocity, and the parent star's co-latitude and longitude. We restrict our
application of these equations to 1) rapidly rotating giant stars, and 2)
arbitrarily-directed jet outflows. We conclude that the isotropic mass-loss
assumption can safely be used to model planetary motion during giant branch
phases of stellar evolution within distances of hundreds of au. In fact,
latitudinal mass loss variations anisotropically affect planetary motion only
if the mass loss is asymmetric about the stellar equator. Also, we demonstrate
how constant-velocity, asymmetric bipolar outflows in young systems incite
orbital inclination changes. Consequently, this phenomenon readily tilts
exoplanetary orbits external to a nascent disc on the order of degrees.

sub-DLAs is not noteworthy, photoionization models show that ionization effects
are important in a part of the absorbing gas of the sub-DLA at z_abs = 1.6359
(HI is 95 percent ionized) and in part of the gas of the sub-DLA at z_abs =

population properties derived from broad-band spectral energy distribution
fitting on the fitting parameters, e.g. SFHs, age grid, metallicity, IMF, dust
reddening, reddening law, filter setup and wavelength coverage. In this paper
we consider also redshift as a free parameter in the fit and study whether one
can obtain reasonable estimates of photometric redshifts and stellar population
properties at once. We use mock star-forming as well as passive galaxies placed
at various redshifts (0.5 to 3) as test particles. Mock star-forming galaxies
are extracted from a semi-analytical galaxy formation model. We show that for
high-z star-forming galaxies photometric redshifts, stellar masses and
reddening can be determined simultaneously when using a broad wavelength
coverage and a wide template setup in the fit. Masses are similarly well
recovered (median ~ 0.2 dex) as at fixed redshift. For old galaxies with little
recent star formation masses are better recovered than in the fixed redshift
case, such that the median recovered stellar mass improves by up to 0.3 dex
whereas the uncertainty in the redshift accuracy increases by only ~ 0.05.
However, a failure in redshift recovery also means a failure in mass recovery.
As at fixed redshift mismatches in SFH and degeneracies between age, dust and
now also redshift cause underestimated ages, overestimated reddening and
underestimated masses. Stellar masses are best determined at low redshift
without reddening in the fit (median underestimation ~ 0.1 dex for similarly
well recovered redshifts). Not surprisingly, the recovery of properties is
substantially better for passive galaxies. In all cases, the recovery of
physical parameters is crucially dependent on the wavelength coverage adopted
in the fitting. Scaling relations for the transformation of stellar masses are
provided.

the Solar System, the need for more general formulations with as few

and concise generalisations of two classic expansions of the three-body
disturbing function, simplifying considerably their original form and making
them accessible to the non-specialist. Governing the interaction between the
inner and outer orbits of a hierarchical triple, the disturbing function in its
general form is the conduit for energy and angular momentum exchange and as
such, governs the secular and resonant evolution of the system and its
stability characteristics. Focusing here on coplanar systems, the first
expansion is one in the ratio of inner to outer semimajor axes and is valid for
all eccentricities, while the second is an expansion in eccentricity and is
valid for all semimajor axis ratios [...]. Our generalizations make both
formulations valid for arbitrary mass ratios. [...]. We demonstrate the
equivalence of the new expansions, identifying the role of the spherical
harmonic order m in both and its physical significance in the three-body
problem, and introducing the concept of principal resonances. Several examples
of the accessibility of both expansions are given including resonance widths
and the secular rates of change of the elements. Results in their final form

Aims. Our purpose is to investigate flux and spectral variability on short and

source, guarantees large sample size statistics, and allows an unbiased view of
different activity states on weekly or daily time scales for the whole
timeframe and on nightly timescales for some epochs. Methods. Data were
obtained with the REM telescope located at the ESO premises of La Silla
(Chile). Light curves were gathered in the optical/near-infrared VRIJHK bands

The spectral energy distributions in general are well fitted by a power law,
with some deviations that are more apparent in low states. Some variability
episodes during a night interval are well documented for PKS 0537-441 and PKS
2155-304. For the latter source the variability time scale implies a large

Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) with energies up to the knee region. Recent
measurements of pion bumps in IC 443 and W 44 by Fermi-LAT show indirect
evidence of the acceleration of hadronic particles in SNRs. But, whether SNRs
are the powerhouses for GCR acceleration all the way up to the knee region
still remains an unsolved question. Tycho is a promising target for this study
because it has been widely studied in multi-wavelength observations from IR to
TeV and it is a young type Ia SNR located in a relatively clean environment.
Though recently developed models generally agree on the likely hadronic origin
of the gamma-ray emission from Tycho, the details of the models vary
considerably because the current data in the GeV-TeV range are weakly
constraining. Since the initial detection, VERITAS has increased its data size
by more than 40%. We also recently upgraded the telescope cameras and the
analysis packages, which will allow us to extend the measurements toward both
lower and higher energies. In this talk, I present updates on the VHE gamma-ray
measurements of Tycho with VERITAS, focusing on the interpretation of the
additional data in the context of hadronic GCR acceleration models.

loop is related to the loop's curvature by requiring that the Lorentz force
arising from this deviation is balanced by buoyancy. This equilibrium, coupled
with hydrostatic balance and the ideal gas law, then connects the temperature
of the loop with the curvature of the loop without resorting to a detailed
treatment of heating and cooling. We present two example solutions: one with a
spatially invariant magnetic Bond number (the dimensionless ratio of buoyancy
to Lorentz forces) and the other with a constant radius of curvature of the

test-particle simulations and different spiral potential models with parameters
constrained on observations, we verified the formation of a minimum with
amplitude ~ 30% - 40% of the background disk stellar density at corotation.
Such minimum is formed by the secular angular momentum transfer between stars
and the spiral density wave on both sides of corotation. We demonstrate that
the secular loss (gain) of angular momentum and decrease (increase) of mean
orbital radius of stars just inside (outside) corotation can counterbalance the
opposite trend of exchange of angular momentum shown by stars orbiting the
librational points L_4/5 at the corotation circle. Such secular processes
actually allow steady spiral waves to promote radial migration across
corotation. We propose some observational evidences for the minimum stellar
density in the Galactic disk, such as its direct relation to the minimum in the
observed rotation curve of the Galaxy at the radius R ~ 9 kpc (for R_0 = 7.5
kpc), as well as its association with a minimum in the distribution of Galactic
radii of a sample of open clusters older than 1 Gyr. The closeness of the solar
orbit radius to the corotation resonance implies that the solar orbit lies
inside a ring of minimum surface density (stellar + gas). This also implies in
a correction to larger values for the estimated total mass of the Galactic
disk, and consequently, a greater contribution of the disk component to the

gravity-darkened stellar disk. We simultaneously and self-consistently fit two
separate lightcurves observed in 2009 December and 2010 December. Our two
self-consistent fits yield M_p = 3.0 M_Jup and M_p = 3.6 M_Jup for assumed
stellar masses of M_* = 0.34 M_Sun and M_* = 0.44 M_Sun respectively. The two
fits have precession periods of 293 days and 581 days. These mass
determinations (consistent with previous upper limits) along with the strength
of the gravity-darkened precessing model together validate PTFO 8-8695b as just
the second Hot Jupiter known to orbit an M-dwarf. Our fits show a high degree
of spin-orbit misalignment in the PTFO 8-8695 system: 69 +/- 2 or 73.1 +/- 0.5
degrees, in the two cases. The large misalignment is consistent with the
hypothesis that planets become Hot Jupiters with random orbital plane
alignments early in a system's lifetime. We predict that as a result of the
highly misaligned, precessing system, the transits should disappear for months
at a time over the course of the system's precession period. The precessing,
gravity-darkened model also predicts other observable effects: changing orbit
inclination that could be detected by radial velocity observations, changing
stellar inclination that would manifest as varying v sin i, changing projected
spin-orbit alignment that could be seen by the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect,
changing transit shapes over the course of the precession, and differing
lightcurves as a function of wavelength. Our measured planet radii of 1.64

in spaces conferring enough regularity, we prove the existence of a compact
absorbing set for the dynamics in $H^1$, obtain the compactness of the

energetics of this most extreme phenomenon and its relationship to the
accretion state. The second is to verify if the calibrated estimates of the
energy of major radio flares (based on the peak low frequency optically thin
flux) derived from flares in the period 1996-2001 in Punsly & Rodriguez (2013),
PR13 hereafter, can be used to estimate plasmoid energy beyond this time
period. We find evidence that the calibrated curves are still accurate for this
strong flare. Furthermore, the physically important findings of PR13 are
supported by the inclusion of this flare: the flare energy is correlated with
both the intrinsic bolometric X-ray luminosity, $L_{\mathrm{bol}}$, $\sim 1$
hour before ejection and $L_{\mathrm{bol}}$ averaged over the duration of the
ejection of the plasmoid and $L_{\mathrm{bol}}$ is highly elevated relative to
historic levels just before and during the ejection episode. A search of the

distinct outcomes depending on the mass of the embedded planet. In the presence
of a low mass planet ($8 M_{\oplus}$), two narrow gaps start to open in the gas
on each side of the planet where the density waves shock. These shallow gaps
can dramatically affect particle drift speed and cause significant, roughly
axisymmetric dust depletion. On the other hand, a more massive planet ($>0.1
M_{J}$) carves out a deeper gap with sharp edges, which are unstable to the
vortex formation. Particles with a wide range of sizes ($0.02<\Omega t_{s}<20$)
are trapped and settle to the midplane in the vortex, with the strongest
concentration for particles with $\Omega t_{s}\sim 1$. The dust concentration
is highly elongated in the $\phi$ direction, and can be as wide as 4 disk scale
heights in the radial direction. Dust surface density inside the vortex can be
increased by more than a factor of 10$^2$ in a very non-axisymmetric fashion.
For very big particles ($\Omega t_{s}\gg 1$) we find strong eccentricity
excitation, in particular around the planet and in the vicinity of the mean
motion resonances, facilitating gap opening there. Our results imply that in
weakly turbulent protoplanetary disk regions (e.g. the ""dead zone"") dust
particles with a very wide range of sizes can be trapped at gap edges and
inside vortices induced by planets with $M_{p}<M_{J}$, potentially accelerating
planetesimal and planet formation there, and giving rise to distinctive

We first characterize the all stabilizing loop-filters for a linearized

lowpass, bandpass, and multi-band modulators as minimization of the maximum
magnitude of the noise transfer function (NTF) in fixed frequency band(s). We
show that this optimization minimizes the worst-case reconstruction error, and
hence improves the SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) of the modulator. The
optimization is reduced to an optimization with a linear matrix inequality
(LMI) via the generalized KYP (Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov) lemma. The obtained NTF
is an FIR (finite-impulse-response) filter, which is favorable in view of
implementation. We also derive a stability condition for the nonlinear model of
delta-sigma modulators with general quantizers including uniform ones. This
condition is described as an H-infinity norm condition, which is reduced to an
LMI via the KYP lemma. Design examples show advantages of our design.

immunization strategy is that we take into account the possibility of serious
side effects. Uniform immunization refers to a situation in which banks are
""vaccinated"" with a common low-risk asset. The riskiness of immunized banks
will decrease significantly, but the level of systemic risk may increase due to
the de-diversification effect. To overcome this side effect, we propose another
immunization strategy, counteractive immunization, which prevents pairs of
banks from failing simultaneously. We find that counteractive immunization can

species-area relationship (SAR) that can be fully characterized using only the
total abundance (N) and species richness (S) at a single spatial scale. This
theory has shown promise for characterizing scale dependence in the SAR.
However, there are currently four different approaches to applying METE to
predict the SAR and it is unclear which approach should be used due to a lack
of empirical evaluation. Specifically, METE can be applied recursively or a
non-recursively and can use either a theoretical or observed species-abundance
distribution (SAD). We compared the four different combinations of approaches
using empirical data from 16 datasets containing over 1000 species and 300,000
individual trees and herbs. In general, METE accurately downscaled the SAR
(R^2> 0.94), but the recursive approach consistently under-predicted richness,
and METEs accuracy did not depend strongly on using the observed or predicted
SAD. This suggests that best approach to scaling diversity using METE is to use
a combination of non-recursive scaling and the theoretical abundance
distribution, which allows predictions to be made across a broad range of
spatial scales with only knowledge of the species richness and total abundance
at a single scale.

Asynchronous, incremental modification of the pages, as performed by Ajax

  FORWARD belongs to a novel family of web application frameworks that attack
impedance mismatch by offering a single unifying language. FORWARD's language
is SQL++, a minimally extended SQL. FORWARD's architecture is based on two
novel cornerstones: (a) A Unified Application State (UAS), which is a virtual
database over the multiple data sources. The UAS is accessed via distributed
SQL++ queries, therefore resolving the distributed data access problem. (b)
Declarative page specifications, which treat the data displayed by pages as
rendered SQL++ page queries. The resulting pages are automatically
incrementally modified by FORWARD. User input on the page becomes part of the
UAS.
  We show that SQL++ captures the semi-structured nature of web pages and
subsumes the data models of two important data sources of the UAS: SQL
databases and JavaScript components. We show that simple markup is sufficient
for creating Ajax displays and for modeling user input on the page as UAS data
sources. Finally, we discuss the page specification syntax and semantics that
are needed in order to avoid race conditions and conflicts between the user
input and the automated Ajax page modifications.

is capable to mitigate the manual labeling effort which is usually expensive
and time-consuming. However, there was a long-term debate on the effectiveness
of unlabeled data in text classification. This was partially caused by the fact
that many assumptions in theoretic analysis often do not hold in practice. We
argue that this problem may be further understood by adding an additional
dimension in the experiment. This allows us to address this problem in the
perspective of bias and variance in a broader view. We show that the well-known
performance degradation issue caused by unlabeled data can be reproduced as a

to be better balanced by a more effective feature selection method unlabeled
data is very likely to boost the classification performance. We then propose a
feature selection framework in which labeled and unlabeled training samples are
both considered. We discuss its potential in achieving such a balance. Besides,
the application in financial sentiment analysis is chosen because it not only
exemplifies an important application, the data possesses better illustrative
power as well. The implications of this study in text classification and

integrated luminosity two orders of magnitude greater than KEKB. The new
international collaboration at SuperKEKB is called Belle II. The first data
from Belle II/SuperKEKB is expected in 2015.
  In October 2012, senior members of the Belle II collaboration gathered at
PNNL to discuss the computing and networking requirements of the Belle II
experiment with ESnet staff and other computing and networking experts. The
day-and-a-half-long workshop characterized the instruments and facilities used
in the experiment, the process of science for Belle II, and the computing and
networking equipment and configuration requirements to realize the full
scientific potential of the collaboration's work.
  The requirements identified at the Belle II Experiment Requirements workshop
are summarized in this report.

applications that range from indoor deployment scenarios in home and office to
outdoor deployment in adversary's territory in tactical battleground. Since in
many WSN applications, lives and livelihoods may depend on the timeliness and
correctness of sensor data obtained from dispersed sensor nodes, these networks
must be secured to prevent any possible attacks that may be launched on them.
Security is, therefore, an important issue in WSNs. However, this issue becomes
even more critical in cognitive wireless sensor networks, a type of WSN in
which the sensor nodes have the capabilities of changing their transmission and
reception parameters according to the radio environment under which they
operate in order to achieve reliable and efficient communication and optimum
utilization of the network resources. This survey paper presents a
comprehensive discussion on various security issues in CWSNs by identifying
numerous security threats in these networks and defense mechanisms to counter
these vulnerabilities. Various types of attacks on CWSNs are categorized under
different classes based on their natures and tragets, and corresponding to each
attack class, appropriate security mechanisms are presented. The paper also
identifies some open problems in this emerging area of wireless networking.

called global level of qualification leads to better performance of the

an energy efficient network model. We develop an algorithm to calculate energy

single electron. Superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), which
were traditionally the most sensitive magnetometers, could not hitherto reach
this goal because of their relatively large effective size (of the order of 1
{\mu}m). Here we report self-aligned fabrication of nano-SQUIDs with diameters
as small as 46 nm and with an extremely low flux noise of 50 n{\Phi}0/Hz^1/2,
representing almost two orders of magnitude improvement in spin sensitivity,
down to 0.38 {\mu}B/Hz^1/2. In addition, the devices operate over a wide range
of magnetic fields with 0.6 {\mu}B/Hz^1/2 sensitivity even at 1 T. We
demonstrate magnetic imaging of vortices in type II superconductor that are 120
nm apart and scanning measurements of AC magnetic fields down to 50 nT. The
unique geometry of these nano-SQUIDs that reside on the apex of a sharp tip
allows approaching the sample to within a few nm, which paves the way to a new
class of single-spin resolved scanning probe microscopy.

small complexes and assemblies, to local nano- and micro-clusters, to global,

behavior. We propose a new view of the spatial structure of cell signaling
systems. This new view describes cell signaling in terms of dynamic allosteric
interactions within and among distinct, spatially organized transient clusters.
The clusters vary over time and space and are on length scales from nanometers
to micrometers. When considered across these length-scales, primary factors in
the spatial organization are cell membrane domains and the actin cytoskeleton,
both also highly dynamic. A key challenge is to understand the interplay across
these multiple scales, link it to the physicochemical basis of the
conformational behavior of single molecules, and ultimately relate it to
cellular function. Overall, our premise is that at these scales, cell signaling
should be thought of not primarily as a sequence of diffusion-controlled
molecular collisions, but instead transient, allostery-driven cluster
re-forming interactions.

holomorphic functions are derived. Among applications, we derive sharp
dimension estimates (with rigidity) of holomorphic functions with polynomial
growth when the holomorphic sectional curvature is nonnegative. When the
bisectional curvature is nonnegative, this was due to Ni. Also we study
holomorphic functions with polynomial growth near infinity. On a complete
noncompact K\""ahler manifold with nonnegative bisectional curvature, we prove
any holomorphic function with polynomial growth is homogenous at infinity. This
result is closely related with Yau's conjecture on the finite generation of
holomorphic functions (see page $3-4$ for detailed explanation).
  We also generalize the three circle theorem to K\""ahler manifolds with
holomorphic sectional curvature lower bound. These inequalities are sharp in
general. As applications, we establish sharp dimension estimates for
holomorphic functions with certain growth conditions when the holomorphic
sectional curvature is asymptotically nonnegative.

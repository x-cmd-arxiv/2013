in the solar atmosphere, the solution of polarized radiative transfer (RT)
equation in multi-dimensional (multi-D) geometries is essential. For strong
resonance lines partial frequency redistribution (PRD) effects also become
important. In a series of papers we have been investigating the nature of
Stokes profiles formed in multi-D media including PRD in line scattering. For
numerical simplicity so far we restricted our attention to the particular case
of PRD functions which are averaged over all the incident and scattered
directions. In this paper we formulate the polarized RT equation in multi-D
media that takes into account Hanle effect with angle-dependent PRD functions.
We generalize here to the multi-D case, the method of Fourier series expansion
of angle-dependent PRD functions originally developed for RT in 1D geometry. We
show that the Stokes source vector $\bm{S}=(S_I,S_Q,S_U)^T$ and the Stokes
vector $\bm{I}=(I,Q,U)^T$ can be expanded in terms of infinite sets of
components ${\tilde{\bm{\mathcal{S}}}}^{(k)}$,
${\tilde{\bm{\mathcal{I}}}}^{(k)}$ respectively, $k\in[0,+\infty)$. We show
that the components ${\tilde{\bm{\mathcal{S}}}}^{(k)}$ become independent of
the azimuthal angle ($\varphi$) of the scattered ray, whereas the components
${\tilde{\bm{\mathcal{I}}}}^{(k)}$ remain dependent on $\varphi$ due to the
nature of RT in multi-D geometry. We also establish that
${\tilde{\bm{\mathcal{S}}}}^{(k)}$ and ${\tilde{\bm{\mathcal{I}}}}^{(k)}$
satisfy a simple transfer equation, which can be solved by any iterative method
like an Approximate Lambda Iteration (ALI) or a Biconjugate-Gradient type
projection method provided we truncate the Fourier series to have a finite
number of terms.

decay modes to final states with pairs of charged pions or kaons, including
$B_s \to \pi^+K^-$ and $B_s\to K^+K^-$ for which asymmetries have been reported
recently by the LHCb collaboration. After reviewing the current status of these

$B_s \to \pi^+K^-$ and $B^0\to K^+\pi^-$, we perform a perturbative study of
U-spin breaking corrections, searching for relations for combined asymmetries

two-body decays involving a neutral kaon, and in three-body $B^+$ decays to

theories of the quantum realm. This paper presents a new derivation of the
inequalities from non-trivial non-local theories and formulates a stronger Bell
argument excluding also these non-local theories. Taking into account all
possible theories, the conclusion of this stronger argument provably is the
strongest possible consequence from the violation of Bell inequalities on a
qualitative probabilistic level (given usual background assumptions). Among the
forbidden theories is a subset of outcome dependent theories showing that
outcome dependence is not sufficient for explaining a violation of Bell
inequalities. Non-local theories which can violate Bell inequalities (among
them quantum theory) are rather characterised by the fact that at least one of
the measurement outcomes in some sense (which is made precise)
probabilistically depends both on its local as well as on its distant
measurement setting ('parameter'). When Bell inequalities are found to be
violated, the true choice is not 'outcome dependence or parameter dependence'
but between two kinds of parameter dependences, one of them being what is
usually called 'parameter dependence'. Against the received view established by
Jarrett and Shimony that on a probabilistic level quantum non-locality amounts
to outcome dependence, this result confirms and makes precise Maudlin's claim
that some kind of parameter dependence is required.

automatic transversality phenomenon which uses Hofer geometry to conclude
transversality and may be useful in other contexts. Strangely the monotone

necessary for the virtual moduli cycle, decouple us from underlying Hofer

data outsourcing raises serious security concerns for preserving data

while supporting search on the data stored in outsourced environments. However,
such solutions do not support access policies to regulate access to a
particular subset of the stored data.
  For complex user management, large enterprises employ Role-Based Access

squark signals thus far at the LHC both point towards a mini-split spectrum for
supersymmetry. Within standard paradigms, it is non-trivial to realize a
mini-split spectrum with heavier sfermions but lighter gauginos while
simultaneously generating Higgs sector soft terms of the correct magnitude,
suggesting the need for new models of supersymmetry breaking and mediation. In
this paper, we present a new approach to mini-split model building based on
gauge mediation by ``auxiliary groups'', which are the anomaly-free continuous
symmetries of the standard model in the limit of vanishing Yukawa couplings. In
addition to the well-known flavor SU(3)_F and baryon-minus-lepton U(1)_{B-L}
groups, we find that an additional U(1)_H acting on the Higgs doublets alone
can be used to generate Higgs soft masses and B-terms necessary for a complete
model of mini-split. Auxiliary gauge mediation is a special case of Higgsed
gauge mediation, and we review the resulting two-loop scalar soft terms as well
as three-loop gaugino masses. Along the way, we present a complete two-loop
calculation of A-terms and B-terms in gauge mediation, which---contrary to a
common misconception---includes a non-zero contribution at the messenger
threshold which can be sizable in models with light gauginos. We present
several phenomenologically acceptable mini-split spectra arising from auxiliary
gauge mediation and highlight a complete minimal model which realizes the
required spectrum and Higgs sector soft terms with a single U(1)_X auxiliary
gauge symmetry. We discuss possible experimental consequences.

effect of the Galileon field on the large-scale matter clustering. The
algorithm is tested for several matter field configurations with different
symmetries, and works very well. This enables us to perform the first
simulations for a quartic Galileon model which provides a good fit to the
cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy, supernovae and baryonic acoustic
oscillations (BAO) data. Our result shows that the Vainshtein mechanism in this
model is very efficient in suppressing the spatial variations of the scalar
field. However, the time variation of the effective Newtonian constant caused
by the curvature coupling of the Galileon field cannot be suppressed by the
Vainshtein mechanism. This leads to a significant weakening of the strength of
gravity in high-density regions at late times, and therefore a weaker matter
clustering on small scales. We also find that without the Vainshtein mechanism
the model would have behaved in a completely different way, which shows the
crucial role played by nonlinearities in modified gravity theories and the
importance of performing self-consistent N-body simulations for these theories.

galaxies within the picture of active galactic nuclei (AGN) has been
controversial. It is still not clear whether they host an AGN in a low
accretion mode, or whether they are not active at all but dominated by
alternative ionization mechanisms, namely shocks, winds/outflows, or
photoionization by a post asymptotic giant branch (p-AGB) stellar population.
The detection of extended LINER-like emission was often taken as evidence of
ionization by stellar components but this has not been undisputed. We performed
optical integral field spectroscopic observations on the central approx. 4 kpc
of NGC 5850 using VIMOS at the VLT, which provides spatially-resolved spectra
for the gas emission and the stellar continuum. We derive and analyse emission
line and kinematic maps. We find the central few kpc of NGC 5850 to be
dominated by extended LINER-like emission. The emission-line ratios that are
sensitive to the ionization parameter increase with radial distance to the
nucleus. Therefore, the extended LINER-like emission in NGC 5850 is dominated
by ionization from distributed ionization sources, probably by stars on the
p-AGB. The LINER-like region is surrounded by emission that is classed as
'composite', likely due to a mixture of a LINER-like ionization pattern and
photoionization by low-level star formation. Two star-forming regions are
present in the 21""x19"" field of view. One of them is located approximately in
the ring surrounding the kinematically decoupled core. The second one is close
to the nucleus and is the origin of a region of decreased emission line ratios
oriented radially outwards. We find the interstellar gas to have areas of steep
velocity gradients and a complex kinematic morphology, probably caused by the
lopsided (m=1) distribution of the gas. The inflow of gas toward the center
appears possible.

quantifying a galaxy's dynamical history; however, automatic classifications of
morphology (either by computer analysis of images or by using other physical
parameters as proxies) still have drawbacks when compared to visual inspection.
The large number of images available in current surveys makes visual inspection
of each galaxy impractical for individual astronomers. GZ2 uses classifications
from volunteer citizen scientists to measure morphologies for all galaxies in
the DR7 Legacy survey with m_r>17, in addition to deeper images from SDSS
Stripe 82. While the original Galaxy Zoo project identified galaxies as
early-types, late-types, or mergers, GZ2 measures finer morphological features.
These include bars, bulges, and the shapes of edge-on disks, as well as
quantifying the relative strengths of galactic bulges and spiral arms. This
paper presents the full public data release for the project, including measures
of accuracy and bias. The majority (>90%) of GZ2 classifications agree with
those made by professional astronomers, especially for morphological T-types,
strong bars, and arm curvature. Both the raw and reduced data products can be

delocalization of about 10-2 electron from the HAT6 core to TNF is deduced from
both Raman and our previous NMR measurements (Reference 32), implying the
presence of permanent dipoles at the donor-acceptor interface. A combined
analysis of density functional theory calculations, resonant Raman and UV-VIS
absorption measurements indicate that fast relaxation occurs in the UV region
due to intramolecular vibronic coupling of HAT6 quinoidal modes with lower
lying electronic states. Relatively slower relaxation in the visible region
CT-band of the complex is also indicated, which likely involves motions of the
TNF nitro groups. The fast quinoidal relaxation process in the hot UV band of
HAT6 relates to pseudo-Jahn-Teller interactions in a single benzene unit,
suggesting that the underlying vibronic coupling mechanism can be generic for
polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Both the presence of CT dipoles and relatively slow
relaxation processes in the CT band can be relevant concerning the design of
DLC based organic PV systems.

the galaxy formation process in the LCDM (Lambda Cold Dark Matter) hierarchical
cosmological model. These galaxies are believed to be the most dark matter (DM)
dominated systems known, have the lowest stellar content, and are poor in gas.
Many theories attempt to explain the formation of dSph galaxies resorting to
the fact that these galaxies are mainly found orbiting large galaxies or
invoking other mechanisms of interactions. Here we show the full set of
simulation as an extension of our fiducial model, where we study the formation
of classical dSph galaxies in isolation by dissolving star clusters within the
DM halo of the dwarf galaxy. In our parameter survey we adopt cored and cusped
DM halo profiles and consider different numbers of dissolving star clusters. We
investigate the dependency of observable quantities with different masses and
scale-lengths of the DM halo and different star formation efficiencies (SFE).
We find that our proposed scenario explains many features of the classical dSph
galaxies of the Milky Way, like their morphology and their dynamics. We see
trends how the surface brightness and the scale-length of the luminous
component vary with the parameters of our simulations. We also identify how
irregularities in their shape, i.e. clumpiness and ellipticity vary in our
simulations. In velocity space, we identify the parameters leading to flat
velocity dispersions curves. We recognize kinematically cold substructures in
velocity space, named fossil remnants and stemming from our unique initial
conditions, which alter the expected results. These streaming motions are
considered as a key feature for future observation with high resolution to
validate our scenario.

can contain metastable vortex solutions. These vortices contain the true vacuum
inside in addition to a unit of magnetic flux and the appropriate topologically
nontrivial false vacuum outside. We numerically establish the existence of
vortex solutions which are classically stable; however, they can decay via
tunneling. In general terms, they tunnel to a configuration which is a large,
thin-walled vortex configuration that is now classically unstable to the

search strategy substantially outperforms the best existing algorithms in terms
of final scores of the objective function; for description length, its
performance is on par with the original Infomap algorithm. The execution time
of our algorithm is on par with non-greedy alternatives present in literature,
and networks of up to 10,000 nodes can be analyzed in time spans ranging from
minutes to a few hours on average workstations, making our approach readily
applicable to tasks which require the quality of partitioning to be as high as
possible, and are not limited by strict time constraints. Finally, based on the
most effective of the available optimization techniques, we compare the
performance of modularity and code length as objective functions, in terms of
the quality of the partitions one can achieve by optimizing them. To this end,
we evaluated the ability of each objective function to reconstruct the
underlying structure of a large set of synthetic and real-world networks.

"1308.3509","Andrew Cotter","Andrew Cotter","Stochastic Optimization for Machine Learning","PhD Thesis",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It has been found that stochastic algorithms often find good solutions much
more rapidly than inherently-batch approaches. Indeed, a very useful rule of
thumb is that often, when solving a machine learning problem, an iterative
technique which relies on performing a very large number of
relatively-inexpensive updates will often outperform one which performs a
smaller number of much ""smarter"" but computationally-expensive updates.
  In this thesis, we will consider the application of stochastic algorithms to
two of the most important machine learning problems. Part i is concerned with
the supervised problem of binary classification using kernelized linear
classifiers, for which the data have labels belonging to exactly two classes
(e.g. ""has cancer"" or ""doesn't have cancer""), and the learning problem is to
find a linear classifier which is best at predicting the label. In Part ii, we
will consider the unsupervised problem of Principal Component Analysis, for
which the learning task is to find the directions which contain most of the
variance of the data distribution.
  Our goal is to present stochastic algorithms for both problems which are,
above all, practical--they work well on real-world data, in some cases better
than all known competing algorithms. A secondary, but still very important,
goal is to derive theoretical bounds on the performance of these algorithms
which are at least competitive with, and often better than, those known for
other approaches.

V.I.Arnold in 1978. Let $f: \mathbb R/\mathbb Z \to \mathbb R/\mathbb Z$ be an
orientation preserving circle diffeomorphism and let $\omega \in \mathbb
C/\mathbb Z$ be a parameter with positive imaginary part. Construct a complex
torus by glueing the two boundary components of the annulus $\{z \in \mathbb
C/\mathbb Z \mid 0< \Im(z)< \Im({\omega})\}$ via the map $f+{\omega}$. This
complex torus is isomorphic to $\mathbb C/(\mathbb Z+{\tau} \mathbb Z)$ for
some appropriate ${\tau} \in \mathbb C/\mathbb Z$.
  According to Moldavskis (2001), if the ordinary rotation number
$\operatorname{rot} (f+\omega_0)$ is Diophantine and if ${\omega}$ tends to
$\omega_0$ non tangentially to the real axis, then ${\tau}$ tends to
$\operatorname{rot} (f+\omega_0)$. We show that the Diophantine and non
tangential assumptions are unnecessary: if $\operatorname{rot} (f+\omega_0)$ is
irrational then ${\tau}$ tends to $\operatorname{rot} (f+\omega_0)$ as
${\omega}$ tends to $\omega_0$.
  This, together with results of N.Goncharuk (2012), motivates us to introduce
a new fractal set, given by the limit values of ${\tau}$ as ${\omega}$ tends to
the real axis. For the rational values of $\operatorname{rot} (f+\omega_0)$,
these limits do not necessarily coincide with $\operatorname{rot} (f+\omega_0)$
and form a countable number of analytic loops in the upper half-plane.

conservative since it simply requires that the expected dark matter signal does
not exceed the observed emission. The constraints obtained in the likely case
that the collapse of baryons to the Galactic Center is accompanied by the
contraction of the dark matter are strong. In particular, we find that for bb

the annihilation cross section imply that the thermal cross section is excluded
for a Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) mass smaller than about 700

inverse Compton scattering is important, depending on models of the Galactic
magnetic field the exclusion of the thermal cross-section is for a WIMP mass
smaller than about 150 to 400 GeV. The upper limits on the annihilation cross

under high-order resonance conditions and then exploit the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation to understand the dynamical evolution. It is found that the
existence of a flat-band (or an effectively flat-band) is one important feature
behind why and how the exponential dynamics emerges. It is also found that a
quantitative prediction of the exponential spreading rate based on an
interesting and simple pseudoclassical map may be inaccurate. In addition to
general interests regarding the question of how exponential behavior in quantum
systems may persist for a long time scale, our results should motivate further
studies towards a better understanding of high-order resonance behavior in
delta-kicked quantum systems.

are centrally kinematically disk-like. Hence, while global morphology suggests
that ellipticals are ellipsoidal/triaxial in shape, their central kinematics
may be consistent with (inclined) oblate systems.
  Here we study the Fast Rotator elliptical galaxy: NGC 4473. Using slitlets,
we obtain galaxy light kinematics out to unprecedentedly large galactocentric
radii (2.5 effective radii). While we confirm the IFU results in the central
regions, we find that at large galactocentric radii NGC 4473 exhibits a
kinematic transition. In the outskirts, we observe clear minor and major axis
rotation, a tell-tale sign of triaxiality, which agrees well with the galaxy's
Hubble type.

simulations of galaxy formation, and in this system contains around one-third
of the stellar light. While this galaxy may be a special case, it suggests
further investigation of the outskirts of galaxies is needed to confirm the new

low-dimensional space of stimulus features that affect a neuron's probability
of spiking. One popular method, known as maximally informative dimensions
(MID), uses an information-theoretic quantity known as ""single-spike
information"" to identify this space. Here we examine MID from a model-based
perspective. We show that MID is a maximum-likelihood estimator for the
parameters of a linear-nonlinear-Poisson (LNP) model, and that the empirical
single-spike information corresponds to the normalized log-likelihood under a
Poisson model. This equivalence implies that MID does not necessarily find
maximally informative stimulus dimensions when spiking is not well described as
Poisson. We provide several examples to illustrate this shortcoming, and derive
a lower bound on the information lost when spiking is Bernoulli in discrete
time bins. To overcome this limitation, we introduce model-based dimensionality
reduction methods for neurons with non-Poisson firing statistics, and show that
they can be framed equivalently in likelihood-based or information-theoretic
terms. Finally, we show how to overcome practical limitations on the number of
stimulus dimensions that MID can estimate by constraining the form of the
non-parametric nonlinearity in an LNP model. We illustrate these methods with
simulations and data from primate visual cortex.

observed prompt emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In order to produce the
observed non-thermal spectra, some kind of dissipation mechanism near the
photosphere is required. In this paper we numerically simulate the evolution of
the photon spectrum in a relativistically expanding shell with a time-dependent
numerical code. We consider two basic models. One is a leptonic model, where a
dissipation mechanism heats the thermal electrons maintaining their high
temperature. The other model involves a cascade process induced by
$pp$($pn$)-collisions which produce high-energy electrons, modify the thermal
spectrum, and emit neutrinos. The qualitative properties of the photon spectra
are mainly determined by the optical depth at which the dissipation mechanism
sets in. Too large optical depths lead to a broad and curved spectrum
contradicting the observations, while for optical depths smaller than unity the
spectral hardness becomes softer than observed. A significant shift of the
spectral peak energy to higher energies due to a large energy injection can
lead to an overly broad spectral shape. We show ideal parameter ranges for
which these models are able to reproduce the observed spectra. For the
$pn$-collision model, the neutrino fluence in the 10-100 GeV range is well
above the atmospheric neutrino fluence, but its detection is challenging for
presently available detectors.

predicting gravitational waveforms within any given physical model. The method
is relevant for both real-time applications and in more traditional scenarios
where the generation of waveforms using standard methods can be prohibitively
expensive. Our approach is based on three offline steps resulting in an
accurate reduced-order model that can be used as a surrogate for the
true/fiducial waveform family. First, a set of m parameter values is determined
using a greedy algorithm from which a reduced basis representation is
constructed. Second, these m parameters induce the selection of m time values
for interpolating a waveform time series using an empirical interpolant. Third,
a fit in the parameter dimension is performed for the waveform's value at each
of these m times. The cost of predicting L waveform time samples for a generic
parameter choice is of order m L + m c_f online operations where c_f denotes
the fitting function operation count and, typically, m << L. We generate
accurate surrogate models for Effective One Body (EOB) waveforms of
non-spinning binary black hole coalescences with durations as long as 10^5 M,
mass ratios from 1 to 10, and for multiple harmonic modes. We find that these
surrogates are three orders of magnitude faster to evaluate as compared to the
cost of generating EOB waveforms in standard ways. Surrogate model building for
other waveform models follow the same steps and have the same low online
scaling cost. For expensive numerical simulations of binary black hole
coalescences we thus anticipate large speedups in generating new waveforms with
a surrogate. As waveform generation is one of the dominant costs in parameter
estimation algorithms and parameter space exploration, surrogate models offer a
new and practical way to dramatically accelerate such studies without impacting
accuracy.

coordinates. The underlying assumption is that electrons are in their
quantum-mechanical ground state or in thermal equilibrium. However, there is an
abundance of cases where this is unjustified because the system is only locally
in equilibrium. In particular, the fractional charges of atoms, clusters, or
solids tend to not only depend on atomic positions but also on how the system
reached its state. For example, the charge of an isolated solid -- and thus the
forces between atoms in that solid -- usually depends on the counterbody with
which it has last formed contact. Similarly, the charge of an atom, resulting
from the dissociation of a molecule, can differ for different solvents in which
the dissociation took place. In this paper we demonstrate that such
charge-transfer history effects can be accounted for by assigning discrete
oxidation states to atoms. With our method, an atom can donate an integer
charge to another, nearby atom to change its oxidation state as in a redox
reaction. In addition to integer charges, atoms can exchange ""partial charges""
which are determined with the split charge equilibration method.

School on Topology and Field Theories held at the Center for Mathematics at the
University of Notre Dame, Indiana during the Summer of 2012. A similar lecture
series was given in Hamburg in January 2013. The lecture notes are divided into
two parts.
  The first part, consisting of the bulk of these notes, provides an expository
account of the author's joint work with Christopher Douglas and Noah Snyder on
dualizability in low-dimensional higher categories and the connection to
low-dimensional topology. The cobordism hypothesis provides bridge between
topology and algebra, establishing important connections between these two
fields. One example of this is the prediction that the $n$-groupoid of
so-called `fully-dualizable' objects in any symmetric monoidal $n$-category
inherits an O(n)-action. However the proof of the cobordism hypothesis outlined
by Lurie is elaborate and inductive. Many consequences of the cobordism
hypothesis, such as the precise form of this O(n)-action, remain mysterious.
The aim of these lectures is to explain how this O(n)-action emerges in a range
of low category numbers ($n \leq 3$).
  The second part of these lecture notes focuses on the author's joint work
with Clark Barwick on the Unicity Theorem, as presented in arXiv:1112.0040.
This theorem and the accompanying machinery provide an axiomatization of the
theory of $(\infty,n)$-categories and several tools for verifying these axioms.

parallax and linear motions of the individual masers. The maser motions with
the parallax subtracted were well modeled by a combination of a common stellar
proper motion and a radial expansion motion of the circumstellar envelope. We
obtained an annual parallax of 0.356+/-0.026 mas and a stellar proper motion of
{\mu}*{\alpha}cos{\delta}=-3.7+/-0.2 and {\mu}*{\delta}=-2.0+/-0.3 mas/yr
eastward and northward, respectively. The annual parallax corresponds to a
trigonometric parallax of 2.81+0.22-0.19 kpc. By rescaling the luminosity of PZ
Cas in any previous studies using our trigonometric parallax, we estimated the
location of PZ Cas on a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and found that it
approaches a theoretically evolutionary track around an initial mass of
~25M(sun). The sky position and the distance to PZ Cas are consistent with the
OB association, Cas OB5, which is located in a molecular gas super shell. The
proper motion of PZ Cas is close to that of the OB stars and other red
supergiants in Cas OB5 measured by the Hipparcos satellite. We derived the
peculiar motion of PZ Cas of Us = 22.8+/-1.5, Vs = 7.1+/-4.4, and Ws =
-5.7+/-4.4 km/s. This peculiar motion has rather a large Us component, unlike
those of near high-mass star-forming regions with negatively large Vs motions.

of giant molecular clouds moving into local potential minima in a

replaced by a classical q-deformed Poisson-Hopf algebra. Another noteworthy
aspect of the deformation in the coset sigma-model case is that it interpolates
between a compact and a non-compact symmetric space. This is exemplified in the

obtained from the independent analysis of CoRoT r, g, and b colours and
ground-based follow-up photometric observations ruled out the possibility of
either a background monoperiodic or a Blazhko type RR Lyrae star being in the

reveal a $P_rot = 8.8$ hours $(f_0 = 2.735$ c d$^{-1})$ mean rotation period.
The evolution of the active regions helped to derive a period change of $dP/dt

decay of the old spotted region and an appearance of a new one, respectively. A
star that is detected only in the CoRoT b domain shows a $f_1 = 7.172$ c

triplet structure. The best explanation for our observation is a $\beta$ Cep

  Sampling","31 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables",,,,"stat.ME cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Respondent driven sampling (RDS) is a method often used to estimate
population properties (e.g. sexual risk behavior) in hard-to-reach populations.
It combines an effective modified snowball sampling methodology with an
estimation procedure that yields unbiased population estimates under the
assumption that the sampling process behaves like a random walk on the social
network of the population. Current RDS estimation methodology assumes that the
social network is undirected, i.e. that all edges are reciprocal. However,
empirical social networks in general also have non-reciprocated edges. To
account for this fact, we develop a new estimation method for RDS in the
presence of directed edges on the basis of random walks on directed networks.
We distinguish directed and undirected edges and consider the possibility that
the random walk returns to its current position in two steps through an
undirected edge. We derive estimators of the selection probabilities of
individuals as a function of the number of outgoing edges of sampled
individuals. We evaluate the performance of the proposed estimators on
artificial and empirical networks to show that they generally perform better
than existing methods. This is in particular the case when the fraction of
directed edges in the network is large.

transport in an axisymmetric tube by cilia. However, an attempt has been made
to explain the role of cilia motion on the transport of fluid through the
ductus efferentes of the male reproductive tract. Ostwald-de Waele power-law
viscous fluid has been considered to represent the rheological fluid. To
analyze pumping by means of a sequence of beat of cilia from row-to-row of
cilia in a given row of cells and from one row of cells to the next
(metachronal wave movement), we consider the conditions that the corresponding
Reynolds number is small enough for inertial effects to be negligible and the
wavelength to diameter ratio is large enough for the pressure to be considered
uniform over the cross-section. Analyses and computations of the detailed fluid
motion reveal that the time-averaged flow rate is dependent on $\epsilon$, a
non-dimensional measure involving the mean radius $a$ of the tube and the cilia
length. Thus, flow rate significantly varies with the cilia length. Moreover,
the flow rate has been reported near to the estimated value $6\times
10^{-3}$$ml/h$ for human efferent ducts if $\epsilon$ is near by 0.4. The
estimated value was suggested by Lardner and Shack [1] in human, based on the
experimental observations for flow rates in efferent ducts of other animals,
e.g., rat, ram and bull. In addition, the nature of the rheological fluid,
i.e., the value of the fluid index $n$ strongly influences various
flow-governed characteristics. The interesting feature of the paper is that the
pumping improves with the thickening behavior for small values of $\epsilon$ or
in free pumping ($\Delta P=0$) and pumping ($\Delta P>0$) regions.

portfolios may consist of thousands of reinsurance contracts covering millions
of insured locations. To quantify risk each portfolio must be evaluated in up
to a million simulation trials, each capturing a different possible sequence of
catastrophic events over the course of a contractual year. In this paper, we
explore the design of a flexible framework for portfolio risk analysis that
facilitates answering a rich variety of catastrophic risk queries. Rather than
aggregating simulation data in order to produce a small set of high-level risk
metrics efficiently (as is often done in production risk management systems),
the focus here is on allowing the user to pose queries on unaggregated or
partially aggregated data. The goal is to provide a flexible framework that can
be used by analysts to answer a wide variety of unanticipated but natural ad
hoc queries. Such detailed queries can help actuaries or underwriters to better
understand the multiple dimensions (e.g., spatial correlation, seasonality,
peril features, construction features, and financial terms) that can impact
portfolio risk. We implemented a prototype system, called QuPARA (Query-Driven
Large-Scale Portfolio Aggregate Risk Analysis), using Hadoop, which is Apache's
implementation of the MapReduce paradigm. This allows the user to take
advantage of large parallel compute servers in order to answer ad hoc risk
analysis queries efficiently even on very large data sets typically encountered
in practice. We describe the design and implementation of QuPARA and present
experimental results that demonstrate its feasibility. A full portfolio risk
analysis run consisting of a 1,000,000 trial simulation, with 1,000 events per
trial, and 3,200 risk transfer contracts can be completed on a 16-node Hadoop

presented in the power spectrum as 13 harmonics of the fundamental frequency
fa=1/Pa=1/23172 day-1. We refer to them as the ""red"" frequencies. Oscillations
with the binary periodicity of the system Pb=1/fb=681.48 d are also seen in the

in the power spectrum is accompanied by 13 other peaks on each side, to which
we refer as the ""blue"" frequencies. A distinct structure in the frequency
distribution of the blue peaks, as well as in their peak power are best
interpreted as reflecting beating of the 13 ""red"" frequencies with the binary

result from events of intense mass loss from the giant star. Mass accretion
onto the hot component, partially through the L1 point of the system, took
place in the last 125 years at a rate that oscillated with the 13 first

periastron passages induced modulation of the L1 accretion at the binary

provides an alternative method to extract the transverse momentum spectra of
charged kaons. This combination allows to track and identify charged hadrons in
the transverse momentum ($p_{t}$) range from 100 MeV/c up to 2.5 GeV/$c$.
Mesons containing strange quarks (\kos, $\phi$) and both singly and doubly

elliptical (dE) satellites NGC 147 and NGC 185. Three of these are associated
with NGC 147 and one with NGC 185. All lie beyond the main optical boundaries
of the galaxies and are the most remote clusters yet known in these systems.
Radial velocities derived from low resolution spectra are used to argue that
the GCs are bound to the dwarfs and are not part of the M31 halo population.
Combining PAndAS with UKIRT/WFCAM data, we present the first homogeneous
optical and near-IR photometry for the entire GC systems of these dEs.
Colour-colour plots and published colour-metallicity relations are employed to
constrain GC ages and metallicities. It is demonstrated that the clusters are
in general metal poor ([Fe/H] < -1.25 dex), while the ages are more difficult
to constrain. The mean (V-I)$_0$ colours of the two GC systems are very similar
to those of the GC systems of dEs in the Virgo and Fornax clusters, as well as
the extended halo GC population in M31. The new clusters bring the GC specific
frequency (S_N) to ~9 in NGC 147 and ~5 in NGC 185, consistent with values
found for dEs of similar luminosity residing in a range of environments.

formation. During this phase, the growth of planetary precursors occurs by
agglomeration of micrometer-sized dust grains into aggregates of at least
millimeters to centimeters in size. However, the formation of larger bodies
from the so-formed building blocks is not yet fully understood. Recent
numerical models on dust growth lack a particular support by experimental
studies in the size range of submillimeters, because these particles are
predicted to collide at very gentle relative velocities of below 1 cm/s that
can only be achieved in a reduced-gravity environment.

silicate-dust aggregates inside several evacuated glass containers which are
being agitated by a shaker to induce the desired collisions at chosen

allowing for the determination of the collision properties of the

illuminates the crust in a manner different from tectonic sources, and
therefore provides independent information. The primary measurable is the
two-point cross-correlation, evaluated using traces recorded at a pair of
seismometers over a finite-time interval. However, raw seismic traces contain
intermittent large-amplitude perturbations arising from tectonic activity and
instrumental errors, which may corrupt the estimated cross-correlations of
microseismic fluctuations. In order to diminish the impact of these
perturbations, the recorded traces are filtered using the nonlinear one-bit
digitizer, which replaces the measurement by its sign. Previous theory shows
that for stationary Gaussian-distributed seismic noise fluctuations one-bit and
raw correlation functions are related by a simple invertible transformation.
Here we extend this to show that the simple correspondence between these two
correlation techniques remains valid for {\it non-stationary} Gaussian and a
very broad range of {\it non-Gaussian} processes as well. For a limited range
of stationary and non-stationary Gaussian fluctuations, we find that one-bit
filtering performs at least as well as spectral whitening. We therefore
recommend using one-bit filtering when processing terrestrial seismic noise,
with the substantial benefit that the measurements are fully compatible with
current theoretical interpretation (e.g., adjoint theory). Given that seismic
records are non-stationary and comprise small-amplitude fluctuations and
intermittent, large-amplitude tectonic/other perturbations, we outline an
algorithm to accurately retrieve the correlation function of the
small-amplitude signals.

case for parallel computing, which is in a total state of flux, and where
experiments are necessary to substantiate, complement, and challenge
theoretical modeling and analysis. Here, experimental work is as important as
are advances in theory, that are indeed often driven by the experimental
findings. In parallel computing, scientific contributions presented in research
articles are therefore often based on experimental data, with a substantial
part devoted to presenting and discussing the experimental findings. As in all
of experimental science, experiments must be presented in a way that makes
reproduction by other researchers possible, in principle. Despite appearance to
the contrary, we contend that reproducibility plays a small role, and is
typically not achieved. As can be found, articles often do not have a
sufficiently detailed description of their experiments, and do not make
available the software used to obtain the claimed results. As a consequence,
parallel computational results are most often impossible to reproduce, often
questionable, and therefore of little or no scientific value. We believe that
the description of how to reproduce findings should play an important part in
every serious, experiment-based parallel computing research article. We aim to
initiate a discussion of the reproducibility issue in parallel computing, and
elaborate on the importance of reproducible research for (1) better and sounder
technical/scientific papers, (2) a sounder and more efficient review process
and (3) more effective collective work. This paper expresses our current view
on the subject and should be read as a position statement for discussion and

phase of the flare was due to free-free emission. Reliable measurements could
not be made for the 171A channel, while the continuum contribution to the 304A
channel was negligible due to the presence of the strong He II emission line.
Up to 50% of the emission in the 211A channel was found to be due to free-free
emission around the peak of the flare, while an additional 20% was due to the
recombination continuum of He II. The analysis was extended to a number of M-
and X-class flares and it was found that the level of free-free emission
contributing to the 171A and 211A passbands increased with increasing GOES
class. These results suggest that the amount of continuum emission that
contributes to AIA observations during flares is more significant than that
stated in previous studies which used synthetic, rather than observed, spectra.
These findings highlight the importance of spectroscopic observations carried
out in conjunction with those from imaging instruments so that the data are

fermion fields transforming as singlets, doublets or triplets under SU(2), and
neutrino masses are generated radiatively via 1-loop diagrams. The dark matter
candidates are stabilized by a Z_2 symmetry and are in general mixtures of the
neutral components of such new multiplets. We describe the particle content of
each of these models and determine the conditions under which they are
consistent with current data. We find a total of 35 viable models, most of
which have not been previously studied in the literature. There is a great
potential to test these models at the LHC not only due to the TeV-scale masses
of the new fields but also because about half of the viable models contain
particles with exotic electric charges, which give rise to background-free
signals. Our results should serve as a first step for detailed analysis of
models that can simultaneously account for dark matter and neutrino masses.

between two glass plates. Our experimental observations show that the mean
displacements are biased towards the center of hydrodynamic stress (CoH), and
that the mean-square displacements exhibit a crossover from short time faster
to long time slower diffusion with the short-time diffusion coefficients
dependent on the points used for tracking. A model based on Langevin theory
elucidates that these behaviors are ascribed to a superposition of two
diffusive modes: the ellipsoidal motion of the CoH and the rotational motion of
the tracking point with respect to the CoH.

harnessed to characterize urban spaces and organize them into neighborhoods. In
this work, we adopt a data-driven approach to the identification and modeling
of urban neighborhoods using location-based social networks. We represent
geographic points in the city using spatio-temporal information about
Foursquare user check-ins and semantic information about places, with the goal
of developing features to input into a novel neighborhood detection algorithm.
The algorithm first employs a similarity metric that assesses the homogeneity
of a geographic area, and then with a simple mechanism of geographic
navigation, it detects the boundaries of a city's neighborhoods. The models and
algorithms devised are subsequently integrated into a publicly available,
map-based tool named Hoodsquare that allows users to explore activities and
neighborhoods in cities around the world.
  Finally, we evaluate Hoodsquare in the context of a recommendation
application where user profiles are matched to urban neighborhoods. By
comparing with a number of baselines, we demonstrate how Hoodsquare can be used
to accurately predict the home neighborhood of Twitter users. We also show that
we are able to suggest neighborhoods geographically constrained in size, a
desirable property in mobile recommendation scenarios for which geographical
precision is key.

upon argon scintillation light. We monitor the light yield from an alpha source
held 20 cm from a cryogenic photomultiplier tube (PMT) assembly as methane is
injected into a high-purity liquid argon volume. We observe significant
suppression of the scintillation light yield by dissolved methane at the 10
part per billion (ppb) level. By examining the late scintillation light time
constant, we determine that this loss is caused by an absorption process and
also see some evidence of methane-induced scintillation quenching at higher
concentrations (50-100 ppb). Using a second PMT assembly we look for visible
re-emission features from the dissolved methane which have been reported in
gas-phase argon methane mixtures, and we find no evidence of visible
re-emission from liquid-phase argon methane mixtures at concentrations between
10 ppb and 0.1%.

gyroscopic stability is lowered from 1.3 to 1.0. It is well known that a bullet
can tumble for stability less than 1.0. The Sierra Loading Manuals (4th and 5th
Editions) have previously reported that ballistic coefficient decreases
significantly as gyroscopic stability, Sg, is lowered below 1.3. These
observations are further confirmed by experiments reported here. Measured
ballistic coefficients were compared with gyroscopic stabilities computed using
the Miller Twist Rule for nearly solid metal bullets with uniform density and
computed using the Courtney-Miller formula for plastic-tipped bullets. The
relationship between Sg and drag may be used to test the applicability of
existing gyroscopic stability formulas for given bullet designs and to evaluate
the accuracy of alternate formulas in cases where the existing stability
formulas are not as accurate. The most definitive test of formulas predicting
stability will always be observation of whether bullets tumble under given
conditions. However, observations of drag changes provide valuable supplemental
information because they suggest changes in stability as conditions change. Use
of a continuous variable (drag) rather than a binary variable (tumbling) allows
insight into stability over a range of conditions where the binary variable
does not change.

However, in the non-Abelian case this procedure leads to the well known Gribov
ambiguity. In order to solve the ambiguity a modification of the functional
integral formula must be introduced. As a consequence of this, the Green
functions get deep modifications in the infrared. We consider in particular the
SU (N) case and show that in the pure gauge case the ghost propagator is
enhanced, while the gluon propagator is suppressed in this limit, therefore the
study of the Gribov ambiguity may shed some light on the mass gap problem and
on colour confinement. We discuss some recent developments on the subject in
the case of a curved background. We argue that the concurrent presence of a
spacetime curvature and the Gribov ambiguity may introduce further
modifications to the Green functions in the infrared.

which we demonstrate several possible observables that may be detected at the

also explain recent Planck data which, when added to HST data gives an excess
of relativistic degrees of freedom of \Delta N = 0.574 +- 0.25 above the
standard result. Also explored is a possible non-thermal dark matter model for
explanation of this result. Recent observations of Fermi bubble results
indicate a signal of a 50 GeV dark matter particle annihilating into b b-bar,
with a thermally averaged annihilation cross section corresponding to < \sigma
v> = 8 X 10^(-27) cm^3/s, spurs interest in a Higgs portal model suggested by
Steven Weinberg. Other implications of this model are also explored such as its
ability to explain dark matter direct detection results along with LHC Higgs
data, and Planck data. Particle physics is complimented by possible stochastic
gravitational wave searches for which a model of second order global phase
transitions is explored. These transitions generate gravitational wave spectra
with amplitudes of order \Omega_{gw} h^2 = 10^(-24) - 10^(-15). Furthermore,
techniques into such calculations are investigated in hopes to improve the

Legacy Survey (CANDELS) photometric redshift methods investigation. In this
investigation, the results from eleven participants, each using a different
combination of photometric redshift code, template spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) and priors, are used to examine the properties of
photometric redshifts applied to deep fields with broad-band multi-wavelength
coverage. The photometry used includes U-band through mid-infrared filters and
was derived using the TFIT method. Comparing the results, we find that there is
no particular code or set of template SEDs that results in significantly better
photometric redshifts compared to others. However, we find codes producing the
lowest scatter and outlier fraction utilize a training sample to optimize
photometric redshifts by adding zero-point offsets, template adjusting or
adding extra smoothing errors. These results therefore stress the importance of
the training procedure. We find a strong dependence of the photometric redshift
accuracy on the signal-to-noise ratio of the photometry. On the other hand, we
find a weak dependence of the photometric redshift scatter with redshift and
galaxy color. We find that most photometric redshift codes quote redshift
errors (e.g., 68% confidence intervals) that are too small compared to that
expected from the spectroscopic control sample. We find that all codes show a
statistically significant bias in the photometric redshifts. However, the bias
is in all cases smaller than the scatter, the latter therefore dominates the
errors. Finally, we find that combining results from multiple codes
significantly decreases the photometric redshift scatter and outlier fraction.
We discuss different ways of combining data to produce accurate photometric
redshifts and error estimates.

estimate the unknown gains along with the unknown sparse signals. For the
second case, we formulate a quadratic approach that eliminates the unknown

this approach is also formulated to reduce complexity and memory requirements
and provide scalability with respect to the number of input signals. Finally

social interactions of animals that compete for resources. We then consider a
game-playing strategy in which animals acquire information about their RHP
asymmetry from the results of their previous contests and subsequently use
their asymmetry assessment to inform their behavior in future contests. We
examine how directly incorporating the fact that animals have incomplete
information in their interactions can lead to outcomes that differ from what
would be expected if one considers the situation as a static game in which the
animals have perfect information about the asymmetry size. We thereby obtain
results that are consistent with observations of dominance-hierarchy formation
in social animals. We also discuss how increased interactions between animals
can speed up the asymmetry assessment process and how this can explain why
aggression can sometimes decrease as the number of interactions between animals

States and globally. While influenza vaccines are the single most effective
intervention to reduce influenza morbidity and mortality, there is considerable
debate surrounding the merits and consequences of repeated seasonal
vaccination. Here, we describe a two-season influenza epidemic contact network
model and use it to demonstrate that increasing the level of continuity in
vaccination across seasons reduces the burden on public health. We show that
revaccination reduces the influenza attack rate not only because it reduces the
overall number of susceptible individuals, but also because it better protects
highly-connected individuals, who would otherwise make a disproportionately
large contribution to influenza transmission. Our work thus contributes a
population-level perspective to debates about the merits of repeated influenza
vaccination and advocates for public health policy to incorporate individual

number of works have been devoted to analyzing the convergence of the
underlying algorithms. Nevertheless, in most cases, rather simplified
hypotheses are used. For example, it often assumes that the swarm has only one
particle. In addition, more often than not, the variables and the points of
attraction are assumed to remain constant throughout the optimization process.
In reality, such assumptions are often violated. Moreover, there are no
rigorous rates of convergence results available to date for the particle swarm,
to the best of our knowledge. In this paper, we consider a general form of PSO
algorithms, and analyze asymptotic properties of the algorithms using
stochastic approximation methods. We introduce four coefficients and rewrite
the PSO procedure as a stochastic approximation type iterative algorithm. Then
we analyze its convergence using weak convergence method. It is proved that a
suitably scaled sequence of swarms converge to the solution of an ordinary
differential equation. We also establish certain stability results. Moreover,
convergence rates are ascertained by using weak convergence method. A centered

formal logical system that explicitly portrays reasoning as a temporal
activity, with each extralogical input to the system and each inference rule
application being viewed as occurring at a distinct time step. Every DRS
incorporates some well-defined logic together with a controller that serves to
guide the reasoning process in response to user inputs. Logics are generic,
whereas controllers are application-specific. Every controller does,
nonetheless, provide an algorithm for nonmonotonic belief revision. The general
notion of a DRS comprises a framework within which one can formulate the logic
and algorithms for a given application and prove that the algorithms are
correct, i.e., that they serve to (i) derive all salient information and (ii)
preserve the consistency of the belief set. This paper illustrates the idea
with ordinary first-order predicate calculus, suitably modified for the present
purpose, and two examples. The latter example revisits some classic
nonmonotonic reasoning puzzles (Opus the Penguin, Nixon Diamond) and shows how
these can be resolved in the context of a DRS, using an expanded version of
first-order logic that incorporates typed predicate symbols. All concepts are
rigorously defined and effectively computable, thereby providing the foundation
for a future software implementation.

which future observations of a hypothetical class of stars orbiting very close
to the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy, known as Sgr A*,
could provide tests of the so-called no-hair theorem of general relativity
through the measurement of precessions of their orbital planes. By considering
how a distribution of stars and stellar mass black holes in the central cluster
would perturb the orbits of those hypothetical stars, we show that for stars
within about 0.2 milliparsecs (about 6 light-hours) of the black hole, the
relativistic precessions dominate, leaving a potential window for tests of
no-hair theorems. Our results are in agreement with N-body simulation results.
  In the second part, we develop a fully general relativistic phase-space
formulation to consider the effects of the Galactic center supermassive black
hole Sgr A* on the dark-matter density profile and its applications in the
indirect detection of dark matter. We find significant differences from the
non-relativistic result of Gondolo and Silk (1999), including a higher density
for the spike and a larger degree of central concentration. Having the dark
matter profile density in the presence of the massive black hole, we calculate
its perturbing effect on the orbital motions of stars in the Galactic center,
and find that for the stars of interest, relativistic effects related to the
hair on the black hole will dominate the effects of dark matter.

However, even successful modeling approaches such as pedestrian models based on

underlying collective pedestrian behavior. This paper extends a behavioral
heuristics-based pedestrian model to an adaptive agent-based model, which
explicitly considers the crowding effect of neighboring individuals and
perception anisotropy on the representation of a pedestrians visual
information. The adaptive agents with crowding perception are constructed to
investigate complex, selforganized collective dynamics of pedestrian motion.
The proposed model simulates selforganized pedestrian flows in good
quantitative agreement with empirical data. The selforganized phenomena include
lane formation in bidirectional flow and fundamental diagrams of unidirectional
flow. Simulation results show that the emergence of lane formation in
bidirectional flow can be well reproduced. To investigate this further,
increasing view distance has a significant effect on reducing the number of
lanes, increasing lane width, and stabilizing the self-organized lanes. The
paper also discusses phase transitions of fundamental diagrams of pedestrian
crowds with unidirectional flow. It is found that the heterogeneity of how
pedestrians perceive crowding in the population has a remarkable impact on the
flow quality, which results in the buildup of congestion and rapidly decreases
the efficiency of pedestrian flows. It also indicates that the concept of
heterogeneity may be used to explain the instability of phase transitions.

set of five assumptions. The assumptions state that: (a) the state vector fully
determines the probabilities of all measurement results; (b) between
measurements, any quantum system is governed by that part of standard quantum
mechanics, which does not refer to measurements; (c) probabilities of
measurement results obey the rules of the classical theory of probability; (d)
no information transfer is possible without interaction; (e) if two spin-1/2
particles are in the entangled state (sqrt(1-\lambda)|up>|up> +
sqrt(\lambda)|down>|down>), and one of spins is measured by the Stern-Gerlach
apparatus, then the state of the other spin after this measurement will be
either |up> or |down>, corresponding to the measurement result. No one of these
assumptions can be omitted. The method of the derivation is based on Zurek's
idea of environment-assisted invariance [PRL 90, 120404 (2003)], though taken
in rather modified form. Entanglement plays a crucial role in our approach
(like in Zurek's one), so the probabilities are first considered in the case
when the measured quantum system is entangled with some environment.
Probabilities in pure states appear then as a particular case. The method of
the present paper can be applied to both ideal and non-ideal measuring devices,
irrespective to their constructions and principles of operation.

$WH_L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ associated to $L$ for $p\in (0,\,1]$ via the
non-tangential square function $S_L$ and establish a weak molecular
characterization of $WH_L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$. Typical examples of such operators
include the $2k$-order divergence form homogeneous elliptic operator
$L_1:=(-1)^k\sum_{|\alpha|=k=|\beta|}\partial^\beta(a_{\alpha,\beta}\partial^\alpha)$,
where $\{a_{\alpha,\beta}\}_{|\alpha|=k=|\beta|}$ are complex bounded
measurable functions, and the $2k$-order Schr\""odinger type operator $L_2:=
(-\Delta)^k+V^k$, where $\Delta$ is the Laplacian operator and $0\le V\in
L^k_{\mathop\mathrm{loc}}(\mathbb{R}^n)$. As applications, for $i\in\{1,\,2\}$
and $p\in(\frac{n}{n+k},\,1]$, the authors prove that the associated Riesz
transform $\nabla^k (L_i^{-1/2})$ is bounded from $WH^p_{L_i}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ to
the classical weak Hardy space $WH^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and, for all $0<p<r\le1$
and $\alpha=n(\frac{1}{p}-\frac{1}{r})$, the fractional power
$L_i^{-\frac{\alpha}{2k}}$ is bounded from $WH_{L_i}^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ to
$WH_{L_i}^r(\mathbb{R}^n)$. Furthermore, the authors find the dual space of
$WH_L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for $p\in(0,\,1]$, which can be defined via mean
oscillations based on some subtle coverings of bounded open sets and, even when
$L:=-\Delta$, are also previously unknown. In particular, if $L$ is a
nonnegative self-adjoint operator in $L^2({\mathbb R}^n)$ satisfying the
Davies-Gaffney estimates, the authors further establish the weak atomic
characterization of $WH_L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$.

of amygdala activity via real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) with positive
emotion induction was associated, in healthy participants, with an enhancement
in the functional connectivity between the left amygdala (LA) and six regions
of the prefrontal cortex. These regions included the left rostral anterior
cingulate cortex (rACC), bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC),
bilateral superior frontal gyrus (SFG), and right medial frontopolar cortex

functional neuroanatomical network engaged during the rtfMRI-nf procedure. Here
we perform a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) analysis of the effective
connectivity for this network. The SVAR analysis demonstrates that the left
rACC plays an important role during the rtfMRI-nf training, modulating the LA
and the other network regions. According to the analysis, the rtfMRI-nf
training leads to a significant enhancement in the time-lagged effect of the
left rACC on the LA. The training is also accompanied by significant increases
in the instantaneous (contemporaneous) effects of the left rACC on four other

instantaneous effects of the LA on the bilateral DMPFC are also significantly
enhanced. Our results are consistent with a broad literature supporting the

of debris disks, which are the remnants of old planetary systems. The infrared
excess detected with \emph{Spitzer} and the lines of heavy elements observed in
their atmospheres with high-resolution spectroscopy converge on the idea that
planetary material accretes onto these stars. Accretion rates have been derived
by several authors with the assumption of a steady state between accretion and
gravitational settling. The results are unrealistically different for DA and DB
white dwarfs. When heavy matter is accreted onto stars, it induces an inverse
$\mu$-gradient that leads to fingering (thermohaline) convection. The aim of
this letter is to study the impact of this specific process on the derived
accretion rates in white dwarfs and on the difference between DA and DB. We
solve the diffusion equation for the accreted heavy elements with a
time-dependent method. The models we use have been obtained both with the IRAP
code, which computes static models, and the La Plata code, which computes
evolutionary sequences. Computations with pure gravitational settling are
compared with computations that include fingering convection. The most
important result is that fingering convection has very important effects on DAs
but is inefficient in DBs. When only gravitational settling is taken into
account, the time-dependent computations lead to a steady state, as postulated
by previous authors. When fingering convection is added, this steady state
occurs much later. The surprising difference found in the past for the
accretion rates derived for DA and DB white dwarfs disappears. The derived
accretion rates for DAs are increased when fingering convection is taken into
account, whereas those for DBs are not modified. More precise and developed
results will be given in a forthcoming paper.

demonstrate that the effects of a running $G$ are obvious both in the

evolutionary sequences depend on both the value of $\dot G/G$, and on the value
of $G$ when the white dwarf was born. We show as well that the pulsational
properties of variable white dwarfs can be used to constrain $\dot G/G$.
Finally, we also show that the ensemble properties of of white dwarfs in
clusters can also be used to set upper bounds to $\dot G/G$. Precisely, the
tightest bound --- $\dot G/G \sim -1.8 10^{-12}$ yr$^{-1}$ --- is obtained
studying the population of the old, metal-rich, well populated, open cluster
NGC 6791. Less stringent upper limits can be obtained comparing the theoretical
results obtained taking into account the effects of a running $G$ with the
measured rates of change of the periods of two well studied pulsating white
dwarfs, G117--B15A and R548. Using these white dwarfs we obtain $\dot G/G\sim
-1.8\times 10^{-10}$ yr$^{-1}$, and $\dot G/G\sim -1.3\times 10^{-10}$

scaling the effects of different particles. A different way of predicting the
radiation damage is based on the Norget-Robinson-Torrens theorem to predict the

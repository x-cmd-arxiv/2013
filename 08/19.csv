universality. Colloidal particles, immersed in a solvent close to criticality,
experience long-range effective forces, named critical Casimir forces. %These
originate from the confinement of the solvent critical fluctuations between the
colloids. Building on the analogy between critical phenomena and percolation,
we explore the possibility of observing long-range forces near a percolation
threshold. To this aim we numerically evaluate the effective potential between
two colloidal particles dispersed in a chemical sol and we show that it becomes
attractive and long-ranged on approaching the sol percolation transition. We
develop a theoretical description based on a polydisperse Asakura-Oosawa model
which captures the divergence of the interaction range, allowing us to
interpret such effect in terms of depletion interactions in a structured
solvent. Our results provide the geometric analogue of the critical Casimir
force, suggesting a novel way for tuning colloidal interactions by controlling
the clustering properties of the solvent.

tessellating planar regions. We propose a new variational principle for
improving 2D triangle meshes where the energy functional is a convex function
over the angle structures whose maximizer is unique and consists only of
equilateral triangles. This energy functional is related to hyperbolic volume
of ideal 3-simplex. Even with extra constraints on the angles for embedding the
mesh into the plane and preserving the boundary, the energy functional remains
well-behaved. We devise an efficient algorithm for maximizing the energy
functional over these extra constraints. We apply our algorithm to various
datasets and compare its performance with that of CVT. The experimental results
show that our algorithm produces the meshes with both the angles and the aspect
ratios of triangles lying in tighter intervals.

projector system to image a target mask composed of a grid of pinholes,
emulating stellar point sources, onto a 1.7 micron cut-off Teledyne HgCdTe/H2RG

produce undersampled point spread functions similar to those expected from
WFIRST. We also emulated the WFIRST image reconstruction strategy, using the
IMage COMbination (IMCOM) algorithm to derive oversampled images from dithered,
undersampled input images. We created shear maps for this data and computed
shear correlation functions to mimic a real weak lensing analysis. After
removing only 2nd order polynomial fits to the shear maps, we found that the
correlation functions could be reduced to O(10^-6). This places a conservative
upper limit on the detector-induced bias to the correlation function (under our
test conditions). This bias is two orders of magnitude lower than the expected
weak lensing signal. Restricted to scales relevant to dark energy analyses (sky
separations > 0.5 arcmin), the bias is O(10^-7): comparable to the requirement
for future weak lensing missions to avoid biasing cosmological parameter
estimates. Our experiment will need to be upgraded and repeated under different

of glassy dynamics, such as caging behavior and dynamical heterogeneities,
although it has remained unclear how single-cell properties control this
behavior. Here we develop numerical and theoretical models to calculate energy
barriers to cell rearrangements, which help govern cell migration in cell
monolayers. In contrast to work on sheared foams, we find that energy barrier
heights are exponentially distributed and depend systematically on the cell's
number of neighbors. Based on these results, we predict glassy two-time
correlation functions for cell motion, with a timescale that increases rapidly
as cell activity decreases. These correlation functions are used to construct
simple random walks that reproduce the caging behavior observed for cell
trajectories in experiments. This work provides a theoretical framework for
predicting collective motion of cells in wound-healing, embryogenesis and
cancer tumorigenesis.

the wealth accumulation. Investigating the microscopic statistics of money

chromospheric diagnostics like the strong Ca II lines and H-alpha. New
high-resolution sunspot observations from the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope show
the ubiquitous presence of small-scale periodic jet-like features that move up
and down. This phenomenon has not been described before. Their typical width is
about 0.3 arcsec and they display clear parabolic trajectories in space-time
diagrams. The maximum extension of the top of the jets is lowest in the umbra,
a few 100 km, and progressively longer further away from the umbra in the
penumbra, with the longest more than 1000 km. These jets resemble dynamic
fibrils found in plage regions but at smaller extensions. LTE inversion of
spectro-polarimetric Ca II 8542 observations enabled for a comparison of the
magnetic field inclination and the properties of these short jets. We find that
the most extended of these jets also have longer periods and tend to be located
in regions with more horizontal magnetic fields. This is a direct observational
confirmation of the mechanism of long-period waves propagating along inclined
magnetic fields into the solar chromosphere. This mechanism was identified
earlier as the driver of dynamic fibrils in plage, part of the mottles in quiet
Sun, and type I spicules at the limb. The sunspot dynamic fibrils that we
report here represent a new class of manifestation of this mechanism. They are
not the same as the transient penumbral and umbral micro-jets reported earlier.

is the detection of narrow blueshifted time-varying Na I D absorption lines,
interpreted as evidence of circumstellar material (CSM) surrounding the
progenitor system. The origin of this material is controversial, but the
simplest explanation is that it results from previous mass loss in a system
containing a white dwarf and a non-degenerate companion star. We present new
single-epoch intermediate-resolution spectra of 17 low-redshift SNe Ia taken
with XShooter on the ESO Very Large Telescope. Combining this sample with
events from the literature, we confirm an excess (~20 per cent) of SNe Ia
displaying blueshifted narrow Na I D absorption features compared to
non-blueshifted Na I D features. The host galaxies of SNe Ia displaying
blueshifted absorption profiles are skewed towards later-type galaxies,
compared to SNe Ia that show no Na I D absorption, and SNe Ia displaying
blueshifted narrow Na I D absorption features have broader light curves. The
strength of the Na I D absorption is stronger in SNe Ia displaying blueshifted
Na I D absorption features than those without blueshifted features, and the
strength of the blueshifted Na I D is correlated with the B-V colour of the SN
at maximum light. This strongly suggests the absorbing material is local to the
SN. In the context of the progenitor systems of SNe Ia, we discuss the
significance of these findings and other recent observational evidence on the
nature of SN Ia progenitors. We present a summary that suggests there are at
least two distinct populations of normal, cosmologically useful SNe Ia.

largely absent among bright dwarf sungrazers, whose temporal sequence implies
the presence of a swarm, with the objects brighter at maximum than apparent
magnitude 3 arriving at a peak rate of about 4.6 per year in late 2010, while
those brighter than magnitude 2 at a peak rate of about 4.3 per year in early
2011, both a few times the pre-swarm rate. The entire population of SOHO/STEREO
Kreutz sungrazers also peaked about one year before the appearance of C/2011

similar to that of comet C/1843 D1, deviating 10 deg or more from the orbit of
C/2011 W3 in the angular elements. The evidence from the swarm and the overall
elevated arrival rates suggests the existence of a fragmented sizable sungrazer
that shortly preceded C/2011 W3 but was independent of it. On the other hand,
these findings represent another warning signal that the expected 21st-century

learning that ties closely to modern developments in neuroscience, psychology,

discuss epistemological framing -- the role of students' perceptions of the

bring to bear on a given task. I discuss how this foothold idea fits into our

class of continuous shrinkage priors on the precision matrix elements, which
induces shrinkage under an equivalence with Cholesky-based regularization while
enabling conjugate updates of entire precision matrices. Subsequently, we
propose a post-fitting graphical model estimation step which proceeds using
penalized joint credible regions to perform neighborhood selection sequentially
for each node. The posterior computation proceeds using straightforward fully
Gibbs sampling, and the approach is scalable to high dimensions. The proposed
approach is shown to be asymptotically consistent in estimating the graph

understanding of galaxy formation and evolution rests sensitively on
relationships between different astrophysical variables; hence an ability to
detect and verify associations or correlations between variables is important
in astrophysical research. In this paper, we apply a recently defined
statistical measure called the distance correlation coefficient which can be
used to identify new associations and correlations between astrophysical
variables. The distance correlation coefficient applies to variables of any
dimension; it can be used to determine smaller sets of variables that provide
equivalent astrophysical information; it is zero only when variables are
independent; and it is capable of detecting nonlinear associations that are
undetectable by the classical Pearson correlation coefficient. Hence, the
distance correlation coefficient provides more information than the Pearson
coefficient. We analyze numerous pairs of variables in the COMBO-17 database
with the distance correlation method and with the maximal information
coefficient. We show that the Pearson coefficient can be estimated with higher
accuracy from the corresponding distance correlation coefficient than from the
maximal information coefficient. For given values of the Pearson coefficient,
the distance correlation method has a greater ability than the maximal
information coefficient to resolve astrophysical data into highly concentrated
V-shapes, which enhances classification and pattern identification. These
results are observed over a range of redshifts beyond the local universe and
for galaxies from elliptical to spiral.

extinction in Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is still a puzzle. A proposed explanation
of the excess is the photoelectric absorption due to the intervening clouds
along a GRB's line-of-sight. We here test this scenario by using the
intervening \ion{Mg}{2} absorption as a tracer of the neutral hydrogen column
density of the intervening clouds. We identify a connection between large X-ray
column density (and large column density ratio of
$\mathrm{\log(N_{H,X}/N_{HI})}\sim0.5$) and large neutral hydrogen column
density probed by the \ion{Mg}{2} doublet ratio (DR). In addition, GRBs with
large X-ray column density (and large ratio of

prohibited the high-mass star formation in the two cores which originally have
larger total masses. In both regions the abundance ratio of ${\rm

encoding them to CNF and applying an underlying SAT solver. In BEE constraints
are modeled as Boolean functions which propagate information about equalities

factor is that considering only a small fragment of a constraint model at one
time enables to apply stronger, and even complete reasoning to detect
equivalent literals in that fragment. Once detected, equivalences propagate to
simplify the entire constraint model and facilitate further reasoning on other
fragments. BEE is described in several recent papers. In this paper, after a

analysis is challenging both theoretically and methodologically. We offer a new
automatic procedure for finding a sparse semivarying coefficient model, which
is widely accepted for longitudinal data analysis. Our proposed method first
reduces the number of covariates to a moderate order by employing a screening
procedure, and then identifies both the varying and constant coefficients using
a group SCAD estimator, which is subsequently refined by accounting for the
within-subject correlation. The screening procedure is based on working
independence and B-spline marginal models. Under weaker conditions than those
in the literature, we show that with high probability only irrelevant variables
will be screened out, and the number of selected variables can be bounded by a
moderate order. This allows the desirable sparsity and oracle properties of the
subsequent structure identification step. Note that existing methods require
some kind of iterative screening in order to achieve this, thus they demand
heavy computational effort and consistency is not guaranteed. The refined
semivarying coefficient model employs profile least squares, local linear
smoothing and nonparametric covariance estimation, and is semiparametric
efficient. We also suggest ways to implement the proposed methods, and to
select the tuning parameters. An extensive simulation study is summarized to
demonstrate its finite sample performance and the yeast cell cycle data is
analyzed.

collisions with the GNMR, which strongly influences the resulting mechanical
oscillation, and thus the quality factors. We also predict a discontinuous
transition in the quality factor at a lower critical temperature, which results
from the in-plane migration of the adsorbate. Overall, our work clearly
demonstrates the strong effect of adsorbate migration on the quality factors of

time evolution of the momentum distribution of such quasi-particles when they
are initially prepared in a quasi-monochromatic wave packet with a given mean
momentum. The parallel transport of the pseudo-spin degree of freedom along
scattering paths in momentum space generates a geometrical phase which alters
the interference associated with reciprocal scattering paths. In the massless
case, a well-known dip in the momentum distribution develops at backscattering
(respective to the Dirac point considered) around the transport mean free time.
This dip later vanishes in the honeycomb case because of trigonal warping. In
the massive case, the dynamical phase of the scattering paths becomes crucial.
Its interplay with the geometrical phase induces an additional transient broken
reflection symmetry in the momentum distribution. The direction of this
asymmetry is a property of the Dirac point considered, independent of the
energy of the wave packet. These Berry phase effects could be observed in
current cold atom lattice experiments.

distance traveled by the robots until they all reach an equal number of static

condition under which true distance optimality can be achieved for robots with
limited communication and target-sensing ranges. Moreover, we provide an
explicit, non-asymptotic formula for computing the number of robots needed to
achieve distance optimality in terms of the robots' communication and
target-sensing ranges with arbitrary guaranteed probabilities. The same bounds

  In the second half of the paper, we present suboptimal strategies for use
when the number of robots cannot be chosen freely. Assuming first that all
targets are known to all robots, we employ a hierarchical communication model
in which robots communicate only with other robots in the same partitioned
region. This hierarchical communication model leads to constant approximations
of true distance-optimal solutions under mild assumptions. We then revisit the
limited communication and sensing models. By combining simple rendezvous-based
strategies with a hierarchical communication model, we obtain decentralized
hierarchical strategies that achieve constant approximation ratios with respect
to true distance optimality. Results of simulation show that the approximation
ratio is as low as 1.4.

therapies, combination vaccines/chemicals, and plants carrying multigenic
resistance requires an understanding of how their population-wide deployment
affects the speed of the pathogen adaptation. Here, we develop a stochastic
model describing the emergence of a mutant pathogen and its dynamics in a
heterogeneous host population split into various types by the management
strategy. Based on a multi-type Markov birth and death process, the model can
be used to provide a basic understanding of how the life-cycle parameters of
the pathogen population, and the controllable parameters of a management
strategy affect the speed at which a pathogen adapts to a multicomponent
treatment. Our results reveal the importance of coupling stochastic mutation
and migration processes, and illustrate how their stochasticity can alter our
view of the principles of managing pathogen adaptive dynamics at the population
level. In particular, we identify the growth and migration rates that allow
pathogens to adapt to a multicomponent treatment even if it is deployed on only
small proportions of the host. In contrast to the accepted view, our model
suggests that treatment durability should not systematically be identified with
mutation cost. We show also that associating a multicomponent treatment with
defeated monocomponent treatments can be more durable than associating it with
intermediate treatments including only some of the components. We conclude that
the explicit modelling of stochastic processes underlying evolutionary dynamics
could help to elucidate the principles of the sustainable use of multicomponent
treatments in population-wide management strategies intended to impede the
evolution of harmful populations.

dynamics and the onset of the instability. In particular, we perform
ideal-magnetohydrodynamics simulations of neutron stars that are known to be
either stable or unstable against the purely hydrodynamical instability, but to
which a poloidal magnetic field in the range of $10^{14}$--$10^{16}$ G is
superimposed initially. As expected, the differential rotation is responsible
for the shearing of the poloidal field and the consequent linear growth in time
of the toroidal magnetic field. The latter rapidly exceeds in strength the
original poloidal one, leading to a magnetic-field amplification in the the
stars. Weak initial magnetic fields, i.e. $ \lesssim 10^{15}$ G, have
negligible effects on the development of the dynamical bar-mode instability,
simply braking the stellar configuration via magnetic-field shearing, and over
a timescale for which we derived a simple algebraic expression. On the other
hand, strong magnetic fields, i.e. $\gtrsim 10^{16}$ G, can suppress the
instability completely, with the precise threshold being dependent also on the
amount of rotation. As a result, it is unlikely that very highly magnetized
neutron stars can be considered as sources of gravitational waves via the
dynamical bar-mode instability.

a negative $t_2$ reduces it. It is also found that, for a fixed temperature,
increasing the quasi-disorder strength reduces the condensate fraction in the

efficiency of hybridized DG methods. Hybridization of finite element
discretizations has the main advantage, that the resulting set of algebraic
equations has globally coupled degrees of freedom only on the skeleton of the
computational mesh. Consequently, solving for these degrees of freedom involves
the solution of a potentially much smaller system. This not only reduces
storage requirements, but also allows for a faster solution with iterative
solvers. Using a discrete-adjoint approach, sensitivities with respect to
output functionals are computed to drive the adaptation. From the error
distribution given by the adjoint-based error estimator, h- or p-refinement is
chosen based on the smoothness of the solution which can be quantified by
properly-chosen smoothness indicators. Numerical results are shown for
subsonic, transonic, and supersonic flow around the NACA0012 airfoil.
hp-adaptation proves to be superior to pure h-adaptation if discontinuous or
singular flow features are involved. In all cases, a higher polynomial degree
turns out to be beneficial. We show that for polynomial degree of approximation
p=2 and higher, and for a broad range of test cases, HDG performs better than
DG in terms of runtime and memory requirements.

  We present the opinion dynamics of a society of reasonable contrarian agents.
The model is a cellular automaton of Ising type, with antiferromagnetic pair

We introduce the entropy of the collective variable as a way of comparing

  In the mean field approximation the model exhibits bifurcations and a chaotic
phase, interpreted as coherent oscillations of the whole society. However, in a
one-dimensional spatial arrangement one observes incoherent oscillations and a
constant average.
  In simulations on Watts-Strogatz networks with a small-world effect the mean

$\mathbb{R}^d$ into $k$ clusters is one of the most popular and widely spread
clustering methods. The need to respect prescribed lower bounds on the cluster
sizes has been observed in many scientific and business applications.
  In this paper, we present and analyze a generalization of $k$-means that is
capable of handling weighted point sets and prescribed lower and upper bounds
on the cluster sizes. We call it weight-balanced $k$-means. The key difference
to existing models lies in the ability to handle the combination of weighted
point sets with prescribed bounds on the cluster sizes. This imposes the need
to perform partial membership clustering, and leads to significant differences.
  For example, while finite termination of all $k$-means variants for
unweighted point sets is a simple consequence of the existence of only finitely
many partitions of a given set of points, the situation is more involved for
weighted point sets, as there are infinitely many partial membership
clusterings. Using polyhedral theory, we show that the number of iterations of
weight-balanced $k$-means is bounded above by $n^{O(dk)}$, so in particular it
is polynomial for fixed $k$ and $d$. This is similar to the known worst-case
upper bound for classical $k$-means for unweighted point sets and unrestricted
cluster sizes, despite the much more general framework. We conclude with the
discussion of some additional favorable properties of our method.

accurate calculation of forces and energies in interfacial and inhomogeneous
systems require long-range methods. The MLS method offers some significant
advantages compared to the particle-particle particle-mesh and smooth particle
mesh Ewald methods. Unlike mesh-based Ewald methods, MLS does not use fast
Fourier transforms and is thus not limited by communication and bandwidth
concerns. In addition, it scales linearly in the number of particles, as
compared with the $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$ complexity of the mesh-based Ewald
methods. While the structure of the MLS method is invariant for different
potentials, every algorithmic step had to be adapted to accommodate the
$r^{-6}$ form of the dispersion interactions. In addition, we have derived
error bounds, similar to those obtained by Hardy for the electrostatic MLS

they optimally choose the participants from a large population of strategic

this paper, we address these questions and present a novel mechanism,
SeqTGreedy, for budgeted recruitment of participants in community sensing. We
first show that privacy tradeoffs in community sensing can be cast as an
adaptive submodular optimization problem. We then design a budget feasible,
incentive compatible (truthful) mechanism for adaptive submodular maximization,
which achieves near-optimal utility for a large class of sensing applications.

simplicity, though the nature of the problem is very general) and non-compact
time. Due to backreaction induced by the presence of even a single string
quantum, the usual formulation of perturbative string theory in a fixed
classical background is infrared-divergent at all subleading orders in the
string coupling, and needs to be amended. The problem can be seen as a closed
string analogue of D0-brane recoil under an impact by closed strings (a
situation displaying extremely similar infrared divergences). Inspired by the
collective coordinate treatment of the D0-brane recoil, whereby the
translational modes of the D0-brane are introduced as explicit dynamical
variables in the path integral, we construct a similar formalism for the case
of string-induced gravitational backreaction, in which the spatially uniform
modes of the background fields on the compact space are quantized explicitly.
The formalism can equally well be seen as an ultraviolet completion of a
minisuperspace quantum cosmology with string degrees of freedom. We consider

expected from broadening in a wind, in particular that the iron line width
should increase with an increase in the column density of the absorber (due to
an increase in the number of scatterings). We study the data from three neutron

(""CQ"") queries posed on relational data are combined-semantics equivalent [9].
We continue the tradition of [2,5,9] of studying this problem using the tool of
containment between queries. We introduce a syntactic necessary and sufficient
condition for equivalence of queries belonging to a large natural language of
""explicit-wave"" combined-semantics CQ queries; this language encompasses (but
is not limited to) all set, bag, and bag-set queries, and appears to cover all
combined-semantics CQ queries that are expressible in SQL. Our result solves in
the positive the decidability problem of determining combined-semantics
equivalence for pairs of explicit-wave CQ queries. That is, for an arbitrary
pair of combined-semantics CQ queries, it is decidable (i) to determine whether
each of the queries is explicit wave, and (ii) to determine, in case both
queries are explicit wave, whether or not they are combined-semantics
equivalent, by using our syntactic criterion. (The problem of determining
equivalence for general combined-semantics CQ queries remains open. Even so,
our syntactic sufficient containment condition could still be used to determine
that two general CQ queries are combined-semantics equivalent.) Our equivalence
test, as well as our general sufficient condition for containment of
combined-semantics CQ queries, reduce correctly to the special cases reported
in [2,5] for set, bag, and bag-set semantics. Our containment and equivalence
conditions also properly generalize the results of [9], provided that the
latter are restricted to the language of (combined-semantics) CQ queries.

theorem of Ruh-Vilms in the Euclidean space to symmetric spaces and, secondly,
to apply this result to extend Hoffman-Osserman-Schoen Theorem (HOS Theorem) to
3-dimensional symmetric spaces. Precisely, it is defined a Gauss map of a
hypersurface M^{n-1} immersed in a symmetric space N^n taking values in the
unit pseudo sphere S^m of the Lie algebra g of the isometry group of N,
dim(g)=m+1, and it is proved that M has CMC if and only if its Gauss map is
harmonic. As an application, it is proved that if dim(N)=3 and the image of the
Gauss map of a CMC surface S immersed in N is contained in a hemisphere of S^m
determined by a vector X, then S is invariant by the one parameter subgroup of
isometries of N of the Killing field determined by X. In particular, it is
obtained an extension of HOS Theorem to the 3-dimensional hyperbolic space.
  In the paper it is also shown that the holomorphic quadratic form induced by
the Gauss map coincides (up to a sign) with the Hopf quadratic form when the
ambient space is a space form and with the Abresch-Rosenberg quadratic form
when the ambient space is H^2 x R and S^2 x R providing, then, an unified way
of relating Hopf's and Abresch-Rosenberg's quadratic form with the quadratic
form induced by a harmonic Gauss map of a CMC surface in these 5 spaces.

PtIrCo show higher selectivity for H2O2 formation than unalloyed Pt, they did
not contribute to membrane degradation. This result is explained in terms of
catalyst stability as measured in potential cycling tests in liquid electrolyte
as well as in a functional PEM fuel cell.

time-dependent density functional theory generically displays dynamical step
structures. These have a spatially non-local and time-non-local dependence on
the density in real time dynamics. The steps are missing in the usual
approximations which consequently yield inaccurate dynamics. Yet these same
approximations typically yield good linear response spectra. Here we
investigate whether the steps appear in the linear response regime, when the
response is calculated from a real-time dynamics simulation, by examining the
exact correlation potential of model two-electron systems at various times. We
find there are no step structures in regions where the system response is
linear. Step structures appear in the correlation potential only in regions of
space where the density response is non-linear; these regions, having
exponentially small density, do not contribute to the observables measured in
linear response.

Comments welcome",,,,"gr-qc astro-ph.CO hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Phenomenological approaches to quantum gravity try to infer model-independent
laws by analyzing thought experiments and combining both quantum, relativistic,
and gravitational ingredients. We first review these ingredients -three basic
inequalities- and discuss their relationships with the nature of fundamental
constants. In particular, we argue for a covariant mass bound conjecture: in a
spacetime free of horizon, the mass inside a surface $A$ cannot exceed $16 \pi
G^2 m^2< A $, while the reverse holds in a spacetime with horizons. This is
given a precise definition using the formalism of light-sheets. We show that
$\hbar/c$ may be also given a geometrical interpretation, namely $4 \pi
\hbar^2/m^2< A$. We then combine these inequalities and find/review the
following: (1) Any system must have a size greater than the Planck length, in
the sense that there exists a minimal area (2) We comment on the Minimal Length
Scenarios and the fate of Lorentz symmetry near the Planck scale (3) Quanta
with transplanckian frequencies are allowed in a large enough boxes (4) There
exists a mass-dependent maximal acceleration given by $m c^3/\hbar$ if $m<m_p$
and by $c^4/G m$ if $m>m_p$ (5) There exists a mass dependent maximal force and
power (6) There exists a maximal energy density and pressure (7) Physical
systems must obey the Holographic Principle (8) Holographic bounds can only be
saturated by systems with $m>m_p$; systems lying on the ``Compton line'' $l
\sim 1/m$ are fundamental objects without substructures (9) We speculate on a
new bound from above for the action. In passing, we note that the maximal
acceleration is of the order of Milgrom's acceleration $a_0$ for ultra-light
particles ($m\sim H_0)$ that could be associated to the Dark Energy fluid. This
suggests designing toy-models in which modified gravity in galaxies is driven
by the DE field, via the maximal acceleration principle.

magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) turbulence between the Sun and the Alfv\'en critical
point. These are the first such simulations that take into account the
solar-wind outflow velocity and the radial inhomogeneity of the background
solar wind without approximating the nonlinear terms in the governing
equations. RMHD turbulence is driven by outward-propagating Alfv\'en waves
($z^+$ fluctuations) launched from the Sun, which undergo partial non-WKB
reflection to produce sunward-propagating Alfv\'en waves ($z^-$ fluctuations).
We present ten simulations with different values of the correlation time
$\tau_{\rm c\,\sun}^+$ and perpendicular correlation length $L_{\perp \sun}$ of
outward-propagating Alfv\'en waves (AWs) at the coronal base. We find that
between 15% and 33% of the $z^+$ energy launched into the corona dissipates
between the coronal base and Alfv\'en critical point. Between 33% and 40% of
this input energy goes into work on the solar-wind outflow, and between 22% and
36% escapes as $z^+$ fluctuations through the simulation boundary at $r=r_{\rm
A}$. The $z^\pm$ power spectra scale like $k_\perp^{-\alpha^\pm}$, where
$k_\perp$ is the wavenumber in the plane perpendicular to $\vec{B}_0$. In our
simulation with the smallest value of $\tau_{\rm c\,\sun}^+$ ($\sim 2
\mbox{min}$) and largest value of $L_{\perp \sun}$ ($2\times 10^4 \mbox{km}$),
we find that $\alpha^+$ decreases approximately linearly with increasing
$\ln(r)$, reaching a value of 1.3 at $r=11.1 R_{\sun}$. Our simulations with
larger values of $\tau_{\rm c\,\sun}^+$ exhibit alignment between the contours
of constant $\phi^+$, $\phi^-$, $\Omega_0^+$, and $\Omega_0^-$, where

though a vacancy is not classified as a topological defect in KM model, it
generally induces a pair of degenerate midgap states only in the TI phase. We
show that these midgap states results from edge states that fit into vacancies
and are characterized by the same Z$_{2}$ topological order. Furthermore, in
the presence of many vacancies, an impurity band that is degenerate with edge
states in energy is induced and mixes directly with edge states. However, the
Z$_{2}$ topological order persists and edge states exist between the impurity
band and perturbed bulk bands until a phase transition occurs when Dirac cones
near Dirac points are depleted. Our analyses indicate that the same scenario

reversing both the carrier type and the magnetic field gives rise to the same

to Kibble Zurek type scaling behavior. For the AdS soliton the system is

describe the non-equilibrium dynamics around quantum critical points with
arbitrary dynamical critical exponent $z$ and correlation length exponent

junior doctors to hospitals based on their preferences over one another. In an
instance of this problem, a stable matching M is sought which ensures that no
blocking pair can exist in which a resident r and hospital h can improve
relative to M by becoming assigned to each other. Such a situation is
undesirable as it could naturally lead to r and h forming a private arrangement
outside of the matching. The original HR model assumes that preference lists
are strictly ordered. However in practice, this may be an unreasonable
assumption: an agent may find two or more agents equally acceptable, giving
rise to ties in its preference list. We thus obtain the Hospitals/Residents
problem with Ties (HRT). In such an instance, stable matchings may have
different sizes and MAX HRT, the problem of finding a maximum cardinality
stable matching, is NP-hard. In this paper we describe an Integer Programming
(IP) model for MAX HRT. We also provide some details on the implementation of
the model. Finally we present results obtained from an empirical evaluation of
the IP model based on real-world and randomly generated problem instances.

programming under the well-founded semantics. It is an extension of the
language of Flora-2 and so supports inheritance and other object-oriented
features, as well as the higher-order syntax of Hilog. However, Rulelog rules
may also contain quantifiers and may be contra-positional. In addition, these
rules are evaluated in the presence of defeasibility mechanisms that include
rule cancellation, rule priorities, and other aspects. Rulelog programs are
sometimes developed by loosely coordinated teams of knowledge engineers (KEs)
who are not necessarily programmers. This requires not only declarative
debugging support, but also support for profiling to help KEs understand the
overall structure of a computation, including its termination properties. The
design of debugging and profiling tools is made more challenging because
Rulelog programs undergo a series of transformations into normal programs, so
that there is a cognitive distance between how rules are specified and how they
are executed.
  In this paper, we describe the debugging and profiling environment for
Rulelog implemented in the integrated development environment of the Silk
system. Our approach includes an interface to justification graphs, which treat
why-not and defeasibility as well as provenance of the rules supporting
answers. It also includes tools for trace-based analysis of computations to
permit understanding of erroneous non-termination and of general performance
issues. For semantically correct cases of the non-terminating behavior, Silk
offers a different approach, which addresses the problem in a formally sound
manner by leveraging a form of bounded rationality called restraint.

knowledge about the environment as soon as possible, thus every effort to
expand the knowledge horizon is useful. Otherwise critical information may not
reach nodes far from the source causing dangerous misbehaviour of the swarm. We
consider two extreme situations. In the first scenario we have an unique
probabilistic delay distribution. In the second scenario, each agent is subject
to a different truncated gaussian distribution, meaning local conditions are
significantly different from link to link. We study how several swarm
topologies react to the two scenarios and how to allocate the more efficient
transmission resources in order to expand the horizon. Results show that
significant time savings under a gossip-like protocol are possible properly

licensing regulations in the E-band. Subsequently, different propagation
models, e.g., the ITU-R and Cane models, are compared against measurement

E-band wireless systems may need to be designed with larger fade margins
compared to microwave systems. A similar comparison is carried out between
measurements and models for oscillator phase noise. It is confirmed that phase
noise characteristics, that are neglected by the models used for narrowband
systems, need to be taken into account for the wideband systems deployed in the
E-band. Next, a new multi-input multi-output (MIMO) transceiver design, termed

modulation conditions for cosmic rays were unusual compared to previous solar
minimum periods. The highest spectra of galactic protons (and other cosmic
rays) were recorded by the PAMELA instrument at Earth in late 2009, in contrast
to expectations. The spectrum, between 100 MeV and 50 GeV, for December 2009 is
compared to proton spectra observed during previous solar minimum periods, back
to 1965. Corresponding numerical modeling is presented which predicts that the
next solar minimum spectra could even be higher if similar modulation
conditions then would occur as in 2008-2009. The reason is that incorporating
gradient and curvature drifts in modulation models causes proton spectra for A
> 0 solar magnetic cycles (e.g., around 1976, 1997) to always be higher than
during A < 0 cycles (e.g. around 1965, 1987, 2009) at energies below a few GeV,
if the same modulation conditions would prevail.

metasilicate $Li_2SiO_3$, a network forming ionic glass, by means of molecular

tetrahedra disrupted by $Li$ ions which diffuse through the network. Measures
of mean square displacement of $Si$ and $O$ atoms allow us to identify a
temperature at which tetrahedra stop moving relative to each other. This
temperature $T_c\approx 1500\,K$ can be characterized within the framework of
mode coupling theory. At a much lower temperature $T_g\approx 1000\,K$, a
change in the slope of the volume versus temperature data allows to single out
the glass transition. We find signatures of both transitions in structural
order parameters, related to the orientation of tetrahedra. Going down in
temperature we find that, around the mode coupling transition temperature, a
set of order parameters which measure the relative orientation of tetrahedra
cease to increase and stay constant below $T_c$. Another well known measure of
orientational order, the bond orientational order parameter, which in the
studied system measures local order within single tetrahedrons, is found to
continue growing below $T_c$ until $T_g$, below which it remains constant. Our
results allow to relate two characteristic dynamic transitions with
corresponding structural transitions, as observed in two different
orientational order parameters. Furthermore, the results indicate that the
network of thetrahedra continue to relax well below the point where neighboring
tetrahedra cannot rearrange relative to each other, and the glass is reached
only upon a process of relaxation of atoms which form the thetrahedron, as

As shown by this study, its fortuitous membership in a nearby resolved triple

Galactic low- to intermediate-mass (1.3 to 8 Msun) rotating stars from the

on the observed properties of the \alpha Herculis stars, we constrain the age

Her lies in the range 2.175 <= M/Msun <= 3.250. We compare our model-based age

uniformly simultaneously continuous retraction from $X^*$ onto $B_{X^*}$
exists. It is also shown that if $\{X_i\}$ is a family of separable Banach
spaces whose duals are uniformly convex with moduli of convexity
$\delta_i(\varepsilon)$ such that $\inf_i \delta_i(\varepsilon)>0$ and $X=
\left[\bigoplus X_i\right]_{c_0}$ or $X=\left[\bigoplus X_i\right]_{\ell_p}$
for $1\le p<\infty$, then a uniformly simultaneously continuous retraction
exists from $X^*$ onto $B_{X^*}$.
  The relation between the existence of a uniformly simultaneously continuous
retraction and the Bishsop-Phelps-Bollob\'as property for operators is
investigated and it is proved that the existence of a uniformly simultaneously
continuous retraction from $X^*$ onto its unit ball implies that a pair $(X,
C_0(K))$ has the Bishop-Phelps-Bollob\'as property for every locally compact
Hausdorff spaces $K$. As a corollary, we prove that $(C_0(S), C_0(K))$ has the
Bishop-Phelps-Bollob\'as property if $C_0(S)$ and $C_0(K)$ are the spaces of
all real-valued continuous functions vanishing at infinity on locally compact
metric space $S$ and locally compact Hausdorff space $K$ respectively.

in VP can be computed by a depth-4 circuit of size 2^{O(\sqrt{n}\log n)}. So to
prove VP not equal to VNP, it is sufficient to show that an explicit polynomial
in VNP of degree n requires 2^{\omega(\sqrt{n}\log n)} size depth-4 circuits.
Soon after Tavenas's result, for two different explicit polynomials, depth-4
circuit size lower bounds of 2^{\Omega(\sqrt{n}\log n)} have been proved Kayal
et al. and Fournier et al. In particular, using combinatorial design Kayal et
al.\ construct an explicit polynomial in VNP that requires depth-4 circuits of
size 2^{\Omega(\sqrt{n}\log n)} and Fournier et al.\ show that iterated matrix
multiplication polynomial (which is in VP) also requires 2^{\Omega(\sqrt{n}\log
n)} size depth-4 circuits.
  In this paper, we identify a simple combinatorial property such that any
polynomial f that satisfies the property would achieve similar circuit size
lower bound for depth-4 circuits. In particular, it does not matter whether f
is in VP or in VNP. As a result, we get a very simple unified lower bound
analysis for the above mentioned polynomials.
  Another goal of this paper is to compare between our current knowledge of
depth-4 circuit size lower bounds and determinantal complexity lower bounds. We
prove the that the determinantal complexity of iterated matrix multiplication
polynomial is \Omega(dn) where d is the number of matrices and n is the
dimension of the matrices. So for d=n, we get that the iterated matrix
multiplication polynomial achieves the current best known lower bounds in both
fronts: depth-4 circuit size and determinantal complexity. To the best of our
knowledge, a \Theta(n) bound for the determinantal complexity for the iterated
matrix multiplication polynomial was known only for constant d>1 by Jansen.

the total number of ejected compact objects, 30 per cent of them are in
binaries. Merging time-scales of ejected binaries, which depend on the
cluster's velocity dispersion, are in some cases shorter than the age of the
universe. During the merging event, these dynamically formed compact mergers
are expected to produce gravitational waves that can be detectable by the
advanced ground-based interferometers. Based on our reference assumptions,
merger rates of ejected BH-BH and NS-NS binaries per globular cluster are
estimated to be 2.5 and 0.27 per Gyr, respectively. Assuming the spatial
density of globular clusters to be 8.4 h^3 clusters Mpc^-3 and extrapolating
the merger rate estimates to the horizon distance of the advanced LIGO-Virgo

has been a central open problem in the study of algebraic property testing.
Triangle-freeness in Boolean functions is a simple property whose testing
complexity is unknown. Three Boolean functions $f_1$, $f_2$ and $f_3:
\mathbb{F}_2^k \to \{0, 1\}$ are said to be triangle free if there is no $x, y
\in \mathbb{F}_2^k$ such that $f_1(x) = f_2(y) = f_3(x + y) = 1$. This property
is known to be strongly testable (Green 2005), but the number of queries needed
is upper-bounded only by a tower of twos whose height is polynomial in $1 /
\epsislon$, where $\epsislon$ is the distance between the tested function
triple and triangle-freeness, i.e., the minimum fraction of function values
that need to be modified to make the triple triangle free. A lower bound of $(1
/ \epsilon)^{2.423}$ for any one-sided tester was given by Bhattacharyya and
Xie (2010). In this work we improve this bound to $(1 / \epsilon)^{6.619}$.
Interestingly, we prove this by way of a combinatorial construction called
\emph{uniquely solvable puzzles} that was at the heart of Coppersmith and
Winograd's renowned matrix multiplication algorithm.

spatially flat FRW solutions in massive gravity with an FRW reference metric
and for bigravity theories. This bound comes from the requirement that the
kinetic term of the helicity zero mode of the graviton is positive definite.
The bound is dependent only on the parameters in the massive gravity potential
and the Hubble expansion rate for the two metrics. We derive the decoupling
limit of bigravity and FRW massive gravity, and use this to give an independent
derivation of the cosmological bound. We recover our previous results that the
tension between satisfying the Friedmann equation and the cosmological bound is
sufficient to rule out all observationally relevant FRW solutions for massive
gravity with an FRW reference metric. In contrast, in bigravity this tension is
resolved due to different nature of the Vainshtein mechanism. We find that in
bigravity theories there exists an FRW solution with late time
self-acceleration for which the kinetic terms for the helicity-2, helicity-1
and helicity-0 are generically nonzero and positive making this a compelling
candidate for a model of cosmic acceleration. We confirm that the generalized
bound is saturated for the candidate partially massless (bi)gravity theories

the conjectured partially massless symmetry for both massive gravity and
bigravity.

dots coupled to perfect conducting leads and to a finite chain of N
non-interacting sites connecting both of them. The inter-dot chain strongly
influences the transport across the system and the Local Density of States of
the dots. We study the case of small number of sites, so that Kondo box effects
are present, varying the coupling between the dots and the chain. For odd N and
small coupling between the inter-dot chain and the dots, a state with two
coexisting Kondo regimes develops: the bulk Kondo due to the quantum dots
connected to leads and the one produced by the screening of the quantum dots
spins by the spin in the finite chain at the Fermi level. As the coupling to
the inter-dot chain increases, there is a crossover to a molecular Kondo
effect, due to the screening of the molecule (formed by the finite chain and
the quantum dots) spin by the leads. For even N the two-Kondo temperatures
regime does not develop and the physics is dominated by the usual competition
between Kondo and antiferromagnetism between the quantum dots. We finally study
how the transport properties are affected as N is increased. For the study we
used exact multi-configurational Lanczos calculations and finite U slave-boson
mean-field theory at T = 0. The results obtained with both methods describe
qualitatively and also quantitatively the same physics.

regions of mixed quark-hadron (quark-hybrid) matter in high-mass neutron stars
with masses of 2.1 to 2.4 M_Sun. Pure quark matter in the cores of neutron
stars is obtained for certain parametrizations of the hadronic lagrangian and

velocity contrast (or velocity gradient) between the various layers as well as
the basin edge effects. In this work, the seismic ground motion in a deep
alpine valley (Grenoble basin, French Alps) is investigated through various
'classical' Boundary Element models. This deep valley has a peculiar geometry
(""Y""-shaped) and involves a strong velocity gradient between surface geological
structures. In the framework of a numerical benchmark [21-23], a representative
cross section of the valley has been proposed to investigate 2D site effects
through various numerical methods. The 'classical' Boundary Element Method is
considered herein to model the strong velocity gradient with a 2D piecewise
homogeneous medium. For a large incidence angle, the transfer functions
estimated from plane SH waves are close to the one computed with shallow SH
point sources. The fundamental frequency is estimated at 0.33 Hz (SH wave) and
the agreement with previous experimental results (spectral ratios) is good.
Comparisons between 1D and 2D amplification are then performed: the values of
the fundamental frequency and the corresponding amplitude are larger in 2D.
Converting frequency domain results into the time domain, we underline surface
waves generated at the valley edges and the directivity effect for the
amplified wave-field. In the time domain for plane SV-wave, we also computed
the ground motion for a strong seismic event (M=6): time duration and peak
ground velocity are found to be 3 times larger than for the input signal. Such
2D models involving basin effects are then capable to recover the high
amplification level measured in the field. Nevertheless, to deal with complex
3D basins as also proposed in the ""ESG"" benchmark [21-23], the capabilities of
the classical Boundary Element Method are limited. As shown recently
[43,47,52], such improvements as the fast multipole formulation (FM-BEM) may be
a promising alternative for future 3D simulations.

well understood, the source and entity of viscosity is still very uncertain. We
propose here to study white dwarf viscous properties using short period (< 1
hr), detached white dwarf binaries, such as the newly discovered ~12.8 min
system. These binaries are wide enough that mass transfer has not yet started
but close enough that the least massive component is subject to a measurable
tidal deformation. The associated tidal torque transfers orbital energy, which
is partially converted into heat by the action of viscosity within the deformed
star. As a consequence, its outer non-degenerate layers expand, and the star
puffs up. We self-consistently calculate the fractional change in radius, and
the degree of asynchronism (ratio of stellar to orbital spin) as a function of
the viscous time. Specializing our calculations to J0651, we find that the
discrepancy between the measured radius of the secondary star and He white
dwarf model predictions can be interpreted as tidal inflation if the viscous
timescale is either ~2 10^5 yr or ~10^4 yr. Such values point to a
non-microscopic viscosity, possibly given by tidally induced turbulence, or by
magnetic field stresses with a magnetic field strength of 10-100 Gauss.
Fortunately, these two timescales produce very different degree of
asynchronism, with the shortest one, bringing the system much closer to
synchronisation. A measurement of the stellar spin can thus univocally
determined the mean viscosity. Extrapolating the secondary's radial expansion,
we predict that the star will fill is Roche lobe at a separation which is
1.2-1.3 smaller than the current one. Applying this method to a future sample
of systems can allow us to learn whether viscosity changes with mass and/or
nuclear composition.

systems with lower mass ratios have more total angular momentum and as a result
more mass is flung out in a tidal tail. Nuclear burning can affect the amount
of mass ejected. Many WD binaries that contain a helium-rich WD achieve the
conditions to trigger a detonation. In contrast, for carbon-oxygen transferring
systems only the most massive mergers with a total mass above ~2.1 solar masses
detonate. Even systems with lower mass may detonate long after the merger if
the remnant remains above the Chandrasekhar mass and carbon is ignited at the

with orbital periods of order tens of days. This means that the effects of
rotation on atmospheric dynamics will be relatively weak, which requires small
horizontal temperature gradients above the boundary layer of terrestrial
atmospheres. An analytically solvable and dynamically consistent model for
planetary climate with only three free parameters can be constructed by making
the weak temperature gradient (WTG) approximation, which assumes temperatures
are horizontally uniform aloft. The extreme numerical efficiency of a WTG model
compared to a 3D general circulation model (GCM) makes it an optimal tool for
Monte Carlo fits to observables over parameter space. Additionally, such
low-order models are critical for developing physical intuition and coupling
atmospheric dynamics to models of other components of planetary climate. The
objective of this paper is to determine whether a WTG model provides an
adequate approximation of the effect of atmospheric dynamics on quantities
likely to be observed over the next decade. To do this we first tune a WTG
model to GCM output for an Earth-like tidally locked planet with a dry, 1 bar
atmosphere, then generate and compare the expected phase curves of both models.
We find that differences between the two models would be extremely difficult to
detect from phase curves using JWST. This result demonstrates the usefulness of
the WTG approximation when used in conjunction with GCMs as part of a modeling
hierarchy to understand the climate of remote planets.

results with the timing and spectral correlations seen in stellar-mass black
hole systems, and find that the qualitative nature of the timing and spectral

exhibiting Type-C QPOs. However, in order for this analogy to quantitatively
hold we must only be seeing the so-called saturated portion of the QPO

we place a lower limit on the mass of NGC 5408 X-1 of > 800 solar masses.
Alternatively, the QPO frequency is largely independent of the spectral
parameters, in which case a close analogy with the Type-C QPOs in stellar
systems is problematic. Measurement of the source's timing properties over a
wider range of energy spectral index is needed to definitively resolve this
ambiguity. We searched all the available data for both a broad Fe emission line

place upper limits on the equivalent width of any Fe emission feature in the 6

cosmological model: the contributions of mergers with different
halo-to-main-cluster mass ratios to cluster-sized halo growth. We perform this
test by dynamically analyzing seven galaxy clusters, spanning the redshift
range $0.13 < z_c < 0.45$ and caustic mass range $0.4-1.5$ $10^{15}
h_{0.73}^{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$, with an average of 293 spectroscopically-confirmed
bound galaxies to each cluster. The large radial coverage (a few virial radii),
which covers the whole infall region, with a high number of spectroscopically
identified galaxies enables this new study. For each cluster, we identify bound
galaxies. Out of these galaxies, we identify infalling and accreted halos and
estimate their masses and their dynamical states. Using the estimated masses,
we derive the contribution of different mass ratios to cluster-sized halo
growth. For mass ratios between ~0.2 and ~0.7, we find a ~1 $\sigma$ agreement
with \Lambda CDM expectations based on the Millennium simulations I and II. At
low mass ratios, $\lesssim 0.2$, our derived contribution is underestimated
since the detection efficiency decreases at low masses, $\sim 2 \times 10^{14}$
$h_{0.73}^{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$. At large mass ratios, $\gtrsim 0.7$, we do not
detect halos probably because our sample, which was chosen to be quite X-ray
relaxed, is biased against large mass ratios. Therefore, at large mass ratios,
the derived contribution is also underestimated.

We use the full GASS sample to investigate environmental effects on the cold
gas content of massive galaxies at fixed stellar mass. The environment is
characterized in terms of dark matter halo mass, obtained by cross-matching our
sample with the SDSS group catalog of Yang et al. Our analysis provides, for
the first time, clear statistical evidence that massive galaxies located in
halos with masses of 10^13-10^14 Msun have at least 0.4 dex less HI than
objects in lower density environments. The process responsible for the
suppression of gas in group galaxies most likely drives the observed quenching
of the star formation in these systems. Our findings strongly support the
importance of the group environment for galaxy evolution, and have profound
implications for semi-analytic models of galaxy formation, which currently do
not allow for stripping of the cold interstellar medium in galaxy groups.

its variable mHz quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) frequency and its hardness
ratio (5-10 keV/3-5 keV), an indicator of the energy spectral power-law index.
When stellar-mass black holes (StMBHs) exhibit Type-C low-frequency QPOs (~
0.2-15 Hz) the centroid frequency of the QPO is known to correlate with the
energy spectral index. The detection of such a correlation would strengthen the
identification of M82 X-1's mHz QPOs as Type-C and enable a more reliable mass
estimate by scaling its QPO frequencies to those of Type-C QPOs in StMBHs of
known mass. We resolved the count rates and the hardness ratios of M82 X-1 and
a nearby bright ULX (source 5/X42.3+59) through surface brightness modeling. We
detected QPOs in the frequency range of 36-210 mHz during which M82 X-1's
hardness ratio varied from 0.42-0.47. Our primary results are: (1) we do not
detect any correlation between the mHz QPO frequency and the hardness ratio (a
substitute for the energy spectral power-law index) and (2) similar to some
accreting X-ray binaries, we find that M82 X-1's mHz QPO frequency increases
with its X-ray count rate (Pearson's correlation coefficient = +0.97). The
apparent lack of a correlation between the QPO centroid frequency and the
hardness ratio poses a challenge to the earlier claims that the mHz QPOs of M82
X-1 are the analogs of the Type-C low-frequency QPOs of StMBHs. On the other
hand, it is possible that the observed relation between the hardness ratio and
the QPO frequency represents the saturated portion of the correlation seen in
Type-C QPOs of StMBHs -- in which case M82 X-1's mHz QPOs can still be
analogous to Type-C QPOs.

used only a part of the present data set. Our primary results are: (1) the
discovery of sharp, quasi-periodic, energy-independent dips in the X-ray

energy-dependent (variability amplitude decreases with increasing energy),
quasi-sinusoidal X-ray modulation with a period of 112.6+-4 days the amplitude
of which weakens during the second half of the light curve and (3) spectral
evidence for an increase in photoelectric absorption during the last continuous
segment of the data. We interpret the X-ray modulations within the context of
binary motion in analogy to that seen in high-inclination accreting X-ray
binaries. If correct, this implies that NGC 5408 X-1 is in a binary with an
orbital period of 243+-23 days, in contrast to the 115.5 day quasi-sinusoidal
period previously reported by Strohmayer (2009). We discuss the overall X-ray
modulation within the framework of accretion via Roche lobe overflow of the
donor star. In addition, if the X-ray modulation is caused by vertically
structured obscuring material in the accretion disk, this would imply a high
value for the inclination of the orbit. A comparison with estimates from
accreting X-ray binaries suggests an inclination > 70 degrees. We note that, in
principle, a precessing accretion disk could also produce the observed X-ray
modulations.

its 62 day X-ray period (Kaaret & Feng 2007). Based on its high coherence it
has been argued that the observed period is the orbital period of the binary.
Utilizing a much longer data set than in previous studies we find: (1) The
phase-resolved X-ray (3-15 keV) spectra -- modeled with a thermal accretion
disk and a power-law -- suggest that the accretion disk's contribution to the
total flux is strongly modulated with phase. (2) Suggestive evidence for a
sudden phase shift--of approximately 0.4 in phase (25 days)-- between the first
and the second halves of the light curve separated by roughly 1000 days. If
confirmed, the implied timescale to change the period is ~ 10 yrs, which is
exceptionally fast for an orbital phenomenon. These two independent pieces of
evidence are consistent with the periodicity being due to a precessing
accretion disk, similar to the super-orbital periods observed in systems like
Her X-1, LMC X-4, and SS433. However, the timing evidence for a change in the
period needs to be confirmed with additional observations. This should be
possible with further monitoring of M82 with instruments such as the Swift

from the central engine is responsible for an excess of soft X-ray radiation

connect this phenomenology with the birth of the most rapidly rotating

We report the discovery of 204, 45, and 13 Lyman-break galaxy candidates at
$z\sim6$, $z\sim7$, and $z\sim8$, respectively, identified from purely
photometric redshift selections. This large sample, representing nearly an
order of magnitude increase in the number of magnified star-forming galaxies at
$z\sim 6-8$ presented to date, is unique in that we have observations in four
WFC3/UVIS UV, seven ACS/WFC optical, and all five WFC3/IR broadband filters,
which enable very accurate photometric redshift selections. We construct
detailed lensing models for 17 of the 18 clusters to estimate object
magnifications and to identify two new multiply lensed $z \gtrsim 6$
candidates. The median magnifications over the 17 clusters are 4, 4, and 5 for
the $z\sim6$, $z\sim7$, and $z\sim8$ samples, respectively, over an average
area of 4.5 arcmin$^2$ per cluster. We compare our observed number counts with
expectations based on convolving ""blank"" field UV luminosity functions through
our cluster lens models and find rough agreement down to $\sim27$ mag, where we
begin to suffer significant incompleteness. In all three redshift bins, we find
a higher number density at brighter observed magnitudes than the field
predictions, empirically demonstrating for the first time the enhanced
efficiency of lensing clusters over field surveys. Our number counts also are
in general agreement with the lensed expectations from the cluster models,
especially at $z\sim6$, where we have the best statistics.

the entropy depends, as expected, on the asymptotic value of the dilaton. In
the extremal limit, the entropy is determined purely in terms of charges and is
independent of the asymptotic value of the dilaton. The attractor mechanism can
be used as a criterion for the existence of the regular solutions. Since there
is a `competition' between the effective potential and dilaton potential, we
also obtain regular extremal black hole solutions with just one U(1) gauge

requires a nonperturbative completion in order to be well defined. Recently,
within the context of random matrix models, it was shown how to build resurgent
transseries solutions encoding the full nonperturbative information beyond the
't Hooft genus expansion. On the other hand, via large N duality, random matrix
models may be holographically described by B-model closed topological strings
in local Calabi-Yau geometries. This raises the question of constructing the
corresponding holographically dual resurgent transseries, tantamount to
nonperturbative topological string theory. This paper addresses this point by
showing how to construct resurgent transseries solutions to the holomorphic
anomaly equations. These solutions are built upon (generalized) multi-instanton
sectors, where the instanton actions are holomorphic. The asymptotic expansions
around the multi-instanton sectors have both holomorphic and anti-holomorphic
dependence, may allow for resonance, and their structure is completely fixed by
the holomorphic anomaly equations in terms of specific polynomials multiplied
by exponential factors and up to the holomorphic ambiguities -- which
generalizes the known perturbative structure to the full transseries. In
particular, the anti-holomorphic dependence has a somewhat universal character.
Furthermore, in the nonperturbative sectors, holomorphic ambiguities may be
fixed at conifold points. This construction shows the nonperturbative
integrability of the holomorphic anomaly equations, and sets the ground to
start addressing large-order analysis and resurgent nonperturbative completions
within closed topological string theory.

the local dark matter (DM) distribution at the location of the Sun, with an
emphasis on the consequences for direct detection experiments. Our work is
based on a comparative analysis of two cosmological simulations of a Milky Way
halo: Eris, a full hydrodynamic simulation, and ErisDark, its DM-only
realization. We find that two distinct processes lead in Eris to a 30%
enhancement of DM in the disk plane at the location of the Sun: the accretion
and disruption of satellites resulting in a DM component with net angular
momentum and the contraction of baryons pulling DM into the disk plane without
forcing it to co-rotate. Owing to its particularly quiescent merger history for
dark halos of Milky Way mass, the co-rotating dark disk in Eris is less massive
than what has been suggested by previous work, contributing only 9% of the
local DM density. The speed distribution in Eris is broadened and shifted to
higher speeds compared to its DM-only twin simulation ErisDark. At high speeds
$f(v)$ falls more steeply in Eris than in ErisDark or the SHM, easing the
tension between recent results from the CDMS-II and XENON100 experiments. The
non-Maxwellian aspects of $f(v)$ are still present, but much less pronounced in
Eris than in DM-only runs. The weak dark disk increases the time-averaged
scattering rate by only a few percent at low recoil energies. On the high
velocity tail, however, the increase in typical speeds due to baryonic
contraction results in strongly enhanced mean scattering rates compared to
ErisDark, although they are still suppressed compared to the SHM. Similar
trends are seen regarding the amplitude of the annual modulation, while the
modulated fraction is increased compared to the SHM and decreased compared to
ErisDark.

overview what is known and not known about contemporary neutrino physics.
Theory tells us that neutrinos are the second-most common particle in the
Universe, behind only the quanta of radiation called photons. Almost a trillion
neutrinos per second enter each human eyeball, and yet we do not see them;
these neutrinos, in roughly equal numbers, are emanations from our Sun and
relics of the hot ""big bang"" era of the early Universe. Much of what we know
about neutrinos, and hope to learn in the future, is derived from a unique
feature of neutrinos -- ""oscillation"" among neutrino ""flavor"" types. An initial
neutrino flavor will in general oscillate into another flavor as the neutrino
propagates in space and time. Oscillations are a quantum mechanical phenomenon.
One of the wonders of neutrinos is that their quantum mechanics may be observed
over large distances, even astronomically large. We begin this article with
neutrino phenomenology in terms of masses and mixing angles, including the
matter-antimatter asymmetric ""phase"" that appears with three neutrino types.
Next we venture into neutrino oscillations. We conclude with a discussion of
model-building for the neutrino masses and mixings. Throughout this article,
attention is devoted to the 2012 result that the ""small"" neutrino mixing angle
is not so small, after all.

general, indicating that multiple physical processes are involved in. With the
GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite) observations, we find
that there are a subset of flares, whose impulsive phases are dominated by a
period of exponential growth of the emission measure. The flares occurred from
January 1999 to December 2002 are analyzed, and the results from the
observations made with both GOES 8 and GEOS 10 satellites are compared to
estimate the instrumental uncertainties. Their mean temperatures during this
exponential growth phase have a normal distribution. Most flares within the
1\sigma\ range of this temperature distribution belong to the GOES class B or
C, with the peak fluxes at the GOES low-energy channel following a log-normal
distribution. The growth rate and duration of the exponential growth phase also
follow a lognormal distribution, in which the duration is distributed in the
range from half a minute to about half an hour. As expected, the growth time is
correlated with the decay time of the soft X-ray flux. We also find that the
growth rate of the emission measure is strongly anti-correlated with the
duration of the exponential growth phase, and the mean temperature increases
slightly with the increase of the growth rate. The implications of these
results on the study of energy release in solar flares are discussed in the
end.

factor \Gamma = 2 \eta_0 \gamma_B in the direction of its initial bulk motion
and with characteristic opening angle \theta_0 ~ 1/\gamma_B. The flow is
jet-like with \Gamma \theta_0 ~ 2 \eta_0 such that jets with \Gamma >
1/\theta_0 are naturally produced. The choice \eta_0 ~ \gamma_B ~ 10 yields a

classical communication (LOCC). We begin by completing the \emph{perfect}
distinguishability problem of two-qubit ensembles - both for separable
operations and LOCC - by providing necessary and sufficient conditions for the
perfect discrimination of one pure and one mixed state. Then for the well-known
task of minimum error discrimination, it is shown that \textit{almost all}
two-qubit ensembles consisting of three pure states cannot be optimally
discriminated using LOCC. This is surprising considering that \textit{any} two
pure states can be distinguished optimally by LOCC. Special attention is given
to ensembles that lack entanglement, and we prove an easy sufficient condition
for when a set of three product states cannot be optimally distinguished by
LOCC, thus providing new examples of the phenomenon known as ""non-locality
without entanglement"". We next consider an example of $N$ parties who each
share the same state but who are ignorant of its identity. The state is drawn
from the rotationally invariant ""trine ensemble"", and we establish a tight
connection between the $N$-copy ensemble and Shor's ""lifted"" single-copy
ensemble. For any finite $N$, we prove that optimal identification of the
states cannot be achieved by LOCC; however as $N\to\infty$, LOCC can indeed
discriminate the states optimally. This is the first result of its kind.
Finally, we turn to the task of unambiguous discrimination and derive new lower
bounds on the LOCC inconclusive probability for symmetric states. When applied
to the double trine ensemble, this leads to a rather different
distinguishability character than when the minimum-error probability is
considered.

of all, our state is modeled by stochastic Volterra-type equation which leads
to some new study on stochastic ""integral"" system. This feature makes our setup
significantly different from the previous mean field games where the states
always follow some stochastic ""differential"" equations. Actually, our
stochastic integral system is rather general and can be viewed as natural
generalization of stochastic differential equations. In addition, it also
includes some types of stochastic delayed systems as its special cases. Second,
some new techniques are explored to tackle our mean-field LQG games due to the
special structure of integral system. For example, unlike the Riccati equation
in linear controlled differential system, some Fredholm-type equations are
introduced to characterize the consistency condition of our integral system via
the resolvent kernels. Third, based on the state aggregation technique, the
Nash certainty equivalence (NCE) equation is derived and the set of associated
decentralized controls are verified to satisfy the $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium
property. To this end, some new estimates of stochastic Volterra equations are
developed which also have their own interests.

formation histories (SFHs) is the bootstrap Monte Carlo, in which the
color-magnitude diagram (CMD) is repeatedly resampled. The variation in SFHs
measured from the resampled CMDs is assumed to represent the random uncertainty
in the SFH measured from the original data. However, this technique
systematically and significantly underestimates the uncertainties for times in
which the measured star formation rate is low or zero, leading to overly (and
incorrectly) high confidence in that measurement. This study proposes an
alternative technique, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which samples the
probability distribution of the parameters used in the original solution to
directly estimate confidence intervals. While the most commonly used MCMC
algorithms are incapable of adequately sampling a probability distribution that
can involve thousands of highly correlated dimensions, the Hybrid Monte Carlo
algorithm is shown to be extremely effective and efficient for this particular
task. Several implementation details, such as the handling of implicit priors
created by parameterization of the SFH, are discussed in detail.

to be brought into industrial use. A major challenge arises from the fact that
wireless channels introduce random packet dropouts. Power control and coding
are key enabling technologies in wireless communications to ensure efficient
communications. In the present work, we examine the role of power control and
coding for Kalman filtering over wireless correlated channels. Two estimation
architectures are considered: In the first, the sensors send their measurements
directly to a single gateway. In the second scheme, wireless relay nodes
provide additional links. The gateway decides on the coding scheme and the
transmitter power levels of the wireless nodes. The decision process is carried
out on-line and adapts to varying channel conditions in order to improve the
trade-off between state estimation accuracy and energy expenditure. In
combination with predictive power control, we investigate the use of
multiple-description coding, zero-error coding and network coding and provide
sufficient conditions for the expectation of the estimation error covariance
matrix to be bounded. Numerical results suggest that the proposed method may
lead to energy savings of around 50 %, when compared to an alternative scheme,
wherein transmission power levels and bit-rates are governed by simple logic.
In particular, zero-error coding is preferable at time instances with high
channel gains, whereas multiple-description coding is superior for time
instances with low gains. When channels between the sensors and the gateway are
in deep fades, network coding improves estimation accuracy significantly
without sacrificing energy efficiency.

  (Position Paper)",,,,,"cs.SI cs.CY cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Over the past decade, crowdsourcing has emerged as a cheap and efficient
method of obtaining solutions to simple tasks that are difficult for computers
to solve but possible for humans. The popularity and promise of crowdsourcing
markets has led to both empirical and theoretical research on the design of
algorithms to optimize various aspects of these markets, such as the pricing
and assignment of tasks. Much of the existing theoretical work on crowdsourcing
markets has focused on problems that fall into the broad category of online
decision making; task requesters or the crowdsourcing platform itself make
repeated decisions about prices to set, workers to filter out, problems to
assign to specific workers, or other things. Often these decisions are complex,
requiring algorithms that learn about the distribution of available tasks or
workers over time and take into account the strategic (or sometimes irrational)
behavior of workers.
  As human computation grows into its own field, the time is ripe to address
these challenges in a principled way. However, it appears very difficult to
capture all pertinent aspects of crowdsourcing markets in a single coherent
model. In this paper, we reflect on the modeling issues that inhibit
theoretical research on online decision making for crowdsourcing, and identify
some steps forward. This paper grew out of the authors' own frustration with
these issues, and we hope it will encourage the community to attempt to
understand, debate, and ultimately address them.
  The authors welcome feedback for future revisions of this paper.

This serves to compensate for the time steps when the processor is not
available to perform any control calculations. Using a stochastic Lyapunov
function based approach, we analyze the stability of the resulting closed loop
system for the cases when the processor availability can be modeled as an
independent and identically distributed sequence and via an underlying Markov
chain. Numerical simulations indicate that the increase in performance due to
the proposed algorithms can be significant.

calculated at the center of each cell. We confirm the previous finding that
local maxima in profit landscapes are scattered in a fractal-like fashion: The
number M of local maxima follows the power-law form $M \sim N^{a}$, but the
scaling exponent $a$ is found to differ for different time series. From
comparisons of real and artificial stock prices, we find that the fat-tailed
return distribution is closely related to the exponent $a \approx 1.6$ observed

role in forming a Neel-type domain wall that can be driven by the spin Hall
torque, a torque resulting from the spin current generated in a neighboring
non-magnetic layer via the spin Hall effect. Here we show that the sign of the
DMI, which determines the direction to which a domain wall moves with current,
can be changed by modifying the adjacent non-magnetic layer. We find that the
sense of rotation of a domain wall spiral is reversed when the Ta underlayer is
doped with nitrogen in Ta|CoFeB|MgO heterostructures. The spin Hall angle of
the Ta and nitrogen doped Ta underlayers carry the same sign, suggesting that
the sign of the DMI is defined at the interface. Depending on the sense of
rotation, spin transfer torque and spin Hall torque can either compete or
assist each other, thus influencing the efficiency of moving domain walls with
current.

supported by rotation and random motion. Most astrophysical discs, however, are
under the influence of an external gravitational field which can affect their
stability. A typical example is a galactic disc embedded in a dark matter halo.
Here we do a linear perturbation analysis for a disc in an external field, and
obtain a generalized dispersion relation and a modified stability criterion. An
external field has two effects on the disc dynamics: first, it contributes to
the unperturbed rotational field, and second, it adds a tidal field term in the
stability parameter. A typical disruptive tidal field results in a higher
modified Q value and hence leads to a more stable disc. We apply these results
to the Milky Way, and to a low surface brightness galaxy UGC 7321. We find that
in each case the stellar disc by itself is barely stable and it is the dark
matter halo that stabilizes the disc against local, axisymmetric gravitational
instabilities. This result has been largely missed so far because in practice
the value for Q for a galactic disc is obtained in a hybrid fashion using the
observed rotational field that is set by both the disc and the halo, and hence
is higher than for a pure disc.

an ionization equilibrium nor a non-equilibrium (ionizing) plasma model,
leaving saw-teeth residuals in the 1.5-3 keV energy band. The residual
structures can be produced when free electrons are recombined to the K-shells
of highly ionized Mg and Si ions. In fact, the X-ray spectrum is nicely fitted
with a recombination-dominant plasma model. We propose a scenario that the
plasma in nearly full ionized state at high temperature quickly changed to a
recombining phase due to selective cooling of electrons to a lower temperature
of ~0.5 keV. The spectrum of CXOU J171419.8-383023 is well explained by a
simple power-law model with a photon index of 1.9, nearly equal to the typical
value of pulsar wind nebulae. Since the distance is estimated to be the same as
that of the soft diffuse, we infer that both the soft diffuse and CXOU

hence derive an FPTAS for the partition function of the hard core model on such

uniqueness of the Gibbs measure of the hard core model on the infinite d-ary

approximated with high probability on graphs drawn from the random graph model
G(n,d/n) for all lambda < e/d, even though the maximum degree of such graphs is
unbounded with high probability.
  We also improve upon Weitz's bounds for strong spatial mixing on bounded
degree graphs (Weitz, 2006) by providing a computationally simple method which
uses known estimates of the connective constant of a lattice to obtain bounds
on the vertex activities lambda for which the hard core model on the lattice

Model for the charge transport the simulation of the time-of-flight
photo-current pulse shape was carried out for homogeneous and inhomogeneous
films by varying the overall energetic disorder of the system. In the case of
homogeneous system, the value of the tail broadening parameter (W) of the
photocurrent pulse is found to decrease upon decreasing the energetic disorder.
The observed behavior is explained by using the temporal evolution of carrier
diffusion coefficient. In case of the inhomogeneous system, upon decreasing the
overall energetic disorder of the system the value of W initially attained a
maximum before it started to decrease. This is attributed to the morphology
dependent carrier diffusion in the latter case. This study elicits the
importance of the influence of the film morphology induced carrier diffusion on
the experimentally measured shape of the time-of-flight transient photo-current

Results. We report new line detections of p-H2O (3_22-2_11) at 89.99 micron and
CO J=18-17 at 144.78 micron for the disk around TW Hya. Disk modeling shows
that the far-IR fine structure lines ([OI], [CII]) and molecular submm lines
are very robust to uncertainties in the chemistry, while the water line fluxes
can change by factors of a few. The water lines are optically thick,
sub-thermally excited and can couple to the background continuum radiation
field. The low-excitation water lines are also sensitive to uncertainties in
the collision rates, e.g. with neutral hydrogen. The gas temperature plays an
important role for the [OI] fine structure line fluxes, the water line fluxes
originating from the inner disk as well as the high excitation CO, CH+ and OH
lines. Conclusions. Due to their sensitivity on chemical input data and
radiative transfer, water lines have to be used cautiously for understanding
details of the disk structure. Water lines covering a wide range of excitation
energies provide access to the various gas phase water reservoirs (inside and
outside the snow line) in protoplanetary disks and thus provide important
information on where gas-phase water is potentially located. Experimental
and/or theoretical collision rates for H2O with atomic hydrogen are needed to
diminish uncertainties from water line radiative transfer.

on the formation of nuclear halos is studied in the framework of relativistic
continuum Hartree-Bogoliubov (RCHB) theory. It turns out that the contributions
from the weakly-bound orbits with low orbital angular momenta $l$ play an
important role. As an example, we investigate the neutron-rich Mg isotopes as a
function of the pairing strength in situations, where the neuron Fermi surface
are below, between and above two weakly-bound $2p$ levels. We find that the
size of the pairing correlations has a two-fold influence on the density
distribution of the neutrons and therefore on the total nuclear size. First it
can change the root mean square (rms) radius of the individual weakly-bound
orbits and second it can enhance the occupation probabilities of these orbits
in the nuclear system. On one side increasing pairing correlations reduce the
rms radii of the orbits with small orbital angular momenta close to the
continuum limit (pairing anti-halo effect), on the other side they also can
lead to an enhanced occupation of low-$l$ orbits above the Fermi surface
producing in this way a strong increase of the total radius of the nuclear
system. As a consequence, a nuclear halo can form even in cases, where non of
the individual low-$l$ orbits is very close to the continuum. This leads to the
fact that compared with well-bound nuclei, the impact of the pairing strength
on the nuclear size is more pronounced in weakly-bound nuclei than in
well-bound systems.

IceCube 79-string constraint on the same cross section, which was obtained by
searching for dark matter annihilations in the Sun. We compare this sensitivity
to dark matter direct detection results as well, in particular the XENON100

the search for dark matter annihilations in the Earth core provides competitive
constraints on $\sigma_p^{\rm SI}$ and $\langle \sigma\upsilon \rangle$ in the

demarcates liquid-like and gas-like configurations and the presence of

backpropagation of signals. In a cylindrical dendrite, signals moving in either
direction will be similar. However, if the dendrites taper, then this is not
the case any more. The picture gets more complex if the ion channel
distribution along the dendrite is also non-uniform. These equations have been
solved using the Chebyshev pseudo-spectral method. Here we look at non-uniform
dendritic voltage gated channels in both cylindrical and tapering dendrites.
For back-propagating signals, the signal is accentuated in the case of tapering
dendrites. We assume a Hodgkin-Huxley formulation of ion channels and solve
these equations with the compact finite-difference scheme. The scheme gives
spectral-like spatial resolution while being easier to solve than spectral
methods. We show that the scheme is able to reproduce the results obtained from
spectral methods. The compact difference scheme is widely used to study
turbulence in airflow, however it is being used for the first time in our

user is encountered by the system just once, receives a recommendation, and
either consumes or ignores it, registering a binary reward.

non-linear interactions between pairs of features. OFF-Set is designed for

accuracy. Hence, it is more accurate than minimum distance with 67% and
parallelepiped with 65%. On the other hand, based on bands features, and also
by combining several researchers' findings, a table was created which includes
the main objects on the land and the suitable combination of the bands for
accurately detecting of landcover objects. During this process, it was observed
that band 4 (out of 7 bands of Landsat 5TM) is the band, which can be used for
increasing the accuracy of the combined bands in detecting objects on the land.

magnitude of r' ~ 20 mag, but the sample is incomplete at r' > 17 mag. The
surface distribution of the Halpha emission stars reveals a clustered and a
dispersed population, the former consisting of younger and more massive young
stars than the latter. Comparison of the derived EWs with those found in the

interaction with active region (AR) loops observed by the Solar Dynamics
Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly and the Hinode EUV Imaging
Spectrometer (EIS). This wave was initiated from AR 11261 on 2011 August 4 and
propagated at velocities of 430--910 km\s. It was observed to traverse another
AR and cross over a filament channel on its path. The EUV wave perturbed
neighboring AR loops and excited a disturbance that propagated toward the
footpoints of these loops. EIS observations of AR loops revealed that at the
time of the wave transit, the original redshift increased by about 3 km\s,
while the original blueshift decreased slightly. After the wave transit, these
changes were reversed. When the EUV wave arrived at the boundary of a polar
coronal hole, two reflected waves were successively produced and part of them
propagated above the solar limb. The first reflected wave above the solar limb
encountered a large-scale loop system on its path, and a secondary wave rapidly
emerged 144 Mm ahead of it at a higher speed. These findings can be explained
in the framework of a fast-mode magnetosonic wave interpretation for EUV waves,
in which observed EUV waves are generated by expanding coronal mass ejections.

systems. The most popular method for nonequilibrium systems, forward flux
sampling (FFS), samples rare events by using interfaces to partition the whole
transition process into sequence of steps along an order parameter connecting
the initial and final states. FFS usually suffers from two main difficulties:
low computational efficiency due to bad interface locations and even being not
applicable when trapping into unknown intermediate metastable states. In the
present work, we propose an approach to overcome these difficulties, by
self-adaptively locating the interfaces on the fly in an optimized manner.
Contrary to the conventional FFS which set the interfaces with euqal distance
of the order parameter, our approach determines the interfaces with equal
transition probability which is shown to satisfy the optimization condition.
This is done by firstly running long local trajectories starting from the
current interface $\l_i$ to get the conditional probability distribution $P_c$,
and then determining $\l_{i+1}$ by equalling $P_c$ to a give value $p_0$. With
these optimized interfaces, FFS can be run in a much efficient way. In
addition, our approach can conveniently find the intermediate metastable states
by monitoring some special long trajectories that nither end at the initial
state nor reach the next interface, the number of which will increase sharply
from zero if such metastable states are encountered. We apply our approach to a
model two-state system and a two-dimensional lattice gas Ising model. Our
approach is shown to be much more efficient than the conventional FFS method
without losing accuracy, and it can also well reproduce the two-step nucleation
scenario of the Ising model with easy identification of the intermidiate
metastable state.

tilting relaxation time can be very large as it scales with the square of the
track width. The results are well explained by an analytical model based on a
Lagrangian approach where the DMI and the DW tilting are included. We propose a
simple way to estimate the DMI in a magnetic multilayers by measuring the
dependence of the DW tilt angle on a transverse static magnetic field. Our
results shed light on the current induced DW tilting observed recently in Co/Ni
multilayers with inversion asymmetry, and further support the presence of DMI

corrects the previous speculation that the spin gap collapses at x~13 by the

evolves into a Q-independent feature in x>11. This could be attributed to the
localized Cu moment magnetism developing into an itinerant magnetism with

second order by an explicit calculation for the scalar theory. Among several
variational strategies, the methods of minimal sensitivity and of minimal
variance are discussed in some detail. For the scalar theory, at variance with
other post-Gaussian approaches, the pole of the second-order propagator is
shown to satisfy the simple first-order gap equation that seems to be more
robust than expected. By the method of minimal variance, nontrivial results are
found for gauge theories containing fermions, where the first-order Gaussian
approximation is known to be useless.

evidence regarding how often Twitter is used to diffuse journal articles in the
biomedical and life sciences. The analysis is based on a set of 1.4 million
documents covered by both PubMed and Web of Science (WoS) and published between
2010 and 2012. The number of tweets containing links to these documents was
analyzed to evaluate the degree to which certain journals, disciplines, and
specialties were represented on Twitter. It is shown that, with less than 10%
of PubMed articles mentioned on Twitter, its uptake is low in general. The
relationship between tweets and WoS citations was examined for each document at
the level of journals and specialties. The results show that tweeting behavior
varies between journals and specialties and correlations between tweets and
citations are low, implying that impact metrics based on tweets are different
from those based on citations. A framework utilizing the coverage of articles
and the correlation between Twitter mentions and citations is proposed to
facilitate the evaluation of novel social-media based metrics and to shed light
on the question in how far the number of tweets is a valid metric to measure

simulation results and subjective tests using a range of video clips. It is
demonstrated that pause intensity is closely correlated with viewer opinion

We describe the cosmological background which is given by an exact solution of
the equations of motion in which the particles expand homothetically with their
comoving positions constituting a central configuration. We point out, using
previous work, that an important class of central configurations are
homogeneous and isotropic, thus justifying the usual assumptions of elementary
treatments. The scale factor is shown to satisfy the standard Raychaudhuri and
Friedmann equations without making any fluid dynamic or continuum
approximations. Since we make no commitment as to the identity of the point
particles, our results are valid for cold dark matter, galaxies, or clusters of
galaxies. In future publications we plan to discuss perturbations of our
cosmological background from the point particle viewpoint laid down in this
paper and show consistency with much standard theory usually obtained by more
complicated and conceptually less clear continuum methods. Apart from its
potential use in large scale structure studies, we believe that out approach
has great pedagogic advantages over existing elementary treatments of the

mechanics but concentrates on the basic physics: Newton's laws for
gravitationally interacting particles.

covering of the circle. The definition is first introduced in general for
homeomorphisms of $\mathbf{S}$ which are isotopic to a translation, and then
specializing in homeomorphisms of $\mathbf{S}$ isotopic to the identity, in
which case the rotation set is a closed interval contained in the base leaf
(the connected component of the identity). If in the latter case the rotation
interval reduces to a single element $\rho$ and $\rho$ is irrational (\ie it is
a monothetic generator of $\mathbf{S}$), we show that the homeomorphism is
semiconjugate to the translation $z\mapsto\rho{z}$, like in the classical
theory of Poincar\'e. This theory is valid for any general compact abelian one

dense subgroups $G$ of the rational numbers with the discrete topology. These
solenoidal groups are one-dimensional laminations which are locally
homeomorphic to the product of a Cantor set by an interval so they behave very
much like a ``diffuse'' version of the circle. Our approach differs from others
because we use Pontryagin duality of compact abelian groups to define the
rotation sets.

Intersimilarity means that a pair of interdependent nodes have neighbors in
both networks that are also interdependent (Parshani et al \cite{PAR10B}). For
example, the coupled world wide port network and the global airport network are
intersimilar since many pairs of linked nodes (neighboring cities), by direct
flights and direct shipping lines exist in both networks. Nodes in both
networks in the same city are regarded as interdependent. If two neighboring
nodes in one network depend on neighboring nodes in the another we call these
links common links. The fraction of common links in the system is a measure of
intersimilarity. Previous simulation results suggest that intersimilarity has
considerable effect on reducing the cascading failures, however, a theoretical
understanding on this effect on the cascading process is currently missing.
Here, we map the cascading process with inter-similarity to a percolation of
networks composed of components of common links and non common links. This
transforms the percolation of inter-similar system to a regular percolation on
a series of subnetworks, which can be solved analytically. We apply our
analysis to the case where the network of common links is an
Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) network with the average degree $K$, and the two
networks of non-common links are also ER networks. We show for a fully coupled
pair of ER networks, that for any $K\geq0$, although the cascade is reduced
with increasing $K$, the phase transition is still discontinuous. Our analysis
can be generalized to any kind of interdependent random networks system.

equations of motion and contains a non-minimally coupled abelian gauge vector
field. This theory is remarkably simple and consists of only 2 terms for the
vector field, namely: the standard Maxwell kinetic term and a coupling to the
dual Riemann tensor. Furthermore, the vector sector respects the U(1) gauge
symmetry and the theory contains only one free parameter, M^2, that controls
the strength of the non-minimal coupling. We explore the theory in a de Sitter
spacetime and study the presence of instabilities and show that it corresponds
to an attractor solution in the presence of the vector field. We also
investigate the cosmological evolution and stability of perturbations in a
general FLRW spacetime. We find that a sufficient condition for the absence of
ghosts is M^2>0. Moreover, we study further constraints coming from imposing
the absence of Laplacian instabilities. Finally, we study the stability of the
theory in static and spherically symmetric backgrounds (in particular,
Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\""om-de Sitter). We find that the theory,
quite generally, do have ghosts or Laplacian instabilities in regions of

Lundquist number $S_{H}\equiv L^{3}V_{A}/\eta_{H}$, where $L$ is the system
size, $V_{A}$ is the Alfv\'en velocity, and $\eta_{H}$ is the

independent of $S_{H}$, the number of plasmoids scales as $S_{H}^{1/2}$, and
the secondary current sheet length and width both scale as $S_{H}^{-1/2}$.

the collision of key gas species (key molecule) controls the kinetics of dust
formation process. The formula allows us to evaluate the size distribution and
condensation efficiency of dust formed in astrophysical environments. We apply
the formulation to the formation of C and MgSiO3 grains in the ejecta of
supernovae, as an example, to investigate how the non-steady effect influences
the formation process, condensation efficiency f_{con}, and average radius
a_{ave} of newly formed grains in comparison with the results calculated with
the steady-state nucleation rate. We show that the steady-state nucleation rate
is a good approximation if the collision timescale of key molecule tau_{coll}
is much smaller than the timescale tau_{sat} with which the supersaturation
ratio increases; otherwise the effect of the non-steady state becomes
remarkable, leading to a lower f_{con} and a larger a_{ave}. Examining the
results of calculations, we reveal that the steady-state nucleation rate is
applicable if the cooling gas satisfies Lambda = tau_{sat}/tau_{coll} > 30

determined by Lambda_{on} at the onset time t_{on} of dust formation. The

ring-like stain, while ellipsoids are deposited uniformly. Experiments
elucidate the kinetics of ellipsoids and spheres at the drop's edge. A second
set of experiments examined evaporating drops confined between glass plates. In
this case, colloidal particles coat the ribbon-like air-water interface,
forming colloidal monolayer membranes (CMMs). As particle anisotropy increases,
CMM bending rigidity was found to increase, which in turn introduces a new
mechanism that produces a uniform deposition of ellipsoids and a heterogeneous
deposition of spheres after drying. A final set of experiments investigates the
effect of surfactants in evaporating drops. The radially outward flow that
pushes particles to the drop's edge also pushes surfactants to the drop's edge,
which leads to a radially inward flow on the drop surface. The presence of
radially outward flows in the bulk fluid and radially inward flows at the drop

microscopic and stochastic model which describes a crucial step in protein
translation, namely the binding of the tRNA to the ribosome. Our model
explicitly takes into consideration tRNA recharging dynamics, spatial
inhomogeneity and stochastic fluctuations in the number of charged tRNAs around
the ribosome. By analyzing this non-equilibrium system we are able to derive
the statistical distribution of the times needed by the tRNAs to bind to the
ribosome, and to show that it deviates from an exponential due to the coupling
between the fluctuations of charged and uncharged populations of tRNA.

matrices for amplify-and-forward relay station and base station. Our objective
is to increase max-min SINR fairness within co-channel users in a cell. The
main achievement of this work is avoiding any tedious alternating optimization
for joint design of RS/BS precoders, in order to save complexity. Moreover, no
convex solver is required in this method. RS precoding is done by transforming
the underlying non-convex problem into a system of nonlinear equations which is
then solved using Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. This method for RS precoder
design is guaranteed to converge to a local optimum. For the BS precoder a
low-complexity iterative method is proposed. The efficiency of the joint
optimization method is verified by simulations.

however, have been observed in earthquake return intervals and in the fracture
strength of quasi-brittle materials. We investigate weakest-link scaling in
finite-size systems and deviations of empirical return interval distributions
from the Weibull distribution function. We use the ansatz that the survival
probability function of a system with complex interactions among its units can
be expressed as the product of the survival probability functions for an
ensemble of representative volume elements (RVEs). We show that if the system
comprises a finite number of RVEs, it obeys the $\kappa$-Weibull distribution.
We conduct statistical analysis of experimental data and simulations that show
good agreement with the $\kappa$-Weibull distribution. We show the following:
(1) The weakest-link theory for finite-size systems involves the
$\kappa$-Weibull distribution. (2) The power-law decline of the
$\kappa$-Weibull upper tail can explain deviations from the Weibull scaling
observed in return interval data. (3) The hazard rate function of the
$\kappa$-Weibull distribution decreases linearly after a waiting time $\tau_c
\propto n^{1/m}$, where $m$ is the Weibull modulus and $n$ is the system size
in terms of representative volume elements. (4) The $\kappa$-Weibull provides
competitive fits to the return interval distributions of seismic data and of
avalanches in a fiber bundle model. In conclusion, using theoretical and
statistical analysis of real and simulated data, we show that the
$\kappa$-Weibull distribution is a useful model for extreme-event return

distribution of the fixed parameters of a state-space dynamical system using a

structure that employs two layers of particle filters to approximate the
posterior probability measure of the static parameters and the dynamic state
variables of the system of interest, in a vein similar to the recent
""sequential Monte Carlo square"" (SMC$^2$) algorithm. However, unlike the
SMC$^2$ scheme, the proposed technique operates in a purely recursive manner.
In particular, the computational complexity of the recursive steps of the
method introduced herein is constant over time. We analyse the approximation of
integrals of real bounded functions with respect to the posterior distribution
of the system parameters computed via the proposed scheme. As a result, we
prove, under regularity assumptions, that the approximation errors vanish
asymptotically in $L_p$ ($p \ge 1$) with convergence rate proportional to
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{M}}$, where $N$ is the number of Monte
Carlo samples in the parameter space and $N\times M$ is the number of samples
in the state space. This result also holds for the approximation of the joint
posterior distribution of the parameters and the state variables. We discuss
the relationship between the SMC$^2$ algorithm and the new recursive method and
present a simple example in order to illustrate some of the theoretical
findings with computer simulations.

younger objects have similar or slightly higher oxygen abundances compared with
the older objects, and the gradients of both groups are similar within the

during the lifetime of the objects considered, so that PN gradients are not
expected to be very different from the gradients observed in younger objects,
which seems to be supported by recent observational data.

part of the GALEX Arecibo SDSS Survey (GASS). We fit six different models to
the HISMF and find that a Schechter function that extends down to a 1% HI gas
fraction, with an additional fractional contribution below that limit, is the
best parametrization of the HISMF. We calculate Omega_{HI, M_* >10^10} and find
that massive galaxies contribute 41% of the HI density in the local universe.
In addition to the binned HISMF we derive a continuous bivariate fit, which
reveals that the Schechter parameters only vary weakly with stellar mass:
M_HI^*, the characteristic HI mass, scales as M_*^0.39, alpha, the slope of the
HISMF at moderate HI masses, scales as M_*^0.07, and f, the fraction of
galaxies with HI gas fraction greater than 1%, scales as M_*^-0.24. The
variation of f with stellar mass should be a strong constraint for numerical
simulations. To understand the physical mechanisms that produce the shape of
the HISMF we redefine the parameters of the Schechter function as explicit
functions of stellar mass and star formation rate to produce a trivariate fit.
This analysis reveals strong trends with SFR. While M_HI^* varies weakly with
stellar mass and SFR, alpha is a stronger function of both stellar mass and
especially star formation rate. The HISMF is a crucial tool that can be used to
constrain cosmological galaxy simulations, test observational predictions of
the HI content of populations of galaxies, and identify galaxies whose
properties deviate from average trends.

the global average. This width is much smaller than the full range of albedos
(from ~0.55x to >2x global average) in localized bright and dark areas of a few
tens of km in sizes, and is probably a consequence of significant regolith
mixing on the global scale. Rheasilvia basin is about 10% brighter than the
global average. The phase reddening of Vesta measured from Dawn Framing Camera
images is comparable or slightly stronger than that of Eros as measured by the

small-worldness, for identifying topological phase transitions of quantum and
classical spin models. Small-worldness is usually defined in the study of
social networks based on the best known discovery that one can find a short
chain of acquaintances connecting almost any two people on the planet. Here we
demonstrate that the small-world effect provides a useful description to
distinguish topologically trivial and non-trivial phases in the Kitaev chain
and accurately capture the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in the rotor plane.
Our results further suggest that the small-worldness containing both locality

characteristic quantities of topological states of matter.

models, are called ""topological"" and represent spatial data by a structured
collection of ""topological primitives"" like edges, vertices, faces, and
volumes. These then represent spatial objects in geo-information- (GIS) or CAD
systems or in building information models (BIM). Volume objects may then either
be represented by their 2D boundary or by a dedicated 3D-element, the ""solid"".
The latter may share common boundary elements with other solids, just as
2D-polygon topologies in GIS share common boundary edges. Despite the frequent
reference to ""topology"" in publications on spatial modelling the formal link
between mathematical topology and these ""topological"" models is hardly
described in the literature. Such link, for example, cannot be established by
the often cited nine-intersections model which is too elementary for that
purpose. Mathematically, the link between spatial data and the modelled ""real
world"" entities is established by a chain of ""continuous functions"" - a very
important topological notion, yet often overlooked by spatial data modellers.
This article investigates how spatial data can actually be considered
topological spaces, how continuous functions between them are defined, and how
CAD systems can make use of them. Having found examples of applications of
continuity in CAD data models it turns out that of continuity has much
practical relevance for CAD systems.

self-consistent fashion for a simplified pure hydrogen case. It is shown that
changes in the ionizing radiation yield ionization/thermal fronts that
propagate through the cloud, but the propagation times and response times to
such fronts vary widely and non-linearly from the illuminated face of the cloud
to the ionization front (IF). Ionization/thermal fronts are often supersonic,
and in slabs initially in pressure equilibrium such fronts yield large pressure
imbalances that are likely to produce important dynamical effects in the cloud.
  Further, we studied the case of periodic variations in the ionizing flux. It
is found that the physical conditions of the plasma have complex behaviors that
differ from any steady-state solutions. Moreover, even the time average
ionization and temperature is different from any steady-state case. This time
average is characterized by over-ionization and a broader IF with respect to
the steady-state solution for a mean value of the radiation flux. Around the
time average of physical conditions there is large dispersion in instantaneous
conditions, particularly across the IF, which increases with the period of
radiation flux variations. Moreover, the variations in physical conditions are
asynchronous along the slab due to the combination of non-linear propagation
times for thermal/ionization fronts and equilibration times.

the way to future applications in cosmology. The role of the BTZ black hole is
also briefly addressed. The singular boundary of the pseudospheres, ""Hilbert
horizon"", is seen to be closely related to event horizon of the Rindler, de

phenomenon to take place. An important geometric parameter, $c$, overlooked in
earlier work, takes here its place for physical applications, and it is shown
to be related to graphene's lattice spacing, $\ell$. It is shown that all
surfaces of constant negative curvature, ${\cal K} = -r^{-2}$, are unified, in
the limit $c/r \to 0$, where they are locally applicable to the Beltrami
pseudosphere. This, and $c = \ell$, allow us a) to have a phenomenological
control on the reaching of the horizon; b) to use spacetimes different than
Rindler for the Hawking phenomenon; c) to approach the generic surface of the
family. An improved expression for the thermal LDOS is obtained. A non-thermal
term for the total LDOS is found. It takes into account: a) the peculiarities
of the graphene-based Rindler spacetime; b) the finiteness of a laboratory

distinct assumptions. For any of these inequalities, satisfaction is equivalent
to a joint probability distribution for all observables in the experiment. This
implies a joint distribution for all pairs of observables, and is indifferent
to whether or not they commute in the theory. This indifference underpins a
unification of the above inequalities into a general framework of correlation
inequalities. When the physical scenario is such that the correlated pairs are
all compatible, the resulting correlation is non-signaling, which may be local
or multi-particle, corresponding to contextuality or Bell-type inequalities. If
the pairs are incompatible, the resulting correlation corresponds to
Leggett-Garg (LG) inequalities. That quantum mechanics (QM) violates all these

i.e., design a consistent sparse representation of the same face in different
domains. In this way, classifiers trained on the sparse codes in the source
domain consisting of frontal faces for example can be applied to the target
domain (consisting of faces in different poses, illumination conditions, etc)
without much loss in recognition accuracy. The approach is to first learn a
domain base dictionary, and then describe each domain shift (identity, pose,
illumination) using a sparse representation over the base dictionary. The
dictionary adapted to each domain is expressed as sparse linear combinations of
the base dictionary. In the context of face recognition, with the proposed
compositional dictionary approach, a face image can be decomposed into sparse
representations for a given subject, pose and illumination respectively. This
approach has three advantages: first, the extracted sparse representation for a
subject is consistent across domains and enables pose and illumination
insensitive face recognition. Second, sparse representations for pose and
illumination can subsequently be used to estimate the pose and illumination
condition of a face image. Finally, by composing sparse representations for
subject and the different domains, we can also perform pose alignment and
illumination normalization. Extensive experiments using two public face
datasets are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for

clustering. Many high-dimensional data, such as face images and motion
sequences, lie in a union of low-dimensional subspaces. The subspace clustering
problem has been extensively studied in the literature to partition such
high-dimensional data into clusters corresponding to their underlying
low-dimensional subspaces. However, low-dimensional intrinsic structures are
often violated for real-world observations, as they can be corrupted by errors
or deviate from ideal models. We propose to address this by learning a linear
transformation on subspaces using matrix rank, via its convex surrogate nuclear
norm, as the optimization criteria. The learned linear transformation restores
a low-rank structure for data from the same subspace, and, at the same time,
forces a high-rank structure for data from different subspaces. In this way, we
reduce variations within the subspaces, and increase separations between the
subspaces for more accurate subspace clustering. This proposed learned robust
subspace clustering framework significantly enhances the performance of
existing subspace clustering methods. To exploit the low-rank structures of the
transformed subspaces, we further introduce a subspace clustering technique,
called Robust Sparse Subspace Clustering, which efficiently combines robust PCA
with sparse modeling. We also discuss the online learning of the

reducing the data dimensionality. Extensive experiments using public datasets

-dimensional spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universes with a
power-law scale factor, assuming that the field is prepared in the Bunch-Davies
vacuum state. The range of powers are specified in which the two-point
functions are infrared convergent and the Bunch-Davies vacuum for the
electromagnetic field is a physically realizable state. The two-point functions
are applied for the investigation of the vacuum expectation values of the field
squared and the energy-momentum tensor, induced by a single and two parallel
conducting plates. Unlike to the case of conducting plates in the Minkowski
bulk, in the problem under consideration the stresses along the directions
parallel to the plates are not equal to the energy density. We show that, in
addition to the diagonal components, the vacuum energy-momentum tensor has a
nonzero off-diagonal component which describes energy flux along the direction
normal to the plates. For a single plate this flux is directed from the plate.
The Casimir forces are investigated in the geometry of two plates. At
separations between the plates smaller than the curvature radius of the
background spacetime, to the leading order, we recover the corresponding result
in the Minkowski spacetime and in this case the forces are attractive. At
larger separations, the influence of the curvature on the Casimir forces is
essential with different asymptotic behavior for decelerated and accelerated
expansions. In particular, for the latter case there is a range of powers of
the expansion law in which the forces become repulsive at large separations
between the plates.

subdividing an asexual population on the time it takes to cross a fitness
valley or plateau. We focus on a generic and minimal model that includes only
population subdivision into equivalent demes connected by global migration, and
does not require significant size changes of the demes, environmental
heterogeneity or specific geographic structure. We determine the optimal
speedup of valley or plateau crossing that can be gained by subdivision, if the
process is driven by the deme that crosses fastest. We show that isolated demes
have to be in the sequential fixation regime for subdivision to significantly
accelerate crossing. Using Markov chain theory, we obtain analytical
expressions for the conditions under which optimal speedup is achieved: valley
or plateau crossing by the subdivided population is then as fast as that of its
fastest deme. We verify our analytical predictions through stochastic
simulations. We demonstrate that subdivision can substantially accelerate the
crossing of fitness valleys and plateaus in a wide range of parameters
extending beyond the optimal window. We study the effect of varying the degree
of subdivision of a population, and investigate the trade-off between the
magnitude of the optimal speedup and the width of the parameter range over
which it occurs. Our results also hold for weakly beneficial intermediate
mutations. We extend our work to the case of a population connected by
migration to one or several smaller islands. Our results demonstrate that
subdivision with migration alone can significantly accelerate the crossing of

jet-producing epochs (X-ray class $\alpha$ and $\beta$). While previous studies
have linked the large-amplitude IR flares and X-ray behaviors to jet formation
in these states, our new analyses are sensitive to much lower-amplitude IR
variability, providing more sensitive probes of the jet formation process. The
X-ray to IR cross-correlation function (CCF) shows significant correlations
which vary in form between the different X-ray states. During low/hard dips in
both classes, we find no significant X-ray/IR correlation. During
high-variability epochs, we find consistently significant correlations in both
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ classes, but with strong differences in the CCF structure.
The high-variability $\alpha$ CCF shows strong anti-correlation between
X-ray/IR, with the X-ray preceding the IR by $\sim$ 13 $\pm$ 2s. The
high-variability $\beta$ state shows time-variable CCF structure, which is
statistically significant but without a clearly consistent lag. Our simulated
IR light curves, designed to match the observed CCFs, show variably-flickering
IR emission during the class $\beta$ high-variability epoch, while the class
$\alpha$ can be fit by IR flickering with frequencies in the range 0.1 to 0.3
Hz, strengthening $\sim$10 s after every X-ray subflare. We interpret these
features in the context of the X-ray-emitting accretion disk and IR emission
from relativistic jet formation in GRS 1915+105, concluding that the CCF
analysis places the origin in a synchrotron-emitting relativistic compact jet
at a distance from the compact object of $\sim$0.02AU.

large coronal loops in EUV images over a decade, and are widely accepted to be
slow magnetosonic waves. However, spectroscopic observations from Hinode/EIS
revealed their association with persistent coronal upflows, making this
interpretation debatable. Motivated by the scenario that the coronal upflows
could be cumulative result of numerous individual flow pulses generated by
sporadic heating events (nanoflares) at the loop base, we construct a velocity
driver with repetitive tiny pulses, whose energy frequency distribution follows
the flare power-law scaling. We then perform 3D MHD modeling of an idealized
bipolar active region by applying this broadband velocity driver at the
footpoints of large coronal loops which appear open in the computational
domain. Our model successfully reproduces the PDs with similar features as the
observed, and shows that any upflow pulses inevitably excite slow magnetosonic
wave disturbances propagating along the loop. We find that the generated PDs
are dominated by the wave signature as their propagation speeds are consistent
with the wave speed in the presence of flows, and the injected flows rapidly
decelerate with height. Our simulation results suggest that the observed PDs
and associated persistent upflows may be produced by small-scale impulsive
heating events (nanoflares) at the loop base, and that the flows and waves may
both contribute to the PDs at lower heights.

the covariance between lensing power spectrum and trispectrum analyses. We find
two dominant contributions coming from: (i) correlations between the
disconnected noise bias in the trispectrum measurement and sample variance in
the temperature power spectrum; and (ii) sample variance of the lenses
themselves. The former is naturally removed when the dominant N0 Gaussian bias
in the reconstructed deflection spectrum is dealt with via a partially
data-dependent correction, as advocated elsewhere for other reasons. The
remaining lens-cosmic-variance contribution is easily modeled but can safely be
ignored for a Planck-like experiment, justifying treating the two observable
spectra as independent. We also test simple likelihood approximations for the
deflection power spectrum, finding that a Gaussian with a parameter-independent
covariance performs well.

geometrical entropy of classical ER bridges satisfies the subadditivity,
triangle, strong subadditivity, and CLW inequalities. These are nontrivial
properties of entanglement entropy, so this is evidence for ER=EPR. We further
show that the entanglement entropy associated to classical ER bridges has
nonpositive interaction information. This is not a property of entanglement
entropy, in general. For example, the entangled four qubit pure state
|GHZ_4>=(|0000>+|1111>)/\sqrt{2} has positive interaction information, so this
state cannot be described by a classical ER bridge. Large black holes with
massive amounts of entanglement between them can fail to have a classical ER

properties of the $\sim 126$ GeV Higgs boson lead to important inter-dependent
constraints on the underlying parameter space of the MSSM. The 19/20-parameter
p(henomenological)MSSM offers a flexible framework for the study of a wide
variety of both Higgs and SUSY phenomena at the LHC and elsewhere. Within this
scenario we address the following questions: `What will potentially null
searches for SUSY at the LHC tell us about the possible properties of the Higgs
boson?' and, conversely, `What do precision measurements of the properties of
the Higgs tell us about the possible properties of the various superpartners?'
Clearly the answers to such questions will be functions of both the collision
energy of the LHC as well as the accumulated integrated luminosity. We address
these questions employing several sets of pMSSM models having either neutralino
or gravitino LSPs, making use of the ATLAS SUSY analyses at the 7/8 TeV LHC as
well as planned SUSY and Higgs analyses at the 14 TeV LHC and the ILC. Except
for theoretical uncertainties that remain to be accounted for in the ratios of
SUSY and SM couplings, we demonstrate that Higgs coupling measurements at the
14 TeV LHC, and particularly at the 500 GeV ILC, will be sensitive to regions
of the pMSSM model space that are not accessible to direct SUSY searches.

oriented rotational frequency vector $\boldsymbol{\omega}$ in the intrinsic
frame, one has to employ constraints on average values of the quadrupole-moment
tensor, so as to keep the nucleus in the principal-axis reference frame. Kerman
and Onishi [Nucl. Phys. A {\bf 361}, 179 (1981)] have shown that the Lagrangian
multipliers that correspond to the required constraints are proportional to
$\boldsymbol{\omega} \times \boldsymbol{J}$, where $\boldsymbol{J}$ is the
average angular momentum vector.
  \item[Purpose] We study the validity and consequences of the Kerman-Onishi
conditions in the context of self-consistent tilted-axis-cranking (TAC)
mean-field calculations.
  \item[Methods] We perform a two-dimensional self-consistent calculations
(with and without pairing) utilizing the symmetry-unrestricted solver {\sc
hfodd}. At each tilting angle, we compare the calculated values of
quadrupole-moment-tensor Lagrangian multipliers and $\boldsymbol{\omega} \times
\boldsymbol{J}$.
  \item[Results] We show that in self-consistent calculations, the
Kerman-Onishi conditions are obeyed with high precision. Small deviations seen
in the calculations with pairing can be attributed to the truncation of the
quasiparticle spectrum. We also provide results of systematic TAC calculations
for triaxial strongly deformed bands in $^{160}$Yb.
  \item[Conclusions] For non-stationary TAC solutions, Kerman-Onishi conditions
link the non-zero values of the angle between rotational-frequency and
angular-momentum vectors to the constraints on off-diagonal components of the
quadrupole-moment tensor. To stabilize the convergence of self-consistent
iterations, such constraints have to be taken into account. Only then one can
determine the Routhian surfaces as functions of the tilting angles.

this question and show that whenever the cosmic censorship conjecture is
threaten, an instability generically shows up driving the system to a new
configuration with presumably no naked singularities. Also, the same kind of
instability shows up in the process of spherical black holes evaporation in
these theories, suggesting a new phase for their decay. We find circumstantial

immediately above its temperature minimum. Mechanisms such as resistive
dissipation and shock waves appear insufficient to account for the persistence
and uniformity of this heating as inferred from both UV lines and continuum
measurements. This paper further develops the theory of the Farley-Buneman
Instability (FBI) which could contribute substantially to this heating. It
expands upon the single ion theory presented by Fontenla (2005) by developing a
multiple ion species approach that better models the diverse, metal-dominated
ion plasma of the solar chromosphere. This analysis generates a linear
dispersion relationship that predicts the critical electron drift velocity
needed to trigger the instability. Using careful estimates of collision
frequencies and a one-dimensional, semi-empirical model of the chromosphere,
this new theory predicts that the instability may be triggered by velocities as
low as 4 km s^-1, well below the neutral acoustic speed. In the Earth's
ionosphere, the FBI occurs frequently in situations where the instability
trigger speed significantly exceeds the neutral acoustic speed. From this, we
expect neutral flows rising from the photosphere to have enough energy to
easily create electric fields and electron Hall drifts with sufficient
amplitude to make the FBI common in the chromosphere. If so, this process will
provide a mechanism to convert neutral flow and turbulence energy into electron
thermal energy in the quiet Sun.

viewed in their restframe UV) than for Kiso galaxies (viewed at g-band), and
major axis intensity scans are even more irregular for the UDF than Kiso

de Finetti theorems provide such a structure for the case where certain

permutations of subsystems to states in which the subsystems are independent of
each other. This relation plays an important role in various areas, e.g., in
quantum cryptography or state tomography, where permutation invariant systems

smaller but higher resolution run is able to match the observational data of
the low bolometric luminosity end at higher redshifts $z=3-4$. We also perform
a direct comparison with the observed soft and hard X-ray luminosity functions
of AGN, including an empirical correction for a torus-level obscuration, and
find a similarly good agreement. These results nicely demonstrate that the
observed ""anti-hierarchical"" trend in the AGN number density evolution (i.e.
the number densities of luminous AGN peak at higher redshifts than those of

collision calculations to estimate what mass WDs should be exploding in each

compared with the observed Galactic WD mass distribution and Monte Carlo
simulations of WD-WD binary populations. For collisions, we find that the
average mass of the individual components of the WD-WD binary must be peaked at
~0.75Msun, significantly higher than the average WD mass in binaries or in the
field of ~0.55-0.60Msun. Thus, if collisions produce a large fraction of SNe
Ia, then a mechanism must exist that favors large mass WDs. On the other hand,
in an old stellar population, collisions would naturally result in a class of
low luminosity SNe Ia, and we suggest these may be related to 1991bg-like
events. For sub-Chandrasekhar detonations, we find that the average mass of the
exploding WDs must be peaked at ~1.1Msun. This is interestingly similar to the
average sum of the masses in WD-WD binaries, but it is not clear (and should be
further explored) whether double degenerate mergers would be sufficiently
efficient at synthesizing 56Ni to match the observed yields. If not, then
actual ~1.1Msun WDs would be needed for sub-Chandrasekhar detonations. Since
such high mass WDs are produced relatively quickly in comparison to the age of
the environments where SNe Ia are found, this would require either accretion
onto lower mass WDs prior to ignition or a long timescale between formation of
the ~1.1Msun WD and ignition (such as set by gravitational wave emission or

condensed-matter point of view. In order to better interpret the
strong-coupling results from holography, an understanding of the weak-coupling

step in this direction by studying several simple supersymmetric and

supersymmetric examples are $\mathcal{N}=1$ super-QED and $\mathcal{N}=2$
super-QED, with finite densities of electron number and R-charge respectively.
Despite the fact that fermionic fields couple to the chemical potentials we
introduce, the structure of the interaction terms is such that in both of the
supersymmetric cases the fermions do not develop a Fermi surface. One might
suspect that all of the charge in such theories would be stored in the scalar
condensates, but we show that this is not necessarily the case by giving an
example of a theory without a Fermi surface where the fermions still manage to
contribute to the charge density.

brightness profiles, we calculated the K-band mass-to-light ratio of the
stellar disks (M/L). Our result is consistent with all galaxies in the sample
having equal M/L, with a sample average and scatter of <M/L>=0.31+/-0.07.
Rotation-curves of the baryonic components were calculated from their mass
surface densities, and used with circular-speed measurements to derive the
structural parameters of the DM halos, modeled as either a pseudo-isothermal
sphere (pISO) or an NFW halo. All galaxies in our sample are submaximal, such
that at 2.2 disk scale lengths (hR) the ratios between the baryonic and total
rotation-curves (Fb^{2.2hR}) are less than 0.75. We find this ratio to be
nearly constant between 1-6 hR within individual galaxies. We find a sample
average and scatter of <Fb^{2.2hR}>=0.57+/-0.07, with trends of larger
Fb^{2.2hR} for more luminous and higher-surface-brightness galaxies. To enforce
these being maximal, we need to scale M/L by a factor 3.6 on average. The DM
rotation curves are marginally better fit by a pISO than by an NFW halo. For
the nominal-M/L (submaximal) case, the derived NFW-halo parameters have values
consistent with LCDM N-body simulations, suggesting that the baryonic matter
has only had a minor effect on the DM distribution. In contrast, maximum-M/L
decompositions yield halo concentrations that are too low compared to the LCDM
simulations.

cloud properties agree well with the observed cloud properties, with the
closest agreement occurring between the clouds at comparable resolution in M33.
Our clouds are highly filamentary - a property that derives both from their
formation due to gravitational instability in the sheared galactic environment,
as well as to cloud- cloud gravitational encounters. We also find that the rate
at which potentially star forming gas accumulates within dense regions -
wherein n_{thresh} > 10^4 cm^{-3} - is 3% per 10 Myr, in clouds of roughly 10^6
Msun. This suggests that star formation rates in observed clouds are related to
the rates at which gas can be accumulated into dense subregions within GMCs via
filamentary flows. The most internally well-resolved clouds are chosen for
listing in a catalogue of simulated GMCs; the first of its kind. The catalogued

redshift distribution of nearby Fermi active galactic nuclei (AGN), and the
construction of a log(N)-log(S) relation. Based upon these, it has been argued
that the evolution of the gamma-ray bright blazar population must be much less
dramatic than that of other AGN. However, critical to such claims is the
assumption that inverse Compton cascades reprocess emission above a TeV into
the Fermi energy range, substantially enhancing the strength of the observed
limits. Here we demonstrate that in the absence of such a process, due, e.g.,
to the presence of virulent plasma beam instabilities that preempt the cascade,
a population of TeV-bright blazars that evolve similarly to quasars is
consistent with the population of hard gamma-ray blazars observed by Fermi.
Specifically, we show that a simple model for the properties and luminosity
function is simultaneously able to reproduce their log(N)-log(S) relation,
local redshift distribution, and contribution to the EGRB and its anisotropy
without any free parameters. Insofar the naturalness of a picture in which the
hard gamma-ray blazar population exhibits the strong redshift evolution
observed in other tracers of the cosmological history of accretion onto halos
is desirable, this lends support for the absence of the inverse Compton
cascades and the existence of the beam plasma instabilities.

Interactions significantly complicate this picture and can lead to entirely new

to be stabilized by interactions within nearly dispersionless bands with

the basics of tight-binding models hosting nearly flat bands with non-trivial

microscopic models, highlighting the analogy with continuum Landau level

optimally assign each agent a linear trajectory, motivated by the

outperform linear ones. With this motivation, we formulate a parametric
optimization problem in which we seek to determine such trajectories. We show
that the problem can be solved using Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis (IPA)
to obtain performance gradients on line and obtain a complete and scalable
solution. Since the solutions obtained are generally locally optimal, we
incorporate a stochastic comparison algorithm for deriving globally optimal
elliptical trajectories. Numerical examples are included to illustrate the main
result, allow for uncertainties modeled as stochastic processes, and compare

description of a strong correlation between the light-curve period and
color/spectral type for close and contact eclipsing binary stars. These large

this, we present a first principles, density functional theory study using the
hybrid HSE06 exchange-correlation functional of GaSb doped with 1.6$\%$
nitrogen. To study dilute-nitrides with small band gaps, the local density
approximation (LDA) is insufficient and more accurate techniques such as HSE06
are needed. We conduct a comparative study on GaAs:N, also with 1.6$\%$
nitrogen mole fraction, and find that GaSb:N has a smaller band gap and
displays more band gap bowing than GaAs:N. In addition we examine the orbital
character of the bands, finding the lowest conduction band to be
quasi-delocalized, with a large N-$3s$ contribution. At high concentrations,
the N atoms interact via the host matrix, forming a dispersive band of their
own which governs optoelectronic properties and dominates band gap bowing.
While this band drives the optical and electronic properties of GaSb:N, its
physics is not captured by traditional models for dilute-nitrides. We thus
propose that a complete theory of dilute-nitrides should incorporate orbital
character examination, especially at high N concentrations.

has to be accounted for in radiotherapy dose calculations. In Monte Carlo (MC)
calculations, the BSR can be modeled explicitly, but only when treatment head
geometry is available. In this study, monitor backscatter factors (MBSFs),
defined as the ratio of the charge collected in the monitor chamber for a
reference field to that of a given field, have been evaluated experimentally
and incorporated into MC modelling of linacs with either known or unknown
treatment head geometry.
  Materials and methods: A telescopic technique similar to that by Kubo (1989)
was used. However, instead of lead slits, a 1.8 mm diameter collimator and a
small (2 mm diameter) detector positioned at extended SDD were used. This setup
provided a field of view to the source of less than 3.1 mm and allowed for MBSF
measurements of open fields from 1 x 1 to 40 x 40 cm2. MBSFs were also
explicitly modeled in MC calculations using BEAMnrc and DOSXYZnrc codes for 6MV
and 18MV beams of a Varian 21EX linac. A method for deriving the Dchforward
values that are used in MC absolute dose calculations was demonstrated. These
values were derived from measured MBSFs for two 21EX and four TrueBeam
energies.
  Results: MBSFs were measured for 6MV and 18MV beams from Varian 21EX, and for
6MV, 10MV-FFF, 10MV, and 15MV beams from Varian TrueBeam linacs. For the open
field sizes modeled in this study for the 21EX, the measured MBSFs agreed with
MC calculated values within combined statistical (0.4%) and experimental (0.2%)
uncertainties. Variation of MBSFs across field sizes was about a factor of two
smaller for the TrueBeam compared to 21EX Varian linacs.
  Conclusions: Measured MBSFs and the derived Dchforward factors allow for the
incorporation of the BSR effect into accurate radiotherapy dose calculations
without explicit backscatter modelling.

applications in the screen space. In both steps, we devise an iterative

have been limited due to intra-channel dispersive smearing. To optimise

Galactic latitude, with 1500-s, 180-s and 90-s integrations for latitude ranges
$|b|<3.5^{\circ}$, $|b|<15^{\circ}$ and $|b|>15^{\circ}$, respectively. The
survey has so far resulted in the discovery of 15 radio pulsars, including a
pulsar with a characteristic age of $\sim18$ kyr, {PSR J2004+3429}, and a
highly eccentric, binary millisecond pulsar, {PSR J1946+3417}. All newly

effect on protein sequence. These polymorphisms are expected to be removed or
kept at low frequency by the action of natural selection, and rare deleterious
variants have been implicated as a possible explanation for the ""missing
heritability"" seen in many studies of complex traits. Nonetheless, the effect
of positive selection on linked sites or drift in small or inbred populations
may also impact the evolution of deleterious alleles. Here, we made use of
genome-wide genotyping data to characterize deleterious variants in a large
panel of maize inbred lines. We show that, in spite of small effective
population sizes and inbreeding, most putatively deleterious SNPs are indeed at
low frequencies within individual genetic groups. We find that genes showing
associations with a number of complex traits are enriched for deleterious
variants. Together these data are consistent with the dominance model of
heterosis, in which complementation of numerous low frequency, weak deleterious

promise to transform our understanding of the cosmic reionization. To unravel
the underlying physical process, we investigate the 21 cm structures of three
different ionizing sources, Population (Pop) III stars, the first galaxies, and
the first quasars, by using radiative transfer simulations that include both
ionization of neutral hydrogen and resonant scattering of Lya photons. We find
that Pop III stars and quasars produce a smooth transition from an ionized and
hot state to a neutral and cold one, owing to their hard spectral energy
distribution with abundant ionizing photons, in contrast to the sharp
transition in galaxies. Furthermore, Lya scattering plays a dominant role in
producing the 21 cm signal as it determines the relation between hydrogen spin
temperature and gas kinetic temperature. This effect, also called
Wouthuysen-Field coupling, depends strongly on the ionizing source. It is the
strongest around galaxies, where the spin temperature is highly coupled to that
of the gas, resulting in extended absorption troughs in the 21 cm brightness
temperature. On the other hand, in the case of Pop III stars, the 21 cm signal
shows both emission and absorption regions around a small HII bubble. For
quasars, a large emission region in the 21 cm signal is produced, and the
absorption region decreases as the size of the HII bubble becomes large due to
the limited traveling time of photons. We predict that future surveys from
large radio arrays such as MWA, LOFAR and SKA may be able to detect the 21 cm
signals of primordial galaxies and quasars, but not likely Pop III stars due to
its small angular diameter.

Scattering in optical waveguides that consist of a guiding core embedded in a
solid substrate. We find that SBS can arise due to coupling to acoustic modes
in three different regimes. First, the acoustic modes may be guided by total
internal reflection; in this case the SBS gain depends directly on the degree
of confinement of the acoustic mode in the core, which is in turn determined by
the acoustic V-parameter. Second, the acoustic modes may be leaky, but may
nevertheless have a sufficiently long lifetime to have a large effect on the
SBS gain; the lifetime of acoustic modes in this regime depends not only on the
contrast in acoustic properties between the core and the cladding, but is also
highly dependent on the waveguide dimensions. Finally SBS may occur due to
coupling to free modes, which exist even in the absence of acoustic
confinement; we find that the cumulative effect of coupling to these
non-confined modes results in significant SBS gain. We show how the different
acoustic properties of core and cladding lead to these different regimes, and
discuss the feasibility of SBS experiments using different material systems.

the species of fermions are required to describe the relevant spin operators to
describe the fermion spectra. A crucial difference from the $D=10, N=1$ theory
is that the fermions states are Dirac particles instead of Majorana-Weyl. Even
though the full spectrum of the theory contains both bosons and fermions of
various spin, there is no space-time supersymmetry due to obvious lack of
triality. The four coordinates of the 4 dimensional Euclidean space describes a
$CP^2$ to define the confined gauge symmetry $SU(3)_C$. The bosonization of
their supersymmetric partners yields additional two coordinates to describe a
$S^2$ that defines the $SU(2)_L$ of the Standard Model. There should be three

Spinors and gauge bosons derive their masses through coupling to the tachyons

chirality. According to a group theory analysis [M. Trif \textit{et al.}, Phys.
Rev. Lett. \textbf{101}, 217201 (2008)] an external electric field can
efficiently couple these two chiral spin states, even when the spin-orbit
interaction (SOI) is absent. The strength of this coupling, $d$, is determined
by an off-diagonal matrix element of the dipole operator, which can be
calculated by \textit{ab-initio} methods [M. F. Islam \textit{et al.}, Phys.

Coulomb-blockade transport experiments in the cotunneling regime can provide a
direct way to determine the spin-electric coupling strength. Indeed, an
electric field generates a $d$-dependent splitting of the ground state
manifold, which can be detected in the inelastic cotunneling conductance. Our
theoretical analysis is supported by master-equation calculations of quantum
transport in the cotunneling regime. We employ a Hubbard-model approach to
elucidate the relationship between the Hubbard parameters $t$ and $U$, and the
spin-electric coupling constant $d$. This allows us to predict the regime in
which the coupling constant $d$ can be extracted from experiment.

a spectrum covering optical through near-Infrared (NIR) light of the luminous
Type IIn supernova (SN IIn) 2010jl around one and half years after the
explosion. This unique data set reveals multiple signatures of newly formed
dust particles. The NIR portion of the spectrum provides a rare example where
thermal emission from newly formed hot dust grains is clearly detected. We
determine the main population of the dust species to be carbon grains at a
temperature of ~1,350 - 1,450K at this epoch. The mass of the dust grains is
derived to be ~(7.5 - 8.5) x 10^{-4} Msun. Hydrogen emission lines show
wavelength-dependent absorption, which provides a good estimate on the typical
size of the newly formed dust grains (~0.1 micron, and most likely <~0.01
micron). We attribute the dust grains to have been formed in a dense cooling
shell as a result of a strong SN-circumstellar media (CSM) interaction. The
dust grains occupy ~10% of the emitting volume, suggesting an inhomogeneous,
clumpy structure. The average CSM density is required to be >~3 x 10^{7}
cm^{-3}, corresponding to a mass loss rate of >~0.02 Msun yr^{-1} (for a mass
loss wind velocity of ~100 km s^{-1}). This strongly supports a scenario that
SN 2010jl and probably other luminous SNe IIn are powered by strong
interactions within very dense CSM, perhaps created by Luminous Blue Variable
(LBV)-like eruptions within the last century before the explosion.

solutions for localized modes (""solitons""). The PT-symmetric element is
represented by a point-like (delta-functional) gain-loss dipole
{\delta}^{\prime}(x), combined with the usual attractive potential {\delta}(x).
The nonlinearity is represented by self-focusing (SF) or self-defocusing (SDF)
Kerr terms, both spatially uniform and localized ones. The system can be
implemented in planar optical waveguides. For the sake of comparison, also
introduced is a model with separated {\delta}-functional gain and loss,
embedded into the linear medium and combined with the {\delta}-localized Kerr
nonlinearity and attractive potential. Full analytical solutions for pinned
modes are found in both models. The exact solutions are compared with numerical
counterparts, which are obtained in the gain-loss-dipole model with the
{\delta}^{\prime}- and {\delta}- functions replaced by their Lorentzian
regularization. With the increase of the dipole's strength, {\gamma}, the
single-peak shape of the numerically found mode, supported by the uniform SF
nonlinearity, transforms into a double-peak one. This transition coincides with
the onset of the escape instability of the pinned soliton. In the case of the

be analyzed in a controlled fashion by means of the \epsilon-expansion

circunmunclear disks in light of the results of recent simulations with massive
BHs embedded in predominantly gaseous backgrounds. After a general overview we
discuss the importance of a fast orbital decay regime dominated by global disk
torques rather than by the local dynamical friction wake. This regime can
dominate at BH binary separations of a few tens of parsecs and below, following
a phase of orbital circularization dominated by local dynamical friction. It is
similar to Type-I migration in planetary evolution. It can bring the black
holes to separations small enough for gravitational waves to take over on a
timescale ranging from less than $\sim 10^7$ yr to up to $10^8$ yr, depending
on whether the interstellar medium is smooth or clumpy. Eventual gap opening at
sub-pc scale separations slows down but does not interrupt the orbital
decay.Subsequently, we discuss a new intriguing connection between the
conditions required for rapid orbital decay of massive BH binaries and those
required for prominent gas inflows in gas-rich galaxies. We derive a condition
for the maximum inflow rate that a circumnuclear disk can host while still
maintaining a sufficiently high gas density at large radii to sustain the decay
of a BH binary. We find that gas inflows rates exceeding 10 $M_{\odot}$/yr,
postulated to form massive BH seeds in some direct collapse models, would
stifle the sinking of massive BH binaries in gas-dominated galactic nuclei.
Vice-versa, lower inflow rates, below a solar mass per year, as required to
feed typical AGNs, are compatible with a fast orbital decay of BH binaries
across a wide range of masses.

mean-field dynamo model of Chamandy et al. is generalized to allow for such
multiple co-existing spiral patterns in the kinetic alpha_k effect, leading to
the existence of magnetic spiral arms in the large-scale magnetic field with
several new properties. The large-scale magnetic field produced by an evolving
superposition of two- and three-arm (or two- and four-arm) patterns evolves
with time along with the superposition. Magnetic arms can be stronger and more
extended in radius and in azimuth when produced by two interfering patterns
rather than by one pattern acting alone. Transient morphological features arise
in the magnetic arms, including bifurcations, disconnected armlets, and
temporal and spatial variation in arm strength and pitch angles. Pitch angles
of the large-scale magnetic field and magnetic arm structures (ridges) are
smaller than those typically inferred from observations of spiral galaxies for
model parameters of Chamandy et al., but can become comparable to typically
inferred values for certain (still realistic) parameters. The magnetic field is
sometimes strongest in between the alpha_k-arms, unlike in standard models with
a single pattern, where it is strongest within the alpha_k-arms. Moreover, for
models with a two- and three-arm pattern, some amount of m=1 azimuthal symmetry

energies with the MAGIC telescopes, an exceptionally bright flare of IC 310 was
detected in November 2012 reaching a flux level of up to >0.5 Crab units above
300 GeV. We have organized a multi-wavelength follow-up program, including the
VLBA, Effelsberg 100 m, KVA, Swift, INTEGRAL, Fermi/LAT, and the MAGIC

Kerr-type nonlinear and magnetic layers under the action of an external static

periodic arrangement of alternating nonlinear and magnetic layers (a
one-dimensional photonic crystal) with one of the layers doubled to create a
defect where periodicity is violated. Strong enhancement of nonreciprocity is
observed at the frequencies of the defect modes, where linearly polarized light
incident from one side of the structure undergoes 90 deg polarization rotation
upon reflection, while light reflected from the other side has its polarization
unchanged. Using the nonlinear transfer matrix calculations in the frequency
domain, it is demonstrated that defect resonances in the nonlinear reflection
spectra undergo bending, resulting in polarization bistability of reflected
light. This bistability is shown to result in abrupt switching between linear
polarization of the output reflected light when the input intensity is varied.
This switching is confirmed in finite-difference time-domain simulations, and
its hysteresis character is established.

extending 2-dimensional (2D) resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulation model of

current sheet and bi-directional reconnection outflows just below the flux rope
during the eruption in our 3D simulations. We calculated four cases of a
strongly twisted flux rope and a weakly twisted flux rope in 2D and 3D
simulations. The time evolution of a weakly twisted flux rope in 3D simulation
shows similar behaviors to 2D simulation, while a strongly twisted flux rope in
3D simulation shows clearly different time evolution from 2D simulation except
for the initial phase evolution. The ejection speeds of both strongly and
weakly twisted flux ropes in 3D simulations are larger than 2D simulations, and
the reconnection rates in 3D cases are also larger than 2D cases. This
indicates a positive feedback between the ejection speed of a flux rope and the
reconnection rate even in the 3D simulation, and we conclude that the
plasmoid-induced reconnection model can be applied to 3D. We also found that
small scale plasmoids are formed inside a current sheet and make it turbulent.
These small scale plasmoid ejections has role in locally increasing
reconnection rate intermittently as observed in solar flares, coupled with a
global eruption of a flux rope.

detecting solar neutrinos. The detector, a large, unsegmented liquid
scintillator calorimeter characterized by unprecedented low levels of intrinsic
radioactivity, is optimized for the study of the lower energy part of the

precisely measured the flux of the 7Be solar neutrinos, ruled out any
significant day-night asymmetry of their interaction rate, made the first
direct observation of the pep neutrinos, and set the tightest upper limit on
the flux of CNO neutrinos. In this paper we discuss the signal signature and
provide a comprehensive description of the backgrounds, quantify their event
rates, describe the methods for their identification, selection or subtraction,
and describe data analysis. Key features are an extensive in situ calibration
program using radioactive sources, the detailed modeling of the detector
response, the ability to define an innermost fiducial volume with extremely low
background via software cuts, and the excellent pulse-shape discrimination
capability of the scintillator that allows particle identification. We report a
measurement of the annual modulation of the 7 Be neutrino interaction rate. The
period, the amplitude, and the phase of the observed modulation are consistent
with the solar origin of these events, and the absence of their annual
modulation is rejected with higher than 99% C.L. The physics implications of

bunch with 0.25 nC charge, compressed up to a peak current of 45 kA. An
advantage of operating at such high peak current is the increase of the x-ray
output peak power without any modification to the baseline design. Based on
start-to-end simulations, we demonstrate that such high peak current, combined
with undulator tapering, allows one to achieve up to a 100-fold increase in a

nodes of an interconnected quantum network. Unlike standard single-system
qubits, in a BEC the quantum information is duplicated in a large number of
identical bosonic particles, thus can be considered to be a ""macroscopic""
qubit. One of the difficulties with such a system is how to effectively
interact such qubits together in order to transfer quantum information and
create entanglement. Here we propose a scheme of cavities containing spinor
BECs coupled by optical fiber in order to achieve this task. We discuss
entanglement generation and quantum state transfer between nodes using such
macroscopic BEC qubits.

recovery theory of sparse signals via l_q(0<q<=1) relaxations in compressed

\delta_tk<\sqrt{1-1/t} for t>=4/3 to guarantee the exact recovery of k sparse
signals through the l_1 minimization. This paper aims to establish new RICs
bounds via l_q(0<q<=1) relaxation. Based on a key inequality on l_q norm, we
show that (i) the exact recovery can be succeeded via l_{1/2} and l_1
minimizations if \delta_tk<\sqrt{1-1/t} for any t>1, (ii)several sufficient
conditions can be derived, such as for any 0<q<1/2, \delta_2k<0.5547 when k>=2,
for any 1/2<q<1, \delta_2k<0.6782 when k>=1, (iii) the bound on \delta_k is
given as well for any 0<q<=1, especially for q=1/2,1, we obtain \delta_k<1/3
when k(>=2) is even or \delta_k<0.3203 when k(>=3) is odd.

photometric parameters of disk and bulges obtained from bulge-disk
decomposition: scale-length, effective radius, Sersic index, disk axis-ratio,
and bulge-to-disk ratio. The dust induced changes in these parameters were
obtained by fitting simulated images of composite systems (containing a disk
and a bulge) produced using radiative transfer calculations. The simulations
were fitted with the GALFIT 3.0.2 data analysis algorithm. Fits were done with
both a combination of an exponential plus a variable-index Sersic function as
well as with a combination of two variable-index Sersic functions. We find that
dust is biasing the derived exponential scale-length of decomposed disks
towards smaller values than would be otherwise derived if the galaxy were to
have no bulge. Similarly, the derived bulge-to-disk ratio is biased towards
smaller values. However, the derived axis-ratio of the disk is not changed in
the decomposition process. The derived effective radius of decomposed disks of
systems having exponential bulges is found to be less affected by dust when
fits are done with two variable-index Sersic functions. For the same type of
fits dust is found to bias the value of the derived effective radius of
decomposed disks towards lower values for systems having de Vaucouleurs bulges.

to the deviations in the value of axial vector matrix elements ratio from

  galley proofs* - to appear in ""Transactions of the AMS""",,,,"math.RA math.AG math.RT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper dwells upon two aspects of affine supergroup theory, investigating
the links among them.
  First, I discuss the ""splitting"" properties of affine supergroups, i.e.
special kinds of factorizations they may admit - either globally, or pointwise.
  Second, I present a new contribution to the study of affine supergroups by
means of super Harish-Chandra pairs (a method already introduced by Koszul, and
later extended by other authors). Namely, I provide an explicit, functorial
construction \Psi which, with each super Harish-Chandra pair, associates an
affine supergroup that is always globally strongly split (in short, gs-split) -
thus setting a link with the first part of the paper. On the other hand, there
exists a natural functor \Phi from affine supergroups to super Harish-Chandra
pairs: then I show that the new functor \Psi - which goes the other way round -
is indeed a quasi-inverse to \Phi, provided we restrict our attention to the
subcategory of affine supergroups that are gs-split. Therefore, (the
restrictions of) \Phi and \Psi are equivalences between the categories of
gs-split affine supergroups and of super Harish-Chandra pairs. Such a result
was known in other contexts, such as the smooth differential or the complex
analytic one, or in some special cases, via different approaches: the novelty
in the present paper lies in that I construct a different functor \Psi and thus
extend the result to a much larger setup, with a totally different, more
geometrical method (very concrete indeed, and characteristic free).
  The case of linear algebraic groups is treated also as an intermediate,
inspiring step.
  Some examples, applications and further generalizations are presented at the
end of the paper.

flavor-violating processes such as ${\mu} \to e{\gamma}$, $\mu \to eee$, and

Near detector measurements are used to constrain the neutrino flux and cross

downstream of the neutrino production target, collected data corresponding to
$3.01 \times 10^{20}$ protons on target. In the absence of neutrino
oscillations, $205 \pm 17$ (syst.) events are expected to be detected and only
58 muon neutrino event candidates are observed. A fit to the neutrino rate and
energy spectrum assuming three neutrino flavors, normal mass hierarchy and

spatially coupled height dependent LTE inversions of Stokes profiles to produce
high-resolution, height-dependent maps of atmospheric parameters of these
downflows and investigate their properties. High-speed downflows are observed
over a wide range of viewing angles. They have supersonic line-of-sight
velocities, some in excess of 20km/s, and very high magnetic field strengths,
reaching values of over 7 kG. A relation between the downflow velocities and
the magnetic field strength is found, in good agreement with MHD simulations.
The coupled inversion at high resolution allows for the accurate determination
of small-scale structures. The recovered atmospheric structure indicates that
regions with very high downflow velocities contain some of the strongest
magnetic fields that have ever been measured on the Sun.

the repulsive contact interactions whose local strength grows $\sim r^{4}$ from
the center to periphery, while dipoles are oriented perpendicular to the
self-trapping plane. The confinement in the perpendicular direction is provided
by the usual harmonic-oscillator potential. The objective is to extend the
recently induced concept of the self-trapping of bright solitons and solitary
vortices in the pseudopotential, which is induced by the repulsive local
nonlinearity with the strength growing from the center to periphery, to the
case when the trapping mechanism competes with the long-range repulsive DDI.
Another objective is to extend the analysis for elliptic vortices and solitons
in an anisotropic nonlinear pseudopotential. Using the variational

self-trapped modes with vorticities $\ell =0$ (fundamental solitons), $\ell

However, the scale of the data collected and the inherent stochasticity of the
underlying process pose significant challenges, requiring a careful combination
of image processing and statistical techniques. In particular, using satellite
imagery data, we develop a statistical model of atmospheric transport that
relies on a latent Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) for inference. In doing
so, we make a link between the optical flow method of Horn and Schunck and the
formulation of the transport process as a latent field in a generalized linear
model, which enables the use of the integrated nested Laplace approximation for
inference. This framework is specified such that it satisfies the so-called
integrated continuity equation, thereby intrinsically expressing the divergence
of the field as a multiplicative factor covering air compressibility and
satellite column projection. The importance of this step -- as well as treating
the problem in a fully statistical manner -- is emphasized by a simulation
study where inference based on this latent GMRF clearly reduces errors of the
estimated flow field. We conclude with a study of the dynamics of dust storms
formed over Saharan Africa and show that our methodology is able to accurately
and coherently track the storm movement, a critical problem in this field.

states cannot be mimicked using local hidden variable (LHV) models. From a
computer science perspective, LHV models may be interpreted as classical
computers operating on a potentially infinite number of correlated bits
originating from a common source. As such, Bell inequality violations achieved
through entangled states are able to characterise the quantum advantage of
certain tasks, so long as the task itself imposes no restriction on the
availability of correlated bits. However, if the number of shared bits is
limited, additional constraints are placed on the possible LHV models and
separable, i.e. disentangled, states may become a useful resource. Bell
violations are therefore no longer necessary to achieve a quantum advantage.
Here we show that in particular, separable states may improve the so-called
random access codes, which is a class of communication problems where one party
tries to read a portion of the data held by another distant party in presence
of finite shared randomness and limited classical communication. We also show
how the bias of classical bits can be used to avoid wrong answers in order to
achieve the optimal classical protocol and how the advantage of quantum
protocols is linked to quantum discord.

coloring or state of its semiedges, which satisfies the Parity Lemma.
Multipoles have been extensively used in the study of snarks, that is, cubic

For example, to enable effective vehicle routing, weighted-graph models of
transportation networks are used, where the weight of an edge captures some
cost associated with traversing the edge, e.g., greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
or travel time. It is a precondition to using a graph model for routing that
all edges have weights. Weights that capture travel times and GHG emissions can
be extracted from GPS trajectory data collected from the network. However, GPS
trajectory data typically lack the coverage needed to assign weights to all
edges. This paper formulates and addresses the problem of annotating all edges
in a road network with travel cost based weights from a set of trips in the
network that cover only a small fraction of the edges, each with an associated
ground-truth travel cost. A general framework is proposed to solve the problem.
Specifically, the problem is modeled as a regression problem and solved by
minimizing a judiciously designed objective function that takes into account
the topology of the road network. In particular, the use of weighted PageRank
values of edges is explored for assigning appropriate weights to all edges, and
the property of directional adjacency of edges is also taken into account to
assign weights. Empirical studies with weights capturing travel time and GHG

reversal (for noise-free data) does not lead to the exact initial pressure

regularized time reversal in dissipative media similar to water is a valuable

best example of mode-switching radio pulsar. Its radio emission alternates
between a highly organized state with regular drifting subpulses (B mode) and a
chaotic emission pattern (Q mode). We present the results of XMM-Newton
observations showing that the X-ray properties of PSR B0943+10 depend on its
radio state (Hermsen et al. 2013). During the radio fainter state (Q mode) the
X-ray flux is more than a factor two larger than during the B-mode and X-ray
pulsations with about 50% pulsed fraction are detected. The X-ray emission of
PSR B0943+10 in the B-mode is well described by thermal emission with blackbody
temperature kT=0.26 keV coming from a small hot spot with luminosity of 7x10^28
erg/s, in good agreement with the prediction of the partially screened gap
model, which also explains the properties of the radio emission in this mode.
We derived an upper limit of 46% on the X-ray pulsed fraction in the B-mode,
consistent with the geometry and viewing angle of PSR B0943+10 inferred from
the radio data. The higher flux observed during the Q-mode is consistent with
the appearance of an additional component with a power-law spectrum with photon
index 2.2. We interpret it as pulsed non-thermal X-rays produced in the star
magnetosphere. A small change in the beaming pattern or in the efficiency of
acceleration of the particles responsible for the non-thermal emission can
explain the reduced flux of this component during the radio B-mode.

numerical schemes which are uniformly accurate with respect to the oscillation
frequency. This is a stronger feature than the usual so called ""Asymptotic
preserving"" property, the last being also satisfied by our scheme in the highly
oscillatory limit. Our strategy enables to simulate the oscillatory problem
without using any mesh or time step refinement, and the orders of our schemes
are preserved uniformly in all regimes. In other words, since our numerical
method is not based on the derivation and the simulation of asymptotic models,
it works in the regime where the solution does not oscillate rapidly, in the
highly oscillatory limit regime, and in the intermediate regime with the same
order of accuracy. In the same spirit as in [5], the method is based on two
main ingredients. First, we embed our problem in a suitable ""two-scal""
reformulation with the introduction of an additional variable. Then a link is
made with classical strategies based on Chapman-Enskog expansions in kinetic
theory despite the dispersive context of the targeted equations, allowing to
separate the fast time scale from the slow one. Uniformly accurate (UA) schemes
are eventually derived from this new formulation and their properties and
performances are assessed both theoretically and numerically.

boundary moves as the state process X attains new maxima S. More specifically,
we set the absorbing boundary as S-b where b is a certain constant. This
problem is naturally connected with excursions from zero of the reflected
process S-X. We examine this constrained optimization with the state variable X
as a spectrally negative Levy process. The problem is in nature a
two-dimensional one. The threshold strategy given by the path of X is not in
fact optimal. It turns out, however, that we can reduce the original problem to
an infinite number of one-dimensional optimal stopping problems, and we find
explicit solutions. This work is motivated by the bank's profit maximization
with the constraint that it maintain a certain level of leverage ratio. When
the bank's asset value severely deteriorates, the bank's required capital
requirement shall be violated. This situation corresponds to X<S-b in our
setting. This model may well describe a real-life situation where even a big
bank can fail because the absorbing boundary is keeping up with the size of the
bank.

specific double scaling limit in which the blow-up radius and the string scale

the standard stabilisation methods and the optimisation based method introduced

eV/c$^2$ by measuring the endpoint region of the tritium $\beta$ decay spectrum
from a windowless gaseous molecular tritium source using an integrating
spectrometer of the MAC-E-Filter type. We discuss the idea of using the
MAC-E-Filter in a time-of-flight mode (MAC-E-TOF) in which the neutrino mass is
determined by a measurement of the electron time-of-flight (TOF) spectrum that
depends on the neutrino mass. MAC-E-TOF spectroscopy here is a very sensitive
method since the $\beta$-electrons are slowed down to distinguishable
velocities by the MAC-E-Filter. Their velocity depends strongly on their
surplus energy above the electric retarding potential. Using MAC-E-TOF, a
statistical sensitivity gain is expected. Because a small number of
retarding-potential settings is sufficient for a complete measurement, in
contrast to about 40 different retarding potentials used in the standard
MAC-E-Filter mode, there is a gain in measurement time and hence statistical
power. The improvement of the statistical uncertainty of the squared neutrino
mass has been determined by Monte Carlo simulation to be a factor 5 for an
ideal case neglecting background and timing uncertainty. Additionally, two
scenarios to determine the time-of-flight of the $\beta$-electrons are
discussed, which use the KATRIN detector for creating the stop signal and
different methods for obtaining a start signal. These comprise the hypothetical
case of an `electron tagger' which detects passing electrons with minimal
interference and the more realistic case of `gated filtering', where the
electron flux is periodically cut off by pulsing the pre-spectrometer
potential.

sourced by high energy physics. A key task today is to use the influx of
increasingly precise observational data to constrain the plethora of
inflationary models suggested by fundamental theories of interactions. This
requires a robust theoretical framework for quantifying the predictions of such
models; helping to develop such a framework is the aim of this thesis. We
provide the first complete quantization of subhorizon perturbations for the
well-motivated class of multi-field inflationary models with a non-trivial
field metric, which we show may yield interesting signatures in the bispectrum
of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The subsequent evolution of
perturbations in the superhorizon epoch is then considered, via a covariant
extension of the transport formalism. To develop intuition about the
relationship between inflationary dynamics and the evolution of cosmic
observables, we investigate analytic approximations of superhorizon
perturbation evolution. The validity of these analytic results is contingent on
reaching a state of adiabaticity which we discuss and illustrate in depth. We
then apply our analytic methods to elucidate the types of inflationary dynamics
that lead to an enhanced CMB non-Gaussianity, both in its bispectrum and
trispectrum. In addition to deriving a number of new simple relations between
the non-Gaussianity parameters, we explain dynamically how and why different
shapes of inflationary potential lead to particular observational signatures.
Candidate theories of high energy physics such as low energy effective string
theory also motivate single-field modifications to the Einstein-Hilbert action.
We show how a range of such corrections allow for consistency of single-field
chaotic inflationary models that are otherwise in tension with observational
data.

decreases from about 800 G to 600 G. A similar bimodal distribution was found

particles and fields. In particular, propagating optical waves (photons) carry
momentum and longitudinal spin determined by the wave vector and circular
polarization, respectively. Here we show that exactly the opposite can be the
case for evanescent optical waves. A single evanescent wave possesses a spin
component, which is independent of the polarization and is orthogonal to the
wave vector. Furthermore, such a wave carries a momentum component, which is
determined by the circular polarization and is also orthogonal to the wave
vector. We show that these extraordinary properties reveal a fundamental
Belinfante's spin momentum, known in field theory and unobservable in
propagating fields. We demonstrate that the transverse momentum and spin push
and twist a probe Mie particle in an evanescent field. This allows the
observation of `impossible' properties of light and of a fundamental
field-theory quantity, which was previously considered as `virtual'.

considerably. Such systems reveal very peculiar properties which distinguish
them from standard paramagnets, magnetically ordered regular systems (like
ferro-, ferri-, and antiferromagnets), or spin glasses. In particular great
amount of attention has been devoted to the so-called spin ices, in which
magnetic frustration together with the large value of the single-ion magnetic
anisotropy of a special kind, yield peculiar behavior. One of the most exciting
features of spin ices is related to low-energy emergent excitations, which,
from many viewpoints can be considered as analogies of Dirac's monopoles. In
this article we review the main achievements of theory and experiment in this
field of physics.

question of whether the iterative process can deduct all the elements of the
set of natural numbers. The demonstrated difficulties suggest that if we regard
the class of natural numbers as a set we will be confronted with either a
contradiction or a conflict with the axiom of regularity. As a result, we have
the conclusion that the class of natural numbers is not a set but a proper
class.

properties of experimentally observed phases of bulk SrRuO$_3$ - namely
orthorhombic, tetragonal, and cubic - by applying density functional theory
(DFT) approximations. At first, we focus our attention on the accuracy of
calculated lattice constants in order to find out DFT approaches that best
represent the crystalline structure of SrRuO$_3$, since many important physical
quantities crucially depend on change in volume. Next, we evaluate
single-crystal elastic constants, mechanical stability, and macroscopic elastic
parameters trying to at least partially compensate for the existing lack of
information about these fundamental features of SrRuO$_3$. Finally, we analyze
the anomalous behavior of low-temperature orthorhombic phase under $C_{44}$
related shear deformation. It turns out that at critical strain values the
system exhibits a distinct deviation from the initial behavior which results in
an isosymmetric phase transition. Moreover, under $C_{44}$ related shear
deformation tetragonal SrRuO3 becomes mechanically unstable raising an open
question of what makes it experimentally observable at high temperatures.

  (changes with respect to version v2: added section 8, modified Proposition
  2.4, added Remark 2.5, added Corollary 7.11, modified figures in the
  conclusion)",,,,"cs.LO cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study various representations for cyclic lambda-terms as higher-order or
as first-order term graphs. We focus on the relation between
`lambda-higher-order term graphs' (lambda-ho-term-graphs), which are
first-order term graphs endowed with a well-behaved scope function, and their
representations as `lambda-term-graphs', which are plain first-order term
graphs with scope-delimiter vertices that meet certain scoping requirements.
Specifically we tackle the question: Which class of first-order term graphs
admits a faithful embedding of lambda-ho-term-graphs in the sense that: (i) the
homomorphism-based sharing-order on lambda-ho-term-graphs is preserved and
reflected, and (ii) the image of the embedding corresponds closely to a natural
class (of lambda-term-graphs) that is closed under homomorphism?
  We systematically examine whether a number of classes of lambda-term-graphs
have this property, and we find a particular class of lambda-term-graphs that
satisfies this criterion. Term graphs of this class are built from application,
abstraction, variable, and scope-delimiter vertices, and have the
characteristic feature that the latter two kinds of vertices have back-links to
the corresponding abstraction.
  This result puts a handle on the concept of subterm sharing for higher-order
term graphs, both theoretically and algorithmically: We obtain an easily
implementable method for obtaining the maximally shared form of
lambda-ho-term-graphs. Also, we open up the possibility to pull back properties
from first-order term graphs to lambda-ho-term-graphs. In fact we prove this
for the property of the sharing-order successors of a given term graph to be a
complete lattice with respect to the sharing order.

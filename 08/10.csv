cataloged by Cyganowski et al, based on near-infrared narrowband H2 (2.122
{\mu}m and continuum observations from the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope.
This data set is three times larger than our previous study, and is unbiased by
preselection. As discussed in the previous paper, the morphologies of the 4.5
{\mu}m emission generally resemble those of the near-infrared continuum, but
are different from those of the H2 emission. Of our sample, only 28% of EGOs
with H2 emission show similar morphologies between 4.5 {\mu}m and H2 emission.
These results suggest that the 4.5 {\mu}m emission mainly comes from scattered
continuum from the embedded young stellar object (YSO), and partially from H2
emission. About half of EGOs are associated with H2 outflows, if the H2 outflow
incompleteness is considered. The H2 outflow detection rate for EGOs with
K-band detections (61%) is significantly higher than for those without K-band
detections (36%). This difference may be due to the fact that both H2 and
K-band emissions are associated with outflows, i.e., H2 emission and K-band
continuum are associated with shocks and outflow cavities, respectively. We
also compared the correlation between the H2 outflows and Class I 44 GHz
methanol masers from literature. The methanol masers can be located upstream or
downstream of the H2 outflows and some bright H2 spots or outflows are not
associated with methanol masers, suggesting that methanol masers and H2
emission trace different excitation conditions.

pronounced influence of decaying DM on evolution of minihalos is found in the
mass range $M=10^5-10^6\msun$, for which unstable DM with the current upper
limit of the ionization rate $\xi_{L} = 0.59\times 10^{-25}$ s$^{-1}$ depresses
21 cm optical depth by an order of magnitude compared to the standard
recombination scenario. Even rather a modest ionization $\xi \sim 0.3\xi_L$
practically ""erases"" absorption features and results in a considerable decrease
(by factor of more than 2.5) of the number of strong ($W_\nu^{obs} \simgt 0.3$

are to be more suitable for inferring physical conditions of the absorbing gas.
X-ray photons from stellar activity of initial episodes of star formation can
compete the contribution from decaying DM only at $z<10$. Therefore, when
observed the 21 cm signal will allow to follow evolution of decaying DM
particles in the redshift range $z=10-15$. Contrary, in case of non-detection
of the 21 cm signal in the frequency range $\nu<140$ MHz a lower limit on the
ionization rate from decaying dark matter can be established.

regions and associated coronal holes occurring between early 2007 and late
2010, four from cycle 23 and 10 from cycle 24. We investigate the relationship
between asymmetries in active regions' positive and negative magnetic
intensities, asymmetric magnetic decay rates, flux imbalances, global field
structure and coronal hole formation. Whereas new emerging active regions
caused changes in the large-scale coronal field, the coronal fields of the 14
decaying active regions only opened under the condition that the global coronal
structure remained almost unchanged. This was because the dominant
slowly-varying, low-order multipoles prevented opposing-polarity fields from
opening and the remnant active-region flux preserved the regions' low-order
multipole moments long after the regions had decayed. Thus the polarity of each
coronal hole necessarily matched the polar field on the side of the streamer
belt where the corresponding active region decayed. For magnetically isolated
active regions initially located within the streamer belt, the more intense
polarity generally survived to form the hole. For non-isolated regions, flux
imbalance and topological asymmetry prompted the opposite to occur in some
cases.

evolution of the log-monetary reserves of $N$ banks is described by a system of

risk is characterized by a large number of banks reaching a default threshold

  Our model incorporates a game feature where each bank controls its rate of

each bank to borrow from the central bank when its monetary reserve falls below
a critical level or lend if it rises above this critical level which is chosen
here as the average monetary reserve. Borrowing from or lending to the central
bank is also subject to a quadratic cost at a rate which can be fixed by the
regulator. We solve explicitly for Nash equilibria with finitely many players,

adding liquidity to the system without affecting its systemic risk. We also
study the corresponding Mean Field Game in the limit of large number of banks

  This part proves the following new result for the inverse Galois problem for

PSp_n(F_{l^d}) or PGSp_n(F_{l^d}) occurs as a Galois group over the rational
numbers for a positive density set of primes l.
  The result is obtained by showing the existence of a regular, algebraic,
self-dual, cuspidal automorphic representation of GL_n(A_Q) with local types
chosen so as to obtain a compatible system of Galois representations to which
the results from Part II of this series apply.

In order to take into account an effect of screening of an electron-phonon
interaction on a polaron it is assumed that the electron-phonon interaction
potential has the Yukawa form and screening of the electron-phonon interaction
is due to the presence of other electrons in a lattice. The forces are derived
from the Yukawa type electron-phonon interaction potential. It is emphasized
that the early considered screened force of

and evolution in the giant-void class of the Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) models
that best fits current cosmological observations. Here we investigate the
Luminosity Function (LF) methodology, and how its estimates would be affected
by a change on the cosmological model assumed in its computation. Are the
current observational constraints on the allowed Cosmology enough to yield
robust LF results? We use the far-infrared source catalogues built on the
observations performed with the Herschel/PACS instrument, and selected as part
of the PACS evolutionary probe (PEP) survey. Schechter profiles are obtained in
redshift bins up to z approximately 4, assuming comoving volumes in both the
standard model, that is, Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric with a
perfect fluid energy-momentum tensor, and non-homogeneous LTB dust models,
parametrized to fit the current combination of results stemming from the
observations of supernovae Ia, the cosmic microwave background, and baryonic
acoustic oscillations. We find that the luminosity functions computed assuming
both the standard model and LTB void models show in general good agreement.
However, the faint-end slope in the void models shows a significant departure
from the standard model up to redshift 0.4. We demonstrate that this result is
not artificially caused by the used LF estimator which turns out to be robust
under the differences in matter-energy density profiles of the models. The
differences found in the LF slopes at the faint end are due to variation in the
luminosities of the sources, which depend on the geometrical part of the model.
It follows that either the standard model is over-estimating the number density
of faint sources or the void models are under-estimating it.

the case of spin-symmetric randomness, where the energy gap and average order

other spacetime-free causal set approaches, e.g. Ref. [2] proposed causal sets
based on quantum information processing systems, and Ref. [3] proposed causal
sets constructed out of standard model particles. Fundamentally there are
amplitudes for causal processes in energetic causal sets, but no space-time. An
embedding of the causal processes in an emergent space-time arises only at the
semiclassical level. Hence, fundamentally there are no commutation relations,
no uncertainty principle and, indeed, no $\hbar$. All that remains of quantum
theory is the relationship between the absolute value squared of complex
amplitudes and probabilities. Consequently, we find that neither locality, nor
non locality, are primary concepts, only causality exists at the fundamental
level.

a 1Msun stellar model with metallicities Z=0, 10^{-8} and 10^{-7}. We assess
the sensitivity of nucleosynthesis results to uncertainties in the input

explaining the C, O, Sr, and Ba abundance for the star HE0107-5240 as the
result of mass-transfer from a low-mass EMP star. The drawback of our model is
that if mass would be transferred before the primary star enters the AGB phase,
nitrogen would be overproduced and the ^{12}C/^{13}C abundance ratio would be
underproduced in comparison to the observed values. Our results show that
low-mass EMP stars cannot be ruled out as the companion stars that might have

this paper, we introduce a simple test particle method to fit stream data,
using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique to marginalise over uncertainties in
the progenitor's orbit and the Milky Way halo shape parameters. Applying it to
mock data of thin streams in the MW halo, we show that, even for very cold
streams, stream-orbit offsets - not modelled in our simple method - introduce
systematic biases in the recovered shape parameters. For the streams that we
consider, and our particular choice of potential parameterisation, these errors
are of order ~20% on the halo flattening parameters. However, larger systematic
errors can arise for more general streams and potentials; such offsets need to
be correctly modelled in order to obtain an unbiased recovery of the underlying
potential.
  Assessing which of the known Milky Way streams are most constraining, we find
NGC 5466 and Pal 5 are the most promising candidates. These form an interesting
pair as their orbital planes are both approximately perpendicular to each other
and to the disc, giving optimal constraints on the MW halo shape. We show that
- while with current data their constraints on potential parameters are poor -
good radial velocity data along the Pal 5 stream will provide constraints on qz
- the flattening perpendicular to the disc. Furthermore, as discussed in a
companion paper, NGC 5466 can provide rather strong constraints on the MW halo
shape parameters, if the tentative evidence for a departure from the smooth
orbit towards its western edge is confirmed.

are more difficult to explain are those that are more surprising. The two
experiments reported here test the impact of different event outcomes
(Outcome-Type) and task demands (Task) on ratings of surprise for simple story
scenarios. For the Outcome-Type variable, participants saw outcomes that were
either known or less-known surprising outcomes for each scenario. For the Task
variable, participants either answered comprehension questions or provided an
explanation of the outcome. Outcome-Type reliably affected surprise judgments;
known outcomes were rated as less surprising than less-known outcomes. Task
also reliably affected surprise judgments; when people provided an explanation
it lowered surprise judgments relative to simply answering comprehension
questions. Both experiments thus provide evidence on this less-explored
explanation aspect of surprise, specifically showing that ease of explanation
is a key factor in determining the level of surprise experienced.

  Scalar Boson at 125 GeV in Purely Vectorial Theories",,,,,"hep-ph hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We argue that the $125 GeV$ ""Higgs"" particle is unlikely to arise as a
fermion- antifermion composite if the underlying dynamics is a vectorial gauge
theory. The reason is that the lightest scalar in such theories is heavier than
the lightest pseudo-scalar with the mass difference being fixed by the scale of
the theory. LHC searches suggest that the scale of any new physics, including
that of a putative new theory dynamically generating the 125 GeV ""Higgs""
particle, is relatively high $\sim{(1/2TeV-1TeV)}$. Also the LHC analysis
suggests that it is {\it scalar} namely $J^P = 0^+$ rather than pseudo-scalar.
Thus it is unlikely that the ""Higgs"" could arise as a composite in such
theories- though it will arise in special cases when the underlying binding
gauge group is real as a fermion-fermion bound state.
  The direct considerations of the various two point functions in the large
$N_c$ limit presented below- suggest that massless pseudo-scalars, but not any
other anomalously light meson, arise as composites of massless fermions say the
massless u and $\bar{d}$ quarks in QCD. These massless pions manifest the
spontaneous breaking of the global axial symmetry in QCD with the pions being
(pseudo) Nambu Goldstone Bosons. This offers a different insight into SXSB in
QCD and most other confining non-abelian gauge vectorial gauge theory.
Specifically we consider the euclidean two point functions $F_I|x-y|$ for
asymptotic $|x-y|$ expressed as a sum over fermionic paths. We conjecture that
for the pseudo-scalar two point function - and for that case only- self
retracing paths and closely related paths make in this limit a positive,
coherent and dominant contribution, a contribution which evades the generic
asymptotic exponential fall-off and allows the lightest pseudoscalars to be
massless. The same arguments imply that the scalars are very massive.

cognitively, is left behind and what effect might these residues have on
subsequent processing? In this paper, we probe for such after-effects using a
visual search task, performed after a task in which pictures of real-world
objects were compared. So, target objects were first presented in a comparison
task (e.g., rate the similarity of this object to another) thus, presumably,
modifying some of their features before asking people to visually search for
the same object in complex scenes (with distractors and camouflaged
backgrounds). As visual search is known to be influenced by the features of
target objects, then any after-effects of the comparison task should be
revealed in subsequent visual searches. Results showed that when people
previously rated an object as being high on a scale (e.g., colour similarity or
general similarity) then visual search is inhibited (slower RTs and more
saccades in eye-tracking) relative to an object being rated as low in the same
scale. There was also some evidence that different comparison tasks (e.g.,
compare on colour or compare on general similarity) have differential effects
on visual search.

as more complex, non-convex geometries such as hexapods with various arm

resin. Well-defined initial packing states were established through
preconditioning by cyclic loading under given confinement pressure. Starting
from such initial states, stress-strain relationships for axial compression
were obtained at four different confining pressures for each particle type.
While confining pressure has the largest overall effect on the mechanical
response, we find that particle shape controls the details of the stress-strain
curves and can be used to tune packing stiffness and yielding. By correlating
the experimentally measured values for the effective Young's modulus under
compression, yield stress and energy loss during cyclic loading, we identify
trends among the various shapes that allow for designing a packing's aggregate
behavior.

of ~12.5 Gyr at [Fe/H] < -1.7 to ~11 Gyr at [Fe/H] > -1.0. At intermediate
metallicities, the age-metallicity relation (AMR) appears to be bifurcated: one
branch apparently contains clusters with disk-like kinematics, whereas the
other branch is populated by clusters with halo-type orbits. There is no
apparent dependence of age on Galactocentric distance (R_G) nor is there a
clear correlation of HB type with age. Subtle variations in the subgiant branch
(SGB) slopes of [Fe/H] < -1.5 GCs are tentatively attributed to helium
abundance differences. Curiously, GCs with steep ""M13-like"" SGBs tend to be
massive systems, located at small R_G, that show the strongest evidence for
multiple stellar populations. The others are typically low-mass systems that,
at the present time, should not be able to retain the matter lost by
mass-losing stars. The apparent separation of the two groups in terms of their
present-day gas retention properties is difficult to understand if all GCs were
initial ~20 times their current masses. The lowest mass systems may have never
been able to retain enough gas to produce a significant population of
second-generation stars; in this case, the observed light element abundance
variations were presumably present in the gas out of which the observed cluster
stars formed.

first-principles calculations. We investigate carbyne's mechanical response to
tension, bending, and torsion deformations. Under tension, carbyne is about
twice as stiff as the stiffest known materials and has an unrivaled specific
strength of up to 7.5*10^7 Nm/kg, requiring a force of ~10 nN to break a single
atomic chain. Carbyne has a fairly large room-temperature persistence length of
about 14 nm. Surprisingly, the torsional stiffness of carbyne can be zero but
can be 'switched on' by appropriate functional groups at the ends. Further,
under appropriate termination, carbyne can be switched into a
magnetic-semiconductor state by mechanical twisting. We reconstruct the
equivalent continuum-elasticity representation, providing the full set of
elastic moduli for carbyne, showing its extreme mechanical performance (e.g. a
nominal Young's modulus of 32.7 TPa with an effective mechanical thickness of
0.772 A). We also find an interesting coupling between strain and band gap of
carbyne, which is strongly increased under tension, from 3.2 to 4.4 eV under a
10% strain. Finally, we study the performance of carbyne as a nanoscale
electrical cable, and estimate its chemical stability against self-aggregation,
finding an activation barrier of 0.6 eV for the carbyne-carbyne cross-linking
reaction and an equilibrium cross-link density for two parallel carbyne chains
of 1 cross-link per 17 C atoms (2.2 nm).

east solar events with strong bursts at 35 GHz produced near-Earth proton
enhancements of J(E > 100 MeV) > 1 pfu. The strongest and hardest those caused
ground level enhancements. There is a general, although scattered,

especially pronounced if the 35 GHz flux exceeds 10^4 sfu and the microwave
peak frequency is high. These properties indicate emission from numerous
high-energy electrons in very strong magnetic fields suggesting a high rate of

SEPs, these circumstances demonstrate significant diagnostic potential of

ratios. The result can be expressed in terms of multiple Goncharov
polylogarithms. We also employ a more restricted class of ""hexagon functions""
which have the correct branch cuts and certain other restrictions on their
symbols. We classify all the hexagon functions through transcendental weight
five, using the coproduct for their Hopf algebra iteratively, which amounts to
a set of first-order differential equations. The three-loop remainder function
is a particular weight-six hexagon function, whose symbol was determined
previously. The differential equations can be integrated numerically for
generic values of the cross ratios, or analytically in certain kinematics
limits, including the near-collinear and multi-Regge limits. These limits allow
us to impose constraints from the operator product expansion and multi-Regge
factorization directly at the function level, and thereby to fix uniquely a set
of Riemann-zeta-valued constants that could not be fixed at the level of the
symbol. The near-collinear limits agree precisely with recent predictions by
Basso, Sever and Vieira based on integrability. The multi-Regge limits agree
with the factorization formula of Fadin and Lipatov, and determine three
constants entering the impact factor at this order. We plot the three-loop
remainder function for various slices of the Euclidean region of positive cross
ratios, and compare it to the two-loop one. For large ranges of the cross
ratios, the ratio of the three-loop to the two-loop remainder function is
relatively constant, and close to -7.

observed dependence of pupal transpiration on time is attributed to an
alternation between two, essential modes, for which the deposition of a thin,
pupal skin inside the puparium and its subsequent demise are thought to be
responsible. For each mode of transpiration, the results of the Bursell (1958)
investigation into pupal dehydration are used as a rudimentary data set. These
data are generalised to all temperatures and humidities by invoking the
property of multiplicative separability. The problem, then, is that as the
temperature varies with time, so does the metabolism and the developmental
stages to which the model data pertain, must necessarily warp. The
puparial-duration formula of Phelps and Burrows (1969) and Hargrove (2004) is
exploited to facilitate a mapping between the constant-temperature time domain
of the data and that of some, more general case at hand. The resulting,
Glossina morsitans model is extrapolated to other species using their relative
surface areas, their relative protected and unprotected transpiration rates and
their different fourth instar excretions (drawing, to a lesser extent, from the
data of Buxton and Lewis, 1934). In this way the problem of pupal dehydration
is formulated as a series of integrals and the consequent survival can be
predicted. The discovery of a distinct definition for hygrophilic species,
within the formulation, prompts the investigation of the hypothetical effect of
a two-day heat wave on pupae. This leads to the conclusion that the
classification of species as hygrophilic, mesophilic and xerophilic is largely
true only in so much as their third and fourth instars are and, possibly, the
hours shortly before eclosion.

to include a variety of Glossina species by resorting to their relative,
resting water loss rates in dry air. The calculated, total water loss is
converted to the relevant humidity, at 24 $^\circ\mathrm{C}$, that which
produced an equivalent water loss in the pupa, in order to exploit an adaption
of an established survival relationship. The resulting computational model
calculates total, teneral water loss, consequent mortality and adult
recruitment. Surprisingly, the postulated race against time, to feed, applies
more to the mesophilic and xerophilic species, in that increasing order. So
much so that it is reasonable to conclude that, should Glossina brevipalpis
survive the pupal phase, it will almost certainly survive to locate a host,
without there being any significant prospect of death from dehydration. With
the conclusion of this work comes the revelation that the classification of
species as hygrophilic, mesophilic and xerophilic is largely true only in so
much as their third and fourth instars are and, possibly, the hours shortly
before eclosion.

non-volatility of nano-magnets to model fully-pipelined ASL that can achieve
higher performance. Clocking of power supply in pipelined ASL would require
CMOS transistors that may consume significantly large voltage headroom and

energy-efficiency and robustness. Exploiting the inherent isolation between the
biasing charge current and spin-current paths in ASL, we propose to stack
multiple ASL metal layers, leading to ultra-high-density and energy-efficient
3-D computation blocks. Results for the design of an FIR filter show that ASL
can achieve performance and power consumption comparable to CMOS while the
ultra-high-density of ASL can be projected as its main advantage over CMOS.

under cyclic loading is implemented in a quadratic line finite element model.
The soil rheology is modeled by mean of a multi-surface cyclic plasticity model
of the Masing-Prandtl-Ishlinskii-Iwan (MPII) type. Its major advantage is that
the rheology is characterized by few commonly measured parameters. Ground
motions are computed at the surface of soil profiles in the Tohoku area (Japan)
by propagating 3C signals recorded at rock outcrops, during the 2011 Tohoku
earthquake. Computed surface ground motions are compared to the Tohoku
earthquake records at alluvial sites and the reliability of the 1D-3C model is
corroborated. The 1D-3C approach is compared with the combination of three
separate one-directional analyses of one motion component propagated
independently (1D-1C approach). The 3D loading path due to the 3C-polarization
leads to multiaxial stress interaction that reduces soil strength and increases
nonlinear effects. Time histories and spectral amplitudes, for the Tohoku
earthquake, are numerically reproduced. The 1D-3C approach allows the
evaluation of various parameters of the 3C motion and 3D stress and strain
evolution all over the soil profile.

with a rank much less than what is sufficient for the uniqueness of the
solution of this optimization problem. We propose an algorithm based on a
smooth approximation of the rank function, which practically improves recovery
limits on the rank of the solution. This approximation leads to a non-convex
program; thus, to avoid getting trapped in local solutions, we use the
following scheme. Initially, a rough approximation of the rank function subject
to the affine constraints is optimized. As the algorithm proceeds, finer
approximations of the rank are optimized and the solver is initialized with the
solution of the previous approximation until reaching the desired accuracy.
  On the theoretical side, benefiting from the spherical section property, we
will show that the sequence of the solutions of the approximating function
converges to the minimum rank solution. On the experimental side, it will be
shown that the proposed algorithm, termed SRF standing for Smoothed Rank
Function, can recover matrices which are unique solutions of the rank
minimization problem and yet not recoverable by nuclear norm minimization.
Furthermore, it will be demonstrated that, in completing partially observed
matrices, the accuracy of SRF is considerably and consistently better than some
famous algorithms when the number of revealed entries is close to the minimum
number of parameters that uniquely represent a low-rank matrix.

planet mass and radius by ~4-7%. KELT-6b has surface gravity and incident flux
similar to HD209458b, but orbits a host that is more metal poor than HD209458
by ~0.3 dex. Thus, the KELT-6 system offers an opportunity to perform a
comparative measurement of two similar planets in similar environments around
stars of very different metallicities. The precise radial velocity data also
reveal an acceleration indicative of a longer-period third body in the system,

Generalized Lur\""{o}th Series (or GLS) has been proposed. This algorithm
(GLS-coding) encodes the input message as a symbolic sequence on an appropriate
1D chaotic map (GLS) and the compressed file is obtained as the initial value
by iterating backwards on the map. For ergodic sources, it was shown that
GLS-coding achieves the best possible lossless compression (in the noiseless
setting) bounded by Shannon entropy. However, in the presence of noise, even
small errors in the compressed file leads to catastrophic decoding errors owing
to sensitive dependence on initial values. In this paper, we first show that
Repetition codes $\mathcal{R}_n$ (every symbol is repeated $n$ times, where $n$
is a positive odd integer), the oldest and the most basic error correction and
detection codes in literature, actually lie on a Cantor set with a fractal
dimension of $\frac{1}{n}$, which is also the rate of the code. Inspired by
this, we incorporate error detection capability to GLS-coding by ensuring that
the compressed file (initial value on the map) lies on a Cantor set of measure
zero. Even a 1-bit error in the initial value will throw it outside the Cantor
set which can be detected while decoding. The error detection performance (and
also the rate of the code) can be controlled by the fractal dimension of the
Cantor set and could be suitably adjusted depending on the noise level of the
communication channel.

0.7 eV among currently known TI materials, inside which Dirac-type topological

strongly nonlinear, and strongly anisotropic evolution PDE for the step

form similar to a convective Cahn-Hilliard equation. We performed the linear
stability analysis and computed the nonlinear dynamics. Linear stability
depends on whether the stiffness is minimum or maximum in the direction of the
step growth. It also depends nontrivially on the combination of the anisotropy
strength parameter and the atomic flux from the terrace to the step.
Computations show formation and coarsening of a hill-and-valley structure
superimposed onto a large-wavelength profile, which independently coarsens.
Coarsening laws for the hill-and-valley structure are computed for two

perturbations is essential both in order to elucidate the physical mechanism
(`inflation') which generated it, and for estimating the cosmological
parameters from observations of the cosmic microwave background and large-scale
structure. Hence it ought to be extracted from such data in a model-independent
manner, however this is difficult because relevant cosmological observables are
given by a convolution of the primordial perturbations with some smoothing
kernel which depends on both the assumed world model and the matter content of
the universe. Moreover the deconvolution problem is ill-conditioned so a
regularisation scheme must be employed to control error propagation. We
demonstrate that `Tikhonov regularisation' can robustly reconstruct the
primordial spectrum from multiple cosmological data sets, a significant
advantage being that both its uncertainty and resolution are then quantified.
Using Monte Carlo simulations we investigate several regularisation parameter
selection methods and find that generalised cross-validation and Mallow's $C_p$
method give optimal results. We apply our inversion procedure to data from the
Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, other ground-based small angular scale

an infrared cutoff at $k \lesssim 5 \times 10^{-4}\; \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ (due to
the anomalously low CMB quadrupole) and several features with $\sim 2 \sigma$
significance at $k/\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1} \sim$ 0.0013--0.0025, 0.0362--0.0402 and
0.051--0.056, reflecting the `WMAP glitches'. To test whether these are indeed
real will require more accurate data, such as from the Planck satellite and new
ground-based experiments.

Bose-Einstein condensate from an initial product state through adiabatic sweep
of magnetic field across a quantum phase transition induced by competition
between the spin-dependent collision interaction and the quadratic Zeeman
effect. The generated many-body entanglement is characterized by the
experimentally measurable entanglement depth in the proximity of the Dicke
state. We show that the scheme is robust to practical noise and experimental
imperfection and under realistic conditions it is possible to generate genuine
entanglement for hundreds of atoms.

chosen weights v, the ordering condition on a measure \mu, formulated in terms
of the weighted lift zonoids of this measure, leads to certain functional
inequalities for this measure, such as non-linear extensions of Bobkov's shift
inequality and weighted inverse log-Sobolev inequality. The choice of the
weight K, involved in our version of the inverse log-Sobolev inequality,
differs substantially from those available in the literature, and requires the
weight v, involved into the definition of the weighted lift zonoid, to equal
the divergence of the weight K w.r.t. initial measure \mu. We observe that such
a choice may be useful for proving direct log-Sobolev inequality, as well,
either in its weighted or classical forms.

pedestrians and attractions, this study extends the social force model. Such
interactions lead pedestrians to form stable clusters around attractions, or
even to rush into attractions if the interaction becomes stronger. It is also
found that for high pedestrian density and intermediate interaction strength,
some pedestrians rush into attractions while others move to neighboring
attractions. These collective patterns of pedestrian movements or phases and
transitions between them are systematically presented in a phase diagram. The
results suggest that safe and efficient use of pedestrian areas can be achieved
by moderating the pedestrian density and the strength of attractive
interaction, for example, in order to avoid situations involving extreme desire
for limited resources.

scattering by Bose-Einstein condensate in an optomechanical cavity. The system
is studied using both classical and quantized mirror motions. The cavity
frequency is harmonically modulated in time for both the cases. The main
quantity of interest is the number of intracavity scattered photons. The system
has been investigated under the weak and strong modulation. It has been
observed that the amplitude of the scattered photons is more for the classical
mirror motion than the quantized mirror motion. Also, initially, the amplitude
of scattered photons is high for lower modulation amplitude than higher
modulation amplitude. We also found that the behaviour of the plots are similar
under strong and weak modulation for the quantized mirror motion.

portfolio selection problem in a dynamic setting: the investor is faced with a
Markowitz type of risk reward problem at final horizon where variance as a
measure of risk is replaced by CVaR. Based on the complete market assumption,
we give an analytical solution in general. The novelty of our solution is that
it is no longer Neyman-Pearson type where the final optimal portfolio takes
only two values. Instead, in the case where the portfolio value is required to
be bounded from above, the optimal solution takes three values; while in the
case where there is no upper bound, the optimal investment portfolio does not
exist, though a three-level portfolio still provides a sub-optimal solution.

the radial velocity technique, where periodical shifts on the measured emission
from a star provide evidence for an orbiting planet. This method has been used
on large telescopes with large and expensive instrumentation, only enabling a
small amount of observing time per star. We have developed a compact
spectrograph fed by one or several single-mode fibres that avoids the need for
complex fibre scrambling or gas absorption cells for calibration. In principle,
this will enable planet searches around bright stars over the next few years.
We aim to pave the way for large networks of small telescopes searching for
Earth-like planets. At a resolving power of R~50000, I have characterized this
spectrograph, determined its stability and the fidelity required for a
simultaneous calibration source.

algorithms of topological invariants of objects in 2D and 3D Digital Spaces. We
specifically interest in solving hole counting of 2D objects and genus of
closed surface in 3D. We first prove a new formula for hole counting in 2D. The
number of of holes is $h=1 + (|C_4|-|C_2|)/4$ where $C_4$ and $C_2$ are sets of
inward and outward corner points, respectively.
  This paper mainly deals with algorithm design and implementation of practical
computation of topological invariants in digital space. The algorithms relating
to data structures, and pathological case detection and original data
modification are main issues.
  This paper designed fast algorithms for topological invariants such as
connected components, hole counting in 2D and boundary surface genus for 3D.
For 2D images, we designed a linear time algorithm to solve hole counting
problem. In 3D, we designed also O(n) time algorithm to get genus of the closed
surface. These two algorithms are both in $O(\log n)$ space complexity.

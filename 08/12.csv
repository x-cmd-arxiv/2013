single crystal. In contrast to avalanches observed in thin films, they appear
only in a very narrow temperature interval of about a tenth of a Kelvin near
the critical temperature of Nb. At a fixed temperature, we find two sets of
dendritic structures, which differ by the magnetic field required for their
formation and by the maximum distance the dendrites penetrate into the sample.
The effect is caused by dendritic flux penetration into thin superconducting
surface layers formed in the single crystal close to the critical temperature.

monitoring of the broad line radio galaxy Arp 102B, a prototype of active
galactic nuclei with the double-peaked broad emission lines, usually assumed to
be emitted from an accretion disk.
  To explore the structure of the broad line region (BLR), we analyze the light
curves of the broad H\alpha and H\beta lines and the continuum flux. We aim to
estimate the dimensions of the broad-line emitting regions and the mass of the
central black hole.
  We use the CCF to find lags between the lines and continuum variations. We
investigate in more details the correlation between line and continuum fluxes,
moreover we explore periodical variations of the red-to-blue line flux ratio
using Lomb-Scargle periodograms.
  The line and continuum light curves show several flare-like events. The
fluxes in lines and in the continuum are not showing a big change (around 20%)
during the monitoring period. We found a small correlation between the line and
continuum flux variation, that may indicate that variation in lines has weak
connection with the variation of the central photoionization source. In spite
of a low line-continuum correlation, using several methods, we estimated a time
lag for H\beta around 20 days. The correlation between the H\beta and H\alpha
flux variation is significantly higher than between lines and continuum. During
the monitoring period, the H\beta and H\alpha lines show double-peaked profiles
and we found an indication for a periodical oscillation in the red-to-blue flux
ratio of the H\alpha line. The estimated mass of the central black hole is \sim
1.1 \times 10^8 M\odot that is in an agreement with the mass estimated from the
M-\sigma* relation.

also the Group Lasso estimator which promotes group sparsity under an a priori

high-dimensional generalized linear models to find convergence rates. We
provide oracle inequalities for the prediction and estimation error under
assumptions on the covariables and under a condition on the design matrix. We
show the ability of this estimator to recover good sparse approximation of the

problem $Q$ takes as input two feasible solutions $S$ and $T$ and determines if
there is a sequence of {\em reconfiguration steps} that can be applied to
transform $S$ into $T$ such that each step results in a feasible solution to
$Q$. For most of the results in this paper, $S$ and $T$ are subsets of vertices
of a given graph and a reconfiguration step adds or deletes a vertex. Our study
is motivated by recent results establishing that for most NP-hard problems, the
classical complexity of reconfiguration is PSPACE-complete. We address the
question for several important graph properties under two natural
parameterizations: $k$, the size of the solutions, and $\ell$, the length of
the sequence of steps. Our first general result is an algorithmic paradigm, the
{\em reconfiguration kernel}, used to obtain fixed-parameter algorithms for the
reconfiguration versions of {\sc Vertex Cover} and, more generally, {\sc
Bounded Hitting Set} and {\sc Feedback Vertex Set}, all parameterized by $k$.
In contrast, we show that reconfiguring {\sc Unbounded Hitting Set} is
$W[2]$-hard when parameterized by $k+\ell$. We also demonstrate the
$W[1]$-hardness of the reconfiguration versions of a large class of
maximization problems parameterized by $k+\ell$, and of their corresponding
deletion problems parameterized by $\ell$; in doing so, we show that there
exist problems in FPT when parameterized by $k$, but whose reconfiguration

tunneling between helical edge states occurs via two types of channels allowed

tunneling processes. Determining and controlling the effects of these two
channels is crucial to the application of helical edge states in spintronics.
We show that, despite the Hamiltonian terms describing these two processes do
not commute, the scattering matrix entries of the related 4-terminal setup
always factorize into products of p-terms and f-terms contributions. Such
factorization provides an operative way to determine the transmission
coefficient $T_p$ and $T_f$ related to each of the two processes, via
transconductance measurements. Furthermore, these transmission coefficients are
also found to be controlled independently by a suitable combination of two gate
voltages applied across the junction. This result holds for an arbitrary
profile of the tunneling amplitudes, including disorder in the tunnel region,
enabling us to discuss the effect of the finite length of the tunnel junction,

theoretically unstable to the mirror and firehose instabilities. A strong

  Intelligence, pp 87-95 (2015)",,,"cs.SY cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This Note investigates the bias of the sampling importance resampling (SIR)
filter in estimation of the state transition noise in the state space model.
The SIR filter may suffer from sample impoverishment that is caused by the
resampling and therefore will benefit from a sampling proposal that has a
heavier tail, e.g. the state transition noise simulated for particle
preparation is bigger than the true noise involved with the state dynamics.
This is because a comparably big transition noise used for particle propagation
can spread overlapped particles to counteract impoverishment, giving better
approximation of the posterior. As such, the SIR filter tends to yield a biased
(bigger-than-the-truth) estimate of the transition noise if it is unknown and
needs to be estimated, at least, in the forward-only filtering estimation. The
bias is elaborated via the direct roughening approach by means of both
qualitative logical deduction and quantitative numerical simulation.

Species distribution models (SDM) are tools used to determine
environmental features that influence the geographic distribution of species'
abundance and have been used to analyze presence-only records. Analysis of
presence-only records may require correction for nondetection sampling bias to
yield reliable conclusions. In addition, individuals of some species of animals
may be highly aggregated and standard SDMs ignore environmental features that
may influence aggregation behavior. 2. We contend that nondetection sampling
bias can be treated as missing data. Statistical theory and corrective methods
are well developed for missing data, but have been ignored in the literature on
SDMs. We developed a marked inhomogeneous Poisson point process model that
accounted for nondetection and aggregation behavior in animals and tested our
methods on simulated data. 3. Correcting for nondetection sampling bias
requires estimates of the probability of detection which must be obtained from
auxiliary data, as presence-only data do not contain information about the
detection mechanism. Weighted likelihood methods can be used to correct for
nondetection if estimates of the probability of detection are available. We
used an inhomogeneous Poisson point process model to model group abundance, a
zero-truncated generalized linear model to model group size, and combined these
two models to describe the distribution of abundance. Our methods performed
well on simulated data when nondetection was accounted for and poorly when
detection was ignored. 4. We recommend researchers consider the effects of
nondetection sampling bias when modeling species distributions using
presence-only data. If information about the detection process is available, we
recommend researchers explore the effects of nondetection and, when warranted,
correct the bias using our methods.

non-Gaussian states. The latter include, among others, known states such as
squeezed number states and de-Gaussified photon-added and photon-subtracted
squeezed states, the latter being the most efficient non-Gaussian resources
currently available in the laboratory. Moreover, it contains the classes of
squeezed Bell states and even more general non-Gaussian resources that can be
optimized according to the specific quantum technological task that needs to be
realized. The proposed experimental scheme exploits linear optical operations
and photon detections performed on a pair of uncorrelated two--mode Gaussian
squeezed states. The desired non-Gaussian state is then realized via ancillary
squeezing and conditioning. Two independent, freely tunable experimental
parameters can be exploited to generate different states and to optimize the
performance in implementing a given quantum protocol. As a concrete instance,
we analyze in detail the performance of different states considered as
resources for the realization of quantum teleportation in realistic conditions.
For the fidelity of teleportation of an unknown coherent state, we show that
the resources associated to the optimized parameters outperform, in a
significant range of experimental values, both Gaussian twin beams and
photon-subtracted squeezed states.

illustrate how the extensive work done in this arena in psychology, marketing,

occurs whether there is some canonical way to express \mu(x,\sigma). Morelli
gave an answer when X is non-singular and at least for x= \T_{n-k}(X) the Todd
class of X. However his answer takes coefficients in the field of rational
functions of degree 0 on the Grassmann manifold G_{n-k+1}(N_Q) of

non-singular toric varieties in topological contexts. Such generalized
manifolds of dimension 2n acted on by a compact n dimensional torus T are
called by the names quasi-toric manifolds, torus manifolds, toric manifolds,
toric origami manifolds, topological toric manifolds and so on. Similarly torus
orbifold can be considered. To a torus orbifold $X$ a simplicial set \del_X
called multi-fan of X is associated. A question occurs whether a similar
expression to Morelli's formula holds for torus orbifolds. It will be shown the
answer is yes in this case too at least when the rational cohomology ring
H^*(X)_Q is generated by H^2(X)_Q. Under this assumption the equivariant
cohomology ring with rational coefficients H^*_T(X,Q) is isomorphic to
H^*_T(\del_X,Q), the face ring of the multi-fan \del_X, and the proof is
carried out on H^*_T(\del_X,Q) by using completely combinatorial terms.

""effective temperature"" $T_\mathrm{eff}$. Modelling the evolution of the
radiating medium hydrodynamically, we analyze the factors controlling the value
of $T_\mathrm{eff}$ and how it is related to the evolving true temperature $T$

from fireball regions with $T{\,\sim\,}T_\mathrm{c}$ near the quark-hadron
phase transition, but that their effective temperature is significantly
enhanced by strong radial flow. Although a very hot, high pressure early
collision stage is required for generating this radial flow, we demonstrate
that the experimentally measured large effective photon temperatures
$T_\mathrm{eff}{\,>\,}T_\mathrm{c}$, taken alone, do not prove that any
electromagnetic radiation was actually emitted from regions with true
temperatures well above $T_\mathrm{c}$. We explore tools that can help to
provide additional evidence for the relative weight of photon emission from the
early quark-gluon and late hadronic phases. We find that the recently measured
centrality dependence of the total thermal photon yield requires a larger
contribution from late emission than presently encoded in our hydrodynamic
model.

event produced a fast CME, strong shock, and big particle event responsible for
GLE70. We endeavor to clarify relations between eruptions, shock wave, and the
flare, and to shed light on a debate over the origin of energetic protons. One
concept relates it with flare processes. Another one associates acceleration of
ions with a bow shock driven by a CME at (2-4)R_sun. The latter scenario is
favored by a delayed particle release time after the flare. However, our
previous studies have established that a shock wave is typically excited by an
impulsively erupting magnetic rope (future CME core) during the flare rise,
while the outer CME surface evolves from an arcade whose expansion is driven
from inside. Observations of the 2006 December 13 event reveal two shocks
following each other, whose excitation scenario contradicts the delayed
CME-driven bow-shock hypothesis. Actually, the shocks developed much earlier,
and could accelerate protons still before the flare peak. Then, the two shocks
merged into a single stronger one and only decelerated and dampened long
afterwards.

the basis for establishing a microscopic mechansim for superconductivity. For
iron pnictide superconductors, the $s^\pm$-pairing symmetry theory predicts the
presence of a sharp neutron spin resonance at an energy below the sum of hole
and electron SC gap energies ($E\leq 2\Delta$) below $T_c$. On the other hand,
the $s^{++}$-pairing symmetry expects a broad spin excitation enhancement at an
energy above $2\Delta$ below $T_c$. Although the resonance has been observed in
iron pnictide superconductors at an energy below $2\Delta$ consistent with the
$s^\pm$-pairing symmetry, the mode has also be interpreted as arising from the
$s^{++}$-pairing symmetry with $E\ge 2\Delta$ due to its broad energy width and
the large uncertainty in determining the SC gaps. Here we use inelastic neutron
scattering to reveal a sharp resonance at E=7 meV in SC
NaFe$_{0.935}$Co$_{0.045}$As ($T_c = 18$ K). On warming towards $T_c$, the mode
energy hardly softens while its energy width increases rapidly. By comparing
with calculated spin-excitations spectra within the $s^{\pm}$ and
$s^{++}$-pairing symmetries, we conclude that the ground-state resonance in
NaFe$_{0.935}$Co$_{0.045}$As is only consistent with the $s^{\pm}$-pairing, and
is inconsistent with the $s^{++}$-pairing symmetry.

Banach algebra. While the dimension of space-time is four, vortex filaments
link, because vorticities are primarily 2-forms and the corresponding 2-chains
link in four dimension; the relativistic helicity measures the linking number
of vortex filaments that are proper-time cross-sections of the vorticity
2-chains. A thermodynamic force yields an additional term in the vorticity, by
which the vortex filaments on a reference-time plane are no longer pure states.
However, the vortex filaments on a proper-time plane remain to be pure states,

we consider two types of multiple access schemes, namely, time division
multiple access (TDMA) and orthogonal frequency division multiple access
(OFDMA). At the receiver side, due to the practical limitation that circuits
for harvesting energy from radio signals are not yet able to decode the carried
information directly, each user applies either time switching (TS) or power
splitting (PS) to coordinate the energy harvesting (EH) and information
decoding (ID) processes. For the TDMA-based information transmission, we employ
TS at the receivers; for the OFDMA-based information transmission, we employ PS
at the receivers. Under the above two scenarios, we address the problem of
maximizing the weighted sum-rate over all users by varying the time/frequency
power allocation and either TS or PS ratio, subject to a minimum harvested
energy constraint on each user as well as a peak and/or total transmission
power constraint. For the TS scheme, by an appropriate variable transformation
the problem is reformulated as a convex problem, for which the optimal power
allocation and TS ratio are obtained by the Lagrange duality method. For the PS
scheme, we propose an iterative algorithm to optimize the power allocation,
subcarrier (SC) allocation and the PS ratio for each user. The performances of
the two schemes are compared numerically as well as analytically for the
special case of single-user setup. It is revealed that the peak power
constraint imposed on each OFDM SC as well as the number of users in the system

the steepest descent step size is replaced by a similar one from a previous
iteration or gets updated only once every second step, thus forming a {\em
faster gradient descent method}. For unconstrained convex quadratic
optimization these methods can converge much faster than steepest descent. But
the context of interest here is application to certain ill-posed inverse
problems, where the steepest descent method is known to have a smoothing,
regularizing effect, and where a strict optimization solution is not necessary.
  Specifically, in this paper we examine the effect of replacing steepest
descent by a faster gradient descent algorithm in the practical context of
image deblurring and denoising tasks. We also propose several highly efficient
schemes for carrying out these tasks independently of the step size selection,
as well as a scheme for the case where both blur and significant noise are
present.
  In the above context there are situations where many steepest descent steps
are required, thus building slowness into the solution procedure. Our general
conclusion regarding gradient descent methods is that in such cases the faster
gradient descent methods offer substantial advantages. In other situations
where no such slowness buildup arises the steepest descent method can still be
very effective.

stacked triangular lattice by Monte Carlo simulations. The model has three
types of interactions: the ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor interaction $J_1$ and
antiferromagnetic third nearest-neighbor interaction $J_3$ in each triangular
layer and the ferromagnetic interlayer interaction $J_\perp$. Frustration comes
from the intralayer interactions $J_1$ and $J_3$. We focus on the case that the
order parameter space is SO(3)$\times C_3$. We find that the model exhibits a
first-order phase transition with breaking of the SO(3) and $C_3$ symmetries at
finite temperature. We also discover that the transition temperature increases
but the latent heat decreases as $J_\perp/J_1$ increases, which is opposite to
the behavior observed in typical unfrustrated three-dimensional systems.

singlet fermion multiplet of SU(2)$_L$, which leads to type I+III seesaw. The
additional $10_H$ (and $\bar{10}_H$) multiplets help in achieving gauge
coupling unification while keeping the triplet fermion mass in the TeV range,
making them accessible at LHC. We study the phenomenology of this model in
detail. Large lepton flavor violation predicted in this model puts severe
constraints on the Yukawa couplings of the triplet fermion. We show that this
smothers the possibility of observing the contribution of the heavy fermions in
neutrinoless double beta decay experiments. The presence of the additional

simulations, the impact of temperature-dependent resistivity and thermal
conduction on the development of plasmoid instabilities in reconnecting current
sheets in the solar corona. We find that the plasma temperature in the current
sheet region increases with time and it becomes greater than that in the inflow
region. As secondary magnetic islands appear, the highest temperature is not
always found at the reconnection $X$-points, but also inside the secondary
islands. One of the effects of anisotropic thermal conduction is to decrease
the temperature of the reconnecting $X-$points and transfer the heat into the
$O-$points, the plasmoids, where it gets trapped. In the cases with
temperature-dependent magnetic diffusivity, $\eta \sim T^{-3/2}$, the decrease
in plasma temperature at the $X-$points leads to: (i) increase in the magnetic
diffusivity until the characteristic time for magnetic diffusion becomes
comparable to that of thermal conduction; (ii) increase in the reconnection
rate; and, (iii) more efficient conversion of magnetic energy into thermal
energy and kinetic energy of bulk motions. These results provide further
explanation of the rapid release of magnetic energy into heat and kinetic
energy seen during flares and coronal mass ejections. In this work, we
demonstrate that the consideration of anisotropic thermal conduction and
Spitzer-type, temperature-dependent magnetic diffusivity, as in the real solar
corona, are crucially important for explaining the occurrence of fast
reconnection during solar eruptions.

constructed a photoionization and dust radiative transfer model using the
spectral synthesis code Cloudy. To constrain this model, we used the PACS and
SPIRE fluxes and combined these with hitherto unpublished IUE and Spitzer IRS
spectra as well as various other data from the literature. The temperature map
combined with the photoionization model were used to study various aspects of
the central star, the nebula, and in particular the dust grains in the nebula.
The central star parameters are determined to be T_eff = 208 kK and L = 261
L_sol assuming a distance of 1200 pc. The stellar temperature is much higher
than previously published values. We confirm that the nebula is carbon-rich
with a C/O ratio of 2.1. The nebular abundances are typical for a type IIa
planetary nebula. With the photoionization model we determined that the grains
in the ionized nebula are large (assuming single-sized grains, they would have
a radius of 0.15 micron. Most likely these large grains were inherited from the
asymptotic giant branch phase. The PACS 70/160 micron temperature map shows
evidence for two radiation components heating the grains. The first component
is direct emission from the central star, while the second component is diffuse
emission from the ionized gas (mainly Ly alpha). We show that previous
suggestions that there is a photo-dissociation region surrounding the ionized
region are incorrect. The neutral material resides in dense clumps inside the
ionized region. These may also harbor stochastically heated very small grains
in addition to the large grains.

computational cost of mesh based simulation. It is particularly important for
multi-scale problems where the required number of floating-point operations can
be reduced by orders of magnitude relative to more traditional static mesh
approaches.
  Increasingly, finite element and finite volume codes are being optimised for
modern multi-core architectures. Typically, decomposition methods implemented
through the Message Passing Interface (MPI) are applied for inter-node
parallelisation, while a threaded programming model, such as OpenMP, is used
for intra-node parallelisation. Inter-node parallelism for mesh adaptivity has
been successfully implemented by a number of groups. However, thread-level
parallelism is significantly more challenging because the underlying data
structures are extensively modified during mesh adaptation and a greater degree
of parallelism must be realised.
  In this paper we describe a new thread-parallel algorithm for anisotropic
mesh adaptation algorithms. For each of the mesh optimisation phases
(refinement, coarsening, swapping and smoothing) we describe how independent
sets of tasks are defined. We show how a deferred updates strategy can be used
to update the mesh data structures in parallel and without data contention. We
show that despite the complex nature of mesh adaptation and inherent load
imbalances in the mesh adaptivity, a parallel efficiency of 60% is achieved on
an 8 core Intel Xeon Sandybridge, and a 40% parallel efficiency is achieved

find that doping with these three ions, Ti4+ (d0), Fe3+ (d5) and Ga3+ (d10),
influences both the TN and magnetic structure, unlike other Mn-site dopants
reported previously. The magnetic structure of YMnO3 is described by
considering a linear combination of irreducible representations {\Gamma}3 and
{\Gamma}4 below TN ~ 75K and with decrease in temperature the ratio of
{\Gamma}3 and {\Gamma}4 changes. The mixing ratio of these two irreducible
representations remains constant on lowering of temperature in the Ga doped
compounds. The magnetic structure is modified on doping with nonmagnetic ion
Ti4+ (d0). It is described by the basis vectors of the irreducible
representation {\Gamma}2 with moment 2.3{\mu}B at 6 K. On doping with Fe3+ (d5)
the magnetic structure immediately below TN is explained by considering the
{\Gamma}3 irreducible representation. On further lowering of temperature, a
spin reorientation at ~ 35 K is observed. Below this temperature, the magnetic
structure of YMn0.9Fe0.1O3 is explained by considering {\Gamma}3 representation
with 51% mixing of {\Gamma}4. The ordered moments are found to be reduced from
the expected value for a Mn3+ ion in all these compounds indicating the

It

$\mathbb{S}ym(\mathcal{G})$ of self-equivalences of a groupoid $\mathcal{G}$

1$, obtained when $\mathcal{G}$ is a finite discrete groupoid.
  After introducing the wreath 2-product $\mathsf{S}_n\wr\wr\ \mathbb{G}$ of

is shown that for any (finite type) groupoid $\mathcal{G}$ the permutation

that the step from the trivial groupoid $\mathcal{B}\mathsf{1}$ to an arbitrary
one-object groupoid $\mathcal{B}\mathsf{G}$ is in fact the only source of
non-splitness. Various examples of permutation 2-groups are explicitly
computed, in particular the permutation 2-group of the underlying groupoid of a

their mass mixing are deep mysteries of our universe. Recently, Majorana's
spirit returns in modern condensed matter physics -- in the context of
topological Majorana zero modes in certain classes of topological
superconductors(TSCs). In this paper, we attempt to investigate the topological
nature of the neutrino by assuming that a relativistic Majorana fermion can be
divided into four topological Majorana zero modes at cutoff energy scale, e.g.
planck scale. We begin with an exactly solvable $1$D lattice model which
realizes a $T^2=-1$ time reversal symmetry protected TSC, and show that a pair
of topological Majorana zero modes can realize a $T^4=-1$ time reversal
symmetry.Moreover, we find that a pair of topological Majorana zero modes can
also realize a $P^4=-1$ parity symmetry and even a nontrivial $\overline
C^4=-1$ charge conjugation symmetry. Next, we argue that the origin of three
generations of neutrinos(charged leptons and quarks) can be naturally explained
as three distinguishable ways of forming a pair of complex fermions(with
opposite spin polarizations) out of four topological Majorana zero modes,
characterized by the $T^4=-1$, $(TP)^4=-1$ and $(T \overline C)^4=-1$
fractionalized symmetries that each complex fermion carries at cutoff energy
scale. Finally, we use a semiclassical approach to compute the neutrino mass
mixing matrix at leading order(LO), e.g., in the absence of $CP$ violation
correction. We obtain $\theta_{12}=31.7^\circ, \theta_{23}=45^\circ$ and
$\theta_{13}=0^\circ$(the golden ratio pattern), which is consistent with an
$A_5$ flavor symmetry pattern. We further predict an exact mass ratio of the
three mass eigenstates of neutrinos with $m_1/m_3=m_2/m_3=3/\sqrt{5}$ and an
effective mass of neutrinoless double beta decay
$m_{0\nu\beta\beta}=m_1/\sqrt{5}$.

16^{3}\times 4 lattice with the clover-improved two-flavor Wilson fermion
action and the renormalization-group improved Iwasaki gauge action.
Static-quark potential is evaluated from the Polyakov-loop correlation
functions in the deconfinement phase. As the analytic continuation, the
potential calculated at imaginary \mu=i\mu_{\rm I} is expanded into a
Taylor-expansion series of i\mu_{\rm I}/T up to 4th order and the pure
imaginary variable i\mu_{\rm I}/T is replaced by the real one \mu_{\rm R}/T. At
real \mu, the 4th-order term weakens \mu dependence of the potential sizably.
At long distance, all of the color singlet and non-singlet potentials tend to
twice the single-quark free energy, indicating that the interactions between
heavy quarks are fully color-screened for finite \mu. For both real and
imaginary \mu, the color-singlet q{\bar q} and the color-antitriplet qq
interaction are attractive, whereas the color-octet q{\bar q} and the
color-sextet qq interaction are repulsive. The attractive interactions have
stronger \mu/T dependence than the repulsive interactions. The color-Debye
screening mass is extracted from the color-singlet potential at imaginary \mu,
and the mass is extrapolated to real \mu by analytic continuation. The
screening mass thus obtained has stronger \mu dependence than the prediction of
the leading-order thermal perturbation theory at both real and imaginary \mu.

important diagnostic iron lines in a realistic 3-D HD simulation. Using a
multi-level atom we compute and compare widely used Fe I line profiles at 3
different levels of approximation (3-D NLTE, 1-D NLTE, LTE). We find that the
influence of horizontal RT is of the same order of magnitude as that of NLTE,
although spatially more localized. Also, depending on the temperature of the
surroundings, horizontal RT is found to weaken or strengthen spectral lines.
Line depths and equivalent width may differ by up to 20% against the
corresponding LTE value if 3-D RT is applied. Residual intensity contrasts in
LTE are found to be larger than those in 3-D NLTE by up to a factor of two.
When compared to 1-D NLTE, we find that horizontal RT weakens the contrast by
up to 30% almost independently of the angle of line of sight. While the CLV of
the 1-D and 3-D NLTE contrasts are of similar form, the LTE contrast CLV shows
a different run. The determination of temperatures by 1-D NLTE inversions of
spatially resolved observations may produce errors of up to 200 K if one
neglects 3-D RT. We find a linear correlation between the intensity difference
of 1-D and 3-D NLTE and a simple estimate of the temperature in the horizontal
environment of the line formation region. This correlation could be used to
coarsely correct for the effects of horizontal RT in inversions done in 1-D
NLTE. Horizontal RT is less important if one considers spatially averaged line
profiles because local line strengthening and weakening occur with similar
frequency in our HD atmosphere. Thus, the iron abundance is underestimated by
0.012 dex if calculated using 1-D NLTE RT. Since effects of horizontal RT are
largest for spatially resolved quantities, the use of 3-D RT is particularly
important for the interpretation of high spatial resolution observations.

where each player's individual cost is equal to the cost he induces on society
because of his presence. Our results reveal that SCGs constitute useful
abstractions of altruistic games when it comes to the analysis of the robust
price of anarchy. We first show that SCGs are altruism-independently smooth,
i.e., the robust price of anarchy of these games remains the same under
arbitrary altruistic extensions. We then devise a general reduction technique
that enables us to reduce the problem of establishing smoothness for an
altruistic extension of a base game to a corresponding SCG. Our reduction
applies whenever the base game relates to a canonical SCG by satisfying a
simple social contribution boundedness property. As it turns out, several
well-known games satisfy this property and are thus amenable to our reduction
technique. Examples include min-sum scheduling games, congestion games, second
price auctions and valid utility games. Using our technique, we derive mostly
tight bounds on the robust price of anarchy of their altruistic extensions. For
the majority of the mentioned game classes, the results extend to the more
differentiated friendship setting. As we show, our reduction technique covers
this model if the base game satisfies three additional natural properties.

(GRBs) which show significant GeV emissions (GRB 080916C, GRB 090902B, and GRB
090926A). In addition to the standard Band model, we also use a model
consisting of a blackbody and a power-law to fit the spectra. We find that for
the latter model there are indications for an additional soft component in the
spectra. While previous studies have shown that such models are required for
GRB 090902B, here we find that a composite spectral model consisting of two
black bodies and a power law adequately fit the data of all the three bright
GRBs. We investigate the evolution of the spectral parameters and find several
generic interesting features for all three GRBs, like a) temperatures of the
black bodies are strongly correlated to each other, b) flux in the black body
components are strongly correlated to each other, c) the temperatures of the
black body trace the profile of the individual pulses of the GRBs, and d) the
characteristics of the power law component like the spectral index and the
delayed onset bear a close similarity to the emission characteristics in the
GeV regions. We discuss the implications of these results to the possibility of
identifying the radiation mechanisms during the prompt emission of GRBs.

libraries and their clients can communicate via the heap, transferring the
ownership of data structures, and can even run in a shared address space
without any memory protection. In this paper, we present the first definition
of linearizability that lifts this limitation and establish an Abstraction
Theorem: while proving a property of a client of a concurrent library, we can
soundly replace the library by its abstract implementation related to the
original one by our generalisation of linearizability. This allows abstracting
from the details of the library implementation while reasoning about the

derived from the classical one if the library does not access some of data

the electronic structure of the FeSe superconductor has been investigated
within the density functional theory. The results of the supercell calculations
reveal distinct changes of electronic structures of the substituted FeSe
systems, which can be responsible for their superconducting properties. The
replacement of Se atoms by Te or S ones yields imperfect nesting between the
holelike and electronlike Fermi surface (FS) sheets, which enhances magnetic
fluctuations responsible for superconducting pairing, thus leading to higher
values of the superconducting critical temperatures. Meanwhile, the
substitutions with transition-metal atoms for iron sites make more substantial
changes of the FSs topology, since the holelike cylinders shrink at the cost of
an enlargement of the electronlike ones. Thus, the superconducting pairing,
driven by the nesting between these sheets, weakens and superconductivity
disappears for a small percentage of dopants. The results support the idea of
spin-fluctuation mediated superconductivity in iron chalcogenides.

Dirichlet-energy and Struwe-energy. We define a quantitative stratification,
which groups together points in the domain into quantitative weakly singular
strata S^j_{\eta,r}(u) according to the number of approximate symmetries of u
at certain scales, and prove that their tubular neighborhoods have small
volume, namely Vol(T_r(\cS^j_{\eta,r}(u))< Cr^{m+2-j-\eps}. In particular, this
generalizes the known Hausdorff estimate dim S^j(u)< j for the weakly singular
strata of suitable weak solutions of the harmonic map flow. As an application,
specializing to Chen-Struwe solutions with target manifolds that do not admit
certain harmonic and quasi-harmonic spheres, we obtain refined Minkowski
estimates for the singular set. This generalizes a result of Lin-Wang. We also
obtain L^p-estimates for the reciprocal of the regularity scale. The results
are analogous to our results for mean curvature flow that we recently proved.

possible remanence and coercivity in SD regime, resultantly, the SD-nonSPM

including SD coercivity parameters in classical Langevin equations. The new
model 1) combines steady or time varying magnetisation dynamics and temperature

date, which is designed to enhance the sensitivity to the axion-photon coupling
by one order of magnitude beyond the limits of the current state-of-the-art
detector, the CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST). The IAXO detector relies on a
high-magnetic field distributed over a very large volume to convert solar
axions into X-ray photons. Inspired by the successful realization of the ATLAS
barrel and end-cap toroids, a very large superconducting toroid is currently
designed at CERN to provide the required magnetic field. This toroid will
comprise eight, one meter wide and twenty one meter long, racetrack coils. The
system is sized 5.2 m in diameter and 25 m in length. Its peak magnetic field
is 5.4 T with a stored energy of 500 MJ. The magnetic field optimization
process to arrive at maximum detector yield is described. In addition,
materials selection and their structure and sizing has been determined by force
and stress calculations. Thermal loads are estimated to size the necessary
cryogenic power and the concept of a forced flow supercritical helium based
cryogenic system is given. A quench simulation confirmed the quench protection

for a distance $D$ on some finite set $X$ there exist a uniquely determined
dendrogram on $X$ (essentially a rooted tree $T=(V,E)$ with leaf set $X$ and no
degree two vertices but possibly the root and an edge weighting $\omega:E\to
\mathbb R_{\geq 0}$) such that the distance $D_{(T,\omega)}$ induced by
$(T,\omega)$ on $X$ is $D$. Moreover, algorithms that quickly reconstruct
$(T,\omega)$ from $D$ in this case are known. However in many areas where
dendrograms are being constructed such as Computational Biology not all
distances on $X$ are always available implying that the sought after dendrogram
need not be uniquely determined anymore by the available distances with regards
to topology of the underlying tree, edge-weighting, or both. To better
understand the structural properties a set $\cL\subseteq {X\choose 2}$ has to
satisfy to overcome this problem, various types of lassos have been introduced.
Here, we focus on the question of when a lasso uniquely determines the topology
of a dendrogram's underlying tree, that is, it is a topological lasso for that
tree. We show that any set-inclusion minimal topological lasso for such a tree
$T$ can be transformed into a 'distinguished' minimal topological lasso $\cL$
for $T$, that is, the graph $(X,\cL)$ is a claw-free block graph. Furthermore,
we characterize such lassos in terms of the novel concept of a cluster marker
map for $T$ and present results concerning the heritability of such lassos in
the context of the subtree and supertree problems.

interesting from the theoretical point of view, because of the considerable
variety of dynamical behaviors that can be observed. From a technological point
of view, it is also the most relevant because it corresponds to the regime
where Kerr combs are predominantly generated, studied, and used for different
applications. In this article, we analyze the connection between the spatial
patterns and the bifurcation structure of the eigenvalues associated to the
various equilibria of the system. The bifurcation map evidences a considerable
richness from a dynamical standpoint. We study in detail the emergence of
super- and sub-critical Turing patterns in the system. We determine the areas
were bright isolated cavity solitons emerge, and we show that soliton molecules
can emerge as well. Very complex temporal patterns can actually be observed in
the system, where solitons (or soliton complexes) co-exist with or without
mutual interactions. Our investigations also unveil the mechanism leading to
the phenomenon of breathing solitons. Two routes to chaos in the system are
identified, namely a route via the so called secondary combs, and another via
soliton breathers. The Kerr combs corresponding to all these temporal patterns
are analyzed in detail, and a discussion is led about the possibility to gain

affects initiation and transformation or promotion. The objective of the
present study is to quantify the effects of radon progeny on these stages with
biophysical models. For this purpose, numerical models of mutation induction
and clonal growth were applied in order to estimate how initiation,
transformation and promotion rates depend on tissue dose rate. It was found
that rates of initiation and transformation increase monotonically with dose
rate, while effective promotion rate decreases with time, but increases in a
supralinear fashion with dose rate. Despite the uncertainty of the results due
to the lack of experimental data, present study suggests that effects of radon
exposure on both mutational events and clonal growth are significant, and
should be considered in epidemiological analyses applying mathematical models
of carcinogenesis.

generically for the spacetime horizons. We support this conclusion by two
separate arguments: 1. we generalize Bekenstein's lower bound on the horizon
area transition to much larger class of horizons than only the black hole
horizon, 2. we obtain the same entropy spectra via the asymptotic quasi-normal

oscillation (BAO). The standard Fisher matrix formalism is used to determine
the accuracy with which it will be possible to measure cosmological distances
using this signal. Earlier predictions indicate that it will be possible to
measure the dilation factor D_V with 1.9 % accuracy at z=2.5 from the BOSS
Lyman-alpha forest auto-correlation. In this paper we investigate if it is
possible to improve the accuracy using the cross-correlation.
  We use a simple parametrization of the Lyman-alpha forest survey which very
loosely matches some properties of BOSS and predicts delta D_V/D_V = 2.0 % for
the auto-correlation at z=2.5. For the redshifted 21-cm observations we
consider individual antennas of size 2 m * 2 m distributed such that the
baselines within 250 m are uniformly sampled. It is assumed that the
observations span z=2 to 3 and covers the 10,000 deg^2 sky coverage of BOSS. We
find that for 2 years of observation with an array of 2,000 antennas, the
cross-correlation is 1.7 times more sensitive than the Lyman-alpha forest
auto-correlation. The cross-correlation is 2.7 times more sensitive than the
auto-correlation if we have 4,000 antennas and 4 years of observation. In
conclusion, we find that it is possible to significantly increase the accuracy
of the distance estimates by considering the cross-correlation signal.

effective action of M theory which are related to the type IIA interactions of
the form e^{2n\phi_A} D^{6n} R^4 where \phi_A is the type IIA dilaton. The
coefficients of the M theory interactions are determined by the strongly
coupled type IIA theory. Given the nature of the dilaton dependence, it is
plausible that for low values of n, the coefficient has a similar structure as
the genus (n+1) string amplitude of the type IIA D^{6n} R^4 interaction, namely
the transcendental nature. Assuming this, and focussing on the even--even spin
structure part of the type IIA string amplitude, this coefficient is given by
the type IIB genus (n+1) amplitude, which we constrain using supersymmetry,
S--duality and maximal supergravity. The source terms of the Poisson equations
satisfied by the S--duality invariant IIB couplings play a central role in the
analysis. This procedure yields partial contributions to several multi--loop
type IIB string amplitudes, from which we extract the transcendental nature of
the corresponding M theory couplings. For n \leq 2, all possible source terms
involve only BPS couplings. While the R^4 and D^6 R^4 M theory couplings agree
with known results, the coefficient of the D^{12} R^4 interaction takes the

Foursquare, the most popular online location-based social network. We examine
the properties of city-based social networks, finding that they have common
structural properties, and that the category of place where two people meet has
very strong influence on the likelihood of their being friends. Inspired by
these observations in combination with the focused organization theory, we then
present a model to generate city-level social networks, and show that it
produces networks with the structural properties seen in empirical data.

have been suspected sources of high-energy gamma-ray emission since the COS-B
era. Theoretical models exist that characterize the underlying physical
processes leading to particle acceleration and quantitatively predict the
non-thermal energy emission observable at Earth. Aims: We strive to find
evidence of gamma-ray emission from a sample of seven CWB systems: WR 11, WR
70, WR 125, WR 137, WR 140, WR 146, and WR 147. Theoretical modelling
identified these systems as the most favourable candidates for emitting
gamma-rays. We make a comparison with existing gamma-ray flux predictions and
investigate possible constraints. Methods: We used 24 months of data from the
Large Area Telescope (LAT) on-board the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope to
perform a dedicated likelihood analysis of CWBs in the LAT energy range.
Results: We find no evidence of gamma-ray emission from any of the studied CWB
systems and determine corresponding flux upper limits. For some CWBs the
interplay of orbital and stellar parameters renders the Fermi-LAT data not
sensitive enough to constrain the parameter space of the emission models. In
the cases of WR140 and WR147, the Fermi-LAT upper limits appear to rule out
some model predictions entirely and constrain theoretical models over a
significant parameter space. A comparison of our findings to the CWB eta Car is
made.

traffic mobility models (TMMs) today do not treat other vehicles as obstacles
and thus can not model the impact of LOS obstruction in VANET simulations. In
this paper the LOS obstruction caused by other vehicles is studied in a highway
scenario. First a car-following model is used to characterize the motion of the
vehicles driving in the same direction on a two-lane highway. Vehicles are
allowed to change lanes when necessary. The position of each vehicle is updated
by using the car-following rules together with the lane-changing rules for the
forward motion. Based on the simulated traffic a simple TMM is proposed for
VANET simulations, which is capable to identify the vehicles that are in the
shadow region of other vehicles. The presented traffic mobility model together
with the shadow fading path loss model can take in to account the impact of LOS
obstruction on the total received power in the multiple-lane highway scenarios.

of the recently discovered class of Zero Determinant (ZD) strategies in
iterated 2x2 games. These strategies were reported to successfully extort pure
economic maximizers, and to mischievously determine the set of feasible
long-term payoffs in iterated Prisoners' Dilemma by enforcing linear
constraints on both players' expected average scores.
  These results are generalized for all symmetric 2x2 games and a general
Battle of the Sexes, exemplified by four common games. Additionally, a
comparison to conventional strategies is made and typical ZD gameplay
simulations are analyzed along with convergence speeds. Several response
strategies are discussed, including a glance on how time preferences change
previous results. Furthermore, a possibility of retaliation is presented: when
maximin scores exceed the minimum symmetric payoff, it is possible to extort
the extortioner.
  Finally, a summary of findings from evolutionary game theory shows that
mischief is limited by its own malice. Nevertheless, this does not challenge
the result that mindless economic maximization is subject to extortion: the
study of ZD strategies reveals exciting new perspectives and opportunities in
game theory, both evolutionary and classic.

properties of a given network are necessarily dependent on the number of edges
of that network. This problem arises in the analysis of both weighted and
unweighted networks. The term density is often used in this context, in order
to refer to the mean edge weight of a weighted network, or to the number of
edges in an unweighted one. Comparing families of networks is therefore
statistically difficult because differences in topology are necessarily
associated with differences in density. In this review paper, we consider this
problem from two different perspectives, which include (i) the construction of
summary networks, such as how to compute and visualize the mean network from a
sample of network-valued data points; and (ii) how to test for topological
differences, when two families of networks also exhibit significant differences
in density. In the first instance, we show that the issue of summarizing a
family of networks can be conducted by adopting a mass-univariate approach,
which produces a statistical parametric network (SPN). In the second part of
this review, we then highlight the inherent problems associated with the
comparison of topological functions of families of networks that differ in
density. In particular, we show that a wide range of topological summaries,
such as global efficiency and network modularity are highly sensitive to
differences in density. Moreover, these problems are not restricted to
unweighted metrics, as we demonstrate that the same issues remain present when
considering the weighted versions of these metrics. We conclude by encouraging
caution, when reporting such statistical comparisons, and by emphasizing the
importance of constructing summary networks.

scenarios with an s-wave dominated annihilation cross section, which mainly
affect the CMB close to the last scattering surface, signatures associated with
these scenarios essentially appear at low redshifts ($z \lesssim 50$) when
structure began to form, and thus manifest at lower multipoles in the CMB power
spectrum. We use data from Planck, WMAP9, SPT and ACT, as well as
Lyman-$\alpha$ measurements of the matter temperature at $z \sim 4$ to set a 95

of ~1.2e31 (d/ 6 kpc)^2 erg/s. This level, while being the lowest at which the

Hubbard models on different lattices. We use dynamical mean field theory with
iterative perturbation theory as a solver to calculate the self-energy of the
models in wide range of interaction strengths. The Seebeck coefficient, which
measures the voltage drop in response to a temperature gradient across the
system, shows a non-monotonic behavior with temperatures in the presence of
strong correlations. This anomalous behavior is associated with a crossover
from a Fermi liquid metal at low temperatures to a bad metal with incoherent
excitations at high temperatures. We find that for interactions comparable to
the bandwidth the Seebeck coefficient acquires large values at low
temperatures. Moreover, for strongly correlated cases, where the interaction is
larger than the band width, the figure of merit is enhanced over a wide range
of temperatures because of decreasing electronic contributions to the thermal
conductivity. We also find that multi-orbital systems will typically yield

between them (focussing on the Leibniz type). In particular
$\infty$-$n$-homotopies appear as the $n$-simplices of the nerve of a complete
Lie ${\infty}$-algebra. In the nilpotent case, this nerve is known to be a Kan
complex \cite{Get09}. We argue that there is a quasi-category of
$\infty$-algebras and show that for truncated $\infty$-algebras, i.e.
categorified algebras, this $\infty$-categorical structure projects to a strict
2-categorical one. The paper contains a shortcut to $(\infty,1)$-categories, as
well as a review of Getzler's proof of the Kan property. We make the latter
concrete by applying it to the 2-term $\infty$-algebra case, thus recovering
the concept of homotopy of \cite{BC04}, as well as the corresponding
composition rule \cite{SS07}. We also answer a question of \cite{BS07} about
composition of $\infty$-homotopies of $\infty$-algebras.

inward or outward depending on the thermodynamical state of the protoplanetary
disc. Zones of convergent migration exist where the Type I torque cancels out.
We study the evolution of multiple protoplanets of a few Earth masses embedded
in a non-isothermal protoplanetary disc. The protoplanets are located in the
vicinity of a convergence zone located at the transition between two different
opacity regimes. Inside the convergence zone, Type I migration is directed
outward and outside the zone migration is directed inward. We used a grid-based
hydrodynamical code that includes radiative effects. We performed simulations
varying the initial number of embryos and tested the effect of including
stochastic forces to mimic the effects resulting from turbulence. We also
performed N-body runs calibrated on hydrodynamical calculations to follow the
evolution on Myr timescales. For a small number of initial embryos (N = 5-7)
and in the absence of stochastic forcing, the population of protoplanets
migrates convergently toward the zero-torque radius and forms a stable resonant
chain that protects embryos from close encounters. In systems with a larger
initial number of embryos, or in which stochastic forces were included, these
resonant configurations are disrupted. This in turn leads to the growth of
larger cores via a phase of giant impacts, after which the system settles to a
new stable resonant configuration. Giant planets cores with masses of 10 Earth
masses formed in about half of the simulations with initial protoplanet masses
of m_p = 3 Earth masses but in only 15% of simulations with m_p = 1 Earth mass.
This suggests that if ~2-3 Earth mass protoplanets can form in less than ~1
Myr, convergent migration and giant collisions can grow giant planet cores at
Type I migration convergence zones.

provides recommendations to readers of OA journals. This paper highlights
several concerns still threatening OA publishing in the fields of SE and IS.

in semi-analytic models of galaxy formation, including partitioning of cold gas
in galactic discs into atomic, molecular, and ionized phases with a molecular
gas-based star formation recipe. We investigate two approaches for partitioning
gas into these constituents: a pressure-based and a metallicity-based recipe.
We identify DLAs by passing lines of sight through our simulations to compute
HI column densities. We find that models with ""standard"" gas radial profiles -
where the average specific angular momentum of the gas disc is equal to that of
the host dark matter halo - fail to reproduce the observed column density
distribution of DLAs. These models also fail to reproduce the distribution of
velocity widths {\Delta}v, overproducing low {\Delta}v relative to high
{\Delta}v systems. Models with ""extended"" radial gas profiles - corresponding
to gas discs with higher specific angular momentum - are able to reproduce
quite well the column density distribution of absorbers over the column density
range 19 < log NHI < 22.5 in the redshift range 2 < z < 3.5. The model with
pressure-based gas partitioning also reproduces the observed line density of
DLAs, HI gas density, and {\Delta}v distribution at z < 3 remarkably well.
However all of the models investigated here underproduce DLAs and the HI gas
density at z > 3. If this is the case, the flatness in the number of DLAs and
HI gas density over the redshift interval 0 < z < 5 may be due to a cosmic
coincidence where the majority of DLAs at z > 3 arise from intergalactic gas in
filaments while those at z < 3 arise predominantly in galactic discs. We
further investigate the dependence of DLA metallicity on redshift and
{\Delta}v, and find reasonably good agreement with the observations,
particularly when including the effects of metallicity gradients (abbrv.).

Wannier-Stark ladders in one and two dimensional crystals. We give a detailed
study for a particle in a triangular lattice under the influence of a
time-dependent electric field. A more general set of Mello-Moshinsky equations
for arbitrary lattices is presented.

action of the multiplicative group $G_m$. In this situation we define and study
a certain algebraic space equipped with an unramified morphism to $A^1\times
Z\times Z$, where $A^1$ is the affine line. (If Z is affine and smooth this is
just the closure of the graph of the action map $G_m\times Z\to Z$.)
  In articles joint with D.Gaitsgory we use this set-up to prove a new result
in the geometric theory of automorphic forms and to give a new proof of a very
important theorem of T. Braden.

data by Gautrais etal (PLoS Comp. Biol. 8, e1002678 (2012)), exploring its
parameter space beyond the parameter values determined experimentally on groups
of barred flagtails (Kuhlia mugil}) swimming in a shallow tank. A modified
model is studied alongside the original one, in which an additional frontal
preference is introduced in the stimulus/response function to account for the
angular weighting of interactions. Our study, mostly limited to groups of
moderate size (in the order of 100 individuals), focused not only on the
transition to schooling induced by increasing the swimming speed, but also on
the conditions under which a school can exhibit milling dynamics and the
corresponding behavioral transitions. We show the existence of a transition
region between milling and schooling, in which the school exhibits
multistability and intermittency between schooling and milling for the same
combination of individuals parameters. We also show that milling does not occur
for arbitrarily large groups, mainly due to a distance dependence interaction
of the model and information propagation delays in the school, which cause
conflicting reactions for large groups. We finally discuss the biological
significance of our findings, especially the dependence of behavioural
transitions on social interactions, which were reported by Gautrais etal to be
adaptive in the experimental conditions.

has emerged as a promising technology for broadband access in a Wireless
Metropolitan Area Network (WMAN) environment. In this paper, we address the
problem of queueing theoretic performance modeling and analysis of OFDMA under
broad-band wireless networks. We consider a single-cell IEEE 802.16 environment
in which the base station allocates subchannels to the subscriber stations in
its coverage area. The subchannels allocated to a subscriber station are shared
by multiple connections at that subscriber station. To ensure the Quality of
Service (QoS) performances, a Connection Admission Control (CAC) scheme is
considered at a subscriber station. A queueing analytical framework for these
admission control schemes is presented considering OFDMA-based transmission at
the physical layer. Then, based on the queueing model, both the
connection-level and the packet-level performances are studied and compared
with their analogues in the case without CAC. The connection arrival is modeled
by a Poisson process and the packet arrival for a connection by a two-state
Markov Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP). We determine analytically and
numerically different performance parameters, such as connection blocking
probability, average number of ongoing connections, average queue length,
packet dropping probability, queue throughput and average packet delay.

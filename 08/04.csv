expected-value performance functions in discrete event dynamic systems, it can
be used for performance optimization of those functions. However, when PA is
known to be unbiased, the complexity of its estimators often does not scale
with the system's size. The purpose of this paper is to suggest an alternative
approach to optimization which balances precision with computing efforts by
trading off complicated, unbiased PA estimators for simple, biased approximate
estimators. Furthermore, we provide guidelines for developing such estimators,
that are largely based on the Stochastic Flow Modeling framework. We suggest
that if the relative error (or bias) is not too large, then optimization
algorithms such as stochastic approximation converge to a (local) minimum just
like in the case where no approximation is used. We apply this approach to an
example of balancing loss with buffer-cost in a finite-buffer queue, and prove
a crucial upper bound on the relative error. This paper presents the initial
study of the proposed approach, and we believe that if the idea gains traction
then it may lead to a significant expansion of the scope of PA in optimization

for static networks to time-varying networks, where the topological structure
of the system and the temporal activity patterns of its components are
intertwined. Here we investigate the use of a latent factor decomposition
technique, non-negative tensor factorization, to extract the community-activity
structure of temporal networks. The method is intrinsically temporal and allows
to simultaneously identify communities and to track their activity over time.
We represent the time-varying adjacency matrix of a temporal network as a
three-way tensor and approximate this tensor as a sum of terms that can be
interpreted as communities of nodes with an associated activity time series. We
summarize known computational techniques for tensor decomposition and discuss
some quality metrics that can be used to tune the complexity of the factorized
representation. We subsequently apply tensor factorization to a temporal
network for which a ground truth is available for both the community structure
and the temporal activity patterns. The data we use describe the social
interactions of students in a school, the associations between students and
school classes, and the spatio-temporal trajectories of students over time. We
show that non-negative tensor factorization is capable of recovering the class
structure with high accuracy. In particular, the extracted tensor components
can be validated either as known school classes, or in terms of correlated
activity patterns, i.e., of spatial and temporal coincidences that are
determined by the known school activity schedule.

the Hamiltonian structure of the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations and, in
particular, by using three kinds of energy principles. First, the Lagrangian
variable energy principle is described and sufficient stability conditions are
presented. Next, plasma flows are described in terms of Eulerian variables and
the noncanonical Hamiltonian formulation of MHD is exploited. For symmetric
equilibria, the energy-Casimir principle is expanded to second order and
sufficient conditions for stability to symmetric perturbation are obtained.
Then, dynamically accessible variations, i.e. variations that explicitly
preserve invariants of the system, are introduced and the respective energy
principle is considered. General criteria for stability are obtained, along
with comparisons between the three different approaches.

transverse spin measurements on a quantum system; this system is initially in a
double Fock spin state, which extends over a large distance in space so that
the two operators are far away from each other. Standard quantum mechanics
predicts that, when Alice makes a few measurements, a large transverse
component of the spin angular momentum may appear in Bob's laboratory. A
paradox then arises since local angular momentum conservation seems to be
violated. It has been suggested that this angular momentum may be provided by
the interaction with the measurement apparatuses. We show that this solution of
the paradox is not appropriate, so that another explanation must be sought. The
general question is the retroaction of a quantum system onto a measurement
apparatus. For instance, when the measured system is entangled with another
quantum system, can its reaction on a measurement apparatus be completely
changed? Is angular momentum conserved only on average over several
measurements, but not during one realization of the experiment?

the multi-partitioned index vanishes. Consequently, ind(D_N) is an obstruction
to uniformly positive scalar curvature on M.

we establish a strong new localization property of the multi-partitioned index

This allows to reduce to the case where M is the product of a compact manifold

fully test related software and algorithms, researchers require a diverse pool
of data with known and desired features. Test data do not always provide this,

generate high-dimensional data in the same interface they also use for
visualization. This provides for an immersive and direct data generation
activity, and furthermore it also enables users to interactively edit and clean
existing high-dimensional data from possible artifacts. Sketch Pad ND offers
two visualization paradigms, one based on parallel coordinates and the other
based on a relatively new framework using an N-D polygon to navigate in
high-dimensional space. The first interface allows users to draw arbitrary
profiles of probability density functions along each dimension axis and sketch
shapes for data density and connections between adjacent dimensions. The second
interface embraces the idea of sculpting. Users can carve data at arbitrary
orientations and refine them wherever necessary. This guarantees the data
generated is truly high-dimensional. We demonstrate our tool's usefulness in
real data visualization scenarios.

derive the detection boundary as a function of two components: a design matrix
sparsity index and signal strength, each of which is a function of the sparsity
of the alternative. For any alternative, if the design matrix sparsity index is
too high, any test is asymptotically powerless irrespective of the magnitude of
signal strength. For binary design matrices with the sparsity index that is not

optimal; for the sparse regime, we propose an extended Higher Criticism Test

systems, such as the traffic systems, social services institutions or
organizations, or even the ecosystems. The fundamental principle underlying
complex resource-allocation dynamics is Boolean interactions associated with
minority games, as resources are generally limited and agents tend to choose
the least used resource based on available information. A common but harmful
dynamical behavior in resource-allocation systems is herding, where there are
time intervals during which a large majority of the agents compete for a few
resources, leaving many other resources unused. Ac- companying the herd
behavior is thus strong fluctuations with time in the number of resources being
used. In this paper, we articulate and establish that an intuitive control
strategy, namely pinning control, is effective at harnessing the herding
dynamics. In particular, by fixing the choices of resources for a few agents
while leaving majority of the agents free, herding can be eliminated
completely. Our investigation is systematic in that we consider random and
targeted pinning and a variety of network topologies, and we carry out a
comprehensive analysis in the framework of mean-field theory to understand the
working of control. The basic philosophy is then that, when a few agents waive
their freedom to choose resources by receiving sufficient incentives, majority
of the agents benefit in that they will make fair, efficient, and effective use
of the available resources. Our work represents a basic and general framework
to address the fundamental issue of fluctuations in complex dynamical systems
with significant applications to social, economical and political systems.

attention since the global financial crisis of 2007-2009. Recently, Beale et
al. (""Individual versus systemic risk and the regulator's dilemma"", Proc Natl
Acad Sci USA 108: 12647-12652, 2011) demonstrated that higher portfolio
diversity among banks would reduce systemic risk by decreasing the risk of
simultaneous defaults at the expense of a higher likelihood of individual
defaults. In practice, however, a bank default has an externality in that it
undermines other banks' balance sheets. This paper explores how each of these
different sources of risk, simultaneity risk and externality, contributes to
systemic risk. The results show that the allocation of external assets that
minimizes systemic risk varies with the topology of the financial network as
long as asset returns have negative correlations. In the model, a well-known
centrality measure, PageRank, reflects an appropriately defined ""infectiveness""
of a bank. An important result is that the most infective bank need not always
be the safest bank. Under certain circumstances, the most infective node should
act as a firewall to prevent large-scale collective defaults. The introduction
of a counteractive portfolio structure will significantly reduce systemic risk.

$p$-values for the strength of connection between a single vertex and a set of

number of communities in the network and their size. Moreover, ESSC can handle
overlapping communities and, unlike the majority of existing methods,
identifies ""background"" vertices that do not belong to a well-defined
community. The method has only one parameter, which controls the stringency of
the hypothesis tests. We investigate the performance and potential use of ESSC

in aqueous environment, lays the foundation of the difference in graphite and
shungite derivation under natural conditions. Low-efficient reactions in the
case of graphite do not prevent from the formation of large graphite layers
while high-efficient oxidation/reduction transforms the initial graphene flakes
into those of reduced graphene oxide of ~1nm in size. Multistage aggregation of
these basic structural units, attributed to graphene quantum dots of shungite,
leads to the fractal structure of shungite carbon thus exhibiting it as a new

salamanders as a group. Evolutionary rates are as low as those reported for
cartilaginous fish, which have the slowest rates recorded so far in vertebrates

is formulated by cardinality-constrained L2 optimization of the control
performance, which is reducible to L1-L2 optimization. The low rate random
sampling employed in the proposed method based on the compressive sampling, in
addition to the fact that the L1-L2 optimization can be effectively solved by a

reduced computational complexity, which is preferable in remote control systems

parameter is inaccessible so one must use the data to select one. Common
statistical practice is to use a variant of cross-validation for this task.
However, little is known about the theoretical properties of the resulting
predictions with such data-dependent methods. We consider the high-dimensional
setting with random design wherein the number of predictors $p$ grows with the
number of observations $n$. Under typical assumptions on the data generating
process, similar to those in the literature, we recover oracle rates up to a
log factor when choosing the tuning parameter with cross-validation. Under
weaker conditions, when the true model is not necessarily linear, we show that
the lasso remains risk consistent relative to its linear oracle. We also
generalize these results to the group lasso and square-root lasso and
investigate the predictive and model selection performance of cross-validation

cooperative--antagonistic multi-agent networks with coupled continuous-time
nonlinear dynamics. To guarantee convergence for such systems, it is common in
the literature to assume that the vector field of each agent is pointing inside
the convex hull formed by the states of the agent and its neighbors, given that
the relative states between each agent and its neighbors are available. This
convexity condition is relaxed in this paper, as we show that it is enough that
the vector field belongs to a strict tangent cone based on a local supporting
hyperrectangle. The new condition has the natural physical interpretation of
requiring shared reference directions in addition to the available local
relative states. Such shared reference directions can be further interpreted as
if each agent holds a magnetic compass indicating the orientations of a global
frame. It is proven that the cooperative multi-agent system achieves
exponential state agreement if and only if the time-varying interaction graph
is uniformly jointly quasi-strongly connected. Cooperative--antagonistic
multi-agent systems are also considered. For these systems, the relation has a
negative sign for arcs corresponding to antagonistic interactions. State
agreement may not be achieved, but instead it is shown that all the agents'
states asymptotically converge, and their limits agree componentwise in
absolute values if and in general only if the time-varying interaction graph is
uniformly jointly strongly connected.

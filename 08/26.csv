relatively prime sizes, are known as Mrs Perkins's quilts. A representation of
these dissections using graphs is presented. The edges are directed and
coloured North-South or West-East, and the graph corresponds naturally to the
dissection. This representation allowed the exhaustive generation of all
dissections up to order 18, using the plantri software. The results were
cross-checked by generating all dissections of small sizes using a direct

from Intrusion Detection System (IDS) alarms. Quantitative information flow
analysis is used to build a theoretical model of privacy leakage from IDS
rules, based on information entropy. This theoretical model is subsequently
verified empirically both based on simulations and in an experimental study.
The analysis shows that the metric is able to distinguish between IDS rules
that have no or low expected privacy leakage and IDS rules with a significant
risk of leaking sensitive information, for example on user behaviour. The
analysis is based on measurements of number of IDS alarms, data length and data
entropy for relevant parts of IDS rules (for example payload). This is a
promising approach that opens up for privacy benchmarking of Managed Security

scattering processes is of great diagnostic potential for exploring the
magnetism of the solar atmosphere. This spectrum shows an impressive richness
of spectral details and enigmatic Q/I signals, whose physical origin must be
clearly understood before they can be exploited for diagnostic purposes. The
most enduring enigma is represented by the polarization signals observed in the
D1 resonance lines of Na I (5896 A) and Ba II (4934 A), which were expected to
be intrinsically unpolarizable. The totality of sodium and 18% of barium have
hyperfine structure (HFS), and it has been argued that the only way to produce
a scattering polarization signal in such lines is through the presence of a
substantial amount of atomic polarization in their lower HFS levels. The strong
sensitivity of these long-lived levels to depolarizing mechanisms led to the
paradoxical conclusion that the observed D1-line polarization is incompatible
with the presence in the lower solar chromosphere of inclined magnetic fields
sensibly stronger than 0.01 G. Here we show that by properly taking into
account the fact that the solar D1-line radiation has a non-negligible spectral
structure over the short frequency interval spanned by the HFS transitions, it
is possible to produce scattering polarization signals in the D1 lines of Na I
and Ba II without the need of ground-level polarization. The resulting linear
polarization is not so easily destroyed by elastic collisions and/or magnetic
fields.

through time due to changes in the environment. However, most population
genetic theory assumes that the strength of selection remains constant. Here we
investigate the consequences of fluctuating selection pressures on the
quantification of adaptive evolution using McDonald-Kreitman (MK) style
approaches. In agreement with previous work, we show that fluctuating selection
can generate evidence of adaptive evolution even when the expected strength of
selection on a mutation is zero. However, we also find that the mutations,
which contribute to both polymorphism and divergence tend, on average, to be
positively selected during their lifetime, under fluctuating selection models.
This is because mutations that fluctuate, by chance, to positive selected
values, tend to reach higher frequencies in the population than those that
fluctuate towards negative values. Hence the evidence of positive adaptive
evolution detected under a fluctuating selection model by MK type approaches is
genuine since fixed mutations tend to be advantageous on average during their
lifetime. Never-the-less we show that methods tend to underestimate the rate of
adaptive evolution when selection fluctuates.

  Economics",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a unified framework for designing and analyzing algorithms for
online budgeted allocation problems (including online matching) and their
generalization, the Online Generalized Assignment Problem (OnGAP). These
problems have been intensively studied as models of how to allocate impressions
for online advertising. In contrast to previous analyses of online budgeted
allocation algorithms (the so-called ""balance"" or ""water-filling"" family of
algorithms) our analysis is based on the method of randomized dual fitting,
analogous to the recent analysis of the RANKING algorithm for online matching
due to Devanur et al. Our main contribution is thus to provide a unified method
of proof that simultaneously derives the optimal competitive ratio bounds for
online matching and online fractional budgeted allocation. The same method of
proof also supplies $(1-1/e)$ competitive ratio bounds for greedy algorithms
for both problems, in the random order arrival model; this simplifies existing
analyses of greedy online allocation algorithms with random order of arrivals,
while also strengthening them to apply to a larger family of greedy algorithms.
Finally, for the more general OnGAP problem, we show that no algorithm can be
constant-competitive; instead we present an algorithm whose competitive ratio
depends logarithmically on a certain parameter of the problem instance, and we
show that this dependence cannot be improved.

in engineering where such problems emerge in the context of distributed

classes of static stochastic convex games complicated by a parametric
misspecification, a natural concern in the control of large-scale networked
engineered system. In both schemes, players learn the equilibrium strategy
while resolving the misspecification: (1) Monotone stochastic Nash games: We
present a set of coupled stochastic approximation schemes distributed across
agents in which the first scheme updates each agent's strategy via a projected
(stochastic) gradient step while the second scheme updates every agent's belief
regarding its misspecified parameter using an independently specified learning
problem. We proceed to show that the produced sequences converge in an
almost-sure sense to the true equilibrium strategy and the true parameter,
respectively. Surprisingly, convergence in the equilibrium strategy achieves
the optimal rate of convergence in a mean-squared sense with a quantifiable
degradation in the rate constant; (2) Stochastic Nash-Cournot games with
unobservable aggregate output: We refine (1) to a Cournot setting where we
assume that the tuple of strategies is unobservable while payoff functions and
strategy sets are public knowledge through a common knowledge assumption. By
utilizing observations of noise-corrupted prices, iterative fixed-point schemes
are developed, allowing for simultaneously learning the equilibrium strategies
and the misspecified parameter in an almost-sure sense.

does not require a measure. The theory is based on the mathematical structures
defined and studied in several recent papers of the author; those papers dealt
with some specific examples of this new Toeplitz quantization. Annihilation and
creation operators are defined as densely defined Toeplitz operators acting in
a quantum Hilbert space, and their commutation relations are discussed. At this
point Planck's constant is introduced into the theory. Due to the possibility
of non-commuting symbols, there are now two definitions for anti-Wick
quantization; these two definitions are equivalent in the commutative case. The
Toeplitz quantization introduced here satisfies one of these definitions, but
not necessarily the other. This theory should be considered as a second
quantization, since it quantizes non-commutative (that is, already quantum)
objects. The quantization theory presented here has two essential features of a
physically useful quantization: Planck's constant and a Hilbert space where
natural, densely defined operators act.

heavy-flavour decay electrons and heavy-flavour mesons. Detailed understanding
of the production processes and fragmentation of heavy quarks can be obtained
by studying the azimuthal angular correlation of heavy-flavour hadrons. The
azimuthal angular correlations of heavy-flavour mesons and charged hadrons can
be used to disentangle charm and beauty-hadrons in pp collisions. In this
contribution the fraction of electrons from beauty-hadron decays in the
heavy-flavour decay electron yield is shown as well as the beauty production
cross section in pp collisions at $\sqrt\textrm{s}$ = 2.76 TeV. The
measurements are compared to the predictions from next-to leading order
perturbative QCD calculations. We also show the results from correlation
analysis of charged $\mathrm{D}^{*}$ mesons and hadrons performed using pp
collision data at $\sqrt{\textrm{s}}$ = 7 TeV.

Of States} (DOS), also known as the \emph{spectral density}, of a real
symmetric matrix $A$. The spectral density can be viewed as a probability
density distribution that measures the likelihood of finding eigenvalues near
some point on the real line. The most straightforward way to obtain this
density is to compute all eigenvalues of $A$. But this approach is generally
costly and wasteful, especially for matrices of large dimension. There exists
alternative methods that allow us to estimate the spectral density function at
much lower cost. The major computational cost of these methods is in
multiplying $A$ with a number of vectors, which makes them appealing for
large-scale problems where products of the matrix $A$ with arbitrary vectors
are relatively inexpensive. This paper defines the problem of estimating the
spectral density carefully, and discusses how to measure the accuracy of an
approximate spectral density. It then surveys a few known methods for
estimating the spectral density, and proposes some new variations of existing
methods. All methods are discussed from a numerical linear algebra point of
view.

branch (AGB) population in simple stellar systems using star clusters in the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We determine physical parameters of LMC star
clusters including center coordinates, radii, and foreground reddenings. Ages
of 83 star clusters are derived from isochrone fitting with the Padova models,
and those of 19 star clusters are taken from the literature. The AGB stars in
102 star clusters with log(age) = 7.3 - 9.5 are selected using near-infrared
color magnitude diagrams based on 2MASS photometry. Then we obtain the Ks band
luminosity fraction of AGB stars in these star clusters as a function of ages.
The Ks band luminosity fraction of AGB stars increases, on average, as age
increases from log(age) ~ 8.0, reaching a maximum at log(age) ~ 8.5, and it
decreases thereafter. There is a large scatter in the AGB luminosity fraction
for given ages, which is mainly due to stochastic effects. We discuss this
result in comparison with five simple stellar population models. The maximum Ks
band AGB luminosity fraction for bright clusters is reproduced by the models
that expect the value of 0.7 - 0.8 at log(age) = 8.5 - 8.7. We discuss the
implication of our results with regard to the study of size and mass evolution
of galaxies.

Carlo sampling of random branch outages to generate contingencies, and a model
of cascading failure to estimate blackout sizes. The risk associated with
different blackout sizes was separately estimated in order to separate small,

RTS case and a 2383 bus case indicate that blackout risk does not always
increase with load level monotonically, particularly for large blackout risk.

generator dispatch. Minimum cost methods of dispatch can result in larger long
distance power transfers, which can increase cascading failure risk.

proportional to 1/d^1.3, which can be conjectured from the expected temperature
gradient along the sample from the heat equation.

infective vertices infect each of their susceptible neighbours, and recover, at
a constant rate.
  Suppose that initially there are only a few infective vertices. We prove
there is a threshold for a parameter involving the rates and vertex degrees
below which only a small number of infections occur. Above the threshold a
large outbreak occurs with probability bounded away from zero. Our main result
is that, conditional on a large outbreak, the evolutions of certain quantities
of interest, such as the fraction of infective vertices, converge to
deterministic functions of time.
  We also consider more general initial conditions for the epidemic, and derive
criteria for a simple vaccination strategy to be successful.
  In contrast to earlier results for this model, our approach only requires
basic regularity conditions and a uniformly bounded second moment of the degree
of a random vertex.
  En route, we prove analogous results for the epidemic on the configuration

requires only that the initial values for our processes converge, i.e. it is

(type-II) outbursts. The recurrence period of these outbursts is found to be
$\sim115$ days, significantly longer than the orbital period of 111.1 days.

prior to at least four giant outbursts. The precursor recurrence period agrees
with that of the giant outbursts. The period difference of the giant outbursts

Antarctic ice into a Cherenkov detector. Muon neutrinos are detected and their
direction inferred by mapping the light produced by the secondary muon track
inside the volume instrumented with photomultipliers. Reconstructing the muon
track from the observed light is challenging due to noise, light scattering in
the ice medium, and the possibility of simultaneously having multiple muons
inside the detector, resulting from the large flux of cosmic ray muons. This
manuscript describes work on two problems: (1) the track reconstruction
problem, in which, given a set of observations, the goal is to recover the
track of a muon; and (2) the coincident event problem, which is to determine
how many muons are active in the detector during a time window. Rather than
solving these problems by developing more complex physical models that are
applied at later stages of the analysis, our approach is to augment the
detectors early reconstruction with data filters and robust statistical
techniques. These can be implemented at the level of on-line reconstruction
and, therefore, improve all subsequent reconstructions. Using the metric of
median angular resolution, a standard metric for track reconstruction, we
improve the accuracy in the initial reconstruction direction by 13%. We also
present improvements in measuring the number of muons in coincident events: we
can accurately determine the number of muons 98% of the time.

from measurement outcome statistics. There are two obvious ways to generalize
this setting. First, our task need not be the determination of any possible
input state but only some input states, for instance pure states. Second, we
may have some prior information, or premise, which guarantees that the input
state belongs to some subset of states, for instance the set of states with
rank less than half of the dimension of the Hilbert space. We investigate state
determination under these two supplemental features, concentrating on the cases
where the task and the premise are statements about the rank of the unknown
state. We characterize the structure of quantum observables (POVMs) that are
capable of fulfilling these type of determination tasks. After the general

related to the codimension of the subspace of H^{1,1} generated by algebraic
curves coming from the construction (i.e., the classes of the two fibers and
the Hirzebruch-Jung strings arising from the minimal resolution of

which constructs all regular product-quotient surfaces with given values of
gamma and geometric genus in the computer algebra program MAGMA. Being far
better than the previous algorithms, we are able to construct a substantial
number of new regular product-quotient surfaces of geometric genus zero. We
prove that only two of these are of general type, raising the number of known
families of product-quotient surfaces of general type with genus zero to 75.
This gives evidence to the conjecture that there is an effective bound of the

attention. We find that the ""body mass"" ($PV$) and ""energy consumption"" ($UV$)
of the studied forums exhibits the allometric growth property, i.e., $PV_t \sim
UV_t ^ \theta$. This implies that within a forum, the network transporting
attention flow between threads has a structure invariant of time, despite of
the continuously changing of the nodes (threads) and edges (clickstreams). The
observed time-invariant topology allows us to explain the dynamics of networks
by the behavior of threads. In particular, we describe the clickstream
dissipation on threads using the function $D_i \sim T_i ^ \gamma$, in which
$T_i$ is the clickstreams to node $i$ and $D_i$ is the clickstream dissipated
from $i$. It turns out that $\gamma$, an indicator for dissipation efficiency,
is negatively correlated with $\theta$ and $1/\gamma$ sets the lower boundary

can be used as a measure of the ""stickiness"" of forums, because it quantifies
the stable ability of forums to convert $UV$ into $PV$, i.e., to remain users

fundamental importance when mapping the star formation history out to the
highest redshifts. Before using them as efficient tools in the early Universe,
however, the environmental factors that govern the formation of GRBs need to be
understood. Metallicity is theoretically thought to be a fundamental driver in
GRB explosions and energetics, but is still, even after more than a decade of
extensive studies, not fully understood. This is largely related to two
phenomena: a dust-extinction bias, that prevented high-mass and thus likely
high-metallicity GRB hosts to be detected in the first place, and a lack of
efficient instrumentation, that limited spectroscopic studies including
metallicity measurements to the low-redshift end of the GRB host population.
The subject of this work is the very energetic GRB 110918A, for which we
measure one of the largest host-integrated metallicities, ever, and the highest
stellar mass for z<1.9. This presents one of the very few robust metallicity
measurements of GRB hosts at z~1, and establishes that GRB hosts at z~1 can
also be very metal rich. It conclusively rules out a metallicity cut-off in GRB
host galaxies and argues against an anti-correlation between metallicity and
energy release in GRBs.

of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). In this thesis, we study the
phenomenology of a class of particularly well motivated models of inflation,
known under the generic name of hybrid models. They are characterised by a
transition from a valley to a hilltop shaped potential. In particular, we study
three limiting regimes of the simplest realisation, hybrid inflation,
constraining its parameter space using observational bounds on the spectral
index and the non-gaussianity of the primordial perturbations. We find that the
model is highly constrained by observations, with large part of the parameter
space either ruled out by a blue spectral index ($n_s>1$) or by a large
non-gaussianity parameter $f_{rm NL}$, two quantities measured with precision
by PLANCK. However, there exists regions in parameter space leading to
interesting phenomenology compatibly with observational bounds. Also, a version
of hybrid inflation with a third light scalar field at horizon crossing is
derived from the supersymmetry framework. We find that the model can generate
observables within observational bounds.

Heterogeneity means that some nodes in the network are massively connected,

that for almost every random network and almost all initial conditions the high

collapse (CC) of BSGs. The metallicity of the explosion sites of the known BSG
SNe is investigated, as well as their association to star-forming regions. Both
indirect and direct metallicity measurements of 13 BSG SN host galaxies are
presented, and compared to those of other CC SN types. Indirect measurements
are based on the known luminosity-metallicity relation and on published
metallicity gradients of spiral galaxies. To provide direct estimates based on
strong line diagnostics, we obtained spectra of each BSG SN host both at the SN
explosion site and at the positions of other HII regions. Continuum-subtracted
Ha images allowed us to quantify the association between BSG SNe and
star-forming regions. BSG SNe explode either in low-luminosity galaxies or at
large distances from the nuclei of luminous hosts. Therefore, their indirectly
measured metallicities are typically lower than those of SNe IIP and Ibc. This
is confirmed by the direct estimates, which show slightly sub-solar values
(12+log(O/H)=8.3-8.4 dex), similar to that of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC),
where SN 1987A exploded. However, two SNe (1998A and 2004em) were found at near
solar metallicity. SNe IIb have a metallicity distribution similar to that of
BSG SNe. Finally, the association to star-forming regions is similar among BSG
SNe, SNe IIP and IIn. Our results suggest that LMC metal abundances play a role
in the formation of some 1987A-like SNe. This would naturally fit in a single
star scenario for the progenitors. However, the existence of two events at
nearly solar metallicity suggests that also other channels, e.g. binarity,
contribute to produce BSG SNe.

paper we introduce a new algorithm in order to tackle the blind separation of
non-negative sparse sources from noisy measurements. We first show that
sparsity and non-negativity constraints have to be carefully applied on the
sought-after solution. In fact, improperly constrained solutions are unlikely
to be stable and are therefore sub-optimal. The proposed algorithm, named nGMCA

proximal calculus techniques to provide properly constrained solutions. The
performance of nGMCA compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms is
demonstrated by numerical experiments encompassing a wide variety of settings,

into domains as the result of biochemical maturation. We propose that the
dynamical competition between maturation and lateral segregation of membrane
components regulates domain formation. We study a two- component fluid membrane
in which enzymatic reaction irreversibly converts one component into another,
and phase separation triggers the formation of transient membrane domains. The
maximum domains size is shown to depend on the maturation rate as a power-law
similar to the one observed for domain growth with time in the absence of
maturation, despite this time dependence not being verified in the case of
irreversible maturation. This control of domain size by enzymatic activity
could play a critical role in intra-organelle dynamics.

assuming strong protostellar X-ray emission and (ii) a two-dimensional (2D)
model including emission in the far UV (FUV, 6 -- 13.6 eV) irradiating the
outflow walls that separate the outflowing gas and infalling envelope material.
We confirm that the effect of FUV in two dimensional models with enlarged

FUV irradiation is CH+, enhanced in abundance by more than 5 orders of
magnitude. The HIFI observations of CH+ lines agree with the two-dimensional

there is no unanimous consensus on the extent (or even the existence) of the
discrepancy and on its connection with other stellar properties (e.g.
metallicity, magnetic activity). We investigate the radius discrepancy
phenomenon using the best data currently available (accuracy about 5%). We have
constructed a grid of stellar models covering the entire range of low mass
stars (0.1-1.25 M_sun) and various choices of the metallicity and of the mixing
length parameter \alpha. We used an improved version of the Yale Rotational
stellar Evolution Code (YREC), implementing surface boundary conditions based
on the most up-to-date PHOENIX atmosphere models. Our models are in good
agreement with others in the literature and improve and extend the low mass end
of the Yale-Yonsei isochrones. Our calculations include rotation-related
quantities, such as moments of inertia and convective turnover time scales,
useful in studies of magnetic activity and rotational evolution of solar-like
stars. Consistently with previous works, we find that both binaries and single
stars have radii inflated by about 3% with respect to the theoretical models;
among binaries, the components of short orbital period systems are found to be
the most deviant. We conclude that both binaries and single stars are

comparison between chromospheric and coronal emissions. Both X-ray and Halpha
luminosity as measured in terms of the bolometric luminosity are independent of
the effective temperature for early-M stars but decline toward the end of the
spectral M sequence. For the saturated early-M stars the average emission level
is almost one dex higher for X-rays than for Halpha: log(L_x/L_bol) = -2.85 +-
0.36 vs. log(L_Halpha/L_bol) = -3.72 +- 0.21. When all chromospheric emission
lines (including the Balmer series up to H11, CaII HK, the CaII infrared
triplet, and several HeI lines) are summed up the coronal flux still dominates
that of the chromosphere, typically by a factor 2-5. Flux-flux relations
between activity diagnostics that probe different atmospheric layers (from the
lower chromosphere to the corona) separate our sample of active pre-main
sequence stars from the bulk of field M dwarfs studied in the literature. Flux
ratios between individual optical emission lines show a smooth dependence on
the effective temperature. The Balmer decrements can roughly be reproduced by
an NLTE radiative transfer model devised for another young star of similar age.
Future, more complete chromospheric model grids can be tested against this data
set.

fast-timing spectroscopy. A level scheme of Fe-65 populated following the
beta-decay of Mn-65 was established for the first time. It includes 41 levels
and 85 transitions. The excitation energy of the beta-decaying isomer in Fe-65
has been precisely determined at 393.7(2) keV. The beta delayed neutron
emission branch was measured as Pn = 7.9(12)%, which cannot be reconciled with
the previously reported value of 21.0(5)%. Four gamma-rays and four excited
states in Fe-64 were identified as being populated following the beta-n decay.
Four lifetimes and five lifetime limits in the subnanosecond range have been
measured using the Advanced Time-Delayed Method. The level scheme is compared
with shell-model calculations. Tentative spin and parity assignments are
proposed based on the observed transition rates, the calculations and the
systematics of the region.

central extension. We compute the mass and angular momentum of the dS black

network coding are proposed for two way relaying network. Upon a failed
transmission of a packet, the network enters cooperation phase, where the
retransmission of the packets is aided by the relay node. The proposed approach
integrates network coding into cooperative ARQ, aiming to improve the network
throughput by reducing the number of retransmissions. For successive
retransmission, three different methods for choosing the retransmitting node
are considered. The throughput of the methods are analyzed and compared. The
analysis is based on binary Markov channel which takes the correlation of the
channel coefficients in time into account. Analytical results show that the
proposed use of network coding result in throughput performance superior to
traditional ARQ and cooperative ARQ without network coding. It is also observed
that correlation can have significant effect on the performance of the proposed
cooperative network coded ARQ approach. In particular the proposed approach is
advantageous for slow to moderately fast fading channels.

model predicts or a particle some new physics has in its low energy effective
theory. Also the long-standing problems concerning the property of Higgs and
its interactions are still there, and we still do not have any conclusive
argument of the origin of the Higgs itself.
  In this article we focus on higher-dimensional theories as new physics. First
we give a brief review of their representative scenarios and closely related
4-dimensional scenarios. Among them, we mainly discuss two interesting
possibilities of the origin of the Higgs: Higgs as a gauge boson and Higgs as a
(pseudo) Nambu-Goldstone boson.
  Next, we argue that theories of new physics are divided into two categories,
i.e. theories with normal Higgs interactions and those with anomalous Higgs
interactions. Interestingly both of two candidates concerning the origin of the
Higgs mentioned above predict characteristic ""anomalous"" Higgs interactions,
such as the deviation of the Yukawa couplings from the standard model
predictions. Such deviations can be hopefully investigated by the precision
tests of Higgs interactions at the planned ILC experiment.
  Also discussed is the main decay mode of the Higgs, $H \to \gamma \gamma$.
Again, theories belonging different categories are known to predict remarkably
different new physics contributions to this important process.

asymptotic properties of certain discrete isometry groups. First we give a
detailed description of the structure of the geometric limit set and relate it
to the limit cone; moreover, we show that the action of the group on a quotient
of the regular geometric boundary of X is minimal and proximal. This is
completely analogous to the case of Zariski dense discrete subgroups of
semi-simple Lie groups acting on the associated symmetric space. In the second
part of the paper we study the distribution of orbit points in X: As a
generalization of the critical exponent we consider the exponential growth rate
of the number of orbit points in X with a prescribed ""slope"". We show in
particular that this exponential growth rate is strictly positive in the
relative interior of the limit cone and that there exists a unique slope for
which it is maximal and equal to the critical exponent.
  We notice that an interesting class of product spaces as above comes from the
second alternative in the Rank Rigidity Theorem for CAT(0)-cube complexes:
Given a finite-dimensional CAT(0)-cube complex X and a group G of automorphisms
without fixed point in the geometric compactification of X, then either G
contains a rank one isometry or there exists a convex F-invariant subcomplex of
X which is a product of two unbounded cube subcomplexes; in the latter case one
inductively gets a convex G-invariant subcomplex of X which can be decomposed
into a finite product of rank one Hadamard spaces. So our results imply in
particular that classical properties of discrete subgroups of higher rank Lie
groups (as stated e.g. by Y. Benoist and J.F. Quint) also hold for certain
discrete isometry groups of reducible CAT(0)-cube complexes.

the usage of only one view in the rewritten query. Algorithms for richer
classes of XPath rewritings, using intersection or joins on node identifiers,
have been proposed, but they either lack completeness guarantees, or require
additional information about the data. We identify the tightest restrictions
under which an XPath can be rewritten in polynomial time using an intersection
of views and propose an algorithm that works for any documents or type of
identifiers. As a side-effect, we analyze the complexity of the related problem
of deciding if an XPath with intersection can be equivalently rewritten as one
without intersection or union. We extend our formal study of the view-based
rewriting problem for XPath by describing also (i) algorithms for more complex
rewrite plans, with no limitations on the number of intersection and navigation
steps inside view outputs they employ, and (ii) adaptations of our techniques
to deal with XML documents without persistent node Ids, in the presence of XML

equations over a torsion-free $\delta$-hyperbolic group. The situation is much
more delicate than in free groups. As byproduct we improve the estimation of

multivariate covariate information into a scalar to allow estimation of causal
effects without specifying a model for how each covariate relates to the
outcome. Avoiding specification of a detailed model for the outcome response
surface is valuable for robust estimation of causal effects, but this strategy
is at odds with the use of Bayes theorem, which presupposes a full probability

developed an algorithm based on iterative alternating minimization which
iteratively detects the location and the value of the taps. This algorithms
involves an approximate Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) probability scheme for
detection of the location of taps, while a least square method is used for
estimating the values at each iteration. In this work, based on the method of
factor graphs and message passing algorithms, we will compute an exact solution
for the MAP estimation problem. Indeed, we first find a factor graph model of
this problem, and then perform the well-known min-sum algorithm on the edges of
this graph. Consequently, we will find an exact estimator for the MAP problem
that its complexity grows linearly with respect to the channel memory. By
substituting this estimator in the mentioned alternating minimization method,
we will propose an estimator that will nearly achieve the Cramer-Rao bound of
the genie-aided estimation of sparse channels (estimation based on knowing the
location of non-zero taps of the channel), while it can perform faster than
most of the proposed algorithms in literature.

temperature by epitaxial stabilization of strontium cobaltites (SrCoOx) grown
directly as one of two distinct crystalline phases, either the perovskite
SrCoO3-{\delta} or the brownmillerite SrCoO2.5. Importantly, these two phases
can be reversibly switched at a remarkably reduced temperature (200~300
{\deg}C) in a considerably short time (< 1 min) without destroying the parent
framework. The fast, low temperature redox activity in SrCoO3-{\delta} is
attributed to a small Gibbs free energy difference between two topotatic
phases. Our findings thus provide useful information for developing highly
sensitive electrochemical sensors and low temperature cathode materials.

transition probability between two quantum states and that this probability
cannot be treated as a quantum extension of the classical conditional
probability. The Wigner distribution is shown to be a weighted transition
probability that cannot be accepted as a quantum extension of the classical

introducing composite events in multichannel measurements. The notion of
measurements under uncertainty is defined. We demonstrate that the necessary

for frequency recognition in steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based
brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Despite its efficiency, a potential problem
is that using pre-constructed sine-cosine waves as the required reference
signals in the CCA method often does not result in the optimal recognition
accuracy due to their lack of features from the real EEG data. To address this
problem, this study proposes a novel method based on multiset canonical
correlation analysis (MsetCCA) to optimize the reference signals used in the
CCA method for SSVEP frequency recognition. The MsetCCA method learns multiple
linear transforms that implement joint spatial filtering to maximize the
overall correlation among canonical variates, and hence extracts SSVEP common
features from multiple sets of EEG data recorded at the same stimulus
frequency. The optimized reference signals are formed by combination of the
common features and completely based on training data. Experimental study with
EEG data from ten healthy subjects demonstrates that the MsetCCA method
improves the recognition accuracy of SSVEP frequency in comparison with the CCA
method and other two competing methods (multiway CCA (MwayCCA) and phase
constrained CCA (PCCA)), especially for a small number of channels and a short
time window length. The superiority indicates that the proposed MsetCCA method
is a new promising candidate for frequency recognition in SSVEP-based BCIs.

carried out to detect periodic modulations contained in their intensity versus
frequency spectrum. A statistically significant signal was found for 223
galaxies while the spectra of 0.9 million galaxies were observed. A plot of the
periods as a function of redshift clearly shows that the effect is real without
any doubt, because they are quantized at two base periods that increase with
redshift in two very tight parallel linear relations. I suggest that it could
be caused by light bursts separated by times of the order of 10-13 seconds
because it was the original reason for searching for the spectral periodicity
but other causes may be possible. As another possible cause, I investigate the
hypothesis that the modulation is generated by the Fourier transform of
spectral lines, concluding that it is not valid. Although the light bursts
suggestion implies absurdly high temperatures, it is supported by the fact that
the Crab pulsar also has extremely short unresolved pulses (<0.5 nanosecond)
that also imply absurdly high temperatures. Furthermore, the radio spectrum of
the Crab pulsar also has spectral bands similar to those that have been
detected. Finally, decreasing the signal to noise threshold of detection gave
results consistent with beamed signals having a small beam divergence, as
expected from non-thermal sources that send a jet, like those seen in pulsars.
Considering that galaxy centers contain massive black holes, exotic black hole
physics may be responsible for the spectral modulation. However, at this stage,
this is only a hypothesis to be confirmed with further work.

dependence of the escape rates and reactivities on the driving forces. Partial
caging in state space and reduction of dynamical activity with increased

(SFR) and efficiency (SFE) in molecular clouds (MCs) on the maximum mass
reached by the clouds, based on a previously-published model for MC and SFR
evolution in which the clouds were assumed to be undergoing global collapse,
and the SFR was controlled by ioniztion feedback. Because the model neglects
various other processes, the results presented are upper limits. We find that
clouds with $\Mmax \lesssim 10^4 \Msun$ end their lives with a mini-burst, at
which the SFR reaches a peak of $\sim 10^4 ~\Msun \Myr^{-1}$, although its time
average is only $\SFRavg \sim \hbox{ a few} \times 10^2 \Msun \Myr^{-1}$. The
corresponding efficiencies are $\SFEmax \lesssim $60\%$ and $\SFEavg \lesssim
$1\%$. For more massive clouds ($\Mmax \gtrsim 10^5 ~ \Msun$), the SFR first
increases and then remains roughly constant for $\sim 10^7$ yr, because the
clouds are influenced by the stellar feedback since earlier in their evolution.
We find that $\SFRavg$ and $\SFEavg$ are well represented by the fits $\SFRavg
\approx 100 (1+\Mmax/2 \times 10^5 ~ \Msun)^{2} ~ \Msun \Myr^{-1}$ and $\SFEavg
\approx 0.024 (\Mmax/10^5 ~ \Msun)^{0.28}$, respectively. The massive model
clouds follow the SFR-dense gas mass relation obtained by Gao \& Solomon for
infrared galaxies, extrapolated down to MCs scales. Low-mass clouds fall above
this relation, in agreement with recent observations. An integration of the
model-predicted $\SFRavg$ over a Galactic GMC mass spectrum yields a realistic
value for the Galactic SFR. Our results reinforce the suggestion that
star-forming GMCs may be in global collapse, and still have low net SFRs and
SFEs, due to the evaporation of most of the cloud material by the feedback from
massive stars.

For instance, these polynomials can exhibit a symmetry of type AS, which means
that they are anti-symmetric in the first $m$ variables and symmetric in the
remaining $N-m$ variables. One of our main goals is to extend recent works on
symmetric Jack polynomials [arXiv:0711.3062, arXiv:1007.2692, arXiv:1303.4126]
and prove that the Jack polynomials with prescribed symmetry also admit
clusters of size $k$ and order $r$, that is, the polynomials vanish to order
$r$ when $k+1$ variables coincide.
  We first prove some general properties for generic $\alpha$, such as their
uniqueness as triangular eigenfunctions of operators of Sutherland type, and
the existence of their analogues in infinity many variables. We then turn our
attention to the case with $\alpha=-(k+1)/(r-1)$. We show that for each triplet
$(k,r,N)$, there exist admissibility conditions on the indexing sets, called
superpartitions, that guaranty both the regularity and the uniqueness of the
polynomials. These conditions are also used to establish similar properties for
non-symmetric Jack polynomials. As a result, we prove that the Jack polynomials
with arbitrary prescribed symmetry, indexed by $(k,r,N)$-admissible
superpartitions, admit clusters of size $k=1$ and order $r\geq 2$. In the last
part of the article, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for the
invariance under translation of the Jack polynomials with prescribed symmetry

finite order elements and do explicit computations using the presentation to

the fractal-diffusive avalanche model of a slowly-driven self-organized

$\kappa \propto L^{0.94\pm0.01}$ and the 3-parameter scaling law $L \propto

with classical diffusion. The findings suggest long-range correlation lengths
in the FD-SOC system that operate in the vicinity of a critical state, which
could be used for predictions of individual extreme events. We find also that
eruptive flares (with accompanying CMEs), have larger volumes $V$, longer flare

however, turns out to be intricate and problematic, which --- as we show ---
can be overcome to some extent by a closer approximation of the intuitive human

specificity ordering over Poole's specificity relation in the classical
examples of the literature, we also report some hard mathematical facts:
Contrary to what was claimed before, we show that Poole's relation is not

however, show only a slight improvement over the known ones for Poole's
relation, and further work is needed in this aspect.

will have had some exposure to basic concepts in biology and chemistry.
NEXUS/Physics stresses interdisciplinary examples and the content differs
markedly from traditional introductory physics to facilitate this. It extends
the discussion of energy to include interatomic potentials and chemical
reactions, the discussion of thermodynamics to include enthalpy and Gibbs free
energy, and includes a serious discussion of random vs. coherent motion
including diffusion. The development of instructional materials is coordinated
with careful education research. Both the new content and the results of the
research are described in a series of papers for which this paper serves as an

simulation results and high-energy density laboratory experiments of the
Rayleigh-Taylor instability Kuranz et al. (2010).
  We adopt the Braginskii formulation for transport in hot, dense plasma,
implement and verify the additional physics modules, and conduct a
computational study of a single-mode RTI in two dimensions with various
combinations of the newly implemented modules.
  We find that magnetic fields reach levels on the order of 11 MG in the
absence of thermal conduction. We observe denting of the RT spike tip and
generation of additional higher order modes as a result of these fields.
Contrary to interpretation presented in earlier work Nishiguchi (2002), the
additional mode is not generated due to modified anisotropic heat transport
effects but due to dynamical effect of self-generated magnetic fields.
  The main effects of thermal conduction are a reduction of the RT instability
growth rate (by about 20% for conditions considered here) and inhibited mixing
on small scales. In this case, the maximum self-generated magnetic fields are
weaker (approximately 1.7 MG). These self-generated magnetic fields are of very
similar strength compared to magnetic fields observed recently in HED
laboratory experiments Manuel et al. (2012).
  We find that thermal conduction plays the dominant role in the evolution of
the model RTI system considered. It smears out small-scale structure and
reduces the RTI growth rate. This may account for the relatively featureless RT
spikes seen in experiments, but does not explain mass extensions observed in
experiments.
  Resistivity and related heat source terms were not included in the present
work, but we estimate their impact on RTI as modest and not affecting our main
conclusions. Resistive effects will be discussed in detail in the next paper in
the series.

On
the one hand, scans for positive selection have identified hundreds of
candidate loci and the genome-wide patterns of polymorphism show signatures
consistent with frequent positive selection. On the other hand, recent studies
have argued that many of the candidate loci are false positives and that most
apparent genome-wide signatures of adaptation are in fact due to reduction of
neutral diversity by linked recurrent deleterious mutations, known as
background selection. Here we analyze human polymorphism data from the 1,000
Genomes project (Abecasis et al. 2012) and detect signatures of pervasive
positive selection once we correct for the effects of background selection. We
show that levels of neutral polymorphism are lower near amino acid
substitutions, with the strongest reduction observed specifically near
functionally consequential amino acid substitutions. Furthermore, amino acid
substitutions are associated with signatures of recent adaptation that should
not be generated by background selection, such as the presence of unusually
long and frequent haplotypes and specific distortions in the site frequency
spectrum. We use forward simulations to show that the observed signatures
require a high rate of strongly adaptive substitutions in the vicinity of the
amino acid changes. We further demonstrate that the observed signatures of
positive selection correlate more strongly with the presence of regulatory
sequences, as predicted by ENCODE (Gerstein et al. 2012), than the positions of
amino acid substitutions. Our results establish that adaptation was frequent in
human evolution and provide support for the hypothesis of King and Wilson (King
and Wilson 1975) that adaptive divergence is primarily driven by regulatory
changes.

employing an holonomy correction imported from loop quantum cosmology, we
analyse the dynamics of the collapse within a semiclassical description. Using
a dynamical system approach, we find that the stable fixed points given by the
standard general relativistic setting turn into saddle points in the present
context. This provides a new dynamics in contrast to the black hole and naked
singularities solutions appearing in the classical model. Our results suggest
that classical singularities can be avoided by quantum gravity effects and are
replaced by a bounce. By a thorough numerical studies we show that, depending
on the barotropic parameter $\gamma$, there exists a class of solutions
corresponding to either a fluid or a tachyon dominated regimes. Furthermore,
for the case $\gamma \sim 1$, we find an interesting tracking behaviour between
the tachyon and the fluid leading to a dust-like collapse. In addition, we show
that, there exists a threshold scale which determines when an outward energy
flux emerges, as a non-singular black hole is forming, at the corresponding
collapse final stages.

binary radio pulsar discovered in the Parkes Multibeam survey. Radio timing
indicates that the pulsar has a circular orbit with a 15 hr orbital period, a
low-mass companion, and a measurable orbital period derivative. The eclipse
fraction of ~15% during the pulsar's orbit is twice the Roche lobe size
inferred for the companion. The timing behavior is significantly affected by
unmodeled systematics of astrophysical origin, and higher-order orbital period
derivatives are needed in the timing solution to account for these variations.
We have identified the pulsar's (non-degenerate) companion using archival
ultraviolet, optical, and infrared survey data and new optical photometry.
Doppler shifts from optical spectroscopy confirm the star's association with
the pulsar and indicate a pulsar-to-companion mass ratio of 3.3 +/- 0.5,
corresponding to a companion mass range of 0.4 to 0.7 Msun and an orbital
inclination angle range of between 30 and 41 degrees, assuming a pulsar mass
range of 1.4-2.0 Msun. Spectroscopy indicates a spectral type of G for the
companion and an inferred Roche-lobe-filling distance that is consistent with
the distance estimated from radio dispersion. The features of PSR J1723-2837
indicate that it is likely a ""redback"" system. Unlike the five other Galactic
redbacks discovered to date, PSR J1723-2837 has not been detected as a
gamma-ray source with Fermi. This may be due to an intrinsic spin-down
luminosity that is much smaller than the measured value if the unmeasured
contribution from proper motion is large.

inhomogeneous self-defocusing (SDF)\ onsite nonlinearity, whose strength
increases rapidly enough toward the lattice periphery, support stable
unstaggered (UnST) discrete bright solitons, which do not exist in lattices
with the spatially uniform SDF nonlinearity. The UnST solitons coexist with
stable staggered (ST) localized modes, which are always possible under the
defocusing onsite nonlinearity. The results are obtained in a numerical form,
and also by means of variational approximation (VA). In the semi-infinite
(truncated) system, some solutions for the UnST surface solitons are produced
in an exact form. On the contrary to surface discrete solitons in uniform
truncated lattices, the threshold value of the norm vanishes for the UnST
solitons in the present system. Stability regions for the novel UnST solitons
are identified. The same results imply the existence of ST discrete solitons in
lattices with the spatially growing self-focusing nonlinearity, where such
solitons cannot exist either if the nonlinearity is homogeneous. In addition, a
lattice with the uniform onsite SDF nonlinearity and exponentially decaying
inter-site coupling is introduced and briefly considered too. Via a similar
mechanism, it may also support UnST discrete solitons, under the action of the
SDF nonlinearity. The results may be realized in arrayed optical waveguides and
collisionally inhomogeneous Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in deep optical
lattices. A generalization for a two-dimensional system is briefly considered
too.

evolution of planetary systems can be computed for any form of tidal
dissipation, characterized by the imaginary part of the complex tidal Love
number, ${\rm Im}[{\tilde k}_2(\omega)]$, as a function of the forcing
frequency $\omega$. Using the simplest viscoelastic dissipation model (the
Maxwell model) for the rocky core and including the effect of a nondissipative
fluid envelope, we show that with reasonable (but uncertain) physical
parameters for the core (size, viscosity and shear modulus), tidal dissipation
in the core can accommodate the tidal-Q constraint of the Solar system gas
giants and at the same time allows exoplanetary hot Jupiters to form via tidal
circularization in the high-e migration scenario. By contrast, the often-used
weak friction theory of equilibrium tide would lead to a discrepancy between
the Solar system constraint and the amount of dissipation necessary for high-e
migration. We also show that tidal heating in the rocky core can lead to modest
radius inflation of the planets, particularly when the planets are in the
high-eccentricity phase ($e\sim 0.6$) during their high-e migration. Finally,
as an interesting by-product of our study, we note that for a generic tidal
response function ${\rm Im}[{\tilde k}_2(\omega)]$, it is possible that spin
equilibrium (zero torque) can be achieved for multiple spin frequencies (at a
given $e$), and the actual pseudo-synchronized spin rate depends on the

that interdependence does promote cooperation by means of organizational

we here address the question just how much interdependence there should be.
Intuitively, one might assume the more the better. However, we show that in
fact only an intermediate density of sufficiently strong interactions between
networks warrants an optimal resolution of social dilemmas. This is due to an
intricate interplay between the heterogeneity that causes an asymmetric
strategy flow because of the additional links between the networks, and the
independent formation of cooperative patterns on each individual network.
Presented results are robust to variations of the strategy updating rule, the
topology of interdependent networks, and the governing social dilemma, thus
suggesting a high degree of universality.

both the normalization and the slope of the observed trend of wind velocity

feedback exhibit qualitatively different properties compared to SN driven
winds, where most of the acceleration happens violently in situ near star
forming sites. In contrast, the CR-driven winds are accelerated gently by the
large-scale pressure gradient established by CRs diffusing from the
star-forming galaxy disk out into the halo. The CR-driven winds also exhibit
much cooler temperatures and, in the SMC-sized system, warm (T~10^4 K) gas

such as Na and O, in globular clusters (GCs) are interpreted as the effect of
internal pollution resulting from the presence of multiple stellar populations.
To better constrain this scenario we investigate the abundance distribution of
the heavy element rubidium (Rb) in NGC 6752, NGC 1904, and NGC 104 (47 Tuc).
Combining the results from our sample with those in the literature, we found
that Rb exhibits no star-to-star variations, regardless the cluster
metallicity, with the possible intriguing, though very uncertain, exception of
the metal-rich bulge cluster NGC 6388. If no star-to-star variations will be
confirmed for all GCs, it implies that the stellar source of the proton-capture
element variations must not have produced significant amounts of Rb. This
element is observed to be enhanced at extremely high levels in
intermediate-mass AGB (IM-AGB) stars in the Magellanic Clouds (i.e., at a
metallicity similar to 47 Tuc and NGC 6388). This may present a challenge to
this popular candidate polluter, unless the mass range of the observed IM-AGB
stars does not participate in the formation of the second-generation stars in
GCs. A number of possible solutions are available to resolve this conundrum,
also given that the Magellanic Clouds observations are very uncertain and may
need to be revised. The fast rotating massive stars scenario would not face
this potential problem as the slow mechanical winds of these stars during their
main-sequence phase do not carry any Rb enhancements; however, these candidates
face even bigger issues such as the production of Li and the close
over-imposition with core-collapse supernova timescales. Observations of Sr,
Rb, and Zr in metal-rich clusters such as NGC 6388 and NGC 6441 are sorely
needed to clarify the situation.

yet known of their chemical composition. With the arrival of new transit
spectroscopy and direct imaging facilities, the question of molecular
detectability as a function of signal-to-noise (SNR), spectral resolving power
and type of planets has become critical. In this paper, we study the
detectability of key molecules in the atmospheres of a range of planet types,
and report on the minimum detectable abundances at fixed spectral resolving
power and SNR. The planet types considered - hot Jupiters, hot super-Earths,
warm Neptunes, temperate Jupiters and temperate super-Earths - cover most of
the exoplanets characterisable today or in the near future. We focus on key
atmospheric molecules, such as CH4, CO, CO2, NH3, H2O, C2H2, C2H6, HCN, H2S and
PH3. We use two methods to assess the detectability of these molecules: a
simple measurement of the deviation of the signal from the continuum, and an
estimate of the level of confidence of a detection through the use of the
likelihood ratio test over the whole spectrum (from 1 to 16$\mu m$). We find
that for most planetary cases, SNR=5 at resolution R=300 ($\lambda < 5\mu m$)
and R=30 ($\lambda > 5\mu m$) is enough to detect the very strongest spectral
features for the most abundant molecules, whereas an SNR comprised between 10
and 20 can reveal most molecules with abundances 10^-6 or lower, often at
multiple wavelengths. We test the robustness of our results by exploring
sensitivity to parameters such as vertical thermal profile, mean molecular
weight of the atmosphere and relative water abundances. We find that our main
conclusions remain valid except for the most extreme cases. Our analysis shows
that the detectability of key molecules in the atmospheres of a variety of
exoplanet cases is within realistic reach, even with low SNR and spectral
resolving power.

magnetic energy. This is supported by the fact that the magnetic fields
inferred from several observed properties of AXPs and SGRs are greater than -

\(A^2({\mathbb D})\) and on the Hardy space \(H^2({\mathbb D}).\) Then, several
conditions are provided for the algebra generated by a diagonal operator on a
Hilbert space to be localizing. Finally, a theorem is provided about the
existence of hyperinvariant subspaces for operators with a localizing subspace
of extended eigenoperators. This theorem extends and unifies some previously

in which the signal is sparse with respect to a highly coherent frame. We
consider the use of a monotone version of the fast iterative shrinkage-
thresholding algorithm (MFISTA) to solve the analysis sparse recovery problem.
Since the proximal operator in MFISTA does not have a closed-form solution for
the analysis model, it cannot be applied directly. Instead, we examine two
alternatives based on smoothing and decomposition transformations that relax
the original sparse recovery problem, and then implement MFISTA on the relaxed
formulation. We refer to these two methods as smoothing-based and
decomposition-based MFISTA. We analyze the convergence of both algorithms, and
establish that smoothing- based MFISTA converges more rapidly when applied to
general nonsmooth optimization problems. We then derive a performance bound on
the reconstruction error using these techniques. The bound proves that our
methods can recover a signal sparse in a redundant tight frame when the
measurement matrix satisfies a properly adapted restricted isometry property.
Numerical examples demonstrate the performance of our methods and show that
smoothing-based MFISTA converges faster than the decomposition-based
alternative in real applications, such as MRI image reconstruction.

on observations made with the VERITAS imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope
array. These observations were motivated by the discovery of a cluster of
>30GeV photons in the first year of Fermi-LAT observations. VER J0521+211 is
relatively bright at TeV energies, with a mean photon flux of 1.93 +/-
0.13_stat +/- 0.78_sys 10^-11 cm-2 s-1 above 0.2 TeV during the period of the
VERITAS observations. The source is strongly variable on a daily timescale
across all wavebands, from optical to TeV, with a peak flux corresponding to
~0.3 times the steady Crab Nebula flux at TeV energies. Follow-up observations
in the optical and X-ray bands classify the newly-discovered TeV source as a BL
Lac-type blazar with uncertain redshift, although recent measurements suggest
z=0.108. VER J0521+211 exhibits all the defining properties of blazars in
radio, optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray wavelengths.

cultural evolution in which neural network based agents evolve ideas for
actions through invention and imitation, we tested the hypothesis that human
creativity began with onset of the capacity for recursive recall. We compared
runs in which agents were limited to single-step actions to runs in which they
used recursive recall to chain simple actions into complex ones. Chaining
resulted in higher diversity, open-ended novelty, no ceiling on the mean
fitness of actions, and greater ability to make use of learning. Using a
computational model of portrait painting, we tested the hypothesis that the
explosion of creativity in the Middle/Upper Paleolithic was due to onset of
con-textual focus: the capacity to shift between associative and analytic
thought. This resulted in faster convergence on portraits that resembled the
sitter, employed painterly techniques, and were rated as preferable. We
conclude that recursive recall and contextual focus provide a computationally
plausible explanation of how humans evolved the means to transform this planet.

as good intervals, which are used to estimate the joint distribution of optimal
solutions through an interaction between the pool of good genetics, which are
the individuals with smaller fitness values. And the sampling probabilities for
good genetics are determined through an interaction between those estimated
good intervals. It is a cross validation mechanism which determines the
sampling probabilities for good intervals and genetics, and the resulted
probabilities are used to design crossover, mutation and other stochastic
operators with importance sampling method. As the selection of genetics and
intervals is not directly dependent on the values of fitness, the resulted
offsprings may avoid the trap of local optima. And a purely random EA is also
combined into the proposed algorithm to maintain the diversity of population.

hypothesis that defocusing attention results in divergent or associative

attention results in convergent or analytic thought, conducive to rule-based
operations. Creativity appears to involve both. It is widely believed that it
is possible to escape mental fixation by spontaneously and temporarily engaging
in a more associative mode of thought. The resulting insight (if found) may be
refined in a more analytic mode of thought. The questions addressed here are:
(1) how does the architecture of memory support these two modes of thought, and
(2) what is happening at the neural level when one shifts between them? Recent
advances in neuroscience shed light on this. Activated cell assemblies are
composed of multiple neural cliques, groups of neurons that respond
differentially to general or context-specific aspects of a situation. I refer
to neural cliques that would not be included in the assembly if one were in an
analytic mode, but would be if one were in an associative mode, as neurds. It
is posited that the shift to a more associative mode of thought is accomplished
by recruiting neurds that respond to abstract or atypical microfeatures of the
problem or task. Since memory is distributed and content-addressable, this
fosters the forging of associations to potentially relevant items previously
encoded in those neurons. Thus it is proposed that creative thought not by
searching a space of predefined alternatives and blindly tweaking those that
hold promise, but by evoking remotely associated items through the recruitment
of neurds in a distributed, content-addressable memory.

contribution results in a deviation of the dispersion curve for the fundamental
mode from the Damon-Eshbach law and a substantial linewidth broadening in a
large wave vector range. We show that the decrease in the spin wave frequency
is due to an increase in the in-plane component of the dynamic magnetic field
within the conducting film. The decrease in the frequency is accompanied by a
drastic change in the asymmetry of the modal profiles for the waves. This
effect is not observable in magneto-insulating films and therefore it is
unambiguously attributed to eddy currents that appear in conducting films only.
We also show that the wave vector range in which eddy currents affect the
dispersion curve is strongly correlated with the value of the film

speaking, we consider both as linear time-invariant systems by appropriately

coding. This gives a novel way of converting an arbitrary relay network to an
equivalent acyclic single-hop relay network, which we call Network
Linearization. Based on network linearization, we prove that the fundamental
design limit, mincut, is achievable by a linear time-invariant network-coding
scheme regardless of the network topology.
  Then, we use the network-coding to view decentralized linear systems. We
argue that linear time-invariant controllers in a decentralized linear system
""communicate"" via linear network coding to stabilize the plant. To justify this
argument, we give an algorithm to ""externalize"" the implicit communication
between the controllers that we believe must be occurring to stabilize the
plant. Based on this, we show that the stabilizability condition for
decentralized linear systems comes from an underlying communication limit,

re-interpretation in hand, we also consider stabilizability over LTI networks

spatial position of remembered stimuli. Networks that support bump attractors
are often used to model such persistent activity. Such models usually exhibit
translational symmetry. Thus activity bumps are neutrally stable, and
perturbations in position do not decay away. We extend previous work on bump
attractors by constructing model networks capable of encoding the certainty or
salience of a stimulus stored in memory. Such networks support bumps that are
not only neutrally stable to perturbations in position, but also perturbations
in amplitude. Possible bump solutions then lie on a two-dimensional attractor,
determined by a continuum of positions and amplitudes. Such an attractor
requires precisely balancing the strength of recurrent synaptic connections.
The amplitude of activity bumps represents certainty, and is determined by the
initial input to the system. Moreover, bumps with larger amplitudes are more
robust to noise, and over time provide a more faithful representation of the
stored stimulus. In networks with separate excitatory and inhibitory
populations, generating bumps with a continuum of possible amplitudes, requires
tuning the strength of inhibition to precisely cancel background excitation.

intolerably large latency and packet loss could be induced, if the source

interruption was accompanied by triggering of a movement of the axis of the

displacements as in Levy flights, scale-free waiting times as in subdiffusive
CTRWs, and the long-range temporal correlations of fractional Brownian motion
(FBM). We derive the exact solutions for the single-time probability density
functions and extract the scaling behaviours. Interestingly, we find that
different combinations of the model parameters lead to indistinguishable shapes
of the emerging probability density functions and identical scaling laws. Our
model will be useful to describe recent experimental single particle tracking

the solar limb, and so differences in locations of the various emissions are
consistent with differences in heights above the photosphere of the various
emission sources. Under this interpretation, our observations are consistent
with the white-light emissions occurring at the lowest levels of where the Ca
II H emission occurs. Moreover, the centers of the source regions of the red,
green, and blue wavelengths of the white-light emissions are significantly
displaced from each other, suggesting that those respective emissions are
emanating from progressively lower heights in the solar atmosphere. The
temperature distribution was also calculated from the white-light data, and we
found the lower-layer emission to have a higher temperature. This indicates
that high-energy particles penetrated down to near the photosphere, and
deposited heat into the ambient lower layers of the atmosphere.

located mostly in the low Galactic latitude region and with a kinematics
similar to disk stars. After checking their images in Ha and other bands, three
of them are probably HII regions, one is probably associated with a new

she has to open up to three drawers, quantally just one. The fundamental reason
for this quantum speedup is not known. The usual representation of the quantum
algorithm is limited to the process of solving the problem. We extend it to the
process of setting the problem. The number of the drawer with the ball becomes
a unitary transformation of the random outcome of the preparation measurement.
This extended, time-symmetric, representation brings in relational quantum
mechanics. It is with respect to Bob and any external observer and cannot be
with respect to Alice. It would tell her the number of the drawer with the ball
before she opens any drawer. To Alice, the projection of the quantum state due
to the preparation measurement should be retarded at the end of her search; in
the input state of the search, the drawer number is determined to Bob and
undetermined to Alice. We show that, mathematically, one can ascribe any part
of the selection of the random outcome of the preparation measurement to the
final Alice's measurement. Ascribing half of it explains the speedup of the
present algorithm. This projects the input state to Alice on a state of lower
entropy where she knows half of the number of the drawer with the ball in
advance. The quantum algorithm turns out to be a sum over histories in each of
which Alice knows in advance that the ball is in a pair of drawers and locates
it by opening one of the two. In the sample of quantum algorithms examined, the
part of the random outcome of the initial measurement selected by the final
measurement is one half or slightly above it. Conversely, given an oracle
problem, the assumption it is one half always corresponds to an existing

complexity to question the common assumption that evolution on static fitness

the popular NK model of rugged fitness landscapes is PLS-complete for K >= 2;
the reduction from Weighted 2SAT is a bijection on adaptive walks, so there are
NK fitness landscapes where every adaptive path from some vertices is of
exponential length. Alternatively -- under the standard complexity theoretic
assumption that there are problems in PLS not solvable in polynomial time --
this means that there are no evolutionary dynamics (known, or to be discovered,

fitness peak on all NK landscapes with K = 2. Applying results from the
analysis of simplex algorithms, I show that there exist single-peaked

in their potential role of guiding the formulation of a theory of quantum
gravity, it is crucial to distinguish between principles which are strongly
supported by empirical data - either directly or indirectly - and principles
which instead (merely) rely heavily on theoretical arguments for their
justification. These remarks are illustrated in terms of the current standard
models of cosmology and particle physics, as well as their respective
underlying theories, viz. general relativity and quantum (field) theory. It is
argued that if history is to be of any guidance, the best chance to obtain the
key structural features of a putative quantum gravity theory is by deducing
them, in some form, from the appropriate empirical principles (analogous to the
manner in which, say, the idea that gravitation is a curved spacetime
phenomenon is arguably implied by the equivalence principle). It is
subsequently argued that the appropriate empirical principles for quantum
gravity should at least include (i) quantum nonlocality, (ii) irreducible
indeterminacy, (iii) the thermodynamic arrow of time, (iv) homogeneity and
isotropy of the observable universe on the largest scales. In each case, it is
explained - when appropriate - how the principle in question could be
implemented mathematically in a theory of quantum gravity, why it is considered
to be of fundamental significance and also why contemporary accounts of it are
insufficient.

record the time evolution of particle sizes. We study the heat transfer as a
function of the particle scale Reynolds number for three cases: fixed ice balls
melting in a region of strong turbulence with zero mean flow, fixed ice balls
melting under the action of a strong mean flow with lower fluctuations, and ice
balls freely advected in the whole flow. For the fixed particles cases, heat
transfer is observed to be much stronger than in laminar flows, the Nusselt
number behaving as a power law of the Reynolds number of exponent 0.8. For
freely advected ice balls, the turbulent transfer is further enhanced and the
Nusselt number is proportional to the Reynolds number. The surface heat flux is
then independent of the particles size, leading to an ultimate regime of heat
transfer reached when the thermal boundary layer is fully turbulent.

are build up through a sequence sticking collisions. The outcome of collisions
between porous dust aggregates is very important for the growth from very small

material properties of dust aggregates as a function the porosity.
  Aims: Continuum models such as SPH that are capable of simulating collisions
of macroscopic dust aggregates require a set of material parameters. Some of
them such as the tensile and shear strength are difficult to obtain from
laboratory experiments. The aim of this work is to determine these parameters
from ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations.
  Methods: We simulate the behavior of porous dust aggregates using a detailed
micro-physical model of the interaction of spherical grains that includes
adhesion forces, rolling, twisting, and sliding. Using different methods of
preparing the samples we study the strength behavior of our samples with
varying porosity and coordination number of the material.
  Results: For the tensile strength, we can reproduce data from laboratory
experiments very well. For the shear strength, there are no experimental data
available. The results from our simulations differ significantly from previous
theoretical models, which indicates that the latter might not be sufficient to
describe porous dust aggregates.
  Conclusions: We have provided functional behavior of tensile and shear
strength of porous dust aggregates as a function of the porosity that can be
directly applied in continuum simulations of these objects in planet formation
scenarios.

  Self-consistent fits to each source are obtained. We constrain the
characteristics of the molecular gas in the envelopes as well as in the
molecular outflows. We find that the molecular gas abundances in the infalling
envelope are reduced, presumably due to freeze-out, whilst the abundances in
the molecular outflows are enhanced, presumably due to dynamical activity.

of this system are a quasar and a submillimeter galaxy, separated by a
projected distance of about 24 kpc and characterized by very high SFR, higher
than 1000 Msun/yr. However, the ALMA observations reveal that these galaxies
apparently have undisturbed rotating disks, which is at variance with the
commonly accepted scenario in which strong star formation activity is induced
by a major merger. We also detected faint components which, after spectral
deblending, were spatially resolved from the main QSO and SMG emissions. The
relative velocities and positions of these components are compatible with
orbital motions within the gravitational potentials generated by the QSO host
galaxy and the SMG, suggesting that they are smaller galaxies in interaction or
gas clouds in accretion flows of tidal streams. We did not find any clear
spectral evidence for outflows caused by AGN or stellar feedback. This suggests
that the high star formation rates might be induced by interactions or minor
mergers with these companions, which do not affect the large-scale kinematics
of the disks, however. Our kinematical analysis also indicates that the QSO and
the SMG have similar Mdyn, mostly in the form of molecular gas, and that the
QSO host galaxy and the SMG are seen close to face-on with slightly different
disk inclinations: the QSO host galaxy is seen almost face-on (i~15), while the
SMG is seen at higher inclinations (i~25). Finally, the ratio between the black
hole mass of the QSO, obtained from XShooter spectroscopy, and the Mdyn of the
host galaxy is similar to value found in very massive local galaxies,
suggesting that the evolution of black hole galaxy relations is probably better
studied with dynamical than with stellar host galaxy masses.

injection. We show that there is a transition between nonrelativistic shocks,
where the acceleration efficiency can be extremely high and the nonlinear
compression ratio can be substantially greater than the Rankine-Hugoniot value,
and fully relativistic shocks, where diffusive shock acceleration is less
efficient and the compression ratio remains at the Rankine-Hugoniot value. This
transition occurs in the trans-relativistic regime and, for the particular
parameters we use, occurs around a shock Lorentz factor = 1.5. We also find
that nonlinear shock smoothing dramatically reduces the acceleration efficiency
presumed to occur with large-angle scattering in ultra-relativistic shocks. Our
ability to seamlessly treat the transition from ultra-relativistic to
trans-relativistic to nonrelativistic shocks may be important for evolving
relativistic systems, such as gamma-ray bursts and type Ibc supernovae. We
expect a substantial evolution of shock accelerated spectra during this

scales through the envelope towards the central protostar. The velocity profile
around protostars is poorly constrained. 6 Class 0 protostars and one Class I
protostars observed with HIFI on board Herschel as part of the ""Water in
star-forming regions with Herschel"" (WISH) survey show infall signatures in
water line observations. We use 1-D non-LTE RATRAN radiative transfer models of
the observed water lines to constrain the infall velocity and chemistry in the
protostellar envelopes of these sources. We assume a free-fall velocity profile
and, having found the best fit, vary the radii over which infall takes place.
In the well-studied Class 0 protostar NGC1333-IRAS4A we find that infall takes
place over the whole envelope to which our observations are sensitive (r>~1000
AU). For 4 sources infall takes place on core to envelope scales (i.e.
~10000-3000 AU). In 2 sources the inverse P-Cygni profiles seen in the
ground-state lines are more likely due to larger-scale motions or foreground
clouds. Models including a simple consideration of the chemistry are consistent
with the observations, while using step abundance profiles are not. The
non-detection of excited water in the inner envelope in 6/7 protostars is
further evidence that water must be heavily depleted from the gas-phase at
these radii. Infall in four of the sources is supersonic and infall in all
sources must take place at the outer edge of the envelope, which may be
evidence that collapse is global or outside-in rather than inside-out. The mass
infall rate in IRAS4A is large (>~10^-4 msol\yr), higher than the mass outflow
rate and expected mass accretion rates onto the star, suggesting that any
flattened disk-like structure on small scales will be gravitationally unstable,
potentially leading to rotational fragmentation and/or episodic accretion.

environment. Such behaviour in higher organisms can often be reduced to a few
stereotyped modes of movement due to physiological limitations, but finding
such modes in amoeboid cells is more difficult as they lack these constraints.
Here, we examine cell shape and movement in starved Dictyostelium amoebae
during migration toward a chemoattractant in a microfluidic chamber. We show
that the incredible variety in amoeboid shape across a population can be
reduced to a few modes of variation. Interestingly, cells use distinct modes
depending on the applied chemical gradient, with specific cell shapes
associated with shallow, difficult-to-sense gradients. Modelling and drug
treatment reveals that these behaviours are intrinsically linked with accurate
sensing at the physical limit. Since similar behaviours are observed in a
diverse range of cell types, we propose that cell shape and behaviour are

improvement by adding J band data within the statistical scatter. We also

Although the number density of total H alpha emitters having higher H alpha
fluxes than the FMOS sensitivity is comparable with the FMOS fiber density, the
limited accuracy of photometric redshift and H alpha flux estimations have
comparable effects on the success rate of <~20% obtained from SED fitting.

receive both resonant and nonresonant contributions. Dominant nonresonant
contributions to tree-dominated three-body decays arise from the $b\to u$ tree
transition which can be evaluated using heavy meson chiral perturbation theory
valid in the soft meson limit. For penguin-dominated decays, nonresonant
signals come mainly from the penguin amplitude governed by the matrix elements
of scalar densities $<M_1M_2|\bar q_1 q_2|0>$. We use the measurements of $\bar
B^0\to K_SK_SK_S$ to constrain the nonresonant component of $<K\bar K|\bar

identified through the vector current, while the scalar meson resonances are
mainly associated with the scalar density. While the calculated direct CP
violation in $B^-\to K^+K^-K^-$ and $B^-\to \pi^+\pi^-\pi^-$ decays agrees well
with experiment in both magnitude and sign, the predicted CP asymmetries in

resolution to this CP puzzle may rely on final-state rescattering of
$\pi^+\pi^-$ and $K^+K^-$. Assuming a large strong phase associated with the
matrix element $<K\pi|\bar sq|0>$ arising from some sort of power corrections,

optimal magnetic ion-quantum dot systems for implementation of a single-ion

~2Myr-old fully-convective 0.65+-0.05 Msun star with a radius of 1.9+-0.2 Dsun,
viewed at an inclination of 35+-10degr.
  Clear circularly-polarized Zeeman signatures are detected in both
photospheric and accretion-powered emission lines, probing longitudinal fields
of up to 1.8 kG (in the He1 D3 accretion proxy). Rotational modulation of
Zeeman signatures, detected both in photospheric and accretion lines, is
different between our 2 runs, providing further evidence that fields of cTTSs
are generated by non-stationary dynamos.
  Using tomographic imaging, we reconstruct maps of the large-scale field, of
the photospheric brightness and of the accretion-powered emission at the
surface of DN Tau at both epochs. We find that the magnetic topology is mostly
poloidal, and largely axisymmetric, with an octupolar component (of polar
strength 0.6-0.8 kG) 1.5-2.0x larger than the dipolar component (of polar
strength 0.3-0.5 kG).
  DN Tau features dominantly poleward accretion at both epochs. The large-scale
dipole component of DN Tau is however too weak to disrupt the surrounding
accretion disc further than 65-90% of the corotation radius (at which the disc
Keplerian period matches the stellar rotation period), suggesting that DN Tau
is already spinning up despite being fully convective.

different type of random projection than those analyzed in the low-rank

leading order Born diagrams. Our results show clearly the effect of a finite
parton mass and width on the perturbative elastic $(q(g) Q \rightarrow q (g)

the invariant energy $\sqrt{s}$ and the scattering angle $\theta$. Our detailed
comparisons demonstrate that the finite width of the quasi-particles in the

the cross section for $q Q \rightarrow q Q$ as well as $g Q \rightarrow g Q$
scattering except close to thresholds. Thus when studying the dynamics of
energetic heavy quarks in a QGP medium the spectral width of the
degrees-of-freedom may be discarded. We have, furthermore, compared the cross
sections from the DQPM with corresponding results from hard-thermal-loop (HTL)
approaches. The HTL inspired models - essentially fixing the regulators by
elementary vacuum cross sections and decay amplitudes instead of properties of
the QGP at finite temperature - provide quite different results especially
w.r.t. the temperature dependence of the $qQ$ and $gQ$ cross sections (in all

underutilization of those already allocated, the concept of Cognitive Radio
(CR) has emerged. Opportunistic users could exploit temporarily vacant bands
after detecting the absence of activity of their owners. One of the crucial
tasks in the CR cycle is therefore spectrum sensing and detection which has to
be precise and efficient. Yet, CRs typically deal with wideband signals whose
Nyquist rates are very high. In this paper, we propose to reconstruct the power
spectrum of such signals from sub-Nyquist samples, rather than the signal
itself as done in previous work, in order to perform detection. We consider
both sparse and non sparse signals as well as blind and non blind detection in
the sparse case. For each one of those scenarii, we derive the minimal sampling
rate allowing perfect reconstruction of the signal's power spectrum in a
noise-free environment and provide power spectrum recovery techniques that
achieve those rates. The analysis is performed for two different signal models
considered in the literature, which we refer to as the analog and digital
models, and shows that both lead to similar results. Simulations demonstrate
power spectrum recovery at the minimal rate in noise-free settings and show the
impact of several parameters on the detector performance, including
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), sensing time and sampling rate.

objects like the Orion Trapezium. In the turbulent core accretion model, the
resulting stellar masses are directly related to the mass distribution of the
cloud condensations. In the competitive accretion model, the gravitational
potential of the protocluster captures gas from the surrounding cloud for which
the individual cluster members compete. [Aims] With high resolution
submillimeter observations of the structure, kinematics, and chemistry of the

formation dominates. [Methods] We present 354 GHz Submillimeter Array
observations at resolutions of 1""-3"" (1800-5400 AU) of W3 IRS5. ......
[Results] The observations show five emission peaks (SMM1-5). SMM1 and SMM2
contain massive embedded stars (~20 Msun); SMM3-5 are starless or contain
low-mass stars (<8 Msun). The inferred densities are high, >= 10^7 cm^-3, but
the core masses are small, 0.2-0.6 Msun. The detected molecular emission
reveals four different chemical zones. ...... [Conclusions] The proto-Trapezium
cluster W3 IRS5 is an ideal test case to discriminate between models of massive
star formation. Either the massive stars accrete locally from their local
cores; in this case the small core masses imply that W3 IRS5 is at the very end
stages (1000 yr) of infall and accretion, or the stars are accreting from the
global collapse of a massive, cluster forming core. We find that the observed
masses, densities and line widths observed toward W3 IRS 5 and the surrounding
cluster forming core are consistent with the competitive accretion of gas at
rates of Macc~10^-4 Msun yr^-1 by the massive young forming stars. ......

arriving at substantially different estimates due to differences in their
assumptions about the velocities at the present epoch. In an effort to locate
the largest bound structures in the universe, we selected the Aquarius (ASC),
Microscopium (MSC), Corona Borealis (CBSC), and Shapley (SSC) superclusters for
study, due to their high number density of rich Abell clusters. Simple N-body
simulations, which assumed negligible intercluster mass, were used to assess
the likelihood of these structures being gravitationally bound, and the
predictions of the models of B03 and D06 were compared with those results. We
find that ASC, and MSC contain pairs of clusters which are gravitationally
bound, A2541/A2546 and A3695/A3696 respectively, with no other structures
having a significant chance of being bound. For SSC, we find a group of five
clusters, A3554, A3556, A3558, A3560, and A3562 that are bound, with an
additional pair, A1736/A3559, having a slight chance of being bound. We find
that CBSC has no extended bound structure, contrary to the findings of Small et
al. 1998, who claim that the entire supercluster is bound. In regards to the
analytical models, we find that B03 will identify structure that is definitely
bound, but tends to underestimate the true extent of the structure, while D06
will identify all structure that is bound while overestimating its extent.
Combined, the two models can provide lower and upper limits to the extent of
bound structures so long as there are no other significant structures nearby or
no significant dark matter exterior to the clusters.

extending several well-known models for protein aggregation, the time evolution
of aggregate concentrations containing $r$ proteins, denoted $c_r(t)$, can be
written in terms of generalized Smoluchowski kinetics. With this approach we
take into account all possible aggregation and fragmentation reactions
involving clusters of any size. Correspondingly, an aggregate of size x+y could
be formed by or break-up into two smaller constituent aggregates of sizes x and
y. The rates of each aggregation or fragmentation reaction, called kernels, are
specified in terms of the aggregate size, and we solve $c_r(t)$ for large
cluster sizes using numerical techniques. We show that by using Smoluchowski
kinetics many pathways to fibrillation are possible and quantities, such as the
aggregate length distribution at an arbitrary time, can be calculated. We show
that the predicted results of the model are in agreement with the experimental
observations.

massive particles in black hole spacetimes involve numerical evolution of the
metric perturbation equations in the time-domain, which is computationally very
costly. We present here a new strategy, based on a frequency-domain treatment
of the perturbation equations, which offers considerable computational saving.
The essential ingredients of our method are (i) a Fourier-harmonic
decomposition of the Lorenz-gauge metric perturbation equations and a numerical
solution of the resulting coupled set of ordinary equations with suitable
boundary conditions; (ii) a generalized version of the method of extended
homogeneous solutions [Phys. Rev. D {\bf 78}, 084021 (2008)] used to circumvent
the Gibbs phenomenon that would otherwise hamper the convergence of the Fourier
mode-sum at the particle's location; and (iii) standard mode-sum
regularization, which finally yields the physical GSF as a sum over regularized
modal contributions. We present a working code that implements this strategy to
calculate the Lorenz-gauge GSF along eccentric geodesic orbits around a
Schwarzschild black hole. The code is far more efficient than existing
time-domain methods; the gain in computation speed (at a given precision) is
about an order of magnitude at an eccentricity of 0.2, and up to three orders
of magnitude for circular or nearly circular orbits. This increased efficiency
was crucial in enabling the recently reported calculation of the long-term
orbital evolution of an extreme mass ratio inspiral [Phys. Rev. D {\bf 85},
061501(R) (2012)]. Here we provide full technical details of our method to

original graph. It has a wide spectrum of applications, e.g. survey hidden
population in sociology [54], visualize social graph [29], scale down Internet
AS graph [27], graph sparsification [8], etc. In some scenarios, the whole
graph is known and the purpose of sampling is to obtain a smaller graph. In
other scenarios, the graph is unknown and sampling is regarded as a way to
explore the graph. Commonly used techniques are Vertex Sampling, Edge Sampling
and Traversal Based Sampling. We provide a taxonomy of different graph sampling
objectives and graph sampling approaches. The relations between these
approaches are formally argued and a general framework to bridge theoretical
analysis and practical implementation is provided. Although being smaller in
size, sampled graphs may be similar to original graphs in some way. We are
particularly interested in what graph properties are preserved given a sampling
procedure. If some properties are preserved, we can estimate them on the
sampled graphs, which gives a way to construct efficient estimators. If one
algorithm relies on the perserved properties, we can expect that it gives
similar output on original and sampled graphs. This leads to a systematic way
to accelerate a class of graph algorithms. In this survey, we discuss both
classical text-book type properties and some advanced properties. The landscape
is tabularized and we see a lot of missing works in this field. Some
theoretical studies are collected in this survey and simple extensions are
made. Most previous numerical evaluation works come in an ad hoc fashion, i.e.
evaluate different type of graphs, different set of properties, and different
sampling algorithms. A systematical and neutral evaluation is needed to shed
light on further graph sampling studies.

Earth, all of the following conditions must be met: (1) There must originally
have been a substantial quantity of uranium within Earth's core; (2) There must
be a natural mechanism for concentrating the uranium; (3) The isotopic
composition of the uranium at the onset of fission must be appropriate to
sustain a nuclear fission chain reaction; (4) The reactor must be able to breed
a sufficient quantity of fissile nuclides to permit operation over the lifetime

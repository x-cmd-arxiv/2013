through evaluation of orbital and layer resolved contributions into the total
anisotropy value. It is demonstrated that the origin of the large PMA values is
far beyond simply considering the hybridization between Fe-3d$ and O-2p
orbitals at the interface between the metal and the insulator. On-site
projected analysis show that the anisotropy energy is not localized at the
interface but it rather propagates into the bulk showing an attenuating
oscillatory behavior which depends on orbital character of contributing states
and interfacial conditions. Furthermore, it is found in most situations that
states with $d_{yz(xz)}$ and $d_{z^2}$ character tend always to maintain the
PMA while those with $d_{xy}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ character tend to favor the
in-plane anisotropy. It is also found that while MgO thickness has no influence
on PMA, the calculated perpendicular magnetic anisotropy oscillates as a
function of Fe thickness with a period of 2ML and reaches a maximum value of
3.6 mJ/m$^2$.

power spectrum from cosmic microwave background observations is a function of
various cosmological parameters, comparing individual parameters might be
misleading in the presence of cosmographic degeneracies. Another main result of
our analysis is the importance of the overall amplitudes of the observed

from 0.8 to 120 Msun with an initial metallicity Z = 0.002 with and without
rotation. We discuss the impact of a change in the metallicity by comparing the
current tracks with models computed with exactly the same physical ingredients
but with a metallicity Z = 0.014 (solar). We show that the width of the
main-sequence (MS) band in the upper part of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram
(HRD), for luminosity above log(L/Lsun) > 5.5, is very sensitive to rotational
mixing. Strong mixing significantly reduces the MS width. We confirm, but here
for the first time on the whole mass range, that surface enrichments are
stronger at low metallicity provided that comparisons are made for equivalent
initial mass, rotation and evolutionary stage. We show that the enhancement
factor due to a lowering of the metallicity (all other factors kept constant)
increases when the initial mass decreases. Present models predict an upper
luminosity for the red supergiants (RSG) of log (L/Lsun) around 5.5 at Z =
0.002 in agreement with the observed upper limit of RSG in the Small Magellanic
Cloud. We show that models using shear diffusion coefficient calibrated to
reproduce the surface enrichments observed for MS B-type stars at Z = 0.014 can
also reproduce the stronger enrichments observed at low metallicity. In the
framework of the present models, we discuss the factors governing the timescale
of the first crossing of the Hertzsprung gap after the MS phase. We show that
any process favouring a deep localisation of the H-burning shell (steep
gradient at the border of the H-burning convective core, low CNO content)
and/or the low opacity of the H-rich envelope favour a blue position in the HRD
for the whole or at least a significant fraction of the core He-burning phase.

statically-placed source and sink pairs that they can communicate with
wirelessly. We first analyze the capacity region for this problem under both
ideal (arbitrarily high velocity, long scheduling periods) and realistic
conditions. We indicate how robots could be scheduled optimally to satisfy any
arrival rate in the capacity region, given prior knowledge about arrival rates.
We find that if the number of robots allocated grows proportionally with the
number of source-sink pairs, then the capacity of the network scales as
$\Theta(1)$, similar to what was shown previously by Grossglauser and Tse for
uncontrolled mobility; however, in contrast to that prior result, we also find
that with controlled mobility this constant capacity scaling can be obtained
while ensuring finite delay. We then consider the setting where the arrival
rates are unknown and present a coarse-grained backpressure message ferrying
algorithm (CBMF) for it. In CBMF, the robots are matched to sources and sinks
once every epoch to maximize a queue-differential-based weight. The matching
controls both motion and transmission for each robot: if a robot is matched to
a source, it moves towards that source and collects data from it; and if it is
matched to a sink, it moves towards that sink and transmits data to it. We show
through analysis and simulations the conditions under which CBMF can stabilize
the network. We show that the maximum achievable stable throughput with this
policy tends to the ideal capacity as the schedule duration and robot velocity

joint spectrum of the masses squared, for fixed integer spin s and unspecified
parity and charge conjugation, obeys exactly the following laws: m_k^2 =
(k+s/2) Lambda_QCD^2 for s even, m_k^2 = 2(k+s/2) Lambda_QCD^2 for s odd, k =
1,2,... for glueballs, and m_n^2 = 1/2 (n+s/2) Lambda_QCD^2, n = 0,1,... for
mesons. One of the striking features of these laws is that they imply that the
glueball and meson masses squared form exactly-linear Regge trajectories in the
large-N limit of massless QCD, all the way down to the low-lying states: A fact
unsuspected so far. The numerical evidence is based on lattice computations by
Meyer-Teper in SU(8) YM for glueballs, and by Bali et al. in SU(17) quenched
massless QCD for mesons, that we analyze systematically. The aforementioned
spectrum for spin-0 glueballs is implied by a Topological Field Theory
underlying the large-N limit of YM, whose glueball propagators satisfy as well
fundamental universal constraints arising from the asymptotic freedom and the
renormalization group. No other presently existing model meets both the
infrared spectrum and the ultraviolet constraints. We argue that some features
of the aforementioned spectrum of glueballs and mesons of any spin could be
explained by the existence of a Topological String Theory dual to the
Topological Field Theory.

viewpoint is based on the philosophical theses advanced by Ludwig Boltzmann
(1844-1906) which states that scientific theories are nothing more than
representations, or images, of nature (arXiv:physics/0701308v1). By being
representations one cannot know how nature really is because the intrinsic and
indispensable properties that characterize nature are unreachable by science.
In other words, the true essences that constitute nature are unknowable.
Therefore, all answers proposed by science are partial, simplified and
replaceable. Another way of putting forward this viewpoint is to state that all
scientific truths are provisional, a result which naturally leads to the
conclusion that the same set of phenomena, or scientific questions, may have
various answers, or representations. This conclusion is generally known as
theoretical pluralism (arXiv:physics/9806011). It is exactly such a plurality
for conceiving, or representing, nature that opens the way for a possibly
fruitful dialog among the various forms of thinking, since this dialog can take
place in the realm of the representations. A few examples taken from cosmology,
sociology and theology are discussed in the context of this epistemological
framework.

extrasolar planets orbiting moderately bright (V=13.2, 12.8 and 11.9) stars.
The planets have orbital periods of 4.3012, 3.1290, and 4.4631 days, masses of
0.39, 0.89, and 0.49 Mjup, and radii of 1.28, 1.43, and 1.28 Rjup. The stellar
hosts have masses of 0.94, 1.26, and 1.28 Msun. Each system shows significant
systematic variations in its residual radial velocities indicating the possible
presence of additional components. Based on its Bayesian evidence, the
preferred model for HAT-P-44 consists of two planets, including the transiting
component, with the outer planet having a period of 220 d and a minimum mass of
1.6 Mjup. Due to aliasing we cannot rule out an alternative solution for the
outer planet having a period of 438 d and a minimum mass of 3.7 Mjup. For
HAT-P-45 at present there is not enough data to justify the additional free
parameters included in a multi-planet model, in this case a single-planet
solution is preferred, but the required jitter of 22.5 +- 6.3 m/s is relatively
high for a star of this type. For HAT-P-46 the preferred solution includes a
second planet having a period of 78 d and a minimum mass of 2.0 Mjup, however
the preference for this model over a single-planet model is not very strong.
While substantial uncertainties remain as to the presence and/or properties of
the outer planetary companions in these systems, the inner transiting planets
are well characterized with measured properties that are fairly robust against
changes in the assumed models for the outer planets. Continued RV monitoring is
necessary to fully characterize these three planetary systems, the properties
of which may have important implications for understanding the formation of hot
Jupiters.

  Results about the central sequence algebra are used to attack the conjecture

technique, is employed to determine geometrical structure parameters and
anisotropic dielectric properties of highly spatially coherent
three-dimensionally nanostructured thin films grown by glancing angle
deposition. The (piecewise) homogeneous biaxial layer model approach is
discussed, which can be universally applied to model the optical response of
sculptured thin films with different geometries and from diverse materials, and
structural parameters as well as effective optical properties of the
nanostructured thin films are obtained. Alternative model approaches for
slanted columnar thin films, anisotropic effective medium approximations based
on the Bruggeman formalism, are presented, which deliver results comparable to
the homogeneous biaxial layer approach and in addition provide film constituent
volume fraction parameters as well as depolarization or shape factors.
Advantages of these ellipsometry models are discussed on the example of metal
slanted columnar thin films, which have been conformally coated with a thin
passivating oxide layer by atomic layer deposition. Furthermore, the
application of an effective medium approximation approach to in-situ growth
monitoring of this anisotropic thin film functionalization process is

business networks, social networks, etc. as important research areas in

remain around their design and the partner selection rules while learning from
interaction events.While smart business networks should provide advantages due
to the quick connect of business partners for selected functions in a process
common to several parties, literature does not provide constructive methods
whereby the selection of temporary partners and functions can be done. Most
discussions only rely solely on human judgment. This paper introduces both
computational geometry, and genetic programming, as systematic methods whereby
to identify, characterize, and then display on a continuing basis from event
monitoring such possible partnerships; such techniques also allow to plan for
their effect on the organizations and thus to carry out selection. The two
methods are being put in the context of emergence theory. Tessellations address
the identification and categorization issues; business maps address the display

mimicking living bodies, with genetic algorithms of which parameters are
estimated by learning, address the selection and effect issues. To illustrate
the approach, some experimental results from the sourcing function in a high

via path integral. In order for a path integral to be at least formally
equivalent to the corresponding canonical quantization, at each point in the
space of histories it is important that the integrand have not only the correct
phase -- a topic of recent focus in spin-foams -- but also the correct modulus,
usually referred to as the measure factor. The correct measure factor descends
from the Liouville measure on the reduced phase space, and its calculation is a
task of canonical analysis.
  The covariant formulation of gravity from which spin-foams are derived is the
Plebanski-Holst formulation, in which the basic variables are a Lorentz
connection and a Lorentz-algebra valued two-form, called the Plebanski
two-form. However, in the final spin-foam sum, one sums over only spins and
intertwiners, which label eigenstates of the Plebanski two-form alone. The
spin-foam sum is therefore a discretized version of a Plebanski-Holst path
integral in which only the Plebanski two-form appears, and in which the
connection degrees of freedom have been integrated out. We call this a purely
geometric Plebanski-Holst path integral.
  In prior work in which one of the authors was involved, the measure factor
for the Plebanski-Holst path integral with both connection and two-form
variables was calculated. Before one discretizes this measure and incorporates
it into a spin-foam sum, however, one must integrate out the connection in
order to obtain the purely geometric version of the path integral. To calculate
this purely geometric path integral is the principal task of the present paper,
and it is done in two independent ways. Gauge-fixing and the background
independence of the resulting path integral are discussed in the appendices.

folding reduces the chaoticity of the nonlinear dynamical system, and a folded

connection between the ILDM stability and the thermodynamic stability, which
enables us to quantify the disorderliness and relative energies of folded,

representative of prediction tasks in machine learning that require deducing a
latent structure from observed patterns of activity in a network, which often
require an unrealistically large number of resources (e.g., amount of available
data, or computational time). A fundamental question is to understand which
properties we can predict with a reasonable degree of accuracy with the
available resources, and which we cannot. We define the trace complexity as the
number of distinct traces required to achieve high fidelity in reconstructing
the topology of the unobserved network or, more generally, some of its
properties. We give algorithms that are competitive with, while being simpler
and more efficient than, existing network inference approaches. Moreover, we
prove that our algorithms are nearly optimal, by proving an
information-theoretic lower bound on the number of traces that an optimal
inference algorithm requires for performing this task in the general case.
Given these strong lower bounds, we turn our attention to special cases, such
as trees and bounded-degree graphs, and to property recovery tasks, such as
reconstructing the degree distribution without inferring the network. We show
that these problems require a much smaller (and more realistic) number of

waveforms distinct from those generated by circularly merging binaries.
Dynamical environments can assemble binaries with high eccentricity and peak
frequencies within the {\it LIGO} band. In this paper, we study binary-single
stellar scatterings occurring in dense stellar systems as a source of
eccentrically-inspiraling binaries. Many interactions between compact binaries
and single objects are characterized by chaotic resonances in which the
binary-single system undergoes many exchanges before reaching a final state.
During these chaotic resonances, a pair of objects has a non-negligible
probability of experiencing a very close passage. Significant orbital energy
and angular momentum are carried away from the system by gravitational wave
(GW) radiation in these close passages and in some cases this implies an
inspiral time shorter than the orbital period of the bound third body. We
derive the cross section for such dynamical inspiral outcomes through
analytical arguments and through numerical scattering experiments including GW
losses. We show that the cross section for dynamical inspirals grows with
increasing target binary semi-major axis, $a$, and that for equal-mass binaries
it scales as $a^{2/7}$. Thus, we expect wide target binaries to predominantly
contribute to the production of these relativistic outcomes. We estimate that
eccentric inspirals account for approximately one percent of dynamically
assembled non-eccentric merging binaries. While these events are rare, we show
that binary-single scatterings are a more effective formation channel than

of protoplanetary disks. A certain class of disks, called transition disks,
exhibit cavities in dust images at scales of up to a few 10s of AU. The
formation mechanism of the cavities is still unclear. The gas content of such
cavities can be spatially resolved for the first time using the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA).
  We have developed a new series of models to simulate the physical conditions
and chemical abundances of the gas in cavities to address the question whether
the gas is primarily atomic or molecular inside the dust free cavities exposed
to intense UV radiation. Molecular/atomic line emission by carbon monoxide
(CO), its isotopologues (13CO, C18O, C17O, and 13C18O) and related species
([CI], [CII], and [OI]) is predicted for comparison with ALMA and the Herschel
Space Observatory.
  The gas can remain in molecular form down to very low amounts of gas in the
cavity. Shielding of the stellar radiation by a dusty inner disk
(pre-transition disk) allows CO to survive down to lower gas masses in the
cavity. The main parameter for the CO emission from cavity is the gas mass.
Other parameters such as the outer disk mass, bolometric luminosity, shape of
the stellar spectrum or PAH abundance are less important. Since the CO pure
rotational lines readily become optically thick, the CO isotopologues need to
be observed in order to quantitatively determine the amount of gas in the
cavity.
  A wide range of gas masses in the cavity of transition disks (~4 orders of
magnitude) can be probed using combined observations of CO isotopologue lines
with ALMA. Measuring the gas mass in the cavity will ultimately help to
distinguish between different cavity formation theories.

melting and crystallization of chondrules found in chondritic meteorites.
Theoretical models of chondrule melting in nebular shocks has been shown to be
consistent with many aspects of thermal histories inferred for chondrules from
laboratory experiments; but, the mechanism driving these shocks is unknown.
Planetesimals and planetary embryos on eccentric orbits can produce bow shocks
as they move supersonically through the disk gas, and are one possible source
of chondrule-melting shocks. We investigate chondrule formation in bow shocks
around planetoids through 3D radiation hydrodynamics simulations. A new
radiation transport algorithm that combines elements of flux-limited diffusion
and Monte Carlo methods is used to capture the complexity of radiative
transport around bow shocks. An equation of state that includes the rotational,
vibrational, and dissociation modes of H$_2$ is also used. Solids are followed
directly in the simulations and their thermal histories are recorded. Adiabatic
expansion creates rapid cooling of the gas, and tail shocks behind the embryo
can cause secondary heating events. Radiative transport is efficient, and bow
shocks around planetoids can have luminosities $\sim$few$\times10^{-8}$
L$_{\odot}$. While barred and radial chondrule textures could be produced in
the radiative shocks explored here, porphyritic chondrules may only be possible
in the adiabatic limit. We present a series of predicted cooling curves that
merit investigation in laboratory experiments to determine whether the solids
produced by bow shocks are represented in the meteoritic record by chondrules

automata, showing that only certain growth rates (as a function of the number
$n$ of steps simulated) are possible. A classic result due to Ofman
(rediscovered and popularized by Ladner and Fischer) says that delay $O(\log
n)$ is always sufficient. We show that if the automaton is ""generalized
definite"", then delay O(1) is sufficient, but otherwise delay $\Omega(\log n)$
is necessary; there are no intermediate growth rates. We also consider
""physical"" (rather than ""logical"") delay, whereby we consider the lengths of

O(n) is clearly always sufficient. We show that if the automaton is ""definite"",

Burks, Goldstein and von Neumann concerning the average delay due to carry
propagation in ripple-carry adders, we derive conditions for the average
physical delay to be reduced from O(n) to $O(\log n)$, or to O(1), when the
inputs are independent and uniformly distributed random variables; again there

that star-forming galaxies grow proportionately as fast as their dark matter
halos while quiescent galaxies are outpaced by dark matter growth. At lower
masses, there is minimal difference in the SHMRs, implying that the majority
low-mass quiescent galaxies have only recently been quenched of their star
formation. Our analysis also affords a breakdown of all COSMOS galaxies into
the relative numbers of central and satellite galaxies for both populations. At
z=1, satellite galaxies dominate the red sequence below the knee in the stellar
mass function. But the number of quiescent satellites exhibits minimal redshift
evolution; all evolution in the red sequence is due to low-mass central
galaxies being quenched of their star formation. At M*~10^10 Msol, the fraction
of central galaxies on the red sequence increases by a factor of ten over our
redshift baseline, while the fraction of quenched satellite galaxies at that
mass is constant with redshift. We define a ""migration rate"" to the red
sequence as the time derivative of the passive galaxy abundances. We find that
the migration rate of central galaxies to the red sequence increases by nearly

violent merger of compact objects, such as neutron stars or black holes, which
makes them promising sources of gravitational waves. The detection of a
'kilonova'-like signature associated to the Swift-detected GRB 130603B has
suggested that this event is the result of a compact object merger. Our
knowledge on SGRB has been, until now, mostly based on the absence of supernova
signatures and the analysis of the host galaxies to which they cannot always be
securely associated. Further progress has been significantly hampered by the
faintness and rapid fading of their optical counterparts (afterglows), which
has so far precluded spectroscopy of such events. Afterglow spectroscopy is the
key tool to firmly determine the distance at which the burst was produced,
crucial to understand its physics, and study its local environment. Here we
present the first spectra of a prototypical SGRB afterglow in which both
absorption and emission features are clearly detected. Together with
multiwavelength photometry we study the host and environment of GRB 130603B.
From these spectra we determine the redshift of the burst to be z =
0.3565+/-0.0002, measure rich dynamics both in absorption and emission, and a
substantial line of sight extinction of A_V = 0.86+/-0.15 mag. The GRB was
located at the edge of a disrupted arm of a moderately star forming galaxy with
near-solar metallicity. Unlike for most long GRBs (LGRBs), N_HX / A_V is
consistent with the Galactic ratio, indicating that the explosion site differs
from those found in LGRBs. The merger is not associated with the most
star-forming region of the galaxy; however, it did occur in a dense region,
implying a rapid merger or a low natal kick velocity for the compact object
binary.

(45^+15_-13 per cent) galaxies in low-density environments (<0.77 Mpc^-2). We
find a weak but not significant relationship of the total star formation rates
of star-forming galaxies with environment. Due to the size of our sample and
the scatter observed we do not draw a definitive conclusion about a possible
SFR dependence on environment. Examining the spatial distribution of the Halpha
emission, we find no evidence for a change in shape or amplitude of the radial
profile of star-forming galaxies with environment. If these observations are
borne out in larger samples this would infer that any environment-driven
star-formation suppression must either act very rapidly (the
`infall-and-quench' model) or that galaxies must evolve in a density-dependent
manner (an `in-situ evolution' model).

objects suggest they harbour localized plasmas in their atmospheric
environments. For low-mass objects, the degree of thermal ionization is
insufficient to qualify the ionized component as a plasma, posing the question:
what ionization processes can efficiently produce the required plasma that is
the source of the radiation? We propose Alfv\'{e}n ionization as a mechanism
for producing localized pockets of ionized gas in the atmosphere, having
sufficient degrees of ionization ($\geq10^{-7}$) that they constitute plasmas.
We outline the criteria required for Alfv\'{e}n ionization and demonstrate it's
applicability in the atmospheres of low-mass objects such as giant gas planets,
brown dwarfs and M-dwarfs for both solar and sub-solar metallicities. We find
that Alfv\'{e}n ionization is most efficient at mid to low atmospheric
pressures where a seed plasma is easier to magnetize and the pressure gradients
needed to drive the required neutral flows are the smallest. For the model
atmospheres considered, our results show that degrees of ionization of
$10^{-6}-1$ can be obtained as a result of Alfv\'{e}n ionization. Observable
consequences include continuum Bremsstrahlung emission, superimposed with
spectral lines from the plasma ion species (e.g. He, Mg, H$_{2}$ or CO lines).
Forbidden lines are also expected from the metastable population. The presence
of an atmospheric plasma opens the door to a multitude of plasma and chemical
processes not yet considered in current atmospheric models. The occurrence of
Alfv\'{e}n ionization may also be applicable to other astrophysical
environments such as protoplanetary disks.

to be the associated entanglement of formation between A and a purifying third

the quantum discord. For classically correlated states and mixtures of a pure

observed three different behaviors: clusters close to the very pits out of

it is associated with a reduction of the radical production and an enhancement
of the erosion of the reactor walls. The dependence on the control parameters

examined. The underlying mechanism, governed by the secondary Bjerknes forces,
turns out to be strongly influenced by the nonlinearity of the bubble

production. Therefore, the increased number of bubbles at high power could be
the key to understand the experimental observation that, after a certain power

distance, the distance measured with VERA is marginal, 2.4^{+1.0}_{-0.6} kpc.
Using the distance, an absolute vertical motion (v_{b}) of -17.9 +/- 12.2 km
s^{-1} is determined with ~1.5-sigma significance. The tendency of the large
vertical motion is consistent with previous VLBI results for NGC 281 associated
with the same superbubble. Thus, our VLBI results indicate the superbubble
expansion motion whose origin is believed to be sequential supernova
explosions.

accreting millisecond pulsars, IGR J17480$-$2446 is peculiar in its low spin

star at the very early phase of mass transfer. However, this model seems to be
in contrast with the low field strength deduced from the kiloHertz

alternative interpretation, assuming that the current binary system was formed
during an exchange encounter either between a binary (which contains a recycled

reciprocity. Indirect reciprocity is a fundamental mechanism for the evolution
of cooperation. It relies on mutual monitoring and assessments, i.e.,
individuals judge, following their own assessment rules, whether other
individuals are ""good"" or ""bad"" according to information on their past
behaviors. Among many assessment rules, stern-judging is known to provide
stable cooperation in a population, as observed when all members in the
population know all about others' behaviors (public information case) and when
the members never commit an assessment error. In this paper, the effect of
assessment error and private information on stern-judging is investigated. By
analyzing the image matrix, which describes who is good in the eyes of whom in
the population, we analytically show that private information and assessment
error cause the collapse of stern-judging: all individuals assess other
individuals as ""good"" at random with a probability of 1/2.

several commonly used parameterizations of the exchange-correlation energy. The
generalized gradient approximation (GGA) reproduces the ground state properties
satisfactorily. Under pressure PaN is found to undergo a structural transition
from NaCl to the R-3m structure near 58 GPa. The high pressure behavior of the
acoustic phonon branch along the (1,0,0) and (1,1,0) directions, and the C44
elastic constant are anomalous, which signals the structural transition. With
GGA exchange-correlation, a topological transition in the charge density occurs
near the structural transition which may be regarded as a quantum phase
transition, where the order parameter obeys a mean field scaling law. However,
the topological transition is absent when other exchange-correlation
functionals are invoked (local density approximation (LDA) and hybrid
functional). Therefore, this constitutes an example of GGA and LDA leading to
qualitatively different predictions, and it is of great interest to examine
experimentally whether this topological transition occurs.

Single mode lasing (Gaussian beam) results in better reproducibility of

reproducibility was the same for both cases. Precision improvements were
attributed to more stable laser ablation due to better reproducibility of beam
profile fluence at laser spot. Plasma temperature and electron density were
higher for Gaussian laser beam. Calibration curves were obtained for four

different degrees of degradations. This motivates us to explore the use of
global variation of gradient based local quality map for overall image quality
prediction. We find that the pixel-wise gradient magnitude similarity (GMS)
between the reference and distorted images combined with a novel pooling
strategy the standard deviation of the GMS map can predict accurately

often measure signals whose phase is missing or has been irremediably
distorted. Phase retrieval attempts the recovery of the phase information of a
signal from the magnitude of its Fourier transform to enable the reconstruction
of the original signal. A fundamental question then is: ""Under which conditions
can we uniquely recover the signal of interest from its measured magnitudes?""
In this paper, we assume the measured signal to be sparse. This is a natural
assumption in many applications, such as X-ray crystallography, speckle imaging
and blind channel estimation. In this work, we derive a sufficient condition
for the uniqueness of the solution of the phase retrieval (PR) problem for both
discrete and continuous domains, and for one and multi-dimensional domains.
More precisely, we show that there is a strong connection between PR and the
turnpike problem, a classic combinatorial problem. We also prove that the
existence of collisions in the autocorrelation function of the signal may
preclude the uniqueness of the solution of PR. Then, assuming the absence of
collisions, we prove that the solution is almost surely unique on 1-dimensional
domains. Finally, we extend this result to multi-dimensional signals by solving
a set of 1-dimensional problems. We show that the solution of the
multi-dimensional problem is unique when the autocorrelation function has no
collisions, significantly improving upon a previously known result.

recent demonstrations of modulators, polarisation rotators, and isolators.
These promising yet preliminary results raise crucial questions: what is the
optimal performance achievable by more complex designs using multilayer
structures, graphene patterning, metal additions, or a combination of these
approaches, and how can this optimum design be achieved in practice? Today, the
complexity of the problem, which is magnified by the variability in graphene
parameters, leaves the design of these new devices to time-consuming and
suboptimal trial-and-error procedures. We address this issue by first
demonstrating that the relevant figures of merit for the devices above are
subject to absolute theoretical upper bounds. Strikingly these limits are
related only to the conductivity tensor of graphene; thus, we can provide
essential roadmap information such as the best possible device performance
versus wavelength and graphene quality. Second, based on the theory developed,
physical insight, and detailed simulations, we demonstrate how structures
closely approaching these fundamental limits can be designed, demonstrating the
possibility of significant improvement. These results are believed to be of
paramount importance for the design of graphene-based modulators, rotators, and
isolators and are also directly applicable to other 2-dimensional materials.

landscape parameters $x_u$ and $\Delta G^{\ddagger}$, extracted from
dependencies of unfolding forces on pulling speeds, are found to agree
reasonably well with experiments. We predict that above $v=10^4$ nm/s the
additional force-induced intermediate state is populated at an end-to-end
extension of about $75 \mathring{A}$. The force-induced switch in the unfolding
pathway occurs at the critical pulling speed $v_{crit} \approx 10^6-10^7$ nm/s.
We argue that this critical pulling speed is an upper limit of the interval
where Bell's theory works. However, our results suggest that the Go-model fails
to reproduce the experimentally observed mechanical unfolding pathway properly,
yielding an incomplete picture of the free energy landscape. Surprisingly, the
experimentally observed intermediate state with the A strand detached is not
populated in Go-model simulations over a wide range of pulling speeds. The
discrepancy between simulation and experiment is clearly seen from the early
stage of the unfolding process which shows the limitation of the Go model in
reproducing unfolding pathways and deciphering the complete picture of the free

understand Higgs sterility and its implications, says the amount of pushing-up
m_h\lesssim 5 GeV while the pulling-down scenario is favored. Stops can be
light here, so Higgs sterility significantly constrains them directly and
indirectly except for blind spots. We also study the LHC features of the whole

solutions whose horizon is planar. The first family of black holes obtained for
a particular value of the nonminimal coupling parameter only depends on a

corresponds to a two-parametric (with constants M and A) black hole stealth
configuration, that is a nontrivial scalar field with a black hole metric such
that both side (gravity and matter parts) of the Einstein equations vanishes.
In this case, in the vanishing M, the solution reduces to a stealth scalar
field on the pure AdS metric. We note that the existence of these two classes
of solutions is inherent of the particular choice of the coupling constants
and, they can not be promoted to spherical or hyperboloid black hole solutions
in a standard fashion. In the last part, we add to the original action some
exacts (D-1)-forms coupled to the scalar field. The direct benefit of
introducing such extra fields is to obtain black hole solutions with planar

gies rely on an eddy viscosity to model the unresolved turbulent fluctuations.
How- ever, the ratio of unresolved to resolved scales - very much like a degree
of rarefaction - is not taken into account by the popular conventional schemes,
based on the Navier- Stokes equations. This paper investigates the simulation
of turbulent flow with a gas- kinetic scheme. In so doing, the modeling of
turbulence becomes part of the numerical scheme: the degree of rarefaction is
automatically taken into account; the turbulent stress tensor is not
constrained into a linear relation with the strain rate. Instead it is modeled
on the basis of the analogy between particles and eddies, without any as-
sumptions on the type of turbulence or flow class. The implementation of a
turbulent gas-kinetic scheme into a finite-volume solver is put forward, with
turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation supplied by an allied turbulence
model. A number of flow cases, challenging for conventional RANS methods, are
investigated; results show that the shock-turbulent boundary layer is captured
in a much more convincing way by the gas-kinetic scheme.

containing many properties of the Higgses in the minimal supersymmetric
standard model (MSSM), especially in the neutral Higgs sector. One exact
relation in the MSSM, m^2_H^{+/-}=m^2_A+m^2_W, is still true in the SUSYE331.

decays of these Higgses as one of signatures of new physics in the SUSYE331

trace the U-shaped structure seen in the mid-infrared image. In contrast, the

two compact SiO clumps along the faint arc-like feature to the east of the

other is an extended component with lower velocities. The kinematic structure
at the B1 position is different from that expected in a single bow shock. It is
likely that the high-velocity SiO clump at the B1 position is kinetically

Because of the presence of rotation and accretion disks, classical T
Tauri stars have symmetry planes that are normally inclined relative to the
plane of the sky. The inclination angles affect the observed spectral
properties of these objects. AIMS. We study the influence of the inclination
angles on classical T Tauri star spectra in an empirical manner. METHODS.
Published inclination angles, derived from the stellar photospheric rotation or
from spatially resolved circumstellar disk observations, are compared with
various observed spectral properties, and correlations are established and
investigated. RESULTS. Inclinations derived from the stellar rotation are found
to be much less accurate than the published disk inclinations, and no
significant correlations between spectral properties and inclinations based on
rotation data could be detected. In contrast, significant correlations are
found between the disk inclination angles and the apparent velocities observed
for the forbidden emission lines and the wind absorption features of permitted
lines. These data support the assumption of cone-like polar winds with opening
angles smaller than $\approx 45^\circ$. Other spectral features show weaker or
no inclination dependence. Using these results, the true (deprojected) flow
velocities of the polar winds are derived for the investigated sample of T
Tauri stars. Deprojected wind-ejection velocities appear to differ by a factor
of two among the stars in our sample, which spans a range of mass-loss rates

decoupling of a qubit at an optimal working point. Considering a sequence of
$n$ pulses and pure dephasing due to quadratic coupling to Gaussian distributed
noise $\xi(t)$, I use the linked-cluster (cumulant) expansion to calculate the
coherence decay. Solutions allowing for reconstruction of spectral density of
noise are given. For noise with correlation time shorter than the timescale on
which coherence decays, the noise filtered by the dynamical decoupling
procedure can be treated as effectively Gaussian at large $n$, and
well-established methods of noise spectroscopy can be used to reconstruct the
spectrum of $\xi^{2}(t)$ noise. On the other hand, for noise of dominant
low-frequency character ($1/f^{\beta}$ noise with $\beta \! > \! 1$), an
infinite-order resummation of the cumulant expansion is necessary, and it leads
to an analytical formula for coherence decay having a power-law tail at long
times. In this case, the coherence at time $t$ depends both on spectral density
of $\xi(t)$ noise at $\omega \! = \! n\pi/t$, and on the effective
low-frequency cutoff of the noise spectrum, which is typically given by the
inverse of the data acquisition time. Simulations of decoherence due to purely
transverse noise show that the analytical formulas derived in this paper apply
in this often encountered case of an optimal working point, provided that the
number of pulses is not very large, and the longitudinal qubit splitting is
much larger than the transverse noise amplitude.

charged particle in the presence of a constant external magnetic field and
confined in a parabolic quantum well are studied. The focus has been on the
effects of a topological defect, of the form of conical disclination, with
regard to the thermodynamic properties of the system. We have obtained the
modifications to the traditional Landau-Fock-Darwin spectrum in the presence of
conical disclination. The effect of the conical kink on the degeneracy
structure of the energy levels is investigated. The canonical formalism is used
to compute various thermodynamic variables. The study shows an interplay
between magnetic field, temperature and the degree of conicity by setting two
scales for temperature corresponding to the frequency of the confining
potential and the cyclotron frequency of external magnetic field. The kink
parameter is found to affect the quantitative behaviour of the thermodynamic
quantities. It plays a crucial role in the competition between the external
magnetic field and temperature in fixing the values of the thermal response
functions. This study provides an important motivation for studying similar
systems, however with non trivial interactions in the presence of topological
defects.

coefficients for such bifacial nanomaterials and investigate the fundamental
role of higher-order electromagnetic multipoles on the bifaciality. We find
that two counter-propagating waves in the material must experience the same

resource, and if each species modifies the resource dynamics such that this
favors its competitor, they may stably coexist. This coexistence mechanism,
known as relative nonlinearity of competition, is well understood
theoretically, but less is known about its evolutionary properties and its
prevalence in real communities. We address this challenge by using adaptive
dynamics theory and individual-based simulations to compare community
stabilization and evolutionary stability of species that coexist by relative
nonlinearity. In our analysis, evolution operates on the species'
density-compensation strategies, and we consider a trade-off between population
growth rates at high and low resource availability. We confirm previous
findings that, irrespective of the particular model of density dependence,
there are many combinations of overcompensating and undercompensating
density-compensation strategies that allow stable coexistence by relative
nonlinearity. However, our analysis also shows that most of these strategy
combinations are not evolutionarily stable and will be outcompeted by an
intermediate density-compensation strategy. Only very specific trade-offs lead
to evolutionarily stable coexistence by relative nonlinearity. As we find no
reason why these particular trade-offs should be common in nature, we conclude
that the sympatric evolution and evolutionary stability of relative
nonlinearity, while possible in principle, seems rather unlikely. We speculate
that this may, at least in part, explain why empirical demonstrations of this
coexistence mechanism are rare, noting, however, that the difficulty to detect
relative nonlinearity in the field [...]

efficient cooling towards quantum degeneracy is facilitated by applying a

improved cooling properties for a ring versus a standing-wave geometry.
Distinct quantum correlations and cooling limits for bosons and fermions
demonstrate quantum statistical effects. In particular, in ring cavities the
photon-mediated long-range interaction favours momentum-space pairing of

Starting from the general behaviour of the Bethe-Salpeter solutions for light

softened Coulomb singularity at the origin and, at large interquark distances,
rises beyond bounds for massless quarks but approaches a non-positive finite

properties that play important roles in various fields of science. Recently,
skyrmions have been directly observed in chiral magnets. Here, we investigate
the effects of nonmagnetic impurities (structural point-like defects) on the
different initial states (random or helical states) and on the formation of the
skyrmion crystal in a discrete lattice. By using first-principle calculations
and Monte Carlo techniques, we have shown that even a small percentage of spin
vacancies present in the chiral magnetic thin film affects considerably the
skyrmion order. The main effects of impurities are somewhat similar to thermal
effects. The presence of these spin vacancies also induces the formation of
compact merons (bimerons) in both the helical and skyrmion states. We have also
investigated the effects of adjacent impurities producing only one hole (with
an almost circular shape) intentionally inserted into the plate (forming a
non-simply connected manifold) on the skyrmion crystal.

3-adic integers whose forward orbits under this action intersects the 3-adic
Cantor set infinitely many times. It has been shown that this set has Hausdorff

sets leads to study of intersections of multiplicative translates of Cantor
sets by powers of 2. More generally, this paper studies the structure of finite
intersections of general multiplicative translates of the 3-adic Cantor set by
integers 1 < M_1 < M_2 < ...< M_n. These sets are describable as sets of 3-adic
integers whose 3-adic expansions have one-sided symbolic dynamics given by a
finite automaton. As a consequence, the Hausdorff dimension of such a set is
always of the form log(\beta) for an algebraic integer \beta. This paper gives
a method to determine the automaton for given data (M_1, ..., M_n).
Experimental results indicate that the Hausdorff dimension of such sets depends
in a very complicated way on the integers M_1,...,M_n.

although the evolution pattern of the outburst followed the typical q-shaped
profile, an absence of `canonical' soft state and a weak presence of

energy cutoff, shows that the fold-energy increases monotonically in the hard

soft-intermediate state. We attempted to estimate the mass of the source based
on the evolution of Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO) frequencies during rising

correlation of photon index and QPO frequency. It is also observed that during
multiple ejections (observed as radio flares) the QPO frequencies are not
present in the power spectra which is followed by softening of the spectra
(disk flux increases or high energy flux decreases). These results are the
`possible' indication that the Comptonized corona, which could be responsible
for the generation of QPO and for the non-thermal Comptonized component of the

character of the OH feature (strength of the absorption relative to the
emission) correlates with that of the 9.7-um silicate feature, a measure of
obscuration in ULIRGs. Unambiguous evidence for molecular outflows, based on
the detection of OH absorption profiles with median velocities more blueshifted
than -50 km/sec, is seen in 26 (70%) of the 37 OH-detected targets, suggesting
a wide-angle (~145 degrees) outflow geometry. Conversely, unambiguous evidence
for molecular inflows, based on the detection of OH absorption profiles with
median velocities more redshifted than +50 km/sec, is seen in only 4 objects,
suggesting a planar or filamentary geometry for the inflowing gas. Terminal
outflow velocities of ~-1000 km/sec are measured in several objects, but median
outflow velocities are typically ~-200 km s^{-1}. While the outflow velocities
show no statistically significant dependence on the star formation rate, they
are distinctly more blueshifted among systems with large AGN fractions and
luminosities [log (L_AGN / L_sun) > 11.8 +/- 0.3]. The quasars in these systems
play a dominant role in driving the molecular outflows. In contrast, the most
AGN dominated systems, where OH is seen purely in emission, show relatively
modest OH line widths, despite their large AGN luminosities, perhaps indicating
that molecular outflows subside once the quasar has cleared a path through the
obscuring material.

black hole. The source is thought to be powered by radiatively inefficient
accretion of gas from its environment. This form of accretion is a standard
mode of energy supply for most galactic nuclei. X-ray measurements have already
resolved a tenuous hot gas component from which it can be fed. However, the
magnetization of the gas, a crucial parameter determining the structure of the
accretion flow, remains unknown. Strong magnetic fields can influence the
dynamics of the accretion, remove angular momentum from the infalling gas,
expel matter through relativistic jets and lead to the observed synchrotron
emission. Here we report multi-frequency measurements with several radio
telescopes of a newly discovered pulsar close to the Galactic Centre and show
that its unusually large Faraday rotation indicates a dynamically relevant
magnetic field near the black hole. If this field is accreted down to the event

larger than 6nm are spheroids. Spheroidal dust particles have a factor 1.5 - 3
larger absorption cross section in the far IR than spherical grains of the same
volume. Mass estimates derived from submillimeter observations that ignore this
effect are overestimated by the same amount. In the presence of a magnetic
field, spheroids may be partly aligned and polarise light. We find that
polarisation spectra help to determine the upper particle radius of the
otherwise rather unconstrained dust size distribution. Stochastically heated
small grains of graphite, silicates and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)
are included. We tabulate parameters for PAH emission bands in various
environments. They show a trend with the hardness of the radiation field that
can be explained by the ionisation state or hydrogenation coverage of the
molecules. For each dust component its relative weight is specified, so that
absolute element abundances are not direct input parameters. The model is
confronted with the average properties of the Milky Way, which seems to
represent dust in the solar neighbourhood. It is then applied to four specific
sight lines including the reflection nebula NGC2023. For these sight lines, we
present linear and circular spectro-polarimetric observations obtained with
FORS/VLT. Using prolate rather than oblate grains gives a better fit to
observed spectra; the axial ratio of the spheroids is typically two and aligned
silicates are the dominant contributor to the polarisation.

astronomical time series. The biphase is the phase of the bispectrum, which is
the Fourier domain equivalent of the three-point correlation function. The
bispectrum measures two key nonlinear properties of a time series -- its
reversability in time, and the symmetry about the mean of its flux distribution
-- for triplets of frequencies. Like other Fourier methods, it is especially
valuable for working with time series which contain large numbers of cycles at
the period of interest, but in which the signal-to-noise at a given frequency
is small in any individual cycle, either because of measurement errors, or
because of the contributions from signals at other frequencies. This has long
been the case for studies of X-ray binaries, but is increasingly becoming true
for stellar variability (both intrinsic and due to planetary transits) in the
Kepler era. We attempt in this paper also to present some simple examples to
give a more intuitive understanding of the meaning of the bispectrum to
readers, in order to help to understand where it may be applicable in
astronomy. In particular, we give illustrative examples of what biphases may be
shown by common astrophysical time series such as pulsars, eclipsers, stars in
the instability strip, and solar flares. We then discuss applications to the
biphase data for understanding the shapes of the quasi-periodic oscillations of
GRS 1915+105 and the coupling of the quasi-periodic oscillations to the
power-law noise in that system.

  Precisely, if we use single layer potentials for the representation of the

the tunneling conductance across the spin-filter material CoFe2O4 interfaced
with Au electrodes, a geometry which provides nearly perfect lattice matching
at the CoFe2O4/Au(001) interface. Using density functional theory calculations
we demonstrate that interface states play a decisive role in controlling the
transport spin polarization in this tunnel junction. For a realistic CoFe2O4
barrier thickness, we predict a tunneling spin polarization of about -60%. We
show that this value is lower than what is expected based solely on
considerations of the spin-polarized band structure of CoFe2O4, and therefore
that these interface states can play a detrimental role. We argue this is a

  2009, pp. 282-293",,,"cs.CY cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper gives an analytical method to determine the economic and indirect
implications of denial of service and distributed denial of service attacks. It
is based on time preference dynamics applied to the monetary mass for the
restoration of capabilities, on long term investments to rebuild capabilities,
and of the usability level of the capabilities after an attack. A simple
illustrative example is provided for a denial of service on a corporate data
centre. The needed data collection methodologies are categorized by classes of
targets. The use of the method is explained in the context of legal or policy
driven dissuasive, retaliation or compensation/ restoration actions. A concrete
set of deployment cases in mobile communications services is discussed. The
conclusion includes policy recommendations as well as information exchange
requirements.

distinction between observer and particle transformations. In this work, we
consider a model in which a coefficient in the Standard-Model Extension leads
to violations of rotation invariance in Newton's second law. The model
highlights the distinction between observer and particle transformations.

takes the view that by combining scarce information on the attackers business
models, with rational economic analysis of these business processes, one can
identify design rules for economic defense mechanisms which the target can
implement, often in a cheap way in addition to technical means. A short survey
of game theory in the security area, is followed by a real case of an Internet
casino. This leads to develop a model, applicable to this case and others,
which is presented first qualitatively then quantitatively. This allows
carrying out different analyses based on different equilibrium or termination
principles; the ones studied are reward break-even analysis, and Max-Min
analysis from game theory, for the target and the attackers. On that basis, a
number of specific economic and information led defense strategies are
identified which can be further studied using the model and specific
adaptations to other data or cases.

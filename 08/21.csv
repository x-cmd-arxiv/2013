reveal substantial inhomogeneity on a nanometer length scale. Analysis of the
structure of the gap seen in tunneling spectra by comparison with calculated
spectra for different superconducting order parameters (s-wave, d-wave, and
anisotropic s-wave) yields the best agreement for an order parameter with
anisotropic s-wave symmetry with an anisotropy of ~40%. The temperature
dependence of the superconducting gap observed in places with large and small
gap size indicates that it is indeed the superconducting transition temperature
which is inhomogeneous. The temperature dependence of the gap size is
substantially larger than would be expected from BCS theory. An analysis of the
local gap size in relation with the local chemical composition shows almost no
correlation with the local concentration of Se-/Te-atoms at the surface.

conserved fold for protein function, almost all evolutionary models neglect
site-site correlations that arise from physical interactions between
neighboring amino acid sites. This is mainly due to the difficulty in
formulating a computationally tractable model since rate matrices can no longer
be used. Here we introduce a general framework, based on factor graphs, for
constructing probabilistic models of protein evolution with site
interdependence. Conveniently, efficient approximate inference algorithms, like
Belief Propagation, can be used to calculate likelihoods for these models. We
fit an amino acid substitution model of this type that accounts for both
solvent accessibility and site-site correlations. Comparisons of the new model
with rate matrix models and a model accounting only for solvent accessibility
demonstrate that it better fits the sequence data. We also examine evolution
within a family of homohexameric enzymes and find that site-site correlations
between most contacting subunits contribute to a higher likelihood. In
addition, we show that the new substitution model has a similar mathematical
form to the one introduced in (Rodrigue et al. 2005), although with different
parameter interpretations and values. We also perform a statistical analysis of
the effects of amino acids at neighboring sites on substitution probabilities
and find a significant perturbation of most probabilities, further supporting
the significant role of site-site interactions in protein evolution and
motivating the development of new evolutionary models like the one described
here. Finally, we discuss possible extensions and applications of the new
substitution models.

parametric resonance (PR) mode. This model was used in the course of designing
and setting of such a screen in LPMC. The PR-based screen compares favorably
with conventional types of such machines, where the transverse oscillations are
excited directly. It is characterized by larger values of the amplitude and by
insensitivity to damping in a rather wide range. The model represents an
initially strained system of two equal masses connected by a linearly elastic
string. Self-equilibrated, longitudinal, harmonic forces act on the masses.
Under certain conditions this results in transverse, finite-amplitude
oscillations of the string. The problem is reduced to a system of two ordinary
differential equations coupled by the geometric nonlinearity. Damping in both
the transverse and longitudinal oscillations is taken into account. Free and
forced oscillations of this mass-string system are examined analytically and
numerically. The energy exchange between the longitudinal and transverse modes
of free oscillations is demonstrated. An exact analytical solution is found for
the forced oscillations, where the coupling plays the role of a stabilizer. In
a more general case, the harmonic analysis is used with neglect of the higher
harmonics. Explicit expressions for all parameters of the steady nonlinear
oscillations are determined. The domains are found where the analytically
obtained steady oscillation regimes are stable. Over the frequency ranges,
where the steady oscillations exist, a perfect correspondence is found between
the amplitudes obtained analytically and numerically. Illustrations based on
the analytical and numerical simulations are presented.

structure of this disk using radiative transfer calculations to model the
spectral energy distribution (SED), continuum visibilities, and spectral line
emission of CO and its main isotopologues. Our modeling scheme demonstrates
that the majority of the dust mass is distributed in a narrow ring (centered at
37 AU with a FWHM of 16 AU) that is ~5 times more compact than the gas disk.
This structure implies that the dust-to-gas mass ratio has a strong spatial
variation, ranging from a value much larger than typical of the interstellar

radii. We suggest that these basic structural features are potentially
observational signatures of the accumulation of solids at a local gas pressure

the result of dynamical interactions with a low-mass companion, although

undergraduate science and engineering students in the Spring of 2013. The
course, meant for freshmen, attempts to integrate statistical mechanics into
non-classical physics and introduces some novel teaching ideas such as the
field approach in contrast to typical wave and particle viewpoints
traditionally covered in usual textbooks. The various modern applications of
quantum theory in realizing practical devices are recounted in a way that is
amenable to beginners. Especially, we describe the inclusion of visually
appealing and carefully designed robust experiments inside the formal classroom
environment. This collection of applications and demonstrations serves as a
useful collection of teaching aids and can be easily transformed into active
learning exercises. The impact of this teaching strategy on student learning
and its role in exciting an interest in physics is assessed.

extreme member of the class of Pre-Planetary Nebulae, objects which represent a
short-lived transitional phase between the AGB and Planetary Nebula
evolutionary stages. Previous single-dish CO (J=1-0) observations (with a 45
arcsec beam) showed that the high-speed outflow in this object has cooled to a
temperature significantly below the temperature of the cosmic background
radiation. Here we report the first observations of the Boomerang with ALMA in
the CO J=2-1 and J=1-0 lines to resolve the structure of this ultra-cold
nebula. We find a central hourglass-shaped nebula surrounded by a patchy, but
roughly round, cold high-velocity outflow. We compare the ALMA data with
visible-light images obtained with HST and confirm that the limb-brightened
bipolar lobes seen in these data represent hollow cavities with dense walls of
molecular gas and dust producing both the molecular-emission-line and
scattered-light structures seen at millimeter and visible wavelengths. The
large diffuse biconical shape of the nebula seen in the visible is likely due
to preferential illumination of the cold high-velocity outflow. We find a
compact source of millimeter-wave continuum in the nebular waist -- these data,
together with sensitive upper limits on the radio continuum using observations
with ATCA, indicate the presence of a substantial mass of very large (mm-sized)
grains in the waist of the nebula. Another unanticipated result is the
detection of CO emission regions beyond the ultracold region which indicate the
re-warming of the cold gas, most likely due to photoelectric grain heating.

which MC questions can be utilized pedagogically more like CR questions while
maintaining their attendant procedural advantages. we describe how an
answer-until-correct MC response format allows for the construction of
multiple-choice examinations designed to operate much as a hybrid between
standard MC and CR testing. With this tool - the immediate feedback assessment
technique (IF-AT) - students gain complete knowledge of the correct answer for
each question during the examination, and can use such information for solving
subsequent test items. This feature allows for the creation of a new type of
context-dependent item sets; the ""integrated testlet"". In an integrated testlet
certain items are purposefully inter-dependent and are thus presented in a
particular order. Such integrated testlets represent a proxy of typical CR

allows for granting partial credit for proximal knowledge. We present a case

cylindrical harmonics in the phenomenological description of two-particle
angular correlations from ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. These model
elements, whose dependence on relative azimuth angle has the form
$\cos[m(\phi_1-\phi_2)]$ where $m > 2$, were introduced to support a
hydrodynamic flow interpretation of the same-side ($|\phi_1-\phi_2| < \pi/2$)
2D peak in the correlations. Previous studies have shown that the $m > 2$
harmonics are not required by the data, that they destabilize the fitting
models, and that their net effect is to decompose the same-side peak into two
components, one being dependent on and the other being independent of relative
pseudorapidity. Thus we are lead to question whether descriptions of angular
correlation data including higher-order harmonics inform our understanding of
the same-side peak or heavy-ion collisions in general. Results from analysis of
two-dimensional angular correlation data from the Relativistic Heavy-Ion
Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) show that the RHIC data do
not exclude a single-Gaussian hypothesis for the same-side peak. We find that
the net effect of including the $m = 3$ harmonic or azimuth sextupole in the
fitting model is the inclusion of small non-Gaussian dependence in the
mathematical description of the same-side peak. Those non-Gaussian effects are
systematically insignificant and can be accommodated by minor perturbations to
the same-side 2D Gaussian peak model, which act locally at small relative
azimuth. We also demonstrate that the 0-1% 2D angular correlation data for 2.76
TeV Pb+Pb collisions from ATLAS, which display an away-side double peak on
azimuth, do not require a sextupole and exclude a positive same-side sextupole.

felt by a gravitational Plummer sphere with mass M and core radius Rs, moving

gas. Since the potential is non-diverging, there is no gas removal due to
accretion. When Rs is larger than the Bondi radius RB, the perturbation is
linear at every point and the drag force is well fitted by the time-dependent
Ostriker's formula with r_{min}= 2.25Rs, where r_{min} is the minimum impact
parameter in the Coulomb logarithm. In the deep nonlinear supersonic regime
(Rs<< RB), the minimum radius is no longer related with Rs but with RB. We find
r_min=3.3mach^{-2.5}RB, for Mach numbers of the perturber between $1.5$ and
$4$, although r_{min} = 2\mach^{-2}RB=2GM/V0^{2} also provides a good fit at
mach>2. As a consequence, the drag force does not depend sensitively on the
nonlinearity parameter RB/Rs, for RB/Rs-values larger than a certain critical
value. We show that our generalized Ostriker's formula for the drag force is
more accurate than the formula suggested by Kim & Kim (2009).

highly inhomogeneous and filamentary shell structure assumed to form during the
final phase of the high density wind. The simulations were performed with a new
hydrodynamics code integrated in the interactive framework of the astrophysical
modeling package SHAPE. In contrast to conventional astrophysical hydrodynamics
software, the new code does not require any programming intervention by the
user for setting up or controlling the code. Visualization and analysis of the
simulation data has been done in SHAPE without external software. The key
conclusion from the simulations is that secondary lobes in planetary nebulae,
such as Hubble 5 and K3-17, can be formed through the interaction of a fast
low-density wind with a complex high density environment, such as a filamentary
circumstellar shell. The more complicated alternative explanation of
intermittent collimated outflows that change direction, in many cases may
therefore not be necessary. We consider that the wind-shell interaction
scenario is more likely since the bow-shock shape expected from a strongly
cooling bow-shock from jets is different from that of the observed bubbles.
Furthermore, the timescales of the wind-wind interaction suggest that the
progenitor star was rather massive.

a central question, not only in the cosmochemistry and astrochemistry fields,
and requires various approaches to be combined. Measurements of isotopic ratios
in cometary materials provide strong constraints on the content of the
protosolar nebula. Their relation with the composition of the parental dark
clouds is, however, still very elusive. In this paper, we bring new constraints
based on the isotopic composition of nitrogen in dark clouds, with the aim of
understanding the chemical processes that are responsible for the observed
isotopic ratios. We have observed and detected the fundamental rotational
transition of C$^{15}$N towards two starless dark clouds, L1544 and L1498. We
were able to derive the column density ratio of C$^{15}$N over $^{13}$CN
towards the same clouds, and obtain the CN/C$^{15}$N isotopic ratios, which
were found to be $500\pm75$ for both L1544 and L1498. These values are
therefore marginally consistent with the protosolar value of 441. Moreover,
this ratio is larger than the isotopic ratio of nitrogen measured in HCN. In
addition, we present model calculations of the chemical fractionation of
nitrogen in dark clouds, which make it possible to understand how CN can be
deprived of $^{15}$N and HCN can simultaneously be enriched in heavy nitrogen.
The non-fractionation of N2H+, however, remains an open issue and we propose
some chemical way of alleviating the discrepancy between model predictions and
the observed ratios.

evidenced for a decade as intrinsic characteristics of ongoing brain activity
(Zarahn et al., 1997). Recently, scaling properties were shown to fluctuate
across brain networks and to be modulated between rest and task (He, 2011):
notably, Hurst exponent, quantifying long memory, decreases under task in
activating and deactivating brain regions. In most cases, such results were
obtained: First, from univariate (voxelwise or regionwise) analysis, hence
focusing on specific cognitive systems such as Resting-State Networks (RSNs)
and raising the issue of the specificity of this scale-free dynamics modulation
in RSNs. Second, using analysis tools designed to measure a single scaling
exponent related to the second order statistics of the data, thus relying on
models that either implicitly or explicitly assume Gaussianity and (asymptotic)
self-similarity, while fMRI signals may significantly depart from those either
of those two assumptions (Ciuciu et al., 2008; Wink et al., 2008). To address
these issues, the present contribution elaborates on the analysis of the
scaling properties of fMRI temporal dynamics by proposing two significant
variations. First, scaling properties are technically investigated using the
recently introduced Wavelet Leader-based Multifractal formalism (WLMF; Wendt et
al., 2007). This measures a collection of scaling exponents, thus enables a
richer and more versatile description of scale invariance (beyond correlation
and Gaussianity), referred to as multifractality. Also, it benefits from
improved estimation performance compared to tools previously used in the
literature. Second, scaling properties are investigated in both RSN and non-RSN
structures (e.g., artifacts), at a broader spatial scale than the voxel one,
using a multivariate approach, namely the Multi-Subject Dictionary Learning
(MSDL) algorithm (Varoquaux et al., 2011) that produces a set of spatial
components that appear more sparse than their Independent Component Analysis
(ICA) counterpart. These tools are combined and applied to a fMRI dataset
comprising 12 subjects with resting-state and activation runs (Sadaghiani et
al., 2009). Results stemming from those analysis confirm the already reported
task-related decrease of long memory in functional networks, but also show that
it occurs in artifacts, thus making this feature not specific to functional
networks. Further, results indicate that most fMRI signals appear multifractal
at rest except in non-cortical regions. Task-related modulation of
multifractality appears only significant in functional networks and thus can be
considered as the key property disentangling functional networks from
artifacts. These finding are discussed in the light of the recent literature
reporting scaling dynamics of EEG microstate sequences at rest and addressing
non-stationarity issues in temporally independent fMRI modes.

frequencies far below the pair breaking threshold and wave vectors much smaller
than the Fermi momentum, and the low frequency linear responses match well for
surprisingly large wave vectors, even up to the Fermi momentum. For non-linear
dynamics such as vortex generation, the ETF provides a semi-quantitative
description of SLDA dynamics as long as the fluctuations do not have
significant power near the pair breaking threshold, otherwise the dynamics of
the ETF cannot be trusted. Nonlinearities in the ETF tends to generate
high-frequency fluctuations, and with no normal component to remove this energy
from the superfluid, features like vortex lattices cannot relax and crystallize

reliability of ETF dynamics by considering the approximate conservation of

mobile applications as a location-time workflows (LTW) of tasks; here users
mobility patterns are translated to mobile service usage patterns. We show that
an optimal mapping of LTWs to tiered cloud resources considering multiple QoS
goals such application delay, device power consumption and user cost/price is
an NP-hard problem for both single and group-based applications. We propose an
efficient heuristic algorithm called MuSIC that is able to perform well (73% of
optimal, 30% better than simple strategies), and scale well to a large number
of users while ensuring high mobile application QoS. We evaluate MuSIC and the
2-tier mobile cloud approach via implementation (on real world clouds) and
extensive simulations using rich mobile applications like intensive signal
processing, video streaming and multimedia file sharing applications. Our
experimental and simulation results indicate that MuSIC supports scalable
operation (100+ concurrent users executing complex workflows) while improving
QoS. We observe about 25% lower delays and power (under fixed price
constraints) and about 35% decrease in price (considering fixed delay) in
comparison to only using the public cloud. Our studies also show that MuSIC
performs quite well under different mobility patterns, e.g. random waypoint and
Manhattan models.

previously identified red supergiant star was the progenitor of this SN and has
now disappeared. Image subtraction techniques were used to conduct precise
photometry of the now missing progenitor, independently of blending from any
nearby stars. The nature of the surrounding stellar population and their
contribution to the flux attributed to the progenitor in the pre-explosion

Minit=12.9+/-1.7Msun. The temperature of the progenitor was hotter than
previously expected for RSGs (T ~ 4330K), but consistent with new temperatures
derived for RSGs using SED fitting techniques. We show that there is evidence

find that the presence of a multiphase interstellar media in our models
promotes the growth of disc instability favouring the formation of clumps which
in general, are not easily disrupted on timescales compared to the migration
time. We show that stellar clumps migrate towards the central region and
contribute to form a classical-like bulge with a Sersic index, n > 2. Our
physically-motivated Supernova feedback has a mild influence on clump survival
and evolution, partially limiting the mass growth of clumps as the energy
released per Supernova event is increased, with the consequent flattening of
the bulge profile. This regulation does not prevent the building of a
classical-like bulge even for the most energetic feedback tested. Our Supernova
feedback model is able to establish a self-regulated star formation, producing
mass-loaded outflows and stellar age spreads comparable to observations. We
find that the bulge formation by clumps may coexit with other channels of bulge
assembly such as bar and mergers. Our results suggest that galactic bulges
could be interpreted as composite systems with structural components and
stellar populations storing archaeological information of the dynamical history

Yet,
since thousands of years, no effective strategy has been found to overcome
crime. To the contrary, empirical evidence shows that crime is recurrent, a
fact that is not captured well by rational choice theories of crime. According
to these, strong enough punishment should prevent crime from happening. To gain
a better understanding of the relationship between crime and punishment, we
consider that the latter requires prior discovery of illicit behavior and study
a spatial version of the inspection game. Simulations reveal the spontaneous
emergence of cyclic dominance between ''criminals'', ''inspectors'', and
''ordinary people'' as a consequence of spatial interactions. Such cycles
dominate the evolutionary process, in particular when the temptation to commit
crime or the cost of inspection are low or moderate. Yet, there are also
critical parameter values beyond which cycles cease to exist and the population
is dominated either by a stable mixture of criminals and inspectors or one of
these two strategies alone. Both continuous and discontinuous phase transitions
to different final states are possible, indicating that successful strategies
to contain crime can be very much counter-intuitive and complex. Our results
demonstrate that spatial interactions are crucial for the evolutionary outcome
of the inspection game, and they also reveal why criminal behavior is likely to

Systems with Tightly-packed Inner Planets (STIPs). We find that the majority of
closely-spaced stable two-planet systems can stably support satellites across a
range of parameter-space which is only slightly decreased compared to that seen
for the single-planet case. In particular, circular prograde satellites remain
stable out to $\sim 0.4 R_H$ (where $R_H$ is the Hill Radius) as opposed to
$\sim 0.5 R_H$ in the single-planet case. A similarly small restriction in the
stable parameter-space for retrograde satellites is observed, where planetary
close approaches in the range 2.5 to 4.5 mutual Hill radii destabilize most
satellites orbits only if $a\sim 0.65 R_H$. In very close planetary pairs (e.g.
the 12:11 resonance) the addition of a satellite frequently destabilizes the
entire system, causing extreme close-approaches and the loss of satellites over
a range of circumplanetary semi-major axes. The majority of systems
investigated stably harbored satellites over a wide parameter-space, suggesting
that STIPs can generally offer a dynamically stable home for satellites, albeit
with a slightly smaller stable parameter-space than the single-planet case. As
we demonstrate that multi-planet systems are not a priori poor candidates for
hosting satellites, future measurements of satellite occurrence rates in
multi-planet systems versus single-planet systems could be used to constrain
either satellite formation or past periods of strong dynamical interaction

planet, making this system an excellent target for atmospheric studies. Most
studies find that the transmission spectrum of GJ 1214b is flat, which favors
either a high mean molecular weight or cloudy/hazy hydrogen (H) rich atmosphere
model. Photometry at short wavelengths (< 0.7 micron) and in the K-band can
discriminate the most between these different atmosphere models for GJ 1214b,
but current observations do not have sufficiently high precision. We present
photometry of seven transits of GJ 1214b through a narrow K-band (2.141 micron)
filter with the Wide Field Camera on the 3.8 m United Kingdom Infrared
Telescope. Our photometric precision is typically 1.7x10^-3 (for a single
transit), comparable with other ground-based observations of GJ 1214b. We
measure a planet-star radius ratio of 0.1158+/-0.0013, which, along with other
studies, also supports a flat transmission spectrum for GJ 1214b. Since this
does not exclude a scenario where GJ 1214b has a H-rich envelope with heavy
elements that are sequestered below a cloud/haze layer, we compare K-band
observations with models of H_2 collision-induced absorption in an atmosphere
for a range of temperatures. While we find no evidence for deviation from a
flat spectrum (slope s = 0.0016+/-0.0038), an H_2 dominated upper atmosphere (<
60 mbar) cannot be excluded. More precise observations at < 0.7 micron and in
the K-band as well as a uniform analysis of all published data would be useful
for establishing more robust limits on atmosphere models for GJ 1214b.

of the gas in different phases. The correlation between global CO(3-2) line
fluxes and FIR-submillimetre fluxes weakens with increasing IR wavelength
({\lambda}>60{\mu}m), as a result of colder dust being less strongly associated
with dense gas. Conversely, CO(2-1) and HI line fluxes both appear to be better
correlated with longer wavelengths, suggesting that cold dust is more strongly
associated with diffuse atomic and molecular gas phases, consistent with it
being at least partially heated by radiation from old stellar populations. The
increased scatter at long wavelengths implies that submillimetre fluxes are a
poorer tracer of SFR. Fluxes at 22 and 60{\mu}m are also better correlated with
diffuse gas tracers than dense CO(3-2), probably due to very-small-grain
emission in the diffuse interstellar medium, which is not correlated with SFR.
The FIR/CO luminosity ratio and the dust mass/CO luminosity ratio both decrease
with increasing luminosity, as a result of either correlations between mass and
metallicity (changing CO/H2) or between CO luminosity and excitation [changing
CO(3-2)/CO(1-0)].

also argue that the temperature - metallicity relation, reported earlier in the

calibrate the relationship between the temperature-density ($T$--$\Delta$)

and velocity widths, $b_{\rm HI}$, of discrete Ly$\alpha$ forest absorbers.
This calibration is then applied to the measurement of the lower cut-off of the
$b_{\rm HI}$--$N_{\rm HI}$ distribution recently presented by Rudie et al.
(2012). We infer a power-law $T$--$\Delta$ relation,
$T=T_{0}\Delta^{\gamma-1}$, with a temperature at mean density,
$T_{0}=[1.00^{+0.32}_{-0.21}]\times10^{4}\rm\,K$ and slope
$(\gamma-1)=0.54\pm0.11$. The slope is fully consistent with that advocated by
the analysis of Rudie et al (2012); however, the temperature at mean density is
lower by almost a factor of two, primarily due to an adjustment in the
relationship between column density and physical density assumed by these
authors. These new results are in excellent agreement with the recent
temperature measurements of Becker et al. (2011), based on the curvature of the
transmitted flux in the Ly$\alpha$ forest. This suggests that the thermal state

galaxy IRAS 20551-4250 at z=0.043, which is known to host an energetically
important obscured AGN. In addition to the targeted HCN, HCO+, and HNC J=4-3
emission lines, two additional strong emission lines are seen, which we
attribute to H2S and CH3CN(+CCH). The HCN-to-HCO+ J=4-3 flux ratio (~0.7) is
higher than in the other starburst-dominated galaxy (~0.2) observed in our ALMA
Cycle 0 program. We tentatively (~5 sigma) detected the vibrationally excited
(v2=1) HCN J=4-3 (l=1f) emission line, which is important for testing an
infrared radiative pumping scenario for HCN. This is the second detection of
this molecular transition in external galaxies. The most likely reason for this
detection is not only the high flux of this emission line, but also the small
molecular line widths observed in this galaxy, suggesting that vibrational
excitation of HCN may be relatively common in AGN-hosting galaxies.

among a sample of 31 local infrared-bright starburst galaxies is carried out in
light of their HST-based merger classifications. Radio data covering as many as
10 individual bands allows for spectral indices to be measured over three
frequency bins between 0.15-32.5 GHz. Sources having the flattest spectral
indices measured at ~2 and 4 GHz, arising from large free-free optical depths
among the densest starbursts, appear to be in ongoing through post-stage
mergers. The spectral indices measured at higher frequencies (i.e., ~12 GHz)
are steepest for sources associated with ongoing mergers in which their nuclei
are distinct, but either share a common stellar envelope and/or exhibit tidal
tails. These results hold after excluding potential AGN based on their low
6.2um PAH EQWs. Consequently, the low-, mid-, and high-frequency spectral
indices each appear to be sensitive to the exact merger stage. It is
additionally shown that ongoing mergers, whose progenitors are still separated
and share a common envelope and/or exhibit tidal tails, also exhibit excess
radio emission relative to what is expected given the far-infrared/radio
correlation, suggesting that there may be a significant amount of radio
emission that is not associated with ongoing star formation. The combination of
these observations, along with high-resolution radio morphologies, leads to a
picture in which the steep high-frequency radio spectral indices and excess
radio emission arises from radio continuum bridges and tidal tails that are not
associated with star formation, similar to what is observed for so-called
""taffy"" galaxies. This scenario may also explain the seemingly low
far-infrared/radio ratios measured for many high-z submillimeter galaxies, a
number of which are merger-driven starbursts.

metallicity, extinction, present day mass function (MF) --- we use the maximum
likelihood color-magnitude diagram (CMD) fitting program MATCH and the
Dartmouth, Padova and BaSTI stellar evolution models. For AM 4, the Dartmouth
models provide the best match to the CMD and yield an age of >13 Gyr,
metallicity log Z/Z_solar = -1.68 +/- 0.08, a distance modulus (m-M)_V = 17.47
+/- 0.03 and reddening A_V = 0.19 +/- 0.02. For Pal 13 the Dartmouth models
give an age of 13.4 +/- 0.5 Gyr, log Z/Z_solar = -1.55 +/- 0.06, (m-M)_V =
17.17 +/- 0.02 and A_V = 0.43 +/- 0.01. We find that the systematic
uncertainties due to choice in assumed stellar model greatly exceed the random
uncertainties, highlighting the importance of using multiple stellar models
when analyzing stellar populations. Assuming a single-sloped power law MF, we
find that AM 4 and Pal 13 have spectral indices alpha = +0.68 +/- 0.34 and
alpha = -1.67 +/- 0.25 (where a Salpeter MF has alpha = +1.35), respectively.
Comparing our derived slopes with literature measurements of cluster integrated
magnitude (M_V) and MF slope indicates that AM 4 is an outlier. Its MF slope is
substantially steeper than clusters of comparable luminosity, while Pal 13 has
a MF in line with the general trend. We discuss both primordial and dynamical
origins for the unusual MF slope of AM 4 and tentatively favor the dynamical
scenario. However, MF slopes of more low luminosity clusters are needed to
verify this hypothesis.

continuous or discontinuous depending upon the relative influence of the

wavelengths we observe heated pole caps from the white dwarf caused by
accretion of wind material from the main-sequence star on to the white dwarf.
At near-infrared wavelengths we see the eclipse of two poles on the surface of
the white dwarf by the main-sequence star, indicating that the white dwarf is
magnetic. Our spectroscopic observations reveal Zeeman split emission lines in
the hydrogen Balmer series, which we use to measure the magnetic field strength
as 8MG. This measurement indicates that the cyclotron lines are located in the
infrared, naturally explaining the infrared excess without the need for a
circumbinary dust disk. We also detect magnetically-confined material located
roughly midway between the two stars. Using measurements of the radial velocity
amplitude and rotational broadening of the M star we constrain the physical

intensity peaks in the range of 30-60 MeV, decreasing at both lower energies
down to a few MeV and at higher energies up to several hundred MeV. We have
modeled the propagation of these particles in the galaxy using an updated Leaky
Box Diffusion model which determines the spectra of these components from ~2
MeV to >200 GeV. The key parameters used in the model are a galactic input
spectrum ~P^-2.24, the same for all components and independent of rigidity, and
a diffusion coefficient that is ~P^0.5 above a lower rigidity and increases
~beta^-1.0 below a lower rigidity ~0.56 GV. These same parameters also fit the
high energy H and He data from ~10-200 GeV/nuc from the PAMELA and BESS
experiments. The new Voyager spectra for all three nuclei are thus consistent
with rigidity spectra ~P^-2.24 from the lowest energies to at least 100 GeV.
Deviations from this spectrum can reasonably be attributed to propagation
effects. Some deviations between the calculated and newly observed spectra are
noted, however, below ~30 MeV/nuc, particularly for C/O nuclei, that could be
significant regarding the propagation and sources of these particles.

that disease-associated missense mutations are more prevalent in each class of
binding site than are neutral mutations. Importantly, our approach identifies
considerably more binding sites than those annotated in the RefSeq database.
Furthermore, an analysis of metal ion and protein-protein binding sites
predicted by machine learning shows a similar preponderance of

mutations that likely disrupt ion binding but were not previously considered

particle in Friedmann--Robertson--Walker and G\""odel spacetimes, as well as in
a general Schwarzschild-like spacetime and in static spherically symmetric
conformally flat spacetimes. Exact solutions for the motion of the particle and
general exact expressions for the momenta and velocities are displayed for
different cases. In particular, the solution for the motion in spherically
symmetric metrics is presented in the equatorial plane. The exact solutions are
found using constants of motion of the particle, namely its mass, its spin, its
angular momentum, and a fourth constant, which is its energy when the metric is
time independent, and a different constant otherwise. These constants are
associated to Killing vectors. In the case of the motion on the
Friedmann--Robertson--Walker metric, a new constant of motion is found. This is
the fourth constant which generalizes previously known results obtained for
spinless particles. In the case of general Schwarzschild-like spacetimes, our
results allow for the exploration of the case of the
Reissner-Nordstrom-(Anti)de Sitter metric. Finally, for the case of the
conformally flat spacetimes, the solution is explicitly evaluated for different
metric tensors associated to a universe filled with static perfect fluids and
electromagnetic radiation. For some combination of the values of the constants
of motion the particle trajectories may exhibit spacelike velocity vectors in
portions of the trajectories.

topological superfluid with an isotropic energy gap separating the ground-state
and bulk continuum states. We report calculations of surface spectrum, spin-
and mass current densities originating from the Andreev surface states for
confined $^3$He-B. The surface states are Majorana Fermions with their spins
polarized transverse to their direction of propagation along the surface. The
negative energy states give rise to a ground-state helical spin current
confined on the surface. The spectral functions reveal the subtle role of the
spin-polarized surface states in relation to the ground-state spin current. By
contrast, these states do not contribute to the $T=0$ mass current. Superfluid
flow through a channel of confined $^3$He-B is characterized by the flow field,
$p_s$. The flow field breaks 2D rotational symmetry and time reversal (T).
However, the Bogoliubov-Nambu Hamiltonian remains invariant under $T$ combined
with a 180 degree rotation about the normal to the film. As a result the
B-phase in the presence of a superflow remains a topological phase with a
gapless spectrum of Majorana modes on the surface. Thermal excitation of the
Doppler shifted Majorana branches leads to a power law suppression of the
superfluid mass current, providing a direct signature of the Majorana branches
of surface excitations in the fully gapped 3D topological superfluid, $^3$He-B.
Results are reported for the superfluid fraction (mass current) and helical
spin current for confined $^3$He-B, including the temperature dependences, as
well as dependences on confinement, interactions between quasiparticles and
pressure.

asymmetric, with the local ground state in the shallow well nearly degenerate
with the first excited state of the adjacent deep well. We compare the band
structure obtained from a tight-binding (TB) model with that obtained
numerically using a plane wave basis. We find the TB model to be in
quantitative agreement for the lowest two bands, qualitative for next two
bands, and inadequate for even higher bands. The band widths of the excited
bands are much larger than the harmonic oscillator energy spacing in the $z$
direction. We then study the thermodynamics of a non-interacting Bose gas in
the first excited band. We estimate the condensate fraction and critical
temperature, $T_c$, as functions of lattice parameters. For typical atom
numbers, the critical energy $k_BT_c$, with $k_B$ the Boltzmann constant, is
larger than the excited band widths and harmonic oscillator energy. Using
conservation of total energy and atom number, we show that the temperature
increases after the lattice transformation. Finally, we estimate the time scale
for a two-body collision-aided decay of the condensate as a function of lattice
parameters. The decay involves two processes, the dominant one in which both
colliding atoms decay to the ground band, and the second involving excitation
of one atom to a higher band. For this estimate, we have used TB wave functions
for the lowest four bands, and numerical estimates for higher bands. The decay
rate rapidly increases with lattice depth, but stays smaller than the tunneling

to generate a set of primordial star-forming gas clouds. We then follow
protostar formation in each gas cloud and the subsequent protostellar evolution
until the gas mass accretion onto the protostar is halted by stellar radiative
feedback. The accretion rates differ significantly among the primordial gas
clouds which largely determine the final stellar masses. For low accretion
rates the growth of a protostar is self-regulated by radiative feedback effects
and the final mass is limited to several tens of solar masses. At high
accretion rates the protostar's outer envelope continues to expand and the
effective surface temperature remains low; such protostars do not exert strong
radiative feedback and can grow in excess to one hundred solar masses. The
obtained wide mass range suggests that the first stars play a variety of roles
in the early universe, by triggering both core-collapse supernovae and
pair-instability supernovae as well as by leaving stellar mass black holes. We
find certain correlations between the final stellar mass and the physical
properties of the star-forming cloud. These correlations can be used to
estimate the mass of the first star from the properties of the parent cloud or

mass reaches 10^{4 - 5} Msun. Our stellar evolution calculations show that a
star becomes supermassive while passing through the ""supergiant protostar""
stage, whereby the star has a very bloated envelope and a contracting inner

=~ 100 AU for M_* >~ 10^4 Msun, after which the star begins to slowly contract.
Because of the large radius the effective temperature is always less than 10^4

transparent to the stellar radiation. Only for M_* >~ 10^5 Msun can stellar UV
feedback operate and disturb the mass accretion flow. We also examine the
pulsation stability of accreting SMSs, showing that the pulsation-driven mass
loss does not prevent stellar mass growth. Observational signatures of bloated
SMSs should be detectable with future observational facilities such as the
James Webb Space Telescope. Our results predict that an inner core of the

acquisition framework that employs K > 2 conventional cameras, each of which
makes random measurements of the 3D video signal in both temporal and spatial
domains. For each of the K cameras, this multi-camera strategy greatly relaxes
the stringent requirements in memory speed, shutter speed, and illumination

solved as a large scale l1 minimization problem by exploiting joint temporal
and spatial sparsities of the 3D signal. Three coded video acquisition
techniques of varied trade offs between performance and hardware complexity are
developed: frame-wise coded acquisition, pixel-wise coded acquisition, and
column-row-wise coded acquisition. The performances of these techniques are
analyzed in relation to the sparsity of the underlying video signal.

probes the properties of the ionized Inter-Galactic Medium (IGM). We relate the
degree of temporal smearing and the profile of a scattered source to the
evolution of turbulent structure in the IGM as a function of redshift. We
estimate the degree of scattering expected by analysing the contributions to
the Scattering Measure (SM) of the various components of baryonic matter
embedded in the IGM, including the diffuse IGM, intervening galaxies and
intracluster gas. These estimates predict that the amount of temporal smearing
expected at 300\,MHz is typically as low as ~1 ms and suggests that these
bursts may be detectable with low frequency widefield arrays. A generalization
of the DM-SM relation observed for Galactic scattering to the densities and
turbulent conditions relevant to the IGM suggests that scattering measures of
order 10^{-6} kpc m {-20/3} would be expected at z ~ 1. This scattering is
sufficiently low that its effects would, for most lines of sight, not be
manifest in existing observations of the scattering broadening in images of
extragalactic compact sources. The redshift dependence of the temporal smearing
discriminates between scattering that occurs in the host galaxy of the burst
and the IGM, with tau_host \propto (1+z)^{-3} if the scattering probes length
scales below the inner scale of the turbulence or tau_host \propto
(1+z)^{-17/5} if the turbulence follows a Kolmogorov spectrum. This differs
strongly from the expected IGM scaling tau_{IGM} ~ z^2 for z < 1 and

superconductivity. We impose flavor conservation during the transition in such
a way that just deconfined quark matter is transitorily out of equilibrium with
respect to weak interactions. Our results show that color superconductivity
facilitates the transition for temperatures below $T_c$. This effect may be
strong if the superconducting gap is large enough. As in previous work we find
that trapped neutrinos increase the critical density for deconfinement;
however, if the just deconfined phase is color superconducting this effect is
weaker than if deconfined matter is unpaired. We also explore the effect of
different parametrizations of the hadronic equation of state (GM1 and NL3) and
the effect of hyperons in the hadronic phase. We compare our results with those

also uses a twisted proposal as in Whiteley, et al (2013) to obtain a
low-variance estimate of the HMM normalising constant. We demonstrate via
numerical examples that, in some scenarios, this estimate has a much lower

low variance of this normalising constant estimate encourages the
implementation of our SMC algorithm within a particle marginal

next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy. Use of the DIS event shape
1-jettiness ensures that events have two well-collimated jets. We calculate
distributions for three versions of 1-jettiness that have different sensitivity
to the transverse momentum of the ISR, and derive factorization theorems for
each of them using the soft collinear effective theory (SCET). The structure of
the transverse momentum dependence in the factorization theorems is different
for each 1-jettiness. We present numerical results for these three observables

practical switching systems to date. The aim of this paper is to show that the
modular structure of Clos networks is invariant with respect to the
technological changes. Due to the wavelength routing property of
arrayed-waveguide gratings (AWGs), non-blocking and contention-free
wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) switches require that two calls carried
by the same wavelength must be connected by separated links; otherwise, they
must be carried by different wavelengths. Thus, in addition to the non-blocking
condition, the challenge of the design of AWG-based multistage switching
networks is to scale down the wavelength granularity and to reduce the
conversion range of tunable wavelength converters (TWCs). We devise a logic
scheme to partition the WDM switch network into wavelength autonomous cells,
and show that the wavelength scalability problem can be solved by recursively
reusing similar, but smaller, set of wavelengths in different cells.
Furthermore, we prove that the rearrangeably non-blocking (RNB) condition and
route assignments in these AWG-based three-stage networks are consistent with
that of classical Clos networks. Thus, the optimal AWG-based non-blocking Clos
networks also can achieve 100% utilization when all input and output wavelength
channels are busy.

one-shot polarimetry of the HOWPol installed to the Kanata telescope, we have
detected very rapid variability in the polarized-flux light curve on MJD 56281

respectively. The polarization degree (PD) reached 36 +/- 3% at the peak of the
short-duration pulse, while polarization angle (PA) remained almost constant.
In addition, temporal profiles of the total flux and PD showed highly variable
but well correlated behavior and discrete correlation function analysis
revealed that no significant time lag of more than 10 min was present. The high
PD and minute-scale variability in polarized flux provides a clear evidence of
synchrotron radiation from a very compact emission region of 10^14 cm size with
highly ordered magnetic field. Such micro variability of polarization are also
observed in several blazar jets, but its complex relation between total flux

different depending on the vector and the two-form models, but the statistical
anisotropies generally lead to a suppressed tensor-to-scalar ratio r and a

different inflaton potentials such as those in chaotic and natural inflation in
the presence of anisotropic interactions. In the two-form model we also find
that there is no cross correlation between scalar and tensor perturbations,

phenomena, among them the so-called hidden-order phases that in contrast to
conventional magnetic order are invisible to standard neutron diffraction. One
of the oldest and structurally simplest hidden-order compounds, CeB6, became
famous for an elusive phase that was attributed to the antiferroquadrupolar
ordering of cerium-4f moments. In its ground state, CeB6 also develops a more
usual antiferromagnetic (AFM) order. Hence, its essential low-temperature
physics was always considered to be solely governed by AFM interactions between
the dipolar and multipolar Ce moments. Here we overturn this established
perspective by uncovering an intense ferromagnetic (FM) low-energy collective
mode that dominates the magnetic excitation spectrum of CeB6. Our inelastic
neutron-scattering data reveal that the intensity of this FM excitation by far
exceeds that of conventional spin-wave magnons emanating from the AFM wave
vectors, thus placing CeB6 much closer to a FM instability than could be
anticipated. This propensity of CeB6 to ferromagnetism may account for much of
its unexplained behavior, such as the existence of a pronounced electron spin
resonance, and should lead to a substantial revision of existing theories that
have so far largely neglected the role of FM interactions.

Results.We determined accurate abundances for 39 elements, including 19
neutron-capture elements. HE 1405-0822 is a red giant. Its strong enhancements
of C, N, and s-elements are the consequence of enrichment by a former AGB

element abundances (including Eu, Yb, and Hf) seen in HE 1405-0822 do not agree
with the r-process pattern seen in strongly r-process-enhanced stars. We
discuss possible enrichment scenarios for this star. The enhanced alpha
elements can be explained as the result of enrichment by supernovae of type II.

mobility for pervasive information exploration and collection; it has been
deemed as a promising paradigm that will revolutionize various research and
application domains. Unfortunately, the practicality of mobile crowdsensing can
be crippled due to the lack of incentive mechanisms that stimulate human
participation. In this paper, we study incentive mechanisms for a novel Mobile
Crowdsensing Scheduling (MCS) problem, where a mobile crowdsensing application
owner announces a set of sensing tasks, then human users (carrying mobile
devices) compete for the tasks based on their respective sensing costs and
available time periods, and finally the owner schedules as well as pays the
users to maximize its own sensing revenue under a certain budget. We prove that
the MCS problem is NP-hard and propose polynomial-time approximation mechanisms
for it. We also show that our approximation mechanisms (including both offline
and online versions) achieve desirable game-theoretic properties, namely
truthfulness and individual rationality, as well as O(1) performance ratios.
Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to demonstrate the correctness and

rescaled local times of a continuous-time random walk among random conductances
(RWRC) in a time-dependent, growing box in $\Z^d$. We work in the interesting
case that the conductances are positive, but may assume arbitrarily small
values. Thus, the underlying picture of the principle is a joint strategy of
small conductance values and large holding times of the walk. The speed and the
rate function of our principle are explicit in terms of the lower tails of the
conductance distribution as well as the time-dependent size of the box.
  An interesting phase transition occurs if the thickness parameter of the
conductance tails exceeds a certain threshold: for thicker tails, the random
walk spreads out over the entire growing box, for thinner tails it stays
confined to some bounded region. In fact, in the first case, the rate function
turns out to be equal to the $p$-th power of the $p$-norm of the gradient of
the square root for some $p\in(\frac {2d}{d+2},2)$. This extends the
Donsker-Varadhan-G\""artner rate function for the local times of Brownian motion
(with deterministic environment) from $p=2$ to these values.
  As corollaries of our LDP, we derive the logarithmic asymptotics of the
non-exit probability of the RWRC from the growing box, and the Lifshitz tails
of the generator of the RWRC, the randomised Laplace operator.
  To contrast with the annealed, not uniformly elliptic case, we also provide
an LDP in the quenched setting for conductances that are bounded and bounded
away from zero. The main tool here is a spectral homogenisation result, based
on a quenched invariance principle for the RWRC.

not been fully investigated yet. The complex network theory, which provides a
robust tool to investigate the statistical interdependence of many interacting
elements, is used here to analyze the spatial dynamics of annual precipitation
over seventy years (1941-2010).
  The precipitation network reveals significant spatial variability with barely
connected regions, as Eastern China and Japan, and highly connected regions,
such as the African Sahel, Eastern Australia and, to a lesser extent, Northern
Europe. Sahel and Eastern Australia are remarkably dry regions, where low
amounts of rainfall are uniformly distributed on continental scales and
small-scale extreme events are rare. As a consequence, the precipitation
gradient is low, making these regions well connected on a large spatial scale.
On the contrary, the Asiatic South-East is often reached by extreme events such
as monsoons, tropical cyclones and heat waves, which can all contribute to
reduce the correlation to the short-range scale only.
  Some patterns emerging between mid-latitude and tropical regions suggest a
possible impact of the propagation of planetary waves on precipitation at a
global scale. Other links can be qualitatively associated to the atmospheric
and oceanic circulation. To analyze the sensitivity of the network to the
physical closeness of the nodes, short-term connections are broken. The African
Sahel, Eastern Australia and Northern Europe regions again appear as the
supernodes of the network, confirming furthermore their long-range connection
structure. Almost all North-American and Asian nodes vanish, revealing that
extreme events can enhance high precipitation gradients, leading to a
systematic absence of long-range patterns.

and a massive star. Non-thermal emission up to TeV energies is observed near
periastron passage, attributed to emission from high energy e+e- pairs
accelerated at the shock with the circumstellar material from the companion
star, resulting in a small-scale pulsar wind nebula. Weak gamma-ray emission
was detected by the Fermi/LAT at the last periastron passage, unexpectedly
followed 30 days later by a strong flare, limited to the GeV band, during which
the luminosity nearly reached the spindown power of the pulsar. The origin of
this GeV flare remains mysterious. We investigate whether the flare could have
been caused by pairs, located in the vicinity of the pulsar, up-scattering
X-ray photons from the surrounding pulsar wind nebula rather than UV stellar
photons, as usually assumed. Such a model is suggested by the geometry of the
interaction region at the time of the flare. We compute the gamma-ray
lightcurve for this scenario, based on a simplified description of the
interaction region, and compare it to the observations. The GeV lightcurve
peaks well after periastron with this geometry. The pairs are inferred to have
a Lorentz factor ~500. They also produce an MeV flare with a luminosity ~1e34
erg/s prior to periastron passage. A significant drawback is the very high
energy density of target photons required for efficient GeV emission. We
propose to associate the GeV-emitting pairs with the Maxwellian expected at
shock locations corresponding to high pulsar latitudes, while the rest of the
non-thermal emission arises from pairs accelerated in the equatorial region of
the pulsar wind termination shock.

option to complement and extend the LHC physics programme. A lepton collider
will allow for exploration of Standard Model Physics, such as precise
measurements of the Higgs, top and gauge sectors, in addition to enabling a
multitude of New Physics searches. However, physics analyses at such a collider
will place unprecedented demands on calorimetry, with a required jet energy
resolution of \sigma(E)/E < 3.5%. To meet these requirements will need a new
approach to calorimetry.
  The particle flow approach to calorimetry requires both fine granularity
detectors and sophisticated software algorithms. It promises to deliver
unparalleled jet energy resolution by fully reconstructing the paths of
individual particles through the detector. The energies of charged particles
can then be extracted from precise inner detector tracker measurements, whilst
photon energies will be measured in the ECAL, and only neutral hadron energies
(10% of jet energies) will be measured in the HCAL, largely avoiding the
typically poor HCAL resolution.
  This document introduces the Pandora particle flow algorithms, which offer
the current state of the art in particle flow calorimetry for the ILC and CLIC.

universal equality linking directional fidelity of an arbitrary nanoscale
object to the least possible energy driving it. The fidelity-energy equality
depends on the environmental temperature alone; any lower energy would violate
the 2nd law in a thought experiment. Real experimental proof for the equality
comes from force-induced motion of biological nanomotors by three independent
groups for translational as well as rotational motion. Interestingly, the
natural self-propelled motion of a biological nanomotor (F1-ATPase) known to

allowed by physical laws pertains to study of nanomotors from biology as well

system as it is the only nanomotor known for extreme energy conversion near the
limit of energy conservation. Using a unified theoretical framework centred on
a concept called directional fidelity, we analyze recent experiments in which
F1-motor's performance was measured for controlled chemical potentials, and
expose from the experiments quantitative evidence for the motor's multiple
extreme performance in directional fidelity, speed and catalytic capability
close to physical limits. Specifically, the motor nearly exhausts available
energy from the fuel to retain the highest possible directional fidelity for
arbitrary load, encompassing the motor's extreme energy conversion and beyond.
The theory-experiment comparison implies a tight chemomechanical coupling up to
stalemate as futile steps occur but unlikely involve fuel consumption. The
F1-motor data also helps clarify relation between directional fidelity and
experimentally measured stepping ratio.

and linked with the existence of multiple populations therein. Since these
systems are less massive than globulars, our results may allow us to constrain
the lower mass necessary to form more than one stellar population. Methods: We
measured the strength of the CN and CH bands, which correlate with the C and N
abundances, using four molecular indices in low-resolution SDSS/SEGUE spectra.
Results: We found that for four of the open clusters (NGC 2158, NGC 2420, NGC
2682 and Berkeley 29) all the stars studied in each of them have similar CN and
CH band strengths within the uncertainties since neither anomalous spreads nor
bimodalities have been detected in their CN and CH distributions. In contrast,
for NGC 7789 we found an anomalous spread in the strength of the CN molecular
band at 3839 \AA which is larger than the uncertainties. However, the small
number of stars studied in this cluster implies that further analysis is needed
to confirm the existence of chemical inhomogeneities in this cluster.

MR2251-178 (z = 0.06398) is presented. The observations were carried out in
2011 using the Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating and the XMM-Newton
Reflection Grating Spectrometer, with net exposure times of approximately 400
ks each. A multitude of absorption lines from C to Fe are detected, revealing
at least 3 warm absorbing components ranging in ionization parameter from
log(\xi/erg cm s^-1) = 1-3 and with outflow velocities < 500 km/s. The lowest
ionization absorber appears to vary between the Chandra and XMM-Newton
observations, which implies a radial distance of between 9-17 pc from the black
hole. Several broad soft X-ray emission lines are strongly detected, most
notably from He-like Oxygen, with FWHM velocity widths of up to 10000 km/s,
consistent with an origin from Broad Line Region (BLR) clouds. In addition to
the warm absorber, gas partially covering the line of sight to the quasar
appears to be present, of typical column density N_H = 10^23 cm^-2. We suggest
that the partial covering absorber may arise from the same BLR clouds
responsible for the broad soft X-ray emission lines. Finally the presence of a
highly ionised outflow in the iron K band from both 2002 and 2011 Chandra HETG
observations appears to be confirmed, which has an outflow velocity of -15600
\pm 2400 km/s. However a partial covering origin for the iron K absorption
cannot be excluded, resulting from low ionization material with little or no
outflow velocity.

multiple-output (MIMO) systems operating under quality-of-service (QoS)
constraints, interference limitations, and imperfect channel sensing, are
studied. It is assumed that transmission power and covariance of the input
signal vectors are varied depending on the sensed activities of primary users
(PUs) in the system. Interference constraints are applied on the transmission
power levels of cognitive radios (CRs) to provide protection for the PUs whose
activities are modeled as a Markov chain. Considering the reliability of the
transmissions and channel sensing results, a state-transition model is
provided. Throughput is determined by formulating the effective capacity. First
derivative of the effective capacity is derived in the low-power regime and the
minimum bit energy requirements in the presence of QoS limitations and
imperfect sensing results are identified. Minimum energy per bit is shown to be
achieved by beamforming in the maximal-eigenvalue eigenspace of certain
matrices related to the channel matrix. In a special case, wideband slope is
determined for more refined analysis of energy efficiency. Numerical results
are provided for the throughput for various levels of buffer constraints and
different number of transmit and receive antennas. The impact of interference
constraints and benefits of multiple-antenna transmissions are determined. It
is shown that increasing the number of antennas when the interference power
constraint is stringent is generally beneficial. On the other hand, it is shown
that under relatively loose interference constraints, increasing the number of
antennas beyond a certain level does not lead to much increase in the
throughput.

Gain in one of the resonators is provided by optically pumping Erbium (Er3+)
ions embedded in the silica matrix; the other resonator exhibits passive loss.
The coupling strength between the resonators is adjusted by using
nanopositioning stages to tune their distance. We have observed reciprocal
behavior of the PT-symmetric system in the linear regime, as well as a
transition to nonreciprocity in the PT symmetry-breaking phase transition due
to the significant enhancement of nonlinearity in the broken-symmetry phase.

the requester pays a cost and receives the reward but the provider learns the
information. In our framework, learners are modeled as cooperative contextual

which involves trading off the reward received from its own actions, the
information learned from its own actions, the reward received from the actions
requested of others and the cost paid for these actions - taking into account
what it has learned about the value of assistance from each other learner. We
develop distributed online learning algorithms and provide analytic bounds to

to be stressed in such a way that tensile and compressive forces of the same
value alternate. In the general considerations, the layers are assumed to be of
a general, unspecified {\em periodic} structure, where such self-equilibrated

each time frame (slot), the transmitter is either silent or transmits a
codeword from a given (randomly selected) codebook. The task of the decoder is
to decide whether transmission has taken place, and if so, to decode the
message. We derive the optimum detection/decoding rule in the sense of the best
trade-off among the probabilities of decoding error, false alarm, and
misdetection. For this detection/decoding rule, we then derive single-letter
characterizations of the exact exponential rates of these three probabilities

ground-state (GS) phase diagram of a spin-half ($s=1/2$) $J_{1}$-$J_{2}$
Heisenberg model on a cross-striped square lattice. Each site of the square
lattice has 4 nearest-neighbour exchange bonds of strength $J_{1}$ and 2
next-nearest-neighbour (diagonal) bonds of strength $J_{2}$. The $J_{2}$ bonds
are arranged so that the basic square plaquettes in alternating columns have
either both or no $J_{2}$ bonds included. The classical ($s \rightarrow
\infty$) version of the model has 4 collinear phases when $J_{1}$ and $J_{2}$
can take either sign. Three phases are antiferromagnetic (AFM), showing
so-called N\'{e}el, double N\'{e}el and double columnar striped order
respectively, while the fourth is ferromagnetic. For the quantum $s=1/2$ model
we use the 3 classical AFM phases as CCM reference states, on top of which the
multispin-flip configurations arising from quantum fluctuations are
incorporated in a systematic truncation hierarchy. Calculations of the
corresponding GS energy, magnetic order parameter and the susceptibilities of
the states to various forms of valence-bond crystalline (VBC) order are thus
carried out numerically to high orders of approximation and then extrapolated
to the (exact) physical limit. We find that the $s=1/2$ model has 5 phases,
which correspond to the four classical phases plus a new quantum phase with
plaquette VBC order. The positions of the 5 quantum critical points are
determined with high accuracy. While all 4 phase transitions in the classical
model are first order, we find strong evidence that 3 of the 5 quantum phase
transitions in the $s=1/2$ model are of continuous deconfined type.

condition as an explanation for the observed accretion disk wind signatures in
different states of low mass black hole binaries (BHB). The variability in
observed ions is conventionally explained either by variations in the driving
mechanisms or the changes in the ionizing flux or due to density effects,
whilst thermodynamic stability considerations have been largely ignored. It
would appear that the observability of particular ions in different BHB states
can be accounted for through simple thermodynamic considerations in the static
limit. Our calculations predict that in the disk dominated soft thermal and
intermediate states, the wind should be thermodynamically stable and hence
observable. On the other hand, in the powerlaw dominated spectrally hard state
the wind is found to be thermodynamically unstable for a certain range of 3.55
<= log \xi <= 4.20. In the spectrally hard state, a large number of the He-like
and H-like ions (including e.g. Fe XXV, Ar XVIII and S XV) have peak ion
fractions in the unstable ionization parameter (\xi) range, making these ions
undetectable. Our theoretical predictions have clear corroboration in the
literature reporting differences in wind ion observability as the BHBs
transition through the accretion states Lee et al. 2002; Miller et al. 2008;
Neilsen & Lee 2009; Blum et al. 2010; Ponti et al. 2012; Neilsen & Homan 2012).
While this effect may not be the only one responsible for the observed gradient
in the wind properties as a function of the accretion state in BHBs, it is
clear that its inclusion in the calculations is crucial to understanding the
link between the environment of the compact object and its accretion processes.

We evaluate the network reliability for all these graphs under a reliability
rule that is related to the expected size of a connected component. Through
these extensive simulations, we show that for positively or neutrally
assortative graphs, swapping edges to increase the number of triangles does not
increase the network reliability. Also, positively assortative graphs are more
reliable than neutral or disassortative graphs with the same number of edges.
Moreover, we show the combined effect of both assortativity-by-degree and the

qubit channel. Specifically, we consider both stabilizer and nonadditive
quantum codes. The performance of such error-correcting schemes is quantified
by means of the entanglement fidelity as a function of the damping probability
and the non-zero environmental temperature. The recovery scheme employed
throughout our work applies, in principle, to arbitrary quantum codes and is
the analogue of the perfect Knill-Laflamme recovery scheme adapted to the
approximate quantum error correction framework for the GAD error model. We also
analytically recover and/or clarify some previously known numerical results in
the limiting case of vanishing temperature of the environment, the well-known
traditional amplitude damping channel. In addition, our study suggests that
degenerate stabilizer codes and self-complementary nonadditive codes are
especially suitable for the error correction of the GAD noise model. Finally,
comparing the properly normalized entanglement fidelities of the best
performant stabilizer and nonadditive codes characterized by the same length,
we show that nonadditive codes outperform stabilizer codes not only in terms of
encoded dimension but also in terms of entanglement fidelity.

the kinetic limit, which properly accounts for the longitudinal and the small
but finite perpendicular momentum spread in the pair momentum distribution
function, the growth rate of parallel propagating electrostatic oscillations in
the intergalactic medium is calculated. Contrary to the claims of Miniati and
Elyiv (2013) we find that neither the longitudinal nor the perpendicular spread
in the relativistic pair distribution function do significantly affect the
electrostatic growth rates. The maximum kinetic growth rate for no
perpendicular spread is even about an order of magnitude greater than the
corresponding reactive maximum growth rate. The reduction factors to the
maximum growth rate due to the finite perpendicular spread in the pair
distribution function are tiny, and always less than $10^{-4}$. We confirm the
earlier conclusions by Broderick et al. (2012) and us, that the created pair
beam distribution function is quickly unstable in the unmagnetized
intergalactic medium. Therefore, there is no need to require the existence of
small intergalactic magnetic fields to scatter the produced pairs, so that the
explanation (made by several authors) of the FERMI non-detection of the inverse
Compton scattered GeV gamma rays by a finite deflecting intergalactic magnetic
field is not necessary. In particular, the various derived lower bounds for the

contrast to the traditional adiabatic connection formulation, both ensemble
weights and interaction strength can vary along a GACE path while the ensemble
density is held fixed. The theory is presented for non-degenerate two-state
ensembles but it can in principle be extended to any ensemble of fractionally
occupied excited states. Within such a formalism an exact expression for the
ensemble exchange-correlation density-functional energy, in terms of the
conventional ground-state exchange-correlation energy, is obtained by
integration over the ensemble weight. Stringent constraints on the functional
are thus obtained when expanding the ensemble exchange-correlation energy
through second order in the ensemble weight. For illustration purposes, the
analytical derivation of the GACE is presented for the H2 model system in a
minimal basis, leading thus to a simple density-functional approximation to the
ensemble exchange-correlation energy. Encouraging results were obtained with
this approximation for the description in a large basis of the first
^1\Sigma^+_g excitation in H2 upon bond stretching. Finally, a range-dependent
GACE has been derived, providing thus a pathway to the development of a

have been measured to have up to as much fluence as the original prompt
emission. Through studying large numbers of these X-ray flares it has been
determined that they likely result from a distinct emission source different
than that powering the GRB afterglow. These findings could be confirmed if
similar results were found using flares in other energy ranges. However, until
now, the UVOT instrument on Swift seemed to have observed far fewer flares in
the UV/optical than were seen in the X-ray. This was primarily due to poor
sampling and data being spread across multiple filters, but a new optimal
co-addition and normalization of the UVOT data has allowed us to search for
flares in the UV/optical that have previously gone undetected. Using a flare

knowledge. Many databases reuse existing knowledge, during the curation process
annotations are often propagated between entries. However, this is often not
made explicit. Therefore, it can be hard, potentially impossible, for a reader
to identify where an annotation originated from. Within this work we attempt to
identify annotation provenance and track its subsequent propagation.
Specifically, we exploit annotation reuse within the UniProt Knowledgebase
(UniProtKB), at the level of individual sentences. We describe a visualisation
approach for the provenance and propagation of sentences in UniProtKB which
enables a large-scale statistical analysis. Initially levels of sentence reuse
within UniProtKB were analysed, showing that reuse is heavily prevalent, which
enables the tracking of provenance and propagation. By analysing sentences
throughout UniProtKB, a number of interesting propagation patterns were
identified, covering over 100, 000 sentences. Over 8000 sentences remain in the
database after they have been removed from the entries where they originally
occurred. Analysing a subset of these sentences suggest that approximately 30%
are erroneous, whilst 35% appear to be inconsistent. These results suggest that
being able to visualise sentence propagation and provenance can aid in the
determination of the accuracy and quality of textual annotation. Source code

battery comprises a source of emf in series with an internal resistance, as
given in engineering and physics text-books, is lacking in proper explanation.
It is treated merely as an experimental fact, and not something that should
follow from logic. The battery has a tendency to maintain electric potential
difference across its terminals equal to its chemical potential, and in an open
circuit, when no current flows, these two do match. However in a closed
circuit, a drop in electric potential across the battery terminals is
inevitable for a steady flow of electric current throughout the circuit,
because the chemical reactions driving the electric current within the battery
can proceed only if the electric potential at its terminals differs from the
chemical potential. It is shown that for small voltage changes, the current
passing through the battery is linearly proportional to the change in potential
from the open-circuit value (i.e., its chemical potential), giving rise to a
semblance of an internal resistance in series with the external resistance. It
follows that a battery {\em has to have} an internal resistance in order to
function as a power source. It is also shown that Thevenin's theorem does not
make our results superfluous, in fact our results are presupposed in its
derivation.

"1309.5034","Ashok Singal","Ashok K. Singal","The Paradox of Two Charged Capacitors -- A New Perspective","13 pages, 4 figures","Phys. Education, 31, No. 4, 2 (2015)",,,"physics.class-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is shown that the famous paradox of two charged capacitors is successfully
resolved if all the energy changes in the system are properly considered when
some of the charges are transferred from one capacitor to the other. It happens
so even when the connecting wire has an identically zero resistance, giving
rise to no Ohmic losses in the wire. It is shown that in such a case the
""missing energy"" goes into the kinetic energy of conducting charges. It is
shown that radiation plays no significant role in resolving the paradox. The
problem can be formulated and successfully resolved in a novel form, where the
capacitance of the system is increased by stretching the plates of the original
capacitor, without involving any connecting wires in a circuit. There is an
outward self-force due to mutual repulsion among charges stored within each
capacitor plate, and the work done by these self-forces during an expansion is
indeed equal to the missing energy of the capacitor system.

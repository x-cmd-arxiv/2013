impurity ions, neutralizing their charge in equilibrium. Inelastic scattering
of other externally-injected conduction electrons accelerated by electric

Promotion of the bound electron into highly spin-orbit-mixed excited states
drives a strong spin relaxation of the conduction electrons via exchange
interactions, reminiscent of the Bir-Aronov-Pikus process where exchange occurs
with valence band hole states. Through low-temperature experiments with silicon
spin transport devices and complementary theory, we reveal the consequences of
this previously unknown spin depolarization mechanism both below and above the

properties for sparse diminishing-bias regularization: techniques which can
roughly be understood as providing estimation under penalty functions spanning
the range of concavity between $L_0$ and $L_1$ norms. However, lasso
$L_1$-regularized estimation remains the standard tool for industrial `Big
Data' applications because of its minimal computational cost and the presence
of easy-to-apply rules for penalty selection. In response, this article
proposes a simple new algorithm framework that requires no more computation
than a lasso path: the path of one-step estimators (POSE) does $L_1$ penalized
regression estimation on a grid of decreasing penalties, but adapts
coefficient-specific weights to decrease as a function of the coefficient
estimated in the previous path step. This provides sparse diminishing-bias
regularization at no extra cost over the fastest lasso algorithms. Moreover,
our `gamma lasso' implementation of POSE is accompanied by a reliable heuristic
for the fit degrees of freedom, so that standard information criteria can be
applied in penalty selection. We also provide novel results on the distance
between weighted-$L_1$ and $L_0$ penalized predictors; this allows us to build
intuition about POSE and other diminishing-bias regularization schemes. The
methods and results are illustrated in extensive simulations and in application
of logistic regression to evaluating the performance of hockey players.

systems perturbed by instrument-like-error, also called observational noise. An
orbit perturbed with observational noise mimics the behavior of an
instrumentally recorded time series. Instrument characteristics - defined as
precision and accuracy - act both by truncating and randomly displacing the
real value of a measured observable. Here we analyze both these effects from a
theoretical and numerical point of view. First we show that classical extreme
value laws can be found for orbits of dynamical systems perturbed with
observational noise. Then we present numerical experiments to support the
theoretical findings and give an indication of the order of magnitude of the
instrumental perturbations which cause relevant deviations from the extreme
value laws observed in deterministic dynamical systems. Finally, we show that
the observational noise preserves the structure of the deterministic attractor.
This goes against the common assumption that random transformations cause the
orbits asymptotically fill the ambient space with a loss of information about
any fractal structures present on the attractor.

implementation is usually applied to resolve this issue. In this framework,
preconditioning is typically challenging since the entries of the matrix are
not explicitly available. In this short note, we propose a statistical approach
to gradually create a preconditioner matrix by collecting the information
obtained from matrix-vector product in the Arnoldi loop of an unpreconditioned
Krylov subspace algorithm. The gathered information are then correlated using a
multiple regressors estimate where the error is assumed to be normally
distributed. This procedure yields a banded diagonal matrix which is then used
as a preconditioner in the next iterative solve. This is repeated between
iterative solves until a good preconditioner is constructed on fly. This
statistically iterative procedure is progressive since the fidelity of the
preconditioning matrix improves by adding more data obtained from matrix-vector
product during the entire solution procedure. The proposed algorithm is
validated for a sample implementation.

subdiffusive behaviour which again becomes diffusive at long times. How
pronounced and extended the different regimes are, depends on the specific

or amplitude but also the particle concentration. Here we focus on dilute
systems, but the dynamics of interacting systems in external potentials, and
thus the interplay between particle-particle and particle-potential

dilute systems resemble the dynamics of concentrated systems close to their

filament parameters (specifically, FWHM--column density relations) inconsistent
with the observations of Arzoumanian et al. (2011), except for two cases: For
low-mass, isothermal filaments, agreement is found as in the analysis by
Fischera & Martin (2012b). Magnetized cases, for which the field scales weakly
with the density as $B\propto n^{1/2}$, also reproduce observed parameters. (b)
Realistically, the filaments will be embedded not only in gas of non-zero
pressure, but also of non-zero density. Thus, the appearance of sheet-embedded

resulting column density ratios and profile shapes with observations suggests
that the three-dimensional filament profiles are intrinsically flatter than

an infinitely differentiable metric with strictly positive curvature form.
Assign to positive tensor powers of this bundle the associated product metrics
and Bergman projection operators. Zelditch has conjectured that if the Bergman
kernels, away from the diagonal, decay exponentially fast to zero as the power
tends to infinity, then the metric must be real analytic. Moreover, this is
conjectured even if exponential decay is assumed to hold merely for some
arbitrarily sparse subsequence of powers tending to infinity.
  Previously the author has constructed examples in which the metric is
infinitely differentiable, but exponential decay does not hold. These examples
are within a framework in which a certain degree of symmetry is present. In the
present paper we prove the conjecture for all structures within this framework,
thus providing evidence in favor of the conjecture. The analysis is carried out
for base manifolds of arbitrary dimensions, rather than only for dimension one

  arXiv:1202.0912",,"10.1785/0120130234",,"physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There is evidence of triggering of tremor by seismic waves emanating from
distant large earthquakes. The frequency contents of triggered and ambient
tremor are largely identical, suggesting that tremor does not depend directly
on the nature of the source. We show here that the model of plate dynamics
developed earlier by us is an appropriate tool for describing the onset of
tremor. In the framework of this model, tremor is an internal response of a
fault to a failure triggered by external disturbances. The model predicts
generation of radiation in a frequency range defined by the fault parameters.
Other specific features predicted are: the upper limit of the size of the
emitting area is a few dozen km; tremor accompanies earthquakes and aseismic
slip; the frequency content of tremor depends on the type of failure. The model
also explains why a tremor has no clear impulsive phase, in contrast to
earthquakes. A comparatively small effective normal stress (hence a high fluid
pressure) is required to make the model consistent with observed tremor
parameters. Our model indicates that tremor is not necessarily a superposition
of low frequency earthquakes, as commonly assumed, although the latter may
trigger them. The approach developed complements the conventional viewpoint
which assumes that tremor reflects a frictional process with low rupture speed.
Essentially our model adds the hypothesis that resonant-type oscillations exist
inside a fault. This addition may change our understanding of the nature of
tremor in general, and the methods of its identification and location in
particular.

clusters of galaxies in addition to the already observed relativistic leptons.
In these scenarios hadronic interactions give rise to neutral pions which decay
into $\gamma$ rays, that are potentially observable with the Large Area
Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi space telescope. We present a joint
likelihood analysis searching for spatially extended $\gamma$-ray emission at
the locations of 50 galaxy clusters in 4 years of Fermi-LAT data under the
assumption of the universal cosmic-ray model proposed by Pinzke & Pfrommer
(2010). We find an excess at a significance of $2.7\sigma$ which upon closer
inspection is however correlated to individual excess emission towards three
galaxy clusters: Abell 400, Abell 1367 and Abell 3112. We discuss these cases
in detail and conservatively attribute the emission to unmodeled background
(for example, radio galaxies within the clusters). Through the combined
analysis of 50 clusters we exclude hadronic injection efficiencies in simple
hadronic models above 21% and establish limits on the cosmic-ray to thermal
pressure ratio within the virial radius, $R_{200}$, to be below 1.2-1.4%
depending on the morphological classification. In addition we derive new limits
on the $\gamma$-ray flux from individual clusters in our sample.

development of advanced tools and techniques for digital image forgery. One of
the techniques most commonly used is the Copy-move forgery which proceeds by
copying a part of an image and pasting it into the same image, in order to
maliciously hide an object or a region. In this paper, we propose a method to
detect this specific kind of counterfeit. Firstly, the color image is converted
from RGB color space to YCbCr color space and then the R, G, B and Y-component
are splitted into fixed-size overlapping blocks and, features are extracted
from the R, G and B-components image blocks on one hand and on the other, from
the DCT representation of the R, G, B and Ycomponent image block. The feature
vectors obtained are then lexicographically sorted to make similar image blocks
neighbors and duplicated image blocks are identified using Euclidean distance
as similarity criterion. Experimental results showed that the proposed method
can detect the duplicated regions when there is more than one copy move forged
area in the image and even in case of slight rotations, JPEG compression,
shift, scale, blur and noise addition.

other massless states can mimic a dark-matter signal. However, the uncertainty
associated with measuring the mass of an invisible particle could be so large
that it is indistinguishable from a neutrino. Monte Carlo is used to estimate
lower bounds on how heavy an invisible particle must be in order for it to be
distinguishable from a massless one at 95% CL, which we estimate to be O(10
GeV). This result, to a good approximation, is independent of the way the
massive final-state particle is produced. If there is a light dark-matter

against collapse is of utmost importance for the study of the star formation
process. Only ""supercritical"" cloud fragments are able to collapse and form
stars. The virial parameter, alpha=M_vir/M, which compares the virial to the
actual mass, provides one way to gauge stability against collapse.
Supercritical cloud fragments are characterized by alpha<2, as indicated by a
comprehensive stability analysis considering perturbations in pressure and
density gradients. Past research has suggested that virial parameters alpha>2
prevail in clouds. This would suggest that collapse towards star formation is a
gradual and relatively slow process, and that magnetic fields are not needed to
explain the observed cloud structure. Here, we review a range of very recent
observational studies that derive virial parameters <<2 and compile a catalogue
of 1325 virial parameter estimates. Low values of alpha are in particular
observed for regions of high mass star formation (HMSF). These observations may
argue for a more rapid and violent evolution during collapse. This would enable
""competitive accretion"" in HMSF, constrain some models of ""monolithic
collapse"", and might explain the absence of high--mass starless cores.
Alternatively, the data could point at the presence of significant magnetic
fields ~1 mG at high gas densities. We examine to what extent the derived
observational properties might be biased by observational or theoretical
uncertainties. For a wide range of reasonable parameters, our conclusions
appear to be robust with respect to such biases.

which drive it to higher eccentricities than secular theory would otherwise
predict, resulting in substantially reduced merger times. For a uniform
distribution of tertiary eccentricity ($e_2$), ~40% of systems merge within
~1-2 eccentric KL timescales whereas secular theory predicts that only ~20% of
such systems merge that rapidly. This discrepancy becomes especially pronounced
at low $e_2$, with secular theory overpredicting the merger time by many orders
of magnitude. We show that a non-negligible fraction of systems have
eccentricity > 0.8 when they merge, in contrast to predictions from secular
theory. Our results are applicable to high mass ratio triple systems containing
black holes or neutron stars. In objects in which tidal effects are important,
such as white dwarfs, stars, and planets, REOs can reduce the tidal
circularization timescale by an order of magnitude and bring the components of

firewalls, assume approximate unitarity (""factorization of unitarity"") on each
of the decoherent spacetimes. This factorization assumption is non-trivial, and
indeed may be incorrect. We describe an ansatz for the radiation state that
violates factorization and which allows unitarity and the equivalence principle
to coexist (no firewall). Unitarity without factorization provides a natural
realization of the idea of black hole complementarity.

spaces and their algebro-geometric and motivic aspects. We consider here both
massless and massive Feynman amplitudes, from the point of view of potential
theory. We consider a variant of the wonderful compactification of
configuration spaces that works simultaneously for all graphs with a given
number of vertices and that also accounts for the external structure of Feynman
graph. As in our previous work, we consider two version of the Feynman
amplitude in configuration space, which we refer to as the real and complex
versions. In the real version, we show that we can extend to the massive case a
method of evaluating Feynman integrals, based on expansion in Gegenbauer
polynomials, that we investigated previously in the massless case. In the
complex setting, we show that we can use algebro-geometric methods to
renormalize the Feynman amplitudes, so that the renormalized values of the
Feynman integrals are given by periods of a mixed Tate motive. The
regularization and renormalization procedure is based on pulling back the form
to the wonderful compactification and replace it with a cohomologous one with
logarithmic poles. A complex of forms with logarithmic poles, endowed with an
operator of pole subtraction, determines a Rota Baxter algebra on the wonderful
compactifications. We can then apply the renormalization procedure via Birkhoff
factorization, after interpreting the regularization as an algebra homomorphism
from the Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra of Feynman graphs to the Rota-Baxter
algebra. We obtain in this setting a description of the renormalization group.
We also extend the period interpretation to the case of Dirac fermions and
gauge bosons.

sources of these particles. Following up on an earlier idea, this paper studies
the anisotropies produced by protons of energy >E/Z, assuming that anisotropies
at energy >E have been produced by nuclei of charge Z, which share the same
magnetic rigidity. We calculate the number of secondary protons produced
through photodisintegration of the primary heavy nuclei. Making the extreme
assumption that the source does not inject any proton, we find that the
source(s) responsible for anisotropies such as reported by the Pierre Auger
Observatory should lie closer than ~20-30, 80-100 and 180-200 Mpc if the
anisotropy signal is mainly composed of oxygen, silicon and iron nuclei
respectively. A violation of this constraint would otherwise result in the
secondary protons forming a more significant anisotropy signal at lower
energies. Even if the source were located closer than this distance, it would
require an extraordinary metallicity >120, 1600, 1100 times solar metallicity
in the acceleration zone of the source, for oxygen, silicon and iron
respectively, to ensure that the concomitantly injected protons not to produce
a more significant low energy anisotropy. This offers interesting prospects for
constraining the nature and the source of ultra-high energy cosmic rays with
the increase in statistics expected from next generation detectors.

all system members are T dwarfs. The system therefore constitutes the first

dependence of the L/T transition temperature on gravity, or alternatively
divergent cloud properties amongst components. Relying on empirical trends and
evolutionary models we infer a total system mass of 0.034-0.104 Msun for the BC
components at ages of 0.3-3 Gyr, which would imply a period of 12-21 yr
assuming the system semi-major axis to be similar to its projection. We also
infer differences in effective temperatures and surface gravities between

properties of the components, the 2M0838+15 system provides a controlled sample
for constraining the relative roles of effective temperature, surface gravity,

fully or partially conform. Then we consider the issue of discovering a
refinement of a sort (type) by partitioning the dataset into subsets whose
structuredness is over a specified threshold. In particular, we prove that the
natural decision problem associated to this refinement problem is NP-complete,
and we provide a natural translation of this problem into Integer Linear
Programming (ILP). Finally, we test this ILP solution with two real world
datasets, DBpedia Persons and WordNet Nouns, and 4 different and intuitive
rules, which gauge the structuredness in different ways. The rules give
meaningful refinements of the datasets, showing that our language can be a
powerful tool for understanding the structure of RDF data.

branching fractions of the SM-like Higgs to pairs of light scalars,
pseudoscalars, and neutralinos without cancellations. The strongest constraints
in both cases come from rare meson decays and exotic decays of the SM-like
Higgs boson into neutralinos and light, CP-even Higgs pairs. We outline the
relevant parameter space for both scenarios and comment on prospects for future
discovery with various experiments.

called the Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC) that can detect all forms of
statistical dependence between pairs of variables as sample size goes to
infinity. While this method has been praised by some, it has also been
criticized for its lack of power in finite samples. We seek to modify MIC so
that it has higher power in detecting associations for limited sample sizes.
Here we present the Generalized Mean Information Coefficient (GMIC), a
generalization of MIC which incorporates a tuning parameter that can be used to
modify the complexity of the association favored by the measure. We define GMIC
and prove it maintains several key asymptotic properties of MIC. Its increased
power over MIC is demonstrated using a simulation of eight different functional
relationships at sixty different noise levels. The results are compared to the
Pearson correlation, distance correlation, and MIC. Simulation results suggest
that while generally GMIC has slightly lower power than the distance
correlation measure, it achieves higher power than MIC for many forms of
underlying association. For some functional relationships, GMIC surpasses all
other statistics calculated. Preliminary results suggest choosing a moderate
value of the tuning parameter for GMIC will yield a test that is robust across
underlying relationships. GMIC is a promising new method that mitigates the
power issues suffered by MIC, at the possible expense of equitability.
Nonetheless, distance correlation was in our simulations more powerful for many
forms of underlying relationships. At a minimum, this work motivates further
consideration of maximal information-based nonparametric exploration (MINE)
methods as statistical tests of independence.

scheme requires no sub-iterations, can be made fully second- or higher-order
accurate, and remains stable even in the presence of strong added-mass effects.
The approach extends the scheme of Banks et al. [1,2] for compressible flow,
and uses Robin (mixed) boundary conditions with the fluid and solid solvers at
the interface. The AMP Robin conditions are derived from a local characteristic
decomposition in the solid at the interface. Two forms of the Robin conditions
are derived depending on whether the fluid equations are advanced with a
fractional-step method or not. A normal mode analysis for a discretization of
an FSI model problem is performed to show that the new AMP algorithm is stable
for any ratio of the solid and fluid densities, including the case of very
light solids when the added-mass effects are large. In contrast, it is shown
that a traditional partitioned algorithm involving a Dirichlet-Neumann coupling
for the same FSI problem is formally unconditionally unstable for any ratio of
densities. Exact traveling wave solutions are derived for three FSI model
problems of increasing complexity, and these solutions are used to verify the
stability and accuracy of the corresponding numerical results obtained from the
AMP algorithm for the cases of light, medium and heavy solids.

  When $C=D=A_2$, there is an infinite family of quotients interpolating

such quotients are characterized by parameters $n \geq 1$ and $\omega$ with

Hybrid Systems and Biology (HSB 2013) held in Taormina (Italy), on September
2th, 2013. The workshop is affiliated to the 12th European Conference on
Artificial Life (ECAL 2013).
  Systems biology aims at providing a system-level understanding of biological
systems by unveiling their structure, dynamics and control methods. Due to the
intrinsic multi-scale nature of these systems in space, in organization levels
and in time, it is extremely difficult to model them in a uniform way, e.g., by
means of differential equations or discrete stochastic processes. Furthermore,
such models are often not easily amenable to formal analysis, and their
simulations at the organ or even at the cell levels are frequently impractical.
Indeed, an important open problem is finding appropriate computational models
that scale well for both simulation and formal analysis of biological
processes. Hybrid modeling techniques, combining discrete and continuous
processes, are gaining more and more attention in such a context, and they have
been successfully applied to capture the behavior of many biological complex
systems, ranging from genetic networks, biochemical reactions, signaling
pathways, cardiac tissues electro-physiology, and tumor genesis. This workshop
aims at bringing together researchers in computer science, mathematics, and
life sciences, interested in the opportunities and the challenges of hybrid
modeling applied to systems biology.
  The workshop programme included the keynote presentation of Alessandro
Astolfi (Imperial College of London, UK) on Immune response enhancement via
hybrid control. Furthermore, 8 papers were selected out of 13 submissions by
the Program Committee of HSB 2013. The papers in this volume address the hybrid
modeling of a number important biological processes (iron homeostasis network,
mammalian cell cycle, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), genetic
regulatory network in mammalian sclera) and, the formalisms and techniques for
specifying and validating properties of biological systems (such as,
robustness, oscillations).

typical behavior within the framework of the local weak convergence of finite
graph sequences. The associated rate function is expressed in terms of an
entropy functional on unimodular measures and takes finite values only at
measures supported on trees. We also establish large deviations for other
commonly studied random graph ensembles such as the uniform random graph with
given number of edges growing linearly with the number of vertices, or the
uniform random graph with given degree sequence. To prove our results, we
introduce a new configuration model which allows one to sample uniform random
graphs with a given neighborhood distribution, provided the latter is supported
on trees. We also introduce a new class of unimodular random trees, which
generalizes the usual Galton Watson tree with given degree distribution to the
case of neighborhoods of arbitrary finite depth. These generalized Galton
Watson trees turn out to be useful in the analysis of unimodular random trees
and may be considered to be of interest in their own right.

mainly are composed of silicate and iron grains. Because the mass of the

is negligible. However, it is the most important that the discovery of a

based on models relating temperature to temperature-sensitive paleoclimate
proxies. One of the goals of such reconstructions is to assess if current
climate is anomalous in a millennial context. These regression based approaches
model the conditional mean of the temperature distribution as a function of
paleoclimate proxies (or vice versa). Some of the recent focus in the area has
considered methods which help reduce the uncertainty inherent in such
statistical paleoclimate reconstructions, with the ultimate goal of improving
the confidence that can be attached to such endeavors. A second important
scientific focus in the subject area is the area of forward models for proxies,
the goal of which is to understand the way paleoclimate proxies are driven by
temperature and other environmental variables. In this paper we introduce novel
statistical methodology for (1) quantile regression with autoregressive
residual structure, (2) estimation of corresponding model parameters, (3)
development of a rigorous framework for specifying uncertainty estimates of
quantities of interest, yielding (4) statistical byproducts that address the
two scientific foci discussed above. Our statistical methodology demonstrably
produces a more robust reconstruction than is possible by using
conditional-mean-fitting methods. Our reconstruction shares some of the common
features of past reconstructions, but also gains useful insights. More
importantly, we are able to demonstrate a significantly smaller uncertainty
than that from previous regression methods. In addition, the quantile
regression component allows us to model, in a more complete and flexible way
than least squares, the conditional distribution of temperature given proxies.
This relationship can be used to inform forward models relating how proxies are
driven by temperature.

estimating all post-change parameters simultaneously. Our theoretical analysis
demonstrates that the shrinkage estimation can balance the tradeoff between the

zero and weak magnetic fields by means of density matrix renormalization group
calculations of order parameters, correlation functions and the entanglement
entropy as well as an Abelian bosonization analysis. At zero magnetic field,
the bond alternation $\delta>0$ suppresses the gapless phase characterized by a
vector-chiral (VC) long-range order (LRO) and a quasi-LRO of an incommensurate
spin spiral, whereas this phase occupies a large region in the space of
$J_1/J_2$ and the easy-plane exchange anisotropy for $\delta=0$ [S. Furukawa
\textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{105}, 257205 (2010)]. Then, four
gapped phases are found to appear as the exchange anisotropy varies from the
SU(2)-symmetric case to the U(1)-symmetric case; the Haldane dimer (D$_+$)
phase with the same sign of the $x,y$- and $z$-component dimer order
parameters, two VC dimer (VCD$_+$/VCD$_-$) phases with the sign of the
$z$-component dimer order parameter being unaltered/reversed, and the
even-parity dimer (D$_-$) phase. At small magnetic fields, a field-induced
ring-exchange interaction, which is proportional to a staggered scalar
chirality and a magnetic flux penetrating the associated triangle, drives a
transition from the D$_-$ phase into a VC-Neel-dimer (VCND) phase, but not from
the D$_+$ phase. This VCND phase is stable up to the large magnetic field at
which the Zeeman term closes the spin gap. A possible relevance to
Rb$_2$Cu$_2$Mo$_3$O$_{12}$ is discussed.

isotropic diffusion source approximation scheme, which we have updated to
achieve a very high computational efficiency. All the computed models in this
work including nine 3D models and fifteen 2D models exhibit the revival of the
stalled bounce shock, leading to the possibility of explosion. All of them are
driven by the neutrino-heating mechanism, which is fostered by neutrino-driven
convection and the standing-accretion-shock instability (SASI). Reflecting the
stochastic nature of multi-dimensional (multi-D) neutrino-driven explosions,
the blast morphology changes from models to models. However, we find that the
final fate of the multi-D models whether an explosion is obtained or not, is
little affected by the explosion stochasticity. In agreement with some previous
studies, higher numerical resolutions lead to slower onset of the shock revival
in both 3D and 2D. Based on the self-consistent supernova models leading to the
possibility of explosions, our results systematically show that the revived
shock expands more energetically in 2D than in 3D.

large-scale disturbance that propagates in a narrow lane above the plasma
curtain and creates a low density region that appears as a dimming in the

non-periodic driver that interacts asymmetrically and obliquely with the top of
the plasma curtain, and triggers the observed oscillations. In the deeper

periods (795 s and 530 s). On the magnetic surface of the curtain where the
density is inhomogeneous due to the coronal dimming, non-decaying vertical

consider a modified Randall-Sundrum single brane model with two natural
generalizations: a Gauss-Bonnet term in the five-dimensional bulk action as
well as an induced gravity term in the four-dimensional brane action, which are
the leading-order corrections to the Randall-Sundrum model. We study the
influence of these combined effects on the evolution of the primordial
gravitational waves generated during an extreme slow-roll inflation on the
brane. The background, for the early inflationary era, is then modeled through
a de Sitter brane embedded within an anti-de Sitter bulk. In this framework, we
show that both effects tend to suppress the Randall-Sundrum enhancement of the
amplitude of the tensor perturbations at relatively high energies. Moreover,
the Gauss-Bonnet effect, relative to standard general relativity, will abruptly
enhance the tensor-to-scalar ratio and break the standard consistency relation
at high energies, which cannot be evaded by invoking the induced gravity
effect, even though the induced gravity strength would mildly counterbalance
these significant changes at high energies. We note that the brane-world model
with or without the induced gravity effect fulfills the consistency relation.

postive (right-handed) magnetic helicity was injected during most of the
examined time period, (2) in the flare region, there was a continuous injection
of negative (left-handed) magnetic helicity during the entire period,

flaring regions were mainly composed of emerging bipoles of magnetic fragments
in which magnetic field lines have substantially favorable conditions for
making reconnection with large-scale, overlying, and oppositely directed
magnetic field lines connecting the main sunspots. These observational findings
can also be well explained by some MHD numerical simulations for CME initiation

believed to be the forerunner event for the growth-shrinkage transition

discrete version of a stochastic model of the GTP cap dynamics, originally
proposed by Flyvbjerg, Holy and Leibler (Flyvbjerg, Holy and Leibler, Phys.
Rev. Lett. 73, 2372, 1994). Our model includes both spontaneous and vectorial
hydrolysis, as well as dissociation of a non-hydrolyzed dimer from the filament
after incorporation. In the first part of the paper, we apply this model to a
single protofilament of a microtubule. A catastrophe transition is defined for
each protofilament, similar to the earlier one-dimensional models, the
frequency of occurrence of which is then calculated under various conditions,
but without explicit assumption of steady state conditions. Using a
perturbative approach, we show that the leading asymptotic behavior of the
protofilament catastrophe in the limit of large growth velocities is remarkably
similar across different models. In the second part of the paper, we extend our
analysis to the entire filament by making a conjecture that a minimum number of
such transitions are required to occur for the onset of microtubule
catastrophe. The frequency of microtubule catastrophe is then determined using
numerical simulations, and compared with analytical/semi-analytical estimates
made under steady state/quasi-steady state assumptions respectively for the
protofilament dynamics. A few relevant experimental results are analyzed in
detail, and compared with predictions from the model. Our results indicate that
loss of GTP cap in 2-3 protofilaments is necessary to trigger catastrophe in a
microtubule.

enabled by the introduction of a novel difference-of-variables (DoV)

(Ostriker 1964) have been classically used as benchmark to interpret the
stability of the filaments observed in nearby clouds. However, recent continuum
studies have shown that the internal structure of the filaments depart from the
isothermality, typically exhibiting radially increasing temperature gradients.
The presence of internal temperature gradients within filaments suggests that
the equilibrium configuration of these objects should be therefore revisited.
The main goal of this work is to theoretically explore how the equilibrium
structure of a filament changes in a non-isothermal configuration. We solve the
hydrostatic equilibrium equation assuming temperature gradients similar to
those derived from observations. We obtain a new set of equilibrium solutions
for non-isothermal filaments with both linear and asymptotically constant
temperature gradients. Our results show that, for sufficiently large internal
temperature gradients, a non-isothermal filament could present significantly
larger masses per unit length and shallower density profiles than the
isothermal filament without collapsing by its own gravity. We conclude that
filaments can reach an equilibrium configuration under non-isothermal
conditions. Detailed studies of both the internal mass distribution and
temperature gradients within filaments are then needed in order to judge the
physical state of filaments.

an M-type giant and probably a neutron star (NS). We detected the 0.8-50 keV
signal with the XIS and HXD-PIN. The 2-10 keV luminosity was L ~ 7 x 10^34 erg
s^-1 corresponding to ~10^-3 L_Edd, where L_Edd is the Eddington Luminosity of
a 1.4 M_o NS and a source distance of 3.7 kpc is assumed. The luminosity is
similar to those of past observations. The spectral analysis showed that there
are two emission components below and above ~2 keV. The hard emission component
is represented by a Comptonized black-body emission model with the seed-photon
temperature ~1.0 keV and the emission radius ~700 m. The seed photon is
considered to come from a small fraction of the NS surface. The soft component
is reproduced by either a raw black-body (~0.4 keV, ~1.7 km) or a Comptonized
emission (~0.1 keV, ~75 km). We think the origin is the emission from other
part of the NS surface or the accreting stream. The physical parameters of the
hard emission component of IGR J16194-2810 are compared with those of an SyXB

excess emission of varying strength in the $0.1-2\kev$ band whose origin is

characterized by a multi-carrier interference channel system model where the
interference is treated as noise. For these systems, spectrum optimization is a
promising means to mitigate interference. This however corresponds to a
challenging nonconvex optimization problem. Existing iterative convex
approximation (ICA) methods consist in solving a series of improving convex
approximations and are typically implemented in a per-user iterative approach.
However they do not take this typical iterative implementation into account in
their design. This paper proposes a novel class of iterative approximation
methods that focuses explicitly on the per-user iterative implementation, which
allows to relax the problem significantly, dropping joint convexity and even
convexity requirements for the approximations. A systematic design framework is
proposed to construct instances of this novel class, where several new
iterative approximation methods are developed with improved per-user convex and
nonconvex approximations that are both tighter and simpler to solve (in
closed-form). As a result, these novel methods display a much faster
convergence speed and require a significantly lower computational cost.
Furthermore, a majority of the proposed methods can tackle the issue of getting
stuck in bad locally optimal solutions, and hence improve solution quality
compared to existing ICA methods.

is 6-7% in the central region (r<90"") and slightly lower (5.5%) in the
outskirts, at r>200"". Quite interestingly, the comparison with the results of
Milone et al. (2012) suggests that also binary systems may display a bimodal
radial distribution, with the position of the minimum consistent with that of
blue straggler stars. If confirmed, this feature would give additional support
to the scenario where the radial distribution of objects more massive than the
average cluster stars is primarily shaped by the effect of dynamical friction.
Moreover, this would also be consistent with the idea that the unperturbed
evolution of primordial binaries could be the dominant BSS formation process in
low-density environments.

This effect is re-evaluated using the ground-state contributions to the stellar

excited state contributions than the previously applied SEFs. An update of the

reaction Q-value than in the exothermic direction, thus providing exceptions to
the commonly applied Q-value rule. The results confirm the Coulomb suppression

due to the fact that often a large variation in the g.s. contribution does not
lead to a sizeable change in the SEF. On the other hand, several previously
identified cases do not appear anymore because it is found that their g.s.

these same properties can also lead to its toxicity in overload through the
production of reactive oxygen species. Robust systemic and cellular control are
required to maintain safe levels of iron and the liver seems to be where this
regulation is mainly located. Iron misregulation is implicated in many diseases
and as our understanding of iron metabolism improves the list of iron-related
disorders grows. Recent developments have resulted in greater knowledge of the
fate of iron in the body and have led to a detailed map of its metabolism,
however a quantitative understanding at the systems level of how its components
interact to produce tight regulation remains elusive.
  A mechanistic computational model of human liver iron metabolism, which
includes the core regulatory components, was constructed based on known
mechanisms of regulation and on their kinetic properties, obtained from several
publications. The model was then quantitatively validated by comparing its
results with previously published physiological data, and it is able to
reproduce multiple experimental findings. A time course simulation following an
oral dose of iron was compared to a clinical time course study and the
simulation was found to recreate the dynamics and time scale of the systems
response to iron challenge. A disease simulation of haemochromatosis was
created by altering a single reaction parameter that mimics a human
haemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutation. The simulation provides a quantitative
understanding of the liver iron overload that arises in this disease.
  This model supports and supplements understanding of the role of the liver as
an iron sensor and provides a framework for further modelling, including
simulations to identify valuable drug targets and design of experiments to
improve further our knowledge of this system.

smaller (larger) slope than configurational adiabats. We clarify also the
connection between $\gamma$ and the pair potential. A fluctuation formula for
the slope of the $C_V$-contours is derived. The theoretical results are

the key challenges in emerging wireless small cell networks whose backhaul is

paper, a novel, backhaul-aware approach to interference management in wireless

equipments (MUEs) to optimize their uplink performance, by exploiting the
presence of neighboring small cell base stations. The problem is formulated as
a noncooperative game among the MUEs that seek to optimize their delay-rate
tradeoff, given the conditions of both the radio access network and the --
possibly heterogeneous -- backhaul. To solve this game, a novel, distributed
learning algorithm is proposed using which the MUEs autonomously choose their
optimal uplink transmission strategies, given a limited amount of available
information. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is shown and its
properties are studied. Simulation results show that, under various types of
backhauls, the proposed approach yields significant performance gains, in terms
of both average throughput and delay for the MUEs, when compared to existing
benchmark algorithms.

was foot pain which only 19% responded positively to it. There are significant

through linear regression which showed that a unit change in computer will
result in corresponding 1.76 unit increases in RSI and a unit change in

The need to adequately model individuals' interactions with other group members
has been recognised, particularly in order to differentiate the role of social
forces in individual movement from environmental factors. However, to date,
practical statistical methods which can include group dynamics in animal
movement models have been lacking. We consider a flexible modelling framework
that distinguishes a group-level model, describing the movement of the group's
centre, and an individual-level model, such that each individual makes its
movement decisions relative to the group centroid. The basic idea is framed
within the flexible class of hidden Markov models, extending previous work on
modelling animal movement by means of multi-state random walks. While in
simulation experiments parameter estimators exhibit some bias in non-ideal
scenarios, we show that generally the estimation of models of this type is both
feasible and ecologically informative. We illustrate the approach using real
movement data from 11 reindeer (Rangifer tarandus). Results indicate a
directional bias towards a group centroid for reindeer in an encamped state.
Though the attraction to the group centroid is relatively weak, our model
successfully captures group-influenced movement dynamics. Specifically, as
compared to a regular mixture of correlated random walks, the group dynamic
model more accurately predicts the non-diffusive behaviour of a cohesive mobile
group.

(z=0.35) is known to exhibit a misalignment of its radio jets and lobes
observed at different VLA-scale, with the innermost kpc-scale jets being almost
orthogonal to the radio emission which extends for tens of kpc filling the
X-ray cavities. Gitti et al. suggested that this peculiar radio morphology may
indicate a recurrent activity of the central radio source, where the jet
orientation is changing between the different outbursts due to the effects of
supermassive binary black holes (SMBBHs). We aim at unveiling the nuclear radio
properties of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) in RBS 797 and at
investigating the presence of a SMBBH system in its center. We have performed
new high-resolution observations at 5 GHz with the European VLBI Network (EVN),
reaching an angular resolution of 9x5 mas^2 and a sensitivity of 36
microJy/beam. We report the EVN detection of two compact components in the BCG
of RBS 797, with a projected separation of ~77 pc. We can envisage two possible
scenarios: the two components are two different nuclei in a close binary
system, or they are the core and a knot of its jet. Both interpretations are
consistent with the presence of SMBBHs. Our re-analysis of VLA archival data
seems to favor the first scenario, as we detect two pairs of radio jets
misaligned by ~90 degrees on the same kpc scale emanating from the central
radio core. If the two outbursts are almost contemporaneous, this is clear
evidence of the presence of two active SMBHs, whose radio nuclei are unresolved
at VLA resolution. The nature of the double source detected by our EVN
observations in the BCG of RBS 797 can be established only by future sensitive,
multi-frequency VLBI observations. If confirmed, RBS 797 would be the first
SMBBH system observed at medium-high redshift at VLBI resolution. (abridged)

physics down to the event horizon. Recent work has used frequency and
energy-dependent time lags as a tool for studying relativistic reverberation
around the black holes in several Seyfert galaxies. This was achieved thanks to
the evenly-sampled light curves obtained using XMM-Newton. Continuous-sampled
data is however not always available and standard Fourier techniques are not
applicable. Here, building on the work of Miller et al. (2010), we discuss and
use a maximum likelihood method to obtain frequency-dependent lags that takes
into account light curve gaps. Instead of calculating the lag directly, the
method estimates the most likely lag values at a particular frequency given two
observed light curves. We use Monte Carlo simulations to assess the method's
applicability, and use it to obtain lag-energy spectra from Suzaku data for two
objects, NGC 4151 and MCG-5-23-16, that had previously shown signatures of iron
K reverberation. The lags obtained are consistent with those calculated using
standard methods using XMM-Newton data.

vacua and quark and gluino condensates in these vacua are found.
  The mass spectra of the direct and Seiberg's dual theories in various vacua
are calculated within the dynamical scenario which assumes that quarks in such
${\cal N}=1$ SQCD-like theories can be in two {\it standard} phases only. These
are either the HQ (heavy quark) phase where they are confined or the Higgs
phase. The word {\it standard} implies here also that, in such ${\cal N}=1$
theories without elementary colored adjoint scalars, no {\it additional}
parametrically light solitons (e.g. magnetic monopoles or dyons) are formed at
those scales where quarks decouple as heavy or are higgsed. Recall that this
scenario satisfies all those tests which were used as checks of the Seiberg
hypothesis about the equivalence of the direct and dual theories.
  The mass spectra of these direct and Seiberg's dual theories calculated
within this framework were found to be different, in general. These
parametrical differences of mass spectra of direct and dual theories show, in
particular, that all those tests, which were used as checks of the Seiberg
hypothesis about the equivalence of the direct and dual theories, although
necessary, may well be insufficient.
  Besides, the mass spectrum of the dual theory with $SU(N_F-N_c)$ colors and
$N_c+1<N_F<3N_c/2$ dual quark flavors was calculated.
  And finally, considered is the direct ${\cal N}=2$ SQCD with $SU(N_c)$ colors

comparing CMB measurements and SZ cluster counts. A consistent picture emerges
and including a prior for the cluster constraints and BAOs we find that: for an
active neutrino model with 3 degenerate neutrinos, $\sum m_{\nu}= (0.320 \pm

analysis of complex statistical problems. However, their computational
efficiency is highly dependent on the chosen proposal distribution, which is
generally difficult to find. One way to solve this problem is to use adaptive
MCMC algorithms which automatically tune the statistics of a proposal
distribution during the MCMC run. A new adaptive MCMC algorithm, called the
variational Bayesian adaptive Metropolis (VBAM) algorithm, is developed. The
VBAM algorithm updates the proposal covariance matrix using the variational
Bayesian adaptive Kalman filter (VB-AKF). A strong law of large numbers for the
VBAM algorithm is proven. The empirical convergence results for three simulated
examples and for two real data examples are also provided.

Spaces I, 1969) as spaces equipped with point reflections depending on a point
and fixing this point; therefore the theories of Jordan geometries and of
symmetric spaces are closely related to each other -- in order to describe this
link, the notion of symmetry actions of torsors and of symmetric spaces is
introduced. Jordan geometries give rise both to symmetry actions of certain
abelian torsors and of certain symmetric spaces, which in a sense are dual to

classical Weil functors (see arxiv:1402.2619), we attach a tangent object to

present approach works equally well over base rings in which 2 is not

analyzed in a general way, for the diagonal and off-diagonal couplings, of

(Majorana) particles. The restrictions imposed by common principles such as
electromagnetic gauge invariance and hermiticity are studied, and the
implications due to the discrete space-time symmetries or the Majorana
condition are deduced when they are applicable. In some cases certain features
of the vertex function are analogous to the known ones for the spin-1/2 or
spin-1 particles, but we find and discuss other particular properties which are
related to the spin-3/2 Rarita-Schwinger representation. For example, in the
diagonal Majorana case, the vertex function can contain a term of the form
$\gamma_\mu\gamma_5$, which resembles the axial charge radius term for Majorana
neutrinos, plus another one that resembles the vertex function for
self-conjugate spin-1 particles, but with the particularity that the two terms
may not appear independently of each other, but instead with a specific
relative coefficient. In essence this is due to the requirement that the vertex
function does not mix the genuine spin-3/2 degrees of freedom with the spurious
spin-1/2 components of the Rarita-Schwinger representation. The analogous
results for the other cases (off-diagonal and charged couplings) are discussed

  First, we present four validation tests: spectra from simulations of thermal
plasmas, linear growth rates of the relativistic tearing instability and of the
filamentation instability, and non-linear filamentation merging phase. For the
filamentation instability we show that the effective growth rates measured on
the total energy can differ by more than 50% from the linear cold predictions
and from the fastest modes of the simulation.
  Second, we detail a new method for initial loading of Maxwell-J\""uttner
particle distributions with relativistic bulk velocity and relativistic
temperature, and explain why the traditional method with individual particle
boosting fails.
  Third, we scrutinize the question of what description of physical plasmas is
obtained by PIC models. These models rely on two building blocks:
coarse-graining, i.e., grouping of the order of p~10^10 real particles into a
single computer superparticle, and field storage on a grid with its subsequent
finite superparticle size. We introduce the notion of coarse-graining dependent
quantities, i.e., quantities depending on p. They derive from the PIC plasma
parameter Lambda^{PIC}, which we show to scale as 1/p. We explore two
implications. One is that PIC collision- and fluctuation-induced thermalization
times are expected to scale with the number of superparticles per grid cell,
and thus to be a factor p~10^10 smaller than in real plasmas. The other is that
the level of electric field fluctuations scales as 1/Lambda^{PIC} ~ p. We
provide a corresponding exact expression.

fluid with infinite Lambda, to the PIC model and its relatively small Lambda.

Particle (WIMP). Six representative building blocks of SD operators, together
with their counterparts with a massless mediator are considered to interpret
the direct detection experiments(Xenon100, SIMPLE, and COUPP) in a
comprehensive way. We also study the solar capture and annihilation of WIMPs
with these effective SD operators and place the constraints on the relevant
annihilation rate from neutrino detection experiments Super-Kamionkande and
IceCube. Upper limits on the WIMP-nucleon couplings drawn from direct
detections are also projected to the annihilation rate for contrast and
complementarity. We find that the efficiency of these mentioned detection
strategies depends specifically on the six SD operators, while the
neutrino-based detections are more effective in exploring the parameter space
for the massless mediator scenario.

Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory. Our inspiration comes on the one hand from a
corresponding upper bound for the area in terms of the charges obtained
recently by Dain, Jaramillo and Reiris [1] in the pure Einstein-Maxwell case
without symmetries, and on the other hand from Yazadjiev's inequality [2] in
the axially symmetric Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton case. The common issue in these
proofs and in the present one is a functional ${\mathscr W}$ of the matter
fields for which the stability condition readily yields an {\it upper} bound.
On the other hand, the step which crucially depends on whether or not a dilaton
field is present is to obtain a {\it lower} bound for ${\mathscr W}$ as well.
We obtain the latter by first setting up a variational principle for ${\mathscr
W}$ with respect to the dilaton field $\phi$, then by proving existence of a
minimizer $\psi$ as solution of the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations and
finally by estimating ${\mathscr W}(\psi)$. In the special case that the normal
components of the electric and magnetic fields are proportional we obtain the
area bound $A \ge 8\pi P Q$ in terms of the electric and magnetic charges. In
the generic case our results are less explicit but imply rigorous
`perturbation' results for the above inequality. All our inequalities are
saturated for a 2-parameter family of static, extreme solutions found by
Gibbons [3]. Via the Bekenstein-Hawking relation $A = 4S$ our results give
positive lower bounds for the entropy $S$ which are particularly interesting in
the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton case.

clusters (GCs) are expected to be one the brightest sources of gravitational
wave (GW) radiation for the next generation of ground-based laser
interferometers. Favorable conditions for merger are initiated by the Kozai
resonance in which the gravitational interaction with a third distant object,
typically another BH, induces quasi-periodic variations of the inner BH binary
eccentricity. In this paper we perform high precision N-body simulations of the
long term evolution of hierarchical BH triples and investigate the conditions
that lead to the merging of the BH binary and the way it might become an
observable source of GW radiation. We find that the secular orbit average
treatment, adopted in previous works, does not reliably describe the dynamics
of these systems if the binary is orbited by the outer BH on a highly inclined
orbit at a moderate distance. During the high eccentricity phase of a Kozai
cycle the torque due to the outer BH can drive the binary to extremely large
eccentricities in a fraction of the binary's orbital period. This occurs before
relativistic terms become important to the evolution and allows the binary GW
signal to reach large GW frequencies (>~10 Hz) at high eccentricities. We show
that ~50 % of coalescing BH binaries driven by the Kozai mechanism in GCs will
have eccentricities larger than 0.1, with 10 % of them being extremely
eccentric, (1-e)<~10^-5, when they first chirp in the frequency band of ground
based laser interferometers. This implies that a large fraction of such GW
sources could be missed if conventional quasi-circular templates are used for
analysis of GW detectors data. The efficient detection of all coalescing BH
binaries in GCs will therefore require template banks of eccentric inspiral
waveforms for matched-filtering and dedicated search strategies.

background linearly polarized CO emission interacts with similar foreground

quantify the influence of the magnetic field in both the oscillation frequency
$\sigma_r$ of the r-modes and the growth time $t_{gw}$ of the gravitational
radiation emission. We conclude that magnetic fields of the order $10^{15}$ G
at the center of the star are necessary to produce any changes. Our results for
$\sigma_r$ show a decrease of up to $\sim$ $5\%$ in the frequency with
increasing magnetic field, with a $B^2$ dependence for rotation rates
$\Omega/\Omega_K \gtrsim 0.07$ and $B^4$ for $\Omega/\Omega_K \lesssim 0.07$.
(These results should be trusted only within slow rotation approximation and we
kept $\Omega/\Omega_{K}< 0.3$.) For $t_{gw}$, we find that it is approximately
$30\%$ smaller than previous Newtonian results for non-magnetized stars, which
would mean a faster growth of the emission of gravitational radiation. The
effect of the magnetic field in $t_{gw}$ causes a non-monotonic effect, that
first slightly increases $t_{gw}$ and then decreases it further by another
$\sim$ $5\%$. (The value of magnetic field for which $t_{gw}$ starts to
decrease depends on the rotational frequency, but it is generally around
$10^{15}$G.) Future work should be dedicated to the study of the effect of
viscosity in the presence of magnetic fields, in order to establish the

(1) novelty search with local competition, which searches for both

cancer patients identified in multiple databases, we proposed that late
relapses result from steady stochastic progressions from single dormant

However in order to explain early relapses, we had to postulate that something
happens at about the time of surgery to provoke sudden exits from dormant
phases to active growth and then to detection. Most relapses in breast cancer
are in the early category. Recent data from Forget et al suggests an unexpected
mechanism. They retrospectively studied results from 327 consecutive breast
cancer patients comparing various perioperative analgesics and anesthetics in
one Belgian hospital and one surgeon. Patients were treated with mastectomy and
conventional adjuvant therapy. Relapse hazard updated Sept 2011 are presented.
A common Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) analgesic used in surgery
produced far superior disease-free survival in the first 5 years after surgery.
The expected prominent early relapse events in months 9-18 are reduced 5-fold.
If this observation holds up to further scrutiny, it could mean that the simple
use of this safe, inexpensive and effective anti-inflammatory agent at surgery
might eliminate early relapses. Transient systemic inflammation accompanying
surgery could facilitate angiogenesis of dormant micrometastases, proliferation
of dormant single cells, and seeding of circulating cancer stem cells (perhaps
in part released from bone marrow) resulting in early relapse and could have
been effectively blocked by the perioperative anti-inflammatory agent.

neutron stars, the quark-gluon plasma, and superfluid liquid helium, requires
investigation of systems that are clean, accessible, and have tunable
parameters. Ultracold quantum gases offer tremendous promise for this
application largely due to an unprecedented control over interactions.
Specifically, $a$, the two-body scattering length that characterizes the
interaction strength, can be tuned to any value. This offers prospects for
experimental access to regimes where the behavior is not well understood
because interactions are strong, atom-atom correlations are important,
mean-field theory is inadequate, and equilibrium may not be reached or perhaps
does not even exist. Of particular interest is the unitary gas, where $a$ is
infinite, and where many aspects of the system are universal in that they
depend only on the particle density and quantum statistics. While the unitary
Fermi gas has been the subject of intense experimental and theoretical
investigation, the degenerate unitary Bose gas has generally been deemed
experimentally inaccessible because of three-body loss rates that increase
dramatically with increasing $a$. Here, we investigate dynamics of a unitary
Bose gas for timescales that are short compared to the loss. We find that the
momentum distribution of the unitary Bose gas evolves on timescales fast
compared to losses, and that both the timescale for this evolution and the
limiting shape of the momentum distribution are consistent with universal
scaling with density. This work demonstrates that a unitary Bose gas can be
created and probed dynamically, and thus opens the door for further exploration
of this novel strongly interacting quantum liquid.

physical solutions of the fifth force in high density regions, which prevents
the study of structure formation in this model. For the Quartic model, we show
that the effective gravitational strength deviates from unity at late times ($z
\lesssim 1$), becoming larger if the density is low, but smaller if the density
is high. This shows that the Vainshtein mechanism at high densities is not
enough to screen all of the modifications of gravity. This makes halos that
collapse at $z \lesssim 1$ feel an overall weaker gravity, which suppresses
halo formation. However, the matter density in the Quartic model is higher than
in standard $\Lambda$CDM, which boosts structure formation and dominates over
the effect of the weaker gravity. In the Quartic model there is a significant
overabundance of high-mass halos relative to $\Lambda$CDM. Dark matter halos
are also less biased than in $\Lambda$CDM, with the difference increasing

such 3d/5d double perovskites, strong correlations on the 5d-element (Re) are
essential in driving a half-metallic ground state. Incorporating both strong
spin-orbit coupling and the Hubbard repulsion on Re leads to a band structure

of the saturation magnetization of Ba2FeReO6, as well as X-ray magnetic

Finally, the combination of a net magnetization and spin-orbit interactions is
shown to induce Weyl nodes in the band structure, and we predict a significant

interplay of strong correlations and spin-orbit coupling lends partial support

ratio in the circumstellar environment, carrying important information about
the stellar nucleosynthesis. External processes can change the 12CO and 13CO
abundances, and spatially resolved studies of the 12CO/13CO ratio are needed to
quantify the effect of these processes on the globally determined values.
Additionally, such studies provide important information on the conditions in
the circumstellar environment. The detached-shell source R Scl, displaying CO
emission from recent mass loss, in a binary-induced spiral structure as well as
in a clumpy shell produced during a thermal pulse, provides a unique laboratory
for studying the differences in CO isotope abundances throughout its recent
evolution. We observed both the 12CO(J=3-2) and the 13CO(J=3-2) line using
ALMA. We find significant variations in the 12CO/13CO intensity ratios and
consequently in the abundance ratios. The average CO isotope abundance ratio is
at least a factor three lower in the shell (~19) than that in the present-day
(<300 years) mass loss (>60). Additionally, variations in the ratio of more
than an order of magnitude are found in the shell itself. We attribute these
variations to the competition between selective dissociation and isotope
fractionation in the shell, of which large parts cannot be warmer than ~35 K.
However, we also find that the 12CO/13CO ratio in the present-day mass loss is
significantly higher than the 12C/13C ratio determined in the stellar
photosphere from molecular tracers (~19). The origin of this discrepancy is
still unclear, but we speculate that it is due to an embedded source of
UV-radiation that is primarily photo-dissociating 13CO. This radiation source
could be the hitherto hidden companion. Alternatively, the UV-radiation could
originate from an active chromosphere of R Scl itself....

predict these features in one of two different flavors: logarithmically spaced
oscillations and linearly spaced oscillations. The proposed method treats the
oscillations as perturbations on top of the scale-invariant power spectrum,
allowing us to vary all cosmological parameters. This perturbative approach
reduces the computational requirements for the search as the transfer functions
and their derivatives can be precomputed. We show that the most significant
degeneracy in the analysis is between the distance to last scattering and the
overall amplitude at low frequencies. For models with logarithmic oscillations,
this degeneracy leads to an uncertainty in the phase. For linear spaced
oscillations, it affects the frequency of the oscillations. In this first of
two papers, we test our code on simulated Planck-like data, and show we are
able to recover fiducial input oscillations with an amplitude of a few times
order 10^{-2}. We apply the code to WMAP9-year data and confirm the existence
of two intriguing resonant frequencies for log spaced oscillations. For linear
spaced oscillations we find a single resonance peak. We use numerical
simulations to assess the significance of these features and conclude that the
data do not provide compelling evidence for the existence of oscillatory
features in the primordial spectrum.

weaken with more data. With more accurate small scale measurements, we also
find that the best fit frequency has shifted and the amplitude has been
reduced. We confirm the presence of a several low frequency peaks, earlier
identified by the Planck team, but with a better improvement of fit (delta
chi^2 ~ 12). We further investigate this improvement by allowing the lensing
potential to vary as well, showing mild correlation between the amplitude of
the oscillations and the lensing amplitude. We find that the improvement of the
fit increases even more (delta chi^2 ~ 14) for the low frequencies that modify
the spectrum in a way that mimics the lensing effect. Since these features were
not present in the WMAP data, they are primarily due to better measurements of
Planck at small angular scales. For linear spaced oscillations we find a
maximum delta chi^2 ~ 13 scanning two orders of magnitude in frequency space,
and the biggest improvements are at extremely high frequencies. We recover a
best fit frequency very close to the one found in WMAP9, which confirms that
the fit improvement is driven by low l. Further comparisons with WMAP9 show
Planck contains many more features, both for linear and log space oscillations,
but with a smaller improvement of fit. We discuss the improvement as a function
of the number of modes and study the effect of the 217 GHz map, which appears
to drive most of the improvement for log spaced oscillations. We conclude that
none of the detected features are statistically significant.

Moreover, amongst the galaxies that host an AGN, the black hole accretion rates

Area Telescope (LAT) on-board Fermi in 2011 June-July when it underwent a
period of flaring activity. Since then, as Fermi continues to accumulate data
on this source, its flux has been monitored on a daily basis. Two further
gamma-ray flaring episodes from SBS 0846+513 were observed in 2012 May and
August, reaching a daily peak flux integrated above 100 MeV of (50+/-12)x10^-8

complex connection with the gamma-ray activity. The most likely scenario

radio activity observed over the same period, while the two gamma-ray flaring
episodes may be related to the radio activity observed at 15 GHz in 2012
October and 2013 January. The gamma-ray flare in 2012 May triggered Swift
observations that confirmed that SBS 0846+513 was also exhibiting high activity
in the optical, UV and X-ray bands, thus providing a firm identification
between the gamma-ray source and the lower-energy counterpart. We compared the
spectral energy distribution (SED) of the flaring state in 2012 May with that
of a quiescent state. The two SEDs, modelled as an external Compton component
of seed photons from a dust torus, could be fitted by changing the electron
distribution parameters as well as the magnetic field. No significant evidence
of thermal emission from the accretion disc has been observed. Interestingly,
in the 5 GHz radio luminosity vs. synchrotron peak frequency plot SBS 0846+513
seems to lie in the flat spectrum radio quasar part of the so-called `blazar

incorporate dependence on macroion density and excluded volume via the Debye
screening constant. The volume energy, which depends on the average macroion
density, contributes to the free energy and so can influence thermodynamic
properties of deionized suspensions. To validate the theory, we compute radial
distribution functions of binary mixtures of oppositely charged colloidal
macroions from molecular dynamics simulations of the coarse-grained model (with
implicit microions), taking effective pair potentials as input. Our results
agree closely with corresponding results from more computationally intensive
Monte Carlo simulations of the primitive model (with explicit microions).

used in order to contract the Duhamel terms that occur in the study of the
hierarchy. In the averaged estimate, we do not need to integrate in the time
variable. An averaged spacetime estimate for this range of regularity exponents
then follows as a direct corollary. The range of regularity exponents that we
obtain is $\alpha>\frac{3}{4}$. It was shown in our previous joint work with
Gressman that the range $\alpha>1$ is sharp in the corresponding deterministic
spacetime estimate. This is in contrast to the non-periodic setting, which was
studied by Klainerman and Machedon, in which the spacetime estimate is known to
hold whenever $\alpha \geq 1$. The goal of our paper is to extend the range of
$\alpha$ in this class of estimates in a \emph{probabilistic sense}.
  We use the new estimate and the ideas from its proof in order to study
randomized forms of the Gross-Pitaevskii hierarchy. More precisely, we consider
hierarchies similar to the Gross-Pitaevskii hierarchy, but in which the
collision operator has been randomized. For these hierarchies, we show
convergence to zero in low regularity Sobolev spaces of Duhamel expansions of

key question in correlated electron systems, whose resolution is needed to
elucidate the phase diagram of copper oxides. Recent resonant inelastic X-ray
scattering (RIXS) experiments in hole-doped cuprates have purported to measure
high-energy collective spin excitations that persist well into the overdoped
regime and bear a striking resemblance to those found in the parent compound,
challenging the perception that spin excitations should weaken with doping and
have a diminishing effect on superconductivity. Here we show that RIXS at the
Cu L3-edge indeed provides access to the spin dynamical structure factor once
one considers the full influence of light polarization. Further we demonstrate
that high-energy spin excitations do not correlate with the doping dependence
of Tc, while low-energy excitations depend sensitively on doping and show
ferromagnetic correlations. This suggests that high-energy spin excitations are
marginal to pairing in cuprate superconductors.

have mass-ratios of 1:1 to 6:1 and include pre-existing hot gaseous halos to
properly account for the global impact of AGN feedback. Using smoothed particle
hydrodynamics simulation code (GADGET-3) we compare three models with different
AGN feedback models: (1) no black hole and no AGN feedback; (2) thermal AGN
feedback; and (3) mechanical and radiative AGN feedback. The last model is
motivated by observations of broad line quasars which show winds with initial
velocities of $v_w \ge$ 10,000 km/s and also heating associated with the
central AGN X-ray radiation. The primary changes in gas properties due to
mechanical AGN feedback are lower thermal X-ray luminosity from the final
galaxy - in better agreement with observations - and galactic outflows with
higher velocity $\sim 1000$ km/s similar to recent direct observations of
nearby merger remnants. The kinetic energy of the outflowing gas is a factor of
$\sim$ 20 higher than in the thermal feedback case. All merger remnants with
momentum-based AGN feedback with $v_w \sim 10,000$ km/s and $\epsilon_w=2
\times 10^{-3}$, independent of their progenitor mass-ratios, reproduce the
observed relations between stellar velocity dispersion and black hole mass
($M_{\rm bh} - \sigma$) as well as X-ray luminosity ($L_X - \sigma$) with
$10^{37.5}$ erg/s $\lesssim L_X (0.3-8~{\rm keV}) \lesssim 10^{39.2}$ erg/s for
velocity dispersions in the range of 120 km/s $\lesssim \sigma \lesssim$ 190
km/s. In addition, the mechanical feedback produces a much greater AGN
variability. We also show that gas is more rapidly and impulsively stripped
from the galactic centres driving a moderate increase in galaxy size and
decrease in central density with the mechanical AGN feedback model.

high redshift provides a strong probe of star formation history in the early
universe. While hundreds of GRBs are observed by Swift, it remains difficult to
determine the intrinsic GRB rate due to the complex trigger algorithm of Swift.
Current studies usually approximate the Swift trigger algorithm by a single
detection threshold. However, unlike the previously flown GRB instruments,
Swift has over 500 trigger criteria based on photon count rate and additional
image threshold for localization. To investigate possible systematic biases and
explore the intrinsic GRB properties, we developed a program that is capable of
simulating all the rate trigger criteria and mimicking the image trigger
threshold. We use this program to search for the intrinsic GRB rate. Our
simulations show that adopting the complex trigger algorithm of Swift increases
the detection rate of dim bursts. As a result, we find that either the GRB rate
is much higher than previously expected at large redshift, or the luminosity
evolution is non-negligible. We will discuss the best results of the GRB rate

Endothelial morphogenesis depends on a large number of chemical and mechanical
factors, including the compliancy of the extracellular matrix, the available
growth factors, the adhesion of cells to the extracellular matrix, cell-cell
signaling, etc. Although various computational models have been proposed to
explain the role of each of these biochemical and biomechanical effects, the
understanding of the mechanisms underlying in vitro angiogenesis is still
incomplete. Most explanations focus on predicting the whole vascular network or
sprout from the underlying cell behavior, and do not check if the same model
also correctly captures the intermediate scale: the pairwise cell-cell
interactions or single cell responses to ECM mechanics. Here we show, using a
hybrid cellular Potts and finite element computational model, that a single set
of biologically plausible rules describing (a) the contractile forces that
endothelial cells exert on the ECM, (b) the resulting strains in the
extracellular matrix, and (c) the cellular response to the strains, suffices
for reproducing the behavior of individual endothelial cells and the
interactions of endothelial cell pairs in compliant matrices. With the same set
of rules, the model also reproduces network formation from scattered cells, and
sprouting from endothelial spheroids. Combining the present mechanical model

a more complete understanding of in vitro angiogenesis.

condensed matter research of late. This elusive particle, predicted to exist in
1937, has been sought after for both fundamental and practical reasons. On the
fundamental level, no particle to date has been observed to be a Majorana
fermion, meanwhile on the practical level a Majorana fermion, if found, would
represent a non-abelian anyon and could thus be used to build a quantum
computer. The search for a Majorana Fermion has recently shifted to topological
superconductivity. Topological superconductors are categorized by the
nontrivial wind- ing of their order parameter phase and for this reason are
expected to support Majorana Fermions in their vortex cores. Owing to this, the
study of topological superconductors has intensified in recent years. Current
proposals for a device that may behave as a topological superconductor are
based on semiconductor heterostructures, where the spin-orbit coupled bands of
a semiconductor are split by a band gap or Zeeman field and superconductivity
is induced by proximity to a conventional superconductor. In this setup,
topological superconductivity is obtained in the semiconductor layer and the
proposed heterostructures typically include two or three layers of different
materials. In this thesis we propose a simplification to these types of
devices, suggesting a way in which the superconducting layer can be replaced.
Part of our proposal includes a model Hamiltonian for these types of systems.
This thesis will also develop several different methods to analyze this model
Hamiltonian in various different parameter regimes with the ultimate goal of
classifying its topology.

the WMAP9 dataset, for which \Delta\chi^2~20. The Planck and WMAP9 results are
broadly consistent on angular scales where they are expected to agree as far as
best-fit values are concerned. However, even on these scales the significance
of the signal is reduced in Planck relative to WMAP, and is consistent with a
fit to the noise associated with cosmic variance. Our results motivate both a
detailed comparison between the two experiments and a more careful study of the

produce characteristic signals, such as statistical anisotropy, on the

magnitude of such characteristic features crucially depends on the magnitude of
the vector condensate generated during inflation. However, the expectation
value of this condensate has so-far been taken as a free parameter, lacking a

the stochastic evolution of the vector condensate and obtain an estimate for
its magnitude. Our study is mainly focused in the supergravity inspired case
when the kinetic function and mass of the vector boson is time-varying during

The model is based on spherically symmetric hydrodynamic equations complemented
with transport equations for relativistic particles. Electrons, protons and the
oxygen ions accelerated by forward and reverse shocks are included in the
numerical calculations. We show that the available multi-wavelength
observations in the radio, X-ray and gamma-ray bands can be best explained by
invoking particle acceleration by both forward and reversed shocks. Although
the TeV gamma-ray observations can be interpreted by interactions of both
accelerated electrons and protons/ions, the measurements by Fermi LAT at
energies below 1 GeV give a tentative preference to the hadronic origin of
gamma-rays. Then, the acceleration efficiency in this source, despite the
previous claims, should be very high; 25% of the explosion energy (or
approximately $3\cdot 10^{50}$ erg) should already be converted to cosmic rays,
mainly by the forward shock. At the same time, the model calculations do not
provide extension of the maximum energy of accelerated protons beyond 100 TeV.
In this model, the acceleration of electrons is dominated by the reverse shock;
the required $10^{48}$ erg can be achieved under the assumption that the
injection of electrons (positrons) is supported by the radioactive decay of
$^{44}$Ti.

studies on the formation and evolution of galaxies. Most EPS models are still
poorly calibrated for certain stellar evolution stages, especially for the
treatment of binary stars, which are very different from single stars. We aim
to present color-magnitude (C-M) and color-color (C-C) relations for passive
model galaxies in the redshift z$\sim0.0-3.0$ and to study the effect of binary
interactions on these relations for high-redshift passive galaxies. Assuming
exponentially declining star formation rate, we used a set of theoretical
galaxy templates obtained from Yunnan EPS models (with and without binary
interactions) to present the C-M and C-C relations for passive galaxies via
Monte Carlo simulation. In Yunnan EPS models with binary interactions, various
processes are included, such as mass transfer, mass accretion, common-envelope
evolution, collisions, supernova kicks, tidal evolution, and all angular
momentum loss mechanisms. In these models, approximately 50 per cent of the
stellar systems are binary systems with orbital periods less than 100\,yr. This
fraction is a typical value for the Milky Way. We find that the inclusion of
binary interactions in the model galaxies' spectra can dramatically alter the
predicted C-M and C-C relations and their evolution with redshift. For $z\sim
0.0$ and $1.0$, the binary interactions have a minor effect on the C-M and C-C
relations, but at $z\sim 2.0$ and $3.0$ the binary interactions have a major
effect on the C-M and C-C relations. Especially for the redshift $z\sim 2.0$,
the $g-$band magnitude becomes smaller by $1.5$\,mag, the $g-r$ color becomes
bluer by $1.0$\,mag, and the $u-g$ color becomes redder by $1.0$\,mag when

carry out the maximization step of the EM algorithm. Moreover, to reduce the

to track the PHN parameters. Numerical results show that by combining the
proposed EKFS based approach with an iterative detector that employs low

also demonstrate that compared to existing algorithms, the proposed iterative

used successfully in entanglement classification. Generalization of this has
been a long standing open problem due to the difficulties faced in the
construction of a Majorana like geometric representation for symmetric mixed

local unitary (LU) equivalent classes of symmetric $N$-qubit mixed states based
on the geometrical Multiaxial Representation (MAR) of the density matrix. In
addition to the two parameters defined for the entanglement classification of
the symmetric pure states based on MR, namely, diversity degree and degeneracy
configuration, we show that another parameter called rank needs to be
introduced for symmetric mixed state classification. Our scheme of
classification is more general as it can be applied to both pure and mixed

classification based on MR is not a special case of our classification scheme

another---if a player changes strategies, then this change in strategies does
not affect the choice of other players' strategies. In many situations this is
an unrealistic assumption. We develop a framework for reasoning about games
where the players may be translucent to one another; in particular, a player
may believe that if she were to change strategies, then the other player would
also change strategies. Translucent players may achieve significantly more
efficient outcomes than opaque ones.
  Our main result is a characterization of strategies consistent with
appropriate analogues of common belief of rationality. Common Counterfactual
Belief of Rationality (CCBR) holds if (1) everyone is rational, (2) everyone
counterfactually believes that everyone else is rational (i.e., all players i
believe that everyone else would still be rational even if $i$ were to switch
strategies), (3) everyone counterfactually believes that everyone else is
rational, and counterfactually believes that everyone else is rational, and so
on. CCBR characterizes the set of strategies surviving iterated removal of
minimax dominated strategies, where a strategy s for player i is minimax
dominated by s' if the worst-case payoff for i using s' is better than the best

closer and closer to the target as the number of iterations increases. The
proposal pdf is built using interpolation procedures based on a set of support
points which is constructed iteratively based on previously drawn samples. The
algorithm's efficiency is ensured by a test that controls the evolution of the
set of support points. This extra stage controls the computational cost and the
convergence of the proposal density to the target. Each part of the novel
family of algorithms is discussed and several examples are provided. Although
the novel algorithms are presented for univariate target densities, we show
that they can be easily extended to the multivariate context within a

Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) is a meta-heuristic optimization and

imperialistic competition. The ICA contains two main operators: the
assimilation and the imperialistic competition. The ICA has excellent
capabilities such as high convergence rate and better global optimum

been investigated quantitatively. Due to the spin-pumping effect driven by the
magnetization precession in the ferrimagnetic insulator YIG film a
spin-polarized electron current is injected into the Pt layer. This spin
current is transformed into electrical charge current by means of the ISHE. An
increase of the ISHE-voltage with increasing film thickness is observed and
compared to the theoretically expected behavior. The effective damping
parameter of the YIG/Pt samples is found to be enhanced with decreasing YIG
film thickness. The investigated samples exhibit a spin mixing conductance of
g=(7.43 \pm 0.36) \times 10^{18} m^{-2} and a spin Hall angle of theta_{ISHE} =
0.009 \pm 0.0008. Furthermore, the influence of nonlinear effects on the
generated voltage and on the Gilbert damping parameter at high excitation
powers are revealed. It is shown that for small YIG film thicknesses a
broadening of the linewidth due to nonlinear effects at high excitation powers
is suppressed because of a lack of nonlinear multi-magnon scattering channels.
We have found that the variation of the spin-pumping efficiency for thick YIG
samples exhibiting pronounced nonlinear effects is much smaller than the
nonlinear enhancement of the damping.

in a system which is capable of experiencing cascading failure. In our model
the susceptibility of the system to cascades is described by a single number,
the propagation power, which measures the ease with which cascades propagate.
Physically, such a number could represent the density of unstable material in a
system, its internal connectivity, or the mean susceptibility of its component
parts to failure. We assume that the propagation power follows an upward
drifting Brownian motion between cascades, and drops discontinuously each time
a cascade occurs. Cascades are described by a continuous state branching
process with distributional properties determined by the value of the
propagation power when they occur. In common with many cascading models, pure
power law behaviour is exhibited at a critical level of propagation power, and
the mean cascade size diverges. This divergence constrains large systems to the
subcritical region. We show that as a result, crossover behaviour appears in
the cascade distribution when an average is performed over the distribution of
propagation power. We are able to analytically determine the exponents before
and after the crossover.

is to strengthen the connection between models and biological data by
quantifying the rules that individuals follow. We model aggregation of the pea
aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum. Specifically, we conduct experiments to track the
motion of aphids walking in a featureless circular arena in order to deduce
individual-level rules. We observe that each aphid transitions stochastically
between a moving and a stationary state. Moving aphids follow a correlated
random walk. The probabilities of motion state transitions, as well as the
random walk parameters, depend strongly on distance to an aphid's nearest
neighbor. For large nearest neighbor distances, when an aphid is essentially
isolated, its motion is ballistic with aphids moving faster, turning less, and
being less likely to stop. In contrast, for short nearest neighbor distances,
aphids move more slowly, turn more, and are more likely to become stationary;
this behavior constitutes an aggregation mechanism. From the experimental data,
we estimate the state transition probabilities and correlated random walk
parameters as a function of nearest neighbor distance. With the
individual-level model established, we assess whether it reproduces the
macroscopic patterns of movement at the group level. To do so, we consider
three distributions, namely distance to nearest neighbor, angle to nearest
neighbor, and percentage of population moving at any given time. For each of
these three distributions, we compare our experimental data to the output of
numerical simulations of our nearest neighbor model, and of a control model in
which aphids do not interact socially. Our stochastic, social nearest neighbor
model reproduces salient features of the experimental data that are not
captured by the control.

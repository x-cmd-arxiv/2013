an ab initio approach. After deposition of a Ni overlayer alloyed with Pt, the
calculations reveal fast diffusion of Ni atoms into the Si lattice, which leads
initially to the formation of Ni2Si. At the same time Si atoms are found to
diffuse into the metallic overlayer. The transformation of Ni2Si into NiSi is
likely to proceed via a vacancy-assisted diffusion mechanism. Silicon atoms are
the main diffusing species in this transformation, migrating from the Si
substrate through the growing NiSi layer into the Ni2Si. Pt atoms have a low
solubility in Ni2Si and prefer Si-sites in the NiSi lattice, thereby
stabilizing the NiSi phase. The diffusivity of Pt is lower than that of Ni.
Furthermore, Pt atoms have a tendency to segregate to interfaces, thereby
acting as diffusion barriers.

there is a critical value below which there are three steady states and above
which there is only one. Consensus in favor of the zealots' opinion is the
steady state that always exists, and is stable. The second steady state is the
uniform distribution in the absence of zealots, and moves away from the
zealots' opinion as the number of zealots increases. This state is unstable.
The last steady state starts at consensus against the zealots, and moves toward
the zealots' opinion as the number of zealots increases. This state is stable.

electron (RE) generation through a comparative study of similar slow argon
injection JET disruptions, performed with different wall materials. In the
carbon wall case, a runaway electron plateau is observed, while in the
ITER-like wall case, the current quench is slower and the runaway current is
negligibly small. The aim of the paper is to shed light on the reason for these
differences by detailed numerical modelling to study which factors affected the
RE formation. The post-disruption current profile is calculated by a
one-dimensional model of electric field, temperature and runaway current taking
into account the impurity injection. Scans of various impurity contents are
performed and agreement with the experimental scenarios is obtained for
reasonable argon- and wall impurity contents. Our modelling shows that the
reason for the changed RE dynamics is a complex, combined effect of the
differences in plasma parameter profiles, the radiation characteristics of
beryllium and carbon, and the difference of the injected argon amount. These
together lead to a significantly higher Dreicer generation rate in the carbon
wall case, which is less prone to be suppressed by RE loss mechanisms. The
results indicate that the differences are greatly reduced above ~50% argon
content, suggesting that significant RE current is expected in future massive
gas injection experiments on both JET and ITER.

Hypothesis, our two main results are:
  - For any r larger than some constant, any r-approximation algorithm for the
maximum independent set problem must run in at least
2^{n^{1-\epsilon}/r^{1+\epsilon}} time. This nearly matches the upper bound of
2^{n/r} (Cygan et al., 2008). It also improves some hardness results in the
domain of parameterized complexity (e.g., Escoffier et al., 2012 and Chitnis et
al., 2013)
  - For any k larger than some constant, there is no polynomial time min
(k^{1-\epsilon}, n^{1/2-\epsilon})-approximation algorithm for the k-hypergraph
pricing problem, where n is the number of vertices in an input graph. This
almost matches the upper bound of min (O(k), \tilde O(\sqrt{n})) (by Balcan and
Blum, 2007 and an algorithm in this paper).
  We note an interesting fact that, in contrast to n^{1/2-\epsilon} hardness
for polynomial-time algorithms, the k-hypergraph pricing problem admits
n^{\delta} approximation for any \delta >0 in quasi-polynomial time. This puts
this problem in a rare approximability class in which approximability
thresholds can be improved significantly by allowing algorithms to run in
quasi-polynomial time.

W_r(2796) ~ (D/R_vir)^-2, with projected location relative to the galaxy virial

explore multivariate relationships between W_r(2796), virial mass, impact

elucidate self-similarity in the cool/warm (T=10^{4-4.5} K) circumgalactic

and strength of the MgII absorbing gas such that the mean W_r(2796) increases
with virial mass at fixed distance while decreasing with galactocentric
distance for fixed virial mass. The majority of the absorbing gas resides
within D ~ 0.3 R_vir, independent of both virial mass and minimum absorption
threshold; inside this region, and perhaps also in the region 0.3 < D/R_vir =
1, the mean W_r(2796) is independent of virial mass. Contrary to
absorber-galaxy cross-correlation studies, we show there is no anti-correlation

effective spin averaged interfacial transmission probabilities and effective
out-of-plane polarizations at both interfaces. It is proven that the latter
plays a key role in the emergence of perpendicular spin torque as well as in
the angular dependence character of all spin and charge transport considered.
It is demonstrated directly also that for any applied voltage, the parallel
component of spin current at the FM/I interface is expressed via collinear
longitudinal spin current components. Finally, spin transfer torque behavior is
analyzed in a view of transverse characteristic length scales for spin

brought into confinement by the walls of a random porous medium. Inside the
porous medium, phase transition points are shifted, or may disappear
altogether. A crucial determinant is how the walls interact with the fluid
particles. In this work, we consider the situation whereby the walls are
neutral with respect to the liquid and vapor phase. In order to realize the
condition of strict neutrality, we use a symmetric binary mixture inside a
porous medium that interacts identically with both of the mixture species.
Monte Carlo simulations are then used to obtain the phase behavior. Our main
finding is that, in the presence of the porous medium, a liquid-vapor type
transition still occurs, but with critical exponents that deviate from bulk
Ising values. In addition, we observe clear violations of self-averaging. These
findings provide further evidence that random confinement by neutral walls
induces critical behavior of the random Ising model (i.e. Ising models with
dilution type disorder, where the disorder couples to the energy).

after the removal of several previously identified discrete velocity
components. Its amplitude like that of the Hubble velocity showed an increase
with distance, as would be expected for a constant-amplitude space oscillation.
Here we report that this oscillation is also present in distance clumping in
these sources, with the same wavelength, but in phase quadrature. The discrete
velocity components do not play a role in detecting the distance clumping
wavelength. Assuming that time proceeds from high cosmological redshift to low,
the blue-shifted velocity peaks, which represent the contraction stage of the
velocity oscillation, then lead the density peaks. With the discrete velocity

associated with flares have been systematically observed in recent years. The
most striking features include the increase of horizontal field at the polarity
inversion line (PIL) and the co-spatial penumbral darkening. A likely
explanation of the above phenomenon is the back reaction to the coronal
restructuring after eruptions: a coronal mass ejection carries the upward
momentum while the downward momentum compresses the field lines near the PIL.
Previous studies could only use low resolution (above 1"") magnetograms and
white-light images. Therefore, the changes are mostly observed for X-class
flares. Taking advantage of the 0.1"" spatial resolution and 15s temporal
cadence of the New Solar Telescope at Big Bear Solar Observatory, we report in
detail the rapid formation of sunspot penumbra at the PIL associated with the
C7.4 flare on 2012 July 2. It is unambiguously shown that the solar granulation
pattern evolves to alternating dark and bright fibril structure, the typical
pattern of penumbra. Interestingly, the appearance of such a penumbra creates a
new delta sunspot. The penumbral formation is also accompanied by the
enhancement of horizontal field observed using vector magnetograms from the
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager. We explain our observations as due to the
eruption of a flux rope following magnetic cancellation at the PIL.
Subsequently the re-closed arcade fields are pushed down towards the surface to
form the new penumbra. NLFFF extrapolation clearly shows both the flux rope
close to the surface and the overlying fields.

corrections to the pi N sigma term as a result of the interactions between pion
and nucleon in nuclear matter. We also discuss that higher density

mass galaxies are probably due to finite-volume effects. In addition, we
compare the clustering of ALFALFA galaxies with optically selected samples
drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find that HI-selected
galaxies cluster more weakly than even relatively optically faint galaxies,
when no color selection is applied. Conversely, when SDSS galaxies are split
based on their color, we find that the correlation function of blue optical
galaxies is practically indistinguishable from that of HI-selected galaxies. At
the same time, SDSS galaxies with red colors are found to cluster significantly
more than HI-selected galaxies, a fact that is evident in both the projected as
well as the full two-dimensional correlation function. A cross-correlation
analysis further reveals that gas-rich galaxies ""avoid"" being located within ~3
Mpc of optical galaxies with red colors. Next, we consider the clustering
properties of halo samples selected from the Bolshoi LambdaCDM simulation. A
comparison with the clustering of ALFALFA galaxies suggests that galactic HI
mass is not tightly related to host halo mass, and that a sizable fraction of
subhalos do not host HI galaxies. Lastly, we find that we can recover fairly
well the correlation function of HI galaxies by just excluding halos with low
spin parameter. This finding lends support to the hypothesis that halo spin
plays a key role in determining the gas content of galaxies.

but I argue that more generally the paradox is double purity. Near-horizon
modes are purified by the interior, in the infalling vacuum. Hence they cannot
also be pure alone, or in combination with any third system, as demanded by
unitarity. This conflict arises independently of the Page time, for entangled
and for pure states. It implies that identifications of Hilbert spaces cannot
resolve the paradox.
  Traditional complementarity requires the unitary identification of infalling
matter with a scrambled subsystem of the Hawking radiation. Extending this map
to the infalling vacuum overdetermines the out-state. More general
complementarity maps (""A=R_B"", ""ER=EPR"") founder when the near-horizon zone is
pure. I argue that pure-zone states span the microcanonical ensemble, and that
this suffices to make the horizon a special place.
  I advocate that the ability to detect the horizon locally, rather than the
degree or probability of violence, is what makes firewalls problematic.
Conversely, if the production of matter at the horizon can be dynamically
understood and shown to be consistent, then firewalls do not constitute a
violation of the equivalence principle.

spirit of the familiar interpretation of ${n \brace k}$ as a count of
partitions. Specifically, we associate to each $w$ a quasi-threshold graph
$G_w$, and we show that $S_w(k)$ enumerates partitions of the vertex set of
$G_w$ into classes that do not span an edge of $G_w$. We also discuss some
relatives of, and consequences of, our interpretation, including $q$-analogs
and bijections between families of labelled forests and sets of restricted
partitions.

well-resolved galaxies within the LCDM cosmology. Cosmological hydrodynamic
simulations with force resolutions of ~100 proper pc or better will be run with
a variety of code platforms to follow the hierarchical growth, star formation
history, morphological transformation, and the cycle of baryons in and out of 8
galaxies with halo masses M_vir ~= 1e10, 1e11, 1e12, and 1e13 Msun at z=0 and
two different (""violent"" and ""quiescent"") assembly histories. The numerical
techniques and implementations used in this project include the smoothed
particle hydrodynamics codes GADGET and GASOLINE, and the adaptive mesh
refinement codes ART, ENZO, and RAMSES. The codes will share common initial
conditions and common astrophysics packages including UV background,
metal-dependent radiative cooling, metal and energy yields of supernovae, and
stellar initial mass function. These are described in detail in the present
paper. Subgrid star formation and feedback prescriptions will be tuned to
provide a realistic interstellar and circumgalactic medium using a
non-cosmological disk galaxy simulation. Cosmological runs will be
systematically compared with each other using a common analysis toolkit, and
validated against observations to verify that the solutions are robust - i.e.,
that the astrophysical assumptions are responsible for any success, rather than
artifacts of particular implementations. The goals of the AGORA project are,
broadly speaking, to raise the realism and predictive power of galaxy
simulations and the understanding of the feedback processes that regulate
galaxy ""metabolism."" The proof-of-concept dark matter-only test of the
formation of a galactic halo with a z=0 mass of M_vir ~= 1.7e11 Msun by 9
different versions of the participating codes is also presented to validate the

imposed by the Gaia parallax errors degrading to worse than 10%, and could be

demonstrated how Spitzer observations of RR Lyrae stars can be used to make

Letter presents one approach to exploit data of such accuracy to measure the
Galactic potential using small samples of stars associated with debris from
satellite destruction. The method is tested with synthetic observations of 100
stars from the end point of a simulation of satellite destruction: the shape,
orientation, and depth of the potential used in the simulation are recovered to
within a few percent. The success of this simple test with such a small sample
in a single debris stream suggests that constraints from multiple streams could
be combined to examine the Galaxy's dark matter halo in even more detail --- a
truly unique opportunity that is enabled by the combination of Spitzer and Gaia

to determine the star-formation histories of galaxies as well as our

positions and peculiar velocities at late times, since peculiar velocities
reflect the underlying matter distribution, whereas galaxies are a biased
tracer of the same. We study this effect, and show that non-Gaussianity can be
constrained by comparing the observed peculiar velocity field to a model
velocity field reconstructed from the galaxy density field assuming linear
bias. The amplitude of the spatial correlations in the residual map obtained
after subtracting one velocity field from the other is directly proportional to
the strength of the primordial non-Gaussianity. We construct the corresponding
likelihood function use it to constrain the amplitude of the linear flow
$\beta$ and the amplitude of local non-Gaussianity $f^{\rm NL}_{\rm local}$.
Applying our method to two observational data sets, the Type-Ia supernovae

constraints on the linear flow parameter consistent with the values derived
previously assuming Gaussianity. The marginalised 1-D distribution of $|f^{\rm

estimates for posterior statistics at low computational cost, and should be
adopted in favour of Metropolis-Hastings in many cases. Affine-invariant MCMC
is competitive when computing clusters can be utilised for massive
parallelisation. Affine-invariant MCMC and existing extensions to nested

states of a strong sector that breaks a left-right symmetry, which we show to
be the sole symmetry structure responsible for governing the size of these new
effects in the absence of Goldstone-breaking interactions. In this paper we
consider corrections to the decay h -> Z gamma obtained either by integrating
out vectors at tree level, or by integrating out vector-like fermions at loop
level. In each case, the pertinent operators that are generated are
parametrically enhanced relative to other interactions that arise at loop level
in the Standard Model such as h -> gg and h -> gamma gamma. Thus we emphasize
that the effects of interest here provide a unique possibility to probe the
dynamics underlying electroweak symmetry breaking, and do not depend on any
contrivance stemming from carefully chosen spectra. The effects we discuss
naturally lead to concerns of compatibility with precision electroweak

reach 100% completeness at projected distances rho<200 kpc of the quasar
sightline for galaxies as faint as 0.1L* (0.2L*) out to redshifts of z=0.35

survey reveals that OVI absorbers are closely associated with gas-rich
environments containing at least one low-mass, emission-line galaxy. An
intriguing exception is a strong OVI system at z=0.183 that does not have a
galaxy found at rho<4 Mpc, and our survey rules out the presence of any
galaxies of L>0.04L* at rho<250 kpc and any galaxies of L>0.3L* at rho<1 Mpc.
We further examine the galactic environments of OVI absorbers and those
""Lya-only"" absorbers with HI column density log N(HI)>13.6 and no detectable
OVI absorption features. The Lya-only absorbers serve as a control sample in
seeking the discriminating galactic features that result in the observed OVI
absorbing gas at large galactic radii. We find a clear distinction in the
radial profiles of mean galaxy surface brightness around different absorbers.
Specifically, OVI absorbers are found to reside in regions of higher mean
surface brightness at rho<500 kpc (+5 mag Mpc^-2 relative to the background),
while only a mild increase in galaxy surface brightness is seen at small rho
around Lya-only absorbers (+2 mag Mpc^-2). The additional insights gained from
our deep galaxy survey demonstrates the need to probe to low luminosities to
better understand absorbing systems.

([Mg/Fe]~0.3). The stars were made rapidly at z~1.5-2 in shallow potential
wells. Declining radial gradients in [C/Fe], which follow [Fe/H], also arise
from rapid star formation timescales due to declining carbon yields from
low-metallicity massive stars. In contrast, [N/Fe] remains high at large
radius. Stars at large radius have different abundance ratio patterns from
stars in the center of any present-day galaxy, but are similar to Milky Way
thick disk stars. Our observations are thus consistent with a picture in which

Survey (BOSS) for the rare occurrences where a strong damped Lyman-alpha
absorber (DLA) blocks the Broad Line Region emission from the quasar and acts
as a natural coronagraph to reveal narrow Ly\alpha\ emission from the host
galaxy. We define a statistical sample of 31 DLAs in Data Release 9 (DR9) with
log N(HI) > 21.3 cm^-2 located at less than 1500 km s^-1 from the quasar
redshift. In 25% (8) of these DLAs, a strong narrow Ly\alpha\ emission line is
observed with flux ~25 x 10^-17 erg s^-1 cm^-2 on average. For DLAs without
this feature in their troughs, the average 3-\sigma\ upper limit is < 0.8 x
10^-17 erg s^-1 cm^-2. Our statistical sample is nearly 2.5 times larger than
the anticipated number of intervening DLAs in DR9 within 1500 km s^-1 of the
quasar redshift. We also define a sample of 26 DLAs from DR9 and DR10 with
narrow Ly\alpha\ emission detected and no limit on the HI column density to
better characterize properties of the host galaxy emission. Analyzing the
statistical sample, we do not find substantial differences in the kinematics,
metals, or reddening for the two populations with and without emission
detected. The highly symmetric narrow Ly\alpha\ emission line profile centered
in the HI trough indicates that the emitting region is separate from the
absorber. The luminosity of the narrow Ly\alpha\ emission peaks is intermediate
between that of Lyman-alpha emitters and radio galaxies, implying that the
Ly\alpha\ emission is predominantly due to ionizing radiation from the AGN.
Galaxies neighboring the quasar host are likely responsible for the majority (>
75%) of these DLAs, with only a minority (< 25%) arising from HI clouds located
in the AGN host galaxy.

as function of their ionic strength. The effect of salt on the dielectric
constant appears through the coupling between ions and dipolar water molecules.
On a mean-field level, we account for any internal charge distribution of
particles. The dipolar degrees of freedom are added to the ionic ones and
result in a generalization of the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation called the
Dipolar PB (DPB). By looking at the DPB equation around a fixed point-like ion,
a closed-form formula for the dielectric constant is obtained. We express the
dielectric constant using the ""hydration length"" that characterizes the
hydration shell of dipoles around ions, and thus the strength of the dielectric
decrement. The DPB equation is then examined for three additional cases:
mixture of solvents, polarizable medium and ions of finite size. Employing
field-theoretical methods we expand the Gibbs free-energy to first order in a
loop expansion and calculate self-consistently the dielectric constant. For
pure water, the dipolar fluctuations represent an important correction to the
mean-field value and good agreement with the water dielectric constant is
obtained. For ionic solutions we predict analytically the dielectric decrement
that depends on the ionic strength in a non-linear way. Our prediction fits
rather well a large range of concentrations for different salts using only one
fit parameter related to the size of ions and dipoles. A linear dependence of
the dielectric constant on the salt concentration is observed at low salinity,
and a noticeable deviation from linearity can be seen for ionic strength above
1\,M, in agreement with experiments.

the coupling between the corner states lifts the degeneracy in a characteristic

is a double magma for which both operations are associative. Given a group G we
define a double magma (G,*,#) with the commutator operations x * y = [x,y] (=

that the first law defines the variety of 3-metabelian groups. If both these
laws hold in G, (G,*,#) is proper if and only if G contains a commutator whose
square is nontrivial. B.H. Neumann has given an example of such a group which
is not metabelian; thus the associated double magma is proper and produces an

the u-v to uvw1-v colors, but similar to the NUV-blue SNe Ia in the uvm2-v
color. We name these events ""MUV-blue"". The last group initially has colors
similar to NUV-red SNe Ia, but with color curves that feature more modest
changes than the larger NUV-red group. These ""irregular"" events are comprised
of all the NUV-red events with the broadest optical peaks, which leads us to
consider this minor group a subset of the NUV-red group. When so separated and
the accounting is made for the rapid time evolution of the UV-OPT colors, we
find that the scatter in two NUV-OPT colors, u-v & uvw1-v, is at the level of
the scatter in b-v. This finding is promising for extending the cosmological
utilization of SNe Ia into the NUV. We generate spectrophotometry of SNe Ia
that have been observed with HST and argue that there is a fundamental spectral
difference in the 2900-3500A wavelength range, a range suggested to be
dominated by absorption from iron-peak elements. The NUV-blue SNe Ia feature
less NUV absorption than the NUV-red SNe Ia. We show that all the NUV-blue SNe
Ia in this sample have also featured evidence of unburned carbon in optical
spectra, whereas only one NUV-red SN Ia features that absorption line. Every
NUV-blue event also exhibits a low gradient of the SiII 6355A absorption
feature, but many NUV-red events also exhibit a low gradient, perhaps
suggestive that NUV-blue events are a subset of the larger LVG group.

Nearly all of the 60 most heavily observed jets show significant changes in
their innermost position angle over a 12 to 16 year interval, ranging from 10
deg to 150 deg on the sky, corresponding to intrinsic variations of ~0.5 deg to
~2 deg. The BL Lac jets show smaller variations than quasars. Roughly half of
the heavily observed jets show systematic position angle trends with time, and
20 show indications of oscillatory behavior. The time spans of the data sets
are too short compared to the fitted periods (5 to 12 y), however, to reliably
establish periodicity. The rapid changes and large jumps in position angle seen
in many cases suggest that the superluminal AGN jet features occupy only a
portion of the entire jet cross section, and may be energized portions of thin
instability structures within the jet. We have derived vector proper motions
for 887 moving features in 200 jets having at least five VLBA epochs. For 557
well-sampled features, there are sufficient data to additionally study possible
accelerations. We find that the moving features are generally non-ballistic,
with 70% of the well-sampled features showing either significant accelerations
or non-radial motions. Inward motions are rare (2% of all features), are slow
(<0.1 mas per y), are more prevalent in BL Lac jets, and are typically found
within 1 mas of the unresolved core feature. There is a general trend of
increasing apparent speed with distance down the jet for both radio galaxies
and BL Lac objects. In most jets, the speeds of the features cluster around a
characteristic value, yet there is a considerable dispersion in the
distribution. (abridged)

illustrate the phenomenon by using the exactly soluble 1+1 dimensional massless

this mechanism: confinement, chiral symmetry breaking, axial anomaly, and the

lead to a strong resonant enhancement of the soft photon yield; the Low theorem
however remains accurate in the limit of very soft momenta. We then construct

function $f:G\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ on an abelian group $G$ in order to provide
a Fourier-theoretic proof of Szemeredi's Theorem, that is, that a subset of the
integers of positive upper density contains arbitrarily long arithmetic
progressions. Since then, Gowers norms have found a number of other uses, both
within and outside of Additive Combinatorics. The $U^k$ norm is defined in
terms of an operator $\triangle^k : L^{\infty}(G)\mapsto L^{\infty} (G^{k+1})$.
  In this paper, we introduce an analogue of the object $\triangle^k f$ when
$f$ is a singular measure on the torus $\mathbb{T}^d$, and similarly an object
$\|\mu\|_{U^k}$. We provide criteria for $\triangle^k \mu$ to exist, which
turns out to be equivalent to finiteness of $\||\mu|\|_{U^k}$, and show that
when $\mu$ is absolutely continuous with density $f$, then the objects which we
have introduced are reduced to the standard $\triangle^kf$ and
$\|f\|_{U^k(\mathbb{T})}$. We further introduce a higher-order inner product

rotational symmetries R_z (2{\pi} /n) with n $\ge$ 3 are shown to be restricted
by symmetry reasons. Along the symmetry axis, forward scattering can only be
helicity preserving and backward scattering can only be helicity flipping.
These restrictions do not exist for n < 3. If, in addition to the n $\ge$ 3
discrete rotational symmetry, the system has duality symmetry (obeys the
helicity conservation law), it will exhibit zero backscattering. The results
pinpoint the underlying symmetry reasons for some notable scattering properties
of R_z (2{\pi} /4) symmetric systems that have been reported in the
metamaterials and radar literature. Applications to planar metamaterials and

Constrained minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) receive filters designed with
constraints on the shape and magnitude of the feedback filters for the

implementation of the proposed MB-MMSE-DF detector is developed along with a
recursive least squares-type algorithm for estimating the parameters of the
receive filters when the channel is time-varying. A soft-output version of the
MB-MMSE-DF detector is also proposed as a component of an iterative detection

the MB-MMSE-DF detector does not require a significant additional complexity
over the conventional MMSE-DF detector, whereas a diversity analysis discusses
the diversity order achieved by the MB-MMSE-DF detector. Simulation results
show that the MB-MMSE-DF detector achieves a performance superior to existing

generic trends for the stellar, baryonic and halo mass assembly of low-mass
galaxies (M_* < 3 x 10^10 M_sun) as a function of their present halo mass, in
the context of the Lambda-CDM scenario and common subgrid physics schemes. We
obtain that smaller galaxies exhibit higher specific star formation rates and
higher gas fractions. Although these trends are in rough agreement with
observations, the absolute values of these quantities tend to be lower than
observed ones since z~2. The simulated galaxy stellar mass fraction increases
with halo mass, consistently with semi-empirical inferences. However, the
predicted correlation between them shows negligible variations up to high z,
while these inferences seem to indicate some evolution. The hot gas mass in z=0
halos is higher than the central galaxy mass by a factor of ~1-1.5 and this
factor increases up to ~5-7 at z~2 for the smallest galaxies. The stellar,
baryonic and halo evolutionary tracks of simulated galaxies show that smaller
galaxies tend to delay their baryonic and stellar mass assembly with respect to
the halo one. The Supernova feedback treatment included in this model plays a
key role on this behaviour albeit the trend is still weaker than the one
inferred from observations. At z>2, the overall properties of simulated
galaxies are not in large disagreement with those derived from observations.

spline interpolation requires filtering the whole sampled data, the past and

of the filter, and this becomes a critical issue for real-time applications.
Our objective here is to derive a causal system which approximates spline
interpolation by H-infinity optimization for the filter. The advantage of
H-infinity optimization is that it can address uncertainty in the input signals
to be interpolated in design, and hence the optimized system has robustness
property against signal uncertainty. We give a closed-form solution to the
H-infinity optimization in the case of the cubic splines. For higher-order
splines, the optimal filter can be effectively solved by a numerical
computation. We also show that the optimal FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filter
can be designed by an LMI (Linear Matrix Inequality), which can also be
effectively solved numerically. A design example is presented to illustrate the
result.

by R. Kouba et al. [{\em Phys. Rev. B} {\bf 60}, 9321 (1999)] optimization is
compulsory to a band structure calculation that will describe appropriately the
electronic properties. But starting with the experimental parameters a further
optimization procedure previous to the actual ab initio calculation leads to
the Bi-O pockets. Doping with 25% of Pb they disappear. From the several
configurations that we have considered, we found two very simple ways in which
the Bi-O pockets disappear without avoiding an optimization procedure previous
to the calculation and without including a doping of any kind. In this paper,
we report the effect of the slight displacement of the oxygen atom associated

radio telescope. The MWA is the low frequency precursor to the Square Kilometre
Array (SKA) and is the first of three SKA precursors to be operational,
supporting a varied science mission ranging from the attempted detection of the
Epoch of Reionisation to the monitoring of solar flares and space weather. We
explore the possibility that the MWA can be used for the purposes of Space
Situational Awareness (SSA). In particular we propose that the MWA can be used
as an element of a passive radar facility operating in the frequency range 87.5
- 108 MHz (the commercial FM broadcast band). In this scenario the MWA can be
considered the receiving element in a bi-static radar configuration, with FM
broadcast stations serving as non-cooperative transmitters. The FM broadcasts
propagate into space, are reflected off debris in Earth orbit, and are received
at the MWA. The imaging capabilities of the MWA can be used to simultaneously
detect multiple pieces of space debris, image their positions on the sky as a
function of time, and provide tracking data that can be used to determine
orbital parameters. Such a capability would be a valuable addition to
Australian and global SSA assets, in terms of southern and eastern hemispheric
coverage. We provide a feasibility assessment of this proposal, based on simple
calculations and electromagnetic simulations that shows the detection of
sub-metre size debris should be possible (debris radius of >0.5 m to ~1000 km
altitude). We also present a proof-of-concept set of observations that
demonstrate the feasibility of the proposal, based on the detection and
tracking of the International Space Station via reflected FM broadcast signals
originating in south-west Western Australia. These observations broadly
validate our calculations and simulations.

formulated as an alternative classical field equation by the Ideal projection
for the Dirac equation in the Minkowski space-time, so does it only in that
flat geometry. I. M. Benn and R. W. Tucker in 1985 and Yu. N. Obukhov and S. N.

equation in order for it to make senses as an alternative for the Dirac

approach, however in the Minkowski space yet, as the first stage toward the
generalization. Two ingredients for the modifications are essential. One is the
restriction of the space of anti-symmetric tensor field to only its
subalgebras, not to its Ideals. The other is the modification on the mass term
for the equation to mean the eigenvalue problem generating physical states. The

computing applications. Recent proposals for spinbased computing schemes may be
differentiated as all-spin vs. hybrid, programmable vs. fixed, and, Boolean vs.
non-Boolean. All spin logic-styles may offer high area-density due to small
form-factor of nano-magnetic devices. However, circuit and system-level design
techniques need to be explored that leverage the specific spin-device
characteristics to achieve energy-efficiency, performance and reliability
comparable to those of CMOS. The non-volatility of nanomagnets can be exploited
in the design of energy and area-efficient programmable logic. In such
logic-styles, spin-devices may play the dual-role of computing as well as
memory-elements that provide field-programmability. Spin-based threshold logic
design is presented as an example (dynamic resisitve threshold logic and
magnetic threshold logic). Emerging spintronic phenomena may lead to ultralow-
voltage, current-mode, spin-torque switches that can offer attractive computing
capabilities, beyond digital switches. Such devices may be suitable for
non-Boolean data-processing applications which involve analog processing.
Integration of such spin-torque devices with charge-based devices like CMOS and
resistive memory can lead to highly energy-efficient information processing
hardware for applications like pattern-matching, neuromorphic-computing,
image-processing and data-conversion. Towards the end, we discuss the
possibility of applying emerging spin-torque switches in the design of
energy-efficient global interconnects, for future chip multiprocessors.

channel state information for block-fading channels. Optimal training sounds
the channel using orthogonal beamforming vectors to find an estimate that
optimizes some cost function, such as mean square error. As the number of
transmit antennas increases, however, the training overhead becomes
significant. This creates a need for alternative channel estimation schemes for
increasingly large transmit arrays. In this work, we relax the orthogonal
restriction on sounding vectors. The use of a feedback channel after each
forward channel use during training enables closed-loop sounding vector design.
A misalignment cost function is introduced, which provides a metric to
sequentially design sounding vectors. In turn, the structure of the sounding
vectors aligns the transmit beamformer with the true channel direction, thereby
increasing beamforming gain. This beam alignment scheme for massive MIMO is
shown to improve beamforming gain over conventional orthogonal training for a

transport of cellular cargoes on cytoskeletal filaments. In many cases, cargo
motion powered by motor proteins is found to be bidirectional, and may be
viewed as a biased random walk with fast unidirectional runs interspersed with
slow `tug-of-war' states. The statistical properties of this walk are not known
in detail, and here, we study memory and bias, as well as directional
correlations between successive runs in bidirectional transport. We show, based
on a study of the direction reversal probabilities of the cargo using a purely
stochastic (tug-of-war) model, that bidirectional motion of cellular cargoes
is, in general, a correlated random walk. In particular, while the motion of a
cargo driven by two oppositely pulling motors is a Markovian random walk,
memory of direction appears when multiple motors haul the cargo in one or both
directions. In the latter case, the Markovian nature of the underlying single
motor processes is hidden by internal transitions between degenerate run and
pause states of the cargo. Interestingly, memory is found to be a non-monotonic
function of the number of motors. Stochastic numerical simulations of the
tug-of-war model support our mathematical results and extend them to
biologically relevant situations.

magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Starting from a magnetized primordial
prestellar cloud, we calculate the cloud evolution several hundreds of years
after first protostar formation, resolving the protostellar radius. When the
natal minihalo field strength is weaker than B \lesssim 10^-13 (n/1 cm^-3)^-2/3
G (n is the hydrogen number density), magnetic effects can be ignored. In this
case, fragmentation occurs frequently and a stellar cluster forms, in which
stellar mergers and mass exchange between protostars contribute to the mass
growth of these protostars. During the early gas accretion phase, the most
massive protostar remains near the cloud centre, whereas some of the less
massive protostars are ejected. The magnetic field significantly affects
Population III star formation when B_amb \gtrsim 10^-12 (n/1 cm^-3)^-2/3 G. In
this case, because the angular momentum around the protostar is effectively
transferred by both magnetic braking and protostellar jets, the gas falls
directly onto the protostar without forming a disk, and only a single massive
star forms. In addition, a massive binary stellar system appears when B_amb
\sim 10^-12 (n/1cm^-3)^-2/3 G. Therefore, the magnetic field determines the end
result of the formation process (cluster, binary or single star) for Population
III stars. Moreover, no persistent circumstellar disk appears around the
protostar regardless of the magnetic field strength, which may influence the
further evolution of Population III stars.

a possible continuous phase transition between the N\'eel state and a gapped

transition can be realized through two steps: First bring the N\'eel state to
the U(1) deconfined quantum critical point, which has been studied in the
context of N\'eel -- valence bond solid (VBS) state phase transition. Then
condense the spinon pair -- skyrmion/antiskyrmion bound state, which carries
both gauge charge and flux of the U(1) gauge field emerging at the deconfined
quantum critical point. We also propose a Schwinger boson projective wave
function to realize such a Z$_2$ spin liquid state and find that it has a
relatively low variational energy ($-0.4893J_1$/site) for the $J_1$-$J_2$ model
at $J_2=0.5J_1$. The spin liquid state we obtain breaks the fourfold rotational
symmetry of the square lattice and therefore is a nematic spin liquid state.

the Br-gamma fluxes with Pa-alpha line emission and radio continuum indicate
A_K ~ 3, A_V ~ 25 for the nuclear star forming regions. The most luminous HII
regions are restricted to within 70pc of the center, despite the presence of
high gas columns at larger radii (R ~ 200pc). H2 emission is restricted to

on univariate two-sample comparison of single genes. This means that they
cannot test for differences in covariance structure between the two conditions.
Yet interplay between genes is a central aspect of biological investigation and
it is likely that such interplay may differ between conditions. This paper
proposes a novel approach for gene-set analysis that allows for truly
multivariate hypotheses, in particular differences in gene-gene networks

the nature of the underlying estimation problem. Our starting point is a
recent, general approach for high-dimensional two-sample testing. We refine the

has been shown that the proposed algorithm based on new networked-structure can
be to solve the optimization problems on stochastic graph through less number
of sampling in compare to standard sampling. Stochastic graphs are graphs in
which the edges have an unknown distribution probability weights. Proposed
algorithm uses an eDLA to find a policy that leads to an induced sub-graph that
satisfies some restrictions such as minimum or maximum weight (length). At each
stage of the proposed algorithm, eDLA determines which edges to be sampled.
This eDLA-based proposed sampling method may result in decreasing unnecessary

arbitrarily close to 1 by using a sufficiently small learning rate. A new

odd number of states acquiring large occupations. Within mean-field theory we
derive a criterion for when a single and when multiple states are Bose selected

model systems, and propose a quantum switch for heat conductivity based on
shifting between one and three selected states.

that were observed with modern instruments, e.g. long cycle duration and a
small number of sunspots. To appreciate the anomalies further, we investigated
the prominence eruptions and disappearances observed with the Nobeyama
Radioheliograph during over 20 years. Consequently, we found that the
occurrence of the prominence activities in the northern hemisphere is normal
because the period of the number variation is 11 years and the migration of the
producing region of the prominence activities traces the migration of 11 years
ago. On the other hand, the migration in the southern hemisphere significantly
differs from that in the northern hemisphere and the previous cycles. The
prominence activities occurred over -50 degrees latitude in spite of the late
decay phase of Cycle 23, and the number of the prominence activities in the
higher latitude region (over -65 degrees) is very small even near the solar
maximum of Cycle 24. The results suggest that the anomalies of the global
magnetic field distribution started at the solar maximum of Cycle 23.
Comparison of the butterfly diagram of the prominence activities with the
magnetic butterfly diagram indicates that the timing of ""the rush to the pole""
and the polar magnetic field closely relates to the unusual migration.
Considering that the rush to the pole is made of the sunspots, the hemispheric
asymmetry of the sunspots and the strength of the polar magnetic fields are
essential for understanding the anomalies of the prominence activities.

fitting a single model to the combined data from multiple surveys is
inadvisable without testing the implicit assumption that all of the surveys are
directed at the same inferential target. In this paper we propose a
multivariate generalized linear geostatistical model that accommodates two
sources of heterogeneity across surveys so as to correct for spatially
structured bias in non-randomised surveys and to allow for temporal variation
in the underlying prevalence surface between consecutive survey-periods. We
describe a Monte Carlo maximum likelihood procedure for parameter estimation,
and show through simulation experiments how accounting for the different
sources of heterogeneity among surveys in a joint model leads to more precise
inferences. We describe an application to multiple surveys of malaria

with a view to achieving objective inference about unknown parameters on which
available data depends. Noninformative priors depend on the relationship of the
data to the parameters over the sample space. Combining Bayesian updating -
multiplying an existing posterior density for parameters being estimated by a
likelihood function derived from independent new data that depend on those
parameters and renormalizing - with use of noninformative priors gives rise to
inconsistency where existing and new data depend on continuous parameters in
different ways. In such cases, noninformative priors for inference from only
the existing and from only the new data would differ, so Bayesian updating
would give different final posterior densities depending on which set of data
was used to derive an initial posterior and which was used to update that
posterior. I propose a revised Bayesian updating method, which resolves this
inconsistency by updating the prior as well as the likelihood function, and
involves only a single application of Bayes' theorem. The revised method is
also applicable where actual prior information as to parameter values exists
and inference that objectively reflects the existing information as well as new
data is sought. I demonstrate by numerical testing the probability-matching
superiority of the proposed revised updating method, in two cases.

employing a chemical potential dependent bag function. It is found that the
magnetized color-flavor-locked (MCFL) matter is more stable than other phases
within a proper magnitude of magnetic field. The stability window is
graphically shown for the MCFL matter compared with ordinate magnetized matter.
The anisotropic structure of MCFL matter is dominated by the magnetic field and
almost independent of the energy gaps. A critical maximum magnetic field of
about $1.56\times 10^{18}$ G is found, under which MCFL matter is absolutely
stable with respect to nuclear matter.

between self-similar group actions and a class of left cancellative monoids
called left Rees monoids. These monoids can be constructed either directly from
the action using Zappa-Sz\'ep products, a construction that ultimately goes
back to Perrot, or as left cancellative tensor monoids from the covering
bimodule, utilizing a construction due to Nekrashevych, In this paper, we
generalize the tensor monoid construction to arbitrary bimodules. We call the
monoids that arise in this way Levi monoids and show that they are precisely
the equidivisible monoids equipped with length functions. Left Rees monoids are
then just the left cancellative Levi monoids. We single out the class of
irreducible Levi monoids and prove that they are determined by an isomorphism
between two divisors of its group of units. The irreducible Rees monoids are
thereby shown to be determined by a partial automorphism of their group of
units; this result turns out to be signficant since it connects irreducible
Rees monoids directly with HNN extensions. In fact, the universal group of an
irreducible Rees monoid is an HNN extension of the group of units by a single
stable letter and every such HNN extension arises in this way.

important to understand which windows for beyond the SM (BSM) physics are still
open, and which are instead tightly closed. We address this question by
parametrizing BSM effects with dimension-six operators and performing a global
fit to the SM. We separate operators into different groups constrained at
different levels, and provide independent bounds on their Wilson coefficients
taking into account only the relevant experiments. Our analysis allows to
assert in a model-independent way where BSM effects can appear in Higgs
physics. In particular, we show that deviations from the SM in the differential
distributions of h->Vff are related to other observables, such as triple
gauge-boson couplings, and are then already constrained by present data. On the
contrary, BR(h-> Z+gamma) can still hide large deviations from the SM.

ordered components of the magnetic field are key parameters to characterise
magnetic turbulence in the interstellar gas, which affects the propagation of
cosmic rays within the Galaxy. We provide new constraints to those two
parameters. We use the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) to image the diffuse
continuum emission in the Fan region at (l,b) (137.0,+7.0) at 80""x70""
resolution in the range [146,174] MHz. We detect multi-scale fluctuations in
the Galactic synchrotron emission and compute their power spectrum. Applying
theoretical estimates and derivations from the literature for the first time,
we derive the outer scale of turbulence and the ratio of random to ordered
magnetic field from the characteristics of these fluctuations . We obtain the
deepest image of the Fan region to date and find diffuse continuum emission
within the primary beam. The power spectrum of the foreground synchrotron
fluctuations displays a power law behaviour for scales between 100 and 8 arcmin
with a slope of (-1.84+/-0.19). We find an upper limit of about 20 pc for the
outer scale of the magnetic interstellar turbulence toward the Fan region. We
also find a variation of the ratio of random to ordered field as a function of
Galactic coordinates, supporting different turbulent regimes. We use power
spectra fluctuations from LOFAR as well as earlier GMRT and WSRT observations
to constrain the outer scale of turbulence of the Galactic synchrotron
foreground, finding a range of plausible values of 10-20 pc. Then, we use this
information to deduce lower limits of the ratio of ordered to random magnetic
field strength. These are found to be 0.3, 0.3, and 0.5 for the LOFAR, WSRT and
GMRT fields considered respectively. Both these constraints are in agreement
with previous estimates.

in a heteroscedastic nonparametric multiple regression under the mean
integrated squared error (MISE) criteria. The aim is to understand how the
scale function should be used for estimation of the univariate component. It is
known that the scale function does not affect the rate of the MISE convergence,
and as a result sharp constants are explored. The paper begins with developing
a sharp-minimax theory for a pivotal model
$Y=f(X)+\sigma(X,\mathbf{Z})\varepsilon$, where $\varepsilon$ is standard
normal and independent of the predictor X and the auxiliary vector-covariate
$\mathbf{Z}$. It is shown that if the scale $\sigma(x,\mathbf{z})$ depends on
the auxiliary variable, then a special estimator, which uses the scale (or its
estimate), is asymptotically sharp minimax and adaptive to unknown smoothness
of f(x). This is an interesting conclusion because if the scale does not depend
on the auxiliary covariate $\mathbf{Z}$, then ignoring the heteroscedasticity
can yield a sharp minimax estimation. The pivotal model serves as a natural
benchmark for a general additive model
$Y=f(X)+g(\mathbf{Z})+\sigma(X,\mathbf{Z})\varepsilon$, where $\varepsilon$ may
depend on $(X,\mathbf{Z})$ and have only a finite fourth moment. It is shown
that for this model a data-driven estimator can perform as well as for the
benchmark. Furthermore, the estimator, suggested for continuous responses, can
be also used for the case of discrete responses. Bernoulli and Poisson
regressions, that are inherently heteroscedastic, are particular considered
examples for which sharp minimax lower bounds are obtained as well. A numerical
study shows that the asymptotic theory sheds light on small samples.

function are obtained for each of the state analytically. It is found that
mixed states with higher rank are better resource for teleportation. In order

To detect filaments a marked point process with interactions (the ""Bisous

axes of ellipticals are found to be preferentially perpendicular to hosting
filaments. A weak correlation is found with sheets. These findings are
consistent with the notion that elliptical galaxies formed via mergers which
predominantly occurred along the filaments. The spin axis of spiral galaxies is
found to align with the host filament, with no correlation between spiral spin
and sheet normal. When examined as a function of distance from the filament
axis, a much stronger correlation is found in outer parts, suggesting that the
alignment is driven by the laminar infall of gas from sheets to filaments. When
compared with numerical simulations our results suggest that the connection
between DM halo and galaxy spin is not straightforward. Our results provide an

\emph{Fermi}/LAT, has a significantly different morphology compared to the
lower energy MeV emission, detected by \emph{Fermi}/GBM. Though the late time
GeV emission is believed to be synchrotron radiation produced via an external
shock, this emission as early as the prompt phase is puzzling. Meaningful
connection between these two emissions can be drawn only by an accurate
description of the prompt MeV spectrum. We perform a time-resolved spectroscopy
of the GBM data of long GRBs having significant GeV emission, using a model
consisting of 2 blackbodies and a power-law. We examine in detail the evolution
of the spectral components and found that GRBs having high GeV emission (GRB
090902B and GRB 090926A) have a delayed onset of the power-law component, in
the GBM spectrum, which lingers at the later part of the prompt emission. This
behaviour mimics the flux evolution in LAT. In contrast, bright GBM GRBs with
an order of magnitude lower GeV emission (GRB 100724B and GRB 091003) show a
coupled variability of the total and the power-law flux. Further, by analyzing
the data for a set of 17 GRBs, we find a strong correlation between the
power-law fluence in the MeV and the LAT fluence (Pearson correlation: r=0.88
and Spearman correlation: $\rho=0.81$). We demonstrate that this correlation is
not influenced by the correlation between the total and the power-law fluences
at a confidence level of 2.3$\sigma$. We speculate the possible radiation
mechanisms responsible for the correlation.

  v2: references added",,,,"hep-th gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This is a review of recent developments in the study of perturbative gauge
theory and gravity using action functionals on twistor space. It is intended to
provide a user-friendly introduction to twistor actions, geared towards
researchers or graduate students interested in learning something about the
utility, prospects, and shortcomings of this approach. For those already
familiar with the twistor approach, it should provide a condensed overview of
the literature as well as several novel results of potential interest. This
work is based primarily upon the author's D.Phil. thesis. We first consider
four-dimensional, maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory as a gauge theory
in twistor space. We focus on the perturbation theory associated to this
action, which in an axial gauge leads to the MHV formalism. This allows us to
efficiently compute scattering amplitudes at tree-level (and beyond) in twistor
space. Other gauge theory observables such as local operators and null
polygonal Wilson loops can also be formulated twistorially, leading to proofs
for several correspondences between correlation functions and Wilson loops, as
well as a recursive formula for computing mixed Wilson loop / local operator
correlators. We then apply the twistor action approach to general relativity,
using the on-shell equivalence between conformal and Einstein gravity. This can
be extended to N=4 supersymmetry. The perturbation theory of the twistor action
leads to formulae for the MHV amplitude with and without cosmological constant,
yields a candidate for the Einstein twistor action, and induces a MHV formalism
on twistor space. Appendices include discussion of super-connections and
Coulomb branch regularization on twistor space.

with a reservoir. One stems from the randomization of phases and the other from

hemispheric flux during the preceding minimum, which depends on how much flux
was present in each hemisphere at the start of the previous cycle and how much
net magnetic flux was transported across the equator during the cycle. Some of
this transport is associated with the random walk of magnetic flux tubes
subject to granular and supergranular buffeting, some of it is due to the
advection caused by systematic cross-equatorial flows such as those associated
with the inflows into active regions, and some crosses the equator during the
emergence process.
  We aim to determine how much of the cross-equatorial transport is due to
small-scale disorganized motions (treated as diffusion) compared with other
processes such as emergence flux across the equator. We measure the
cross-equatorial flux transport using Kitt Peak synoptic magnetograms,
estimating both the total and diffusive fluxes. Occasionally a large sunspot
group, with a large tilt angle emerges crossing the equator, with flux from the
two polarities in opposite hemispheres. The largest of these events carry a
substantial amount of flux across the equator (compared to the magnetic flux
near the poles). We call such events cross-equatorial flux plumes. There are
very few such large events during a cycle, which introduces an uncertainty into
the determination of the amount of magnetic flux transported across the equator
in any particular cycle. As the amount of flux which crosses the equator
determines the amount of net flux in each hemisphere, it follows that the
cross-equatorial plumes introduce an uncertainty in the prediction of the net
flux in each hemisphere. This leads to an uncertainty in predictions of the
strength of the following cycle.

battery capacities of the EH nodes, $B_{\rm max}$, satisfy $N\to\infty$ and
$B_{\rm max}\to\infty$. The considered family of utility functions is general
enough to include the most important performance measures in communication
theory such as the average data rate, outage probability, average bit error

solution is very simple. Namely, the asymptotically optimal power allocation
for the EH network is identical to the optimal power allocation for an
equivalent non-EH network whose nodes have infinite energy available but their
average transmit power is constrained to be equal to the average harvested
power and/or the maximum average transmit power of the corresponding nodes in
the EH network. Moreover, the maximum average performance of a general EH
network converges to the maximum average performance of the corresponding

energy transfer (WIET) in a multiple-input single-output (MISO) interference
channel (IFC). The design problem is to maximize the system throughput (i.e.,
the weighted sum rate) subject to individual energy harvesting constraints and
power constraints. Different from the conventional IFCs without energy
harvesting, the cross-link signals in the considered scenario play two opposite
roles in information detection (ID) and energy harvesting (EH). It is observed
that the ideal scheme, where the receivers can simultaneously perform ID and EH
from the received signal, may not always achieve the best tradeoff between
information transfer and energy harvesting, but simple practical schemes based
on time splitting may perform better. We therefore propose two practical time
splitting schemes, namely time division mode switching (TDMS) and time division
multiple access (TDMA), in addition to a power splitting (PS) scheme which
separates the received signal into two parts for ID and EH, respectively. In
the two-user scenario, we show that beamforming is optimal to all the schemes.
Moreover, the design problems associated with the TDMS and TDMA schemes admit
semi-analytical solutions. In the general K-user scenario, a successive convex
approximation method is proposed to handle the WIET problems associated with
the ideal scheme and the PS scheme, which are known to be NP-hard in general.
The K-user TDMS and TDMA schemes are shown efficiently solvable as convex
problems. Simulation results show that stronger cross-link channel powers
actually improve the information sum rate under energy harvesting constraints.
Moreover, none of the schemes under consideration can dominate another in terms
of the sum rate performance.

$p\in [1,\infty)$ and a metric space $(X,d_X)$, let $\gamma(A,d_X^p)$ be the
infimum over those $\gamma\in (0,\infty]$ for which every $x_1,...,x_n\in X$
satisfy $$ \frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^n d_X(x_i,x_j)^p\le
\frac{\gamma}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij} d_X(x_i,x_j)^p. $$
  Thus $\gamma(A,d_X^p)$ measures the magnitude of the {\em nonlinear spectral
gap} of the matrix $A$ with respect to the kernel $d_X^p:X\times X\to
[0,\infty)$. We study pairs of metric spaces $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y,d_Y)$ for which

\Psi(\gamma(A,d_Y^p))$ for every symmetric stochastic $A\in M_n(\R)$ with
$\gamma(A,d_Y^p)<\infty$. When $\Psi$ is linear a complete geometric
characterization is obtained.
  Our estimates on nonlinear spectral gaps yield new embeddability results as
well as new nonembeddability results. For example, it is shown that if $n\in
\N$ and $p\in (2,\infty)$ then for every $f_1,...,f_n\in L_p$ there exist
$x_1,...,x_n\in L_2$ such that {equation}\label{eq:p factor} \forall\, i,j\in

\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^n \|x_i-x_j\|_2^2=\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^n
\|f_i-f_j\|_p^2. $$
  This statement is impossible for $p\in [1,2)$, and the asymptotic dependence
on $p$ in \eqref{eq:p factor} is sharp. We also obtain the best known lower
bound on the $L_p$ distortion of Ramanujan graphs, improving over the work of
Matou\v{s}ek. Links to Bourgain--Milman--Wolfson type and a conjectural
nonlinear Maurey--Pisier theorem are studied.

consider probabilistic admixture or topic models in the overcomplete regime,
where the number of latent topics can greatly exceed the size of the observed
word vocabulary. While general overcomplete topic models are not identifiable,
we establish generic identifiability under a constraint, referred to as topic
persistence. Our sufficient conditions for identifiability involve a novel set
of ""higher order"" expansion conditions on the topic-word matrix or the
population structure of the model. This set of higher-order expansion
conditions allow for overcomplete models, and require the existence of a
perfect matching from latent topics to higher order observed words. We
establish that random structured topic models are identifiable w.h.p. in the
overcomplete regime. Our identifiability results allows for general
(non-degenerate) distributions for modeling the topic proportions, and thus, we
can handle arbitrarily correlated topics in our framework. Our identifiability
results imply uniqueness of a class of tensor decompositions with structured
sparsity which is contained in the class of Tucker decompositions, but is more

  In this paper, 2D fluid simulations are presented of this merging process in
order to understand the underlying physics, and better interpret the
experimental data. These simulations examine the individual and combined
effects of tight-aspect ratio geometry and two-fluid physics on the merging.
The ideal self-driven flux-rope dynamics are coupled to the diffusion layer
physics, resulting in a large range of phenomena. For resistive MHD
simulations, the flux-ropes enter the sloshing regime for normalised
resistivity eta < 1E-5. In Hall-MHD three regimes are found for the qualitative
behaviour of the current sheet, depending on the ratio of the current sheet
width to the ion-sound radius. These are a stable collisional regime, an open
X-point regime, and an intermediate regime that is highly unstable to
tearing-type instabilities.
  In toroidal axisymmetric geometry, the final state after merging is a
MAST-like spherical tokamak with nested flux-surfaces. It is also shown that
the evolution of simulated 1D radial density profiles closely resembles the
Thomson scattering electron density measurements in MAST. An intuitive
explanation for the origin of the measured density structures is proposed,

surrounded by a multiplicative log-normal noise. We have observed that this
pattern is quite similar to those previously-reported for the relationships
between the number candidates (mayor and councillor) and population of voters

the engagement in the electoral processes. We also note that the power law
exponents display a clear hierarchy, where the more influential is the
political position the smaller is the value of the exponent. We have also
investigated the probability distributions of the number of candidates (mayor
and councilor), party memberships and voters. The results indicate that the
most influential positions are characterized by distributions with very
short-tails, while less influential positions display an intermediate power law
decay before showing an exponential-like cutoff. We discuss that, in addition
to the political power of the position, limitations in the number of available
seats can also be connected with this changing of behavior. We further believe
that our empirical findings point out to an underrepresentation effect, where

Using a combination of ILPs and dynamic programming we manage to design FPT
algorithms for Coloring and Partitioning into paths (and hence Hamiltonian path
and Hamiltonian cycle), which are W-hard for both clique-width and its recently
introduced restriction, shrub-depth. We thus argue that modular-width occupies

083008 (2011)] and [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 081102 (2012)]. In this paper, we
investigate the existence and evolution of Dirac dynamical resonance states.
First we look for stationary resonance states of a Dirac field around a
Schwarzchild black hole by using the Schr\""{o}dinger-like equations reduced
from the Dirac equation in Schwarzschild spacetime. Then Dirac
pseudo-stationary configurations are constructed from the stationary resonance
states. We use these configurations as initial data and investigate their
numerical evolutions and energy decay. These dynamical solutions are the
so-called ""Dirac dynamical resonance states"". It is found that the energy of
the Dirac dynamical resonance states shows an exponential decay. The decay rate
of energy is affected by the resonant frequency, the mass of Dirac field, the
total angular momentum, and the spin-orbit interaction. In particular, for
ultra-light Dirac field, the corresponding particles can stay around a
Schwarzschild black hole for a very long time, even for cosmological
time-scales.

be formulated as either a nonlinear eigenvalue or direct minimization problem.
The most widely used approach for solving the former is the so-called
self-consistent field (SCF) iteration. A common observation is that the
convergence of SCF is not clear theoretically while approaches with convergence
guarantee for solving the latter are often not competitive to SCF numerically.
In this paper, we study gradient type methods for solving the direct
minimization problem by constructing new iterations along the gradient on the
Stiefel manifold. Global convergence (i.e., convergence to a stationary point
from any initial solution) as well as local convergence rate follows from the
standard theory for optimization on manifold directly. A major computational
advantage is that the computation of linear eigenvalue problems is no longer
needed. The main costs of our approaches arise from the assembling of the total
energy functional and its gradient and the projection onto the manifold. These
tasks are cheaper than eigenvalue computation and they are often more suitable
for parallelization as long as the evaluation of the total energy functional
and its gradient is efficient. Numerical results show that they can outperform
SCF consistently on many practically large systems.

temperature gradient, provided the quasiparticle mean free path is smaller than
the scale of variation of temperature. When mean free paths are comparable to
sample size, the relation becomes non-local. This non-local relation is
formulated for phonon carriers; an explicit form is found in the approximation
where current relaxation rates are replaced by quasiparticle relaxation rates.
A quasiparticle definition of local temperature is offered. To extract the
spatial variation of the temperature gradient requires inverting the non-local
relation. A variational principle is constructed. The heat current is bounded
above when evaluated for a trial temperature gradient. The true temperature
gradient is the one which minimizes heat current. The simplest variational
approximation (a constant temperature gradient) gives an approximate formula
for the thickness dependence of the heat transport across a film whose
thickness is comparable to mean free paths of phonons. The formula interpolates

error performance of maximum likelihood (ML) decoding. But the complexity of
the conventional sphere decoder is still high, where the candidates in a target
sphere are enumerated and the radius is decreased gradually until no available
candidate is in the sphere. In order to reduce the complexity of SD, a stack SD
(SSD) algorithm with an efficient enumeration is proposed in this paper. Based
on a novel path metric, SSD can effectively narrow the search range when
enumerating the candidates within a sphere. The proposed metric follows an
exact ML rule and takes the full usage of the whole received sequence.
Furthermore, another very simple metric is provided as an approximation of the
ML metric in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime. For short polar codes,
simulation results over the additive white Gaussian noise channels show that
the complexity of SSD based on the proposed metrics is up to 100 times lower

becomes unstable, leading to the formation of spatially periodic digits of air

solve the resulting shape equations to elucidate the three-dimensional droplet

been imaged from above, but their full side-on view has not been observed and
reported for current optical configurations. This experimental limitation
points to ambiguity in differentiating between droplets having the same

important challenges currently facing mankind. Wind has made an increasing
contribution to the world's energy supply mix, but still remains a long way
from reaching its full potential. In this paper, we investigate the use of
artificial evolution to design vertical-axis wind turbine prototypes that are
physically instantiated and evaluated under fan generated wind conditions.
Initially a conventional evolutionary algorithm is used to explore the design
space of a single wind turbine and later a cooperative coevolutionary algorithm
is used to explore the design space of an array of wind turbines. Artificial
neural networks are used throughout as surrogate models to assist learning and
found to reduce the number of fabrications required to reach a higher
aerodynamic efficiency. Unlike in other approaches, such as computational fluid
dynamics simulations, no mathematical formulations are used and no model
assumptions are made.

dark energy may lead to a violation of the null energy condition and to the
formation of a configuration with nontrivial topology (a wormhole). In this it
is assumed that both dark matter and dark energy satisfy the null energy
condition, a violation of which takes place only in the inner high-density
regions of the configuration. This is achieved by assuming that, in a
high-density environment, a nonminimal coupling function changes its sign in
comparison with the case where dark matter and dark energy have relatively low
densities which are typical for a cosmological background. For this case, we
find regular static, spherically symmetric solutions describing wormholes
supported by dark matter nonminimally coupled to dark energy in the form of a
quintessence scalar field.

selected by a volunteer. We give a mathematical explanation of why the
well-known 21-card trick works using a simple linear discrete function. The
function has a stable fixed point which corresponds to the position where the
selected card reaches at the end of the trick. We then generalize the 21(7 x
3)-card trick to a p x q - card trick where p and q are odd integers greater
than or equal to three, determine the fixed point and prove that it is also
stable.

several partitions that maximize the weighted sum of the partition values with
varying weights, instead of a single one.

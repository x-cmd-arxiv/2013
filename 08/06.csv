  magnetic fields","7 pages, 9 figures, accepted by AN",,,,"physics.flu-dyn astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The instability of a supercritical Taylor-Couette flow of a conducting fluid
with resting outer cylinder under the influence of a uniform axial electric
current is investigated for magnetic Prandtl number Pm=1. In the linear theory
the critical Reynolds number for axisymmetric perturbations is not influenced
by the current-induced axisymmetric magnetic field but all axisymmetric
magnetic perturbations decay. The nonaxisymmetric perturbations with m=1 are
excited even without rotation for large enough Hartmann numbers (""Tayler
instability""). For slow rotation their growth rates scale with the Alfv\'en
frequency of the magnetic field but for fast rotation they scale with the
rotation rate of the inner cylinder. In the nonlinear regime the ratio of the
energy of the magnetic m=1 modes and the toroidal background field is very low
for the non-rotating Tayler instability but it strongly grows if differential
rotation is present. For super-Alfv\'enic rotation the energies in the m=1
modes of flow and field do not depend on the molecular viscosity, they are
almost in equipartition and contain only 1.5% of the centrifugal energy of the
inner cylinder. The geometry of the excited magnetic field pattern is strictly
nonaxisymmetric for slow rotation but it is of the mixed-mode type for fast
rotation -- contrary to the situation which has been observed at the surface of
Ap stars.

near-real-time fashion has become a crucial prerequisite for many scientific
and industrial use cases in recent years. While the individual data streams are
usually trivial to process, their aggregated data volumes easily exceed the
scalability of traditional stream processing systems. At the same time,
massively-parallel data processing systems like MapReduce or Dryad currently
enjoy a tremendous popularity for data-intensive applications and have proven
to scale to large numbers of nodes. Many of these systems also provide
streaming capabilities. However, unlike traditional stream processors, these
systems have disregarded QoS requirements of prospective stream processing
applications so far. In this paper we address this gap. First, we analyze
common design principles of today's parallel data processing frameworks and
identify those principles that provide degrees of freedom in trading off the
QoS goals latency and throughput. Second, we propose a highly distributed
scheme which allows these frameworks to detect violations of user-defined QoS
constraints and optimize the job execution without manual interaction. As a
proof of concept, we implemented our approach for our massively-parallel data
processing framework Nephele and evaluated its effectiveness through a
comparison with Hadoop Online. For an example streaming application from the
multimedia domain running on a cluster of 200 nodes, our approach improves the
processing latency by a factor of at least 13 while preserving high data
throughput when needed.

magnetic order, and the structural and magnetic excitations, plays an active
role in investigating various families of Fe-based high-Tc superconductors.
Three different types of antiferromag- netic orders have been discovered in the
Fe plane, but two of them cannot be explained by the spin-density-wave (SDW)
mechanism of nesting Fermi surfaces. Noticing the close relation between
antiferromagnetic order and lattice distortion in orbital ordering from
previous studies on manganites and other oxides, we have advocated orbital or-
dering as the underlying common mechanism for the structural and
antiferromagnetic transitions in the 1111, 122 and 11 parent compounds. We
observe the coexistence of antiferromagnetic order and superconductivity in the
(Ba,K)Fe2 As2 system, when its phase separation is generally accepted. Optimal
Tc is proposed to be controlled by the local FeAs4 tetrahedron from our
investigation on the 1111 materials. The Bloch phase coherence of the Fermi
liquid is found crucial to the occurrence of bulk superconductiv- ity in iron
chalcogenides of both the 11 and the 245 families. Iron chalcogenides carry a
larger staggered magnetic moment (> 2{\mu}B /Fe) than that in iron pnictides (<
1{\mu}B /Fe) in the antiferromagnetic order. Normal state magnetic excitations
in the 11 supercon- ductor are of the itinerant nature while in the 245
superconductor the spin-waves of localized moments. The observation of
superconducting resonance peak provides a cru- cial piece of information in
current deliberation of the pairing symmetry in Fe-based superconductors.

FNS and HOC and include the use of quenched or unquenched values for the axial

Equivalent effects of some of these approximations are also possible, which may
lead (accidentally) to close final results. We found that the cummulative
effect of all these nuclear ingredients on the calculated nuclear matrix
elements NMEs is significant. Since the NMEs values are often obtained with
different approximations and/or with different input parameters, a convergent

provide a comprehensive analysis for three-player two-action games, which is
the minimum system size with nontrivial structural dynamics. In particular, we
characterize the Nash equilibria (NE) in such games and examine the local
stability of the rest points corresponding to those equilibria. We also study
general n-player networks via both simulations and analytical methods and find
that in the absence of exploration, the stable equilibria consist of star
motifs as the main building blocks of the network. Furthermore, in all stable
equilibria the agents play pure strategies, even when the game allows mixed NE.
Finally, we study the impact of exploration on learning outcomes, and observe
that there is a critical exploration rate above which the symmetric and
uniformly connected network topology becomes stable.

Lagrangians) without constraints is presented. A partial Hamiltonian formalism
in the phase space having an initially arbitrary number of momenta (which can
be smaller than the number of velocities) is proposed. The equations of motion
become first-order differential equations, and they coincide with those of
multi-time dynamics, if a certain condition is imposed. In a singular theory,
this condition is fulfilled in the case of the coincidence of the number of
generalized momenta with the rank of the Hessian matrix. The noncanonical
generalized velocities satisfy a system of linear algebraic equations, which
allows an appropriate classification of singular theories (gauge and nongauge).
A new antisymmetric bracket (similar to the Poisson bracket) is introduced,
which describes the time evolution of physical quantities in a singular theory.
The origin of constraints is shown to be a consequence of the (unneeded in our
formulation) extension of the phase space. In this case the new bracket
transforms into the Dirac bracket. Quantization is briefly discussed.

functional theory (TDDFT) to reproduce the main results. By means of
conventional and long-range corrected exchange correlation functionals, the
luminescence energies and the exciton localization were calculated for a
triphenylene homopolymer and several different copolymers. The phosphorescence
energy of the pure triphenylene chain is predicted accurately by means of the
optimally tuned long-range corrected LC-PBE functional and slightly less
accurate by the global hybrid B3LYP. However, the experimentally observed fixed
phosphorescence energy could not be reproduced because the localization pattern
is different to the expectations: Instead of localizing on the triphenylene
moiety - which is present in all types of polymers - the triplet state
localizes on the different bridging units in the TDDFT calculations. This leads
to different triplet emission energies for each type of polymer. Yet, there are
clear indications that long-range corrected TDDFT has the potential to predict
the triplet emission energies as well as the localization behavior more
accurate than conventional local or semi-local functionals.

common tool and numerous simulation models are widely used as 'benchmark'. In
the simulation, the continuous time dynamic system is converted into a
discrete-time recursive system. As a result of this, the state indeed evolves
by Markov transitions in the simulation rather than in continuous time. One
significant issue involved with modeling of the system from practice to
simulation is that the simulation parameter, particularly e.g. the state Markov
transition noise, needs to match the iteration period of the filter. Otherwise,
the simulation performance may be far from the truth. Unfortunately, quite
commonly different-speed filters are evaluated and compared under the same
simulation model with the same state transition noise for simplicity regardless
of their real sampling periods. Here the note primarily aims at clarifying this
problem and point out that it is very necessary to use a proper simulation
noise that matches the filter's speed for evaluation and comparison under the

incompressible, vertically stratified Keplerian discs with a weak vertical
magnetic field in the shearing box approximation. Perturbations are decomposed
into shearing waves whose evolution is followed via numerical integration of
the linearized ideal MHD equations. There are two basic modes in the system --
inertia-gravity waves and magnetic mode, which displays the magnetorotational
instability (MRI). As distinct from previous studies, we introduce
`eigenvariables' characterizing each (counter-propagating) component of the
inertia-gravity and magnetic modes, which are governed by a set of four first
order coupled ordinary differential equations. This allowed us to identify a
new process of linear coupling of the two above non-axisymmetric modes due to
the disc's differential rotation. We did a comparative analysis of the dynamics
of non-axisymmetric and axisymmetric magnetic mode perturbations. It is shown
that the growth of optimal and close-to-optimal non-axisymmetric harmonics of
this mode, having transient nature, can prevail over the exponential growth of
axisymmetric ones (i.e., over the axisymmetric MRI) during dynamical time. A
possible implication of this result for axisymmetric channel solutions is
discussed. Specifically, the formation of the channel may be affected/impeded
by non-axisymmetric modes already at the early linear stage leading to its
untimely disruption -- the outcome strongly depends on the amplitude and
spectrum of initial perturbation. So, this competition may result in an
uncertainty in the magnetic mode's non-linear dynamics. It is also shown that a
maximum non-axisymmetric growth is at vertical wavelengths close to the
scale-height for which compressibility effects are important. This indirectly
suggests that compressibility plays a role in the dynamics of the
non-axisymmetric MRI.

formulation of quantum field theory in curved space time. In this paper, the
topological and bornological properties of $D'_\Gamma$ and its dual
$E'_\Lambda$ are investigated. It is found that $D'_\Gamma$ is a nuclear,
semi-reflexive and semi-Montel complete normal space of distributions. Its
strong dual $E'_\Lambda$ is a nuclear, barrelled and bornological normal space
of distributions which, however, is not even sequentially complete. Concrete
rules are given to determine whether a distribution belongs to $D'_\Gamma$,
whether a sequence converges in $D'_\Gamma$ and whether a set of distributions
is bounded in $D'_\Gamma$.

of the Berends-Giele relations. These recursion relations on the light-front

every particle, such as $\phi(t_1,x_1,\ldots,t_N,x_N)$. They arise as a
relativistic analog of the wave functions of quantum mechanics but can be
applied also in quantum field theory. The evolution of a wave function with N
time variables is governed by N Schr\""odinger equations, one for each time
variable. These Schr\""odinger equations can be inconsistent with each other,
i.e., they can fail to possess a joint solution for every initial condition; in
fact, the N Hamiltonians need to satisfy a certain commutator condition in
order to be consistent. While this condition is automatically satisfied for
non-interacting particles, it is a challenge to set up consistent multi-time
equations with interaction. We prove for a wide class of multi-time
Schr\""odinger equations that the presence of interaction potentials (given by
multiplication operators) leads to inconsistency. We conclude that interaction
has to be implemented instead by creation and annihilation of particles, which,
in fact, can be done consistently, as we show elsewhere [17]. We also prove the
following result: When a cut-off length $\delta>0$ is introduced (in the sense
that the multi-time wave function is defined only on a certain set of spacelike
configurations, thereby breaking Lorentz invariance), then the multi-time
Schr\""odinger equations with interaction potentials of range $\delta$ are
consistent; however, in the desired limit $\delta\to 0$ of removing the
cut-off, the resulting multi-time equations are interaction-free, which
supports the conclusion expressed in the title.

information, combined with what offers the most information gain. Where GCTA
differs from an adaptive trial, or, for that matter, from any trial design, is
that all patients are implicitly participants in the GCTA process, regardless

the theoretical and practical issues that arise in the design of a GCTA, along

universally spans the Fermi level on four distinct surface morphologies despite
shifts in the f band energy. Using a cotunneling model, we separate the density
of states of the hybridized bands from which the predicted topological surface

while limiting harm to healthy cells. However, the inherent variance among
cells in both cancer and healthy cell populations increases the difficulty of
selective drug action. Here we propose a classification framework based on the
idea that an ideal cancer drug should maximally discriminate between cancer and
healthy cells. We first explore how molecular markers can be used to
discriminate cancer cells from healthy cells on a single cell basis, and then
how the effects of drugs are statistically predicted by these molecular
markers. We then combine these two ideas to show how to optimally match drugs
to tumor cells. We find that expression levels of a handful of genes suffice to
discriminate well between individual cells in cancer and healthy tissue. We
also find that gene expression predicts the efficacy of cancer drugs,
suggesting that the cancer drugs act as classifiers using gene profiles. In
agreement with our first finding, a small number of genes predict drug efficacy
well. Finally, we formulate a framework that defines an optimal drug, and
predicts drug cocktails that may target cancer more accurately than the
individual drugs alone. Conceptualizing cancer drugs as solving a
discrimination problem in the high-dimensional space of molecular markers
promises to inform the design of new cancer drugs and drug cocktails.

candidates of 1, 2 and 5 keV and compare results with pure cold dark matter
simulations. WDM slightly reduces star formation and produces less centrally
concentrated stellar profiles. These effects are most evident for the 1 keV
candidate but almost disappear for $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}>2$ keV. All simulations
form similar stellar discs independent of WDM particle mass. In particular, the
disc scale length does not change when WDM is considered. The reduced amount of
star formation in the case of 1 keV particles is due to the effects of WDM on
merging satellites which are on average less concentrated and less gas rich.
The altered satellites cause a reduced starburst during mergers because they
trigger weaker disc instabilities in the main galaxy. Nevertheless we show that
disc galaxy evolution is much more sensitive to stellar feedback than it is to
WDM candidate mass. Overall we find that WDM, especially when restricted to
current observational constraints ($m_{\mathrm{WDM}}>2$ keV), has a minor
impact on disc galaxy formation.

galaxy clustering measurements, in which the distant-observer approximation is
often adopted. Using the full wide-angle formula for computing the
redshift-space correlation function, we show that compared to the sample
variance, the deviation in the redshift-space correlation function from the
simple Kaiser formula with the distant-observer approximation is negligible in
galaxy surveys such as the SDSS, Euclid and the BigBOSS, if the theoretical
prediction from the Kaiser formula is properly averaged over the survey volume.
We also find corrections to the wide-angle formula and clarify the confusion in
literature between the wide angle effect and the velocity contribution in
galaxy clustering. However, when the FKP method is applied, substantial
deviations can be present in the power spectrum analysis in future surveys, due
to the non-uniform distribution of galaxy pairs.

We exhibit two main calculations where this point of view is useful. First,
based on the scale covariance, we show that the structure of higher curvature
corrections to Einstein's equation is very simple. Second, in the context of
accelerated FRW cosmologies, also known as Q-space, we begin by calculating the
Bunch-Davies wavefunctional for a massless scalar field and considering its
interpretation as a generating functional of correlation functions of a
holographic dual. We use this to conjecture a Q-space/QFT duality, a natural
extension of dS/CFT, and argue that the Euclidean dual theory violates
hyperscaling. This proposal, when extended to epochs in our own cosmological
history like matter or radiation domination, suggests a holographically dual
description via RG phases which violate hyperscaling. We further use the
wavefunctional to compute Anninos-Denef overlaps and show that the ultrametric
structure discovered for de Sitter becomes sharper in accelerated FRW
cosmologies as the acceleration slows. The substitution $d -->
d_{eff}=d-\theta$ permeates and illuminates the discussion of wavefunctionals
and overlaps in FRW cosmologies, allowing one to predict the sharpened
structure. We try to find an alternate manifestation of this ultrametric
structure by studying the connection of the $\theta --> -\infty$ background to
little string theory.

two-dimensional extension of the two-point correlation function averaged within
a certain volume in phase space. This statistics is a sensitive measure of
small scale (sub-)structure of dark matter haloes. By analysing the structure
of $P^2SAD$ in Milky-Way-size haloes using the Aquarius simulations, we find it
to be nearly universal at small scales, i.e. small separations in phase space,
where substructures dominate. This remarkable universality occurs across time
and in regions of substantially different ambient densities (by nearly four
orders of magnitude), with typical variations in $P^2SAD$ of a factor of a few.
The maximum variations occur in regions where substructures have been strongly
disrupted. The universality is also preserved across haloes of similar mass but
diverse mass accretion histories and subhalo distributions. The universality is
also broken at large scales, where the smooth dark matter distribution in the
halo dominates. Although at small scales the structure of $P^2SAD$ is roughly
described by a subhalo model, we argue that the simulation data is better
fitted by a family of superellipse contours. This functional shape is inspired
by a model that extends the stable clustering hypothesis into phase space. In a
companion paper, we refine this model and show its advantages as a method to
obtain predictions for non-gravitational signatures of dark matter.

and show various spectral features including Halpha and the UV dust bump at

synthesis models, while exploring attenuation curves with varying slopes and UV
bump strengths. The Milky Way and Calzetti law provide poor fits at UV
wavelengths for nearly all SEDs. Consistent with previous studies, we find that
the best-fit attenuation law varies with spectral type. There is a strong
correlation between the best-fit dust slope and UV bump strength, with steeper
laws having stronger bumps. Moreover, the attenuation curve correlates with
specific star formation rate (SFR), with more active galaxies having shallower
dust curves and weaker bumps. There is also a weak correlation with
inclination. The observed trends can be explained by differences in the
dust-to-star geometry, a varying grain size distribution, or a combination of
both. Our results have several implications for galaxy evolution studies.
First, the assumption of a universal dust model leads to biases in derived
galaxy properties. Second, the presence of a dust bump may result in
underestimated values for the UV slope, used to correct SFRs of distant
galaxies.

in absorption against 105 quasars at z~3 using the blue sensitive MagE
spectrograph at the Magellan Clay telescope. By searching for Lyman limit
absorption in the wavelength range ~3000-4000A, we measure the number of LLSs
per unit redshift l(z)=1.21+/-0.28 at z~2.8. Using a stacking analysis, we
further estimate the mean free path of ionizing photons in the z~3 Universe
lambda^912 = 100+/-29 Mpc/h_70.4. Combined with our LLS survey, we conclude
that systems with log N_HI >= 17.5 cm^-2 contribute only ~40% to the observed
mean free path at these redshifts. Further, with the aid of photo-ionization
modeling, we infer that a population of ionized and metal poor systems is
likely required to reproduce the metal line strengths observed in a composite
spectrum of 20 LLSs with N_HI = 17.5-19 cm^-2 at z~2.6-3.0. Finally, with a
simple toy model, we deduce that gas in the halos of galaxies can alone account
for the totality of LLSs at z<~3, but a progressively higher contribution from
the intergalactic medium is required beyond z~3.5. We also show how the weakly
evolving number of LLSs per unit redshift at z<~3 can be modeled either by
requiring that the spatial extent of the circumgalactic medium is redshift
invariant in the last ~10 Gyr of cosmic evolution or by postulating that LLSs
arise in halos that are rare fluctuations in the density field at each
redshift.

nonlinear regions where WDM structure formation takes place are shown and
compared to those in CDM: the WDM non-linear structures start to form later
than in CDM, and as a general trend, decreasing the DM particle mass delays the
onset of the non-linear regime. The non-linear regime starts earlier for
smaller objects than for larger ones; smaller objects can form earlier both in
WDM and CDM. We compute and analyze the differential mass function dN/dM for
WDM at redshift z in the Press-Schechter approach. The WDM suppression effect
of small scale structure increases with the redshift z. Our results for dN/dM
are useful to be contrasted with observations, in particular for 4 < z < 12. We
perfom all these studies for the most popular WDM particle physics models.

Curiosity often motivates creative, innovative people. To encourage such

In the I=1, J=1 channel and far from the critical mass value $m_c$ the energy
gap roughly follows the bare value $m$ (vector mesons). In approaching the
critical value $m_c$ at $\beta$ fixed, there is a bifurcation of the energy
gap: one branch follows the value $m$, while the new is much larger and it
shows a more and more dominant weight. This phenomenon might be the sign of two
important features: the long range correlation near the fixed point at $\beta
\to \infty$ implied by the low energy gap and the screening (or confining)
mechanisms across the $m=m_c$ associated to the larger gap. The I=0, J=0,1 gaps
are of the same order of magnitude, typically larger than the I=1, J=1 gap (for
$m>>m_c$). For $m\sim m_c$ both I=0 gaps have a dramatic drop with minima near

distances have been touted as sensitive probes of Lorentz invariance violation
(LIV) and of theories of quantum gravity. Frequency-dependent time lags between
simultaneously emitted pulses of light can signal a modification in the photon
dispersion relation; however, matter engenders the cosmos with a dispersive
index of refraction to similar effect. We construct a theoretical framework for
the analysis of such effects, contrasting these dispersive terms with those
from LIV models. We consider all matter, both luminous and dark. Though the
only known mode of interaction for dark matter (DM) is gravitational, most
models of dark matter also allow for electromagnetic interactions, if only at
the one-loop level in perturbation theory. Generically, the leading order
dispersive effects due to matter scale with photon energy as \omega^{-2} for a
charged DM candidate and \omega^2 for a neutral DM candidate. Terms linear in
\omega can arise in the index of refraction if parity and charge-parity
asymmetries are present at the Lagrangian or system level. Herein, we compute
the index of refraction for a millicharged dark matter candidate at the
one-loop level, a neutral scalar DM candidate introduced by Boehm and Fayet,
and the MSSM's neutralino. For a neutral DM candidate, we determine that matter
effects can compete with LIV effects that depend quadratically on energy
whenever the photon energy is beyond 10^{29} GeV, well beyond the GZK cutoff.
The dispersive matter effects that scale linearly with \omega are model
dependent, and their existence results in circular birefringence.

quantum field theory, from gauge theory to string theory -- singularities in
the complex Borel plane, usually associated to instantons or renormalons,
render perturbation theory ill-defined as they give rise to nonperturbative
ambiguities. These ambiguities are associated to choices of an integration
contour in the resummation of perturbation theory, along (singular) Stokes
directions in the complex Borel plane (rendering perturbative expansions
non-Borel summable along any Stokes line). More recently, it has been shown
that the proper framework to address these issues is that of resurgent analysis
and transseries. In this context, the cancelation of all nonperturbative
ambiguities is shown to be a consequence of choosing the transseries median
resummation as the appropriate family of unambiguous real solutions along the
coupling-constant real axis. While the median resummation is easily implemented
for one-parameter transseries, once one considers more general multi-parameter
transseries the procedure becomes highly dependent upon properly understanding
Stokes transitions in the complex Borel plane. In particular, all Stokes
coefficients must now be known in order to explicitly implement multi-parameter
median resummations. In the cases where quantum-theoretical physical
observables are described by resurgent functions and transseries, the methods
described herein show how one may cancel nonperturbative ambiguities, and
define these observables nonperturbatively starting out from perturbation
theory. Along the way, structural results concerning resurgent transseries are

location for a specific purpose and lasting for short period of time, relying
on mobile social media such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and
Bluetooth devices. The primary purpose of people in the OffESNs is to acquire
and share information via attending prescheduled events. Event Recommendation
over this kind of networks can facilitate attendees on selecting the
prescheduled events and organizers on making resource planning. However,
because of lack of users preference and rating information, as well as explicit
social relations, both rating based traditional recommendation methods and
social-trust based recommendation methods can no longer work well to recommend
events in the OffESNs. To address the challenges such as how to derive users
latent preferences and social relations and how to fuse the latent information
in a unified model, we first construct two heterogeneous interaction social
networks, an event participation network and a physical proximity network.
Then, we use them to derive users latent preferences and latent networks on
social relations, including like-minded peers, co-attendees and friends.
Finally, we propose an LNF (Latent Networks Fusion) model under a pairwise
factor graph to infer event attendance probabilities for recommendation.
Experiments on an RFID-based real conference dataset have demonstrated the
effectiveness of the proposed model compared with typical solutions.

three-component merging supercluster, RCS 231953+00, at z=0.9. The brightest
submillimetre galaxy (SMG) in the field (S_850=12mJy) is within 30"" of one of
the cluster cores (RCS 2319-C), and is likely to be a more distant, lensed
galaxy. Interestingly, the wider field around RCS 2319-C reveals a local
overdensity of SMGs, exceeding the average source density by a factor of 4.5,
with a <1 per cent chance of being found in a random field. Utilizing
Herschel-SPIRE observations, we find three of these SMGs have similar
submillimetre colours. We fit their observed 250-850um spectral energy
distributions to estimate their redshift, yielding 2.5<z<3.5, and calculate
prodigious star formation rates (SFRs) ranging from 500-2500 solar masses per
year. We speculate that these galaxies are either lensed SMGs, or signpost a
physical structure at z~3: a 'protocluster' inhabited by young galaxies in a
rapid phase of growth, destined to form the core of a massive galaxy cluster by
z=0.

Malliavin matrix ([11]) for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) force by
degenerate stable like noises. For the degenerate SDEs driven by Wiener noises,
one can derive a Norris type lemma and use it \emph{iteratively} to prove the
smoothness of density functions. Unfortunately, Norris type lemma is very hard
to be iteratively applied to SDEs with stable like noises. In this paper, we
derive a simple inequality as a replacement and use it to show that two
families of degenerate SDEs with stable like noises admit smooth density
functions. One family is the linear SDEs studied by Priola and Zabczyk ([13]),
under some additional assumption we can iteratively use the inequality to get
the smoothness of the density. The other family is the general SDEs with stable
like noises, we can apply this inequality only \emph{one} time and thus derive
that the SDEs admit smooth density if the \emph{first} order Lie brackets span
$\R^d$. The crucial step in this paper is estimating the smallest eigenvalue of
the simplified Malliavin matrix, which only uses some elementary facts of
Poisson processes and undergraduate level ordinary differential equations.

color ratio images obtained by the FC and presents a red spectral slope. The
orange material deposits can be classified into three types, a) diffuse ejecta
deposited by recent medium-size impact craters (such as Oppia), b) lobate
patches with well-defined edges, and c) ejecta rays from fresh-looking impact
craters. The location of the orange diffuse ejecta from Oppia corresponds to
the olivine spot nicknamed ""Leslie feature"" first identified by Gaffey (1997)
from ground-based spectral observations. The distribution of the orange
material in the FC mosaic is concentrated on the equatorial region and almost
exclusively outside the Rheasilvia basin. Our in-depth analysis of the
composition of this material uses complementary observations from FC, the

$2^{-N^{0.5-\epsilon}}$, the frame error probability of Arikan's polar codes.
The proposed concatenated polar codes and Arikan's polar codes are also

sufficient condition on the length of erasure burst which guarantees failure of
the polar decoder. On the other hand, it is shown that the parameters of the

rate matches the behavior of the minimax risk of function estimation in
regression problems under the well-specified model. This yields a conclusion
that the rates of statistical estimation in well-specified models (minimax
risk) and in misspecified models (minimax regret) are equivalent in the regime
$p\in(0,2)$. In other words, for $p\in(0,2)$ the problem of statistical
learning enjoys the same minimax rate as the problem of statistical estimation.

general, slower than for the minimax risk. Our oracle inequalities also imply
the $v\log(n/v)/n$ rates for Vapnik-Chervonenkis type classes of dimension $v$

properties of the correlation coefficients, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors of
the correlation matrices are carefully analyzed. We find that the stock
correlations are significantly increased in the periods of two market crashes
in 2001 and 2008, during which only five eigenvalues significantly deviate from
the random correlation matrix, and the systemic risk is higher in these
volatile periods than calm periods. By investigating the significant
contributors of the deviating eigenvectors in different moving windows, we
observe a dynamic evolution behavior in business sectors such as IT,
electronics, and real estate, which lead the rise (drop) before (after) the
crashes.

spectrum distribution in the cosmology. The background-field formalism is fully
used. Stimulated by the recent idea of the {\it emergent} gravity, the
gravitational (metric) field $g_\mn$ is not taken as the quantum-field, but as
the background field. The statistical fluctuation effect of the metric field is
taken into account by the path (hyper-surface)-integral over the space-time.
Using a simple scalar model on the curved (dS$_4$) space-time, we explain the
above things with the following additional points: 1) Clear separate treatment
of the classical effect, the statistical effect and the quantum effect; 2) The
cosmological fluctuation comes not from the 'quantum' gravity but from the
unkown 'microscopic' movement; 3) IR parameter ($\ell$) is introduced for the
time axis as the periodicity. Time reversal(Z$_2$)-symmetry is introduced in
order to treat the problem separately with respect to the Z$_2$ parity. This
procedure much helps both UV and IR regularization to work well.

Vector Classifier, a widely used general classifier, is applied to build and
test the prediction models. Several classical verification measures are adopted
to assess the quality of the predictions. We investigate different flare levels
within various time windows, and thus it is possible to estimate the rough
classes and erupting times of flares for particular active regions. Several
combinations of predictors have been tested in the experiments. The True Skill
Statistics are higher than 0.36 in 97% of cases and the Heidke Skill Scores
range from 0.23 to 0.48. The predictors derived from longitudinal magnetic
fields do perform well, however they are less sensitive in predicting large
flares. Employing the nonpotentiality predictors from vector fields improves
the performance of predicting large flares of magnitude $\geq$M5.0 and

from the interior pass through them into the atmosphere, changing their nature

partially reflect and partially mode convert to upgoing and downgoing Alfv\'en

metric spaces, but they often reduce to intractable combinatorial problems. In
this paper we study more quantitative versions of these inequalities involving
the so-called $p$-negative type gap. In particular, we focus our attention on
the class of finite ultrametric spaces which are important in areas such as
phylogenetics and data mining.
  Let $(X,d)$ be a given finite ultrametric space with minimum non-zero
distance $\alpha$. Then the $p$-negative type gap $\Gamma_{X}(p)$ of $(X,d)$ is
positive for all $p \geq 0$. In this paper we compute the value of the limit
\begin{eqnarray*} \Gamma_{X}(\infty) & = & \lim\limits_{p \rightarrow \infty}
\frac{\Gamma_{X}(p)}{\alpha^{p}}. \end{eqnarray*} It turns out that this value
is positive and it may be given explicitly by an elegant combinatorial formula.
On the basis of our calculations we are then able to characterize when
$\Gamma_{X}(p)/ \alpha^{p}$ is constant on $[0, \infty)$.
  The determination of $\Gamma_{X}(\infty)$ also leads to new, asymptotically
sharp, families of enhanced $p$-negative type inequalities for $(X,d)$. Indeed,
suppose that $G \in (0, \Gamma_{X}(\infty))$. Then, for all sufficiently large
$p$, we have \begin{eqnarray*} \frac{G \cdot \alpha^{p}}{2} \left(
\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} |\zeta_{k}| \right)^{2} + \sum\limits_{j,i =1}^{n}

data that incorporates both spectral and contextual characteristics of a

is to partition the pixels of a hyperspectral image into a number of spatial
neighborhoods called contextual groups and to model each pixel with a linear
combination of a few dictionary elements learned from the data. Since pixels
inside a contextual group are often made up of the same materials, their linear
combinations are constrained to use common elements from the dictionary. To
this end, dictionary learning is carried out with a joint sparse regularizer to
induce a common sparsity pattern in the sparse coefficients of each contextual
group. The sparse coefficients are then used for classification using a linear
SVM. Experimental results on a number of real hyperspectral images confirm the
effectiveness of the proposed representation for hyperspectral image
classification. Moreover, experiments with simulated multispectral data show
that the proposed model is capable of finding representations that may
effectively be used for classification of multispectral-resolution samples.

several control limitations and properties. For instance, for Schur stable and
symmetric networks: (i) if the number of control nodes is constant, then the
control energy increases exponentially with the number of network nodes, (ii)
if the number of control nodes is a fixed fraction of the network nodes, then
certain networks can be controlled with constant energy independently of the

strength. We validate our results with examples from power networks, social

First, when the particles can move in all the plane $\RR^2$, the model takes
the form of a system of massless Dirac equations coupled together by a
selfconsistent potential, which is the trace in the plane of the graphene of
the 3D Poisson potential associated to surface densities. In this case, we
prove local in time existence and uniqueness of a solution in $H^s(\RR^2)$, for

main tools that enable to reach $s\in (3/8,1/2)$ are the dispersive Strichartz
estimates that we generalized here for mixed quantum states. Second, we
consider a situation where the particles are constrained in a regular bounded

different model built on a modified Hamiltonian displaying the same energy band

fills this gap with two contributions. One, we suggest how to quantify
asymmetries in volatility spillovers due to bad and good volatility. Two, using
high frequency data covering most liquid U.S. stocks in seven sectors, we
provide ample evidence of the asymmetric connectedness of stocks. We
universally reject the hypothesis of symmetric connectedness at the

transmitted at different magnitudes in different sectors, and the asymmetries
sizably change over time. While negative spillovers are often of substantial
magnitudes, they do not strictly dominate positive spillovers. We find that the

Curie temperature of EuO are studied using first-principles calculations.
Linear response calculations in the virtual crystal approximation show a broad
maximum in the Curie temperature as a function of doping, which results from
the combination of the saturating contribution from indirect exchange and a
decreasing contribution from the f-d hopping mechanism. Non-Heisenberg
interaction at low doping levels and its effect on the Curie temperature are
examined. The electronic structure of a substitutional Gd and of an O vacancy
in EuO are evaluated. When the 4f spins are disordered, the impurity state goes
from single to double occupation, but correlated bound magnetic polarons are
not ruled out. At higher vacancy concentrations typical for Eu-rich EuO films,
the impurity states broaden into bands and remain partially filled. To go
beyond the homogeneous doping picture, magnetostructural cluster expansions are
constructed, which describe the modified exchange parameters near Gd dopants or
O vacancies. Thermodynamic properties are studied using Monte Carlo
simulations. The Curie temperature for Gd-doped EuO agrees with the results of
the virtual crystal approximation and shows a maximum of about 150 K. At 3.125%

played as background music for a given set of images. The proposed benchmark is
based on preference judgments, where relevance is considered a continuous
ordinal variable and judgments are collected for pairs of songs with respect to
a query (i.e., set of images). To capture a wide variety of songs and images,
we use a large space of possible music genres, different emotions expressed
through music, and various query-image themes. The benchmark consists of two
types of relevance assessments: (i) judgments obtained from a user study, that
serve as a ""gold standard"" for (ii) relevance judgments gathered through
Amazon's Mechanical Turk. We report on an analysis of relevance judgments based
on different levels of user agreement and investigate the performance of two
state-of-the-art soundtrack recommendation systems using the proposed
benchmark.

the U(1)_PQ can indeed survive as an accidental symmetry in the low-energy
effective theory, if the standard model gauge group is supplemented by a gauged
and discrete R symmetry, Z_N^R, forbidding all dangerous operators that
explicitly break the Peccei-Quinn symmetry. In contrast to similar approaches,
the requirement that the Z_N^R symmetry be anomaly-free forces us, in general,
to extend the supersymmetric standard model by new matter multiplets.

individually fulfill the current experimental constraints on the QCD vacuum
angle as well as on the axion decay constant. In particular, choosing the
number of additional multiplets appropriately, the order N of the Z_N^R

separated charges in the form of H3O+ and OH- ions. The charge separation
results from the self-dissociation of H2O molecules, and is accompanied by
recombination in order to maintain the equilibrium concentration, N. The charge
recombination is a diffusion-controlled process with characteristic lifetimes
of {\tau}_W and {\tau}_I, for water and ice respectively. The static
permittivity, {\epsilon}(0), is solely determined by N. Both, N and
{\epsilon}(0), are roughly constant at the water-ice phase transition, and both

lowered. The transformation of the broadband dielectric spectra at 0 {\deg}C

J1907.3-2050 is highly variable from hours to months-years at all wavelengths.
No coherent X-ray pulses are detected but rather transient features. The X-ray
spectrum reveals a multi-temperature optically thin plasma absorbed by complex
neutral material and a soft black body component arising from a small area.
These characteristics are remarkably similar to those observed in magnetic CVs.
A supra-solar abundance of nitrogen could arise from nuclear processed material

the second longest (20.82 h) binary period. IGRJ12123-5802 is variable in the

with little absorption.We derive a low accretion rate, consistent with a CV
below the orbital period gap. Its peculiar nIR/IR spectrum suggests a
contribution from cyclotron emission. It could either be a pre-polar or an IP
with the lowest degree of asynchronism.

rotational energy to the outflow by injecting Poynting flux, which will become
lepton-dominated so that a long-lasting reverse shock (RS) is developed. We
calculate the emission of the RS as well as the emission of forward shock (FS)
and find that in most cases the RS emission is stronger than FS emission. It is

destroys quantum resources. Quantum coherences seem to be a property that
vanishes at thermodynamic equilibrium. Away from equilibrium, quantum
coherences challenge the classical notions of a thermodynamic bath in a Carnot
engines, affect the efficiency of quantum transport, lead to violations of
Fourier's law, and can be used to dynamically control the temperature of a
state. However, the role of quantum coherence in thermodynamics is not fully
understood. Here we show that the relative entropy of a state with quantum
coherence with respect to its decohered state captures its deviation from
thermodynamic equilibrium. As a result, changes in quantum coherence can lead
to a heat flow with no associated temperature, and affect the entropy
production rate. From this, we derive a quantum version of the Onsager
reciprocal relations that shows that there is a reciprocal relation between
thermodynamic forces from coherence and quantum transport. Quantum decoherence
can be useful and offers new possibilities of thermodynamic control for quantum
transport.

the keyboard input from the user only via the $read(x)/scan(x)$ construct. Note
that the value of $x$ is unbounded in the sense that $x$ can have any value.
This construct is thus not useful for applications with bounded inputs. To
support bounded choices, we propose new bounded-choice statements for user
interation. Each input device (the keyboard, the mouse, the touch, $...$)
naturally requires a new bounded-choice statement. To make things simple,
however, we focus on a bounded-choice statement for keyboard -- kchoose -- to
allow for more controlled and more guided participation from the user. It is
straightforward to adjust our idea to other input devices. We illustrate our
idea via Java(BI), an extension of the core Java with a new bounded-choice

observations indicate that the central engines of bursts, after the gamma-ray
emission has ended, still have long periods of activity, during which energetic
explosions eject relativistic materials, leading to late-time X-ray emission.
It is thus expected that X-ray flares provide important clues to the nature of
the central engines of GRBs, and more importantly, unveil the physical
mechanism of the flares themselves, which has so far remained mysterious. Here
we report statistical results of X-ray flares of GRBs with known redshifts, and
show that X-ray flares and solar flares share three statistical properties:
power-law frequency distributions for energies, durations, and waiting times.
All of the distributions can be well understood within the physical framework
of a self-organized criticality (SOC) system. The statistical properties of
X-ray flares of GRBs are similar to solar flares, and thus can both be
attributed to a SOC process. Both types of flares may be driven by a magnetic
reconnection process, but X-ray flares of GRBs are produced in ultra-strongly
magnetized millisecond pulsars or long-term hyperaccreting disks around

For such classes of ETSs, we prove that any set ${\cal S}$ in the class is a

indicate that there is a nested sequence of ETSs that starts from the cycle and
grows, one variable node at a time, to generate ${\cal S}$. This

consistency is proved in a model for which Kullback-Leibler priors do not

calculate the mass variance to determine structure formation during preheating.
It is found that production of PBHs can be a generic result of the model, even
though the results seem to be sensitive to the values of the smoothing scale.
We consider a constraint for overproduction of PBHs that could uncover some
stress between inflation-preheating models and observations.

  with sparse data","40 pages",,,,"math.ST stat.ML stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Large-scale regression problems where both the number of variables, $p$, and
the number of observations, $n$, may be large and in the order of millions or
more, are becoming increasingly more common. Typically the data are sparse:
only a fraction of a percent of the entries in the design matrix are non-zero.
Nevertheless, often the only computationally feasible approach is to perform
dimension reduction to obtain a new design matrix with far fewer columns and
then work with this compressed data.
  $b$-bit min-wise hashing (Li and Konig, 2011) is a promising dimension
reduction scheme for sparse matrices which produces a set of random features
such that regression on the resulting design matrix approximates a kernel
regression with the resemblance kernel. In this work, we derive bounds on the
prediction error of such regressions. For both linear and logistic models we
show that the average prediction error vanishes asymptotically as long as $q
\|\beta^*\|_2^2 /n \rightarrow 0$, where $q$ is the average number of non-zero
entries in each row of the design matrix and $\beta^*$ is the coefficient of
the linear predictor.
  We also show that ordinary least squares or ridge regression applied to the
reduced data can in fact allow us fit more flexible models. We obtain
non-asymptotic prediction error bounds for interaction models and for models
where an unknown row normalisation must be applied in order for the signal to
be linear in the predictors.

  walls",,,,,"q-bio.SC math.NA q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Metabolic substrates, such as oxygen and glucose, are rapidly delivered to
the cell through filtration across microvessels walls. Modelling this important
process is complicated by the coupling between flow and transport equations,
which are linked through the osmotic pressure induced by the colloidal plasma
proteins. Microvessel wall is a composite media with the internal glycocalyx
layer exerting a remarkable sieving effect on macromolecules, with respect to
the external layer composed by endothelial cells. The physiological structure
of microvessel is represented as the superimposition of two membranes with
different properties; the inner membrane represents the glycocalyx, while the
outer membrane represents the surrounding endothelial cells. Application of
mass conservation principle and thermodynamic considerations lead to a model
composed by two coupled second-order partial differential equations in the
hydrostatic and osmotic pressures, one expressing volumetric mass conservation
and the other, which is non-linear, expressing macromolecules mass
conservation. Despite system complexity, the assumption that the properties of
the layers are piece-wise constant allows us to obtain analytical solutions for
the two pressures. This solution is in agreement with experimental
observations, which contrary to common belief, show that flow reversal cannot
occur in steady state unless luminal hydrostatic pressure drops below
physiologically plausible values. The observed variations of volumetric and
solute mass flux in case of a significant reduction of luminal hydrostatic
pressure are in qualitative agreement with observed variations during
experiments reported in the literature. On the other hand, homogenising
microvessel wall into a single-layer membrane with equivalent properties leads
to a different distribution of pressure across microvessel wall, not consistent
with observations.

intercalated atoms interact with both graphene sheet and MoS2 layer, increasing
the Li binding energies. However, the equilibrium geometries are ruled by the
MoS2 layer, where the intercalated Li atoms lie on the top (Li_T) and hollow
(Li_H) sites of the MoS2 layer. We calculate the Li diffusion barriers, along
the Li_T -> Li_H diffusion path, where we find similar energy barriers compared
with that obtained for Li adatoms on the MoS2 surface. Our results allow us to
infer that the Li storage capacity increases at MoS2/G interfaces, in
comparison with Li adatoms on the MoS2 surface, however, with no reduction on
the mobility of the intercalated Li atoms. Those properties are
interesting/useful to the development of Li batteries based on MoS2.

produce phylogenetic trees that grow ""vertically"" as time goes by. Pruning the
extinct lineages out of such trees leads to natural models for reconstructed

can be modelled by coalescent point processes (CPP), where trees grow
""horizontally"" by the sequential addition of vertical edges. Each new edge
starts at some random speciation time and ends at the present time; speciation
times are drawn from the same distribution independently. CPP lead to extremely
fast computation of tree likelihoods and simulation of reconstructed trees.
Their topology always follows the uniform distribution on ranked tree shapes
(URT). We characterize which forward-time models lead to URT reconstructed
trees and among these, which lead to CPP reconstructed trees. We show that for
any ""asymmetric"" diversification model in which speciation rates only depend on
time and extinction rates only depend on time and on a non-heritable trait
(e.g., age), the reconstructed tree is CPP, even if extant species are
incompletely sampled. If rates additionally depend on the number of species,
the reconstructed tree is (only) URT (but not CPP). We characterize the common
distribution of speciation times in the CPP description, and discuss incomplete
species sampling as well as three special model cases in detail: 1) extinction
rate does not depend on a trait; 2) rates do not depend on time; 3) mass
extinctions may happen additionally at certain points in the past.

After extended electron scrubbing at kinetic energy of 10 and 500 eV, the dmax
value drops to the ultimate values of 1.35 and 1.1, respectively. In both cases
the surface oxidized phases are significantly reduced, whereas only in the
sample scrubbed at 500 eV the formation of a graphitic-like C layer is
observed. We find that the electron scrubbing of technical Cu surfaces can be
described as occurring in two steps, where the first step consists in the
electron induced desorption of weakly bound contaminants that occurs
indifferently at 10 and at 500 eV and corresponds to a partial decrease of
dmax, and the second step, activated by more energetic electrons and becoming
evident at high doses, which increases the number of graphitic-like C-C bonds
via the dissociation of adsorbates already contaminating the ""as received""
surface or accumulating on this surface during irradiation. Our results
demonstrate how the kinetic energy of impinging electrons is a crucial

the possible presence of gap anisotropies cannot be completely excluded. The
amplitudes of the two gaps \Delta_{S} and \Delta_{L} show similar monotonic

not only in science and technology, but in every day life. The underlying basic
optical principles have been developed within the last five centuries using
visible light available from the sun or other laboratory light sources. X-rays
were detected in 1895, and the full potential of soft- and hard-x ray radiation
as a probe for the electronic and geometric properties of matter, for material
analysis and its characterisation is available only since the advent of
synchrotron radiation sources some 50 years ago. On the other hand
high-brilliance and high power synchrotron radiation of present-days 3rd and
4th generation light sources is not always beneficial. Highenergy machines and
accelerator-based light sources can suffer from a serious performance drop or
limitations due to interaction of the synchrotron radiation with the
accelerator walls, thus producing clouds of photoelectrons (e-cloud) which in
turn interact with the accelerated beam. Thus the suitable choice of
accelerator materials and their surface coating, which determines the x-ray
optical behaviour is of utmost importance to achieve ultimate emittance. Basic

  Dwarfs","17 pages, 13 figures",,"10.1093/mnras/stt1477",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Measurement of the substellar initial mass function (IMF) in very young
clusters is hampered by the possibility of the age spread of cluster members.
This is particularly serious for candidate planetary mass objects (PMOs), which
have a very similar location to older and more massive brown dwarfs on the
Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram (HRD). This degeneracy can be lifted by the
measurement of gravity-sensitive spectral features. To this end we have
obtained medium resolution (R~5000) Near-infrared Integral Field Spectrometer
(NIFS) K band spectra of a sample of late M- / early L-type dwarfs. The sample
comprises old field dwarfs and very young brown dwarfs in the Taurus
association and in the Sigma Orionis cluster. We demonstrate a positive
correlation between the strengths of the 2.21micron NaI doublet and the
objects' ages. We demonstrate a further correlation between these objects' ages
and the shape of their K band spectra. We have quantified this correlation in
the form of a new index, the H2(K) index. This index appears to be more
gravity-sensitive than the NaI doublet and has the advantage that it can be
computed for spectra where gravity-sensitive spectral lines are unresolved,
while it is also more sensitive to surface gravity at very young ages (<10 Myr)
than the triangular H band peak. Both correlations differentiate young objects
from field dwarfs, while the H2(K) index can distinguish, at least
statistically, populations of ~1 Myr objects from populations of ~10 Myr
objects. We applied the H2(K) index to NIFS data for one Orion nebula cluster
(ONC) PMO and to previously published low resolution spectra for several other
ONC PMOs where the 2.21micron NaI doublet was unresolved and concluded that the
average age of the PMOs is ~1 Myr.

double-discrete linear and nonlinear propagation of light beams, in which not
only the transverse coordinate (the fiber's number) is discrete, but also the
longitudinal (propagation) coordinate, i.e., the number of the fiber-crossing
site, is effectively discrete too. In the linear limit, this transmission
regime features double-discrete self-collimation. The nonlinear fishnet arrays
with both focusing and defocusing nonlinearities give rise to double-discrete
spatial solitons. Solitons bifurcating from two different branches of the
linear dispersion relation feature strong interactions and form composite
states. In the continuum limit, the model of the nonlinear fishnet reduces to a
system of coupled-mode equations similar to those describing Bragg gratings,
but without the cross-phase-modulation terms.

interactions and population imbalance. In both linear response theories, we
find that the fluctuations of the order parameter must be treated on equal
footing with the gauge transformations associated with the symmetries of the
Hamiltonian so that important constraints including various sum rules can be
satisfied. Both theories can be applied to the whole BCS-Bose-Einstein
condensation crossover. The spin linear responses are qualitatively different
with and without population imbalance because collective-mode effects from the
fluctuations of the order parameter survive in the presence of population
imbalance, even though the associated symmetry is not broken by the order
parameter. Since a polarized superfluid becomes unstable at low temperatures in
the weak and intermediate coupling regimes, we found that the density and spin
susceptibilities diverge as the system approaches the unstable regime, but the
emergence of phase separation preempts the divergence.

sputtering onto the inner walls of the accelerator seems to be the most
promising solution for suppressing the electron cloud problem. However, these
coatings change their electron emission properties during long term exposure to
air. The ageing process of carbon coated samples with initial SEY of about 0.9
received from CERN is studied as a function of exposure to different
environments. It is shown that samples having the same initial SEY may age with
different rates. The SEY increase can be correlated with the surface
concentration of oxygen. Annealing of samples in air at 100-200 {\deg}C reduces
the ageing rate and even recovers previously degraded samples. The result of
annealing is reduction of the hydrogen content in the coatings by triggering
its surface segregation followed by desorption.

$N$-body simulation and idealized $N$-body plus hydrodynamics simulations of a
group-cluster merger. We find that group environments can contribute
significantly to galaxy pre-processing by means of enhanced galaxy-galaxy
merger rates, removal of galaxies' hot halo gas by ram pressure stripping, and
tidal truncation of their galaxies. Tidal distortion of the group during infall
does not contribute to pre-processing. Post-processing is also shown to be
effective: galaxy-galaxy collisions are enhanced during a group's pericentric
passage within a cluster, the merger shock enhances the ram pressure on group
and cluster galaxies, and an increase in local density during the merger leads
to greater galactic tidal truncation.

numerical solution of linearized infinite-dimensional statistical inverse
problems. We adopt the Bayesian inference formulation: given observational data
and their uncertainty, the governing forward problem and its uncertainty, and a
prior probability distribution describing uncertainty in the parameter field,
find the posterior probability distribution over the parameter field. The prior
must be chosen appropriately in order to guarantee well-posedness of the
infinite-dimensional inverse problem and facilitate computation of the
posterior. Furthermore, straightforward discretizations may not lead to
convergent approximations of the infinite-dimensional problem. And finally,
solution of the discretized inverse problem via explicit construction of the
covariance matrix is prohibitive due to the need to solve the forward problem
as many times as there are parameters. Our computational framework builds on
the infinite-dimensional formulation proposed by Stuart (A. M. Stuart, Inverse
problems: A Bayesian perspective, Acta Numerica, 19 (2010), pp. 451-559), and
incorporates a number of components aimed at ensuring a convergent
discretization of the underlying infinite-dimensional inverse problem. The
framework additionally incorporates algorithms for manipulating the prior,
constructing a low rank approximation of the data-informed component of the
posterior covariance operator, and exploring the posterior that together ensure
scalability of the entire framework to very high parameter dimensions. We
demonstrate this computational framework on the Bayesian solution of an inverse
problem in 3D global seismic wave propagation with hundreds of thousands of
parameters.

for competition between multiple escapes by explicitly modeling the
accumulation of escape mutations and the stochastic effects of rare multiple

transform (NHT). The transformations preserve the circulant nature of the
discrete Hilbert transform (DHT) matrix together with alternating values in
each row being zero and non-zero. Specific examples for 4-point, 6-point, and
8-point NHT are provided. The NHT transformation can be used as a primitive to
create cryptographically useful scrambling transformations.

and 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance techniques, and unexpectedly discovered that
a new antiferromagnetic (AF) phase follows the double SC domes on further H
doping, forming a symmetric alignment of AF and SC phases in the electronic
phase diagram. We demonstrated that the new AF ordering originates from the
nesting between electron pockets, unlike the nesting between electron and hole
pockets as seen in the majority of undoped pnictides. The new AF ordering is
derived from the features common to high-Tc pnictides: however, it has not been
reported so far for other high-Tc pnictides because of their poor electron
doping capability.

operations to $O(N^{1/6+\varepsilon})$ arithmetic operations, is presented in
this note. Equivalently, given the least $(\log N)/6$ bits of a factor of the
balanced integer $N = pq$, where $p$ and $q$ are primes, the algorithm factors
the integer in polynomial time $O(\log(N)^c)$, with $c \geq 0$ constant, and
$\varepsilon > 0$ an arbitrarily small number. It improves the current
deterministic factorization algorithm, rated at arithmetic operations to
$O(N^{1/5+\varepsilon})$ arithmetic operations.

We consider the classical capacity of quantum channels that are image-additive,

non-asymptotic fundamental limit admits a second-order approximation that

wavelength behavior of collective particle displacements in

results are represented by the behavior of the hydrodynamic function H(q) that
relates the effective collective diffusion coefficient, D_e(q) with the static
structure factor S(q) and the self-diffusion coefficient of isolated particles
D_0: H(q)=D_e(q)S(q)/D_0. We find an apparent divergence of H(q) as q->0 with
the form H(q) proportional to q^-gamma, 1.7<gamma<1.9, for both q1D and q2D
colloid suspensions. Given that S(q) does not diverge as q=>0 we infer that
D_e(q) does. We provide evidence that this divergence arises from the interplay
of boundary conditions on the flow of the carrier liquid and many-body
hydrodynamic interactions between colloid particles that affect the long
wavelength behavior of the particle collective diffusion coefficient in the
suspension. We speculate that in the q1D and q2D systems studied the divergence
of H(q) might be associated with a q-dependent partial slip boundary condition,
specifically an effective slip length that increases with decreasing q. We also
verify, using data from the work of Lin, Rice and Weitz (J. Chem. Phys. 99,
9585 (1993)), the prediction by Bleibel et al (arXiv:1305.3715), that D_e(q)
for a monolayer of colloid particles constrained to lie in the interface
between two fluids diverges as 1/q as q->0. The verification of that
prediction, which is based on an analysis that allows two-dimensional colloid
motion embedded in three-dimensional suspending fluid motion, supports the
contention that the boundary conditions that define a q2D system play a very
important role in determining the long wavelength behavior of the collective
diffusion coefficient.

several star+planet systems, encompassing 10h of the most favourable orbital

operate in a much higher signal-to-noise ratio domain than when compared with

pessimistic approach to the noise level estimation, where systematics in the

radiation from dust grains that are heated by the central engine in the
UV/optical and are almost at the sublimation temperature. A brightening of the
central source can thus further sublimate the innermost dust, leading to an
increase in the radius of the near-IR emitting region. Such changes in radius
have been indirectly probed by the measurements of the changes in the time lag
between the near-IR and UV/optical light variation. Here we report direct
evidence for such a receding sublimation region through the near-IR
interferometry of the brightest Type 1 AGN in NGC4151. The increase in radius
follows a significant brightening of the central engine with a delay of at
least a few years, which is thus the implied destruction timescale of the
innermost dust distribution. Compiling historic flux variations and radius
measurements, we also infer the reformation timescale for the inner dust
distribution to be several years in this galactic nucleus. More specifically
and quantitatively, we find that the radius at a given time seems to be
correlated with a long-term average of the flux over the previous several (~6)
years, instead of the instantaneous flux. Finally, we also report measurements

the solution as a composite function: the model outputs are functions of the

symmetries are explored in detail. With a precisely measured value of the
reactor angle, these two residual symmetries predict distinct distributions for
the Dirac CP phase and the atmospheric angle, which leads to the possibility of
identifying them at neutrino experiments. For both symmetries, it is possible
to resolve the neutrino mass hierarchy in most of the parameter space, and they
can be distinguished from one another if the true residual symmetry is Z^s_2
and the atmospheric angle is non-maximal. These results are obtained using an
equally split schedule: a 1.5-year run of neutrinos and a 1.5-year run of
antineutrinos at NOvA together with a 2.5-year run of neutrinos and a 2.5-year
run of antineutrinos at T2K. This schedule can significantly increase and
stabilize the sensitivities to the mass hierarchy and the octant of the
atmospheric angle with only a moderate compromise to the sensitivity of
distinguishing Z^s_2 and Zbar^s_2.

tractable by retaining the metric perturbations to first order, the first

into account the most important nonlinear effects of Einstein gravity. It is
also expected that any significant ""backreaction"" should appear at this order.
We show that the simulation scheme is feasible in practice by implementing it
for a plane-symmetric situation and running two test cases, one with only cold
dark matter, and one which also includes a cosmological constant. For these
plane-symmetric situations, the deviations from the usual Newtonian N-body
simulations remain small and, apart from a non-trivial correction to the
background, can be accurately estimated within the Newtonian framework. The
correction to the background scale factor, which is a genuine ""backreaction""
effect, can be robustly obtained with our algorithm. Our numerical approach is
also naturally suited for the inclusion of extra relativistic fields and thus
for dark energy or modified gravity simulations.

is to reduce binding energy and bond lengths and increase activation energy
barriers when bond breaking is involved. The accuracy of the corrected
functionals varies strongly, the correction to the binding energy being too
weak for the local density approximation but too strong for the gradient
dependent functionals considered. For the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE)
functional, a scaling of the PZ-SIC by one half gives improved results on
average for both binding energy and bond lengths. The PZ-SIC does not
necessarily give more accurate total energy, but it can result in a better
cancellation of errors. An essential aspect of these calculations is the use of
complex orbitals. A restriction to real orbitals leads to less accurate results
as was recently shown for atoms [S. Kl\""upfel, P. Kl\""upfel, and H. J\'onsson,

gauge structure suggests the existence of a particle - the graviton - that
mediates the gravitational force. At the mesoscopic scale, solid-state systems
are subjected to gauge fields of different nature: materials can be immersed in
external electromagnetic fields, but they can also feature emerging gauge
fields in their low-energy description. In this review, we focus on another

effective gauge potentials in their description. Neutral atoms ""feeling""

electron gas subjected to a magnetic field, but also, the interaction of
elementary particles with non-Abelian gauge fields. Here, we review different

agent-based model as well as the mathematics of multi-type branching-processes
to illustrate how the SS epidemic differs from the more familiar uniform
epidemic (e.g., caused by influenza). The conclusions may surprise the reader:
(a) The SS epidemic must be described by at least two numbers, such as the mean
reproductive number (of ""secondary"" cases caused by a ""primary case""), R0, and
the variance of same, call it V0; (b) Even if R0 > 1, if V0 >> R0 the
probability that an infection-chain caused by one primary case goes extinct
without intervention may be close to one (e.g., 0.97); (c) The SS epidemic may
have a long ""kindling period"" in which sporadic cases appear (transmitted from
some unknown host) and generate a cluster of cases, but the chains peter out,
perhaps generating a false sense of security that a pandemic will not occur;
(d) Interventions such as isolation (or contact-tracing and secondary case
isolation) may prove efficacious even without driving R0 below one; (e) The
efficacy of such interventions diminishes, but slowly, with increasing V0 at
fixed R0. From these considerations, I argue that the SS epidemic has dynamics
sufficiently distinct from the uniform case that efficacious public-health
interventions can be designed even in the absence of a vaccine or other form of
treatment.

flavor reveals a remarkable property: For all flavors, it is approximately
linear in mass squared, $m_n^2\approx a(n+b)$, $n$ is the radial quantum
number. We draw attention to the fact that such a universal behavior for any
quark mass cannot be obtained in a natural way within the usual
semirelativistic potential and string-like models - if the Regge-like behavior
is reproduced for the mesons made of the light quarks, the trajectories become
essentially nonlinear for the heavy-quark sector. In reality, however, the
linearity for the heavy mesons appears to be even better than for the light
ones. In addition, the slope a is quite different for different quark flavors.
This difference is difficult to understand within the QCD string approach since
the slope measures the interaction strength among quarks. We propose a simple
way for reparametrization of the vector spectrum in terms of quark masses and
universal slope and intercept. Our model-independent analysis suggests that the
quarks of any mass should be regarded as static sources inside mesons while the

The crystal growth velocity is maximized when the efficiency of converting

unrealistic to provide bases for predictive theories. As illustrations of what
I mean, the first part of this article is devoted to brief summaries of
imaginative, sensible, but disparate and often contradictory ideas for solving
glass problems. Almost all of these ideas remain alive today, with their own
enthusiastic advocates. I then describe numerical simulations, mostly by H.
Tanaka and coworkers, in which it appears that very simple, polydisperse
systems of hard disks and spheres develop long range, Ising-like,
bond-orientational order as they approach glass transitions. Finally, I
summarize my recent proposal that topologically ordered clusters of particles,
in disordered environments, tend to become aligned with each other as if they
were two-state systems, and thus produce the observed Ising-like behavior.
Neither Tanaka's results nor my proposed interpretation of them fit comfortably
within any of the currently popular glass theories.

of B lymphocytes of the same idiotype which is encoded by a bit string. The
links of the network connect nodes with (nearly) complementary strings. The
population of a node survives if the number of occupied neighbours is not too
small and not too large. There is an influx of lymphocytes with random idiotype
from the bone marrow. Previous investigations have shown that this system
evolves toward highly organized architectures, where the nodes can be
classified into groups according to their statistical properties. The building
principles of these architectures can be analytically described and the
statistical results of simulations agree very well with results of a modular
mean field theory. In this paper we present simulation results for the case
that one or several nodes, playing the role of self, are permanently occupied.
We observe that the group structure of the architecture is very similar to the
case without self antigen, but organized such that the neighbours of the self
are only weakly occupied, thus providing self tolerance. We also treat this
situation in mean field theory which give results in good agreement with data
from simulation.

decoding multiple integer linear combinations from the output of a Gaussian
multiple-input multiple-output channel. This work applies the IF approach to
arrive at a new low-complexity scheme, IF source coding, for distributed lossy
compression of correlated Gaussian sources under a minimum mean squared error
distortion measure. All encoders use the same nested lattice codebook. Each
encoder quantizes its observation using the fine lattice as a quantizer and
reduces the result modulo the coarse lattice, which plays the role of binning.
Rather than directly recovering the individual quantized signals, the decoder
first recovers a full-rank set of judiciously chosen integer linear
combinations of the quantized signals, and then inverts it. In general, the
linear combinations have smaller average powers than the original signals. This
allows to increase the density of the coarse lattice, which in turn translates
to smaller compression rates. We also propose and analyze a one-shot version of
IF source coding, that is simple enough to potentially lead to a new design
principle for analog-to-digital converters that can exploit spatial
correlations between the sampled signals.

deep into the medium due to the diffusion process induced by multiple
scattering. This poses a fundamental limitation to optically imaging, sensing,
and manipulating targets embedded in opaque scattering layers such as
biological tissues. One strategy for mitigating the shallow wave penetration is
to exploit eigenmodes with anomalously high transmittance existing in any
disordered medium. When waves are coupled to these eigenmodes, strong
constructive wave interference enhances deeply penetrating waves. However,
finding such eigenmodes has been a challenging task due to the complexity of
disordered media. In this Letter, we present an iterative wavefront control
method that selectively enriches the coupling of incident beam to
high-transmission eigenmodes. Specifically, we refined the high-transmission
eigenmodes from an arbitrary initial wave by either maximizing transmitted wave
intensity or minimizing reflected wave intensity. Using the proposed method, we
achieved more than a factor of 3 increases in light transmission through a
scattering medium exhibiting hundreds of scattering events. Our approach is
readily applicable to in vivo applications in which only the detection of
reflected waves is available. Enhancing light penetration will lead to
improving the working depth of optical imaging and treatment techniques.

of cluster structure and may provide complementary cosmological constraints.
Despite recent progresses, discrepancies still remain among modelling and
observations of arc abundance, specially regarding the redshift distribution of
strong lensing clusters. Besides, fast ""semi-analytic"" methods still have to
incorporate the success obtained with simulations. In this paper we discuss the
contribution of the magnification in gravitational arc statistics. Although
lensing conserves surface brightness, the magnification increases the
signal-to-noise ratio of the arcs, enhancing their detectability. We present an
approach to include this and other observational effects in semi-analytic
calculations for arc statistics. The cross section for arc formation ({\sigma})
is computed through a semi-analytic method based on the ratio of the
eigenvalues of the magnification tensor. Using this approach we obtained the
scaling of {\sigma} with respect to the magnification, and other parameters,
allowing for a fast computation of the cross section. We apply this method to
evaluate the expected number of arcs per cluster using an elliptical
Navarro--Frenk--White matter distribution. Our results show that the
magnification has a strong effect on the arc abundance, enhancing the fraction
of arcs, moving the peak of the arc fraction to higher redshifts, and softening
its decrease at high redshifts. We argue that the effect of magnification
should be included in arc statistics modelling and that it could help to
reconcile arcs statistics predictions with the observational data.

high-redshift galaxies, the hydrogen recombination line Lyman-alpha (Lya) is of
particular interest as it gives access to the measurement of cosmological
quantities such as the star formation rate of distant galaxy populations.
However, the interpretation of this line and the calibration of such
observables is still subject to serious uncertainties. Therefore, it important
to understand under what conditions the Lya line can be used as a reliable star
formation diagnostic tool. We use a sample of 24 Lya emitters at z ~ 0.3 with
an optical spectroscopic follow-up to calculate the Lya escape fraction and its
dependency upon different physical properties. We also examine the reliability
of Lya as a star formation rate indicator. We combine these observations with a
compilation of Lya emitters selected at z = 0 - 0.3 to assemble a larger
sample. The Lya escape fraction depends clearly on the dust extinction
following the relation fesc(Lya) = C(Lya) x 10^(-0.4 E(B-V) k(Lya)), but with a
shallower slope than previously reported, with k(Lya) ~ 6.67 and C(Lya) = 0.22.
However, the correlation does not follow the expected curve for a simple dust
attenuation. We explore the various mechanisms than lead to fesc(Lya) values
above the continuum extinction curve, i.e. to an enhancement of the Lya output.
We also observe that the strength of Lya and the escape fraction appear
unrelated to the galaxy metallicity. Regarding the reliability of Lya as a star
formation rate (SFR) indicator, we show that the deviation of SFR(Lya) from the
true SFR (as traced by the UV continuum) is a function of the observed SFR(UV),
which can be seen as the decrease of fesc(Lya) with increasing UV luminosity.
Moreover, we observe a redshift-dependence of this relationship revealing the
underlying evolution of fesc(Lya) with redshift.

Lya and UV light profiles and show they are well-fitted by S\'ersic profiles,
but Lya profiles show indices systematically lower than those of the UV (n
approx 1-2 instead of >~4). This reveals a general lack of the central
concentration in Lya that is ubiquitous in the UV. Photometric growth curves
increase more slowly for Lya than the FUV, showing that small apertures may
underestimate the EW. For most galaxies, however, flux and EW curves flatten by
radii ~10 kpc, suggesting that if placed at high-z, only a few of our galaxies
would suffer from large flux losses. We compute global properties of the sample
in large apertures, and show total luminosities to be independent of all other
quantities. Normalized Lya throughput, however, shows significant correlations:
escape is found to be higher in galaxies of lower star formation rate, dust
content, mass, and several quantities that suggest harder ionizing continuum
and lower metallicity. Eight galaxies could be selected as high-z Lya emitters,
based upon their luminosity and EW. We discuss the results in the context of
high-z Lya and UV samples. A few galaxies have EWs above 50 AA, and one shows

existing broadband photometry, these measurements rule out cloud-free
atmospheres in chemical equilibrium assuming either solar abundances (5.4 sigma
confidence) or a moderate level of metal enrichment (50x solar abundances, 3.8
sigma), confirming previous results that such models are not representative for
cool, low-mass, externally irradiated extrasolar planets. Current measurements
are consistent with a flat transmission spectrum, which suggests that the
atmosphere is explained by high-altitude clouds and haze, disequilibrium
chemistry, unexpected abundance patterns, or the atmosphere is extremely
metal-rich (>200x solar). Because GJ 3470b's low bulk density sets an upper
limit on the planet's atmospheric enrichment of <300x solar, the atmospheric
mean molecular weight must be <9. Thus, if the atmosphere is cloud-free its
spectral features should be detectable with future observations. Transit

ATLAS3D data. It is also identical to the average fraction found recently in
Abell 1689 by D'Eugenio et al.. Thus it appears that the average slow rotator
fraction of early type galaxies remains remarkably constant across many
different environments, spanning five orders of magnitude in galaxy number
density. However, within each cluster the slow rotators are generally found in
regions of higher projected density, possibly as a result of mass segregation
by dynamical friction. These results provide firm constraints on the mechanisms
that produce early-type galaxies: they must maintain a fixed ratio between the
number of fast rotators and slow rotators while also allowing the total
early-type fraction to increase in clusters relative to the field. A complete
survey of Coma, sampling hundreds rather than tens of galaxies, could probe a
more representative volume of Coma and provide significantly stronger
constraints, particularly on how the slow rotator fraction varies at larger
radii.

of [Fe/H] ~ -1.50 in the new UVES scale. We also identify the cluster's blue
straggler population. Comparing the radial distribution of these stars with the
red giant branch population, we find that the blue stragglers are more
centrally concentrated, as found in previous studies of blue stragglers in
globular clusters. Taking advantage of the large field of view covered by our
study, we analyzed the surface density profile of the cluster, finding
extratidal main sequence stars out to r ~ 14.1 arcmin or about twice the tidal
radius. We speculate that this may be due to tidal disruption in the course of
M72's orbit, in which case tidal tails associated with the cluster may exist.
We also take a fresh look at the variable stars in the cluster, recovering all
previous known variables, including three SX Phoenicis stars, and adding three
previously unknown RR Lyrae (1 c-type and 2 ab-type) to the total census.

unprecedented depth at this wavelength. By integrating the number counts above
this flux limit, we measure 113.9^{+49.7}_{-28.4} Jydeg^{-2} of the 450um
extragalactic background light (EBL). The majority of this contribution is from
sources with S_450um between 1-10mJy, and these sources are likely to be the

measure their masses accurately and with high precision. Hydrostatic mass is
one of the most common methods for estimating the masses of individual galaxy
clusters, which suffer from biases due to departures from hydrostatic
equilibrium. Using a large, mass-limited sample of massive galaxy clusters from
a high-resolution hydrodynamical cosmological simulation, in this work we show
that in addition to turbulent and bulk gas velocities, acceleration of gas
introduces biases in the hydrostatic mass estimate of galaxy clusters. In
unrelaxed clusters, the acceleration bias is comparable to the bias due to
non-thermal pressure associated with merger-induced turbulent and bulk gas
motions. In relaxed clusters, the mean mass bias due to acceleration is small
(<3%), but the scatter in the mass bias can be reduced by accounting for gas
acceleration. Additionally, this acceleration bias is greater in the outskirts
of higher redshift clusters where mergers are more frequent and clusters are
accreting more rapidly. Since gas acceleration cannot be observed directly, it
introduces an irreducible bias for hydrostatic mass estimates. This
acceleration bias places limits on how well we can recover cluster masses from
future X-ray and microwave observations. We discuss implications for cluster
mass estimates based on X-ray, Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, and gravitational
lensing observations and their impact on cluster cosmology.

Several models have been proposed to explain the existence of multiple stellar
populations in GCs, but no single model provides a fully satisfactory match to
existing data. Correlations between chemistry and global parameters such as
cluster mass or luminosity are fundamental clues to the physics of GC
formation. In this Letter, we present an analysis of the mean abundances of Fe,
Mg, C, N, and Ca for 72 old GCs from the Andromeda galaxy. We show for the
first time that there is a correlation between the masses of GCs and the mean
stellar abundances of nitrogen, spanning almost two decades in mass. This
result sheds new light on the formation of GCs, providing important constraints
on their internal chemical evolution and mass loss history.

rate of 15-50 p/s and a luminosity of up to 10^32 cm-2 s-1. The process is the
direct production of a H_0 scalar in the s-state. Its partial widths can be
studied in clean conditions and with remarkable accuracy. The Ho mass itself
can be measured to about +-100 keV (deltaE/E <10^-6) in the (WW) channel with
the help of the decay frequency of the polarized mu->e nu nu decay electrons.
  The realization of a cascade of unconventional but very small rings of few
meters radius is described, in order to achieve the required longitudinal and
transverse emittances. Physics requirements and the many studies already
undertaken suggest that the next step, prior to but adequate for a H_0 physics
programme, could be the practical realization of a full scale muon cooling
demonstrator. The correct operation of the demonstrator may be initially
explored with the help of very low intensity muon beam already available in a
number of different accelerators.
  The additional but relatively conventional components necessary to realize
the facility with the appropriate luminosity should be constructed only after
the success of this initial cooling experiment has been conclusively
demonstrated. The ultimate mu+mu- collider for a Higgs Factory can be situated

1) it can be a dominant component in the observed rate of change of the surface
elevation, and 2) storage of liquid water in the lower density firn layer is
now considered a critical component in the mass balance of ice sheets. If the
rate of change of surface elevation can be equated with the rate of change in
the mass of the ice sheet, we would have an excellent means of monitoring ice
sheet mass balance. However, knowledge of firn densification rates is needed to
make the inference of mass rate of change from volume rate of change. Several

observations of 559 stars in 20 globular and open clusters. The cluster
observations were supplemented by observations of stars in NASA's Kepler field

discuss the accuracy and precision of the derived stellar parameters,

we also briefly discuss the derived results for the abundances of the

reasonably accurate results for temperature and metallicity, but suffers from
systematic errors in surface gravity. We derive calibration relations that
bring the raw ASPCAP results into better agreement with independently
determined stellar parameters. The internal scatter of ASPCAP parameters within
clusters suggests that, metallicities are measured with a precision better than

gene expression and protein level dynamics. The protein amount is regarded as a
diffusion process and is described by a backward stochastic differential
equation (BSDE). Unlike many other SDE techniques proposed in the literature,
the BSDE method is backward in time; that is, instead of initial conditions it
requires the specification of endpoint (""final"") conditions, in addition to the
model parametrization. To validate our approach we employ Gillespie's
stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) to generate (forward) benchmark data,
according to predefined gene network models. Numerical simulations show that
the BSDE method is able to correctly infer the protein level distributions that
preceded a known final condition, obtained originally from the forward SSA.
This makes the BSDE method a powerful systems biology tool for time reversed
simulations, allowing, for example, the assessment of the biological conditions

potential to model a wide range of domains. For this reason, graph problems
have been of interest since the early days of computer science. Some of these
problems consider substructures of a graph that have certain properties. These
substructures of interest, generally called patterns, are often meaningful in
the domain being modeled. Classic examples of patterns include spanning trees,
cycles and subgraphs.
  This thesis focuses on the topic of explicitly listing all the patterns
existing in an input graph. One of the defining features of this problem is
that the number of patterns is frequently exponential on the size of the input
graph. Thus, the time complexity of listing algorithms is parameterized by the
size of the output.
  The main contribution of this work is the presentation of optimal algorithms
for four different problems of listing patterns in graphs, namely the listing
of k-subtrees, k-subgraphs, st-paths and cycles. The algorithms presented are
framed within the same generic approach, based in a recursive partition of the
search space that divides the problem into subproblems. The key to an efficient
implementation of this approach is to avoid recursing into subproblems that do
not list any patterns. With this goal in sight, a dynamic data structure,
called the certificate, is introduced and maintained throughout the recursion.
Moreover, properties of the recursion tree and lower bounds on the number of
patterns are used to amortize the cost of the algorithm on the size of the
output.

by a high density stellar cluster, whose mass is mostly in hard-to-detect faint
stars and compact remnants. Such dark cusps dominate the dynamics near the MBH:
a dark cusp in the Galactic center (GC) of the Milky Way would strongly affect
orbital tests of General Relativity there; on cosmic scales, dark cusps set the
rates of gravitational wave emission events from compact remnants that spiral
into MBHs, and they modify the rates of tidal disruption events, to list only
some implications. A recently discovered long-period massive young binary (P_12
<~ 1 yr, M_12 ~ O(100 M_sun), T_12 ~ 6x10^6 yr), only ~0.1 pc from the Galactic
MBH (Pfuhl et al 2013), sets a lower bound on the 2-body relaxation timescale
there, min t_rlx ~ (P_12/M_12)^(2/3)T_12 ~ 10^7 yr, and correspondingly, an
upper bound on the stellar number density, max n ~ few x 10^8/<M_star^2>
1/pc^3, based on the binary's survival against evaporation by the dark cusp.
However, a conservative dynamical estimate, the drain limit, implies t_rlx >
O(10^8) yr. Such massive binaries are thus too short-lived and tightly bound to
constrain a dense relaxed dark cusp. We explore here in detail the use of
longer-period, less massive and longer-lived binaries (P_12 ~ few yr, M_12 ~
2-4 M_sun, T_12 ~ 10^8-10^10 yr), presently just below the detection threshold,

subject of intense interest. Recently, a series of graph evolution processes
have been introduced that lead to discontinuous percolation transitions where
the addition of a single edge causes the size of the largest component to
exhibit a significant macroscopic jump in the thermodynamic limit. These
processes can have additional exotic behaviors, such as displaying a `Devil's
staircase' of discrete jumps in the supercritical regime. Here we investigate
whether the location of the largest jump coincides with the percolation
threshold for a range of processes, such as Erdos-Renyi percolation,
percolation via edge competition and via growth by overtaking. We find that the
largest jump asymptotically occurs at the percolation transition for
Erdos-Renyi and other processes exhibiting global continuity, including models
exhibiting an `explosive' transition. However, for percolation processes
exhibiting genuine discontinuities, the behavior is substantially richer. In
percolation models where the order parameter exhibits a staircase, the largest
discontinuity generically does not coincide with the percolation transition.
For the generalized Bohman-Frieze-Wormald model, it depends on the model
parameter. Distinct parameter regimes well in the supercritical regime feature
unstable discontinuous transitions, which is a novel and unexpected phenomenon
in percolation. We thus demonstrate that seemingly and genuinely discontinuous
percolation transitions can involve a rich behavior in supercriticality, a

consensus', in networks of agents. We consider the task of using sensor
networks to perform distributed measurement of a parameter which has both
spatial (in this paper 1D) and temporal variations. Our idea is to maintain
potentially useful local information regarding spatial variation, as contrasted
with reaching a single, global consensus, as well as to mitigate the effect of
measurement errors. We employ two schemes for computation of local average
consensus: exponential weighting and uniform finite window. In both schemes, we
design local average consensus algorithms to address first the case where the
measured parameter has spatial variation but is constant in time, and then the
case where the measured parameter has both spatial and temporal variations. Our
designed algorithms are distributed, in that information is exchanged only
among neighbors. Moreover, we analyze both spatial and temporal frequency
responses and noise propagation associated with the algorithms. The tradeoffs
of using local consensus, as compared to standard global consensus, include
higher memory requirement and degraded noise performance. Arbitrary updating
weights and random spacing between sensors are analyzed in the proposed
algorithms.

implementing phenomenological models for magnetic field amplification,

nonlinear DSA. For typical SNR parameters the CR protons can be accelerated to
PeV energies only if the region of amplified field ahead of the shock is
extensive enough to contain the diffusion lengths of the particles of interest.
Even with the help of Alfv'enic drift, it remains somewhat challenging to
construct a nonlinear DSA model for SNRs in which order of 10 % of the
supernova explosion energy is converted to the CR energy and the magnetic field
is amplified by a factor of 10 or so in the shock precursor, while, at the same
time, the energy spectrum of PeV protons is steeper than E^{-2}. To explore the
influence of these physical effects on observed SNR emissions, we also compute
resulting radio-to-gamma-ray spectra. Nonthermal emission spectra, especially
in X-ray and gamma-ray bands,depend on the time dependent evolution of CR
injection process, magnetic field amplification, and particle escape, as well
as the shock dynamic evolution. This result comes from the fact that the high
energy end of the CR spectrum is composed of the particles that are injected in
the very early stages of blast wave evolution. Thus it is crucial to understand
better the plasma wave-particle interactions associated with collisionless
shocks in detail modeling of nonthermal radiation from SNRs.

of O and N abundances and specific star formation rates for different galaxy
mass ranges, demonstrating the galaxy downsizing effect caused by less massive
progenitors of less massive galaxies. The O and N abundances do not remain
constant for different galaxy mass ranges, and the enrichment (and hence star
formation) decreases with increasing galaxy stellar mass. We find evidence of
the O enrichment for galaxies with stellar masses $M_{*}>10^{11.0} $ (in units
of $M_{\odot}$), i.e. $\Delta({\log}({\rm O/H})) \sim 0.10$ and
$\Delta({\log}({\rm N/H})) \sim 0.28$ from redshift 0.023 to 0.30. Based on the
evolutionary schematic model of N/O ratios in Coziol et al., who proposed the
scheme that the production of nitrogen is the consequence of a sequence of
bursts in SFGs, we conclude that the nitrogen production is dominated by the
intermediate-mass stars, which dominate the secondary synthesis in SFGs.
However, for galaxies with $M_{*}>10^{10.35} $ we find evidence of enhanced N/O
abundance ratios, which are significantly above the secondary synthesis line.
This suggests that outflows of massive stars, which deplete oxygen efficiently,
are more important in massive galaxies. Finally we find an excellent linear
relation between $M_{*}$ and log(N/O), indicating that the N/O abundance ratio
is a good indicator of the stellar mass in a SFG and may be used as a standard
candle for studying cosmology, if confirmed with further studies.

empirically found in cortical networks and it has been conjectured that
operating at criticality entails functional advantages, such as optimal
computational capabilities, memory, and large dynamical ranges. As critical
behavior requires a high degree of fine tuning to emerge, some type of
self-tuning mechanism needs to be invoked. Here we show that, taking into
account the complex hierarchical-modular architecture of cortical networks, the

Using computational and analytical approaches, we find Griffiths phases in
synthetic hierarchical networks and also in empirical brain networks such as
the human connectome and the caenorhabditis elegans one. Stretched critical
regions, stemming from structural disorder, yield enhanced functionality in a
generic way, facilitating the task of self-organizing, adaptive, and

accuracy remains a primary challenge especially in mobile environments.
Existing approaches either appeal to physical layer information or rely on
extra wireless signals for high accuracy. In this paper, we revisit the RSS
fingerprint-based localization scheme and reveal crucial observations that act
as the root causes of localization errors, yet are surprisingly overlooked or
even unseen in previous works. Specifically, we recognize APs' diverse
discrimination for fingerprinting a specific location, observe the RSS
inconsistency caused by signal fluctuations and human body blockages, and
uncover the RSS outdated problem on commodity smartphones. Inspired by these
insights, we devise a discrimination factor to quantify different APs'
discrimination, incorporate robust regression to tolerate outlier measurements,
and reassemble different fingerprints to cope with outdated RSSs. Combining
these techniques in a unified solution, we propose DorFin, a novel scheme of
fingerprint generation, representation, and matching, which yields remarkable
accuracy without incurring extra cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
DorFin achieves mean error of 2 meters and more importantly, bounds the 95th
percentile error under 5.5 meters; these are about 56% and 69% lower,

have uncovered huge amounts of hot baryons filling up the deep gravitational
potential wells provided by dark matter (DM) halos with sizes of millions
light-years and masses of some 10^15 M_sun. At temperatures T~10^8 K and with
average densities of n~1 particle per liter, such baryons add up to some 10^14
M_sun. With the neutralizing electrons, they constitute the best
proton-electron plasma in the Universe (Intra Cluster Plasma, ICP). A key
physical feature of the ICP is constituted by its good local Thermal
equilibrium, and by its overall hydrostatic condition in the DM wells,
modulated by entropy. The latter is set up in the cluster center by the initial
halo collapse, and is progressively added at the outgrowing cluster boundary by
standing shocks in the supersonic flow of intergalactic gas into the DM wells.
We review these entropy-based models and discuss their outcomes and predictions
concerning the ICP observables in X rays and in microwaves. The results provide
a baseline for disentangling a number of additional and intriguing physical
processes superposed to the general equilibrium. We cover: the central entropy
erosion produced by radiative cooling vs. the intermittent energy inputs mainly
due to active galactic nuclei and mergers; outer turbulent support linked with
weakening shocks and decreasing inflow through the virial boundary, causing
reduced entropy production; the development from high to low entropy levels
throughout a typical cluster; perturbations of the equilibrium up to outright
disruption due to deep impacts of infalling galaxy groups or collisions with
comparable companion clusters; relativistic energy distributions of electrons
accelerated during such events, producing extended radio emission by
synchrotron radiation, and contributing to non-thermal pressure support for the
ICP.

application domains casually rely on data warehouses, which are
decision-oriented data repositories modeled as multidimensional (MD)
structures. MD structures help navigate data through hierarchical levels of
detail. In many real-world situations, hierarchies in MD models are complex,
which causes data aggregation issues, collectively known as the summarizability
problem. This problem leads to incorrect analyses and critically affects
decision making. To enforce summarizability, existing approaches alter either
MD models or data, and must be applied a priori, on a case-by-case basis, by an
expert. To alter neither models nor data, a few query-time approaches have been
proposed recently, but they only detect summarizability issues without solving
them. Thus, we propose in this paper a novel approach that automatically
detects and processes summarizability issues at query time, without requiring
any particular expertise from the user. Moreover, while most existing
approaches are based on the relational model, our approach focus on an XML MD
model, since XML data is customarily used to represent business data and its
format better copes with complex hierarchies than the relational model.
Finally, our experiments show that our method is likely to scale better than a
reference approach for addressing the summarizability problem in the MD
context.

  2012), Maui : United States (2012)",,,,"cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Business Intelligence plays an important role in decision making. Based on
data warehouses and Online Analytical Processing, a business intelligence tool
can be used to analyze complex data. Still, summarizability issues in data
warehouses cause ineffective analyses that may become critical problems to
businesses. To settle this issue, many researchers have studied and proposed
various solutions, both in relational and XML data warehouses. However, they
find difficulty in evaluating the performance of their proposals since the
available benchmarks lack complex hierarchies. In order to contribute to
summarizability analysis, this paper proposes an extension to the XML warehouse
benchmark (XWeB) with complex hierarchies. The benchmark enables us to generate
XML data warehouses with scalable complex hierarchies as well as
summarizability processing. We experimentally demonstrated that complex
hierarchies can definitely be included into a benchmark dataset, and that our
benchmark is able to compare two alternative approaches dealing with
summarizability issues.

weakly stable semilinear hyperbolic boundary value problems with pulse data.
Here weak stability means that exponentially growing modes are absent, but the
so-called uniform Lopatinskii condition fails at some boundary frequency in the
hyperbolic region. As a consequence of this degeneracy there is again an
amplification phenomenon: outgoing pulses of amplitude $O(\eps^2)$ and
wavelength $\eps$ give rise to reflected pulses of amplitude $O(\eps)$, so the
overall solution has amplitude $O(\eps)$. Moreover, the reflecting pulses
emanate from a radiating pulse that propagates in the boundary along a
characteristic of the Lopatinskii determinant. In the case of N*N systems
considered here, a single outgoing pulse produces on reflection a family of
incoming pulses traveling at different group velocities. Unlike wavetrains,
pulses do not interact to produce resonances that affect the leading order
profiles. However, pulse interactions do affect lower order profiles and so
these interactions have to be estimated carefully in the error analysis.
Whereas the error analysis in the wavetrain case dealt with small divisor
problems by approximating periodic profiles by trigonometric polynomials (which
amounts to using a high frequency cutoff), in the pulse case we approximate
decaying profiles with nonzero moments by profiles with zero moments (a low
frequency cutoff). Unlike the wavetrain case, we are now able to obtain a rate
of convergence in the limit describing convergence of approximate to exact
solutions.

image set based face recognition (ISFR) is becoming increasingly important. One
key issue of ISFR is how to effectively and efficiently represent the query

based methods ignore the relationship between gallery sets, while representing
the query set images individually over the gallery sets ignores the correlation
between query set images. In this paper, we propose a novel image set based
collaborative representation and classification method for ISFR. By modeling
the query set as a convex or regularized hull, we represent this hull
collaboratively over all the gallery sets. With the resolved representation
coefficients, the distance between the query set and each gallery set can then
be calculated for classification. The proposed model naturally and effectively
extends the image based collaborative representation to an image set based one,

of the proposed method to state-of-the-art ISFR methods under different set
sizes in terms of both recognition rate and efficiency.

defines a signal in pharmacovigilance as ""any reported information on a
possible causal relationship between an adverse event and a drug, the
relationship being unknown or incompletely documented previously"". For
spontaneous reporting systems, many machine learning methods are used to detect
ADRs, such as Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN), decision
support methods, genetic algorithms, knowledge based approaches, etc. One
limitation is the reporting mechanism to submit ADR reports, which has serious
underreporting and is not able to accurately quantify the corresponding risk.
Another limitation is hard to detect ADRs with small number of occurrences of
each drug-event association in the database. In this paper we propose feature
selection approach to detect ADRs from The Health Improvement Network (THIN)
database. First a feature matrix, which represents the medical events for the
patients before and after taking drugs, is created by linking patients'
prescriptions and corresponding medical events together. Then significant
features are selected based on feature selection methods, comparing the feature
matrix before patients take drugs with one after patients take drugs. Finally
the significant ADRs can be detected from thousands of medical events based on
corresponding features. Experiments are carried out on the drug Atorvastatin.
Good performance is achieved.

probability distributions P and Q. One receives either n i.i.d. samples from a
distribution p in P or from a distribution q in Q and wants to decide from
which set the points were sampled. It is known that the optimal exponential
rate at which errors decrease can be achieved by a simple maximum-likelihood
ratio test which does not depend on p or q, but only on the sets P and Q.
  We consider an adaptive generalization of this model where the choice of p in
P and q in Q can change in each sample in some way that depends arbitrarily on
the previous samples. In other words, in the k'th round, an adversary, having
observed all the previous samples in rounds 1,...,k-1, chooses p_k in P and q_k
in Q, with the goal of confusing the hypothesis test. We prove that even in
this case, the optimal exponential error rate can be achieved by a simple
maximum-likelihood test that depends only on P and Q.
  We then show that the adversarial model has applications in hypothesis
testing for quantum states using restricted measurements. For example, it can
be used to study the problem of distinguishing entangled states from the set of
all separable states using only measurements that can be implemented with local
operations and classical communication (LOCC). The basic idea is that in our
setup, the deleterious effects of entanglement can be simulated by an adaptive
classical adversary.
  We prove a quantum Stein's Lemma in this setting: In many circumstances, the
optimal hypothesis testing rate is equal to an appropriate notion of quantum
relative entropy between two states. In particular, our arguments yield an
alternate proof of Li and Winter's recent strengthening of strong subadditivity

with and without interfacial disorder is studied by a first-principles
noncollinear wave-function-matching method. It is shown that in the case of
clean interface the angular dependence of STT for CoCo/Al (the asymmetry
parameter Lambda approx. 4.5) is more skewed than that for MnSi/Al (Lambda
approx. 2.9), which suggests the clean CoCo/Al architecture is much more
efficient for the application on radio frequency oscillation. We also find that
even with interfacial disorder the spin-valve of half-metallic CMS still has a
relatively large parameter Lambda compared to that of conventional ferromagnet.
In addition, for clean interface the in-plane torkance of MnSi/Al is about
twice as large as that of CoCo/Al. However, as long as the degree of
interfacial disorder is sufficiently large, the CoCo/Al and MnSi/Al will show
approximately the same magnitude of in-plane torkance. Furthermore, our results
demonstrate that CMS/Al/CMS system has very high efficiency of STT to switch
the magnetic layer of spin-valve.

source and we measured its spectroscopic redshift z=6.107 with VLT/FORS. This
source could be associated with the putative SMG but it is most likely offset
spatially by 10-30kpc and they could be interacting galaxies. With a FIR
luminosity in the range [5-15]x10^{11} L_sol corresponding to a star formation
rate in the range [80-260]M_sol/yr, this SMG would be more representative than

distribution provides the density in the density of states approach to the sign
problem. We calculate this phase angle distribution using i) the hadron
resonance gas model; and ii) a combined strong coupling and hopping parameter
expansion in lattice gauge theory. While the former model leads only to a
Gaussian distribution, in the latter expansion we discover terms which cause
the phase angle distribution to deviate, by relative amounts proportional to
powers of the inverse lattice volume, from a simple Gaussian form. We show that
despite the tiny inverse-volume deviation of the phase angle distribution from

first (direct) detection of a large (35-40%) optical circumstellar flux
contribution and spatially resolve its emission region. Given this large amount
of reprocessed and/or redistributed optical light, the fitted size of the
emission region is rather compact and fits with(in) the inner rim of the
circumbinary dust disk. This rim dominates our K band data through thermal
emission and is rather compact, emitting significantly already at a radius of
twice the orbital separation. We interpret the circumstellar optical flux as
due to a scattering process, with the scatterers located in the extremely
puffed-up inner rim of the disk and possibly also in a bipolar outflow seen
pole-on. A non-LTE gaseous origin in an inner disk cannot be excluded but is
considered highly unlikely. This direct detection of a significant amount of
circumbinary light at optical wavelengths poses several significant questions

to stabilize dynamically at P~14 GPa and the trihydride at P > 25 GPa. In both

hydrogens, typical for covalent bonds. The trihydride exhibit molecular

down to zero transverse momentum, studying the $\mu^+\mu^-$ decay mode. In this
paper, the J/$\psi$ production cross section and the nuclear modification
factor $R_{\rm pPb}$ for the rapidities under study are presented. While at
forward rapidity, corresponding to the proton direction, a suppression of the
J/$\psi$ yield with respect to binary-scaled pp collisions is observed, in the
backward region no suppression is present. The ratio of the forward and
backward yields is also measured differentially in rapidity and transverse
momentum. Theoretical predictions based on nuclear shadowing, as well as on
models including, in addition, a contribution from partonic energy loss, are in
fair agreement with the experimental results.

LHCb detector in proton-lead collisions at a nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass

corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about $1.6 \mathrm{nb}^{-1}$. For
the first time the nuclear modification factor and forward-backward production
ratio are determined separately for prompt $J/\psi$ mesons and $J/\psi$ from
$b$-hadron decays. Clear suppression of prompt $J/\psi$ production with respect
to proton-proton collisions at large rapidity is observed, while the production
of $J/\psi$ from $b$-hadron decays is less suppressed. These results show good
agreement with available theoretical predictions. The measurement shows that
cold nuclear matter effects are important for interpretations of the related
quark-gluon plasma signatures in heavy-ion collisions.

cosmological solution in which inhomogeneity has a significant effect on the
expansion rate. The universe is modelled as a Swiss Cheese, with dust FRW
background and inhomogeneous holes. We show that if the holes are described by
the quasispherical Szekeres solution, their average expansion rate is close to
the background under certain rather general conditions. We specialise to
spherically symmetric holes and violate one of these conditions. As a result,
the average expansion rate at late times grows relative to the background, i.e.
backreaction is significant. The holes fit smoothly into the background, but
are larger on the inside than a corresponding background domain: we call them
Tardis regions. We study light propagation, find the effective equations of
state and consider the relation of the spatially averaged expansion rate to the
redshift and the angular diameter distance.

capacity of the pure-loss bosonic channel, first established in [Giovannetti et
al., Physical Review Letters 92, 027902 (2004), arXiv:quant-ph/0308012]. In
particular, we first prove that there exists a trade-off between communication
rate and error probability if one imposes only a mean-photon number constraint
on the channel inputs. That is, if we demand that the mean number of photons at
the channel input cannot be any larger than some positive number N_S, then it
is possible to respect this constraint with a code that operates at a rate
g(\eta N_S / (1-p)) where p is the code's error probability, \eta\ is the
channel transmissivity, and g(x) is the entropy of a bosonic thermal state with
mean photon number x. We then prove that a strong converse theorem holds for
the classical capacity of this channel (that such a rate-error trade-off cannot
occur) if one instead demands for a maximum photon number constraint, in such a
way that mostly all of the ""shadow"" of the average density operator for a given
code is required to be on a subspace with photon number no larger than n N_S,
so that the shadow outside this subspace vanishes as the number n of channel
uses becomes large. Finally, we prove that a small modification of the
well-known coherent-state coding scheme meets this more demanding constraint.

Even a more stable observable is the ratio between the yields in the positive

negligible by imposing a symmetric jet rapidity acceptance. Both observables
prove sensitive to the nuclear modifications of the gluon distributions, the
corresponding uncertainties clearly exceeding the estimated baseline
uncertainties from the free-proton PDFs and scale dependence. From a
theoretical point of view, these observables are therefore very suitable for
testing the validity of the collinear factorization and have a high potential
to provide precision constraints for the nuclear PDFs.

shown that the secrecy capacity is bounded. Moreover, when the channel to the

gravitationally bounded DM objects which have come into virial equilibrium at
the radiation-dominated (RD) stage of the universe evolution. Such objects can
be formed from the isocurvature (entropy) density perturbations or from the
peaks in the spectrum of curvature (adiabatic) perturbation. The axion
miniclusters (Kolb and Tkachev 1994) are the example of the former model. The
system of central compact mass (e. g. in the form of SDMC or primordial black
hole (PBH)) with the outer DM envelope formed in the process of secondary
accretion we refer to as UCMH. Therefore, the SDMC can serve as the seed for
the UCMH in some scenarios. Recently, the SDMC and UCMH were considered in the
many works, and we try to systematize them here. We consider also the effect of
asphericity of the initial density perturbation in the gravitational evolution,
which decreases the SDMC amount and, as the result, suppresses the gamma-ray
signal from DM annihilation.

of M31 GCs is high-resolution imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope, and we
have used HST data to derive structural parameters for 29 LMXB-hosting M31 GCs.
These measurements are combined with structural parameters from the literature
for a total of 41 (of 50 known) LMXB GCs and a comparison sample of 65 non-LMXB
GCs. Structural parameters measured in blue bandpasses are found to show
smaller core radii and higher concentrations than those measured in red
bandpasses; this difference is enhanced in LMXB clusters and could be related
to stellar population differences. Clusters with LMXBs show higher collision
rates for their mass compared to those without LMXBs and collision rates
estimated at the core radius show larger offsets than rates estimated at the
half-light radius. These results are consistent with the dynamical formation
scenario for LMXBs. A logistic regression analysis finds that, as expected, the
probability of a GC hosting an LMXB increases with increasing collision rate
and proximity to the galaxy center. The same analysis finds that P(LMXB)
decreases with increasing GC mass at a fixed collision rate, although we
caution that this could be due to sample selection effects. Metallicity is
found to be a less important predictor of P(LMXB) than collision rate, mass, or
distance, even though LMXB GCs have a higher metallicity on average. This may
be due to the interaction of location and metallicity: a sample of M31 LMXBs
with a greater range in galactocentric distance would likely contain more
metal-poor GCs and make it possible to disentangle the two effects.

feedback problem in the context of CoMP. Usually taking the assumptions: 1)
infinite SNR regime, 2) no user selection and 3) ideal link adaptation;
rendering the analysis too optimistic. In this paper we make a step forward
towards a more realistic assessment of the limited feedback problem by
introducing an improved metric for the performance evaluation which better
captures the throughput degradation. We find the relevant scaling laws (lower
and upper bounds) and how that they are different from existing ones. Moreover,
we provide a robust iterative interference alignment algorithm and
corresponding feedback strategies achieving the obtained scaling laws. The main
idea is that instead of sending the complete channel matrix each user fixes a
receive filter and feeds back a quantized version of the effective channel.

deblurring (FTVd) has been presented by Wang, Yang, Yin, and Zhang [{\em SIAM
J. Imaging Sci.}, 1 (2008), pp. 248--272]. The method in a nutshell consists of
a discrete Fourier transform-based alternating minimization algorithm with
periodic boundary conditions and in which two fast Fourier transforms (FFTs)
are required per iteration. In this paper, we propose an alternating
minimization algorithm for the continuous version of the total variation image
deblurring problem. We establish convergence of the proposed continuous
alternating minimization algorithm. The continuous setting is very useful to
have a unifying representation of the algorithm, independently of the discrete
approximation of the deconvolution problem, in particular concerning the
strategies for dealing with boundary artifacts. Indeed, an accurate restoration
of blurred and noisy images requires a proper treatment of the boundary. A
discrete version of our continuous alternating minimization algorithm is
obtained following two different strategies: the imposition of appropriate
boundary conditions and the enlargement of the domain. The first one is
computationally useful in the case of a symmetric blur, while the second one
can be efficiently applied for a nonsymmetric blur. Numerical tests show that
our algorithm generates higher quality images in comparable running times with
respect to the Fast Total Variation deconvolution algorithm.

We find that whereas the uncertainty on the halo-profile mass-concentration
relation is not a strong limitation, the uncertainty on the halo mass function
can severely limit the accuracy of theoretical predictions for $P(k)$ (this
also applies to the power spectra measured in numerical simulations). The
real-space correlation function provides a better separation between
perturbative and nonperturbative effects, which are restricted to $x \lesssim
10 h^{-1}$Mpc at all redshifts.

  point process model: application to high-frequency financial data",,,,,"q-fin.ST","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a careful analysis of possible issues on the application of the
self-excited Hawkes process to high-frequency financial data. We carefully
analyze a set of effects leading to significant biases in the estimation of the
""criticality index"" n that quantifies the degree of endogeneity of how much
past events trigger future events. We report a number of model biases that are
intrinsic to the estimation of brnaching ratio (n) when using power law memory
kernels. We demonstrate that the calibration of the Hawkes process on mixtures
of pure Poisson process with changes of regime leads to completely spurious
apparent critical values for the branching ratio (n~1) while the true value is
actually n=0. More generally, regime shifts on the parameters of the Hawkes
model and/or on the generating process itself are shown to systematically lead
to a significant upward bias in the estimation of the branching ratio. We also
demonstrate the importance of the preparation of the high-frequency financial
data and give special care to the decrease of quality of the timestamps of tick
data due to latency and grouping of messages to packets by the stock exchange.
Altogether, our careful exploration of the caveats of the calibration of the
Hawkes process stresses the need for considering all the above issues before
any conclusion can be sustained. In this respect, because the above effects are
plaguing their analyses, the claim by Hardiman, Bercot and Bouchaud (2013) that
financial market have been continuously functioning at or close to criticality
(n~1) cannot be supported. In contrast, our previous results on E-mini S&P 500
Futures Contracts and on major commodity future contracts are upheld.

cables the superconductor experiences a changing magnetic field in a DC

important task from the application design point of view. In this work, we
compare two formulations, the $H$-formulation and the minimum magnetic energy
variation (the MMEV-formulation), based on the eddy current model (ECM) and the
critical state model (CSM), respectively, in simulating ripple field losses in
a DC biased coated conductor tape. Furthermore, we compare our simulation
results with measurements. We investigate the frequency-dependence of the
hysteresis loss predictions of the power law based ECM and verify by a
measurement, that in DC use, ECM clearly over-estimates the homogenization of
the current density profile in the coated conductor tape: the relaxation of the
local current density is not nearly as prominent in the measurement as it is in
the simulation. Hence, we suggest that the power law resistivity, used as the
\emph{local} relation between the electric field intensity ${\bf E}$ and
current density ${\bf J}$ in ECM, is not an intrinsic property of
high-temperature superconductors. The difference between the models manifests
itself as discrepancies in ripple field loss simulations in very low AC fields
with significant DC fields or currents involved. The results also show,
however, that for many practical situations, CSM and ECM are both eligible
models for ripple field loss simulations.

successfully reproduce the gas fractions and gas-to-stellar mass ratios of HI
and H2 in local galaxies,as well as the HI and H2 disc sizes up to z<2. We
reach good agreement with the locally observed HI and H2 mass function,
although both recipes slightly overpredict the low-mass end of the HI mass
function. Both of our models predict that the high-mass end of the HI mass
function remains nearly constant at redshifts z < 2.0. The metallicity-based
recipe yields a higher cosmic density of cold gas and much lower cosmic H2
fraction over the entire redshift range probed than the pressure based recipe.
These strong differences in HI mass function and cosmic density between the two
recipes are driven by low mass galaxies (log (M*/Msun) < 7) residing in low
mass halos (log (Mvir/Msun) < 10). Both recipes predict that galaxy gas
fractions remain high from z ~ 6-3 and drop rapidly at lower redshift. The

and physical limits with continuous scaling, there is a growing push to look
for new platform to design memory circuits for nanoelectronic applications. In
this paper we explore new design concept of nonvolatile memory based on
graphene nanotechnology. The investigation focuses on two forms of graphene
based field effect transistor (FET) carbon nanotube FET (CNTFET) and graphene
nanoribbon FET (GNRFET). The analysis reveals that GNRFET with a high trapping
capable oxide layer is suitable for ultra high ensity nonvolatile memory.

is studied using concepts of truncation, regularization and connection
formulae. Following Aomoto's method, which involves regarding the $q$-series as
a solution of a $q$-difference equation fixed by its asymptotic behavior, an
infinite product evaluation is obtained. The $q$-difference equation is derived
applying the shifted symmetric polynomials introduced by Knop and Sahi. As a
special case of the infinite product formula, Askey--Evans's $q$-Selberg
integral evaluation and its generalization by Tarasov--Varchenko and Stokman is
reclaimed, and an explanation in the context of Aomoto's setting is thus
provided.

the energy of collective gravitational interactions of all particles in the
universe, which is missing in the standard treatments. For the model-universe
we estimate the radiation, baryon and dark energy densities and obtain the
values which are close to the current observations. It is shown that total
gravitational potential of a particle from the world ensemble is a scale
dependent quantity and its value is twice of Newtonian potential. The
Einstein-Infeld-Hoffmann approximation to general relativity was used to show
that the acceleration of a particle from the world ensemble can be considered
as a relative quantity when the universe is described by the flat cosmological
model.

necessary and sufficient number of significant digits in the coefficients of a
polynomial trend to achieve a pre-specified precision for the polynomial trend.
Thus, the obtained coefficients should be presented in the default output when
fitting the experimental data with the polynomial trend. Namely, when finding
the best fitting function for a certain type of data, there is a real
possibility of making significant errors when using the default output of the
Excel 2003, 2007, 2010, and 2013 and Statistica for Windows 2007-2012 software
packages. Conversely, the software package Mathematica (version 6) has been
very good at dealing with precision problems, although the default output
sometimes shows more significant digits than necessary.

  Applications,vol.5, p.91 (2013)(http://www.scirp.org/journal/jemaa)",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The present paper is based upon the fact that if an object is part of a
highly stable oscillating system, it is possible to obtain an extremely precise
measure for its mass in terms of the energy trapped in this resonance. The
subject is timely since there is great interest in Metrology on the
establishment of a new electronic standard for the kilogram. Our contribution
to such effort includes both the proposal of an alternative definition for mass
in terms of energy, as well as the description of a realistic experimental
system in which this definition might actually be applied. The setup consists
of an oscillating type-II superconducting loop (the SEO system) subjected to
the gravity and magnetic fields. The system is shown to be able to reach a
dynamic equilibrium by trapping energy up to the point it levitates against the
surrounding magnetic and gravitational fields, behaving as an extremely high-Q
spring-load system. The proposed energy-mass equation applied to the
electromechanical oscillating system eventually produces a new experimental
relation between mass and standardized constants.

function of these, with properties advantageous for establishing an accessible
proof that $\zeta(s)$ must also have all its zeros on the critical line: the
celebrated Riemann hypothesis. While the argument put forward is not at the
level of rigour required to constitute a full proof of the Riemann hypothesis,
it should convince non-specialists that it must hold.

and CTL+ has important applications in program specification and verification.
Their computational complexities are known: CTL* and CTL+ are complete for
doubly exponential time, CTL is complete for single exponential time. Some
decision procedures for these logics are known; they use tree automata,
tableaux or axiom systems. In this paper we present a uniform game-theoretic
framework for the satisfiability problem of these branching-time temporal
logics. We define satisfiability games for the full branching-time temporal
logic CTL* using a high-level definition of winning condition that captures the
essence of well-foundedness of least fixpoint unfoldings. These winning
conditions form formal languages of \omega-words. We analyse which kinds of
deterministic {\omega}-automata are needed in which case in order to recognise
these languages. We then obtain a reduction to the problem of solving parity or
B\""uchi games. The worst-case complexity of the obtained algorithms matches the
known lower bounds for these logics. This approach provides a uniform, yet
complexity-theoretically optimal treatment of satisfiability for branching-time
temporal logics. It separates the use of temporal logic machinery from the use
of automata thus preserving a syntactical relationship between the input
formula and the object that represents satisfiability, i.e. a winning strategy
in a parity or B\""uchi game. The games presented here work on a Fischer-Ladner
closure of the input formula only. Last but not least, the games presented here
come with an attempt at providing tool support for the satisfiability problem
of complex branching-time logics like CTL* and CTL+.

sensitive information are stored online and associated with SNS accounts. The
obvious value of SNS accounts motivates the usage stealing problem --
unauthorized, stealthy use of SNS accounts on the devices owned/used by account
owners without any technology hacks. For example, anxious parents may use their
kids' SNS accounts to inspect the kids' social status; husbands/wives may use
their spouses' SNS accounts to spot possible affairs. Usage stealing could
happen anywhere in any form, and seriously invades the privacy of account
owners. However, there is no any currently known defense against such usage
stealing. To an SNS operator (e.g., Facebook Inc.), usage stealing is hard to
detect using traditional methods because such attackers come from the same IP
addresses/devices, use the same credentials, and share the same accounts as the
owners do.
  In this paper, we propose a novel continuous authentication approach that
analyzes user browsing behavior to detect SNS usage stealing incidents. We use
Facebook as a case study and show that it is possible to detect such incidents
by analyzing SNS browsing behavior. Our experiment results show that our
proposal can achieve higher than 80% detection accuracy within 2 minutes, and
higher than 90% detection accuracy after 7 minutes of observation time.

walks on graphs representing transitions within networks of functional states.
Schmandt and Gal\'{a}n recently introduced a novel stochastic shielding
approximation as a fast, accurate method for generating approximate sample
paths from a finite state Markov process in which only a subset of states are
observable. For example, in ion channel models, such as the Hodgkin-Huxley or
other conductance based neural models, a nerve cell has a population of ion
channels whose states comprise the nodes of a graph, only some of which allow a
transmembrane current to pass. The stochastic shielding approximation consists
of neglecting fluctuations in the dynamics associated with edges in the graph
not directly affecting the observable states. We consider the problem of
finding the optimal complexity reducing mapping from a stochastic process on a
graph to an approximate process on a smaller sample space, as determined by the
choice of a particular linear measurement functional on the graph. The
partitioning of ion channel states into conducting versus nonconducting states
provides a case in point. In addition to establishing that Schmandt and
Gal\'{a}n's approximation is in fact optimal in a specific sense, we use recent
results from random matrix theory to provide heuristic error estimates for the
accuracy of the stochastic shielding approximation for an ensemble of random
graphs. Moreover, we provide a novel quantitative measure of the contribution
of individual transitions within the reaction graph to the accuracy of the
approximate process.

the large-scale displacement field is required by the method, this can be

becoming runaways or exiles, travelling with often-supersonic space velocities

impart kinetic energy and momentum to the ISM, compress and/or evaporate dense
clouds, and can constrain properties of both the star and the ISM. Here we
present one-, two-, and (the first) three-dimensional simulations of the H II
region around a massive star moving supersonically through a uniform,
magnetised ISM, with properties appropriate for the nearby O star Zeta Oph. The
H II region leaves an expanding overdense shell behind the star and, inside
this, an underdense wake that should be filled with hot gas from the shocked
stellar wind. The gas column density in the shell is strongly influenced by the
ISM magnetic field strength and orientation. H-alpha emission maps show the H
II region remains roughly circular, although the star is displaced somewhat
from the centre of emission. For our model parameters, the kinetic energy
feedback from the H II region is comparable to the mechanical luminosity of the
stellar wind, and the momentum feedback rate is >100X larger than that from the
wind and about 10X larger than the total momentum input rate available from
radiation pressure. Compared to the star's eventual supernova explosion, the
kinetic energy feedback from the H II region over the star's main sequence
lifetime is >100X less, but the momentum feedback is up to 4X larger. H II

performing a {\sl differential emission measure (DEM)} analysis to determine
the flare peak emission measure $EM_p$, peak temperature $T_p$, electron
density $n_p$, and thermal energy $E_{th}$, in addition to the spatial scales
$L$, areas $A$, and volumes $V$ measured in Paper I. The parameter ranges for M
and X-class flares are: $\log(EM_p)=47.0-50.5$, $T_p=5.0-17.8$ MK, $n_p=4
\times 10^9-9 \times 10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$, and thermal energies of $E_{th}=1.6
\times 10^{28}-1.1 \times 10^{32}$ erg. We find that these parameters obey the
Rosner-Tucker-Vaiana (RTV) scaling law $T_p^2 \propto n_p L$ and $H \propto
T^{7/2} L^{-2}$ during the peak time $t_p$ of the flare density $n_p$, when
energy balance between the heating rate $H$ and the conductive and radiative
loss rates is achieved for a short instant, and thus enables the applicability
of the RTV scaling law. The application of the RTV scaling law predicts
powerlaw distributions for all physical parameters, which we demonstrate with
numerical Monte-Carlo simulations as well as with analytical calculations. A
consequence of the RTV law is also that we can retrieve the size distribution
of heating rates, for which we find $N(H) \propto H^{-1.8}$, which is
consistent with the magnetic flux distribution $N(\Phi) \propto \Phi^{-1.85}$
observed by Parnell et al.(2009) and the heating flux scaling law $F_H \propto
H L \propto B/L$ of Schrijver et al.(2004). The fractal-diffusive
self-organized criticality model in conjunction with the RTV scaling law
reproduces the observed powerlaw distributions and their slopes for all
geometrical and physical parameters and can be used to predict the size

blocklength codes under buffer limitations is studied. Cognitive users first
determine the activity of the primary users' through channel sensing and then
initiate data transmission at a power level that depends on the channel sensing
decisions. It is assumed that finite blocklength codes are employed in the data
transmission phase. Hence, errors can occur in reception and retransmissions
can be required. Primary users' activities are modeled as a two-state Markov
chain and an eight-state Markov chain is constructed in order to model the
cognitive radio channel. Channel state information (CSI) is assumed to be
perfectly known by either the secondary receiver only or both the secondary
transmitter and receiver. In the absence of CSI at the transmitter, fixed-rate
transmission is performed whereas under perfect CSI knowledge, for a given
target error probability, the transmitter varies the rate according to the
channel conditions. Under these assumptions, throughput in the presence of
buffer constraints is determined by characterizing the maximum constant arrival
rates that can be supported by the cognitive radio channel while satisfying
certain limits on buffer violation probabilities. Tradeoffs between throughput,
buffer constraints, coding blocklength, and sensing duration for both
fixed-rate and variable-rate transmissions are analyzed numerically. The
relations between average error probability, sensing threshold and sensing
duration are studied in the case of variable-rate transmissions.

microgravity conditions naturally leads to a double-diffraction scheme. The two
pairs of counterpropagating beams induce simultaneously transitions with
opposite momentum transfer that, when acting on atoms initially at rest, give
rise to symmetric interferometer configurations where the total momentum
transfer is automatically doubled and where a number of noise sources and
systematic effects cancel out. Here we extend earlier implementations for Raman
transitions to the case of Bragg diffraction. In contrast with the
single-diffraction case, the existence of additional off-resonant transitions
between resonantly connected states precludes the use of the adiabatic
elimination technique. Nevertheless, we have been able to obtain analytic
results even beyond the deep Bragg regime by employing the so-called ""method of
averaging,"" which can be applied to more general situations of this kind. Our
results have been validated by comparison to numerical solutions of the basic
equations describing the double-diffraction process.

$\sum_{ij}C_{ij}x_ix_j$ over binary variables $x_i\in\{\pm1\}$, where C is a
positive semidefinite matrix. In this paper we focus on a natural
generalization of this problem, the little Grothendieck problem over the
orthogonal group. Given C a dn x dn positive semidefinite matrix, the objective
is to maximize $\sum_{ij}Tr (C_{ij}^TO_iO_j^T)$ restricting $O_i$ to take
values in the group of orthogonal matrices, where $C_{ij}$ denotes the (ij)-th
d x d block of C. We propose an approximation algorithm, which we refer to as
Orthogonal-Cut, to solve this problem and show a constant approximation ratio.
Our method is based on semidefinite programming. For a given $d\geq 1$, we show
a constant approximation ratio of $\alpha_{R}(d)^2$, where $\alpha_{R}(d)$ is
the expected average singular value of a d x d matrix with random Gaussian
$N(0,1/d)$ i.i.d. entries. For d=1 we recover the known $\alpha_{R}(1)^2=2/\pi$
approximation guarantee for the classical little Grothendieck problem. Our
algorithm and analysis naturally extends to the complex valued case also
providing a constant approximation ratio for the analogous problem over the
Unitary Group.
  Orthogonal-Cut also serves as an approximation algorithm for several
applications, including the Procrustes problem where it improves over the best
previously known approximation ratio of~$\frac1{2\sqrt{2}}$. The little
Grothendieck problem falls under the class of problems approximated by a recent
algorithm proposed in the context of the non-commutative Grothendieck
inequality. Nonetheless, our approach is simpler and it provides a more
efficient algorithm with better approximation ratios and matching integrality
gaps.
  Finally, we also provide an improved approximation algorithm for the more
general little Grothendieck problem over the orthogonal (or unitary) group with

The range of pressure in Native American flutes closely matches pressure
reported in other studies for normal speech, and the maximum intraoral
pressure, 20.55 mBar, is below the highest subglottal pressure reported in
other studies during singing. Results show that ethnic wind instruments, with
the exception of ethnic reed instruments, have generally lower intraoral

expected yet undetected molecular species (KCl, SiO, S2O) and isotopes (34SO2).
We analyze a disk-averaged spectrum of a potentially line-rich spectral window
around 345 GHz, obtained in 2010 at the APEX-12m antenna (Atacama Pathfinder
EXperiment). Using different models assuming either extended atmospheric
distributions or a purely volcanically-sustained atmosphere, we tentatively
measure the KCl relative abundance with respect to SO2 and derive a range of
4x10^{-4}-8x10^{-3}. We do not detect SiO or S2O and present new upper limits
on their abundances. We also present the first measurement of the 34S/32S
isotopic ratio in gas phase on Io, which appears to be twice as high as the
Earth and ISM reference values. Strong lines of SO2 and SO are also analyzed to
check for longitudinal variations of column density and relative abundance. Our
models show that, based on their predicted relative abundance with respect to
SO2 in volcanic plumes, both the tentative KCl detection and SiO upper limit
are compatible with a purely volcanic origin for these species.

the sample into star-forming and quenched galaxies, and to identify galaxies in
transition (the green valley). Despite a stark difference in visual appearance
between blue and red galaxies, their average radial stellar mass density
profiles are remarkably similar (especially in the outer regions) at fixed
mass. The inner stellar mass surface density within a radius of 1 kpc,
\Sigma_1, is used to quantify the growth of the bulge as galaxies evolve. When
galaxies are divided into narrow mass bins, their distribution in the
color-\Sigma_1 plane at fixed mass forms plausible evolutionary tracks.
\Sigma_1 seems to grow as galaxies evolve through the blue cloud, and once it
crosses a threshold value, galaxies are seen to quench at fixed \Sigma_1. The
\Sigma_1 threshold for quenching grows with stellar mass, \Sigma_1 ~
M_*^{0.64}. However, the existence of some star-forming galaxies above the
threshold \Sigma_1 implies that a dense bulge is necessary but not sufficient
to quench a galaxy fully. This would be consistent with a two-step quenching
process in which gas within a galaxy is removed or stabilized against star
formation by bulge-driven processes (such as a starburst, AGN feedback, or
morphological quenching), whereas external gas accretion is suppressed by
separate halo-driven processes (such as halo gas shock heating). Quenching thus
depends on an interplay between the inner structure of a galaxy and its
surrounding dark matter halo, and lack of perfect synchrony between the two
could produce the observed scatter in color vs. \Sigma_1. (Abridged)

describing many features of baryons and unifying them with the properties of

hadron bound-state problem. The following specific results are of particular
interest. The \Delta elastic form factors are very sensitive to m_\Delta.
Hence, given that the parameters which define extant simulations of

the form factors obtained therewith are a poor guide to properties of the

contentious. In connection with the N->\Delta transition, the Ash-convention

remnants (SNRs). The bubbles are created through activities of the
super-massive black hole (SMBH) or starbursts at the Galactic center (GC).
Cosmic-rays (CRs) are accelerated at the forward shocks of the bubbles like
SNRs, which means that we cannot decide whether the bubbles were created by the
SMBH or starbursts from the radiation from the CRs. We follow the evolution of
CR distribution by solving a diffusion-advection equation, considering the
reduction of the diffusion coefficient by CR streaming. In this model,
gamma-rays are created through hadronic interaction between CR protons and the
gas in the Galactic halo. In the GeV band, we can well reproduce the observed
flat distribution of gamma-ray surface brightness, because some amount of gas
is left behind the shock. The edge of the bubbles is fairly sharp owing to the
high gas density behind the shock and the reduction of the diffusion
coefficient there. The latter also contributes the hard gamma-ray spectrum of
the bubbles. We find that the CR acceleration at the shock has started when the
bubbles were small, and the time-scale of the energy injection at the GC was
much smaller than the age of the bubbles. We predict that if CRs are
accelerated to the TeV regime, the apparent bubble size should be larger in the
TeV band, which could be used to discriminate our hadronic model from other
leptonic models. We also present neutrino fluxes.

parsec scales, based on 15 GHz Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) data from a
sample of 133 AGN jets. This result is achieved through a new method for
measuring the product of the jet Lorentz factor and the intrinsic opening angle
Gamma*theta_j from measured apparent opening angles in flux density limited
samples of AGN jets. The Gamma*theta_j parameter is important for jet physics
because it is related to the jet-frame sidewise expansion speed and causal
connection between the jet edges and its symmetry axis. Most importantly, the
standard model of jet production requires that the jet be causally connected
with its symmetry axis, implying that Gamma*theta_j < 1. When we apply our
method to the MOJAVE flux density limited sample of radio loud objects, we find
Gamma*theta_j = 0.2, implying that AGN jets are causally connected. We also
find evidence that AGN jets viewed very close to the line of sight effectively
have smaller intrinsic opening angles compared with jets viewed more off-axis,
which is consistent with Doppler beaming and a fast inner spine/slow outer
sheath velocity field. Notably, gamma-ray burst (GRB) jets have a typical
Gamma*theta_j that is two orders of magnitude higher, suggesting that different
physical mechanisms are at work in GRB jets compared to AGN jets. A useful
application of our result is that a jet's beaming parameters can be derived.
Assuming Gamma*theta_j is approximately constant in the AGN jet population, an
individual jet's Doppler factor and Lorentz factor (and therefore also its
viewing angle) can be determined using two observable quantities: apparent jet
opening angle and the apparent speed of jet components.

of these regions' interstellar media (ISM). In most starbursts, the supernova
remnants blast open a hot phase that fills the regions and launches a
superwind. Denser starbursts are too overpressured for hot wind formation, but
supernovae still stir up the ISM. I argue that supernovae power ubiquitous
turbulence through each of the starburst ISM phases, including the hot wind,
and that a fluctuation dynamo amplifies magnetic fields until they are in
equipartition with the turbulence. Supernovae can drive turbulence with speeds
of ~1000 km/s in the hot wind and ~20 km/s in the cold molecular gas, depending
on the outer scale. I predict magnetic field strengths of 70 muG in the
Galactic Center starburst, 300 muG in M82 and NGC 253, and 2 mG in Arp 220's
nuclei. The mean magnetic field strengths are a few times stronger in molecular
gas than in hot winds, but do not vary strongly with density within a
starburst. I explain how the dominance of supernova-driven turbulence leads to
near equipartition between the components of starburst ISM. I also consider
implications for cosmic ray (CR) diffusion in starbursts. The high amounts of
power cascading to small scales could confine CRs very effectively in
starbursts, so much that CR transport is dominated by the flow of gas rather
than diffusion through the gas. In addition, I discuss the effects of
turbulence on X-ray line width, the far-infrared--radio correlation, observed
radio polarization, and Faraday rotation measures. Finally, I discuss the many
questions raised regarding the physics of turbulence in starbursts.

performed a deep search for the emission of HESS J0632+057 in the GeV energy

challenging due to the source being located in close proximity to the bright
\gamma-ray pulsar PSR J0633+0632 and lying in a crowded region of the Galactic
plane where there is prominent diffuse emission. We formulated a Bayesian block
algorithm adapted to work with weighted photon counts, in order to define the

deg circular region centred on the known location of HESS J0632+057 was

orbit also yielded no significant detection. A search for source emission on
shorter timescales (days--months) did not yield any significant detections. We
also report the results of a search for radio pulsations using the 100-m Green

of < 90/40 \mu Jy at 2/9 GHz. The LAT flux upper limits combined with the
detection of HESS J0632+057 in the 136-400 TeV energy band by the MAGIC

synchrotron emission arises outside them. Finally, noting that the hot

eigensolutions provide the light-front wavefunctions describing hadron

Hamiltonian satisfy a single-variable relativistic equation of motion,
analogous to the nonrelativistic radial Schrodinger equation, with an effective
confining potential U which systematically incorporates the effects of higher
quark and gluon Fock states. The potential U has a unique form if one requires
that the action for zero quark mass remains conformally invariant. The
holographic mapping of gravity in AdS space to QCD with a specific soft-wall
dilaton yields the same light-front Schrodinger equation. It also gives a
precise relation between the bound-state amplitudes in the fifth dimension z of
AdS space and the boost-invariant light-front wavefunctions describing the
internal structure of hadrons in physical space-time. The elastic and
transition form factors of the pion and the nucleons are found to be well
described in this framework. The predictions include a zero-mass pion in the
chiral limit, and linear Regge trajectories with the same slope in the radial
quantum number n and orbital angular momentum L. The light-front AdS/QCD
holographic approach thus gives a frame-independent representation of
color-confining dynamics and the excitation spectra of light-quark hadrons in
terms of a single mass parameter. We also discuss the implications of the
underlying conformal template of QCD for renormalization scale-setting and the
implications of light-front quantization for the value of the cosmological

general and apply it to vector and line bundles. We will prove that over
separated monoid schemes, any vector bundle is a coproduct of line bundles and
then go on to study the line bundles in more detail. Amongst other things, we
prove that over separated monoid schemes, ${\sf Pic}$ respects finite products.
  Next we will introduce the notion of $s$-cancellative monoids. They are
monoids for which $ax=ay$ implies that $(xy)^nx=(xy)^ny, n\in\mathbb{N}$. This
class is important since it is the biggest class of monoids for which
$M^*_{\mathfrak{p}}$ maps injectively into its group of fractions for every
prime ideal ${\mathfrak{p}}$. As we will see in section 6, this will enable us
to embed $\mathcal{O}^*_X$ injectively in a constant sheaf provided $X$ is
locally $s$-cancellative. We develop the theory of $s$-divisors and we prove
that for an $s$-cancellative monoid scheme $X$, the group ${\sf Pic}(X)$ can be
described in terms of $s$-divisors. For cancellative monoid schemes,
$s$-divisors agree with the Cartier divisors.
  We then introduce the notion of $s$-smooth monoid schemes, which generalise
smooth monoids schemes, and prove that for them $H^i(X,\mathcal{O}^*_X)=0$ for
all $i\geq 2$. Furthermore we show that it is a local property and respects
finite products.
  Finally we investigate the relationship between line bundles over a monoid
scheme $X$ and over its geometric realisation $X_k$, where $k$ is a commutative
ring. We prove that if $k$ is an integral domain (resp. principal ideal domain)
and $X$ is a cancellative and torsion free (resp. seminormal and torsion-free)
monoid scheme, then the induced map ${\sf Pic}(X)\to {\sf Pic}(X_k)$ is a
monomorphism (resp. isomorphism).

challenge to population geneticists due to their extreme diversity, which is
generated by high rates of recombination. These genes encode a primary antigen
protein called PfEMP1, which is expressed on the surface of infected red blood
cells and elicits protective immune responses. Var gene sequences are
characterized by pronounced mosaicism, precluding the use of traditional
phylogenetic tools that require bifurcating tree-like evolutionary
relationships. We present a new method that identifies highly variable regions
(HVRs), and then maps each HVR to a complex network in which each sequence is a
node and two nodes are linked if they share an exact match of significant
length. Here, networks of var genes that recombine freely are expected to have
a uniformly random structure, but constraints on recombination will produce
network communities that we identify using a stochastic block model. We
validate this method on synthetic data, showing that it correctly recovers
populations of constrained recombination, before applying it to the Duffy
Binding Like-{\alpha} (DBL{\alpha}) domain of var genes. We find nine HVRs
whose network communities map in distinctive ways to known DBL{\alpha}
classifications and clinical phenotypes. We show that the recombinational
constraints of some HVRs are correlated, while others are independent. These
findings suggest that this micromodular structuring facilitates independent
evolutionary trajectories of neighboring mosaic regions, allowing the parasite
to retain protein function while generating enormous sequence diversity. Our
approach therefore offers a rigorous method for analyzing evolutionary
constraints in var genes, and is also flexible enough to be easily applied more
generally to any highly recombinant sequences.

MAA instability on the original SN neutrino fluxes, performing a stability
analysis of the linearized neutrino equations of motion. We compare these
results with the numerical evolution of the SN neutrino non-linear equations,
looking at a local solution along a specific line of sight, under the
assumption that the transverse variations of the global solution are small. We
also assume that self-induced conversions are not suppressed by large matter
effects. We show that the pattern of the spectral crossings (energies where
F_{\nu_e} = F_{\nu_x}, and F_{\bar\nu_e} = F_{\bar\nu_x}) is crucial in
determining the impact of MAA effects on the flavor evolution. For neutrino
spectra with a strong excess of \nu_e over \bar\nu_e, presenting only a
single-crossing, MAA instabilities would trigger new flavor conversions in
normal mass hierarchy. In our simplified flavor evolution scheme, these would
lead to spectral swaps and splits analogous to what produced in inverted
hierarchy by the bimodal instability. Conversely, in the presence of spectra
with a moderate flavor hierarchy, having multiple crossing energies, MZA
effects would produce a sizable delay in the onset of the flavor conversions,
inhibiting the growth of the MAA instability. In this case the splitting
features for the oscillated spectra in both the mass hierarchies are the ones
induced by the only bimodal and MZA effects.

the set of points at which one cannot achieve a good formal structure without
blowing up. We show that when the polar divisor has normal crossings, the
turning locus is of pure codimension 1 within the polar divisor, and hence of
pure codimension 2 within the full space; this had been previously established
by Andre in the case of a smooth polar divisor. We also construct an
irregularity sheaf and its associated b-divisor, which measure irregularity

concrete consequence of these refinements is a process for resolution of
turning points which is functorial with respect to regular morphisms of
excellent schemes; this allows us to transfer the result from schemes to formal
schemes, complex analytic varieties, and nonarchimedean analytic varieties.

most of the work in theoretical computer science has so far concentrated on
markets without production, i.e., the exchange economy. This paper takes a
significant step towards understanding computational aspects of markets with
production.
  We first define the notion of separable, piecewise-linear concave (SPLC)
production by analogy with SPLC utility functions. We then obtain a linear
complementarity problem (LCP) formulation that captures exactly the set of
equilibria for Arrow-Debreu markets with SPLC utilities and SPLC production,
and we give a complementary pivot algorithm for finding an equilibrium. This
settles a question asked by Eaves in 1975 of extending his complementary pivot
algorithm to markets with production.
  Since this is a path-following algorithm, we obtain a proof of membership of
this problem in PPAD, using Todd, 1976. We also obtain an elementary proof of
existence of equilibrium (i.e., without using a fixed point theorem),
rationality, and oddness of the number of equilibria. We further give a proof
of PPAD-hardness for this problem and also for its restriction to markets with
linear utilities and SPLC production. Experiments show that our algorithm runs
fast on randomly chosen examples, and unlike previous approaches, it does not
suffer from issues of numerical instability. Additionally, it is strongly
polynomial when the number of goods or the number of agents and firms is
constant. This extends the result of Devanur and Kannan (2008) to markets with
production.
  Finally, we show that an LCP-based approach cannot be extended to PLC
(non-separable) production, by constructing an example which has only
irrational equilibria.

consists of multiple distributed local learners, that analyze different streams
of data that are correlated to a common event that needs to be classified. Each
learner uses a local classifier to make a local prediction. The local
predictions are then collected by each learner and combined using a weighted
majority rule to output the final prediction. We propose a novel online
ensemble learning algorithm to update the aggregation rule in order to adapt to
the underlying data dynamics. We rigorously determine a bound for the worst
case misclassification probability of our algorithm which depends on the
misclassification probabilities of the best static aggregation rule, and of the
best local classifier. Importantly, the worst case misclassification
probability of our algorithm tends asymptotically to 0 if the misclassification
probability of the best static aggregation rule or the misclassification
probability of the best local classifier tend to 0. Then we extend our
algorithm to address challenges specific to the distributed implementation and
we prove new bounds that apply to these settings. Finally, we test our scheme
by performing an evaluation study on several data sets. When applied to data
sets widely used by the literature dealing with dynamic data streams and

novelty is that the metric depends solely on the listings of the publications
of the members of a group, with no dependency on citation counts. R-Score has
some interesting properties: (a) it does not require access to the contents of
published material, (b) it can be curated to produce highly accurate results,
and (c) it can be naturally used to compare publication output of research
groups (e.g., graduate programs) inside a same country, geographical area, or
across the world. An experiment comparing the publication output of 25 CS
graduate programs from Brazil suggests that R-Score can be quite useful for
providing early insights into the publication patterns of the various research

coupled to AFM tips and traversed by antiparallel magnetic fields. Two kinds of
setups are analyzed, a monolayer of graphene and a two-dimensional electron gas
(2DEG). The AFM tips set the impurity levels at the Fermi energy, where two
contrasting behaviors emerge: the Fano factor for the graphene diverges, while
in the 2DEG it approaches zero. As result, the spin-degeneracy of the LDOS is
lifted exclusively in the graphene system, in particular for the asymmetric
regime of Fano interference. The aftermath of this limit is a counterintuitive
phenomenon, which consists of a dominant Fano factor due to the subsurface
impurity even with a stronger STM-adatom coupling. Thus we find a full
polarized conductance, achievable just by displacing vertically the position of
the STM tip. To the best knowledge, our work is the first to propose the Fano
effect as the mechanism to filter spins in graphene. This feature arises from
the massless Dirac electrons within the band structure and allows us to employ
the graphene host as a relativistic Fano spin-filter.

spectrograms of strain power. Clustering algorithms can be used to identify
candidate gravitational-wave events. Clusters are often identified by grouping
together seed pixels in which the power exceeds some threshold. If the
gravitational-wave signal is long-lived, however, the excess power may be
spread out over many pixels, none of which are bright enough to become seeds.
Without seeds, the problem of detection through clustering becomes more
complicated. In this paper we investigate seedless clustering algorithms in
searches for long-lived narrowband gravitational-wave bursts. Using four
astrophysically motivated test waveforms, we compare a seedless clustering
algorithm to two algorithms using seeds. We find that the seedless algorithm
can detect gravitational-wave signals (at fixed false-alarm and false-dismissal
rate) at distances between 150-200% greater than those achieved with the
seed-based clustering algorithms, corresponding to significantly increased
detection volumes: 420-740%. This improvement in sensitivity may extend the
reach of second-generation detectors such as Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo
deeper into astrophysically interesting distances.

density-functional band-structure calculations combined with quantum
Monte-Carlo simulations establish a relatively simple and non-frustrated model
of weakly coupled spin chains with the intrachain coupling of $J\sim$ 38 K and
the Neel temperature of $T_N\sim$ 6 K, both in excellent agreement with the
experiment. The intrachain coupling between the spin-1/2 V$^{+4}$ ions takes
place via two contiguous V$^{+5}$O$_4$ tetrahedra forming an extended
superexchange pathway with the V$^{+4}$--V$^{+4}$ distance of 7.44 A.
Surprisingly, this pathway is preferred over shorter V$^{+4}$--V$^{+4}$
connections, owing to peculiarities in the interacting orbitals of the magnetic
V$^{+4}$ ions and V$^{+5}$ ions that are non-magnetic, but feature low-lying
$3d$ states contributing to the superexchange process. We also note that the
crystal structure of BaV$_3$O$_8$ supports the long-sought uniform arrangement
of Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) couplings on a spin-1/2 chain. While our
calculations yield only a weak DM anisotropy in BaV$_3$O$_8$, the crystal
structure of this compound provides a suitable framework for the search of spin

  problems. On the shortcomings of the 2/3 de-aliasing method",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The high-order accuracy of Fourier method makes it the method of choice in
many large scale simulations. We discuss here the stability of Fourier method
for nonlinear evolution problems, focusing on the two prototypical cases of the
inviscid Burgers' equation and the multi-dimensional incompressible Euler
equations. The Fourier method for such problems with quadratic nonlinearities
comes in two main flavors. One is the spectral Fourier method. The other is the
2/3 pseudo-spectral Fourier method, where one removes the highest 1/3 portion
of the spectrum; this is often the method of choice to maintain the balance of
quadratic energy and avoid aliasing errors. Two main themes are discussed in
this paper. First, we prove that as long as the underlying exact solution has a
minimal C^{1+\alpha} spatial regularity, then both the spectral and the 2/3
pseudo-spectral Fourier methods are stable. Consequently, we prove their
spectral convergence for smooth solutions of the inviscid Burgers equation and
the incompressible Euler equations. On the other hand, we prove that after a
critical time at which the underlying solution lacks sufficient smoothness,
then both the spectral and the 2/3 pseudo-spectral Fourier methods exhibit
nonlinear instabilities which are realized through spurious oscillations. In
particular, after shock formation in inviscid Burgers' equation, the total
variation of bounded (pseudo-) spectral Fourier solutions must increase with
the number of increasing modes and we stipulate the analogous situation occurs
with the 3D incompressible Euler equations: the limiting Fourier solution is
shown to enforce L^2-energy conservation, and the contrast with energy
dissipating Onsager solutions is reflected through spurious oscillations.

Consequently, the potentially-diverse clinical applications of collagen-based
biomaterials cannot be fully realised. In order to establish defined
biomacromolecular systems for mineralised tissue applications, type I collagen
was functionalised with 1,3-Phenylenediacetic acid (Ph) and investigated at the
molecular, macroscopic and functional levels. Preserved triple helix
conformation was observed in obtained covalent networks via ATR-FTIR and WAXS,
while network crosslinking degree could be adjusted based on specific reaction
conditions. Decreased swelling ratio and increased thermo-mechanical properties
were observed compared to state of-the-art carbodiimide (EDC)-crosslinked
collagen controls, likely related to the intermolecular covalent incorporation
of the aromatic segment. Ph crosslinked hydrogels displayed nearly intact
material integrity and only a slight mass decrease following 1-week incubation
in either PBS or simulated body fluid (SBF), in contrast to EDC crosslinked
collagen. Furthermore, FTIR, SEM and EDS revealed deposition of a
calcium-phosphate phase on SBF-retrieved samples, whereby an increased calcium
phosphate ratio was observed in hydrogels with higher Ph content. 72-hour
material extracts were well tolerated by L929 mouse fibroblasts, whereby cell
confluence and metabolic activity (MTS assay) were comparable to those of cells
cultured in cell culture medium (positive control). In light of their

paper, a resonant electron-positron pair production process with the absorption
of two X-ray photons is considered in the impact of an energetic electron at
the overlap region of two colliding X-ray laser beams. Laser-dressed QED method
is justified to tackle the complexity of the corresponding multiple Feynman

positron energy distribution on the relative angles among the directions of the
two laser wave vectors and the incoming electron momentum is revealed. It is
shown that the non-plane wave laser field configuration arouses novel features

has an algebraic geometry flavour. This result was called Riemann-Roch formula
for graphs since it defines a combinatorial version of divisors and their ranks
in terms of configuration on graphs. The so called chip firing game on graphs
and the sandpile model in physics play a central role in this theory.
  In this paper we give a presentation of the theorem of Baker and Norine in
purely combinatorial terms, which is more accessible and shorter than the
original one. An algorithm for the determination of the rank of configurations
is also given for the complete graph $K_n$. This algorithm has linear
arithmetic complexity. The analysis of number of iterations in a less optimized
version of this algorithm leads to an apparently new parameter which we call
the prerank. This parameter and the classical area parameter provide an
alternative description to some well known $q,t$-Catalan numbers. Restricted to
a natural subset of configurations, the two natural statistics degree and rank
in Riemann-Roch formula lead to a distribution which is described by a
generating function which, up to a change of variables, is a symmetric fraction
involving two copies of Carlitz q-analogue of the Catalan numbers.

defines cells, which are regarded as discrete objects. The union of cells makes
up the state space of the dynamical systems. Our construction gives rise to a
combinatorial object - a timed automaton. We examine sound and complete
abstractions. An abstraction is said to be sound when the flow of the time
automata covers the flow lines of the dynamical systems. If the dynamics of the
dynamical system and the time automaton are equivalent, the abstraction is
complete.
  The commonly accepted paradigm for partitioning functions is that they ought
to be transversal to the studied vector field. We show that there is no
complete partitioning with transversal functions, even for particular dynamical
systems whose critical sets are isolated critical points. Therefore, we allow
the directional derivative along the vector field to be non-positive in this
work. This considerably complicates the abstraction technique. For
understanding dynamical systems, it is vital to study stable and unstable
manifolds and their intersections. These objects appear naturally in this work.
Indeed, we show that for an abstraction to be complete, the set of critical
points of an abstraction function shall contain either the stable or unstable
manifold of the dynamical system.

construction, coalescent modeling, and species delimitation, and we found that
the five co-distributed species exhibited discordant phylogeographic histories.
We also found that species trees and divergence times estimated from UCEs were
similar to those obtained from mtDNA. The species that inhabit the understory
had older divergence times across barriers, contained a higher number of
cryptic species, and exhibited larger effective population sizes relative to
species inhabiting the canopy. Because orthologous UCEs can be obtained from a
wide array of taxa, are polymorphic at shallow evolutionary time scales, and
can be generated rapidly at low cost, they are effective genetic markers for

transformed to a new frame moving with a velocity $\vec{V}$ has a form
$\vec{F}= q\vec{{E}} + q\vec{v} \times \vec{{B}}$, where
$\vec{{E}}=\vec{E}'_\parallel + \gamma\vec{E}'_\perp $ and $\vec{{B}}=
\vec{\frac{V}{c^2}} \times \vec{{E}}$ and $\vec{E}'$ is the electric field in
the rest frame of the source. The quantities $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$ are then
manifestly interdependent. We prove that they are determined by Maxwell's
equations, so they represent the electric and magnetic fields in the new frame
and the force $\vec{F}$ is the well known from experiments Lorentz force. In
this way Maxwell's equations may be discovered theoretically for this
particular situation of uniformly moving sources. The general solutions of the
discovered Maxwell's equations lead us to fields produced by accelerating
sources.

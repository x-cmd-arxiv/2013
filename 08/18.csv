matrix is constructed from a block-diagonal sensing matrix and the sparsifying
basis of the target signal. In this way, the projection of the signal onto the
sparsifying basis can be divided into several segments and all segments can be
reconstructed in parallel. Thus, the computational complexity and the time for
reconstruction can be reduced significantly. This feature is especially
appealing for big data processing. Furthermore, to reduce the number of
measurements needed to achieve the desired reconstruction error performance,
permutation is introduced for the projection of the signal. It is shown that
the permutation can be performed implicitly by using a pre-designed measurement
matrix. Thus, the permutation enhanced parallel reconstruction can be achieved
with a linear compressive sampling device.

it waits for the next tunneling step. Amazingly, we identify the three-step
configurations of sites, for which the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) is
negative, suggesting that the resistance for antiparallel magnetizations of the
electrodes is smaller than for parallel magnetizations. We analyze the phase
volume of these configurations with respect to magnitudes and relative
orientations of the on-site hyperfine fields. The effect of sign reversal of
TMR is exclusively due to interference of the spin-flip amplitudes on each
site, it does not emerge within commonly accepted probabilistic description of
spin transport. Another feature specific to multistep inelastic tunneling is
bouncing of electron between nearest neighbors while awaiting a ""hard"" hop. We
demonstrate that this bouncing, being absolutely insignificant for conduction
of current, can strongly affect the spin memory loss. This effect is also of

contradictions from discrete subgroups, with no restrictions on particle number
$N$ or dimension $d$ except for the fundamental requirement that $N \geq 3$ for

an electric field and takes advantage of the symbolic languages features and

(SFA), the effects of atomic potential on the motion of electron in the laser
field are neglected. The SFA has proven to be an essential tool in strong field
physics in the sense that it is able to predict with great precision the
harmonic (in the HHG) and energy (in the ATI) limits. We have extended
substantially the conventional classical simulations, where the electric field
is only dependent on time, including spatial nonhomogeneous fields and spatial
and temporal synthesized fields. Spatial nonhomogeneous fields appear when
metal nanosystems interact with strong and short laser pulses and temporal
synthesized fields are routinely generated in attosecond laboratories around
the world. Temporal and spatial synthesized fields have received special
attention nowadays because they would allow to exceed considerably the
conventional harmonic and electron energy frontiers. Classical simulations are
an invaluable tool to explore exhaustively the parameters domain at a cheap
computational cost, before massive quantum mechanical calculations, absolutely
indispensable for detailed analysis, are performed.

have difficult measurability issues and cannot be carried out in general. We
present a mixed value and policy iteration method that circumvents this
difficulty. The method allows the use of stationary policies in computing the
optimal cost function, in a manner that resembles policy iteration. It can also
be used to address similar difficulties of policy iteration in the context of
upper and lower semicontinuous models. We analyze the convergence of the method
in infinite horizon total cost problems, for the discounted case where the
one-stage costs are bounded, and for the undiscounted case where the one-stage
costs are nonpositive or nonnegative.
  For undiscounted total cost problems with nonnegative one-stage costs, we
also give a new convergence theorem for value iteration, which shows that value
iteration converges whenever it is initialized with a function that is above
the optimal cost function and yet bounded by a multiple of the optimal cost
function. This condition resembles Whittle's bridging condition and is partly
motivated by it. The theorem is also partly motivated by a result of Maitra and
Sudderth, which showed that value iteration, when initialized with the constant
function zero, could require a transfinite number of iterations to converge. We
use the new convergence theorem for value iteration to establish the
convergence of our mixed value and policy iteration method for the nonnegative

protected states on the surface due to the strong spin-orbit coupling. However,
a lack of ordered growth of TI thin films on amorphous dielectrics and/or
insulators presents a challenge for applications of TI-junctions. We report the
growth of topological insulator Bi2Se3 thin films on amorphous SiO2 by
molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). To achieve the ordered growth of Bi2Se3 on
amorphous surface, the formation of other phases at the interface is suppressed
by Se passivation. Structural characterizations reveal that Bi2Se3 films are
grown along the [001] direction with a good periodicity by van der Waals
epitaxy mechanism. Weak anti-localization effect of Bi2Se3 films grown on
amorphous SiO2 shows modulated electrical property by the gating response. Our
approach for ordered growth of Bi2Se3 on amorphous dielectric surface presents
considerable advantages for TI-junctions with amorphous insulator or dielectric

the low carrier mobility ({\mu}) in them as compared with corresponding bulk
structures, which constitutes the main hurdle for realizing high-performance
devices. To address this issue, we perform combined experimental and
theoretical study on atomically thin MoS2 field effect transistors with varying
the number of MoS2 layers (NLs). Experimentally, an intimate relation is
observed with a 10-fold degradation in {\mu} for extremely thinned monolayer
channels. To accurately describe the carrier scattering process and shed light
on the origin of the thinning-induced mobility degradation, a generalized
Coulomb scattering model is developed with strictly considering device
configurative conditions, i.e., asymmetric dielectric environments and lopsided
carrier distribution. We reveal that the carrier scattering from interfacial
Coulomb impurities (e.g., chemical residues, gaseous adsorbates and surface
dangling bonds) is greatly intensified in extremely thinned channels, resulting
from shortened interaction distance between impurities and carriers. Such a
pronounced factor may surpass lattice phonons and serve as dominant scatterers.
This understanding offers new insight into the thickness induced scattering
intensity, highlights the critical role of surface quality in electrical

classical and quantized electromagnetic fields in thin semiconductor films is
described within the framework of the nonequilibrium Green's function
formalism. For the coherent coupling to classical fields corresponding to
single field operator averages, an effective two-time intraband self-energy is
derived from a band decoupling procedure. The evaluation of coherent
photogeneration is performed self-consistently with the propagation of the
fields by using for the latter a transfer matrix formalism with an extinction
coefficient derived from the electronic Green's functions. For the ""incoherent""
coupling to fluctuations of the quantized fields, which need to be considered
for the inclusion of spontaneous emission, the first self-consistent Born
self-energy is used, with full spatial resolution in the photon Green's
functions. These are obtained from the numerical solution of Dyson and Keldysh
equations including a nonlocal photon self-energy based on the same interband
polarization function as used for the coherent case. A comparison of the
spectral and integral photocurrent generation pattern reveals a close agreement
between coherent and incoherent coupling for the case of an ultrathin,

safety- and mission-critical systems, despite the fact that designing
floating-point algorithms is significantly more difficult than designing
integer algorithms. For this reason, verification and validation of
floating-point computations is a hot research topic. An important verification
technique, especially in some industrial sectors, is testing. However,
generating test data for floating-point intensive programs proved to be a
challenging problem. Existing approaches usually resort to random or
search-based test data generation, but without symbolic reasoning it is almost
impossible to generate test inputs that execute complex paths controlled by
floating-point computations. Moreover, as constraint solvers over the reals or
the rationals do not natively support the handling of rounding errors, the need
arises for efficient constraint solvers over floating-point domains. In this
paper, we present and fully justify improved algorithms for the propagation of
arithmetic IEEE 754 binary floating-point constraints. The key point of these
algorithms is a generalization of an idea by B. Marre and C. Michel that

directly interface with end-users, so it is important to base the study and
design of access networks on the behaviors of and the actual performance
perceived by end-users. In this paper we study the effect of ISP traffic
shaping using traffic models based on user behaviors and
application/session-layer metrics providing quantifiable measures of
user-perceived performance for HTTP, FTP, and streaming video traffic. To
compare the user-perceived performance of shaped traffic flows with those of
unshaped ones in an integrated way, we use a multivariate non-inferiority
testing procedure. We first investigate the effect of the token generation rate
and the token bucket size of a token bucket filter on user-perceived
performance at a subscriber level with a single subscriber. Then we investigate
their effect at an access level where shaped traffic flows from multiple
subscribers interact with one another in a common shared access network. The
simulation results show that for a given token generation rate, a larger token
bucket provides better user-perceived performance at both subscriber and access
levels. It is also shown that the loose burst control resulting from the large
token bucket --- up to 100 MB for access line rate of 100 Mbit/s --- does not
negatively affect user-perceived performance with multiple subscribers even in
the presence of non-conformant subscribers; with a much larger token bucket,
however, the negative effect of non-conformant subscribers on the
user-perceived performance of conformant subscribers becomes clearly visible
because the impact of token bucket size and that of token generation rate are
virtually indistinguishable in this case.

Kolmogorov-type power laws to the lower envelopes of the velocity dispersion
spectra of the two species. This allows to calculate the turbulent ambipolar
diffusion scale, which in turn determines the plane-of-the-sky magnetic field
strength. We find turbulent ambipolar diffusion length scales of 3.8+-0.1 mpc

existing approaches are technically capable of determining such network
properties under certain assumptions, they mostly abstract away from primal
aspects that inherently have an essential impact on temporal network
performance dynamics. Also, they usually require auxiliary resources to be
implemented and deployed along with the actual network components. In the
course of developing a lightweight measurement-based alternative for the
self-inspection and prediction of volatile performance characteristics in
environments of any kind, we selectively investigate the duration of message
delivery and packet loss rate against various parameters peculiar to common
radio network technologies like Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Our hands-on
experiments reveal the relations between the oftentimes underestimated medium
access delay and a variety of main influencing factors including packet size,
backoff period, and number of neighbor nodes contending for the communication
medium. A closed formulation of selected weighted drivers facilitates the
average-case prediction of inter-node packet transfer delays for arbitrary
configurations of given network parameters even on resource-scarce WSN devices.
We validate our prediction method against basic multi-hop networking scenarios.
Yield field test results proof the basic feasibility and high precision of our
approach to network property estimation in virtue of self-governed local
measurements and regression-based calculations paving the way for a prospective
self-management of network properties based upon autonomous distributed

this purpose we use LCG H{\alpha} emission line luminosities from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectra and Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) FUV and
NUV continuum luminosities. The method is intended for quick estimation of m
and T in large galaxy samples and does not require spectral energy distribution
(SED) fitting. Estimated m and T for the sample of about 550 LCGs are compared
with the same values derived from the SED fitting in the wavelength range
\lambda\lambda 3800 -- 9200\AA. We obtain the average differences in log m and
T of 0.27 and 0.87 Myr, respectively. This technique could be used for
selection of galaxies with desired ranges of m and T or for reducing a range of
parameter variations in SED fitting.

projected separation of 55+-2 AU around the B9 type star {\kappa} Andromedae.
The properties of the system (mass ratio, separation) make it a benchmark for
the understanding of the formation and evolution of gas giant planets and brown
dwarfs on wide-orbits. We present new angular differential imaging (ADI) images
of the Kappa Andromedae system at 2.146 (Ks), 3.776 (L'), 4.052 (NB 4.05) and
4.78 {\mu}m (M') obtained with Keck/NIRC2 and LBTI/LMIRCam, as well as more
accurate near-infrared photometry of the star with the MIMIR instrument. We
derive a more accurate J = 15.86 +- 0.21, H = 14.95 +- 0.13, Ks = 14.32 +- 0.09

observations. We confirm previous contrasts obtained at Ks and L' band. We
derive NB 4.05 = 13.0 +- 0.2 and M' = 13.3 +- 0.3 mag and estimate
Log10(L/Lsun) = -3.76 +- 0.06. We build the 1-5 microns spectral energy
distribution of the companion and compare it to seven PHOENIX-based atmospheric
models in order to derive Teff = 1900+100-200 K. Models do not set constrains
on the surface gravity. ``Hot-start"" evolutionary models predict masses of
14+25-2 MJup based on the luminosity and temperature estimates, and considering
a conservative age range for the system (30+120-10 Myr). ``warm-start""
evolutionary tracks constrain the mass to M >= 11 MJup. Therefore, the mass of
{\kappa} Andromedae b mostly falls in the brown-dwarf regime, due to remaining
uncertainties in age and mass-luminosity models. According to the formation
models, disk instability in a primordial disk could account for the position
and a wide range of plausible masses of {\kappa} And b.

a smooth, proper, connected K-curve X and a skeleton \Gamma of the Berkovich
analytification X^\an, there are two natural real tori which one can consider:
the tropical Jacobian Jac(\Gamma) and the skeleton of the Berkovich
analytification Jac(X)^\an. We show that the skeleton of the Jacobian is
canonically isomorphic to the Jacobian of the skeleton as principally polarized
tropical abelian varieties. In addition, we show that the tropicalization of a
classical Abel-Jacobi map is a tropical Abel-Jacobi map. As a consequence of
these results, we deduce that \Lambda-rational principal divisors on \Gamma, in
the sense of tropical geometry, are exactly the retractions of principal
divisors on X. We actually prove a more precise result which says that,
although zeros and poles of divisors can cancel under the retraction map, in
order to lift a \Lambda-rational principal divisor on \Gamma to a principal
divisor on X it is never necessary to add more than g extra zeros and g extra
poles. Our results imply that a continuous function F:\Gamma -> R is the
restriction to \Gamma of -log|f| for some nonzero meromorphic function f on X
if and only if F is a \Lambda-rational tropical meromorphic function, and we
use this fact to prove that there is a rational map f : X --> P^3 whose
tropicalization, when restricted to \Gamma, is an isometry onto its image.

the origin of the mechanical degradation that these materials experience during
operation in nuclear power plants. Some of these effects can be studied by
using as model alloy the iron-carbon system.
  The Object Kinetic Monte Carlo technique has proven capable of simulating in
a realistic and quantitatively reliable way a whole irradiation process. We
have developed a model for simulating Fe-C systems using a physical description
of the properties of vacancy and self-interstitial atom (SIA) clusters, based
on a selection of the latest data from atomistic studies and other available
experimental and theoretical work from the literature. Based on these data, the
effect of carbon on radiation defect evolution has been largely understood in
terms of formation of immobile complexes with vacancies that in turn act as
traps for SIA clusters. It is found that this effect can be introduced using
generic traps for SIA and vacancy clusters, with a binding energy that depends
on the size of the clusters, also chosen on the basis on previously performed
atomistic studies.
  The model proved suitable to reproduce the results of low (<350 K)
temperature neutron irradiation experiments, as well as the corresponding
post-irradiation annealing up to 700 K, in terms of defect cluster densities
and size distribution, when compared to available experimental data from the
literature. The use of traps proved instrumental for our model.

It is found that in normal phase space the scaled factorial moment (ln<Fq>)
increases linearly with increase of the divided number of phase space (lnM) for
lower q-value and increases linearly with the increase of lnM and then becomes
saturated or decreased for higher q-value, in cumulative variable space ln<Fq>
decreases linearly with increase of lnM, which indicates that no evidence of
non-statistical multiplicity fluctuation is observed in our data sets. So any

of scientific research, though it is limited to low dimensions or specific
classes of states. Here we identify an additional class of quantum states, for
which bipartite entanglement measures can be efficiently computed, providing
new rigorous results. Such states are written in arbitrary $d\times d$
dimensions, where each basis state in the subsystem A is paired with only one
state in B. This new class, that we refer to as pair basis states, is
remarkably relevant in many physical situations, including quantum optics. We
find that negativity is a necessary and sufficient measure of entanglement for
mixtures of states written in the same pair basis. We also provide analytical
expressions for a tight lower-bound estimation of the entanglement of
formation, a central quantity in quantum information.

measurements with capacitance diaphragm gauges. They arise from the temperature
difference between the measurement volume and the temperature stabilised
manometer. Several approaches have been proposed to correct for the pressure
difference, but surface and geometric effects usually require that the
correction is determined for each gas type and gauge individually. Common
(semi) empirical corrections are based on studies of atoms or small molecules.
We present a simple calibration method for diaphragm gauges and compare
transpiration corrections for argon and styrene at pressures above 1 Pa. We
find that characteristic pressures at which the pressure difference reaches
half its maximum value, are compatible with the universal scaling p_{1/2} = 2
\{\eta} \cdot \{v_{th}} / d, thus essentially depending on gas viscosity \eta,
thermal molecular speed v_{th} and gauge tubing diameter d. This contradicts
current recommendations based on the Takaishi and Sensui formula, which show an
unphysical scaling with molecular size. Our results support the Miller or
\v{S}etina equations where the pressure dependency is basically determined by
the Knudsen number. The use of these two schemes is therefore recommended,
especially when thermal transpiration has to be predicted for new molecules.

m_med greater than 2.5 TeV. We find that the current limits on the contact
interaction scale Lambda in the EFT apply to theories that are perturbative for
dark matter mass m_DM < 800 GeV. However, for all values of m_DM in these
theories, the mediator width is larger than the mass, so that a particle-like
interpretation of the mediator is doubtful. Furthermore, consistency with the
thermal relic density occurs only for 170 <m_DM < 520 GeV. For lighter mediator
masses, the EFT limit either under-estimates the true limit (because the
process is resonantly enhanced) or over-estimates it (because the missing
energy distribution is too soft). We give some `rules of thumb' that can be
used to estimate the limit on Lambda (to an accuracy of about 50%) for any dark
matter and mediator masses from knowledge of the EFT limit. We also compare the
relative sensitivities of monojet and dark matter direct detection searches
finding that both dominate in different regions of the m_DM-m_med plane.
Comparing only the EFT limit with direct searches is misleading and can lead to

invariant correspondence estimation among deformable shapes. Most existing
approaches assume global consistency, i.e., the metric structure of the whole
manifold must not change significantly. While global isometric matching is well
understood, only a few heuristic solutions are known for partial matching.
Partial matching is particularly important for robustness to topological noise
(incomplete data and contacts), which is a common problem in real-world 3D
scanner data. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to partial, intrinsic
isometric matching. Our method is based on the observation that isometries are
fully determined by purely local information: a map of a single point and its
tangent space fixes an isometry for both global and the partial maps. From this
idea, we develop a new representation for partial isometric maps based on
equivalence classes of correspondences between pairs of points and their
tangent spaces. From this, we derive a local propagation algorithm that find
such mappings efficiently. In contrast to previous heuristics based on RANSAC
or expectation maximization, our method is based on a simple and sound
theoretical model and fully deterministic. We apply our approach to register
partial point clouds and compare it to the state-of-the-art methods, where we
obtain significant improvements over global methods for real-world data and
stronger guarantees than previous heuristic partial matching algorithms.

organization, with the bulk of the tumor composed of relatively differentiated
short-lived progenitor cells that are maintained by a small population of
undifferentiated long-lived cancer stem cells. It is unclear, however, whether
cancer stem cells originate from normal stem cells or from dedifferentiated
progenitor cells. To address this, we mathematically modeled the effect of
dedifferentiation on carcinogenesis. We considered a hybrid
stochastic-deterministic model of mutation accumulation in both stem cells and
progenitors, including dedifferentiation of progenitor cells to a stem
cell-like state. We performed exact computer simulations of the emergence of
tumor subpopulations with two mutations, and we derived semi-analytical
estimates for the waiting time distribution to fixation. Our results suggest
that dedifferentiation may play an important role in carcinogenesis, depending
on how stem cell homeostasis is maintained. If the stem cell population size is
held strictly constant (due to all divisions being asymmetric), we found that
dedifferentiation acts like a positive selective force in the stem cell
population and thus speeds carcinogenesis. If the stem cell population size is
allowed to vary stochastically with density-dependent reproduction rates
(allowing both symmetric and asymmetric divisions), we found that
dedifferentiation beyond a critical threshold leads to exponential growth of
the stem cell population. Thus, dedifferentiation may play a crucial role, the
common modeling assumption of constant stem cell population size may not be
adequate, and further progress in understanding carcinogenesis demands a more
detailed mechanistic understanding of stem cell homeostasis.

the host galaxy redshifts, we test the impact of photometric SN classification
based on SDSS imaging data with and without using spectroscopic redshifts of
the host galaxies. Following our suggested scheme, there are a total of 1166
photometrically classified SNe Ia when using a flat redshift prior and 1126 SNe
Ia when the host spectroscopic redshift is assumed. For 1024 (87.8%) candidates
classified as likely SNe Ia without redshift information, we find that the
classification is unchanged when adding the host galaxy redshift. Using
photometry from SDSS imaging data and the host galaxy spectra, we also report
host galaxy properties for use in future nalysis of SN astrophysics. Finally,
we investigate the differences in the interpretation of the light curve
properties with and without knowledge of the redshift. When using the SALT2
light curve fitter, we find a 21% increase in the number of fits that converge
when using the spectroscopic redshift. Without host galaxy redshifts, we find
that SALT2 light curve fits are systematically biased towards lower photometric
redshift estimates and redder colors in the limit of low signal-to-noise data.
The general improvements in performance of the light curve fitter and the
increased diversity of the host galaxy sample highlights the importance of host
galaxy spectroscopy for current photometric SN surveys such as the Dark Energy

evolution of disc galaxies. Even at their maximum resolution, they still follow
a limited number of particles and typically resolve scales of the order of a
few tens of parsecs. Generally, the spatial resolution is defined by (some
multiple of) the softening length, whose value is set as a compromise between
the desired resolution and the need for limiting small-scale noise. Several
works have studied the question whether a softening scale fixed in space and
time provides a good enough modelling of an astrophysical system. Here we
address this question within the context of dynamical simulations and disc
instabilities. We first follow the evolution of a galaxy-like object in
isolation and then set up a simulation of an idealised merger event. Alongside
a run using the standard fixed-softening approach, we performed simulations
where the softening lengths were let to vary from particle to particle
according to the evolution of the local density field in space and time. Even
though during the most violent phases of the merging the fixed-softening
simulation tends to underestimate the resulting matter densities, as far as the
evolution of the disc component is concerned we found no significant
differences among the runs. We conclude that using an appropriate fixed
softening scale is a safe approach to the problem of modelling an N-body,
non-cosmological disc galaxy system.

positively charged ion channel by expelling plasma electrons in the transverse
direction. We consider the dynamics of a test electron in a resulting
two-dimensional channel under the action of the laser field and the transverse
electric field of the channel. A considerable enhancement of the axial momentum
can be achieved in this case via amplification of betatron oscillations. It is
shown that the oscillations can be parametrically amplified when the betatron
frequency, which increases with the wave amplitude, becomes comparable to the
frequency of its modulations. The modulations are caused by non-inertial
(accelerated/decelerated) relativistic axial motion induced by the wave
regardless of the angle between the laser electric field and the field of the
channel. We have performed a parameter scan for a wide range of wave amplitudes
and ion densities and we have found that, for a given density, there is a well
pronounced wave amplitude threshold above which the maximum electron energy is
considerably enhanced. We have also calculated a time-integrated electron
spectrum produced by an ensemble of electrons with a spread in the initial
transverse momentum. The numerical results show that the considerable energy
enhancement is accompanied by spectrum broadening. The presented mechanism of
energy enhancement is robust with respect to an axial increase of ion density,
because it relies on a threshold phenomenon rather than on a narrow linear
resonance.

environments. There are two main mechanisms by which the wind affects these
plants: (i) sand drift exposes roots and covers branches--the exposed roots
turn into new plants and the covered branches turn into new roots; both
mechanisms result in an enhanced growth rate of the psammophilous plant cover
of the dunes; (ii) strong winds, often associated with sand movement, tear
branches and seed them in nearby locations, resulting in new plants and an
enhanced growth rate of the psammophilous plant cover of the dunes. Despite
their important role in dune dynamics, to our knowledge, psammophilous plants
have never been incorporated into mathematical models of sand dunes. Here, we
attempt to model the effects of these plants on sand dune dynamics. We
construct a set of three ordinary differential equations for the fractions of
surface cover of regular vegetation, biogenic soil crust and psammophilous
plants. The latter reach their optimal growth under (i) specific sand drift or
(ii) specific wind power. We show that psammophilous plants enrich the sand
dune dynamics. Depending on the climatological conditions, it is possible to
obtain one, two, or three steady dune states. The activity of the dunes can be
associated with the surface cover--bare dunes are active, and dunes with
significant cover of vegetation, biogenic soil crust, or psammophilous plants
are fixed. Our model shows that under suitable precipitation rates and wind
power, the dynamics of the different cover types is in accordance with the
common view that dunes are initially stabilized by psammophilous plants that
reduce sand activity, thus enhancing the growth of regular vegetation that
eventually dominates the cover of the dunes and determines their activity.

show that these pseudopotential Hamiltonians can be approximated by

contributions to the questions of (i) complexity of deciding stability, (ii)
existence of polynomial Lyapunov functions, and (iii) existence of sum of
squares (sos) Lyapunov functions.
  (i) We show that deciding local or global asymptotic stability of cubic
vector fields is strongly NP-hard. Simple variations of our proof are shown to
imply strong NP-hardness of several other decision problems: testing local
attractivity of an equilibrium point, stability of an equilibrium point in the
sense of Lyapunov, invariance of the unit ball, boundedness of trajectories,
convergence of all trajectories in a ball to a given equilibrium point,
existence of a quadratic Lyapunov function, local collision avoidance, and
existence of a stabilizing control law.
  (ii) We present a simple, explicit example of a globally asymptotically
stable quadratic vector field on the plane which does not admit a polynomial
Lyapunov function (joint work with M. Krstic). For the subclass of homogeneous
vector fields, we conjecture that asymptotic stability implies existence of a
polynomial Lyapunov function, but show that the minimum degree of such a
Lyapunov function can be arbitrarily large even for vector fields in fixed
dimension and degree. For the same class of vector fields, we further establish
that there is no monotonicity in the degree of polynomial Lyapunov functions.
  (iii) We show via an explicit counterexample that if the degree of the
polynomial Lyapunov function is fixed, then sos programming may fail to find a
valid Lyapunov function even though one exists. On the other hand, if the
degree is allowed to increase, we prove that existence of a polynomial Lyapunov
function for a planar or a homogeneous vector field implies existence of a
polynomial Lyapunov function that is sos and that the negative of its
derivative is also sos.

are flat or increasing out to a break before falling off. Here we re-examine
the stellar disk profiles of 141 dwarfs: 96 dwarf irregulars (dIms), 26 Blue
Compact Dwarfs (BCDs), and 19 Magellanic-type spirals (Sms). We fit single,
double, or even triple exponential profiles in up to 11 passbands: GALEX FUV
and NUV, ground-based UBV JHK and H{\alpha}, and Spitzer 3.6 and 4.5 {\mu}m. We
find that more luminous galaxies have brighter centers, larger inner and outer
scale lengths, and break at larger radii; dwarf trends with M_B extend to
spirals. However, the V-band break surface brightness is independent of break
type, M_B, and Hubble type. Dwarf Type II and III profiles fall off similarly
beyond the breaks but have different interiors and IIs break ~twice as far as
IIIs. Outer Type II and III scale lengths may have weak trends with wavelength,
but pure Type II inner scale lengths clearly decrease from the FUV to visible
bands whereas Type III inner scale lengths increase with redder bands. This
suggests the influence of different star formation histories on profile type,
but nonetheless the break location is approximately the same in all passbands.
Dwarfs continue trends between profile and Hubble types such that later-type
galaxies have more Type II but fewer Type I and III profiles than early-type
spirals. BCDs and Sms are over-represented as Types III and II, respectively,
compared to dIms.

intracluster light (ICL). All PNs are identified through the on-off band
technique using automatic selection criteria based on the distribution of the

m_5007=28.4, with an estimated residual contamination from foreground stars and
background Lyalpha galaxies, which amounts to ~35% of the sample. This is one
of the largest extragalactic PN samples in number of candidates, magnitude
depth, and radial extent, which allows us to carry out an unprecedented
photometric study of the PN population in the outer regions of M87. We find
that the logarithmic density profile of the PN distribution is shallower than
the surface brightness profile at large radii. This behaviour is consistent
with the superposition of two components associated with the halo of M87 and
with the ICL, which have different luminosity specific PN numbers, the ICL
contributing three times more PNs per unit light. Because of the depth of this
survey we are also able to study the shape of the PN luminosity function (PNLF)
in the outer regions of M87. We find a slope for the PNLF that is steeper at
fainter magnitudes than the standard analytical PNLF formula and adopt a
generalised model that treats the slope as a free parameter. Comparing the PNLF

planets around WDs. Here we propose to take advantage of the unique capability
of the Kepler spacecraft in the 2-Wheels mode to perform a transit survey that
is capable of identifying the first planets in the habitable zone of a WD. We
propose to obtain Kepler time-series photometry of 10,000 WDs in the SDSS
imaging area to search for planets in the habitable zone. Thanks to the large
field of view of Kepler, for the first time in history, a large number of WDs
can be observed at the same time, which is essential for discovering transits.
Our proposed survey requires a total of 200 days of observing time, and will
find up to 100 planets in the WD habitable zone. This survey will maintain
Kepler's spirit of searching for habitable Earths, but near new hosts. With
few-day observations and minute-cadences per field, it will also open up a
completely unexplored discovery space. In addition to planets, this survey is
sensitive to pulsating WDs, as well as eclipsing short period stellar and
substellar companions. These have important implications for constraining the
double WD merger rate and their contribution to Type Ia supernovae and the
gravitational wave foreground. Given the relatively low number density of our
targets, this program can be combined with other projects that would benefit
from high cadence and many-fields observations with Kepler, e.g. a transit

(gas-giant planets with 10 d <~ P <~ 100 d) by high-eccentricity (high-e)
migration mechanisms. Unlike hot Jupiters, the majority of observed warm
Jupiters have pericenter distances too large to allow efficient tidal
dissipation to induce migration. To access the close pericenter required for
migration during a Kozai-Lidov cycle, they must be accompanied by a strong
enough perturber to overcome the precession caused by General Relativity (GR),
placing a strong upper limit on the perturber's separation. For a warm Jupiter
at a ~ 0.2 AU, a Jupiter-mass (solar-mass) perturber is required to be <~ 3 AU
(<~ 30 AU) and can be identified observationally. Among warm Jupiters detected
by Radial Velocities (RV), >~ 50% (5 out of 9) with large eccentricities (e >~
0.4) have known Jovian companions satisfying this necessary condition for
high-e migration. In contrast, <~ 20 % (3 out of 17) of the low-e (e <~ 0.2)
warm Jupiters have detected additional Jovian companions, suggesting that
high-e migration with planetary perturbers may not be the dominant formation
channel. Complete, long-term RV follow-ups of the warm-Jupiter population will
allow a firm upper limit to be put on the fraction of these planets formed by
high-e migration. Transiting warm Jupiters showing spin-orbit misalignments
will be interesting to apply our test. If the misalignments are solely due to
high-e migration as commonly suggested, we expect that the majority of warm
Jupiters with low-e (e <~0.2) are not misaligned, in contrast with low-e hot
Jupiters.

km/s FWHM is too narrow to be supported by dynamical pressure. The gas may
instead be supported in a rotating, turbulent disk oriented nearly face-on. The

solar masses of molecular gas is projected 3-10 kpc to the north-west and to
the east of the nucleus with line of sight velocities lying between -250 km/s

ruled out, the rising velocity gradient with radius is consistent with a broad,
bipolar outflow driven by radio jets or buoyantly rising X-ray cavities. The
molecular outflow may be associated with an outflow of hot gas in Abell 1835
seen on larger scales. Molecular gas is flowing out of the BCG at a rate of
approximately 200 solar masses per year, which is comparable to its star
formation rate. How radio bubbles lift dense molecular gas in their updrafts,
how much gas will be lost to the BCG, and how much will return to fuel future

radio-mechanical (radio mode) feedback not only heats hot atmospheres

velocity systems: one from -250 to +250 km/s centred on the BCG's systemic
velocity and a high velocity system blueshifted by 570 km/s with respect to the
systemic velocity. The BCG's systemic component shows a smooth velocity
gradient across the BCG center with velocity proportional to radius suggestive
of solid body rotation about the nucleus. However, the mass and velocity
structure are highly asymmetric and there is little star formation coincident
with a putative disk. It may be an inflow of gas that will settle into a disk
over several 10^8 yr. The high velocity system consists of two gas clumps, each
~2 kpc across, located to the north and southeast of the nucleus. Each has a
line of sight velocity spread of 250-300 km/s. The velocity of the gas in the
high velocity system tends to increase towards the BCG center and could signify
a massive high velocity flow onto the nucleus. However, the velocity gradient
is not smooth and these structures are also coincident with low optical-UV
surface brightness regions, which could indicate dust extinction associated
with each clump. If so, the high velocity gas would be projected in front of
the BCG and moving toward us along the line of sight in a massive outflow most
likely driven by the AGN. A merger origin is unlikely but cannot be ruled out.

strong dependence of the dielectric constant on the magnetic field is observed

magnetic hysteresis suggesting that spin-spin interactions are the mechanism

SLRs, and often consider only cosmic rays (CRs), because of the high CR-rate

modest stellar winds, resulting in severely modulated CR ionization rates,
$\zeta_{\rm{CR}}$, equal to or substantially below that of SLRs

particle fluxes and corresponding ionization rates as a function of position

minimum-cost sum-of-primes representation of a Boolean function f when the cost
function C is positive and additive. A set of primes whose sum equals f is
called a basis for f, so a solution to the problem is a minimum-cost basis.
  The algorithms construct the following canonical partition of the complete
set of primes and identify the members of sets 1, 2, and 3:
  (1) Essential Primes, which must be part of any basis for f,
  (2) Unnecessary Primes that cannot be part of a minimum-cost basis for f for
any positive additive cost function,
  (3) Unique disjoint sets of primes, PS1,...,PSN with associated ""covering""
tables TS1,..., TSN such that any minimum-cost basis consists of the union of
the sets
  Essential Primes, QS1(C), ..., QSN(C) where QSi(C) is contained in PSi and
QSi(C) is a minimum-cost ""cover"" for PSi. Covering is defined by operation
Cascade(QS, TS), which has the property that QS covers PS if and only if
Cascade(QS, TS) is empty.
  The key to the results is the study of objects called Ancestor Sets. The
Ancestor Theorem proves that if A is an Ancestor Set for f, every minimum-cost
basis includes a minimum-cost cover for the set of primes PS in Ancestor Set A
and a minimum-cost cover for the set of primes that are not in A (and are not
covered by the the union of the Essentials with PS). The PSi in the partition
are the sets of primes in canonical disjoint Independent Ancestor Sets Ai,
which are easy to generate when the calculation of the primes (and their
consensus combinations) is within computational scope. The paper also presents
a condition under which QSi(C) can be easily determined, and another condition

magnetic Dartmouth stellar evolution code. In particular, we focus on stars
thought to have a radiative core and convective outer envelope by studying in
detail three individual DEBs: UV Psc, YY Gem, and CU Cnc. The results suggest
that the stabilization of thermal convection by a magnetic field is a plausible
explanation for the observed model-radius discrepancies. However, surface
magnetic field strengths required by the models are significantly stronger than
those estimated from the observed coronal X-ray emission. Agreement between
model predicted surface magnetic field strengths and those inferred from X-ray
observations can be found by assuming that the magnetic field sources its
energy from convection. This approach makes the transport of heat by convection
less efficient and is akin to reduced convective mixing length methods used in
other studies. Predictions for the metallicity and magnetic field strengths of
the aforementioned systems are reported. We also develop an expression relating
a reduction in the convective mixing length to a magnetic field strength in
units of the equipartition value. Our results are compared with those from
previous investigations to incorporate magnetic fields to explain the low-mass
DEB radius inflation. Finally, we explore how the effects of magnetic fields

that the system undergoes a nonequilibrium first-order phase transition from a

Here we show that enhanced flow properties can also be observed in these

regular lattice over which long-range connections are randomly added according
to the probability, $P_{ij}\sim r_{ij}^{-\alpha}$, where $r_{ij}$ is the
Manhattan distance between nodes $i$ and $j$, and the exponent $\alpha$ is a
controlling parameter. The mean two-point global conductance of the system is
computed by considering that each link has a local conductance given by
$g_{ij}\propto r_{ij}^{-\delta}$, where $\delta$ determines the extent of the
geographical limitations (costs) on the long-range connections. Our results
show that the best flow conditions are obtained for $\delta=0$ with $\alpha=0$,
while for $\delta \gg 1$ the overall conductance always increases with
$\alpha$. For $\delta\approx 1$, $\alpha=d$ becomes the optimal exponent, where
$d$ is the topological dimension of the substrate. Interestingly, this exponent
is identical to the one obtained for optimal navigation in small-world networks

interior structure of giant planets. Motivated by these observations, we study
the non-radial oscillation modes of giant planets containing a solid core. Our
calculations include the elastic response of the core and consider a wide range
of possible values of the core shear modulus. While the elasticity of the core
only slightly changes the frequencies of acoustic modes, which reside mostly in
the fluid envelope, it adds two new classes of shear modes that are largely
confined to the core. We also calculate the effects of the Coriolis force on
the planetary oscillation modes. In addition to changing the mode frequencies,
the Coriolis force can cause the shear modes to mix with the f-modes. Such
mixing occurs when the frequencies of the shear mode and the f-mode are close
to each other, and results in ""mixed modes"" with similar properties that are
slightly split in frequency. We discuss our results in light of the recent work
by Hedman & Nicholson (2013), which revealed the presence of density waves in
Saturn's C-ring that appear to be excited by the gravitational perturbations
associated with the f-mode oscillations within Saturn. We find that the fine
splitting in wave frequencies observed in the rings can in principle be
explained by the rotation-induced mixing between core shear modes and f-modes,
possibly indicating the presence of a solid core within Saturn. However, in our
current calculations, which assume rigid-body rotation and include only
first-order rotational effects, significant fine-tuning in the planetary model
parameters is needed in order to achieve these mode mixings and to explain the
observed fine frequency splitting. We briefly discuss other effects that may
modify the f-modes and facilitate mode mixing.

promote quality and reliability, and only solutions which fit the data within

previously qualifying dataset is almost entirely retained and with strong

new emissivities leads to a decrease in Y_p. In addition, we find a general
trend to larger uncertainties in individual objects (due to changes in the
emissivities) and an increased variance (due to additional objects included).
From a regression to zero metallicity, we determine Y_p = 0.2465 +/- 0.0097, in
good agreement with the Planck result of Y_p = 0.2485 +/- 0.0002. In the

models. For realistic values of the cross section we typically find preferred
values of $\Lambda $ on the order of $10^{-5}$ of the present value assuming
dark matter annihilations are the primary source of entropy production. The
greatest amount of entropy production from dark matter within the causal
diamond is likely to occur with light keV scale dark matter with low
annihilation cross section. We also investigate the effect of combining this
entropy with the entropy production from stars, and show that if the primary
source of entropy production is from stars, varying the dark matter cross
section directly produces a preferred value of $\Omega_m$ in excellent
agreement with observations.

validate the methodology. Measurements were carried out at temperatures between
750 $^\circ$C and 850 $^\circ$C and over a wide range of oxygen partial

ECR measurements under oxidizing conditions. A systematic data analysis
procedure was developed to permit reliable extraction of the kinetic parameters

$D_{Chem}$ from this study showed excellent qualitative and quantitative
agreement with expected values, falling in the range from $\sim 2\times10^{-5}$

most favourable properties of both high-speed dynamic random access memory
(DRAM) and non-volatile flash memory, is resistive random access memory
(ReRAM). ReRAM is based on switching back and forth from a high-resistance
state (HRS) to a low-resistance state (LRS). ReRAM cells are small, allowing
for the creation of memory on the scale of terabits. One of the most promising
materials for use as the active medium in resistive memory is hafnia (HfO$_2$).
  However, an unresolved physics is the nature of defects and traps that are
responsible for the charge transport in HRS state of resistive memory.
  In this study, we demonstrated experimentally and theoretically that oxygen
vacancies are responsible for the HRS charge transport in resistive memory
elements based on HfO$_2$. We also demonstrated that LRS transport occurs
through a mechanism described according to percolation theory.
  Based on the model of multiphonon tunneling between traps, and assuming that
the electron traps are oxygen vacancies, good quantitative agreement between
the experimental and theoretical data of current-voltage characteristics were
achieved. The thermal excitation energy of the traps in hafnia was determined
based on the excitation spectrum and luminescence of the oxygen vacancies.
  The findings of this study demonstrate that in resistive memory elements
using hafnia, the oxygen vacancies in hafnia play a key role in creating
defects in HRS charge transport.

nuclei (LLAGNs) probably have a two-component structure with an inner ADAF and
an outer truncated accretion disk. As shown by Taam et al. (2012), the
truncation radius as a function of mass accretion rate is strongly affected by
including the magnetic field within the framework of disk evaporation model,
i.e., an increase of the magnetic field results in a smaller truncation radius
of the accretion disk. In this work, we calculate the emergent spectrum of an
inner ADAF + an outer truncated accretion disk around a supermassive black hole
based on the prediction by Taam et al. (2012). It is found that an increase of
the magnetic field from $\beta=0.8$ to $\beta=0.5$ (with magnetic pressure
$p_{\rm m}=B^2/{8\pi}=(1-\beta)p_{\rm tot}$, $p_{\rm tot}=p_{\rm gas}+p_{\rm
m}$) results in an increase of $\sim 8.7$ times of the luminosity from the
truncated accretion disk. We found that the equipartition of gas pressure to
magnetic pressure, i.e., $\beta=0.5$, failed to explain the observed
anti-correlation between $L_{\rm 2-10 keV}/L_{\rm Edd}$ and the bolometric
correction $\kappa_{\rm 2-10 keV}$ (with $\kappa_{\rm 2-10 keV} = L_{\rm
bol}/L_{\rm 2-10 keV}$). The emergent spectra for larger value $\beta=0.8$ or
$\beta=0.95$ can well explain the observed $L_{\rm 2-10 keV}/L_{\rm
Edd}$-$\kappa_{\rm 2-10 keV}$ correlation. We argue that in the disk
evaporation model, the electrons in the corona are assumed to be heated only by
a transfer of energy from the ions to electrons via Coulomb collisions, which
is reasonable for the accretion with a lower mass accretion rate. Coulomb
heating is the dominated heating mechanism for the electrons only if the
magnetic field is strongly sub-equipartition, which is roughly consistent with
observations.

of the triple-merging system in NGC3341. Our panchromatic analysis confirms the
presence of a Seyfert 2 AGN in NGC3341B, one of the secondary dwarf companions.
On the other hand, the nucleus of the primary galaxy, consistent with a
star-forming region of a few solar masses per year, and NGC3341C are very
unlikely to host an AGN. We therefore suggest that NGC3341 is an exceptional
example of an AGN triggered in the satellite galaxy of a minor-merging system.
The existence of such a system can have important implications in the models of
hierarchical growth of structures. Further observational and theoretical
efforts on NGC3341 and potentially similar sources are needed in order to
understand the role of minor mergers on the onset of AGN activity, and in the
evolution of massive galaxies.

investigated via the material point method. Two typical cavity effects in the
region subjected to rarefaction wave are identified: (i) part of material
particles flow away from the cavity in comparison to the initial loading
velocity, (ii) local regions show weaker negative or even positive pressures.
Neighboring cavities interact via coalescence of isobaric contours. The growth
of cavity under tension shows staged behaviors. After the initial slow stage,
the volume and the dimensions in both the tensile and transverse directions
show linear growth rate with time until the global tensile wave arrives at the
upper free surface. It is interesting that the growth rate in the transverse
direction is faster than that in the tensile direction. The volume growth rate
linearly increases with the initial tensile velocity. After the global tensile
wave passed the cavity, both the maximum particle velocity in the tensile
direction and the maximum particle velocity in the opposite direction increase
logarithmically with the initial tensile speed. The shock wave reflected back
from the cavity and compression wave from the free surface induce the initial
behavior of interfacial instabilities such as the Richtmyer-Meshkov
instability, which is mainly responsible for the irregularity in the morphology
of deformed cavity. The local temperatures and distribution of hot spots are
determined by the plastic work. Compared with the dynamical process, the heat
conduction is much slower.

recent lattice QCD calculations of the deconfinement transition temperature at
zero baryon chemical potential. The FCM thus provides a powerful tool to link

Theoretical interpretations of such fluctuating membranes are most commonly
based on generalized Helfrich-type elastic models, with additional
contributions of local ""protrusions"" and/or density fluctuations. Such models
provide an excellent basis for describing the fluctuations of tensionless
bilayers in the fluid phase at a quantitative level.
  However, this description is found to fail for membranes in the gel phase and
for membranes subject to high tensions. The fluctuations of tilted gel
membranes show a signature of the modulated ripple structure, which is a nearby
phase observed in the pretransition regime between the fluid and tilted gel
state. This complicates a quantitative analysis on mesoscopic length scales. In
the case of fluid membranes under tension, the large-wavelength fluctuation
modes are found to be significantly softer than predicted by theory.
  In the latter context, we also address the general problem of the relation
between frame tension and the fluctuation tension, which has been discussed
somewhat controversially in recent years. Simulations of very simple model
membranes with fixed area show that the fluctuations should be controlled by
the frame tension, and not by the internal tension.

investigated in the parameter regime of interest, and the resulting turbulent
energy dissipation has not yet been quantified. We do so by performing three
dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of a small patch of a tidally deformed

the tidal deformation is weak, the nonlinear outcome of the instability leads
to the formation of long-lived columnar vortices aligned with the axis of
rotation. These vortices shut off the elliptical instability, and the net
result is insufficient energy dissipation to account for tidal dissipation.
However, further work is required to account for effects neglected here,

Here, we study whether the addition of a magnetic field prevents those vortices
from forming, and hence leads to enhanced dissipation. We present results from
magnetohydrodynamical simulations that evolve the elliptical instability in a
local patch of a rotating planet or star, in the presence of a weak magnetic
field. We find that magnetic fields do indeed prevent vortices from forming,
and hence greatly enhance the steady state dissipation rate. In addition, the
resulting turbulence acts as a small-scale dynamo, amplifying the initially
weak field. The inferred tidal dissipation is potentially important at short
orbital periods. For example, it can circularise hot Jupiters with orbital
periods shorter than 2.5 days, and synchronise their spins with their orbits
out to 6 days. However, it appears unable to account for the hot Jupiters that
appear to have been circularised out to six to ten day orbital periods. It also
cannot account for the inferred circularisation of many close binary stars.

algorithmic solution of structured smooth convex optimization problems.
Although the gradient descent method is a natural choice for this task, it
requires exact gradient computations and hence can be inefficient when the
problem size is large or the gradient is difficult to evaluate. Therefore,
there has been much interest in inexact gradient methods (IGMs), in which an
efficiently computable approximate gradient is used to perform the update in
each iteration. Currently, non-asymptotic linear convergence results for IGMs
are typically established under the assumption that the objective function is
strongly convex, which is not satisfied in many applications of interest; while
linear convergence results that do not require the strong convexity assumption
are usually asymptotic in nature. In this paper, we combine the best of these
two types of results and establish---under the standard assumption that the
gradient approximation errors decrease linearly to zero---the non-asymptotic
linear convergence of IGMs when applied to a class of structured convex
optimization problems. Such a class covers settings where the objective
function is not necessarily strongly convex and includes the least squares and
logistic regression problems. We believe that our techniques will find further
applications in the non-asymptotic convergence analysis of other first-order
methods.

  the [S i] 1082 nm line in giants","13 pages, 6 figures. Accepted for publication in A&A","Astronomy & Astrophysics, 559, A115 (2013)","10.1051/0004-6361/201322317",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context. The Galactic chemical evolution of sulphur is still under debate. At
low metallicities some studies find no correlation between [S/Fe] and [Fe/H],
others find [S/Fe] increasing towards lower metallicities, and still others
find a combination of the two. Each scenario has different implications for the
Galactic chemical evolution of sulphur.
  Aims. To contribute to the discussion on the Galactic chemical evolution of
sulphur by deriving sulphur abundances from non-LTE insensitive spectral
diagnostics in Disk and Halo stars with homogeneously determined stellar
parameters.
  Methods. We derive Teff from photometric colours, logg from stellar
isochrones and Bayesian estimation, and [Fe/H] and [S/Fe] from spectrum
synthesis. We derive [S/Fe] from the [S i] 1082 nm line in 39 mostly cool and
metal-poor giants, using 1D LTE MARCS model atmospheres to model our
high-resolution NIR spectra obtained with the VLT, NOT and Gemini South
telescopes.
  Results. We derive homogeneous stellar parameters for 29 stars. Our results
argue for a chemical evolution of sulphur that is typical for alpha-elements,
contrary to some previous studies. Our abundances are systematically higher by
about 0.1 dex in comparison to other studies that arrived at similar
conclusions using other sulphur diagnostics.
  Conclusions. We find the [S i] line to be a valuable diagnostic of sulphur
abundances in cool giants down to [Fe/H] ~ -2.3. We argue that a homogeneous
determination of stellar parameters is necessary, since the derived abundances
are sensitive to them. Our results ([S/Fe]) show reasonable agreement with
predictions of contemporary models of Galactic chemical evolution. In these
models sulphur is predominantly created in massive stars by oxygen burning, and
ejected in the ISM during Type II SNe explosions. Systematic differences with
previous studies likely fall within modelling uncertainties.

supervision of Fr\'ed\'eric Maffray. It is motivated by the desire for a better
understanding of perfect graphs. The proof of the Claude Berge's perfect graph
conjecture in 2002 by Chudnovsky, Robertson, Seymour and Thomas has shed a new
light on this field of combinatorics. But some questions are still unsettled,
particulary the existence of a combinatorial algorithm for the coloring of
perfect graphs.
  An even pair of a graph is a pair of vertices such that every path joining
them has even length. As proved by Fonlupt and Uhry, the contraction of an even
pair preserves the chromatic number, and when applied recursively may lead to
an optimal coloring. We prove a conjecture of Everett and Reed saying that this
method works for a class of perfect graphs: Artemis graphs. This yields a
coloring algorithm for Artemis graphs with complexity $O(n^2m)$.
  We give an $O(n^9)$ algorithm for the recognition of Artemis graphs. Other
recognition algorithms are also given, each of them based on subgraph detection
routines for Berge graphs. We show that these subgraph detection problems are
NP-complete when extended to general graphs.

partitioning the vertex set of G into k non-empty independent sets (that is,
into classes that span no edges of G). If E_n is the graph on n vertices with
no edges then {E_n \brace k} coincides with {n \brace k}, the ordinary Stirling
number of the second kind, and so we refer to {G \brace k} as a graph Stirling
number.
  Harper showed that the sequence of Stirling numbers of the second kind, and
thus the graph Stirling sequence of E_n, is asymptotically normal ---
essentially, as n grows, the histogram of ({E_n \brace k})_{k \geq 0}, suitably
normalized, approaches the density function of the standard normal
distribution.
  In light of Harper's result, it is natural to ask for which sequences
(G_n)_{n \geq 0} of graphs is there asymptotic normality of ({G_n \brace k})_{k

vertices, then asymptotic normality occurs, and they gave a proof under the
added condition that G_n has no more than o(\sqrt{n/\log n}) components.
  Here we settle Do and Galvin's conjecture in the affirmative, and
significantly extend it, replacing ""acyclic"" in their conjecture with
""co-chromatic with a quasi-threshold graph, and with negligible chromatic
number"". Our proof combines old work of Navon and recent work of Engbers,

probability vector $(p_0,..,p_{d-1})$ is a probability measure $\eta_{\beta,p}$
on $\mathbb R$, solution of the self-similarity relation
$\displaystyle\eta=\sum_{k=0}^{d-1}p_k\cdot\eta\circ S_k$ where
$S_k(x)=\frac{x+k}\beta$. If $\beta$ is an integer or a Pisot algebraic number
with finite R\'enyi expansion, $\eta_{\beta,p}$ is sofic and a Markov chain is
naturally associated. If $\beta=b\in\mathbb N$ and $p_0=...=p_{d-1}=\frac1d$,
the study of $\eta_{b,p}$ is close to the study of the order of growth of the
number of representations in base $b$ with digits in $\{0,1,..,d-1\}$. In the
case $b=2$ and $d=3$ it has also something to do with the metric properties of
the continued fractions.

  Localization",,,,,"cs.NI cs.CY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present \emph{SmartLoc}, a localization system to estimate the location
and the traveling distance by leveraging the lower-power inertial sensors
embedded in smartphones as a supplementary to GPS. To minimize the negative
impact of sensor noises, \emph{SmartLoc} exploits the intermittent strong GPS
signals and uses the linear regression to build a prediction model which is
based on the trace estimated from inertial sensors and the one computed from
the GPS. Furthermore, we utilize landmarks (e.g., bridge, traffic lights)
detected automatically and special driving patterns (e.g., turning, uphill, and
downhill) from inertial sensory data to improve the localization accuracy when
the GPS signal is weak. Our evaluations of \emph{SmartLoc} in the city
demonstrates its technique viability and significant localization accuracy
improvement compared with GPS and other approaches: the error is approximately
20m for 90% of time while the known mean error of GPS is 42.22m.

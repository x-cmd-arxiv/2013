In
order to build highly reliable systems out of less reliable parts, systems
introduce redundancy. In replicated systems, objects are simply copied several
times with each copy residing on a different physical device. While such an
approach is simple and direct, more elaborate approaches such as erasure coding
can achieve equivalent levels of data protection while using less redundancy.
This report examines the trade-offs in cost and performance between replicated
and erasure encoded storage systems.

cycle of security protocols, by adding automated aid for diagnosis and repair.
Our mechanism relies on existing verification tools analyzing intermediate
protocols and synthesizing potential attacks if the protocol is flawed. The
analysis of these attacks (including type flaw attacks) pinpoints the source of
the failure and controls the synthesis of appropriate patches to the protocol.
Using strand spaces, we have developed general guidelines for protocol repair,
and captured them into formal requirements on (sets of) protocol steps. For
each requirement, there is a collection of rules that transform a set of
protocol steps violating the requirement into a set conforming it. We have
implemented our mechanism into a tool, called SHRIMP. We have successfully
tested SHRIMP on numerous faulty protocols, all of which were successfully
repaired, fully automatically.

in the northern border of the east arm, at a region where the radio jet seems
to be deflected. Channel maps show blueshifts but also some redshifts at the
eastern arm and jet location which can be interpreted as originated in the
front and back walls of an outflow pushed by the radio jet, suggesting also
that the outflow is launched close to the plane of the sky. We estimate a mass
outflow rate along the east arm of 0.26 - 0.32 Msun yr^(-1) (depending on the
assumed outflow geometry), which is between one and two orders of magnitude
higher than the mass accretion rate to the active nucleus, implying that there
is mass-loading of the nuclear outflow from circumnuclear gas. The power of
this outflow is 0.06 - 0.3%Lbol. We propose a scenario in which gas has been
recently captured by Arp 102B in an interaction with Arp 102A, settling in a
disk rotating around the nucleus of Arp 102B and triggering its nuclear
activity. A nuclear jet is pushing the circumnuclear gas, giving origin to the
nuclear arms. A blueshifted emitting gas knot is observed at 300 pc south-east
from the nucleus and can be interpreted as another (more compact) outflow, with
a possible counterpart to the north-west.

distances of 1.4 to 24 light-days with height/distance (H/R) ratios of only

supporting experiential learning of science concepts. However, the growth of

needed to develop such products, particularly in specialized fields of science.
We sought to test whether interactive, educational, online software modules can
be developed effectively by students as a curriculum component of an advanced
science course. We discuss a set of fifteen such modules developed by Harvard
University graduate students to demonstrate various concepts related to
astronomy and physics. Their successful development of these modules
demonstrates that online software tools for education and outreach on
specialized topics can be produced while simultaneously fulfilling
project-based learning objectives. We describe a set of technologies suitable
for module development and present in detail four examples of modules developed
by the students. We offer recommendations for incorporating educational
software development within a graduate curriculum and conclude by discussing
the relevance of this novel approach to new online learning environments like

types: star forming galaxies (SFGs), transition type objects (TOs), Seyfert 2s

is explained by the mass of the galaxies and the importance of their bulge: the
LINERs reside in massive early-type galaxies, the Sy2s and TOs are hosted by
intermediate mass galaxies with intermediate morphological types, and the SFGs
are found in lower mass late-type spirals. Except for the Sy2s, the more
massive galaxies formed the bulk of their stars more rapidly than the less
massive ones. The Sy2s formed their stars more slowly and show presently an
excess in star formation. We have also found that the maximum in star formation
rate in the past increases with the virial mass within the aperture (VMA), the
VMA increasing from the SFGs to the TOs, to the Sy2s, culminating in the
LINERs. This correlation suggests that the bulges and the supermassive black
holes at the center of galaxies grow in parallel, in good agreement with the

possible probes to test cosmological models. Here we show how changes of the
slope of the {\it luminosity $L^*_X$ -break time $T^*_a$} correlation in GRB
afterglows, hereafter the LT correlation, affect the determination of the
cosmological parameters. With a simulated data set of 101 GRBs with a central
value of the correlation slope that differs on the intrinsic one by a $5\sigma$
factor, we find an overstimated value of the matter density parameter,
$\Omega_M$, compared to the value obtained with SNe Ia, while the Hubble
constant, $H_0$, best fit value is still compatible in 1$\sigma$ compared to
other probes. We show that this compatibility of $H_0$ is due to the large
intrinsic scatter associated with the simulated sample. Instead, if we consider
a subsample of high luminous GRBs ($HighL$), we find that both the evaluation
of $H_0$ and $\Omega_M$ are not more compatible in 1$\sigma$ and $\Omega_M$ is
underestimated by the $13\%$. However, the $HighL$ sample choice reduces
dramatically the intrinsic scatter of the correlation, thus possibly
identifying this sample as the standard canonical `GRBs' confirming previous
results presented in Dainotti et al. (2010,2011). Here, we consider the LT
correlation as an example, but this reasoning can be extended also for all
other GRB correlations. In literature so far GRB correlations are not corrected
for redshift evolution and selection biases, therefore we are not aware of
their intrinsic slopes and consequently how far the use of the observed
correlations can influence the derived `best' cosmological settings. Therefore,
we conclude that any approach that involves cosmology should take into
consideration only intrinsic correlations not the observed ones.

rods are represented as hard cylinders of diameter $D$ and length $L$, while
the cylindrical pore is infinite with diameter $W$. The interaction between the
wall and the rods is hard repulsive, and it is assumed that molecules are
parallel to the surface of the pore (planar anchoring). In very narrow pores
($D<W<2 D$), the structure is homogeneous and the system behaves as a
one-dimensional Tonks gas. For wider pores, inhomogeneous fluid structures
emerge because of the lowering of the average excluded volume due to the
wall-particle interaction. The bulk nematic-smectic A phase transition is
replaced by a transition between inhomogeneous nematic and smectic A phases.
The smectic is destabilized with respect to the nematic for decreasing pore
width; this effect becomes substantial for $W<10 D$. For $W>100 D$, results for
bulk and confined fluids agree well due to the short range effect of the wall
($\sim 3-4D$).

the usual Glauber supposition of independent nucleon-nucleon collisions. The
average number of participating nucleons and charged multiplicity in p-Pb
collisions were calculated and compared with the predictions of Glauber model
and experimental data. It was demonstrated that taking into account the energy
conservation results in the number of participating nucleons considerably lower
than in the Glauber approach. Different ways of centrality determination in pA

galactic coronae and their formation processes. In an earlier paper, we have
presented a Chandra data analysis of the coronae of 53 nearby highly-inclined
disc galaxies. Here we study the correlation of the X-ray measurements with
other galaxy properties and compare the results with those obtained for
elliptical galaxies. A good correlation is present between the coronal
luminosity Lx and the SFR. But we find a better correlation between Lx and the
total SN mechanical energy input rate (ESN), including the expected
contribution from core collapsed (CC) and Ia SNe. The X-ray radiation
efficiency (eta=Lx/ESN) has a mean value of ~0.4% with an rms of ~0.5dex. eta
further correlates with MTF/M* (MTF is the baryon mass measured from the
rotation velocity and the Tully-Fisher relation, M* is the stellar mass
measured from the K-band luminosity) and the CC SN rate surface density (FSN,
in units of SN/yr/kpc^2), which can be characterized as: eta=0.41%MTF/M* and
eta=1.4%FSN^-0.3. These correlations reflect the roles played by the
gravitational mass and energetic feedback concentrations in determining eta.
The characteristic temperature of the corona shows little dependence on the
total or specific SFR, the cold gas content, or Lx. The coronae of disc
galaxies tend to be more X-ray luminous, hotter, and lower in Fe/O abundance
ratio than those of elliptical ones of similar masses. Early-type non-starburst
disc galaxies tend to be more Fe-rich, while starburst ones have a roughly
constant abundance ratio of Fe/O~0.36solar. Our results are consistent with the
coronal gas being mainly provided by stellar feedback in a mass range of
M*~10^{8.7-11}Msun. In addition, processes such as charge exchange at cool/hot
gas interfaces, as well as various environmental effects, are also needed to
explain the diversity of coronal properties.

It describes how two deformable objects adhere together, driven by adhesion

solids. We tested JKR theory to see if solid surface tension affects
indentation behaviour. Using confocal microscopy, we characterised the
indentation of glass particles into soft, silicone substrates. While JKR theory
held for particles larger than a critical, elastocapillary lengthscale, it
failed for smaller particles. Instead, adhesion of small particles mimicked the
adsorption of particles at a fluid interface, with a size-independent contact
angle between the undeformed surface and the particle given by a generalised
version of Young's law. A simple theory quantitatively captures this behaviour,
and explains how solid surface tension dominates elasticity for small-scale
indentation of soft materials.

Describing metastasis in terms of a simple one-way migration of cells from the

cancer spread. A diaspora is the scattering of people away from an established
homeland. To date, diaspora has been a uniquely human term utilized by social
scientists, however, the application of the diaspora concept to metastasis may
yield new biological insights as well as therapeutic paradigms. The diaspora
paradigm takes into account and models several variables: the quality of the
primary tumor microenvironment, the fitness of individual cancer cell migrants
as well as migrant populations, the rate of bidirectional migration of cancer
and host cells between cancer sites, and the quality of the target
microenvironments to establish metastatic sites. Ecological scientific
principles can be applied to the cancer diaspora to develop new therapeutic
strategies. For example, ecological traps, habitats that lead to the extinction
of a species, can be developed to attract cancer cells to a place where they
can be better exposed to treatments or to cells of the immune system for
improved antigen presentation. Merging the social science concept of diaspora
with ecological and population sciences concepts can inform the cancer field to
understand the biology of tumorigenesis and metastasis and inspire new ideas

We use extensive Monte-Carlo simulations to investigate the spatial

encapsidating shell of charge density of the same sign as the charged droplet,
as well as the possibility to dispense altogether with the encapsidating shell,

generalize the problem replacing $B$ by a nonnegative measure $d M$ and
imposing on $d M$ the condition that its total mass is $<= m$. The problem is
to design for a given frequency $\alpha \in R$ a medium that generates a
resonance $ \omega $ on the line $\alpha + i R$ with a minimal possible decay
rate $| Im \omega |$. Such resonances are said to be of minimal decay and form
a Pareto frontier. We show that corresponding optimal measures consist of
finite number of point masses, and that this result yields non-existence of
optimizers for the problem over the set of absolutely continuous measures $B(x)
dx$. Then we derive restrictions on optimal point masses and their positions.
These restrictions are strong enough to calculate optimal $d M$ if the optimal
resonance $ \omega $, the first point mass $m_1$, and one more geometric
parameter are known. This reduces the original infinitely-dimensional problem
to optimization over four real parameters. For small frequencies, we explicitly
find the Pareto set and the corresponding optimal measures $d M$. The technique

may both reduce soil stiffness and increase the energy dissipation into the
soil. To investigate seismic wave amplification in such cases, past studies
have been devoted to one-directional shear wave propagation in a soil column
(1D-propagation) considering one motion component only (1C-polarization). Three
independent purely 1C computations may be performed ('1D-1C' approach) and
directly superimposed in the case of weak motions (linear behaviour). This
research aims at studying local site effects by considering seismic wave
propagation in a 1-D soil profile accounting for the influence of the 3-D
loading path and non-linear hysteretic behaviour of the soil. In the proposed
'1D-3C' approach, the three components (3C-polarization) of the incident wave
are simultaneously propagated into a horizontal multilayered soil. A 3-D
non-linear constitutive relation for the soil is implemented in the framework
of the Finite Element Method in the time domain. The complex rheology of soils
is modelled by mean of a multisurface cyclic plasticity model of the
Masing-Prandtl-Ishlinskii-Iwan type. The great advantage of this choice is that
the only data needed to describe the model is the modulus reduction curve. A
parametric study is carried out to characterize the changes in the seismic
motion of the surficial layers due to both incident wavefield properties and
soil non-linearities. The numerical simulations show a seismic response
depending on several parameters such as polarization of seismic waves, material
elastic and dynamic properties, as well as on the impedance contrast between
layers and frequency content and oscillatory character of the input motion. The
3-D loading path due to the 3C-polarization leads to multi-axial stress
interaction that reduces soil strength and increases non-linear effects. The
non-linear behaviour of the soil may have beneficial or detrimental effects on
the seismic response at the free surface, depending on the energy dissipation
rate. Free surface time histories, stress-strain hysteresis loops and in-depth
profiles of octahedral stress and strain are estimated for each soil column.
The combination of three separate 1D-1C non-linear analyses is compared to the
proposed 1D-3C approach, evidencing the influence of the 3C-polarization and
the 3-D loading path on strong seismic motions.

including Compton thick population may explain the cosmic hard X-ray
background. At MeV energy range, Seyferts having non-thermal electrons in
coronae above accretion disks or MeV blazars may explain the background
radiation. We propose that future measurements of the angular power spectra of
anisotropy of the cosmic X-ray and MeV gamma-ray backgrounds will be key to
deciphering these backgrounds and the evolution of active galactic nuclei
(AGNs). As AGNs trace the cosmic large-scale structure, spatial clustering of
AGNs exists. We show that e-ROSITA will clearly detect the correlation signal
of unresolved Seyferts at 0.5-2 keV and 2-10 keV bands and will be able to
measure the bias parameter of AGNs at both bands. Once the future hard X-ray
all sky satellites achieve the sensitivity better than 10^{-12} erg/cm^2/s at
10-30 keV or 30-50 keV - although this is beyond the sensitivities of current
hard X-ray all sky monitors - angular power spectra will allow us to
independently investigate the fraction of Compton-thick AGNs in all Seyferts.
We also find that the expected angular power spectra of Seyferts and blazars in
the MeV range are different by about an order of magnitude, where the Poisson
term, so-called shot noise, is dominant. Current and future MeV instruments
will clearly disentangle the origin of the MeV gamma-ray background through the
angular power spectrum.

not sufficient to robustly distinguish spectral distortions due to the resonant

(>100 Angstroms) and LyA luminosity (~10^43 erg/s). At 120 km/s (FWHM) spectral
resolution, the prominent double-peaked LyA profile straddles the systemic
velocity, where the velocity zero-point is determined from spectroscopy of the
galaxies' rest-frame optical nebular emission lines. The average velocity
offset from systemic of the stronger redshifted emission component for our
sample is 176 km/s while the average total separation between the redshifted
and main blueshifted emission components is 380 km/s. These measurements are a
factor of ~2 smaller than for UV continuum-selected galaxies that show LyA in
emission with lower LyA equivalent width. We compare our LyA spectra to the
predicted line profiles of a spherical ""expanding shell"" LyA radiative transfer
grid that models large-scale galaxy outflows. Specifically blueward of the
systemic velocity where two galaxies show a weak, highly blueshifted (by ~1000
km/s) tertiary emission peak, the model line profiles are a relatively poor
representation of the observed spectra. Since the neutral gas column density
has a dominant influence over the shape of the LyA line profile, we caution
against equating the observed LyA velocity offset with a physical outflow
velocity, especially at lower spectral resolution where the unresolved LyA
velocity offset is a convoluted function of several degenerate parameters.
Referring to rest-frame ultraviolet and optical Hubble Space Telescope imaging,
we find that galaxy-galaxy interactions may play an important role in inducing
a starburst that results in copious LyA emission, as well as perturbing the gas
distribution and velocity field which have strong influence over the LyA
emission line profile.

I_814=29 with >90% completeness and sample the brightest ~5% of the GC system.
Assuming the well-known Gaussian form of the GC luminosity function (GCLF), we
estimate a total population of N(GC_total) = 162,850 GCs within a projected
radius of 400kpc. As many as half may comprise an intracluster component. Even
with the sizable uncertainties, which mainly result from the uncertain GCLF
parameters, this is by far the largest GC system studied to date. The specific
frequency S_N is high, but not uncommon for central galaxies in massive
clusters, rising from S_N~5 near the center to ~12 at large radii. Passive
galaxy fading would increase S_N by ~20% at z=0. We construct the radial mass
profiles of the GCs, stars, intracluster gas, and lensing-derived total mass,
and we compare the mass fractions as a function of radius. The estimated mass
in GCs, M(GC_total)=3.9x10^10 Msun, is comparable to ~80% of the total stellar
mass of the Milky Way. The shape of the GC mass profile appears intermediate
between those of the stellar light and total cluster mass. Despite the extreme
nature of this system, the ratios of the GC mass to the baryonic and total
masses, and thus the GC formation efficiency, are typical of those in other
rich clusters when comparing at the same physical radii. The GC formation
efficiency is not constant, but varies with radius, in a manner that appears
similar for different clusters; we speculate on the reasons for this similarity

of circumstantial evidence implies that many of these discs are warped. The
standard Bardeen--Petterson model attributes the shape of the warp to the
competition between Lense--Thirring torque from the central black hole and
viscous angular-momentum transport within the disc. We show that this
description is incomplete, and that torques from the companion star (for X-ray
binaries) or the self-gravity of the disc (for active galactic nuclei) can play
a major role in determining the properties of the warped disc. Including these
effects leads to a rich set of new phenomena. For example, (i) when a companion
star is present and the warp arises from a misalignment between the companion's
orbital axis and the black hole's spin axis, there is no steady-state solution
of the Pringle--Ogilvie equations for a thin warped disc when the viscosity
falls below a critical value; (ii) in AGN accretion discs, the warp can excite
short-wavelength bending waves that propagate inward with growing amplitude
until they are damped by the disc viscosity. We show that both phenomena can
occur for plausible values of the black hole and disc parameters, and briefly
discuss their observational implications.

uncertainty in a mixed quantum state is used to improve existing uncertainty
relations and how this information affects one's ability to witness
EPR-steering. As an example, we consider the recent improvement (using a
quantum memory) to the entropic uncertainty relation between pairs of discrete
observables (Nat. Phys. 6, 659 (2010)) and show that a trivial substitution of
the tighter bound in the steering inequality leads to contradictions, due in

trees for peer-to-peer streaming in a flow level model. It is assumed that
videos are cut into substreams, with or without source coding, to be
distributed to all nodes. The algorithm guarantees that each node receives
sufficiently many substreams within delay logarithmic in the number of peers.
The algorithm works by constantly updating the topology so that each substream
is distributed through trees to as many nodes as possible without interference.
Competition among trees for limited upload capacity is managed so that both
coverage and balance are achieved. The algorithm is robust in that it
efficiently eliminates cycles and maintains tree structures in a distributed
way. The algorithm favors nodes with higher degree, so it not only works for
live streaming and video on demand, but also in the case a few nodes with large
degree act as servers and other nodes act as clients.
  A proof of convergence of the algorithm is given assuming instantaneous
update of depth information, and for the case of a single tree it is shown that
the convergence time is stochastically tightly bounded by a small constant
times the log of the number of nodes. These theoretical results are
complemented by simulations showing that the algorithm works well even when
most assumptions for the theoretical tractability do not hold.

is possible to achieve the interesting situation where the topological edge
modes are unstable while all bulk modes are stable. Thus, after the initial
preparation, the edge modes will become rapidly populated. We illustrate this
with the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model which can be realized with a double-well
optical lattice and is perhaps the simplest model with topological edge states.

Protein contact map describes the pairwise spatial and functional
relationship of residues in a protein and contains key information for protein
3D structure prediction. Although studied extensively, it remains very
challenging to predict contact map using only sequence information. Most
existing methods predict the contact map matrix element-by-element, ignoring
correlation among contacts and physical feasibility of the whole contact map. A
couple of recent methods predict contact map based upon residue co-evolution,
taking into consideration contact correlation and enforcing a sparsity
restraint, but these methods require a very large number of sequence homologs
for the protein under consideration and the resultant contact map may be still
physically unfavorable.
  Results. This paper presents a novel method PhyCMAP for contact map
prediction, integrating both evolutionary and physical restraints by machine
learning and integer linear programming (ILP). The evolutionary restraints
include sequence profile, residue co-evolution and context-specific statistical
potential. The physical restraints specify more concrete relationship among
contacts than the sparsity restraint. As such, our method greatly reduces the
solution space of the contact map matrix and thus, significantly improves
prediction accuracy. Experimental results confirm that PhyCMAP outperforms
currently popular methods no matter how many sequence homologs are available
for the protein under consideration. PhyCMAP can predict contacts within
minutes after PSIBLAST search for sequence homologs is done, much faster than
the two recent methods PSICOV and EvFold.

  Practical Applications",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Over the last decade, a number of Computational Imaging (CI) systems have
been proposed for tasks such as motion deblurring, defocus deblurring and
multispectral imaging. These techniques increase the amount of light reaching
the sensor via multiplexing and then undo the deleterious effects of
multiplexing by appropriate reconstruction algorithms. Given the widespread
appeal and the considerable enthusiasm generated by these techniques, a
detailed performance analysis of the benefits conferred by this approach is
important.
  Unfortunately, a detailed analysis of CI has proven to be a challenging
problem because performance depends equally on three components: (1) the
optical multiplexing, (2) the noise characteristics of the sensor, and (3) the
reconstruction algorithm. A few recent papers have performed analysis taking
multiplexing and noise characteristics into account. However, analysis of CI
systems under state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms, most of which exploit
signal prior models, has proven to be unwieldy. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive analysis framework incorporating all three components.
  In order to perform this analysis, we model the signal priors using a
Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). A GMM prior confers two unique characteristics.
Firstly, GMM satisfies the universal approximation property which says that any
prior density function can be approximated to any fidelity using a GMM with
appropriate number of mixtures. Secondly, a GMM prior lends itself to
analytical tractability allowing us to derive simple expressions for the
`minimum mean square error' (MMSE), which we use as a metric to characterize
the performance of CI systems. We use our framework to analyze several
previously proposed CI techniques, giving conclusive answer to the question:
`How much performance gain is due to use of a signal prior and how much is due
to multiplexing?

dynamics at the centers of galactic bulges using data of the highest possible
spatial resolution. Consequently, we present here an atlas of galaxies in the

budding yeast and fission yeast. No association between cell-cycle regulated

show that in budding yeast, fission yeast, and human, the genes most highly

replicate late. Transcription during other cell-cycle phases shows either the
opposite correlation with replication timing, or no relation. The relationship
is strongest near late-firing origins of replication, which is not consistent
with a previously proposed model -- that replication timing may affect
transcription -- and instead suggests a potential mechanism involving the
recruitment of limiting replication initiation factors during S-phase. These
results suggest that S-phase transcription may be an important determinant of

orbit at relatively large separations. Both moons have significant
eccentricities and inclinations, in a pattern that is consistent with a past
orbital resonance (Ragozzine and Brown, 2009). Based on our analysis, we find
that the present system is not consistent with satellite formation close to the
primary and tidal evolution though mean-motion resonances. We propose that
Namaka experienced only limited tidal evolution, leading to the mutual 8:3
mean-motion resonance which redistributed eccentricities and inclinations
between the moons. This scenario requires that the original orbit of Hi'iaka
was mildly eccentric; we propose that this eccentricity was either primordial
or acquired though encounters with other TNOs. Both dynamical stability and our
preferred tidal evolution model imply that the moons' masses are only about one
half of previously estimated values, suggesting high albedos and low densities.
As the present orbits of the moons strongly suggest formation from a flat disk
close to their present locations, we conclude that Hi'iaka and Namaka may be
second-generation moons, formed after the breakup of a past large moon,
previously proposed as the parent body of the Haumea family (Schlichting and
Sari, 2009). We derive plausible parameters of that moon, consistent with the
current models of Haumea's formation (Leinhardt et al, 2010). An interesting
implication of this hypothesis is that Hi'iaka and Namaka may orbit retrograde
with respect to Haumea's spin. Retrograde orbits of Haumea's moons would be in
full agreement with available observations and our dynamical analysis, and
could provide a unique confirmation the ""disrupted satellite"" scenario for the

to be fractional. Dramatic changes in the electron density from full
configuration interaction are observed in real space illustrating key
intricacies of electronic structure including the transfer, hopping and removal
of electrons. Physically, this is due to the particle nature of electrons and
manifests itself theoretically as a diverging linear density response function
or an energy derivative discontinuity that occurs at constant number of
electrons. This is essential to correctly describe real physical processes,
from chemical reactions to electron transport and metal-insulator transitions.
The dramatic errors of DFT are seen in real space as this physics is missing
from currently used approximations and poses a great challenge for the
development of new electronic structure methods.

is calculated to be zero owing to the spin-orbit coupling induced time-reversal
invariance. Furthermore, a new collective mode in the spin-1 excitation
spectrum is predicted to localize at zero momentum transfer in the HO state
which can be visualized, for example, by electron spin resonance (ESR) at zero
magnetic field or polarized inelastic neutron scattering measurements. The
results demonstrate that the concomitant broken and invariant symmetries
protected SODW order not only provides insights into numerous nontrivial
hidden-order phenomena, but also offers a parallel laboratory to the formation
of a topologically protected quantum state beyond the quantum spin-Hall state

flow networks governed by monotone distributed routing policies. The networks
are modeled as systems of ODEs based on mass conversation laws on directed
graphs with limited flow capacities on the links and constant external inflows
at certain origin nodes. Under monotonicity assumptions on the routing
policies, it is proven that a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium exists
so that the network achieves maximal throughput, provided that no cut capacity
constraint is violated by the external inflows. On the contrary, should such a
constraint be violated, the network overload behavior is characterized. In
particular, it is established that there exists a cut with respect to which the
flow densities on every link grow linearly over time (resp. reach their
respective limits simultaneously) in the case where the buffer capacities are
infinite (resp. finite). The results employ an $l_1$-contraction principle for

experimentally measured dipole moments for the triad of ~110 Debye (D) and ~160

energy re-ordering for the tetra-sulfonated ZnPc system leads to local
excitations lying lower in energy than the CT state, displaying a possible
deactivation pathway obstructing charge separation. Since several different
donor-acceptor relative orientations may co-exist at an organic heterojunction,
we compare the energetics of a few low-lying CT states for the end-on geometry
of a di-sulfonated system to its co-facial orientation counterpart. The
calculated CT excitation energies are larger for the end-on orientation in
comparison to the co-facial structure by ~1.5 eV, which results principally
from a substantial decrease in exciton binding energy in going from the
co-facial to the end-on orientation. Furthermore, changes in relative
donor-acceptor orientation have a larger impact on the CT energies than changes
in donor-acceptor distance. TDDFT calculations on the various sulfonated ZnPc
donor molecules show a significant splitting of the Q-band for only one of the
four donor systems. Our present calculations, in line with previous

groups is a promising avenue for the substituent-level tuning of various
physical properties of organic semiconductors.

recovery and offer high capacity efficiency. Diversity coding is the first
technique to incorporate coding in this field and is easy to implement over
small arbitrary networks. However, its capacity efficiency is restricted by its
systematic coding and high design complexity even though its design complexity
is lower than the other coding-based recovery techniques. Alternative
techniques mitigate some of these limitations, but they are difficult to
implement over arbitrary networks. In this paper, we propose a simple column
generation-based design algorithm and a novel advanced diversity coding
technique to achieve near-hitless recovery over arbitrary networks. The design
framework consists of two parts: a main problem and subproblem. Main problem is
realized with Linear Programming (LP) and Integer Linear Programming (ILP),
whereas the subproblem can be realized with different methods. The simulation
results suggest that both the novel coding structure and the novel design
algorithm lead to higher capacity efficiency for near-hitless recovery. The
novel design algorithm simplifies the capacity placement problem which enables
implementing diversity coding-based techniques on very large arbitrary

structure and heterozygous rate. By introducing novel techniques of k-mer
individuals, float precision estimation, and proper treatment of sequencing
error and coverage bias, the estimation accuracy of our method is significantly
improved over existing methods. We also studied how the various genomic and
sequencing characteristics affect the estimation accuracy using simulated
sequencing data, and discussed the limitations on applying our method to real
sequencing data. Conclusion: Based on this research, we show that the k-mer
frequency analysis can be used as a general and assembly-independent method for
estimating genomic characteristics, which can improve our understanding of a
species genome, help design the sequencing strategy of genome projects, and
guide the development of assembly algorithms. The programs developed in this

two qualitatively distinct final states, one having several isolated connected

of opinions and the other having one single dominant connected component with
each node within it having the same opinion. Furthermore, and more importantly,
we found that the initial clustering in network can also induce similar

in serious problems for applications at liquid nitrogen (and higher)

strong fluctuations of the order parameter, thermally-activated hopping of
pinned vortices and electromagnetic granularity, as has been established after

puzzling observations of the high redshift galaxy population. We begin by
pointing out that the observed specific star formation rate requires a
duty-cycle of ~10%, which is much lower than found in many hydro-dynamical
simulations. This value follows directly from the fact that the observed star
formation rate in galaxies integrated over a Hubble time exceeds the observed
stellar mass by an order of magnitude. We use the large observed specific star
formation rate to calibrate the efficiency of feedback in a model for the high
redshift star formation rate which includes merger driven star formation
regulated by SNe feedback. This model reproduces the star formation rate
density function and the stellar mass function of galaxies at 4<z<7. A
prediction of the model is that the specific star formation rate does not
evolve very rapidly with either mass or redshift, in agreement with
observation. This is in contrast to results from hydrodynamical simulations
where the star formation closely follows the accretion rate, and so increases
strongly towards high redshift. The bursty star formation model naturally
explains the observation that there is not enough stellar mass at z~2-4 to
account for all of the star-formation observed, without invoking properties
like an evolving initial mass function of stars. The finding of a duty cycle
that is ~10% implies that there should be ten times the number of known
galaxies at fixed stellar mass that have not yet been detected through standard
UV selection at high redshift. We therefore predict the existence of a large
undetected population of UV-faint galaxies that accounts for most of the
stellar mass density at z~4-8.

are not only of fundamental importance, but also building blocks for
fault-tolerant quantum computation. Although certain experimental breakthroughs
for observing Majorana fermions have been made recently, their conclusive
dection is still challenging due to the lack of proper material properties of
the underlined experimental systems. Here we propose a new platform for
Majorana fermions based on edge states of certain non-topological
two-dimensional semiconductors with strong spin-orbit coupling, such as
monolayer group-VI transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD). Using
first-principles calculations and tight-binding modeling, we show that zigzag
edges of monolayer TMD can host well isolated single edge band with strong
spin-orbit coupling energy. Combining with proximity induced s-wave
superconductivity and in-plane magnetic fields, the zigzag edge supports robust
topological Majorana bound states at the edge ends, although the
two-dimensional bulk itself is non-topological. Our findings points to a
controllable and integrable platform for searching and manipulating Majorana
fermions.

standard Markov chain Monte Carlo methods used for inference. However, the
error in approximating the infinite-dimensional posterior can be hard to

which allows the level of the truncation to be decided by the algorithm and so
can avoid large errors in approximating the posterior. A sequence of truncated

L1551 NE in the C18O (3--2) line with the SMA in its compact and subcompact
configurations. Our previous observations at a higher angular resolution in the
extended configuration revealed a circumbinary disk exhibiting Keplerian
motion. The combined data having more extensive spatial coverage (~140 - 2000
AU) verify the presence of a Keplerian circumbinary disk, and reveals for the
first time a distinct low-velocity (~< +-0.5 km s-1 from the systemic velocity)
component that displays a velocity gradient along the minor axis of the
circumbinary disk. Our simple model that reproduces the main features seen in
the Position-Velocity diagrams comprises a circumbinary disk exhibiting
Keplerian motion out to a radius of ~300 AU, beyond which the gas exhibits pure
infall at a constant velocity of ~0.6 km s-1. The latter is significantly
smaller than the expected free-fall velocity of ~2.2 km s-1 onto the L1551 NE
protostellar mass of ~0.8 Msun at ~300 AU, suggesting that the infalling gas is
decelerated as it moves into regions of high gas pressure in the circumbinary
disk. The discontinuity in angular momenta between the outer infalling gas and
inner Keplerian circumbinary disk implies an abrupt transition in the
effectiveness at which magnetic braking is able to transfer angular momentum
outwards, a result perhaps of the different plasma beta and ionization
fractions between the outer and inner regions of the circumbinary disk.

the disk stars of a disk galaxy simulated in a fully cosmological setting with
the chemodynamical galaxy evolution code, GCD+. We study how the radial
abundance gradients vary as a function of height above the plane and find that
the metallicity ([alpha/Fe]) gradient becomes more positive (negative) with
increasing height, changing sign around 1.5 kpc above the plane. At the largest
vertical height (2 < |z| < 3 kpc), our simulated galaxy shows a positive radial
metallicity gradient. We find that the positive metallicity gradient is caused
by the age-metallicity and age-velocity dispersion relation, where the younger
stars have higher metallicity and lower velocity dispersion. Due to the
age-velocity dispersion relation, a greater fraction of younger stars reach |z|
> 2 kpc at the outer region, because of the lower gravitational restoring force
of the disk, i.e. flaring. As a result, the fraction of younger stars with
higher metallicity due to the age-metallicity relation becomes higher at the
outer radii, which makes the median metallicity higher at the outer radii.
Combining this result with the recently observed age-metallicity and
age-velocity dispersion relation for the Milky Way thick disk stars suggested
by Haywood et al. (2013), we argue that the observed (small) positive radial
metallicity gradient at large heights of the Milky Way disk stars can be
explained by the flaring of the younger thick and/or thin disk stars.

hydrogen-rich DA white dwarfs with very low metallicity progenitors
($Z=0.0001$). These cooling sequences are appropriate for the study of very old
stellar populations. The results presented here are the product of
self-consistent, fully evolutionary calculations. Specifically, we follow the
evolution of white dwarf progenitors from the zero-age main sequence through
all the evolutionary phases, namely the core hydrogen-burning phase, the
helium-burning phase, and the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch phase
to the white dwarf stage. This is done for the most relevant range of main
sequence masses, covering the most usual interval of white dwarf masses ---
from $0.53\, M_{\sun}$ to $0.83\, M_{\sun}$. Due to the low metallicity of the
progenitor stars, white dwarfs are born with thicker hydrogen envelopes,
leading to more intense hydrogen burning shells as compared with their solar
metallicity counterparts. We study the phase in which nuclear reactions are
still important and find that nuclear energy sources play a key role during
long periods of time, considerably increasing the cooling times from those
predicted by standard white dwarf models. In particular, we find that for this
metallicity and for white dwarf masses smaller than about $0.6\, M_{\sun}$,
nuclear reactions are the main contributor to the stellar luminosity for
luminosities as low as $\log(L/L_{\sun})\simeq -3.2$. This, in turn, should
have a noticeable impact in the white dwarf luminosity function of
low-metallicity stellar populations.

equation is employed to simulate the temperature field. The effect of the
porous media is considered by introducing the porosity into the equilibrium
moments, and adding a forcing term to the MRT-LB equation of the flow field in
the moment space. The present MRT-LB model is validated by numerical
simulations of several 2D convection problems in porous media. The numerical
results are in good agreement with the well-documented data reported in the
literature.

quarks, including up, down and strange quarks, plus the leptons necessary to
ensure charge neutrality and \beta-equilibrium. This possibility arises because
a phase transition from hadronic to quark phase is possible at densities
present in the interior of neutron stars. It has been argued that strange
matter is the true ground state of all matter. If this is the case, as soon as
the core of the star converts to the quark phase, the entire star converts. SM

KASCADE-Grande is optimized for cosmic ray measurements in the energy range 10
PeV to 1000 PeV, thereby enabling the verification of a knee in the iron

correction factors for He. With these improvements we used our updated
empirical method to derive the 4He abundances and to test corrections for
several systematic effects in a sample of 1610 spectra of low-metallicity
extragalactic HII regions, the largest sample used so far. From this sample we
extracted a subsample of 111 HII regions with Hbeta equivalent width EW(Hbeta)

and the recognition of Cartesian graph bundles with a triangle free basis.
  A special case of $\R$ is the relation $\delta^\ast$, whose convex closure
yields the product relation $\sigma$ that induces the prime factor
decomposition of connected graphs with respect to the Cartesian product. For
the construction of $\R$ so-called Partial Star Products are of particular
interest. Several special data structures are used that allow to compute
Partial Star Products in constant time. These computations are tuned to the
recognition of approximate graph products, but also lead to a linear time
algorithm for the computation of $\delta^\ast$ for graphs with maximum bounded
degree.
  Furthermore, we define \emph{quasi Cartesian products} as graphs with
non-trivial $\delta^\ast$. We provide several examples, and show that quasi
Cartesian products can be recognized in linear time for graphs with bounded
maximum degree. Finally, we note that quasi products can be recognized in
sublinear time with a parallelized algorithm.

(LBVs), B[e] Supergiants (B[e]SGs), and Yellow Hypergiants (YHGs), are not well
understood, and yet crucial steps in determining accurate stellar and galactic
evolution models. The circumstellar environments of these stars reveal their
mass-loss history, identifying clues to both their individual evolutionary
status and the connection between objects of different phases. Here we present
a survey of 25 such evolved massive stars (16 B[e]SGs, 6 LBVs, 2 YHGs, and 1
Peculiar Oe star), observed in the K-band with the Spectrograph for INtegral
Field Observation in the Near-Infrared (SINFONI; R = 4500) on the ESO VLT UT4 8
m telescope. The sample can be split into two categories based on spectral
morphology: one group includes all of the B[e]SGs, the Peculiar Oe star, and
two of the LBVs, while the other includes the YHGs and the rest of the LBVs.
The difference in LBV spectral appearance is due to some objects being in a
quiescent phase and some objects being in an active or outburst phase. CO
emission features are found in 13 of our targets, with first time detections
for MWC 137, LHA 120-S 35, and LHA 115-S 65. From model fits to the CO band
heads, the emitting regions appear to be detached from the stellar surface.
Each star with ^12CO features also shows ^13CO emission, signaling an evolved
nature. Based on the level of ^13C enrichment, we conclude that many of the
B[e]SGs are likely in a pre-Red Supergiant phase of their evolution. There
appears to be a lower luminosity limit of log L/L_solar = 5.0 below which CO is
not detected. The lack of CO features in several high luminosity B[e]SGs and
variability in others suggests that they may in fact be LBV candidates,
strengthening the connection between these two very similar transition phases.

nuclear collisions at RHIC and LHC. Fluctuating initial density profiles are
evolved with event-by-event viscous hydrodynamics. Momentum spectra of thermal
photons radiated by these explosively expanding fireballs and their
$p_T$-differential anisotropic flow coefficients $v_n(p_T)$ are computed, both
with and without accounting for viscous corrections to the standard thermal
emission rates. Viscous corrections to the rates are found to have a larger
effect on the $v_n$ coefficients than the viscous suppression of hydrodynamic
flow anisotropies. The benefits of taking the ratio of elliptic to triangular
flow, $v_2/v_3$, are discussed, and the spacetime regions which contribute
dominantly to the photon flow harmonics are identified. The directed flow $v_1$
of thermal photons is predicted for RHIC and LHC energies.

the energy dependence of the transport have been identified: the misorientation

In case of an ordered GB made of a periodic repetition of pentagon-heptagon

determined by the misorientation angle, but the transport around the Fermi
energy is correlated with the electronic structure of the GB. A particular line

show a reduced transport for the disordered GBs, primarily attributed to

the increase of area in each cycle coincides with the increase in the

profiles have enabled epigenome-wide association studies to identify specific
CpG sites associated with a phenotype. Computational prediction of CpG
site-specific methylation levels is important, but current approaches tackle
average methylation within a genomic locus and are often limited to specific
genomic regions. Results: We characterize genome-wide DNA methylation patterns,
and show that correlation among CpG sites decays rapidly, making predictions
solely based on neighboring sites challenging. We built a random forest
classifier to predict CpG site methylation levels using as features neighboring
CpG site methylation levels and genomic distance, and co-localization with
coding regions, CGIs, and regulatory elements from the ENCODE project, among
others. Our approach achieves 91% -- 94% prediction accuracy of genome-wide
methylation levels at single CpG site precision. The accuracy increases to 98%
when restricted to CpG sites within CGIs. Our classifier outperforms
state-of-the-art methylation classifiers and identifies features that
contribute to prediction accuracy: neighboring CpG site methylation status, CpG
island status, co-localized DNase I hypersensitive sites, and specific
transcription factor binding sites were found to be most predictive of
methylation levels. Conclusions: Our observations of DNA methylation patterns
led us to develop a classifier to predict site-specific methylation levels that
achieves the best DNA methylation predictive accuracy to date. Furthermore, our
method identified genomic features that interact with DNA methylation,
elucidating mechanisms involved in DNA methylation modification and regulation,
and linking different epigenetic processes.

  Meeting 2013, to be published in BMC Bioinformatics",,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The role of epistatic interactions among loci is a central question in
evolutionary biology and is increasingly relevant in the genomic age. While the
population genetics of compensatory substitution have received considerable
attention, most studies have focused on the case when natural selection is very
strong against deleterious intermediates. In the biologically-plausible
scenario of weak to moderate selection there exist two alternate pathways for
compensatory substitution. In one pathway, a deleterious mutation becomes fixed
prior to occurrence of the compensatory mutation. In the other, the two loci
are simultaneously polymorphic. The rates of compensatory substitution along
these two pathways and their relative probabilities are functions of the
population size, selection strength, mutation rate, and recombination rate. In
this paper these rates and path probabilities are derived analytically and
verified using population genetic simulations. The expected time durations of
these two paths are similar when selection is moderate, but not when selection
is weak. The effect of recombination on the dynamics of the substitution
process are explored using simulation. Using the derived rates, a phylogenetic
substitution model of the compensatory evolution process is presented that
could be used for inference of population genetic parameters from interspecific
data.

the past decade suggest the star is undergoing a rapid drop in surface
temperature of $\approx$ $2-5.5\%$. One explanation suggests the rapid cooling
is triggered by the onset of neutron superfluidity in the core of the star,
causing enhanced neutrino emission from neutron Cooper pair breaking and
formation (PBF). Using consistent neutron star crust and core equations of
state (EOSs) and compositions, we explore the sensitivity of this
interpretation to the density dependence of the symmetry energy $L$ of the EOS
used, and to the presence of enhanced neutrino cooling in the bubble phases of
crustal ""nuclear pasta"". Modeling cooling over a conservative range of neutron
star masses and envelope compositions, we find $L\lesssim70$ MeV, competitive
with terrestrial experimental constraints and other astrophysical observations.
For masses near the most likely mass of $M\gtrsim 1.65 M_{\odot}$, the
constraint becomes more restrictive $35\lesssim L\lesssim 55$ MeV. The
inclusion of the bubble cooling processes decreases the cooling rate of the
star during the PBF phase, matching the observed rate only when $L\lesssim45$
MeV, taking all masses into consideration, corresponding to neutron star radii
$\lesssim 11$km.

the fractional telegraph process whose space-dependent distribution solves a
non-homogeneous fractional Klein-Gordon equation. The distribution of the
fractional telegraph process for $\alpha = 1$ coincides with that of the
classical telegraph process and its driving equation converts into the
homogeneous Klein-Gordon equation. Fractional planar random motions at finite
velocity are also investigated, the corresponding distributions obtained as
well as the explicit form of the governing equations. Fractionality is
reflected into the underlying random motion because in each time interval a
binomial number of deviations $B(n,\alpha)$ (with uniformly-distributed
orientation) are considered. The parameter $n$ of $B(n,\alpha)$ is itself a
random variable with fractional Poisson distribution, so that fractionality
acts as a subsampling of the changes of directions. Finally the behaviour of
each coordinate of the planar motion is examined and the corresponding
densities obtained. Extensions to $N$-dimensional fractional random flights are
envisaged as well as the fractional counterpart of the Euler-Poisson-Darboux

paper, we try to provide a mathematically sound survey of the most important

approach to establish whether they are actually doing what they have been

centrality measure should exhibit.
  Surprisingly, only a new simple measure based on distances, harmonic
centrality, turns out to satisfy all axioms; essentially, harmonic centrality
is a correction to Bavelas's classic closeness centrality designed to take
unreachable nodes into account in a natural way.
  As a sanity check, we examine in turn each measure under the lens of
information retrieval, leveraging state-of-the-art knowledge in the discipline
to measure the effectiveness of the various indices in locating web pages that
are relevant to a query. While there are some examples of this comparisons in
the literature, here for the first time we take into consideration centrality
measures based on distances, such as closeness, in an information-retrieval
setting. The results match closely the data we gathered using our axiomatic
approach.
  Our results suggest that centrality measures based on distances, which have
been neglected in information retrieval in favour of spectral centrality
measures in the last years, are actually of very high quality; moreover,
harmonic centrality pops up as an excellent general-purpose centrality index
for arbitrary directed graphs.

task requires an all-pairs shortest-path computation in the exact case, or a

Kahler potential on the quantum Kahler moduli space of Calabi-Yau n-folds, for

perturbative corrections provides an important ingredient needed to analyze the
full structure of this Kahler potential, including nonperturbative corrections
such as the Gromov-Witten invariants of the Calabi-Yau n-folds. We argue that
the perturbative corrections take a universal form, and we find that this form
is encapsulated in a specific additive characteristic class of the Calabi-Yau
n-fold which we call the log Gamma class, and which arises naturally in a
generalization of Mukai's modified Chern character map. Our proposal is
inspired heavily by the recent observation of an equality between the partition
function of certain supersymmetric, two-dimensional gauge theories on a
two-sphere, and the aforementioned Kahler potential. We further strengthen our
proposal by comparing our findings on the quantum Kahler moduli space to the
complex structure moduli space of the corresponding mirror Calabi-Yau geometry.

  Operator, Quadratic Forms and Symmetry","PhD Thesis",,,,"math-ph math.FA math.MP math.NA math.SP quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The main objective of this dissertation is to analyse thoroughly the
construction of self-adjoint extensions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator
defined on a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary and the role that
quadratic forms play to describe them. Moreover, we want to emphasise the role
that quadratic forms can play in the description of quantum systems. A
characterisation of the self-adjoint extensions of the Laplace-Beltrami
operator in terms of unitary operators acting on the Hilbert space at the
boundary is given. Using this description we are able to characterise a wide
class of self-adjoint extensions that go beyond the usual ones, i.e. Dirichlet,
Neumann, Robin,.. and that are semi-bounded below. A numerical scheme to
compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors in any dimension is proposed and its
convergence is proved. The role of invariance under the action of symmetry
groups is analysed in the general context of the theory of self-adjoint
extensions of symmetric operators and in the context of closed quadratic forms.
The self-adjoint extensions possessing the same invariance than the symmetric
operator that they extend are characterised in the most abstract setting. The
case of the Laplace-Beltrami operator is analysed also in this case. Finally, a
way to generalise Kato's representation theorem for not semi-bounded, closed
quadratic forms is proposed.

holes), we study Hawking radiation in the presence of a modified dispersion
relation which becomes super-luminal at large wave-numbers. In the usual
stationary coordinates $(t,x)$, one can describe the asymptotic evolution of
the wave-packets in WKB, but this WKB approximation breaks down in the vicinity
of the horizon, thereby allowing for a mixing between initial and final
creation and annihilation operators. Thus, one might be tempted to identify
this point where WKB breaks down with the moment of particle creation. However,
using different coordinates $(\tau,U)$, we find that one can evolve the waves
so that WKB in these coordinates is valid throughout this transition region --
which contradicts the above identification of the breakdown of WKB as the cause
of the radiation. Instead, our analysis suggests that the tearing apart of the
waves into two different asymptotic regions (inside and outside the horizon) is
the major ingredient of Hawking radiation.

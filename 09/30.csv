in both the theoretical and empirical perspectives. A central place fractal can
be treated as a monofractal with a single scaling process. However, in the real
world, a system of human settlements is a complex network with multi-scaling
processes. The simple fractal central place models are not enough to interpret
the spatial patterns and evolutive processes of urban systems. It is necessary
to construct multi-scaling fractal models of urban places. Based on the
postulate of intermittent space filling, two typical multifractal models of
central places are proposed in this paper. One model is put forward to reflect
the process of spatial convergence (aggregation), and the generalized
correlation dimension varies from 0.7306 to 1.3181; the other model is
presented to describe the process of spatial divergence (diffusion), the
generalized correlation dimension ranges from 1.6523 to 1.7118. As a case
study, an analogy is drawn between the theoretical models and a system of
cities and towns of Central Plains, China. A finding is that urban systems take
on multifractal form, and can be modeled with multi-scaling fractals. This is a
preliminary attempt to develop the theory of fractal central places, and the
results are helpful for understanding the similarities and differences between
the geographical process of spatial aggregation and that of spatial diffusion.

essential field of image processing. The basic principle of this paper is to
fuse multi-focus images using simple statistical standard deviation. Firstly,
the simple standard deviation for the k-by-k window inside each of the
multi-focus images was computed. The contribution in this paper came from the
idea that the focused part inside an image had high details rather than the
unfocused part. Hence, the dispersion between pixels inside the focused part is
higher than the dispersion inside the unfocused part. Secondly, a simple
comparison between the standard deviation for each k-by-k window in the
multi-focus images could be computed. The highest standard deviation between
all the computed standard deviations for the multi-focus images could be
treated as the optimal that is to be placed in the fused image. The
experimental visual results show that the proposed method produces very
satisfactory results in spite of its simplicity.

that the absence of broad [O III] forbidden emission lines is due to

decarbonisation of the global electricity sector in a non-equilibrium economic
and technology diffusion perspective. Energy markets are driven by innovation,
path-dependent technology choices and diffusion. However, conventional
optimisation models lack detail on these aspects and have limited ability to
address the effectiveness of policy interventions because they do not represent
decision-making. As a result, known effects of technology lock-ins are liable
to be underestimated. In contrast, our approach places investor decision-making
at the core of the analysis and investigates how it drives the diffusion of
low-carbon technology in a highly disaggregated, hybrid, global
macroeconometric model, FTT:Power-E3MG. Ten scenarios to 2050 of the
electricity sector in 21 regions exploring combinations of electricity policy
instruments are analysed, including their climate impacts. We show that in a
diffusion and path-dependent perspective, the impact of combinations of
policies does not correspond to the sum of impacts of individual instruments:
synergies exist between policy tools. We argue that the carbon price required
to break the current fossil technology lock-in can be much lower when combined
with other policies, and that a 90% decarbonisation of the electricity sector
by 2050 is affordable without early scrapping.

highlight the differences with colliding winds from massive stars. We focus on
evolution with increasing values of the Lorentz factor of the pulsar wind,
keeping in mind that current simulations are unable to reach the expected
values of the pulsar wind Lorentz factors by orders of magnitude. We use high
resolution numerical simulations with a relativistic extension to the

the region close to the binary, neglecting orbital motion. We use different
values of the Lorentz factor of the pulsar wind, up to 16. We find analytic
scaling relations between stellar wind collisions and gamma-ray binaries. They
provide the position of the contact discontinuity. The position of the shocks
strongly depends on the Lorentz factor, the relativistic wind is more
collimated than expected based on non-relativistic simulations. Beyond a
certain distance, the shocked flow is accelerated to its initial velocity and
follows adiabatic expansion. We provide guidance for extrapolation towards more
realistic values of the Lorentz factor of the pulsar wind. We extended the
adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES to relativistic hydrodynamics. This code
is suited for the study of astrophysical objects such as pulsar wind nebulae,
gamma-ray bursts or relativistic jets and will be part of the next public

and to restore the regularity of the AdS spacetime at a finite distance from
the brane by introducing an appropriate bulk energy-momentum tensor. As a
source for this bulk matter, we are considering a variety of non-ordinary
field-theory models of scalar fields either minimally-coupled to gravity, but
including non-canonical kinetic terms, mixing terms, derivative interactions

the Ricci scalar. In all models considered, even in the ones characterised by a
high-degree of flexibility, a negative result was reached. Our analysis
demonstrates how difficult the analytic construction of a localised brane-world

with regard to the question of the existence or not of a static classical black

for identifying, among a large number of Cryo-EM projection images, similar

features are based on the bispectrum. Each image is denoised and compressed
using steerable principal component analysis (PCA) such that rotating an image
is equivalent to phase shifting the expansion coefficients. Thus we are able to
extend the theory of bispectrum of 1D periodic signals to 2D images. The
randomized PCA algorithm is then used to efficiently reduce the dimensionality

between any pair of images. The nearest neighbors provide an initial
classification of similar viewing angles. In this way, rotational alignment is
only performed for images with their nearest neighbors. The initial nearest
neighbor classification and alignment are further improved by a new
classification method called vector diffusion maps. Our pipeline for viewing

Galaxy is ideal for investigating very massive stars and clusters located in
the same environment. We used archival infrared images to investigate the

Galactic Center. We find that two such isolated massive stars display apparent
bow shocks and hence may be ""runaways"" from their birthplace. Thus, some
isolated massive stars in the Galactic Center region might have been born in
star clusters known in this region. However, no bow shock is detected around

in jets consisting of a highly relativistic core of opening angle theta_j and
Lorentz factor Gamma_0, and a surrounding shear layer where the Lorentz factor
is decreasing as a power law of index p with angle from the jet axis. We find
significant degrees of linear polarization for observers located at viewing
angles theta_v \gtrsim theta_j. In particular, the polarization degree of
emission from narrow jets (theta_j \approx 1/Gamma_0) with steep Lorentz factor
gradients (p \gtrsim 4) reaches \sim 40%. The angle of polarization may shift
by pi/2 for time-variable jets. The spectrum below the thermal peak of the
polarized emission appears non-thermal due to aberration of light, without the
need for additional radiative processes or energy dissipation. Furthermore,
above the thermal peak a power law of photons forms due to Comptonization of
photons that repeatedly scatter between regions of different Lorentz factor
before escaping. We show that polarization degrees of a few tens of percent and
broken power law spectra are natural in the context of photospheric emission
from structured jets. Applying the model to gamma-ray bursts, we discuss
expected correlations between the spectral shape and the polarization degree of

that well-known numerical approximation processes such as Euler-Maruyama

identify a class of stopped increment-tamed Euler approximations which preserve

transient point-like sources, such as supernova remnants, the flux of the CR
primary component measured at Earth depends on the local source history.
Whereas the secondary omponent shows little to no variation due to nearby
sources, and instead, should depend on the global distribution of CRs.
Steady-state, rotational symmetric models (2D) of CR propagation assume
smeared-out CR sources in the Galaxy and cannot properly take into account the
influence of nearby point sources. In this paper, we infer evidence of nearby
sources by illustrating that a 2D propagation model will not describe CR
primaries and secondaries equally well. We adapted the 2D version of the
GALPROP code to a compute-cluster environment and perform parameter studies
comparing CR spectra with primary and secondary CR data separately. Doing a
parameter study, one may expect different best fit values looking at the
primary and secondary CR components separately, as it is unlikely that the
source history mimicked by the 2D models coincides with the real local source
history. We find that the primaries and secondaries are fitted with differing
best fit parameters, with the results indicating that the 2D model being more
suited to modelling secondary CRs. The insufficient modelling of primary CRs
can be contributed to the possible presence of local CR sources.

cross-correlating the positions of about one million red galaxies at z~0.5 and
the flux decrements induced in the spectra of about 10^5 background quasars
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find that: (i) This galaxy-gas
correlation reveals a change of slope on scales of about 1 Mpc, consistent with
the expected transition from a dark matter halo dominated environment to a
regime where clustering is dominated by halo-halo correlations. Assuming that,
on average, the distribution of Mg II gas follows that of dark matter up to a
gas-to-mass ratio, we find the standard halo model to provide an accurate
description of the gas distribution over three orders of magnitude in scale.
Within this framework we estimate the average host halo mass of luminous red
galaxies to be about 10^{13.5} M_solar, in agreement with other methods. We
also find the Mg II gas-to-mass ratio around LRGs to be consistent with the
cosmic value estimated on Mpc scales. Combining our galaxy-gas correlation and
the galaxy-mass correlation function from galaxy-galaxy lensing analyses we can
directly measure the Mg II gas-to-mass ratio as a function of scale and reach
the same conclusion. (ii) From line-width estimates, we show that the velocity
dispersion of the gas clouds also shows the expected 1- and 2-halo behaviors.
On large scales the gas distribution follows the Hubble flow, whereas on small
scales we observe the velocity dispersion of the Mg II gas clouds to be lower
than that of collisionless dark matter particles within their host halo. This
is in line with the fact that cool clouds are subject to the pressure of the
virialized hot gas.

determine the support of the reflectivity vector and the values of its nonzero

because of the multiple scattering. We show in this paper how to avoid the

involves $\ell_1$ norm minimization. However, under certain illuminations
imaging may be affected by screening, where some scatterers are obscured by
multiple scattering. This problem can be mitigated by using multiple and
diverse illuminations. In this case, we determine solution vectors that have a
common support. The uniqueness and stability of the support of the reflectivity
vector obtained with single or multiple illuminations are analyzed, showing
that the errors are proportional to the amount of noise in the data with a
proportionality factor dependent on the sparsity of the solution and the mutual
coherence of the sensing matrix, which is determined by the geometry of the

quantum Liouville theory on the torus and the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit of the

formulae for the accessory parameter of the Lame equation. This quantity is in
particular crucial for solving the problem of uniformization of the
one-punctured torus. The computation of the accessory parameters for torus and
sphere is an open longstanding problem which can however be solved if one
succeeds to derive an expression for the so-called classical Liouville action.
The method of calculation of the latter has been proposed some time ago by
Zamolodchikov brothers. Studying the semiclassical limit of the four-point
function of the quantum Liouville theory on the sphere they have derived the
classical action for the Riemann sphere with four punctures. In the present
work Zamolodchikovs idea is exploited in the case of the Liouville field theory
on the torus. It is found that the Lame accessory parameter is determined by
the classical Liouville action on the one-punctured torus or more concretely by
the torus classical block evaluated on the saddle point intermediate classical
weight. Secondly, as an implication of the aforementioned correspondence it is
obtained that the torus accessory parameter is related to the sum of all
rescaled column lengths of the so-called ""critical"" Young diagrams extremizing
the instanton ""free energy"" for the N=2* gauge theory. Finally, it is pointed
out that thanks to the known relation the sum over the ""critical"" column
lengths can be expressed in terms of a contour integral in which the integrand
is built out of certain special functions.

We describe the service architecture, including reporting and analytical

roughly 500 students studying electromagnetism, we find that the 229 students
who worked fifty or more problems over the term outperformed their complement
by 0.40 grade points (on a 4.0 scale). This improvement partly reflects a
selection bias that better students used the service more frequently. Adjusting
for this selection bias by using overall grade point average (GPA) as a

significantly above the random noise level of 0.04. Simply put, students who
worked one or more additional problem per weekday earned nearly a

efficiency improvements up to a factor of ~13. The estimation of parameters of
gravitational-wave signals measured by ground-based detectors is currently done
through Bayesian inference with MCMC one of the leading sampling methods.
Posteriors for these signals are typically multimodal with strong non-linear

improved sensitivities and wider bandwidths will drastically increase the

often called massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), has drawn
considerable interest because of its potential ability to revolutionize current
wireless communication systems. Most literature on massive MIMO systems assumes
time division duplexing (TDD), although frequency division duplexing (FDD)
dominates current cellular systems. Due to the large number of transmit
antennas at the base station, currently standardized approaches would require a
large percentage of the precious downlink and uplink resources in FDD massive
MIMO be used for training signal transmissions and channel state information
(CSI) feedback. To reduce the overhead of the downlink training phase, we
propose practical open-loop and closed-loop training frameworks in this paper.
We assume the base station and the user share a common set of training signals
in advance. In open-loop training, the base station transmits training signals
in a round-robin manner, and the user successively estimates the current
channel using long-term channel statistics such as temporal and spatial
correlations and previous channel estimates. In closed-loop training, the user
feeds back the best training signal to be sent in the future based on channel
prediction and the previously received training signals. With a small amount of
feedback from the user to the base station, closed-loop training offers better
performance in the data communication phase, especially when the
signal-to-noise ratio is low, the number of transmit antennas is large, or
prior channel estimates are not accurate at the beginning of the communication
setup, all of which would be mostly beneficial for massive MIMO systems.

central reactions at both energies, it increases gradually with increasing
impact parameter and becomes comparable with or even larger than the symmetry
energy effect in peripheral collisions especially at 400 MeV/nucleon. Moreover,
we found that while the \rpi ratio is larger with a softer \esym in central
collisions, above certain impact parameters depending on the size of the
neutron skin, a stiffer \esym can lead to a larger \rpi ratio as most of the
pions are produced at densities below the saturation density in these

extract reliable information about the \esym at suprasaturation densities (size
of neutron skin) from the $\pi^-/\pi^+$ ratio in central (peripheral) heavy-ion

weak orientability. The Bland-Jensen linear equations for a matroid M have a
solution if and only if M is weakly orientable. We use the Bland-Jensen system
to determine weak orientability for all matroids on at most nine elements and
all matroids between ten and twelve elements having rank three. Our experiments
indicate that for small rank, about half the time, when a simple matroid is not
orientable, it is already non-weakly orientable. Thus, about half of the small
simple non-orientable matroids of rank three are not representable over fields
having order congruent to three modulo four. For binary matroids, the
Bland-Jensen linear systems provide a practical way to check orientability.
Second, we present two extensions of the Bland-Jensen equations to slightly
larger systems of non-linear polynomial equations. Our systems of polynomial
equations have a solution if and only if the associated matroid M is
orientable. The systems come in two versions, one directly extending the
Bland-Jensen system for GF(2), and a different system working over other
fields. We study some basic algebraic properties of these systems. Finally, we
present an infinite family of non-weakly-orientable matroids, with growing rank

  Clusters","14 pages",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Large-scale storage cluster systems need to manage a vast amount of data
locations. A naive data locations management maintains pairs of data ID and
nodes storing the data in tables. However, it is not practical when the number
of pairs is too large. To solve this problem, management using data
distribution algorithms, rather than management using tables, has been proposed
in recent research. It can distribute data by determining the node for storing
the data based on the datum ID. Such data distribution algorithms require the
ability to handle the addition or removal of nodes, short calculation time and
uniform data distribution in the capacity of each node. This paper proposes a
data distribution algorithm called ASURA (Advanced Scalable and Uniform storage
by Random number Algorithm) that satisfies these requirements. It achieves
following four characteristics: 1) minimum data movement to maintain data
distribution according to node capacity when nodes are added or removed, even
if data are replicated, 2) roughly sub-micro-seconds calculation time, 3) much
lower than 1% maximum variability between nodes in data distribution, and 4)
data distribution according to the capacity of each node. The evaluation
results show that ASURA is qualitatively and quantitatively competitive against
major data distribution algorithms such as Consistent Hashing, Weighted
Rendezvous Hashing and Random Slicing. The comparison results show benefits of
each algorithm; they show that ASURA has advantage in large scale-out storage
clusters.

methods with its popularity. In its simplest form it scans the target area and
time to find regions with disease count higher than expected. If the shape and
size of the disease outbreaks are known, then to detect it sufficiently early
the scan statistic can design its search area to be efficient for this shape
and size. A plan that is efficient at detecting a range of disease outbreak
shapes and sizes is important because these vary from one outbreak to the next
and are generally never known in advance. This paper offers a forward selection
scan statistic that reduces the computational effort on the usual single window
scan plan, while still offering greater flexibility in signalling outbreaks of
varying shapes. The approach starts by dividing the target geographical regions
into a lattice. Secondly it smooths the time series of lattice cell counts
using multivariate exponential weighted moving averages. Thirdly, these EWMA
cell counts are spatially smoothed to reduce spatial noise and leave the
spatial signal. The fourth step uses forward selection approach to scanning
mutually exclusive and exhaustive rectangular regions of dynamic dimensions. In
the fifth step, it prunes away all insignificant scanned regions where counts
are not significantly higher than expected. An outbreak is signaled if at least
one region remains after pruning. If all regions are pruned away - including
the scan of the target region, then no outbreak is signaled.

need for further splitting (i.e. whether parameter(s) of longitudinal profile
is influenced by any baseline attributes) via parameter instability tests and
thus the decision of further splitting is type-I error controlled. We have
obtained the asymptotic results for the proposed instability test and examined

strike-slip instability of plate tectonics along the fault lines. Several
events of earthquake around the globe have happened which cannot be explained
by this theory. In this work we investigated the earthquake data along with
other observed facts like heat flow profiles etc... of the Indian subcontinent.
In our studies we found a high-quality correlation between the earthquake
events, seismic prone zones, heat flow regions and the geothermal hot springs.
As a consequence, we proposed a hypothesis which can adequately explain all the
earthquake events around the globe as well as the overall geo-dynamics. It is
basically the geothermal power, which makes the plates to stand still, strike
and slip over. The plates are merely a working solid while the driving force is
the geothermal energy. The violent flow and enormous pressure of this power
shake the earth along the plate boundaries and also triggers the intra-plate
seismicity. In the light of the results reported by the California Energy
Commission from the ongoing geothermal power project at the Big Geysers in
California, we further propounded that by harnessing the surplus geothermal
energy the intensity and risk of the impending earthquakes can be substantially
reduced.

communication complexity. They have been studied for both classical and also
quantum communication and for various models and modes of communication.
Buhrman et al. [Buh98] proved that the exact quantum communication complexity
for a promise version of the equality problem is ${\bf O}(\log {n})$ while the
classical deterministic communication complexity is $n+1$ for two-way
communication, which was the first impressively large (exponential) gap between
quantum and classical (deterministic and probabilistic) communication
complexity. If an error is tolerated, both quantum and probabilistic
communication complexities for equality are ${\bf O}(\log {n})$. However, even
if an error is tolerated, the gaps between quantum (probabilistic) and
deterministic complexity are not larger than quadratic for the disjointness
problem. It is therefore interesting to ask whether there are some promise
versions of the disjointness problem for which bigger gaps can be shown. We
give a positive answer to such a question. Namely, we prove that there exists
an exponential gap between quantum (even probabilistic) communication
complexity and classical deterministic communication complexity of some
specific versions of the disjointness problem.
  Klauck [Kla00] proved, for any language, that the state complexity of exact
quantum/classical finite automata, which is a general model of one-way quantum
finite automata, is not less than the state complexity of an equivalent one-way
deterministic finite automata (1DFA). In this paper we show, using a
communication complexity result, that situation may be different for some
promise problems. Namely, we show for certain promise problem that the gap
between the state complexity of exact one-way quantum finite automata and 1DFA
can be exponential.

contraction law obtained in Special Relativity. More specifically, the

Against this background, we show how our results are consistent with, i) the
generalised form of the Uncertainty Principle (GUP), ii) the so called
hoop-conjecture which we interpret, presently, as the saturation of a Lorentz
boost by the formation of a black hole in a two-body scattering, and iii) the
intriguing notion of ""classicalization"" of trans-Planckian physics. Pushing
these ideas to their logical conclusion, we argue that there is a physical
limit to the Lorentz contraction rule in the form of some minimal universal
length determined by quantum gravity, say the Planck Length, or any of its
current embodiments such as the string length, or the TeV quantum gravity
length scale. In the latter case, we determine the \emph{critical boost} that
separates the ordinary ""particle phase,"" characterized by the Compton
wavelength, from the ""black hole phase"", characterized by the effective
Schwarzschild radius of the colliding system. Finally, with the
""classicalization"" of quantum gravity in mind, we comment on the remarkable
identity, to our knowledge never noticed before, between three seemingly
independent universal quantities, namely, a) the ""string tension"", b) the
""linear energy density,"" or \emph{tension} that exists at the core of all
Schwarzschild black holes, and c) the ""superforce"" i.e., the Planckian limit of
the static electro-gravitational force and, presumably, the unification point

we explore properties of distributions of sums of independent means of
independent lattice-valued random variables. The aim is to determine the extent
to which approximations to those sums require continuity corrections. We show
that, in cases where there are only two different means, the main effects of
distribution smoothness can be understood in terms of the ratio
$\rho_{12}=(e_2n_1)/(e_1n_2)$, where $e_1$ and $e_2$ are the respective maximal
lattice edge widths of the two populations, and $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the
respective sample sizes used to compute the means. If $\rho_{12}$ converges to
an irrational number, or converges sufficiently slowly to a rational number;
and in a number of other cases too, for example those where $\rho_{12}$ does
not converge; the effects of the discontinuity of lattice distributions are of
smaller order than the effects of skewness. However, in other instances, for
example where $\rho_{12}$ converges relatively quickly to a rational number,
the effects of discontinuity and skewness are of the same size. We also treat
higher-order properties, arguing that cases where $\rho_{12}$ converges to an
algebraic irrational number can be less prone to suffer the effects of
discontinuity than cases where the limiting irrational is transcendental. These
results are extended to the case of three or more different means, and also to
problems where distributions are estimated using the bootstrap. The results
have practical interpretation in terms of the accuracy of inference for, among
other quantities, the sum or difference of binomial proportions.

probability. In this survey paper, we review some of these developments and
point to some areas that might deserve further investigation. We start by
reviewing the basics of arbitrage pricing theory, with special emphasis on
incomplete markets and on the different roles played by the ""real-world""
probability measure and its equivalent martingale measures. We then focus on
the issue of model ambiguity, also called Knightian uncertainty. We present two
case studies in which it is possible to deal with Knightian uncertainty in
mathematical terms. The first case study concerns the hedging of derivatives,
such as variance swaps, in a strictly pathwise sense. The second one deals with
capital requirements and preferences specified by convex and coherent risk
measures. In the final two sections we discuss mathematical issues arising from
the dramatic increase of algorithmic trading in modern financial markets.

submillimeter wavelengths with the Herschel Space Observatory have provided us
with unprecedented images of the initial conditions and early phases of the

filamentary structure in every interstellar cloud. These filaments all exhibit
remarkably similar widths - about a tenth of a parsec - but only the densest
ones contain prestellar cores, the seeds of future stars. The Herschel results
favor a scenario in which interstellar filaments and prestellar cores represent
two key steps in the star formation process: first turbulence stirs up the gas,
giving rise to a universal web-like structure in the interstellar medium, then
gravity takes over and controls the further fragmentation of filaments into
prestellar cores and ultimately protostars. This scenario provides new insight
into the inefficiency of star formation, the origin of stellar masses, and the
global rate of star formation in galaxies. Despite an apparent complexity,
global star formation may be governed by relatively simple universal laws from
filament to galactic scales.

a long pattern of rises and falls decays exponentially with its length $n$ in
general. The associated decay rate $\alpha$ is interpreted as the embedding

of generalized hyperbolic or trigonometric functions. Alternating patterns have
the smallest rate $\alpha_{{\rm min}}=\ln(\pi/2)=0.451582\dots$, while other

uniformly chosen random patterns are demonstrated to obey multifractal

geometrical properties of the space of light rays, i.e., unparametrized

a canonical differentiable structure diffeomorphic to the original manifold

tangent to skies, play a fundamental role in the analysis of the geometry of
the space of light rays. It will be shown that a celestial curve is induced by
a past causal curve of events iff the legendrian isotopy defined by it is
non-negative. This result extends in a nontrivial way some recent results by
Chernov \emph{et al} on Low's Legendrian conjecture. Finally, it will be shown
that a celestial causal map between the space of light rays of two strongly
causal spaces (provided that the target space is null non-conjugate) is
necessarily induced from a conformal immersion and conversely. These results

shows that when tuning away from phase matching, a dominating narrow spectral
peak appears in the second harmonic that can be tuned over 100's of nm by
changing the phase-mismatch parameter. Traditional theory explains this as
phase matching between a sideband in the broadband pump to its second-harmonic.
However, our experiment is conducted under high input intensities and instead
shows excellent quantitative agreement with a nonlocal theory describing
cascaded quadratic nonlinearities. This theory explains the detuned peak as a
nonlocal resonance that arises due to phase-matching between the pump and a
detuned second-harmonic frequency, but where in contrast to the traditional
theory the pump is assumed dispersion-free. As a soliton is inherently
dispersion-free, the agreement between our experiment and the nonlocal theory
indirectly proves that we have observed a soliton-induced nonlocal resonance.
The soliton exists in the self-defocusing regime of the cascaded nonlinear
interaction and in the normal dispersion regime of the crystal, and needs high
input intensities to become excited.

matter annihilation power produced by smooth and collapsed structures over
cosmic time, taking into account uncertainties in the structure of dark matter
halos. As we search for observational signatures of annihilation, an
understanding of this time evolution will help us to best direct our
observational efforts, either with local measurements or investigation of the
effects of annihilation on the intergalactic medium at high redshift. As I show
in this work, there are several key sources of uncertainty in our ability to
estimate the dark matter annihilation from collapsed structures, including: the
density profile of dark matter halos; the small-scale cut-off in the dark
matter halo mass function; the redshift-dependent mass-concentration relation
for small halos; and the particle-velocity dependence of the dark matter
annihilation process. Varying assumptions about these quantities can result in
annihilation power predictions that differ by several orders of magnitude.
These uncertainties must be resolved, through a combination of observation and
modeling, before robust estimations of the cosmological annihilation signal can
be made.

cathodes were made of Aluminum and had a surface exhibiting millimeter-deep
V-shaped grooves of 45{\deg}, upon which the thin Boron film was deposited by
DC magnetron sputtering. The incident neutrons interacting with the converter
layer deposited on the sidewalls of the grooves have a higher capture
probability, owing to the larger effective absorption film thickness. This
leads to a higher overall detection efficiency for the grooved cathode when
compared to a cathode with a flat surface. Both the experimental results and
the predictions of the GEANT4 model suggests that a 5-counter detector stack
with coated grooved cathodes has the same efficiency as a 7-counter stack with
flat cathodes. The reduction in the number of counters in the stack without
altering the detection efficiency will prove highly beneficial for large-area
position-sensitive detectors for neutron scattering applications, for which the
cost-effective manufacturing of the detector and associated readout electronics
is an important objective. The proposed detector concept could be a
technological option for one of the new chopper spectrometers and other

prevailing vertical magnetic field component. They can include light bridges at
places with locally reduced magnetic field. Like sunspots, they exhibit a wide
range of oscillatory phenomena.
  Aims: A large isolated pore with a light bridge (NOAA 11005) is studied to
obtain characteristics of a chromospheric filamentary structure around the
pore, to analyse oscillations and waves in and around the pore, and to
understand the structure and brightness of the light bridge.
  Methods: Spectral imaging observations in the line Ca II 854.2 nm and
complementary spectropolarimetry in Fe I lines, obtained with the DST/IBIS
spectrometer and HINODE/SOT spectropolarimeter, were used to measure
photospheric and chromospheric velocity fields, oscillations, waves, the
magnetic field in the photosphere, and acoustic energy flux and radiative
losses in the chromosphere.
  Results: The chromospheric filamentary structure around the pore has all
important characteristics of a superpenumbra: it shows an inverse Evershed
effect and running waves, and has a similar morphology and oscillation
character. The granular structure of the light bridge in the upper photosphere
can be explained by radiative heating. Acoustic waves leaking up from the
photosphere along the inclined magnetic field in the light bridge transfer
enough energy flux to balance the total radiative losses of the light-bridge
chromosphere.
  Conclusions: The presence of a penumbra is not a necessary condition for the
formation of a superpenumbra. The light bridge is heated by radiation in the
photosphere and by acoustic waves in the chromosphere.

to derive the precise position of the convergent point of the comoving
association from the stars' proper motions. We used published proper motion
catalogs and searched the literature for radial velocities, which are needed to
compute individual parallaxes. We supplemented the radial velocity data with
new measurements from spectroscopic observations performed with the FEROS
spectrograph mounted on the MPG/ESO 2.2m telescope at La Silla. We identify a
comoving group with 109 pre-main sequence stars and candidates that define the
kinematic properties of the Lupus low-mass star-forming region. We derive
individual parallaxes for stars with known radial velocity and tentative
parallaxes for the remaining group members by assuming that all stars share the
same space motion. The convergent point method, combined with the k-NN
algorithm, makes it possible to distinguish the Lupus and Upper Centaurus Lupus
stars from the adjacent Scorpius-Centaurus association. We find significant
depth effects in this region and show that the classical T Tauri stars, located
in the close vicinity of the Lupus molecular clouds, form a background

of solvable groups H_{mn} that are semidirect products of R^m and R^n, and for
which the structure homomorphism maps nontrivially into the center of Aut(R^n).
The first result states that the closure of a semigroup generated by a set in
H_{mn} that is not included in a maximal semigroup with nonempty interior is
actually a group. The second result states that among the subsets of H_{mn}
that are not included in a maximal proper semigroup, those that generate H_{mn}
as a closed semigroup are dense. Results of this nature were obtained before
only for extensions of nilpotent groups. Results of this nature were obtained
before only for abelian and nilpotent Lie groups and their compact extensions.
As an application of the technique developed in the paper, we find the minimal
number of generators as a closed group and as a closed semigroup of H_{mn}.

proportional to product of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients (CGC) and the velocity
to some positive power. The latter can be zero in which case the HA is
non-vanishing at the endpoint. In essence the spatial rotational symmetry,
broken by the relative spatial momenta of the particles, is restored at the
kinematic endpoint. Therefore SO(3) and SU(2), for bosons and fermion in the

understood in terms of the Wigner- Eckart theorem. The findings are useful for
i) checking theoretical computations and ii) the case where there is a sequence
of decays, say $B \to B_1B_2$ with the pair $(B_1B_2)$ not interacting
(significantly) with the $C$-particle. An example is $H \to Z Z^* \to 4\ell$

the filing factor of inhomogeneities (\leq0.5), and the mass of the

analysis. It amounts to estimating the parameters of a linear model that maps
input features to corresponding outputs. In the classical setting where the
precision of each data point is fixed, the famous Aitken/Gauss-Markov theorem
in statistics states that generalized least squares (GLS) is a so-called ""Best
Linear Unbiased Estimator"" (BLUE). In modern data science, however, one often
faces strategic data sources, namely, individuals who incur a cost for
providing high-precision data.
  In this paper, we study a setting in which features are public but
individuals choose the precision of the outputs they reveal to an analyst. We
assume that the analyst performs linear regression on this dataset, and
individuals benefit from the outcome of this estimation. We model this scenario
as a game where individuals minimize a cost comprising two components: (a) an
(agent-specific) disclosure cost for providing high-precision data; and (b) a
(global) estimation cost representing the inaccuracy in the linear model
estimate. In this game, the linear model estimate is a public good that
benefits all individuals. We establish that this game has a unique non-trivial
Nash equilibrium. We study the efficiency of this equilibrium and we prove
tight bounds on the price of stability for a large class of disclosure and
estimation costs. Finally, we study the estimator accuracy achieved at
equilibrium. We show that, in general, Aitken's theorem does not hold under
strategic data sources, though it does hold if individuals have identical
disclosure costs (up to a multiplicative factor). When individuals have
non-identical costs, we derive a bound on the improvement of the equilibrium
estimation cost that can be achieved by deviating from GLS, under mild
assumptions on the disclosure cost functions.

thick gas in the host galaxy. We show that in luminous AGN, the radiation
pressure likely confines the ionized layer of the illuminated gas. Radiation
pressure confinement (RPC) has two main implications. First, the gas density
near the ionization front is 7x10^4 L_{i,45} r_{50}^{-2} cm^{-3}, where
L_{i,45} is the ionizing luminosity in units of 10^45 erg/s and r_{50} is the
distance of the gas from the nucleus in units of 50 pc. Second, as shown by
Dopita et al., the solution of the ionization structure within each slab is
unique, independent of the ambient pressure. We show that the RPC density vs.
distance relation is observed over a dynamical range of ~10^4 in distance, from
sub-pc to kpc from the nucleus, and a range of ~10^8 in gas density, from 10^3
to 10^11 cm^{-3}. This relation implies that the radiative force of luminous
AGN can compress giant molecular clouds in the host galaxy, and possibly affect
the star formation rate. The unique ionization structure in RPC includes a
highly ionized X-ray emitting surface, an intermediate layer which emits
coronal lines, and a lower ionization inner layer which emits optical lines.
This structure can explain the observed overlap of the extended X-ray and
optical narrow line emission in nearby AGN. We further support RPC by comparing
the predicted ratios of the narrow lines strength and narrow line widths with
available observations. We suggest a new method, based on the narrow line
widths, to estimate the black hole mass of low luminosity AGN.

multipliers, we prove the Gong-Song conjecture for $q$ prime. Furthermore, we

eHealth. In order to reduce on-chip energy consumption and extend sensor life,
recorded signals are usually compressed before transmission. In this paper, we
adopt compressed sensing (CS) as a low-power compression framework, and propose
a fast block sparse Bayesian learning (BSBL) algorithm to reconstruct original
signals. Experiments on real-world fetal ECG signals and epilepsy EEG signals
showed that the proposed algorithm has good balance between speed and data
reconstruction fidelity when compared to state-of-the-art CS algorithms.
Further, we implemented the CS-based compression procedure and a low-power
compression procedure based on a wavelet transform in Filed Programmable Gate
Array (FPGA), showing that the CS-based compression can largely save energy and
other on-chip computing resources.

  Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society Main Journal",,"10.1093/mnras/stu071",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we derive an exact full expression for the 2D probability
distribution of the ellipticity of an object measured from data, only assuming
Gaussian noise in pixel values. This is a generalisation of the probability
distribution for the ratio of single random variables, that is well-known, to
the multivariate case. This expression is derived within the context of the
measurement of weak gravitational lensing from noisy galaxy images. We find
that the third flattening, or epsilon-ellipticity, has a biased maximum
likelihood but an unbiased mean; and that the third eccentricity, or normalised
polarisation chi, has both a biased maximum likelihood and a biased mean. The
very fact that the bias in the ellipticity is itself a function of the
ellipticity requires an accurate knowledge of the intrinsic ellipticity
distribution of the galaxies in order to properly calibrate shear measurements.
We use this expression to explore strategies for calibration of biases caused
by measurement processes in weak gravitational lensing. We find that upcoming
weak lensing surveys like KiDS or DES require calibration fields of order of
several square degrees and 1.2 magnitude deeper than the wide survey in order
to correct for the noise bias. Future surveys like Euclid will require
calibration fields of order 40 square degree and several magnitude deeper than
the wide survey. We also investigate the use of the Stokes parameters to
estimate the shear as an alternative to the ellipticity. We find that they can
provide unbiased shear estimates at the cost of a very large variance in the
measurement. The python code used to compute the distributions presented in the
paper and to perform the numerical calculations are available on request.

steepest-descent pathways, and the differences can be controlled to some extent
by adjustment of the maximum step size. The choice of the most convenient

system identification. Recent approaches use quadratic penalty terms on the
unknown impulse response defined by stable spline kernels, which control model
space complexity by leveraging regularity and bounded-input bounded-output
stability. This paper extends linear system identification to a wide class of
nonsmooth stable spline estimators, where regularization functionals and data
misfits can be selected from a rich set of piecewise linear-quadratic (PLQ)
penalties. This class includes the 1-norm, Huber, and Vapnik, in addition to
the least-squares penalty.
  By representing penalties through their conjugates, the modeler can specify
any piecewise linear-quadratic penalty for misfit and regularizer, as well as
inequality constraints on the response. The interior-point solver we implement
(IPsolve) is locally quadratically convergent, with $O(\min(m,n)^2(m+n))$
arithmetic operations per iteration, where $n$ the number of unknown impulse
response coefficients and $m$ the number of observed output measurements.
IPsolve is competitive with available alternatives for system identification.
This is shown by a comparison with TFOCS, libSVM, and the FISTA algorithm. The
code is open source (https://github.com/saravkin/IPsolve).
  The impact of the approach for system identification is illustrated with
numerical experiments featuring robust formulations for contaminated data,
relaxation systems, nonnegativity and unimodality constraints on the impulse
response, and sparsity promoting regularization. Incorporating constraints
yields particularly significant improvements.

galaxies along cosmic time. This goal can be achieved with far-IR spectroscopic
cosmological surveys. SPICA in combination with ground based large single dish
submillimeter telescopes, such as CCAT, will offer a unique opportunity to do
this. We use galaxy evolution models linked to the observed MIR-FIR counts
(including Herschel) to predict the number of sources and their IR lines
fluxes, as derived from observations of local galaxies. A shallow survey in an
area of 0.5 square degrees, with a typical integration time of 1 hour per
pointing, will be able to detect thousands of galaxies in at least three
emission lines, using SAFARI, the far-IR spectrometer onboard of SPICA.

nilpotent algebras are proved to possess quantum cluster algebra structures
under mild conditions. Furthermore, it is shown that these quantum cluster
algebras always equal the corresponding upper quantum cluster algebras.
Previous approaches to these problems for the construction of (quantum) cluster
algebra structures on (quantized) coordinate rings arising in Lie theory were
done on a case by case basis relying on the combinatorics of each concrete
family. The results of the paper have a broad range of applications to these
problems, including the construction of quantum cluster algebra structures on
quantum unipotent groups and quantum double Bruhat cells (the
Berenstein-Zelevinsky conjecture), and treat these problems from a unified
perspective. All such applications also establish equality between the
constructed quantum cluster algebras and their upper counterparts. The proofs
rely on Chatters' notion of noncommutative unique factorization domains. Toric
frames are constructed by considering sequences of homogeneous prime elements
of chains of noncommutative UFDs (a generalization of the construction of
Gelfand-Tsetlin subalgebras) and mutations are obtained by altering chains of
noncommutative UFDs. Along the way, an intricate (and unified) combinatorial
model for the homogeneous prime elements in chains of noncommutative UFDs and
their alterations is developed. When applied to special families, this recovers
the combinatorics of Weyl groups and double Weyl groups previously used in the
construction and categorification of cluster algebras. It is expected that this
combinatorial model of sequences of homogeneous prime elements will have
applications to the unified categorification of quantum nilpotent algebras.

with the ansatz that the brane fluctuates only in the warped ($\mu$) direction
in this slicing, which is particularly appropriate for studying the Janus
solution. The natural field theory dual in this slicing is $\mathcal{N}=4$
super Yang-Mills on two copies of $AdS_4$. Branes extending from $\mu=\pm\pi/2$
can end at different locations, giving rise to quarks with piecewise constant
mass on each $AdS_4$ half-space, jumping discontinuously between them. A second
class of flavor brane solutions exists in this coordinate system, dubbed
""continuous"" flavor branes, that extend across the entire range of $\mu$. We
propose that the correct dual interpretation of ""disconnected"" flavor brane in
this ansatz is a quark hypermultiplet with constant mass on one of the AdS$_4$
half-spaces with totally reflecting boundary conditions at the boundary of
AdS$_4$; whereas the dual interpretation of a continuous flavor brane has
totally transparent boundary conditions. Numerical studies indicate that
AdS-sliced D7 flavor branes of both classes exhibit spontaneous chiral symmetry
breaking, as non-zero vev persists for solutions of the equation of motion down
to zero mass. Continuous flavor branes in this ansatz exhibit many other
surprising behaviors: their masses seem to be capped at a modest value near
$m=0.551$ in units of the inverse AdS radius, and there may be a phase
transition between continuous branes of different configurations. We also
numerically study quark states in Janus. The behavior of mass and vev is
similar in Janus, including the existence of chiral symmetry breaking at zero
mass, though qualitative features of the phase diagram change (sometimes
significantly) as the Janus parameter $c_0$ increases.

variations are monitored via a broad-band filter and the echo of emission line
clouds of the broad line region (BLR) is measured with a suitable narrow-band
(NB) filter. We investigate how an incomplete emission-line coverage by the NB
filter influences the BLR size determination. This includes two basic cases: 1)
a symmetric cut of the blue and red part of the line wings, and 2) the filter
positioned asymmetrically to the line centre so that essentially a complete
half of the emission line is contained in the NB filter. Under the assumption
that the BLR size is dominated by circular Keplerian orbits, we find that
symmetric cutting of line wings may lead to overestimating the BLR size by less
than 5%. The case of asymmetric half-line coverage, similar as for our data of
the Seyfert 1 galaxy 3C120, yields the BLR size with a bias of less than 1%.
Our results suggest that any BLR size bias due to narrow-band line cut in
photometric reverberation mapping is small and in most cases negligible. We
used well sampled photometric reverberation mapping light curves with sharp
variation features in both the continuum and the Hbeta light curves to
determine the geometry type of the Hbeta BLR for 3C120. Modelling of the light
curve, under the assumption that the BLR is essentially virialised, argues
against a spherical geometry and favours a nearly face-on disk-like geometry
with inclination i = 10 +/- 4 deg and extension from 22 to 28 light days. The
low inclination may lead to a larger black hole mass than the derived when
using the average geometry scaling factor f=5.5. We discuss deviations of
Seyfert 1 galaxies from the M_BH - sigma relation.

transition to an orthorhombic (O) structure with space group Fmmm and a striped
antiferromagnet (AF) with space group F(C)mm'm' in Ba1-xNaxFe2As2 is of first
order. A complete suppression of the magnetic phase is observed by x = 0.30,
and bulk superconductivity occurs at a critical concentration near 0.15. We
compare the new findings to the previously reported results of the hole-doped
Ba1-xKxFe2As2 solid solution in order to resolve the differing effects of band
filling and A-site cation size on the properties of the magnetic and
superconducting ground states. The substantial size difference between Na and K
causes various changes in the lattice trends, yet the overarching property
phase diagram from the Ba1-xKxFe2As2 phase diagram carries over to the
Ba1-xNaxFe2As2 solid solution. We note that the composition dependence of the c
axis turns over from positive to negative around x = 0.35, unlike the
K-substituted materials. We show that this can be understood by invoking steric
effects; primarily the Fe2As2 layer shape is dictated mostly by the electronic
filling, which secondarily induces an interlayer spacing adjusted to compensate
for the given cation volume. This exemplifies the primacy of even subtle
features in the Fe2As2 layer in controlling both the structure and properties

Rayleigh scattering from H2 molecules. We therefore conclude that high
altitude, optically reflective clouds located west from the substellar point
are present in its atmosphere. We find that a silicate-based cloud composition
is a possible candidate. Kepler-7b exhibits several properties that may make it
particularly amenable to cloud formation in its upper atmosphere. These include
a hot deep atmosphere that avoids a cloud cold trap, very low surface gravity
to suppress cloud sedimentation, and a planetary equilibrium temperature in a
range that allows for silicate clouds to potentially form in the visible
atmosphere probed by Kepler. Our analysis does not only present evidence of
optically thick clouds on Kepler-7b but also yields the first map of clouds in
an exoplanet atmosphere.

considering other alkali metal species such as rubidium and potassium, we find
that the p-H2 ground-state is a liquid with a significantly large superfluid
fraction of ~30%. The appearance of p-H2 superfluid response is due to the fact
that the interactions between Na atoms and H2 molecules are less attractive
than between H2 molecules. This induces a considerable reduction of the

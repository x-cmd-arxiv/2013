  Direct Imaging Study for a Possibility of a False Positive","28 pages, 4 figures, submitted to ApJ",,,,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We report a discovery of a companion candidate around one of {\it Kepler}
Objects of Interest (KOIs), KOI-94, and results of our quantitative
investigation of the possibility that planetary candidates around KOI-94 are
false positives. KOI-94 has a planetary system in which four planetary
detections have been reported by {\it Kepler}, suggesting that this system is
intriguing to study the dynamical evolutions of planets. However, while two of
those detections (KOI-94.01 and 03) have been made robust by previous
observations, the others (KOI-94.02 and 04) are marginal detections, for which
future confirmations with various techniques are required. We have conducted
high-contrast direct imaging observations with Subaru/HiCIAO in $H$ band and
detected a faint object located at a separation of $\sim0.6''$ from KOI-94. The
object has a contrast of $\sim 1\times 10^{-3}$ in $H$ band, and corresponds to
an M type star on the assumption that the object is at the same distance of
KOI-94. Based on our analysis, KOI-94.02 is likely to be a real planet because
of its transit depth, while KOI-94.04 can be a false positive due to the
companion candidate. The success in detecting the companion candidate suggests
that high-contrast direct imaging observations are important keys to examine
false positives of KOIs. On the other hand, our transit light curve reanalyses
lead to a better period estimate of KOI-94.04 than that on the KOI catalogue
and show that the planetary candidate has the same limb darkening parameter
value as the other planetary candidates in the KOI-94 system, suggesting that
KOI-94.04 is also a real planet in the system.

non-ideal environments poses fundamental theoretical challenges in domains
ranging from inter and intra-cellular transport in biology to diffusion in
porous media. Yet, often the nature of the constraints coming from many-body
interactions or reflecting a complex and confining environment are better
understood and modeled at the microscopic level.
  In this paper we investigate the subtle link between microscopic exclusion
processes and the mean-field equations that ensue from them in the continuum
limit. We derive a generalized nonlinear advection diffusion equation suitable
for describing transport in a inhomogeneous medium in the presence of an
external field. Furthermore, taking inspiration from a recently introduced
exclusion process involving agents with non-zero size, we introduce a modified
diffusion equation appropriate for describing transport in a non-ideal fluid of
$d$-dimensional hard spheres.
  We consider applications of our equations to the problem of diffusion to an
absorbing sphere in a non-ideal self-crowded fluid and to the problem of
gravitational sedimentation. We show that our formalism allows one to recover
known results. Moreover, we introduce the notions of point-like and extended
crowding, which specify distinct routes for obtaining macroscopic transport
equations from microscopic exclusion processes.

(PTAs) as gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. To date, that interest has focused
mainly on three particularly promising source types: supermassive--black-hole
binaries, cosmic strings, and the stochastic background from early-Universe
phase transitions. In this paper, by contrast, our aim is to investigate the
PTA potential for discovering unanticipated sources. We derive significant
constraints on the available discovery space based solely on energetic and
statistical considerations: we show that a PTA detection of GWs at frequencies
above ~3.e-5 Hz would either be an extraordinary coincidence or violate
""cherished beliefs;"" we show that for PTAs GW memory can be more detectable
than direct GWs, and that, as we consider events at ever higher redshift, the
memory effect increasingly dominates an event's total signal-to-noise ratio.
The paper includes also a simple analysis of the effects of pulsar red noise in
PTA searches, and a demonstration that the effects of periodic GWs in the 10^-8
-- 10^-4.5 Hz band would not be degenerate with small errors in standard pulsar
parameters (except in a few narrow bands).

the cluster center (<2.3 arcmin ~ 750 kpc). The parent galaxies of the EIGs are
star-forming or post-starburst galaxies, all of which are spectroscopically
confirmed members of the cluster. Four out of the nine parent galaxies show
distortion of stellar distribution in the disk, which can be a sign of recent
interaction, and the interaction may have made EIGs. On the other hand, six
parent galaxies (one overlaps those exhibiting distortion) show H-alpha
emission without stars, which implies a ram pressure stripping.The spe ctrum of
the brightest parent galaxy shows a post-starburst signature, and resembles the
H-alpha stripped galaxies found in the Coma cluster. Meanwhile, two brightest
parent galaxies in A851 are more massive than the EIG parent galaxies in the

though it is still in a statistical fluctuation. We also analyzed Suprime-Cam

system's nonlinearities and noise propagations. We observe that such noise can
simultaneously enhance sensitivities in one behavioral region while reducing
sensitivities in another. Employing this novel phenomenon we designed three

as a concentration detector with both enhanced amplitude and sensitivity. (b) A
non-cooperative positive feedback system, with a graded dose-response in the
deterministic case, that serves as a bistable switch due to noise-induced

problem is known to be NP-hard, several numerically efficient local search
techniques with approximation guarantees are available. In this paper, we
propose a novel convex relaxation which is based on the relationship between
submodular functions, entropies and probabilistic graphical models. In a
graphical model, the entropy of the joint distribution decomposes as a sum of
marginal entropies of subsets of variables; moreover, for any distribution, the
entropy of the closest distribution factorizing in the graphical model provides
an bound on the entropy. For directed graphical models, this last property
turns out to be a direct consequence of the submodularity of the entropy
function, and allows the generalization of graphical-model-based upper bounds
to any submodular functions. These upper bounds may then be jointly maximized
with respect to a set, while minimized with respect to the graph, leading to a
convex variational inference scheme for maximizing submodular functions, based
on outer approximations of the marginal polytope and maximum likelihood bounded
treewidth structures. By considering graphs of increasing treewidths, we may
then explore the trade-off between computational complexity and tightness of
the relaxation. We also present extensions to constrained problems and

the powerful Wang-Landau flat-histogram method, we carry out in this work
intensive simulations over the whole range of $p$. We show that the first-order
transition disappears with a tiny amount of ferromagnetic bonds, namely $p\sim
0.01$, in agreement with theories and simulations on other 3D models. The
antiferromagnetic long-range order is also destroyed with a very small $p$

then to a ferromagnetic phase when $p>0.65$. The phase diagram in the space
($T_c,p$) shows an asymmetry, unlike the case of the $\pm J$ Ising spin glass
on the simple cubic lattice. We calculate the relaxation time around the
spin-glass transition temperature and we show that the spin autocorrelation
follows a stretched exponential relaxation law where the factor $b$ is equal to
$\simeq 1/3$ at the transition as suggested by the percolation-based theory.

effective temperatures ~3-7x10^5 K and luminosities of 10^{35-38} erg/s. SSS
grating spectra display atmospheric absorption lines. Radiation transport
atmosphere models can be used to derive physical parameters, but more
sophisticated models are required. We bypass the complications of spectral
models and concentrate on the data in a comparative, qualitative study. We
inspect all available X-ray grating SSS spectra to determine systematic,
model-independent trends. We use comparative plots of spectra of different
systems to find common and different features. The results are interpreted in
the context of system parameters obtained from the literature. We find two
distinct types of SSS spectra which we name SSa and SSe. Their main
observational characteristics are either clearly visible absorption lines or
emission lines, respectively, while both types contain atmospheric continuum
emission. SSe may be obscured SSa systems, which is supported by similarities
between SSe and SSa with obscured and unobscured AGN, respectively. Further, we
find all known or suspected high-inclination systems to emit permanently in an
SSe state. Some sources are found to transition between SSa and SSe states,
becoming SSe when fainter. SSS spectra are subject to various occultation
processes. In Cal 87, the accretion disc blocks the central hot source when
viewed edge on. In novae, the accretion disc may have been destroyed during the
initial explosion but could have reformed by the time of the SSS phase. In
addition, clumpy ejecta may lead to temporary obscuration events. The emission
lines originate from reprocessed emission in the accretion disc, its wind or
further out in clumpy ejecta while Thomson scattering allows continuum emission
to be visible also during total obscuration of the central hot source.

microbial dormancy, resulting in major model uncertainties. To facilitate the
consideration of dormancy in these large-scale models, we propose a new
microbial physiology component that works for a wide range of substrate
availabilities. This new model is based on microbial physiological states and
is majorly parameterized with the maximum specific growth and maintenance rates
of active microbes and the ratio of dormant to active maintenance rates. A
major improvement of our model over extant models is that it can explain the
low active microbial fractions commonly observed in undisturbed soils. Our new
model shows that the exponentially-increasing respiration from
substrate-induced respiration experiments can only be used to determine the
maximum specific growth rate and initial active microbial biomass, while the
respiration data representing both exponentially-increasing and
non-exponentially-increasing phases can robustly determine a range of key
parameters including the initial total live biomass, initial active fraction,
the maximum specific growth and maintenance rates, and the half-saturation
constant. Our new model can be incorporated into existing ecosystem models to
account for dormancy in microbially-mediated processes and to provide improved
estimates of microbial activities.

the size of biomolecules of structural interest decreases. When the image
contrast falls into a range where the location or presence of single particles
becomes ambiguous, a need arises for objective computational approaches to
detect weak signal and to select and verify particles from these low-contrast
micrographs. Here we propose an objective validation scheme for low-contrast
particle selection using a combination of two different target functions. In an
implementation of this dual-target function (DTF) validation, a first target
function of fast local correlation was used to select particles through
template matching, followed by signal validation through a second target
function of maximum likelihood. By a systematic study of simulated data, we
found that such an implementation of DTF validation is capable of selecting and
verifying particles from cryo-EM micrographs with a signal-to-noise ratio as
low as 0.002. Importantly, we demonstrated that DTF validation can robustly
evade over-fitting or reference bias from the particle-picking template,
allowing true signal to emerge from amidst heavy noise in an objective fashion.
The DTF approach allows efficient assembly of a large number of single-particle
cryo-EM images of smaller biomolecules or specimens containing
contrast-degrading agents like detergents in a semi-automatic manner.

evolution identified by Henrich, Boyd, and Richerson (2008). First, cultural
representations are neither discrete nor continuous; they are distributed
across neurons that respond to microfeatures. This enables associations to be
made, and cultural change to be generated. Second, 'replicator dynamics' do not
ensure natural selection. The replicator notion does not capture the
distinction between actively interpreted self-assembly code and passively
copied self-description, which leads to a fundamental principle of natural
selection: inherited information is transmitted, whereas acquired information
is not. Third, this principle is violated in culture by the ubiquity of
acquired change. Moreover, biased transmission is less important to culture
than the creative processes by which novelty is generated. Fourth, there is no
objective basis for determining cultural fitness. Fifth, the necessity of
randomness is discussed. It is concluded that natural selection is
inappropriate as an explanatory framework for culture.

was completed in 2005 and reported a result of $\tau_n = (886.3 \pm 1.2
[\textrm{stat}] \pm 3.2 [\textrm{syst}])$ s. The dominant uncertainties were
attributed to the absolute determination of the fluence of the neutron beam
(2.7 s). The fluence was measured with a neutron monitor that counted the
neutron-induced charged particles from absorption in a thin, well-characterized
6Li deposit. The detection efficiency of the monitor was calculated from the
areal density of the deposit, the detector solid angle, and the evaluated
nuclear data file, ENDF/B-VI 6Li(n,t)4He thermal neutron cross section. In the
current work, we have measured the detection efficiency of the same monitor
used in the neutron lifetime measurement with a second, totally-absorbing
neutron detector. This direct approach does not rely on the 6Li(n,t)4He cross
section or any other nuclear data. The detection efficiency is consistent with
the value used in 2005 but was measured with a precision of 0.057 %, which
represents a five-fold improvement in the uncertainty. We have verified the
temporal stability of the neutron monitor through ancillary measurements,
allowing us to apply the measured neutron monitor efficiency to the lifetime
result from the 2005 experiment. The updated lifetime is $\tau_n = (887.7 \pm
1.2 [\textrm{stat}] \pm 1.9 [\textrm{syst}])$ s.

flavor evolution with an effective mass when inelastic scattering is

collision term in the Boltzmann equation when scattering is dominant and the

a new dynamical quantity related to neutrino spin. This quantity decouples from
the equations of motion for the density matrices at low densities or in

possibility of coherent transformation between neutrinos and antineutrinos at

without using SN spectral or photometric data. Unlike all previous studies to
classify SNe without spectra, this technique does not use any SN photometry.
Instead, the method relies on host-galaxy data. We build upon the well-known
correlations between SN classes and host-galaxy properties, specifically that
core-collapse SNe rarely occur in red, luminous, or early-type galaxies. Using
the nearly spectroscopically complete Lick Observatory Supernova Search sample
of SNe, we determine SN fractions as a function of host-galaxy properties.
Using these data as inputs, we construct a Bayesian method for determining the
probability that a SN is of a particular class. This method improves a common
classification figure of merit by a factor of >2, comparable to the best
light-curve classification techniques. Of the galaxy properties examined,
morphology provides the most discriminating information. We further validate
this method using SN samples from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Palomar
Transient Factory. We demonstrate that this method has wide-ranging
applications, including separating different subclasses of SNe and determining
the probability that a SN is of a particular class before photometry or even
spectra can. Since this method uses completely independent data from
light-curve techniques, there is potential to further improve the overall
purity and completeness of SN samples and to test systematic biases of the
light-curve techniques. Further enhancements to the host-galaxy method,
including additional host-galaxy properties, combination with light-curve
methods, and hybrid methods should further improve the quality of SN samples
from past, current, and future transient surveys.

consequences of bar formation and evolution on the M-sigma relation of
supermassive black holes. The redistribution of angular momentum driven by bars
leads to a mass increase within the central region, raising the velocity
dispersion of the bulge, sigma, on average by ~12% and as much as ~20%. If a
disc galaxy with a SMBH satisfying the M-sigma relation forms a bar, and the
SMBH does not grow in the process, then the increase in sigma moves the galaxy
off the M-sigma relation. We explore various effects that can affect this
result including contamination from the disc and anisotropy. The displacement
from the M-sigma relation for individual model barred galaxies correlates with
both M(B)/M(B+D) and beta_phi(B+D) measured within the effective radius of the
bulge. Overall, this process leads to an M-sigma for barred galaxies offset
from that of unbarred galaxies, as well as an increase in its scatter. We
assemble samples of unbarred and barred galaxies with classical bulges and find
tentative hints of an offset between the two consistent with the predicted.
Including all barred galaxies, rather than just those with a classical bulge,

them the mixing at shear flow interfaces due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability (KHI). The observed structure of potential mixing layers can be
used to infer the transport coefficients, but the data interpretation requires
a detailed knowledge of the long-term evolution of the KHI under different
conditions. Here we present the first systematic numerical study of the effect
of constant and temperature-dependent isotropic viscosity over the full range
of possible values. We show that moderate viscosities slow down the growth of
the KHI and reduce the height of the KHI rolls and their rolling-up.
Viscosities above a critical value suppress the KHI. The effect can be
quantified in terms of the Reynolds number Re = U{\lambda}/{\nu}, where U is
the shear velocity, {\lambda} the perturbation length, and {\nu} the kinematic
viscosity. We derive the critical Re for constant and temperature dependent,
Spitzer-like viscosities, an empirical relation for the viscous KHI growth time
as a function of Re and density contrast, and describe special behaviours for
Spitzer-like viscosities and high density contrasts. Finally, we briefly
discuss several astrophysical situations where the viscous KHI could play a
role, i.e., sloshing cold fronts, gas stripping from galaxies, buoyant
cavities, ICM turbulence, and high velocity clouds.

searches based on rotational spectroscopy have only targeted the bowl-shaped

a ""comb"" of evenly spaced stacks of lines. The simple pattern of these ""comb""

of cold dark matter cosmological models. Given the importance of this test it
is essential to ensure that galaxies acting as strong lenses have dark and
luminous satellites which are representative of the overall galaxy population.
We address this issue by measuring the number and spatial distribution of
luminous satellites in ACS imaging around lens galaxies from the Sloan Lens
Advanced Camera for Surveys (SLACS) lenses, and comparing them with the
satellite population in ACS imaging of non lens galaxies selected from COSMOS,
which has similar depth and resolution to the ACS images of SLACS lenses. In
order to compare the samples of lens and non lens galaxies, which have
intrinsically different stellar mass distributions, we measure, for the first
time, the number of satellites per host as a continuous function of host
stellar mass for both populations. We find that the number of satellites as a
function of host stellar mass, as well as the spatial distribution are
consistent between the samples. Using these results, we predict the number of
satellites we would expect to find around a subset of the Cosmic Lens All Sky
Survey (CLASS) lenses, and find a result consistent with the the number
observed by Jackson et al. 2010. Thus we conclude that within our measurement
uncertainties there is no significant difference in the satellite populations
of lens and non lens galaxies.

information theory and quantum communication complexity, and it will be of
importance for eventual real-world applications of interactive quantum
protocols, which can be proved to have exponentially lower communication costs
than their classical counterparts for some problems. These are the first
results concerning the quantum version of this problem, originally studied by
Schulman in a classical setting (FOCS '92, STOC '93). We simulate a length $N$
quantum communication protocol by a length $O(N)$ protocol with arbitrarily
small error. Under adversarial noise, our strategy can withstand, for
arbitrarily small $\epsilon > 0$, error rates as high as $1/2 -\epsilon$ when
parties pre-share perfect entanglement, but the classical channel is noisy. We
show that this is optimal. We provide extension of these results in several
other models of communication, including when also the entanglement is noisy,
and when there is no pre-shared entanglement but communication is quantum and
noisy. We also study the case of random noise, for which we provide simulation
protocols with positive communication rates and no pre-shared entanglement over
some quantum channels with quantum capacity $C_Q=0$, proving that $C_Q$ is in
general not the right characterization of a channel's capacity for interactive
quantum communication. Our results are stated for a general quantum
communication protocol in which Alice and Bob collaborate, and these results
hold in particular in the quantum communication complexity settings of the Yao

We
argue that a moduli space of solitons survives the addition of both electric

the case of electric impurities, the metric remains unchanged but the dynamics
is accompanied by a connection term, acting as an effective magnetic field over
the moduli space. We give an expression for this connection and compute the
vortex-impurity bound states in simple cases. In contrast, magnetic impurities
distort the metric on the moduli space. We show that magnetic impurities can be
viewed as vortices associated to a second, frozen, gauge group. We provide a

20a is composed of two nearly identical Wolf- Rayet stars of 82 and 83 solar
masses orbiting with a period of only 3.7 days. Although Chandra observations
were taken during the secondary optical eclipse, the X-ray light curve shows no
signs of a flux decrement. In fact, WR 20a appears slightly more X-ray luminous
and softer during the optical eclipse, opposite to what has been observed in
other binary systems. To aid in our interpretation of the data, we compare with
the results of hydrodynamical simulations using the adaptive mesh refinement
code Mezcal that includes radiative cooling and a radiative acceleration force

models where the wind-wind collision interface in this system occurs while the
outflowing material is still being accelerated. Consequently, WR 20a serves as
a critical test-case for how radiatively-driven stellar winds initiate and

reducible. The basis vectors of the O(2l+1) supset O(2l-1) x U(1) can easily be

with no boson pairs, from which one can construct symmetric irreducible
representations of O(2l+1) in the O(2l-1) x U(1) basis when all symmetric
irreducible representations of O(2l-1) are known. As a starting point, basis
vectors of symmetric irreducible representations of O(5) are constructed in the

determine the basis vectors of O(5) supset O(3). Formulae for evaluating the

provenance all ""bad moves"", i.e., those which unnecessarily allow the opponent
to improve the outcome of a play. In this way, the value of a position is
determined by its game provenance. We then define provenance games by viewing
the evaluation of a first-order query as a game between two players who argue
whether a tuple is in the query answer. For RA+ queries, we show that game
provenance is equivalent to the most general semiring of provenance polynomials
N[X]. Variants of our game yield other known semirings. However, unlike
semiring provenance, game provenance also provides a ""built-in"" way to handle
negation and thus to answer why-not questions: In (provenance) games, the
reason why x is not won, is the same as why x is lost or drawn (the latter is
possible for games with draws). Since first-order provenance games are
draw-free, they yield a new provenance model that combines how- and why-not
provenance.

introducing a contribution to the action defined at an initial-time boundary.
The propagator for this theory is composed of two parts, one associated with
the free propagation of fields and another produced by the operators of this
initial action. The derivation of this propagator is shown for the case of a
translationally and rotationally invariant initial state. In addition to being
able to treat more general states, these techniques can also be applied to
effective field theories that start from an initial time. The eigenstates of a
theory with interacting heavy and light fields are different from the
eigenstates of the theory in the limit where the interactions vanish.
Therefore, a product of states of the noninteracting heavy and light theories
will usually contain excitations of the heavier state once the interactions are
included. Such excitations appear as nonlocal effects in the effective theory,
which are suppressed by powers of the mass of the heavy field. By appropriately
choosing the initial action, these excitations can be excised from the state
leaving just effects that would be produced by a local action of the lighter

upon crowding. Here, we explore packing as a function of shape. By combining
simulations and analytic calculations, we study three 2-parameter families of
hard polyhedra and report an extensive and systematic analysis of the densest

interpolate between various symmetric solids (Platonic, Archimedean, Catalan).
We find that optimal (maximum) packing density surfaces that reveal unexpected

a single family. Our results demonstrate the utility of thinking of shape not
as a static property of an object in the context of packings, but rather as but
one point in a higher dimensional shape space whose neighbors in that space may
have identical or markedly different packings. Finally, we present and
interpret our packing results in a consistent and generally applicable way by
proposing a method to distinguish regions of packings and classify types of

mimics the dynamics of charged particles in an effective magnetic field. Here,
we consider adiabatic motion of atoms in the presence of an evanescent wave.
Theoretical description of the adiabatic motion involves artificial vector and
scalar potentials related to the Berry phases. Due to the large gradient of the
evanescent field amplitude, the potentials can be strong enough to induce
measurable effects in cold atomic gases. We show that the resulting artificial
magnetic field is able to induce vortices in a Bose-Einstein condensate trapped
close to a surface of a prism where the evanescent wave is created. We also
analyze motion of an atomic cloud released from a magneto-optical trap that
falls down on the surface of the prism. The artificial magnetic field is able

signals compressible with respect to an orthonormal basis. However, modern
applications have sparked the emergence of approaches for signals not sparse in
an orthonormal basis but in some arbitrary, perhaps highly overcomplete,

to address signal recovery in this setting. However, such methods inherently
rely on the existence of fast and accurate projections which allow one to
identify the most relevant atoms in a dictionary for any given signal, up to a
very strict accuracy. When the dictionary is highly overcomplete, no such
projections are currently known; the requirements on such projections do not
even hold for incoherent or well-behaved dictionaries. In this work, we provide
an alternate analysis for signal space greedy methods which enforce assumptions
on these projections which hold in several settings including those when the
dictionary is incoherent or structurally coherent. These results align more
closely with traditional results in the standard CoSa literature and improve
upon previous work in the signal space setting.

In order to reduce
ambiguity in the transmission of information, agreement on a set of conventions

particular linguistic variants associated with the social groups they identify
with. The influence of other groups propagating across the speech community as
new variant forms sustains the competition between linguistic variants. With
the utterance selection model, an evolutionary description of language change,
Baxter et al. [Phys. Rev. E 73, 046118 (2006)] have provided a mathematical
formulation of the interactions inside a group of speakers, exploring the
mechanisms that lead to or inhibit the fixation of linguistic variants. In this
paper, we take the utterance selection model one step further by describing a
speech community consisting of multiple interacting groups. Tuning the
interaction strength between groups allows us to gain deeper understanding
about the way in which linguistic variants propagate and how their distribution
depends on the group partitioning. Both for the group size and the number of
groups we find scaling behaviors with two asymptotic regimes. If groups are
strongly connected, the dynamics is that of the standard utterance selection
model, whereas if their coupling is weak, the magnitude of the latter along
with the system size governs the way consensus is reached. Furthermore, we find
that a high influence of the interlocutor on a speaker's utterances can act as
a counterweight to group segregation.

physical systems being appropriately described by the TB model can exhibit the
main strongly correlated electron system (SCES) properties, when they are
solved in the HF approximation, by also allowing crystal symmetry breaking
effects and non-collinear spin orientations of the HF orbitals. It is argued
how a simple 2D square lattice system of Coulomb interacting electrons can
exhibit insulator gaps and pseudogap states, and quantum phase transitions as
illustrated by the mentioned former works. A discussion is also presented here
indicating the possibility of attaining room temperature superconductivity, by
means of a surface coating with water molecules of cleaved planes of graphite,
being orthogonal to its c-axis. The possibility that 2D arrays of quantum dots
can give rise to the same effect is also proposed to consideration. The
analysis also furnishes theoretical insight to solve the Mott-Slater debate, at
least for the La2CuO4 and TMO band structures. The idea is to apply a properly
non-collinear GW scheme to the electronic structure calculation of these
materials. The fact is that the GW approach can be viewed as a HF procedure in
which the screening polarization is also determined. This directly indicates
the possibility of predicting the assumed dielectric constant in the previous
works. Thus, the results seem to identify that the main correlation properties
in these materials are determined by screening. Finally, the conclusions also

anesthesia. Their efficacy as anesthetics has been shown to correlate both with
their affinity for a hydrophobic environment and with their potency in
inhibiting certain ligand gated ion channels. Here we explore the effects that
n-alcohols and other liquid anesthetics have on the two-dimensional miscibility
critical point observed in cell derived giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs).
We show that anesthetics depress the critical temperature (Tc) of these GPMVs
without strongly altering the ratio of the two liquid phases found below Tc.
The magnitude of this affect is consistent across n-alcohols when their
concentration is rescaled by the median anesthetic concentration (AC50) for
tadpole anesthesia, but not when plotted against the overall concentration in
solution. At AC50 we see a 4{\deg}C downward shift in Tc, much larger than is

GPMV miscibility critical temperatures are also lowered to a similar extent by
propofol, phenylethanol, and isopropanol when added at anesthetic
concentrations, but not by tetradecanol or 2,6 diterbutylphenol, two structural
analogs of general anesthetics that are hydrophobic but have no anesthetic
potency. We propose that liquid general anesthetics provide an experimental
tool for lowering critical temperatures in plasma membranes of intact cells,
which we predict will reduce lipid-mediated heterogeneity in a way that is
complimentary to increasing or decreasing cholesterol. Also, several possible
implications of our results are discussed in the context of current models of
anesthetic action on ligand gated ion channels.

we have generated ice sublimation models consistent with the photometric light

management and national security applications. This paper proposes a
conflict-based path-generation approach for evacuation planning. Its key idea
is to generate evacuation routes lazily for evacuated areas and to optimize the
evacuation over these routes in a master problem. Each new path is generated to
remedy conflicts in the evacuation and adds new columns and a new row in the
master problem. The algorithm is applied to massive flood scenarios in the
Hawkesbury-Nepean river (West Sydney, Australia) which require evacuating in
the order of 70,000 persons. The proposed approach reduces the number of
variables from 4,500,000 in a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) formulation to
30,000 in the case study. With this approach, realistic evacuations scenarios
can be solved near-optimally in real time, supporting both evacuation planning
in strategic, tactical, and operational environments.

correlation functions not to the state and detection of a photon at Bob does
not mean key bit. These make the scheme robust against intercept-resend attack
because Alice and Bob can always check the errors in their measurements and
reveal the presence of Eve in their channel without leaking any key bit

The scheme is strictly relied on the perfect beam splitter and mean photon

introduce more errors in Bob even without the presence of Eve. From the

code constructions that trade storage capacity for perfect security. In other
words, by decreasing the amount of original data that it can store, the system
can guarantee that the adversary, which eavesdrops up to a certain number of
storage nodes, obtains no information (in Shannon's sense) about the original

investigate minimum bandwidth regenerating (MBR) codes that are block secure
against adversaries of varied eavesdropping strengths. Such MBR codes guarantee
that no information about any group of original data units up to a certain size
is revealed, without sacrificing the storage capacity of the system. The size
of such secure groups varies according to the number of nodes that the
adversary can eavesdrop. We show that code constructions based on Cauchy

based on Vandermonde matrices.

formation is dominated by repulsive electron-electron interactions, so that the

on-site, repulsive electron-electron interactions that are the proximate cause
of such superconductivity are more typically drivers of commensurate magnetism.
Indeed, it is the suppression of commensurate antiferromagnetism (AF) that
usually allows this type of unconventional superconductivity to emerge.
Importantly, however, intervening between these AF and SC phases, intertwined

For this reason, it has been extremely difficult to distinguish the microscopic

lift generation are intriguing. The rectangular flat-plate flapping wing with a
sinusoidally stretching and retracting wingspan is proposed as a simple model
of biologically-inspired dynamic morphing wings. Direct numerical simulations
of the low-Reynolds-number flows around the flapping morphing wing in a
parametric space are conducted by using immersed boundary method. It is found
that the instantaneous and time-averaged lift coefficients of the wing can be
significantly enhanced by dynamically changing wingspan in a flapping cycle.
The lift enhancement is caused not only by changing the lifting surface area,
but also manipulating the flow structures that are responsible to the
generation of the vortex lift. The physical mechanisms behind the lift
enhancement are explored by examining the three-dimensional flow structures
around the flapping wing.

Buchbinder et al., 2013 and design a modification that improves the
approximation to (3+sqrt(5))/4 (approximately 1.309017). We also present a
tight example showing that this is the best approximation one can achieve with
the type of cuts considered by Buchbinder et al., 2013: (1) partitioning by
exponential clocks, and (2) single-coordinate cuts with equal thresholds.
  Then, we prove that this factor can be improved by introducing a new rounding
scheme: (3) single-coordinate cuts with descending thresholds. By combining
these three schemes, we design an algorithm that achieves a factor of (10 + 4
sqrt(3))/13 (approximately 1.30217). This is the best approximation factor that
we are able to verify by hand.
  Finally, we show that by combining these three rounding schemes with the

eternal inflation is an open problem whose resolution is important to gain

the future evolution, an anti-deSitter bubble universe does not encounter a big

systems in one dimension where particles evolve as individual Bessel processes

this family on its two main parameters: the inverse temperature beta and the
Bessel index nu. We obtain the time-scaled steady-state distributions of the
processes for the cases where beta or nu are large but finite. In particular,
for large beta we show that the steady-state distribution of the system
corresponds to the eigenvalue distribution of the beta-Laguerre ensembles of
random matrices. We also estimate the relaxation time to the steady state in
both cases. We find that in the freezing regime beta->infinity, the scaled
final positions of the particles are locked at the square root of the zeroes of
the Laguerre polynomial of parameter nu-1/2 for any initial configuration,
while in the regime nu->infinity, we prove that the scaled final positions of
the particles converge to a single point. In order to obtain our results, we
use the theory of Dunkl operators, in particular the intertwining operator of
type B. We derive a previously unknown expression for this operator and study
its behaviour in both limiting regimes. By using these limiting forms of the
intertwining operator, we derive the steady-state distributions, the
estimations of the relaxation times and the limiting behaviour of the

  MIMO Networks",,,,,"cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  Concurrent link communications built on multi-antenna systems have been
widely adopted for spatial resource exploitation. MIMA-MAC, a classical MIMO
MAC protocol utilizing concurrent link scheme, is able to provide superior link
throughput over conventional single link MAC (under certain isolated link
topologies). However, when utilizing rich link adaptation functions in MIMO
systems, there exists a non-ignorable probability that MIMA-MAC's throughput
will be lower than that of single link scheme (such probability is dominated by
the statistics of instantaneous link topology and channel response). Inspired
by this critical observation, and for adapting to various link topologies, this
paper will present a novel MAC design that can adaptively switch between single
or concurrent link scheme. With the aim of absolutely outperforming the single
link MAC, here our optimization criterion is to guarantee a throughput result
that is either better than or at least equal to single link MAC's counterpart.
To highlight the design rationale, we first present an idealized implementation
having network information perfectly known in a non-causal way. Then for
realistic applications, we further develop a practical MAC implementation
dealing with realistic system impairments (distributed handshaking and
imperfect channel estimation). Simulation results validate that link throughput
in our MAC is higher than or equal to single link MAC's counterpart with
minimized outage probabilities. And for ergodic link throughput, our proposed
MAC can outperform the single link MAC and MIMA-MAC by around 20{%}-30{%}.

Rayleigh damping models lack physical consistency and that, in turn, it must be

of artificial damping. There are concerns raised by the mass proportional part
of Rayleigh damping, but they are not considered in this paper. As far as the
stiffness proportional part of Rayleigh damping is concerned, either the
initial structural stiffness or the updated tangent stiffness can be used. The
objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive comparison of these two

ratios throughout the time history analysis are developed; a simple example is

voltage - is a counter-intuitive effect that is observed in various molecular
junctions. Here, we present a novel mechanism that may be responsible for such
an effect, based on strong Coulomb interaction between electrons in the
molecule and electrons on the atoms closest to the molecule. The Coulomb
interaction induces electron-hole binding across the molecule-electrode
interface, resulting in a renormalized and enhanced molecule-electrode
coupling. Using a self-consistent non-equilibrium Green's function approach, we
show that the effective coupling is non-monotonic in bias voltage, leading to
negative differential resistance. The model is in accord with recent
experimental observations that showed a correlation between the negative
differential resistance and the coupling strength. We provide detailed
suggestions for experimental tests which may help to shed light on the origin
of the negative differential resistance. Finally, we demonstrate that the
interface Coulomb interaction affects not only the I-V curves but also the
thermoelectric properties of molecular junctions.

initial conditions in a family of scale-free EdS models, characterized by a
free parameter $\kappa$ fixing the ratio between the mass driving the expansion
and the mass which clusters. As in the ""usual"" EdS model, corresponding to
$\kappa=1$, self-similarity provides a powerful instrument to delimit the
physically relevant clustering resolved by a simulation. Likewise, if stable
clustering applies, it implies scale-free non-linear clustering. We derive the
corresponding exponent $\gamma_{sc} (n, \kappa)$ of the two point correlation
function. We then report the results of extensive N-body simulations, of
comparable size to those previously reported in the literature for the case
$\kappa=1$, and performed with an appropriate modification of the GADGET2 code.
We observe in all cases self-similarity in the two point correlations, down to
a lower cut-off which decreases monotonically in time in comoving coordinates.
The self-similar part of the non-linear correlation function is fitted well in
all cases by a single power-law with an exponent in good agreement with
$\gamma_{sc} (n, \kappa)$. Our results thus indicate that stable clustering
provides an excellent approximation to the non-linear correlation function over
the resolved self-similar scales, at least down to $\gamma_{sc} (n, \kappa)
\approx 1$, corresponding to the case $n=-2$ for $\kappa=1$. We conclude, in
contrast notably with the results of Smith et al. (2003), that a clear
identification of the breakdown of stable clustering in self-similar models -
and the possible existence of a ""universal"" region in which non-linear
clustering becomes independent of initial conditions - remains an important
open problem, which should be addressed further in significantly larger

  http://www.academia.edu/2402713",,,,"physics.hist-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The traditional date of 1595 BCE for the destruction of Babylon by the
Hittite king Mursili I is accepted by most historians for many years despite
notable controversies. This pivotal date is considered crucial to the various
calculations of the early chronology of the ancient Near East. According to the
Venus Tablet (Enuma Anu Enlil 63) which describes the rising and setting of
Venus during the reign of Ammisaduqa, there are only 4 possibilities implying 4
dates for the destruction of Ur (1912, 1944, 2004, 2064 BCE) but a tablet of
astronomical omens (Enuma Anu Enlil 20,21) mentions a lunar eclipse, dated
14/III/48, at the end of the reign of Shulgi and a lunar eclipse, dated
14/XII/24, at the end of the reign of Ibbi-Sin. Over the period 2200-1850 BCE
there are only 3 pairs of eclipses, spaced by 42 years, matching the
description of astronomical omens but only 1 agreeing with the previous 4
dates. The second way to check the date for the fall of Babylon is to rebuild
the chronology of this period thanks to synchronisms dated by astronomy from
Assyrian, Babylonian, Egyptian and Israelite chronologies which provide
synchronisms that can be dated independently. The Mesopotamian chronology of
this period is reconstructed using the number of Assyrian eponyms (1 a year)
and the length of Babylonian reigns combined with the set of synchronisms among
Assyrian and Babylonian kings in Annals. During the reign of Assur-dan I
(1179-1133) eponyms began on 1 Nisan instead of 1 Sippu, but Assyrian lunar
years without intercalation remained the norm until Tiglath-pileser I. As the
Babylonian year began on 1st Nisan (just after the spring equinox), Assyrian
years coincided with Babylonian lunar years with intercalation, thus the period
between Assur-dan I and Tiglath-pileser I was therefore transitional. Owing to
the Babylonian chronology and synchronisms it is possible to date other
chronologies.

that the Cotton-York tensor encodes contributions from both electric, magnetic
part of the Weyl tensor and in directly from the shear tensor. In our opinion,
this makes the Cotton-York tensor arguably the natural choice for linear
gravitational waves in the 1+3 covariant formalism. The tensor is cumbersome to
work with but that should negate its usefulness. It is conceivable that the
tensor would equally be useful in the metric approach, although we have not
demonstrated this in the current study. We contend that the use of only one of
the Weyl tensor or the shear tensor, although phenomenologically correct, leads
to loss of information. Such information is vital particularly when examining
the contribution of gravitational waves to the anisotropy of an almost
-Friedmann-Lamitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe. The recourse to this loss
is the use Cotton-York tensor.

of the universal construction to the clients, and solely implement a
distributed shared atomic memory at the servers side. The construction we
propose is obstruction-free. It can be implemented in a purely asynchronous
manner, and it does not assume the knowledge of the participants. It is built
on top of grafarius and racing objects, two novel shared abstractions that we

gamma-ray emission in Active Galactic Nuclei. Contrary to pre-Fermi ideas, BL
Lac objects are found to be the most abundant emitters in the gamma-ray band.
However, since they are relatively weak radio sources, most of their
parsec-scale structure and their multi-frequency properties are poorly
understood and/or have not been investigated in a systematically fashion. Aims.
Our main goal is to analyze the radio and gamma-ray emission properties of a
sample of 42 BL Lacs selected, for the first time in the literature, with no
constraint on their radio and gamma-ray flux densities/emission. Methods.
Thanks to new Very Long Baseline Array observations at 8 and 15 GHz for the
whole sample, we present here fundamental parameters such as radio flux
densities, spectral index information, and parsec-scale structure. Moreover, we
search for gamma-ray counterparts using data reported in the Second Catalog of
Fermi Gamma-ray sources. Results. Parsec-scale radio emission is observed in
the majority of the sources at both frequencies. Gamma-ray counterparts are
found for 14/42 sources. Conclusions. The comparison between our results in
radio and gamma-ray bands points out the presence of a large number of faint BL
Lacs showing ""non classical"" properties such as low source compactness, core
dominance, no gamma-ray emission and steep radio spectral indexes. A deeper
multiwavelength analysis will be needed.

obtain the regions of the parameter space that are compatible with the dark
matter constraint. We demonstrate that the observed dark matter abundance can
be explained via freeze-in over a wide range of masses extending down to the
keV range. As a result, warm and cold dark matter can be obtained in this
model. It is also possible to have dark matter masses well above the unitarity

simultaneously: metal-poor gas is accreted, is chemically enriched by dying

stars are formed on nearly circular orbits in the equatorial plane and then
diffuse through orbit space to eccentric and inclined orbits; the central
stellar bar surrenders angular momentum to the surrounding disc and dark halo
while acquiring angular momentum from inspiralling gas; the outer parts of the
disc are constantly disturbed by satellite objects, both luminous and dark, as
they sweep through pericentre. We review the conceptual tools required to bring
these complex happenings into focus. Our first concern must be the construction
of equilibrium models of the Galaxy, for upon these hang our hopes of
determining the Galaxy's mean gravitational field, which is required for every
subsequent step. Ideally our equilibrium model should be formulated so that the
secular evolution of the system can be modelled with perturbation theory. Such
theory can be used to understand how stars diffuse through orbit space from
either the thin gas disc in which we presume disc stars formed, or the debris
of an accreted object, the presumed origin of many halo stars. Coupling this
understanding to the still very uncertain predictions of the theory of stellar
evolution and nucleosynthesis, we can finally extract a complete model of the

relation of such a model to cosmological simulations of galaxy formation, which

Several extra-tidal dwarf cepheids were found in our survey up to a distance of
~1 degree from the center of Carina. Our sample also includes RR Lyrae stars

tidal disruption. We use the period-luminosity relationship for dwarf Cepheids

be one of the processes responsible for large scale magnetic structure
formation in astrophysical systems. In this work we present an exhaustive set
of high resolution direct numerical simulations (DNS) of both forced and
decaying 3D-MHD turbulence, to understand this structure formation process. It
is first shown that an inverse cascade of magnetic helicity in small-scale
driven turbulence does not necessarily generate coherent large-scale magnetic
structures. The observed large-scale magnetic field, in this case, is severely
perturbed by magnetic fluctuations generated by the small-scale forcing. In the
decaying case, coherent large-scale structure form similar to those observed
astronomically. Based on the numerical results the formation of large-scale
magnetic structures in some astrophysical systems, is suggested to be the
consequence of an initial forcing which imparts the necessary turbulent energy
into the system, which, after the forcing shuts off, decays to form the
large-scale structures. This idea is supported by representative examples e.g.
cluster of galaxies.

only small differences between the quantum and the classical transport

number of bonds is needed in the CTQW case than in the CTRW case. While for
CTRW the number of bonds needed decreases when going from small AR to large AR,
for CTRW this number is large for small AR, has a minimum for the square
configuration, and increases again for increasing AR. We corroborate our
findings for large AR by showing that the corresponding quantum eigenstates are
strongly localized in situations in which the transport is facilitated in the

motility assays. The properties of such systems depend both on their
dimensionality and the interactions between their particles. We introduce a
model for self-propelled rods in two dimensions that interact via a
separation-shifted Lennard-Jones potential. Due to the finite potential
barrier, the rods are able to cross. This model allows us to efficiently
simulate systems of self-propelled rods that effectively move in two dimensions
but can occasionally escape to the third dimension in order to pass each other.
Our quasi-two-dimensional self-propelled particles describe a class of active
systems that encompasses microswimmers close to a wall and filaments propelled
on a substrate. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we first determine the
isotropic-nematic transition for passive rods. Using Brownian dynamics
simulations, we characterize cluster formation of self-propelled rods as a
function of propulsion strength, noise, and energy barrier. Contrary to rods
with an infinite potential barrier, an increase of the propulsion strength does
not only favor alignment but also effectively decreases the potential barrier
that prevents crossing of rods. We thus find a clustering window with a maximum
cluster size at medium propulsion strengths.

dynamo, in which the meridional circulation of the Sun plays an important role.
Most of the kinematic dynamo simulations assume a one-cell structure of the
meridional circulation within the convection zone, with the equatorward return
flow at its bottom. In view of the recent claims that the return flow occurs at
a much shallower depth, we explore whether a meridional circulation with such a
shallow return flow can still retain the attractive features of the flux
transport dynamo (such as a proper butterfly diagram, the proper phase relation
between the toroidal and poloidal fields). We consider additional cells of the
meridional circulation below the shallow return flow---both the case of
multiple cells radially stacked above one another and the case of more
complicated cell patterns. As long as there is an equatorward flow in low
latitudes at the bottom of the convection zone, we find that the solar behavior
is approximately reproduced. However, if there is either no flow or a poleward
flow at the bottom of the convection zone, then we cannot reproduce solar
behavior. On making the turbulent diffusivity low, we still find periodic
behavior, although the period of the cycle becomes unrealistically large. Also,
with a low diffusivity, we do not get the observed correlation between the
polar field at the sunspot minimum and the strength of the next cycle, which is
reproduced when diffusivity is high. On introducing radially downward pumping,
we get a more reasonable period and more solar-like behavior even with low
diffusivity.

investigate the nature of phase transitions as a function of the size of the
system and of the dimension of space in both microcanonical and canonical
ensembles. We consider stable and metastable states and emphasize the
importance of the latter for systems with long-range interactions. For $d\le
2$, there is no phase transition. For $d>2$, phase transitions can take place
between a ""gaseous"" phase unaffected by the exclusion constraint and a
""condensed"" phase dominated by this constraint. The condensed configurations
have a core-halo structure made of a ""rocky core"" surrounded by an
""atmosphere"", similar to a giant gaseous planet. For large systems there exist
microcanonical and canonical first order phase transitions. For intermediate
systems, only canonical first order phase transitions are present. For small
systems there is no phase transition at all. As a result, the phase diagram
exhibits two critical points, one in each ensemble. There also exist a region
of negative specific heats and a situation of ensemble inequivalence for
sufficiently large systems. By a proper interpretation of the parameters, our

non-singular bounces. Here we explore possible dynamics of such bounces using a
simple modification of the Friedmann equation, which ensures that the scale
factor bounces when the matter density reaches some critical value $\rho_c$.
This is combined with a simple scalar field `landscape', where the energy
barriers between different vacua are small compared to $\rho_c$. We find that
the bounce typically results in a transition to another vacuum, with a scalar
field displacement $\Delta\phi \sim 1$ in Planck units. If the new vacuum is
AdS, we have another bounce, and so on, until the field finally transits to a
positive-energy (de Sitter) vacuum. We also consider perturbations about the
homogeneous solution and discuss some of their amplification mechanisms (e.g.,
tachyonic instability and parametric resonance). For a generic potential, these
mechanisms are much less efficient than in models of slow-roll inflation. But
the amplification may still be strong enough to cause the bubble to fragment

signaling system for its own protection. We investigated the evolutionary
development of predator cue utilization and prey signaling in a digital
predator-prey system in which mimicking prey could evolve to alter their
appearance to resemble poison-free or poisonous prey. In predators, we observed
rapid evolution of cue recognition (i.e. active behavioral responses) when
presented with sufficiently poisonous prey. In addition, active signaling (i.e.
mimicry) evolved in prey under all conditions that led to cue utilization. Thus
we show that despite imperfect and dishonest signaling, given a high cost of
consuming poisonous prey, complex systems of interspecific communication can
evolve via predator cue recognition and prey signal manipulation. This provides
evidence supporting hypotheses that cues may serve as stepping-stones in the
evolution of more advanced communication systems and signals incorporating

EFT method, we describe the near-threshold line shape of the $D^{\ast 0}\bar

as a special case of the following problem. We observe $n$ independent

secretary). In the CSP $p_k=E(I_k)=1/k$ and the last $k$ with $I_k=1$ stands
for the best candidate. The more general problem of stopping on a last ""1"" was
studied by Bruss(2000). In what we will call Weber's problem the variables
$I_k$ can take more than two values and we try to stop on the last occurence of
\textit{one} of these values. Notice that we do not know in advance the value

thermodynamic fluxes and forces can be expressed in a consistent way within the
framework of irreversible thermodynamics. Then the efficiency at maximum power
output for a heat engine, one of key topics in finite-time thermodynamics, is
investigated on the basis of a generic model under the tight-coupling
condition. The corresponding results have the same forms as those of
low-dissipation heat engines [M. Esposito, R. Kawai, K. Lindenberg, and C. Van

two kinds of typical heat engines, such as the low-dissipation heat engine and
the Feynman ratchet, into the present generic model are constructed. The
universal efficiency at maximum power output up to the quadratic order is found
to be valid for a heat engine coupled symmetrically and tightly with two baths.
The concepts of weighted reciprocal of temperature and weighted thermal flux

shed some light on higher order approximation schemes for FBSDEs under

an appropriately tamed version of the explicit Euler scheme enjoys the required
stability property and as a consequence converges. In order to establish
convergence of the several discretizations, we extend the canonical path- and

medical data. In typical healthcare systems, consent is captured by a form that
the patient has to fill in and sign. In e-Health systems, the paper-form
consent is being replaced by the integration of the notion of consent in the
mechanisms that regulate the access to the medical data. This helps in
empowering the patient with the capability of granting and revoking consent in
a more effective manner. However, the process of granting and revoking consent
greatly varies according to the situation in which the patient is. Our main
argument is that such a level of detail is very difficult and error-prone to
capture as a set of authorisation policies. In this paper, we present ACTORS, a
goal-driven approach to manage consent. The main idea behind ACTORS is to
leverage the goal-driven approach of Teleo-Reactive (TR) programming for
managing consent that takes into account changes regarding the domains and
contexts in which the patient is providing her consent.

their analysis remains difficult due to the presence of decimation steps. In
this paper, considering the use of LDGM-based quantizers in a class of
symmetric source coding problems, with the alphabet being either binary or
non-binary, it is proved rigorously that, as long as the degree distribution
satisfies certain conditions that can be evaluated with density evolution (DE),
the belief propagation (BP) marginals used in the decimation step have
vanishing mean-square error compared to the exact marginals when the block
length and iteration count goes to infinity, which potentially allows
near-ideal distortion performances to be achieved. This provides a sound
theoretical basis for the degree distribution optimization methods previously

mesh refinement of accreting planets embedded in protoplanetary disks (PPDs).
The magnetized disk includes Ohmic resistivity that depends on the overlying
mass column, leading to turbulent surface layers and a dead zone near the
midplane. The main results are: (i) The accretion flow in the Hill sphere is
intrinsically 3D for hydrodynamic and MHD models. Net inflow toward the planet
is dominated by high latitude flows. A circumplanetary disk (CPD) forms. Its
midplane flows outward in a pattern whose details differ between models. (ii)
Gap opening magnetically couples and ignites the dead zone near the planet,
leading to stochastic accretion, a quasi-turbulent flow in the Hill sphere and
a CPD whose structure displays high levels of variability. (iii) Advection of
magnetized gas onto the rotating CPD generates helical fields that launch
magnetocentrifugally driven outflows. During one specific epoch a highly
collimated, one-sided jet is observed. (iv) The CPD's surface density
$\sim30{\rm\,g\,cm^{-2}}$, small enough for significant ionization and
turbulence to develop. (v) The accretion rate onto the planet in the MHD
simulation reaches a steady value $8 \times 10^{-3} {\rm M_\oplus yr^{-1}}$,
and is similar in the viscous hydrodynamic runs. Our results suggest that gas
accretion onto a forming giant planet within a magnetized PPD with dead zone
allows rapid growth from Saturnian to Jovian masses. As well as being relevant
for giant planet formation, these results have important implications for the
formation of regular satellites around gas giant planets.

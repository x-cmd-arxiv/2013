late time accelerated expansion of the universe. Chameleons possess the
interesting property that their mass, and hence interaction range, is dependent
on the density of their environment. One very appealing feature of chameleons
is the potential to test a model of dark energy in a laboratory setting. Here
we briefly review two proposed experiments to search for chameleons using
neutron interferometry techniques for the Snowmass 2013 Community Summer Study.

codimension-one routes to creation or destruction of a periodic orbit in a
continuous-time dynamical system. It governs the transition from resting
behaviour to periodic spiking in many class I neurons, for example. Here, as a
first step towards theory of networks of such units the effect of weak coupling
between two systems with a SNIC is analysed. Two crucial parameters of the
coupling are identified, which we call \delta_1 and \delta_2. Global
bifurcation diagrams are obtained here for the ""mutualistic"" case \delta_1
\delta_2 > 0. According to the parameter regime, there may coexist resting and
periodic attractors, and there can be quasiperiodic attractors of torus or
cantorus type, making the behaviour of even such a simple system quite
non-trivial. In a second paper we will analyse the mixed case \delta_1 \delta_2
< 0 and summarise the conclusions of this study.

mainly towards its southwest, where the H2 1-0 S(1) emission peaks. Therefore,
the source was catalogued as the Molecular Hydrogen emission-line object MHO
2429. In order to study the molecular ambient towards this star-forming site,
we observed a region around the aforementioned EGO using the Atacama
Submillimeter Telescope Experiment in the 12CO J=3--2, 13CO J=3--2, HCO+
J=4--3, and CS J=7--6 lines with an angular and spectral resolution of 22"" and
0.11 km s-1, respectively. The observations revealed a molecular clump where
the EGO is embedded at v_LSR ~ 51 km s-1, in coincidence with the velocity of a
Class I 95 GHz methanol maser previously detected. Analyzing the 12CO line we
discovered high velocity molecular gas in the range from 34 to 47 km s-1, most
likely a blueshifted outflow driven by the EGO. The alignment and shape of this
molecular structure coincide with those of the southwest lobe of MHO 2429
mainly between 46 and 47 km s-1, confirming that we are mapping its CO
counterpart. Performing a SED analysis of EGO G35.04-0.47 we found that its
central object should be an intermediate-mass young stellar object accreting
mass at a rate similar to those found in some massive YSOs. We suggest that
this source can become a massive YSO.

corrupted with gross sparse error is known as the robust principal component
analysis (RPCA) and has many applications in computer vision, image processing
and web data ranking. It has been shown that under certain conditions, the
solution to the NP-hard RPCA problem can be obtained by solving a convex
optimization problem, namely the robust principal component pursuit (RPCP).
Moreover, if the observed data matrix has also been corrupted by a dense noise
matrix in addition to gross sparse error, then the stable principal component
pursuit (SPCP) problem is solved to recover the low-rank matrix. In this paper,
we develop efficient algorithms with provable iteration complexity bounds for
solving RPCP and SPCP. Numerical results on problems with millions of variables
and constraints such as foreground extraction from surveillance video, shadow
and specularity removal from face images and video denoising from heavily
corrupted data show that our algorithms are competitive to current

distributed network construction we keep the model minimal in all respects. In
particular, we assume finite-state processes that all begin from the same
initial state and all execute the same protocol (i.e. the system is
homogeneous). Moreover, we assume pairwise interactions between the processes
that are scheduled by an adversary. The only constraint on the adversary
scheduler is that it must be fair. In order to allow processes to construct
networks, we let them activate and deactivate their pairwise connections. When
two processes interact, the protocol takes as input the states of the processes
and the state of the their connection and updates all of them. Initially all
connections are inactive and the goal is for the processes, after interacting
and activating/deactivating connections for a while, to end up with a desired
stable network. We give protocols (optimal in some cases) and lower bounds for
several basic network construction problems such as spanning line, spanning
ring, spanning star, and regular network. We provide proofs of correctness for
all of our protocols and analyze the expected time to convergence of most of
them under a uniform random scheduler that selects the next pair of interacting
processes uniformly at random from all such pairs. Finally, we prove several
universality results by presenting generic protocols that are capable of
simulating a Turing Machine (TM) and exploiting it in order to construct a

benzene on Li(100), allows us to evaluate charge transfer energies, as well as
the spatial distribution of the image charge induced on the metal surface. We
systematically study the energies for charge transfer from the molecule to the
substrate as function of the molecule-substrate distance, and investigate the
effects arising from image charge confinement and local charge neutrality
violation. For benzene on Li(100) we find that the image charge plane is
located at about 1.8 \AA above the Li surface, and that our calculated charge
transfer energies compare perfectly with those obtained with a classical
electrostatic model having the image plane located at the same position. The
methodology outlined here can be applied to study any metal/organic interface
in the weak coupling limit at the computational cost of a total energy
calculation. Most importantly, as the scheme is based on total energies and not
on correcting the Kohn-Sham quasiparticle spectrum, accurate results can be
obtained with local/semi-local exchange and correlation functionals. This
enables a systematic approach to convergence.

bosonic systems is much less studied than those in fermionic systems, such as
superconducting or ferromagnetic phase transitions. Nevertheless, composite
bosons are strongly sensitive to magnetic fields: both their internal structure
and motion as whole particles may be affected. A joint effort of ten
laboratories has been focused on studies of polariton lasers, where
non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensates of bosonic quasiparticles,
exciton-polaritons, may appear or disappear under an effect of applied magnetic
fields. Polariton lasers based on pillar or planar microcavities were excited
both optically and electrically. In all cases a pronounced dependence of the
onset to lasing on the magnetic field has been observed. For the sake of
comparison, photon lasing (lasing by an electron-hole plasma) in the presence
of a magnetic field has been studied on the same samples as polariton lasing.
The threshold to photon lasing is essentially governed by the excitonic Mott
transition which appears to be sensitive to magnetic fields too. All the
observed experimental features are qualitatively described within a uniform
model based on coupled diffusion equations for electrons, holes and excitons
and the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for exciton-polariton condensates. Our
research sheds more light on the physics of non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein

is the open-ended autonomous learning of complex behaviours. Our approach is to
use task-independent, information-driven intrinsic motivation(s) to support
task-dependent learning. The work presented here is a preliminary step in which
we investigate the predictive information (the mutual information of the past
and future of the sensor stream) as an intrinsic drive, ideally supporting any
kind of task acquisition. Previous experiments have shown that the predictive
information (PI) is a good candidate to support autonomous, open-ended learning
of complex behaviours, because a maximisation of the PI corresponds to an
exploration of morphology- and environment-dependent behavioural regularities.
The idea is that these regularities can then be exploited in order to solve any
given task. Three different experiments are presented and their results lead to
the conclusion that the linear combination of the one-step PI with an external
reward function is not generally recommended in an episodic policy gradient
setting. Only for hard tasks a great speed-up can be achieved at the cost of an
asymptotic performance lost.

An optical method is used to obtain the full space-time wave field, and the

nonlinear shift of the dispersion relation is observed. We show that this shift
is due to an additional tension of the sheet induced by the transverse motion
of a fundamental mode of the sheet. When the system is subjected to a random
noise forcing at large scale, a regime of hydro-elastic wave turbulence is
observed with a power-law spectrum of the scale in disagreement with the wave

is well satisfied at each scale of the turbulent cascade as expected

quantum diffusion in the perfect structure without disorder and introduce
simple approximations that allow to treat the effect of disorder. Our results
demonstrate that the standard Bloch-Boltzmann theory is not applicable to these

small band velocities and corrections to quantum diffusion that are not taken

the aft section of a Boeing 747SP aircraft that flies at operational altitudes
between 37,000 and 45,00 feet, above 99% of atmospheric water vapor. During
routine operations, a host of instruments will be available to the astronomical
community including cameras and spectrographs in the near- to far-IR; a sub-mm
heterodyne receiver; and an high-speed occultation imager. One of the
challenges for SOFIA (and all observatories in general) is providing a uniform
set of tools that enable the non-expert General Investigator (GI) to propose,
plan, and obtain observations using a variety of very different instruments in
an easy and seamless manner. The SOFIA Data Cycle System (DCS) is an integrated
set of services and user tools for the SOFIA Science and Mission Operations GI
Program designed to address this challenge. Program activities supported by the
DCS include: proposal preparation and submission by the GI; proposal evaluation
by the telescope allocation committee and observatory staff; Astronomical
Observation Request (AOR) preparation and submission by the GI; observation and
mission planning by observatory staff; data processing and archiving; data
product distribution. In this poster paper we present an overview of the DCS

temporal variability measurements and to imaging, allows a wealth of physical
phenomena in astrophysics to be studied. X-ray polarimetry investigates the
acceleration process, for example, including those typical of magnetic
reconnection in solar flares, but also emission in the strong magnetic fields
of neutron stars and white dwarfs. It detects scattering in asymmetric
structures such as accretion disks and columns, and in the so-called molecular
torus and ionization cones. In addition, it allows fundamental physics in
regimes of gravity and of magnetic field intensity not accessible to
experiments on the Earth to be probed. Finally, models that describe
fundamental interactions (e.g. quantum gravity and the extension of the
Standard Model) can be tested. We describe in this paper the X-ray Imaging
Polarimetry Explorer (XIPE), proposed in June 2012 to the first ESA call for a
small mission with a launch in 2017 but not selected. XIPE is composed of two
out of the three existing JET-X telescopes with two Gas Pixel Detectors (GPD)
filled with a He-DME mixture at their focus and two additional GPDs filled with
pressurized Ar-DME facing the sun. The Minimum Detectable Polarization is 14 %
at 1 mCrab in 10E5 s (2-10 keV) and 0.6 % for an X10 class flare. The Half
Energy Width, measured at PANTER X-ray test facility (MPE, Germany) with JET-X
optics is 24 arcsec. XIPE takes advantage of a low-earth equatorial orbit with
Malindi as down-link station and of a Mission Operation Center (MOC) at INPE

We are interested in the homotopy theory of categories of this type: given a
suitable diagram of model categories M(s) (as s runs through the diagram), we
consider the category of diagrams where the object X(s) at s comes from M(s).
We develop model structures on such categories of diagrams, and Quillen
adjunctions that relate categories based on different diagram shapes.
  Under certain conditions, cellularizations (or right Bousfield localizations)
of these adjunctions induce Quillen equivalences. As an application we show
that a cellularization of a category of modules over a diagram of ring spectra
(or differential graded rings) is Quillen equivalent to modules over the
associated inverse limit of the rings. Another application of the general
machinery here is given in work by the authors on algebraic models of rational
equivariant spectra. Some of this material originally appeared in the preprint

multi-wavelength light curves. 'White' light curves and 29 'spectral' light
curves were extracted for each transit and analysed to refine the system
parameters and produce transmission spectra from 520-930nm in ~14nm bins. The
light curves contain time-varying white noise as well as time-correlated noise,
and we used a Gaussian process model to fit this complex noise model. Common
mode corrections derived from the white light curve fits were applied to the
spectral light curves which significantly improved our precision, reaching
typical uncertainties in the transit depth of ~2x10^-4, corresponding to about
half a pressure scale height. The low resolution transmission spectra are
consistent with a featureless model, and we can confidently rule out broad
features larger than about one scale height. The absence of Na/K wings or
prominent TiO/VO features is most easily explained by grey absorption from
clouds in the upper atmosphere, masking the spectral features. However, we
cannot confidently rule out clear atmosphere models with low abundances (~10^-3
solar) of TiO, VO or even metal hydrides masking the Na and K wings. A smaller
scale height or ionisation could also contribute to muted spectral features,
but alone are unable to to account for the absence of features reported here.

systems, such as cuprate superconductors and deformed graphene. We study the
influence of long-range Coulomb interaction on the physical properties of an
anisotropic graphene by using the renormalization group method and 1/N
expansion, where N is the flavor of Dirac fermions. Our explicit calculations
reveal that the anisotropic fermion velocities flow monotonously to an
isotropic fixed point in the lowest energy limit in clean graphene. We then
incorporate three sorts of disorders, including random chemical potential,
random gauge potential, and random mass, and show that the interplay of Coulomb
interaction and disorders can lead to rich and unusual behaviors. In the
presence of strong Coulomb interaction and a random chemical potential, the
fermion velocities are driven to vanish at low energies and the system turns
out to be an exotic anisotropic insulator. In the presence of Coulomb
interaction and other two types of disorders, the system flows to an isotropic
low-energy fixed point more rapidly than the clean case, and exhibits non-Fermi
liquid behaviors. We also investigate the nonperturbative effects of Coulomb
interaction, focusing on how the dynamical gap is affected by the velocity
anisotropy. It is found that the dynamical gap is enhanced (suppressed) as the
fermion velocities decrease (increase), but is suppressed as the velocity
anisotropy increases.

Furthermore, the performance and convergence of the proposed algorithms are
evaluated empirically using randomly generated UI layout specifications of

contributes about 90% of the total luminosity of 1.1 x 10^13 Lo, which is about
a factor of five higher than previous estimates. The large correction of the
luminosity is due to the anisotropy of the emission of the best fit torus.
Similar corrections may be necessary for other local and high-z analogs. This
correction implies that IRAS 08572+3915 at a redshift of 0.05835 may be the
nearest hyperluminous infrared galaxy and probably the most luminous infrared
galaxy in the local (z < 0.2) Universe. IRAS 08572+3915 shows a low ratio of
[CII] to IR luminosity (log L_[CII]/L_{IR} < -3.8) and a [OI]63um to [CII]158um
line ratio of about 1 that supports the model presented in this letter.

"1309.7009","S. Alireza Banani Dr.","S. Alireza Banani, Raviraj Adve","Analyzing the Reduced Required BS Density due to CoMP in Cellular
  Networks","Accepted for presentation in IEEE Globecom Conf., to be held in
  Atlanta, USA, Dec. 2013. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1302.1592",,"10.1109/GLOCOM.2013.6831371",,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we investigate the benefit of base station (BS) cooperation in
the uplink of coordinated multi-point (CoMP) networks. Our figure of merit is
the required BS density required to meet a chosen rate coverage. Our model
assumes a 2-D network of BSs on a regular hexagonal lattice in which path loss,
lognormal shadowing and Rayleigh fading affect the signal received from users.
Accurate closed-form expressions are first presented for the sum-rate coverage
probability and ergodic sum-rate at each point of the cooperation region. Then,
for a chosen quality of user rate, the required density of BS is derived based
on the minimum value of rate coverage probability in the cooperation region.
The approach guarantees that the achievable rate in the entire coverage region
is above a target rate with chosen probability. The formulation allows
comparison between different orders of BS cooperation, quantifying the reduced
required BS density from higher orders of cooperation.

a co-Higgs bundle, with the twisted endomorphism, or ""Higgs field"", also

that Schwarzenberger bundles give rise to an 8-dimensional moduli space of

triangular motif, the spins may not satisfy simultaneously their interactions
with their neighbors. This phenomenon, called frustration, leads to numerous
energetically equivalent magnetic states (ground states), which results in
exotic states such as spin liquid and spin ice. Here we report an alternative
situation: a system that, classically, is to be a liquid in the clean limit
freezes into a glassy state induced by quantum fluctuations. The case in point
is a frustrated magnet in which spins are arranged in a triangular network of
bi-pyramids. When taking into account quantum corrections, the classical
degeneracy is broken into a set of local minima in a rugged energy landscape,
which are separated by large energy barriers, over a finite number of
degenerate, periodic, ground states. The appearance of large barriers is due to
the absence of local zero-energy modes that are typical in spin-liquid
candidate systems. We establish this by mapping the set of local energy minima
states into a tiling with colored hexagonal tiles. We show that the system
exhibits a large number of aperiodic tessellations. The configuration entropy
of the local minima is extremely sensitive to boundary conditions, scaling with
the boundary length rather than its volume. The low temperature thermodynamics
is also discussed to compare it with other glassy materials.

propose to use the proton linac of the European Spallation Source currently
under construction in Lund, Sweden to deliver, in parallel with the spallation
neutron production, a very intense, cost effective and high performance
neutrino beam. The baseline program for the European Spallation Source linac is
that it will be fully operational at 5 MW average power by 2022, producing 2
GeV 2.86 ms long proton pulses at a rate of 14 Hz. Our proposal is to upgrade
the linac to 10 MW average power and 28 Hz, producing 14 pulses/s for neutron
production and 14 pulses/s for neutrino production. Furthermore, because of the
high current required in the pulsed neutrino horn, the length of the pulses
used for neutrino production needs to be compressed to a few $\mu$s with the
aid of an accumulator ring. A long baseline experiment using this Super Beam
and a megaton underground Water Cherenkov detector located in existing mines
300-600 km from Lund will make it possible to discover leptonic CP violation at
5 $\sigma$ significance level in up to 50% of the leptonic Dirac CP-violating
phase range. This experiment could also determine the neutrino mass hierarchy
at a significance level of more than 3 $\sigma$ if this issue will not already
have been settled by other experiments by then. The mass hierarchy performance
could be increased by combining the neutrino beam results with those obtained
from atmospheric neutrinos detected by the same large volume detector. This
detector will also be used to measure the proton lifetime, detect cosmological
neutrinos and neutrinos from supernova explosions. Results on the sensitivity
to leptonic CP violation and the neutrino mass hierarchy are presented.

parameters representing skew scattering, side jump and intrinsic contributions
are dramatically enhanced when the ferromagnetic layer is very thin, and they
have clear linear dependences on the reciprocal of ferromagnetic layer
thickness, indicating a powerful influence of Pt/Ferromagnet interface. Further
study on Cu/Co2FeAl and Ta/Co2FeAl bilayers reveals that a simple interface
scattering without intense spin orbit coupling is not sufficient to trigger
such a phenomenon. The proximity effect of spin orbit coupling is thus
suggested to occur at the Pt/Ferromagnet interface, and as a result quite large
anomalous Hall angle (0.036) and Nernst angle (0.23) are confirmed in the

Starting point is a microscopic description of the system in terms of a
many-body quantum master equation, where coherent and driven-dissipative
dynamics occur on an equal footing. An equivalent Keldysh real time functional
integral reformulation opens up the problem to a practical evaluation using the
tools of quantum field theory. In particular, we develop a functional
renormalization group approach to quantitatively explore the universality class
of this stationary non-equilibrium system. Key results comprise the emergence
of an asymptotic thermalization of the distribution function, while manifest
non-equilibrium properties are witnessed in the response properties in terms of
a new, independent critical exponent. Thus the driven-dissipative microscopic
nature is seen to bear observable consequences on the largest length scales.
The absence of two symmetries present in closed equilibrium systems -
underlying particle number conservation and detailed balance, respectively - is
identified as the root of this new non-equilibrium critical behavior. Our
results are relevant for broad ranges of open quantum systems on the interface
of quantum optics and many-body physics, from exciton-polariton condensates to
cold atomic gases.

purely momentum space counterparts of the Wigner distributions -- the
generalized transverse momentum distributions -- that describes the
configuration of an unpolarized quark in a longitudinally polarized nucleon,
can enter the deeply virtual Compton scattering amplitude only through matrix
elements involving a final state interaction. The relevant matrix elements in
turn involve light cone operators projections in the transverse direction, or
they appear in the deeply virtual Compton scattering amplitude at twist three.
Orbital angular momentum or the spin structure of the nucleon was a major
reason for these various distributions and amplitudes to have been introduced.
We show that twist three contributions to deeply virtual Compton scattering

that, albeit straightforward, the involved calculations are quite long, tedious

use of the renormalization group equations in model building. To that end, we
have developed two completely independent sets of programs written in Python

upcoming release of SARAH 4. The present article describes the collection of
Python routines that we dubbed PyR@TE which is an acronym for ""Python
Renormalization group equations At Two-loop for Everyone"". In PyR@TE, once the
user specifies the gauge group and the particle content of the model, the
routines automatically generate the full two-loop renormalization group
equations for all (dimensionless and dimensionful) parameters. The results can
optionally be exported to Latex and Mathematica, or stored in a Python data
structure for further processing by other programs. For ease of use, we have
implemented an interactive mode for PyR@TE in form of an IPython Notebook. As a
first application, we have generated with PyR@TE the renormalization group
equations for several non-supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model and
found some discrepancies with the existing literature.

defined previously by others, and a new asymmetry parameter, which we define in
this paper. Our asymmetry parameter, which we refer to as photon asymmetry
($A_{phot}), was developed as a robust substructure statistic for cluster
observations with only a few thousand counts. To demonstrate that photon
asymmetry exhibits better stability than currently popular power ratios and
centroid shifts, we artificially degrade the X-ray image quality by: (a) adding
extra background counts, (b) eliminating a fraction of the counts, (c)
increasing the width of the smoothing kernel, and (d) simulating cluster
observations at higher redshift. The asymmetry statistic presented here has a
smaller statistical uncertainty than competing substructure parameters,
allowing for low levels of substructure to be measured with confidence.
A_{phot} is less sensitive to the total number of counts than competing
substructure statistics, making it an ideal candidate for quantifying
substructure in samples of distant clusters covering wide range of
observational S/N. Additionally, we show that the asymmetry-concentration
classification separates relaxed, cool core clusters from
morphologically-disturbed mergers, in agreement with by-eye classifications.
Our algorithms, freely available as Python scripts

rapidly classify galaxy cluster morphology for large numbers of clusters

an artificially red-shifted sample of 114 z < 4 bursts. This is accomplished
using two methods to produce realistic high-z simulations of light curves based

a ~1% probability that the high-z GRB sample is drawn from the same population

suggesting the SNR W49B was a jet-driven SN expanding in a complex CSM, we
explore how the dynamics and the metal distributions in a jet-driven explosion
are modified by the interaction with the surrounding environment. In
particular, we perform hydrodynamical calculations to study the dynamics and
explosive nucleosynthesis of a jet-driven SN triggered by the collapse of a 25
solar masses Wolf-Rayet star and its subsequent interaction with the CSM up to
several hundred years following the explosion. We find that although the CSM
has small-scale effects on the structure of the SNR, the overall morphology and
abundance patterns are reflective of the initial asymmetry of the SN explosion.
Thus, we predict that jet-driven SNRs, such as W49B, should be identifiable

quantum Monte Carlo to benchmark the transition between paramagnetic and
anti-ferromagnetic body centered cubic atomic hydrogen in its ground state. We
locate the density of the transition by computing the equation of state for
these two phases and identify the phase transition order by computing the band
gap near the phase transition. These benchmark results show that the phase
transition is continuous and occurs at a Wigner-Seitz radius of $r_s=2.27(3)
a_0$. We compare our results to previously reported density functional theory,
Hedin's GW approximation, and dynamical mean field theory results.

efficiency with which heat is transported from the interior out to space. The
bottleneck for this transport is at the boundary between the convective
interior and the radiative atmosphere; the opacity there sets the global
cooling rate. Models of planetary evolution are often one-dimensional, such
that the radiative-convective boundary (RCB) is defined by a single
temperature, pressure, and opacity. In reality the spatially inhomogenous
stellar heating pattern and circulation in the atmosphere could deform the RCB,
allowing heat from the interior to escape more efficiently through regions with
lower opacity. We present an analysis of the degree to which the RCB could be
deformed and the resultant change in the evolutionary cooling rate. In this
initial work we calculate the upper limit for this effect by comparing an
atmospheric structure in local radiative equilibrium to its 1D equivalent. We
find that the cooling through an uneven RCB could be enhanced over cooling
through a uniform RCB by as much as 10-50%. We also show that the deformation
of the RCB (and the enhancement of the cooling rate) increases with a greater
incident stellar flux or a lower inner entropy. Our results indicate that this
mechanism could significantly change a planet's thermal evolution, causing it
to cool and shrink more quickly than would otherwise be expected. This may
exacerbate the well known difficulty in explaining the very large radii
observed for some hot Jupiters.

  For the range of initial conditions considered here, our results are
consistent with an universal initial binary fraction \approx 10% (which does
not, however, preclude 100%) and an universal initial stellar mass function
resembling the standard Kroupa distribution. Most of the dispersion observed in
the c-{\alpha} relation can be attributed to two-body relaxation and Galactic
tides. However, dynamical processes alone could not have reproduced the
dispersion in concentration, and we require at least some correlation between
the initial concentration and the total cluster mass. We argue that the origin
of this trend could be connected to the gas-embedded phase of cluster
evolution.

scales in a power-law fashion with the gas density) for four well-studied local
molecular clouds (GMCs). Using the Bayesian methodology we show that a local
Schmidt scaling relation of the form Sigma*(A_K) = kappa x (A_K)^{beta}
(protostars pc^{-2}) exists within (but not between) GMCs. Further we find that
the Schmidt scaling law, by itself, does not provide an adequate description of
star formation activity in GMCs. Because the total number of protostars
produced by a cloud is given by the product of Sigma*(A_K) and S'(> A_K), the
differential surface area distribution function, integrated over the entire
cloud, the cloud's structure plays a fundamental role in setting the level of
its star formation activity. For clouds with similar functional forms of
Sigma*(A_K), observed differences in their total SFRs are primarily due to the
differences in S'(> A_K) between the clouds. The coupling of Sigma*(A_K) with
the measured S'(> A_K) in these clouds also produces a steep jump in the SFR
and protostellar production above A_K ~ 0.8 magnitudes. Finally, we show that
there is no global Schmidt law that relates the star formation rate and gas
mass surface densities between GMCs. Consequently, the observed
Kennicutt-Schmidt scaling relation for disk galaxies is likely an artifact of
unresolved measurements of GMCs and not a result of any underlying physical law
of star formation characterizing the molecular gas.

the neutral hydrogen density field and 21 cm signal in large volumes ($L = 2$
Gpc/$h$). The inclusion of the light cone effect leads to a relative decrease
of about 50% in the 21 cm power spectrum on all scales. We also find that the
effect is more prominent at the midpoint of reionization and later. The light
cone effect also can introduce an anisotropy along the line of sight. By
decomposing the 3D power spectrum into components perpendicular to and along
the line of sight, we find that in our fiducial reionization model, there is no
significant anisotropy. However, parallel modes can contribute up to 40% more
power for shorter reionization scenarios. The scales on which the light cone
effect is relevant are comparable to scales where one measures the baryon
acoustic oscillation. We argue that due to its large comoving scale and

redshift space distortions and future application to the Alcock-Paczynski test

the primordial density perturbations and evolutionary patterns differ from dark
matter halos, N-body simulations and theoretical models have shown that voids
also merge together to form large void structures. In this study, following
Sheth & van de Weygaert (2004), we formulate an analytical approximate
description of the hierarchical void evolution of growing voids by adopting the
halo merging algorithm given by Lacey & Cole (1993) in the Einstein de Sitter
(EdS) Universe. To do this, we take into account the general volume
distribution of voids which consists of two main void processes: merging and
collapsing. We show that the volume distribution function can be reduced to a
simple form, by neglecting the collapsing void contribution since the collapse
process is negligible for large size voids. Therefore, the void volume fraction
has a contribution only from growing voids. This algorithm becomes the analogue
of the halo merging algorithm. Based on this growing void distribution, we
obtain the void merging algorithm in which we define and formulate void merging
and absorption rates, as well as void size and redshift survival probabilities
and also failure rates in terms of the self similar and currently favored dark
energy dominated cold dark matter models in the EdS Universe.

should have the form $\Omega/\Gamma (q)$ with $\Gamma (q) \propto q$ (the
Landau damping). However, the experiments on uranium metallic compounds UGe$_2$
and UCoGe showed that $\Gamma (q)$ tends to a constant value at vanishing $q$.
A non-zero $\Gamma (0)$ is impossible in systems with one type of carriers

It has been conjectured recently that a non-zero $\Gamma (q)$ in UGe$_2$ and
UCoGe may be due to the presence of both localized and itinerant electrons in
these materials, with ferromagnetism involving predominantly localized spins.
We present microscopic analysis of the damping of near-critical localized

the presence of two types of electrons breaks the cancellation between the

angles. The quantum-resistance of the ideal AB stack is on the order of 1 to 10

  compensation and heterochromatin formation",,,,,"q-bio.GN q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Drosophila Y chromosomes are composed entirely of silent heterochromatin,
while male X chromosomes have highly accessible chromatin and are
hypertranscribed due to dosage compensation. Here, we dissect the molecular
mechanisms and functional pressures driving heterochromatin formation and
dosage compensation of the recently formed neo-sex chromosomes of Drosophila
miranda. We show that the onset of heterochromatin formation on the neo-Y is
triggered by an accumulation of repetitive DNA. The neo-X has evolved partial
dosage compensation and we find that diverse mutational paths have been
utilized to establish several dozen novel binding consensus motifs for the
dosage compensation complex on the neo-X, including simple point mutations at
pre-binding sites, insertion and deletion mutations, microsatellite expansions,
or tandem amplification of weak binding sites. Spreading of these silencing or
activating chromatin modifications to adjacent regions results in massive
mis-expression of neo-sex linked genes, and little correspondence between
functionality of genes and their silencing on the neo-Y or dosage compensation
on the neo-X. Intriguingly, the genomic regions being targeted by the dosage
compensation complex on the neo-X and those becoming heterochromatic on the
neo-Y show little overlap, possibly reflecting different propensities along the
ancestral chromosome to adopt active or repressive chromatin configurations.
Our findings have broad implications for current models of sex chromosome
evolution, and demonstrate how mechanistic constraints can limit evolutionary
adaptations. Our study also highlights how evolution can follow predictable
genetic trajectories, by repeatedly acquiring the same 21-bp consensus motif
for recruitment of the dosage compensation complex, yet utilizing a diverse
array of random mutational changes to attain the same phenotypic outcome.

in such systems, it is important to take into account the spatial dependence of
the permittivity of the medium. However, due to the ensuing theoretical and
computational challenges, this inhomogeneous dielectric response of the medium
is often ignored or excessively simplified. We develop a variational
formulation of electrostatics to accurately investigate systems that exhibit
this inhomogeneous dielectric response. Our formulation is based on a true
energy functional of the polarization charge density. The defining
characteristic of a true energy functional is that at its minimum it evaluates
to the actual value of the energy; this is a feature not found in many commonly
used electrostatic functionals. We explore in detail the charged systems that
exhibit sharp discontinuous change in dielectric permittivity, and we show that
for this case our functional reduces to a functional of only the surface
polarization charge density. We apply this reduced functional to study model
problems for which analytical solutions are well known. We demonstrate, in
addition, that the functional has many properties that make it ideal for use in
molecular dynamics simulations.

absorbers in aqueous solution. The photoacoustic generation from solutions of
organic dye and gold nanospheres (with same optical densities), illuminated
with 532 nm nanosecond pulses, was detected using a high frequency ultrasound
transducer (center frequency 20 MHz). Photoacoustic emission was observed with
gold nanospheres at low fluence (a few mJ/cm2) for an equilibrium temperature
around 4{\deg}C, where the linear photoacoustic effect in water vanishes,
highlighting the nonlinear emission from the solution of nanospheres. Under the
same condition, no emission was observed with the absorbing organic dye. At a
fixed fluence of 5 mJ/cm2, the photoacoustic amplitude was studied as a
function of the equilibrium temperature from 2{\deg}C to 20{\deg}C. While the
photoacoustic amplitude from the organic dye followed \beta(T) in water and
vanished around 4{\deg}C, the photoacoustic amplitude from the gold nanospheres
remained significant over the whole temperature range. These experimental
results are shown to be in qualitative agreement with theoretical calculations
based on the nanoscale and nanosecond transient changes of the coefficient of
thermal expansion of water around the gold nanospheres. Our results suggest
that in the context of high frequency photoacoustic imaging, nanoparticles may

the ICM contains useless information about the formation of structures and CRs.
Such past and current information is carried intact by its non-thermal emission
caused by highly relativistic particles spiraling in large-scale magnetic
fields. The diffuse radio emission is not associated with the active galactic
nucleus phenomenon and has no optical counterpart. Instead it is associated
with the ICM and it is characterized by steep spectrum. The low surface radio
brightness features are thought to be formed via re-acceleration of a relic
population of relativistic electrons, or proton-proton collisions with the ICM.
Diffuse radio sources are classified typically as `relics', `halos',
'mini-halos' and 'radio-ghosts'. We use a sample of 67 nearby clusters of
galaxies at redshift, 0.02 < z < 0.1, to tackle the relation between the
diffuse radio emission and the large scale structure (cosmic web), dark matter

halos can substantially contribute to the counts of sources at low brightness.

starting points for the formulation of powerful computational techniques such

media and systems with magnetically active particles are important examples. In
these examples and other important cases, the variational principles describing
the system are required to obey a number of constraints. These constraints are
implemented within the variational formulation by means of Lagrange
multipliers. Such constrained variational formulations are in general not
unique. For the application of efficient simulation methods, one must find
specific formulations that satisfy a number of important conditions. An often
required condition is that the functional be positive-definite, in other words,
its extrema be actual minima. In this article, we present a general approach to
attack the problem of finding, among equivalent variational functionals, those
that generate true minima. The method is based on the modification of the
Lagrange multiplier which allows us to generate large families of effective
variational formulations associated with a single original constrained

show at least four groups of coronal loops at different heights overlying the

rate of contraction is closely associated with the intensity of the hard X-ray

the dimming associated with the formation of the Coronal Mass Ejection (CME)

radio emission at the Yakutsk array of extensive air showers at a frequency of
32 MHz. At this stage, emission registration involves two set of antennas, the
distance between them is 500m. One set involves 8 antennas, second - 4
antennas. The antennas are perpendicularly crossed dipoles with radiation
pattern North South,West East and raised 1.5 m above the ground. Each set of
antennas connected to an industrial PC. The registration requires one of two
triggers. First trigger are generated by scintillation detectors of Yakutsk
array. Scintillation detectors cover area of 12 km^2 and registers air showers
with energy more than 10^17 eV. The second trigger is generated by Small
Cherenkov Array that covers area of 1 km^2 and registers air showers with
energy 10^15 - 5*10^17 eV. Small Cherenkov Array is part of Yakutsk array and
involve Cherenkov detectors located at a distance of 50, 100, 250 m. For
further selection we are using an additional criterion the radio pulse must be
localized in the area corresponding to the delay time on first and second
triggers. In addition, descriptions of the algorithm and the flowcharts of the
program for the air shower selection and further analysis are given. This
method registers EAS radio emission with energy 10^16 - 10^19 eV. With the
absolute calibration, the amplitudes of all antennas converted to a single

First, almost half of stellar systems in the solar neighborhood are multiple
systems. Second, the comparison of the planet occurrence rate for multiple
stars to that for single stars sheds light on the influence of stellar
multiplicity on planet formation and evolution. We developed a method of
distinguishing planet occurrence rates for single and multiple stars. From a
sample of 138 bright (KP <13.5) Kepler multi-planet candidate systems, we
compared the stellar multiplicity rate of these planet host stars to that of
field stars. Using dynamical stability analyses and archival Doppler
measurements, we find that the stellar multiplicity rate of planet host stars
is significantly lower than field stars for semi-major axes less than 20 AU,
suggesting that planet formation and evolution are suppressed by the presence
of a close-in companion star at these separations. The influence of stellar
multiplicity at larger separations is uncertain because of search in-
completeness due to a limited Doppler observation time baseline and a lack of
high resolution imaging observation. We calculated the planet confidence for
the sample of mutlti-planet candidates, and find that the planet confidences
for KOI 82.01, KOI 115.01, KOI 282.01 and KOI 1781.02 are higher than 99.7% and
thus validate the planetary nature of these four planet candidates. This sample

  Road Map Distances",,,,,"stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Earth movers distance (EMD) is a measure of distance between probability
distributions which is at the heart of mass transportation theory. Recent
research has shown that the EMD plays a crucial role in studying the potential
impact of Demand-Responsive Transportation (DRT) and Mobility-on-Demand (MoD)
systems, which are growing paradigms for one-way vehicle sharing where people
drive (or are driven by) shared vehicles from a point of origin to a point of
destination. While the ubiquitous physical transportation setting is the road
network, characterized by systems of roads connected together by interchanges,
most analytical works about vehicle sharing represent distances between points
in a plane using the simple Euclidean metric. Instead, we consider the EMD when
the ground metric is taken from a class of one-dimensional, continuous metric
spaces, reminiscent of road networks. We produce an explicit formulation of the
Earth movers distance given any finite road network R. The result generalizes
the EMD with a Euclidean R1 ground metric, which had remained one of the only
known non-discrete cases with an explicit formula. Our formulation casts the
EMD as the optimal value of a finite-dimensional, real-valued optimization
problem, with a convex objective function and linear constraints. In the
special case that the input distributions have piece-wise uniform (constant)
density, the problem reduces to one whose objective function is convex
quadratic. Both forms are amenable to modern mathematical programming
techniques.

other contests to contrast the dynamics of rank-driven and score-driven tables,
and to explain why the ARWU ranking is a score-driven procedure. We show that

stability is mostly determined by strain, whereas for lattice-matched
nonisovalent superlattices the interfacial energy depend not only on the bond

Various generalisations of these fundamental results have been obtained for
other settings, in particular, for curves and more generally manifolds. In this
paper we develop the theory for planar curves by completing the theory in the
case of parabola. This represents the first comprehensive study of its kind in

in a FoV of ~34'x40'. Spitzer observations along with NIR observations are used
to identify 1162 Class II/III & 40 Class I sources in the FoV. The NN stellar
surface density analysis shows that majority of these YSOs constitute the
embedded cluster centered on the source IRS1A South. Some YSOs, predominantly
younger population, are distributed along & trace the filamentary structures at
lower stellar surface density. The cluster radius is obtained as 0.44pc -
matching well with the extent of radio emission - with a peak density of
650pc^-2. The JHK data is used to map the extinction which is subsequently used
to compute the cloud mass. It has resulted in 126 Msun & 71 Msun for the
central cluster & the northern IRS5 region, respectively. H2 narrow-band
imaging displays significant emission, which prominently resembles fluorescent
emission arising at the borders of dense regions. Radio analysis shows this
region as having blister morphology, with the radio peak coinciding with a
protostellar source. Free-free emission SED analysis is used to obtain physical
parameters of the overall region & the IRS5 sub-region. This multiwavelength
scenario is suggestive of star formation having resulted from merging of
multiple filaments to form a hub. Star formation seems to have taken place in
two successive epochs, with the first epoch traced by the central cluster & the
high-mass star(s) - followed by a second epoch which is spreading into the
filaments as uncovered by the Class I sources & even younger protostellar
sources along the filaments. The IRS5 HII region displays indications of
swept-up material which has possibly led to the formation of protostars.

on clusters of modern CPUs, many integrated core devices (MICs), and graphics
processing units (GPUs). It is shown that the total number of the
synchronization events can be significantly reduced when a deep, 2h grid
hierarchy is replaced with a two-level scheme using 16h-32h restriction,
fitting to the the width of the SIMD engine of modern CPUs and GPUs. In
addition, optimal memory transfer is also ensured, since no strided memory
access is required. We report increasing arithmetic intensity of the smoothing
steps when compared to the conventional additive correction multigrid (ACM),
however it is counterbalanced in runtime by the decreasing number of the
expensive restriction steps. A systematic construction methodology for the
coarse grid stencil is also presented that helps in moderating the excess
arithmetic intensity associated with the aggressive coarsening. Our higher
order interpolated stencil improves convergence rate via minimizing spurious
interference between the coarse and the fine scale solutions. The method is
demonstrated on solving the pressure equation for 2D incompressible fluid flow:
The benchmark setups cover shear driven laminar flow in cavity, and direct
numerical simulation (DNS) of a turbulent jet. We have compared our scheme to
the ACM in terms of the arithmetic intensity of the iterations and the number
of the synchronization calls required. Also the strong scaling is plotted for
our scheme when using a hybrid OpenCl/MPI based parallelization.

derived from VLBI observations is important for tasks such as estimating the
quality of the catalogues and their weighting during combination. One of the
widely used methods to estimate these errors is the three-cornered-hat
technique, which can be extended to the N-cornered-hat technique. A critical
point of this method is how to properly account for the correlations between
the compared catalogues. We present a new approach to solving this problem that
is suitable for simultaneous investigations of several catalogues. To compute
the correlation between two catalogues $A$ and $B$, the differences between
these catalogues and a third arbitrary catalogue $C$ are computed. Then the
correlation between these differences is considered as an estimate of the
correlation between catalogues $A$ and $B$. The average value of these
estimates over all catalogues $C$ is taken as a final estimate of the target
correlation. In this way, an exhaustive search of all possible combinations
allows one to compute the paired correlations between all catalogues. As an
additional refinement of the method, we introduce the concept of weighted
correlation coefficient. This technique was applied to nine recently published
radio source position catalogues. We found large systematic differences between
catalogues, that significantly impact determination of their stochastic errors.
Finally, we estimated the stochastic errors of the nine catalogues.

contact, $t-$channel $\bar K$ exchange, $s-$channel nucleon pole and
$N^*(2120)$ [previously called $N^*(2080)$] resonance contributions, which have
been already considered in previous works, we also study the $u-$channel
$\Lambda(1115)$ hyperon pole term. The latter mechanism has always been ignored
in all theoretical analysis, which has mostly relied on the very forward $K^+$
angular LEPS data. It is shown that when the contributions from the $N^*(2120)$
resonance and the $\Lambda(1115)$ hyperon are taken into account, both the new
CLAS and the previous LEPS data can be simultaneously described. We also show
that the contribution from the $u-$channel $\Lambda(1115)$ pole term produces
an enhancement for large $K^+$ angles, and it becomes more and more relevant as
the photon energy increases, being essential to describe the CLAS differential
cross sections at backward angles. Furthermore, we find that the new CLAS data
also favor the existence of the $N^*(2120)$ resonance, and that these
measurements can be used to further constrain its properties.

electron spectrum in a spherically expanding pulsar wind nebula (PWN) is
presented, allowing one to make broadband predictions for the PWN's non-thermal

of the PWN is chosen to be a broken power law. In contrast to previous PWN
models of a similar nature, the source spectrum has a discontinuity in
intensity at the transition between the low and high-energy components. To test
the model, it is applied to the young PWN G21.5--0.9, where it is found that a
discontinuous source spectrum can model the emission at all wavelengths better
than a continuous one. The model is also applied to the unidentified sources
HESS J1427--608 and HESS J1507--622. Parameters are derived for these two
candidate nebulae that are consistent with the values predicted for other PWNe.
For HESS J1427--608 a present-day magnetic field of $B\s{age}=0.4\,\mu\text{G}$
is derived. As a result of the small present-day magnetic field, this source
has a low synchrotron luminosity, while remaining bright at GeV/TeV energies.
It is therefore possible to interpret HESS J1427--608 within the ancient PWN
scenario. For the second candidate PWN HESS J1507--622, a present-day magnetic
field of $B\s{age}=1.7\,\mu\text{G}$ is derived. Furthermore, for this
candidate PWN a scenario is favoured in the present paper in which HESS

investigated using two-dimensional simulations with a realistic cooling rate,
thermal conduction, and physical viscosity. The calculations are performed
using periodic boundary conditions without any external dynamical forcing. As
the initial condition, a spatially uniform unstable gas under thermal
equilibrium is considered. At the initial stage, the unstable gas quickly
segregates into two phases, or cold neutral medium (CNM) and warm neutral
medium (WNM). Then, self-sustained turbulence with velocity dispersion of
$0.1-0.2\;\mathrm{km\;s^{-1}}$ is observed in which the CNM moves around in the
WNM. We find that the interfacial medium (IFM) between the CNM and WNM plays an
important role in sustaining the turbulence. The self-sustaining mechanism can
be divided into two steps. First, thermal conduction drives fast flows
streaming into concave CNM surfaces towards the WNM. The kinetic energy of the
fast flows in the IFM is incorporated into that of the CNM through the phase
transition. Second, turbulence inside the CNM deforms interfaces and forms
other concave CNM surfaces, leading to fast flows in the IFM. This drives the
first step again and a cycle is established by which turbulent motions are
self-sustained.

is bi-modal with a peak at short (< 10 days) and long (> 250 days) periods.
Observationally, many short-period sdB systems are known, but the predicted
long period peak is missing as orbits have only been determined for a few
long-period systems. As these predictions are based on poorly understood
binary-interaction processes, it is of prime importance to confront the
predictions with reliable observational data. We therefore initiated a
monitoring program to find and characterize long-period sdB stars. In this
paper we aim to determine the orbital parameters of the three long-period
sdB+MS binaries BD+29 3070, BD+34 1543 and Feige 87, to constrain their
absolute dimensions and the physical parameters of the components.
High-resolution spectroscopic time series were obtained with HERMES at the
Mercator telescope on La Palma, and analyzed to determine the radial velocities
of both the sdB and MS components. Photometry from the literature was used to
construct the spectral-energy distribution (SED) of the binaries. Atmosphere
models were used to fit these SEDs and to determine the surface gravities and
temperatures of both components of all systems. Spectral analysis was used to
check the results of the SEDs. An orbital period of 1283 +- 63 d, a mass ratio
of q = 0.39 +- 0.04 and a significant non-zero eccentricity of e = 0.15 +- 0.01
were found for BD+29 3070. For BD+34 1543 we determined P = 972 +- 2 d, q =
0.57 +- 0.01 and again a clear non-zero eccentricity of e = 0.16 +- 0.01. Last,
for Feige 87 we found P = 936 +- 2 d, q = 0.55 +- 0.01 and e = 0.11 +- 0.01.
BD+29 3070, BD+34 1543 and Feige 87 are long period sdB + MS binaries on
clearly eccentric orbits. These results are in conflict with the predictions of

For all the massive virtual galaxies we carry out a careful study of their one
dimensional density, luminosity, velocity dispersion, and stellar population
profiles. In order to best compare with observational data, the method to
estimate the velocity dispersion is calibrated by using an approach similar to
that performed in the observations, based on the stellar populations of the
simulated galaxies. With these ingredients, we discuss the different properties
of massive galaxies in our sample according to their morphological types,
accretion histories and dynamical properties. We find that the galaxy merging
history is the leading actor in shaping the massive galaxies that we see
nowadays. Indeed, galaxies having experienced a turbulent life are the most
massive in the sample and show the steepest metallicity gradients. Beside the
importance of merging, only a small fraction of the final stellar mass has been
formed ex-situ (10-50%), while the majority of the stars formed within the
galaxy. These accreted stars are significantly older and less metallic than the
stars formed in-situ and tend to occupy the most external regions of the
galaxies.

unjam. The slow unjamming process is understood as a result of gradual changes

particles only contributes to relaxation of frictional forces, and hence, does
not significantly cause structural changes. For the shear-jammed states, the
global building up and relaxation of stress, which occurs in the form of stress
avalanches, is qualitatively different for disks and ellipses, and is
manifested by different forms of rate-dependence for ellipses vs. disks. Unlike

potentially large Higgs-mediated flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC)
problem, unless additional symmetries are imposed on the Higgs fields thereby
respecting the Natural Flavor Conservation Criterion (NFC) by Glashow and
Weinberg. A common way to respect the NFC is to impose Z_2 symmetry which is
softly broken by a dim-2 operator. Another new way is to introduce local U(1)_H
Higgs flavor symmetry that distinguishes one Higgs doublet from the other. In
this paper, we consider the Higgs phenomenology in Type-I 2HDMs with the U(1)_H
symmetry with the simplest U(1)_H assignments that the SM fermions are all
neutral under U(1)_H, and we make detailed comparison with the ordinary Type-I
2HDM. After imposing various constraints such as vacuum stability and
perturbativity as well as the electroweak precision observables and collider
search bounds on charged Higgs boson, we find that the allowed Higgs signal
strengths in our model are much broader than those in the ordinary Type-I 2HDM,
because of newly introduced U(1)_H-charged singlet scalar and U(1)_H gauge
boson. Still the ATLAS data on gg to h to gamma gamma cannot be accommodated.
Our model could be distinguished from the ordinary 2HDM with the Z_2 symmetry
in a certain parameter region and some channels. If the couplings of the new
boson turn out to be close to those in the SM, it would be essential to search
for extra U(1)_H gauge boson and/or one more neutral scalar boson to
distinguish two models.

DNA and associated proteins. The main organizational unit is the nucleosome,
which consists of a histone octamer with DNA wrapped around it. Histone
proteins are implicated in the regulation of eukaryote genes and they carry
numerous reversible post-translational modifications that control DNA-protein
interactions and the recruitment of chromatin binding proteins.
Heterochromatin, the transcriptionally inactive part of the genome, is densely
packed and contains histone H3 that is methylated at Lys 9 (H3K9me). The
propagation of H3K9me in nucleosomes along the DNA in chromatin is antagonizing
by methylation of H3 Lysine 4 (H3K4me) and acetylations of several lysines,
which is related to euchromatin and active genes. We show that the related
histone modifications form antagonized domains on a coarse scale. These histone
marks are assumed to be initiated within distinct nucleation sites in the DNA
and to propagate bi-directionally. We propose a simple computer model that
simulates the distribution of heterochromatin in human chromosomes. The
simulations are in agreement with previously reported experimental observations
from two different human cell lines. We reproduced different types of barriers
between heterochromatin and euchromatin providing a unified model for their
function. The effect of changes in the nucleation site distribution and of
propagation rates were studied. The former occurs mainly with the aim of
(de-)activation of single genes or gene groups and the latter has the power of
controlling the transcriptional programs of entire chromosomes. Generally, the
regulatory program of gene transcription is controlled by the distribution of
nucleation sites along the DNA string.

the scaling function. We show that the states in our formalism form a module
over the ring of functions that are made up of sums of exponentials times
polynomials and delta functions. We analyze properties of this formalism and
show how it works for selected systems. Finally, we discuss how our formalism

These capabilities cover most application needs: nuclear fission and fusion,
accelerator physics, isotope production, waste management and many more. In

encompassing thousands of target nuclides, the evolution of the ENDF format and
the capabilities of the latest generation of processing codes PREPRO-2012,

incident particles are placed in evaluated data files up to an incident energy

It is shown that for the case of the radial, two dimensional NLS equation, such

equations for a spatially flat and isotropic universe sourced by a
self-interacting scalar field and a barotropic perfect fluid. Consequently,
analytical techniques that have been developed to study the dynamics of such

quantum mechanics. In this paper, the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism of the
Friedmann equations, where the scalar field is viewed as the dynamical

of the wavefunction evolution equations is identified. The analysis has direct

that, for practical purposes, the expected radiation levels prohibit the use of
complex remote handling operations to replace the first wall. In 2012/13, these
remote maintenance activities were further extended, providing an insight into
the requirements, constraints and challenges. In particular, the assessment of
blanket and divertor maintenance, in light of the expected radiation conditions
and availability, has elaborated the need for a very different approach from
that of ITER. This activity has produced some very informative virtual reality
simulations of the blanket segments and pipe removal that are exceptionally
valuable in communicating the complexity and scale of the required operations.

been possible demonstrating that a full replacement of the blankets within 6

the algorithm is optimally efficient when the variance of the noise is

collision, especially in the final state pion gas. The jet has a large energy,
and acquires momentum transverse to its axis more effectively by multiple soft
collisions than by few hard scatterings (as known from analogous systems such
as J/\psi production at Hera). Such regime of large E and small momentum
transfer corresponds to Regge kinematics and is characteristically dominated by
the pomeron. From this insight we estimate the jet quenching parameter in the
hadron medium (largely a pion gas) at the end of the collision, which is
naturally small and increases with temperature in line with the gas density.
The physics in the quark-gluon plasma/liquid phase is less obvious, and here we
revisit a couple of simple estimates that suggest indeed that the
pomeron-mediated interactions are very relevant and should be included in
analysis of the jet quenching parameter. Finally, the ocasional hard collisions
produce features characteristic of a L\`evy flight in the q_perp^2 plane
perpendicular to the jet axis. We suggest one- and two-particle q_perp

a sudden decline in the 2.0-60.0 keV X-ray intensity by a factor of 4-12
simultaneous with the increase in hardness ratio by a factor of 2-4. Using 31
observations of GRS 1915+105 with RXTE/PCA, we show that different behavior are
observed in different types of variability classes, and we find that a
dichotomy is observed between classes with abrupt transitions vs those with
smoother evolution. For example, both energy-lag spectra and frequency-lag
spectra of hard X-ray dips in classes with abrupt transitions and shorter dip
intervals show hard-lag (hard photons lag soft photons), while both lag spectra
during hard dips in classes with smoother evolution and longer dip intervals
show soft-lag. Both lag time-scales are of the order of 100-600 msec. We also
show that timing and spectral properties of hard X-ray dips observed in light

properties of the abrupt transitions in GRS 1915+105 rather than smooth

dip time is observed for both abrupt and smooth transition which may be due to
two distinct physical processes whose time-scales are eventually correlated. We

Second, we prove that any transient solution that emerges from the NDA of some

in the attractive Hubbard model within the framework of dynamical mean field
theory. For a fixed interaction strength ($U$), the SC order parameter (OP)
decreases monotonically with increasing disorder ($x$), while the
single-particle spectral gap (SG) decreases for small $x$, reaches a minimum
and keeps increasing for larger $x$. Thus, the system remains gapped beyond the
destruction of the superconducting state, indicating a disorder-driven
superconductor-insulator transition. We investigate this transition in depth
considering the effects of weak and strong disorder for a range of interaction
strengths. In the clean case, the order-parameter is known to increase
monotonically with increasing interaction, saturating at a finite value
asymptotically for $U\rightarrow \infty$. The presence of disorder results in
destruction of superconductivity at large $U$, thus drastically modifying the
clean case behaviour. A physical understanding of our findings is obtained by
invoking particle-hole asymmetry and the probability distributions of the order
parameter and spectral gap.

assuming the torus exists, the initial estimate is suitably close, and the map
satisfies certain nondegeneracy conditions. We demonstrate that the growth of
the largest singular value of the derivative of the conjugacy predicts the

examine the mechanics of the breakup of the tori, making comparisons to

nonlinear boundary layer equations are solved. The result is compared to the
linear boundary layer solution in Liu et al. (2007) reveal- ing that both
profiles are disagreeing more than has been found before. A change of frame of
reference has been used to allow for a classical linear stability analysis
without the need to redefine the notion of stability for this otherwise
unsteady flow. For the linear stability the Orr-Sommerfeld equation and the
parabolic stability equation were used. The results are compared to key results
of inviscid stability theory and validated by means of a direct numerical
simulation using a Legendre-Galerkin spectral ele- ment Navier-Stokes solver.
Special care has been taken to ensure that the numerical results are valid.
Linear stability predicts that the boundary layer flow is unstable for the
entire parameter range considered, confirm- ing qualitatively the results by
Blondeaux et al. (2012). As a result of this analysis the stability of this
flow cannot be described by a critical Reynolds number unlike what is atempted
in previous publications. This apparent contradiction can be resolved by
looking at the amplification factor responsible for the amplification of the
perturbation. For lower Reynolds numbers, the boundary layer flow becomes
unstable in the de- celeration region of the flow. For higher Reynolds numbers,
instability arises also in the acceleration region of the flow, confirming,
albeit only qualitatively, an observation in the experiments by Sumer et al.
(2010).

quadratic algebra with involution encoding this bispectrality is obtained. The
orthogonality measure is derived in two different ways: by using Chihara's
method for kernel polynomials and, by obtaining the symmetry factor for the

that they can be obtained from the big $q$-Jacobi by a $q\rightarrow -1$ limit.

of induction from a Borel part) behaves well, when $p>2h-2$, with respect to
certain weight poset ""truncations"", making use of van der Kallen's 1989

produced across wide range in rapidity, probe the early stages of the reaction.
The analyses of forward-backward multiplicity correlations in these collisions
are complicated by several effects, which are absent or minimized in
hadron-hadron collisions. This includes effects, such as the centrality
selection in the {\it A-A} collisions, which interfere with the measurement of
the dynamical correlations. A method, which takes into account the fluctuations
in centrality selection, has been utilized to determine the forward-backward
correlation strength {$b_{\rm corr}$} in {\itA-A} collisions. This method has
been validated by using the HIJING event generator in case of Au-Au collisions
at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 200 GeV and Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 2.76 TeV.
It is shown that the effect of impact parameter fluctuations is to be

Carlo simulations, we study the probability that a given edge is not a bridge

the two-arm exponent. We then classify bridges into two types: branches and
junctions. A bridge is a {\em branch} iff at least one of the two clusters
produced by its deletion is a tree. Starting from a percolation configuration
and deleting the branches results in a {\em leaf-free} configuration, while
deleting all bridges produces a bridge-free configuration. Although branches
account for $\approx 43%$ of all occupied bonds, we find that the fractal
dimensions of the cluster size and hull length of leaf-free configurations are
consistent with those for standard percolation configurations. By contrast, we
find that the fractal dimensions of the cluster size and hull length of

the growth conditions, we show that the main reason for the n-doping in these

defects acting like acceptors such as Mg vacancies or multivacancies are more
stable in Mg2Ge than in Mg2Si, this explains why Mg2Ge can be of n or p type,

anomalous characteristic temperature (T* ~60K), above which magnetization tends
to saturate. Magnetization isotherm recorded below TN at 125K shows clear loop
opening without magnetization saturation up to 20kOe, indicating the
coexistence of antiferromagnetic (AFM) interaction with weak ferromagnetic

complex magnetic phase below TN. Temperature evolution of lineshape parameters

agreement with the magnetization results and reflects the change in spin

positive and negative shift in Raman frequency below TN revel the existence of
competing WFM and AFM exchanges. The phonon shift of B3g (3)-octahedral
rotation mode fairly scaled with the square of sublattice magnetization from TN

  Proceedings of the PPEPPD Conference 2013",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hydrotropes are amphiphilic molecules that are too small to spontaneously
form equilibrium structures in aqueous solutions, but form dynamic, noncovalent
assemblies, referred to as clusters. In the presence of a hydrophobic compound,
these clusters seem to get stabilized leading to the formation of long-lived,
highly stable mesoscopic droplets, a phenomenon that we call mesoscale
solubilization. In this work, we focus on the unusual mesoscopic properties of
aqueous solutions of a nonionic hydrotrope, namely tertiary butyl alcohol
(TBA), on addition of various hydrophobic compounds. Aqueous TBA solutions, in
about 3 to 8 mol percent TBA concentration range and about 0 to 25 deg. C
temperature range, show the presence of short-ranged (0.5 nm), short-lived
(tens of picoseconds) molecular clusters which result in anomalies of the
thermodynamic properties. These clusters are transient but do not relax by
diffusion, thus distinctly different from conventional concentration
fluctuations. In this concentration and temperature range, upon the addition of
a third (more hydrophobic) component to TBA-water solutions, long-lived
mesoscopic droplets of about 100 nm size are observed. In this work, we clarify
the ambiguity behind the definition of solubility and elucidate the phenomenon
of mesoscale solubilization. A systematic study of the macro and meso phase
behavior of three ternary systems TBA-water-propylene oxide, TBA-water-isobutyl
alcohol, and TBA-water-cyclohexane has been carried out. We differentiate
between molecular solubility, mesoscale solubilization, and macroscopic phase
separation. We have confirmed that practically stable aqueous colloids can be
created from small molecules, without addition of surfactants or polymers. Such
kind of novel materials may find applications in the design of various
processes and products, ranging from pharmaceuticals to cosmetics and

in expectation by unilateral deviation. An epsilon well-supported approximate
Nash equilibrium has the stronger requirement that every pure strategy used
with positive probability must have payoff within epsilon of the best response
payoff. Daskalakis, Mehta and Papadimitriou conjectured that every win-lose
bimatrix game has a 2/3-well-supported Nash equilibrium that uses supports of
cardinality at most three. Indeed, they showed that such an equilibrium will
exist subject to the correctness of a graph-theoretic conjecture. Regardless of
the correctness of this conjecture, we show that the barrier of a 2/3 payoff
guarantee cannot be broken with constant size supports; we construct win-lose
games that require supports of cardinality at least Omega((log n)^(1/3)) in any
epsilon-well supported equilibrium with epsilon < 2/3. The key tool in showing
the validity of the construction is a proof of a bipartite digraph variant of
the well-known Caccetta-Haggkvist conjecture. A probabilistic argument shows
that there exist epsilon-well-supported equilibria with supports of cardinality
O(log n/(epsilon^2)), for any epsilon> 0; thus, the polylogarithmic cardinality
bound presented cannot be greatly improved. We also show that for any delta >

incomplete data in some regions of the world. Here we explore the opportunity
of using proxy data or models for individual mobility to describe commuting
movements and predict the diffusion of infectious disease. We consider three
European countries and the corresponding commuting networks at different
resolution scales obtained from official census surveys, from proxy data for
human mobility extracted from mobile phone call records, and from the radiation
model calibrated with census data. Metapopulation models defined on the three
countries and integrating the different mobility layers are compared in terms
of epidemic observables. We show that commuting networks from mobile phone data
well capture the empirical commuting patterns, accounting for more than 87% of
the total fluxes. The distributions of commuting fluxes per link from both
sources of data - mobile phones and census - are similar and highly correlated,
however a systematic overestimation of commuting traffic in the mobile phone
data is observed. This leads to epidemics that spread faster than on census
commuting networks, however preserving the order of infection of newly infected
locations. Match in the epidemic invasion pattern is sensitive to initial
conditions: the radiation model shows higher accuracy with respect to mobile
phone data when the seed is central in the network, while the mobile phone
proxy performs better for epidemics seeded in peripheral locations. Results
suggest that different proxies can be used to approximate commuting patterns
across different resolution scales in spatial epidemic simulations, in light of
the desired accuracy in the epidemic outcome under study.

possess a non-Gaussian fixed point and a one-parameter family of Gaussian fixed
points. One of the Gaussian fixed points corresponds to the Einstein-Hilbert
action with vanishing cosmological constant and constitutes a saddle point with
one IR-attractive direction. For RG trajectories dragged into this fixed point
at low energies diffeomorphism invariance is restored. The emergence of general
relativity from Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity can thus be understood as a
crossover-phenomenon where the IR behavior of the theory is controlled by this

cosmological constant also come with an anisotropy parameter which is
compatible with experimental constraints, providing a mechanism for the

throughout, and the transition rate is found by taking the sharp-switching
limit of the regulator-free and finite response function. The detector is
analysed on a variety of spacetimes: $d$-dimensional Minkowski, the
Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole, the two-dimensional Minkowski
half-plane, two-dimensional Minkowski with a receding mirror, and the two- and
four-dimensional Schwarzschild black holes. In $d$-dimensional Minkowski
spacetime, the transition rate is found to be finite up to dimension five. In
dimension six, the transition rate diverges unless the detector is on a
trajectory of constant proper acceleration, and the implications of this
divergence to the global embedding spacetime (GEMS) methods are studied. In
three-dimensional curved spacetime, the transition rate for the scalar field in
an arbitrary Hadamard state is found to be finite and regulator-free. Then on
the Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole spacetime, we analyse the
detector coupled to the field in the Hartle-Hawking vacua, under both
transparent and reflective boundary conditions at infinity. Results are
presented for the co-rotating detector, which responds thermally, and for the
radially-infalling detector. In four-dimensional Schwarzschild spacetime, we
proceed numerically, and the Hartle-Hawking, Boulware and Unruh vacua rates are
compared. Results are presented for the case of the static detectors, which
respond thermally, and also for the case of co-rotating detectors.

two possible causes related with the presence of a second layer that could

catalytic effect during its creation. For the former, the obtained formation
energies of the defect in monolayer and bilayer systems show that the change in

simulations indicate that the threshold energy for direct expulsion does not
decrease in bilayer graphene as compared with monolayer graphene, and we
demonstrate the possibility of creating divacancies through catalyzed
intermediate states below this threshold energy. The estimated cross section
agrees with what is observed experimentally. Therefore, we show the possibility

attention concentrated to the axisymmetric motion of string loops around
symmetry axis of both black-hole (BH) and naked singularity (NS) spacetimes, it
is shown that the resulting motion is governed by the presence of an outer
tension barrier and an inner angular momentum barrier that are influenced by
the BH or NS spin. We classify the string dynamics according to properties of
the energy boundary function (effective potential) for the string loop motion.
We have found that for NS there exist new types of energy boundary function,
namely those with off-equatorial minima. Conversion of the energy of the string
oscillations to the energy of the linear translational motion has been studied.
Such a transmutation effect is much more efficient in the NS spacetimes because
lack of the event horizon. For BH spacetimes efficiency of the transmutation
effect is only weakly spin dependent. Transition from regular to chaotic regime
of the string-loop dynamics is examined and used for explanation of the
string-loop motion focusing problem. Radial and vertical frequencies of small
oscillations of string loops near minima of the effective potential in the
equatorial plane are given. These can be related to high-frequency
quasi-periodic oscillations observed near black holes.

evidence of modular and hierarchical modular product architectures and known

architectures are then subject to various forms of attack. The attacks simulate
failure of critical hardware or software. Four types of attack are
investigated: degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality
and random attack. Failure tolerance of the system is measured by a 'robustness
coefficient', a topological 'size' metric of the connectedness of the attacked
network. We find that the betweenness centrality attack results in the most
significant reduction in the robustness coefficient, confirming betweenness
centrality, rather than the number of connections (i.e. degree), as the most
conservative metric of component importance. A counter-intuitive finding is
that ""designed"" system architectures, including a bus, ring, and star
architecture, are not significantly more failure-tolerant than interconnections
with no prescribed architecture, that is, a random architecture. Our research
provides a data-driven approach to engineer the architecture of mechatronic

experimental analyses on two benchmark data sets demonstrate that both
recommendation and accuracy and diversity are improved duet to the similarity
preference in the diffusion. The hybridization of the similarity preferential

approximation, which allows exact calculations so that comparison with the
universally applicable, but generally uncontrolled, proximity force
approximation may be made. In particular, we examine Casimir energies between
planar objects characterized by $\delta$-function potentials, and consider the
torque that arises when angles between the objects are changed. The results
agree very well with the proximity force approximation when the separation
distance between the objects is small compared with their sizes. In the
opposite limit, where the size of one object is comparable to the separation
distance, the shape dependence starts becoming irrelevant. These calculations
are illustrative of what to expect for the torques between, for example,
conducting planar objects, which eventually should be amenable to both improved
theoretical calculation and experimental verification.

the pluralistic, antimonistic metaphysical consequences of the theory, due to
the impossibility of assigning a state to the quantum universe. Finally, in the
last section I note interesting consequences of RQM with respect to the
possibility of defining a local, quantum relativistic becoming (in flat

would be appropriate for priority monism, RQM seems to present an important

coherent states, in which the uncertainty in the position and the momentum are
the same, these allow to reduce the uncertainty, either in the position or in
the momentum, while maintaining the principle of uncertainty in its minimum. It
seems that this property of the squeezed states would allow you to get the
position eigenstates as a limit case of them, doing null the uncertainty in the
position and infinite at the momentum. However, there are two equivalent ways
to define the squeezed states, which lead to different expressions for the
limit states. In this work, we analyze these two definitions of the squeezed
states and show the advantages and disadvantages of using such definition to
find the position eigenstates. With this idea in mind, but leaving aside the
definitions of the squeezed states, we find an operator applied to the vacuum
that gives us the position eigenstates. We also analyze some properties of the
squeezed states, based on the new expressions obtained for the eigenstates of
the position.

the capacity achieving output distribution. Relying on the concentration of

(Lipschitz) functions of channel outputs can be precisely estimated and turn
out to be essentially non-random and independent of the actual code. It is also
shown that the output distribution of a good code and the capacity achieving
one cannot be distinguished with exponential reliability. The random process
produced at the output of the channel is shown to satisfy the asymptotic
equipartition property. Using related methods it is shown that quadratic forms
and sums of $q$-th powers when evaluated at codewords of good AWGN codes
approach the values obtained from a randomly generated Gaussian codeword.

delay of generalized instantly decodable network coding (G-IDNC) over
persistent forward and feedback erasure channels with feedback intermittence.
In such an environment, the sender does not always receive acknowledgement from
the receivers after each transmission. Moreover, both the forward and feedback
channels are subject to persistent erasures, which can be modelled by a two
state (good and bad states) Markov chain known as Gilbert-Elliott channel
(GEC). Due to such feedback imperfections, the sender is unable to determine
subsequent instantly decodable packets combination for all receivers. Given
this harsh channel and feedback model, we first derive expressions for the
probability distributions of decoding delay increments and then employ these
expressions in formulating the minimum decoding problem in such environment as
a maximum weight clique problem in the G-IDNC graph. We also show that the
problem formulations in simpler channel and feedback models are special cases
of our generalized formulation. Since this problem is NP-hard, we design a
greedy algorithm to solve it and compare it to blind approaches proposed in
literature. Through extensive simulations, our adaptive algorithm is shown to
outperform the blind approaches in all situations and to achieve significant
improvement in the decoding delay, especially when the channel is highly
persistent

two-dimentional Kondo-Lattice model (KLM) with anti-ferromagnetic couplings. To
accomplish this, we first present an implementation of the dual-fermion (DF)
approach based on the hybridization expansion continuous-time quantum Monte
Carlo impurity solver (CT-HYB), which allows us to consistently compare the
local and non-local descriptions of this model. We find that, the inclusion of
non-locality restores the self-energy dispersion of the conduction electrons,
{\it i.e.} the $\vec{k}$ dependence of $\Sigma(\vec{k}, i\omega_{n})$. The
anti-ferromagnetic correlations result in an additional symmetry in
$\Sigma(\vec{k}, i\omega_{n})$, which is well described by the N\'eel
antiferromagnetic wave-vector. A ""metal""-""anti-ferromagnetic insulator""-""Kondo
insulator"" transition is observed at finite temperatures, which is driven by
the competition of the effective RKKY interaction (at the weak coupling regime)
and the Kondo singlet formation mechanism (at the strong coupling regime). Away
from half-filling, the anti-ferromagnetic phase becomes unstable against hole
doping. The system tends to develop a ferromagnetic phase with the spin
susceptibility $\chi_{s}(Q)$ peaking at $Q=\Gamma$. However, for small $J/t$,
no divergence of $\chi_{s}(\Gamma)$ is really observed, thus, we find no sign
of long-range ferromagnetism in the hole-doped two-dimension KLM. The
ferromagnetism is found to be stable at larger $J/t$ regime. Interestingly, we
find the local approximation employed in this work, {\it i.e.} the dynamical
mean-field theory (DMFT), is still a very good description of the KLM,
especially in the hole-doped case. However, at half-filling, the non-local
fluctuation effect is indeed pronounced. We observe a strong reduction of the
critical coupling strength for the onset of the Kondo insulating phase.

Majorana states in solid-state systems. Recently, several groups reported
experimental data suggesting that signatures of Majorana modes in topological
insulator Josephson junctions (TIJJs) have -- indeed -- been observed. To
verify this claim, one needs to study the topological properties of low-energy
Andreev-bound states (ABS) in TIs of which the Majorana modes are a special
case. It has been shown theoretically that topologically non-trivial low-energy
ABS are also present in TIJJs with doped topological insulators up to some
critical level of doping at which the system undergoes a topological phase
transition. Here, we present first experimental evidence for this topological
transition in the bulk band of a doped TI. Our theoretical calculations, and
numerical modeling link abrupt changes in the critical current of top-gated
TIJJs to moving the chemical potential in the charge-accumulation region on the
surface of the doped TI across a band-inversion point. We demonstrate that the
critical-current changes originate from a shift of the spatial location of
low-energy ABS from the surface to the boundary between topologically-trivial
and band-inverted regions after the transition. The appearance of a decay
channel for surface ABS is related to the vanishing of the band effective mass
in the bulk and thus exemplifies the topological character of surface ABS as
boundary modes. Importantly, the mechanism suggest a means of manipulating
Majorana modes in future experiments.

manipulating the four qubits in the two DOFs of a two-photon system without

robust against the photonic dissipation noise, compared with the integration of
several cascaded CNOT gates in one DOF.

weighted Sobolev spaces, Hilbert spaces of holomorphic functions, and weighted
$L^2$ spaces. An application to weak solutions for a Dirichlet problem

by particle number density and entropy per particle. A star is said to be in
dynamic equilibrium if it is a stationary, axisymmetric solution to the
Einstein-fluid equations with circular flow. We prove that for a star in
dynamic equilibrium, the necessary and sufficient condition for thermodynamic
equilibrium (extremum of total entropy S) is constancy of angular velocity
(\Omega), redshifted temperature, and redshifted chemical potential. Friedman
previously identified positivity of canonical energy, E, as a criterion for
dynamic stability and argued that all rotating stars are dynamically unstable
to sufficiently nonaxisymmetric perturbations (the CFS instability), so our
main focus is on axisymmetric stability. We show that for a star in dynamic
equilibrium, mode stability holds with respect to all axisymmetric
perturbations if E is positive on a certain subspace, V, of axisymmetric
Lagrangian perturbations that, in particular, have no Lagrangian change in
angular momentum density. Conversely, if E fails to be positive on V, then
there exist perturbations that can't become asymptotically stationary at late
times. We further show that for a star in thermodynamic equilibrium, the
canonical energy in the rotating frame, E_r, is related to second order changes
in ADM mass, M, and angular momentum, J, by E_r = \delta^2 M - \Omega \delta^2
J. Thus, positivity of E_r for perturbations with \delta J = 0 is a necessary
condition for thermodynamic stability (local maximum of S). For axisymmetric
perturbations we have E = E_r, so a necessary condition for thermodynamic
stability with respect to axisymmetric perturbations is positivity of E on all
perturbations with \delta J = 0, not merely on the perturbations in V. Many of
our results are in close parallel to results of Hollands and Wald for the
theory of black holes.

wavelengths between the infrared and X-rays, integrated infrared luminosity,
spectral slopes, and the covering fraction of the obscuring circumnuclear dust.
We estimate dust covering fraction assuming that the accretion disk emits
anisotropically and discuss the shortcomings and technical difficulties of this

sources factors of a 2-3 brighter than more edge-on sources, depending on
wavelength. The degree of anisotropy varies very little with wavelength such
that the overall shape of the spectral energy distribution does not vary
significantly with orientation. In the infrared, we do not observe a decrease

10 GeV and stacking 55 clusters from the HIFLUGS sample of the X-ray brightest
clusters. The choice of >10 GeV photons is optimal from the point of view of
angular resolution, while the sample selection optimizes the chances of
detecting signatures of the neutral pion decay, arising from hadronic
interactions of relativistic protons with an intra-cluster medium, which scale
with the X-ray flux. In the stacked data we detected a signal for the central
0.25 deg circle at the level of 4.3 sigma. An evidence for a spatial extent of
the signal is marginal. A subsample of cool-core clusters has higher count rate
1.9+/-0.3 per cluster compared to the subsample of non-cool core clusters

the large contribution of pion decay was found. In terms of a limit on the

decade, primarily due to scaling techniques and the short-channel effect.
Conversely, graphene (a revolutionary new material possessing an atomic
thickness) has been shown to exhibit a promising value for electrical
conductivity. Graphene would thus appear to alleviate some of the drawbacks
associated with silicon-based transistors. It is for this reason why such a
material is considered one of the most prominent candidates to replace silicon
within nano-scale transistors. The major crux here, is that graphene is
intrinsically gapless, and yet, transistors require a band-gap pertaining to a
well-defined ON/OFF logical state. Therefore, exactly as to how one would
create this band-gap in graphene allotropes is an intensive area of growing
research. Existing methods include nano-ribbons, bilayer and multi-layer
structures, carbon nanotubes, as well as the usage of the graphene substrates.
Graphene transistors can generally be classified according to two working
principles. The first is that a single graphene layer, nanoribbon or carbon
nanotube can act as a transistor channel, with current being transported along
the horizontal axis. The second mechanism is regarded as tunneling, whether
this be band-to-band on a single graphene layer, or vertically between adjacent
graphene layers. The high-frequency graphene amplifier is another talking point
in recent research, since it does not require a clear ON/OFF state, as with
logical electronics. This paper reviews both the physical properties and
manufacturing methodologies of graphene, as well as graphene-based electronic
devices, transistors, and high-frequency amplifiers from past to present
studies. Finally, we provide possible perspectives with regards to future
developments.

redshift galaxies from the literature, using an ionization-parameter sensitive
line ratio of [OIII]5007/[OII]3727 and photoionization models. We confirm that
z=2-3 galaxies show an [OIII]/[OII] ratio significantly higher than a typical
star-forming galaxy of SDSS by a factor of >~10, and the photoionization models
reveal that these high-z galaxies have an ionization parameter of log(qion/cm
s^{-1})~7.6-9.0, a factor of ~4-10 higher than local galaxies. For galaxies at
any redshift, we identify a correlation between the [OIII]/[OII] ratio and
galaxy global properties of star-formation rate (SFR), stellar mass (M_star),
and metallicity (Z). We extend the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) and
develop the fundamental ionization relation (FIR), a four-dimensional relation
of ionization parameter, SFR, M_star, and Z. The intermediate and high-z
galaxies up to z~3 follow the FIR defined with the local galaxies, in contrast
with the FMR whose possible evolution from z~2 to 3 is reported. We find that
the FMR evolution of z~2-3 appears, if one omits ionization parameter
differences, and that the FMR evolution does not exist for an average
metallicity solution of z~3 galaxies with a high-ionization parameter.
Interestingly, all of two local Lyman-continuum emitting galaxies (LyC leakers)
have a high [OIII]/[OII] ratio, indicating a positive correlation between
[OIII]/[OII] and ionizing photon escape fraction (fesc), which is successfully
explained by our photoionization models. Because [OIII]/[OII] ratios of z~2-3
galaxies, especially Ly-alpha emitters (LAEs), are comparable to, or higher
than, those of the local LyC leakers, these high-z galaxies are candidates of
Lyman-continuum emitting objects. (abridged)

quality scores without access to reference images. State-of-the-art BIQA
methods typically require subjects to score a large number of images to train a
robust model. However, subjective quality scores are imprecise, biased, and
inconsistent, and it is challenging to obtain a large scale database, or to
extend existing databases, because of the inconvenience of collecting images,
training the subjects, conducting subjective experiments, and realigning human
quality evaluations. To combat these limitations, this paper explores and
exploits preference image pairs (PIPs) such as ""the quality of image $I_a$ is
better than that of image $I_b$"" for training a robust BIQA model. The
preference label, representing the relative quality of two images, is generally
precise and consistent, and is not sensitive to image content, distortion type,
or subject identity; such PIPs can be generated at very low cost. The proposed
BIQA method is one of learning to rank. We first formulate the problem of
learning the mapping from the image features to the preference label as one of
classification. In particular, we investigate the utilization of a multiple
kernel learning algorithm based on group lasso (MKLGL) to provide a solution. A
simple but effective strategy to estimate perceptual image quality scores is
then presented. Experiments show that the proposed BIQA method is highly
effective and achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art BIQA
algorithms. Moreover, the proposed method can be easily extended to new
distortion categories.

noncommutative spacetime, the Groenewold-Moyal (GM) plane. We start with
briefly reviewing the novel features of field theories on GM plane e.g. the
$\ast$-product, restoration of Poincar\'e-Hopf symmetry and twisted commutation
relations. We then discuss our work on renormalization of field theories on GM
plane. We show that any generic noncommutative theory involving pure matter
fields with polynomial interactions, is a renormalizable theory if the
analogous commutative theory is renormalizable. We further show that all such
noncommutative theories will have same fixed points and $\beta$-functions for
the couplings, as that of the analogous commutative theory. The unique feature
of these field theories is the twisted statistics obeyed by the particles.
Motivated by it, we look at the possibility of twisted statistics by deforming
internal symmetries instead of spacetime symmetries. We construct two different
twisted theories which can be viewed as internal symmetry analogue of the GM
plane and dipole field theories which arise in the low energy limit of certain
string configurations. We further study their various properties like the issue
of causality and the scattering formalism. Having studied the mathematical
properties of noncommutative and twisted internal symmetries we move on to
discuss their potential phenomenological signatures. We first discuss the
noncommutative thermal correlation functions and show that because of the
twisted statistics, all correlation functions except two-point function get
modified. Finally we discuss the modifications in Hanbury-Brown Twiss (HBT)
correlation functions due to twisted statistics on GM plane and the potential
of observing signatures of noncommutativity by doing a HBT correlation
experiment with Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs).

of cellular signaling, proliferation, and differentiation programs. How such
spatial organization emerges on the growing long bone domain is still
unresolved. Based on the reported biochemical interactions we developed a
regulatory model for the core signaling factors IHH, PTCH1, and PTHrP and
included two cell types, proliferating/resting chondrocytes and
(pre-)hypertrophic chondrocytes. We show that the reported IHH-PTCH1
interaction gives rise to a Schnakenberg-type Turing kinetics, and that
inclusion of PTHrP is important to achieve robust patterning when coupling
patterning and tissue dynamics. The model reproduces relevant spatiotemporal
gene expression patterns, as well as a number of relevant mutant phenotypes. In
summary, we propose that a ligand-receptor based Turing mechanism may control
the emergence of patterns during long bone development, with PTHrP as an
important mediator to confer patterning robustness when the sensitive Turing
system is coupled to the dynamics of a growing and differentiating tissue. We
have previously shown that ligand-receptor based Turing mechanisms can also
result from BMP-receptor and GDNF-receptor interactions, and that these
reproduce the wildtype and mutant patterns during digit formation in limbs and
branching morphogenesis in lung and kidneys. Receptor-ligand interactions may
thus constitute a general mechanism to generate Turing patterns in nature.

the doctrinal boundary of chemistry that a complete shell is inert to reaction.
The oxidations of Xe by various geological substances have been researched in
order to explain the missing Xe in earth atmosphere. Among many proposals, the
chemistry mechanisms are straightforward as they identify chemical processes
that can capture Xe in earth interior. However, all the mechanisms based on
current noble gas chemistry face the same difficulty: the earth lower mantle
and core are rich in metals and therefore their chemical environment is
reductive. On the other hand, up till now, the opposite chemical inclination,
the reductive propensity, i.e. gaining electrons and forming anions, has not
been proposed and examined for noble gas elements. In this work, we
demonstrate, using first principles calculations and an efficient structure
prediction method, that Xe and Kr can form stable MgXe and MgKr compounds under
high pressure. These compounds are intermetallic and Xe or Kr is negatively
charged. We also find that elevated temperature has large effect in stabilizing
MgXe and MgKr compounds. Our results show that the earth has the capability of
capturing Xe but not Kr, which is consistent to the depletion of Xe in earth
atmosphere. The stability of these compounds suggests that chemical species
with completely filled shell may still gain more electrons filling their outer
shell in chemical reactions.

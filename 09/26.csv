revolution. Recent studies that sequenced a very large number of individuals
observed an extreme excess of rare variants, and provided clear evidence of
recent rapid growth in effective population size, though estimates have varied
greatly among studies. All these studies were based on protein-coding genes, in
which variants are also impacted by natural selection. In this study, we
introduce targeted sequencing data for studying recent human history with
minimal confounding by natural selection. We sequenced loci very far from genes
that meet a wide array of additional criteria such that mutations in these loci
are putatively neutral. As population structure also skews allele frequencies,
we sequenced a sample of relatively homogeneous ancestry by first analyzing the
population structure of 9,716 European Americans. We employed very high
coverage sequencing to reliably call rare variants, and fit an extensive array
of models of recent European demographic history to the site frequency
spectrum. The best-fit model estimates ~3.4% growth per generation during the
last ~140 generations, resulting in a population size increase of two orders of
magnitude. This model fits the data very well, largely due to our observation
that assumptions of more ancient demography can impact estimates of recent
growth. This observation and results also shed light on the discrepancy in
demographic estimates among recent studies.

  Principal Component Pursuit",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The stable principal component pursuit (SPCP) is a non-smooth convex
optimization problem, the solution of which enables one to reliably recover the
low rank and sparse components of a data matrix which is corrupted by a dense
noise matrix, even when only a fraction of data entries are observable. In this
paper, we propose a new algorithm for solving SPCP. The proposed algorithm is a
modification of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) where we
use an increasing sequence of penalty parameters instead of a fixed penalty.
The algorithm is based on partial variable splitting and works directly with
the non-smooth objective function. We show that both primal and dual iterate
sequences converge under mild conditions on the sequence of penalty parameters.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first convergence result for a
variable penalty ADMM when penalties are not bounded, the objective function is
non-smooth and its sub-differential is not uniformly bounded. Using partial
variable splitting and adopting an increasing sequence of penalty multipliers,
together, significantly reduce the number of iterations required to achieve
feasibility in practice. Our preliminary computational tests show that the
proposed algorithm works very well in practice, and outperforms ASALM, a state
of the art ADMM algorithm for the SPCP problem with a constant penalty
parameter.

first transition point is the phase transition point for the ferromagnetic
order, and the location is obtained as $p_c^{(1)} \approx 0.895 \, 399 \, 54$
as the solution of $[p^2 + 3 (1-p)^2 ]^2 \, p^3 - \frac{1}{2} = 0$. The second
transition point is the phase transition point for the spin glass order, and
the location is obtained as $p_c^{(2)} = \frac{1}{4} [2 + \sqrt{2 (\sqrt{5} -

concentration, and $1 - p$ is the antiferromagnetic bond concentration. The
obtained locations are reasonably close to the previously estimated locations.
This study suggests the presence of the intermediate phase between $p_c^{(1)}$

but has no mathematical proof for accuracy yet, no conclusions are drawn in

model. The magnetic order can be simulated from an onsite Coulomb interaction
$U$ and the Hund's coupling $J_H$, while the effective pairing interaction
yields the superconductivity with $s\pm$ wave symmetry. The spatial

is suppressed at the second type of TBs which correspond to an asymmetrical
placement of As atoms on the opposite sides of the TB. Furthermore, the

with that of the Galactic disk (6 deg < l < 345 deg, |b| < 2 deg). Using an

green sources is a function of Galactic latitude, with a minimum close to b=0
and increasing with |b| (toward the central part of the Galaxy, 6 deg < l < 345
deg, |b| < 2 deg). We find no significant difference between the correlation
rate of CH3OH masers with green sources in the CMZ and the disk. This suggests
that although the physical conditions of the gas are different in the Galactic
center from that of the Galactic disk, once gravitational instability sets in
at sufficiently high densities, signatures of star formation appear to be
similar in both regions. Moreover, the detection of green sources, even at the
distance of the Galactic center, shows that our technique can easily identify
the early stages of star formation, especially in low extinction regions of the
Galaxy. Through the association of H2O and CH3OH masers, we identify 15
star-forming sites in the CMZ. We find no coincident H2O and CH3OH masers
outside the CMZ (with limited H2O maser survey coverage outside the CMZ),
possibly indicating a difference in the maser evolutionary sequence for
star-forming cores in the Galactic center region and the disk.

properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma created in heavy-ion collisions as they
are produced in initial hard scattering processes and as they experience all
the stages of the medium evolution. The measurement of heavy-flavour production
cross sections in pp collisions at the LHC, besides providing a reference for
heavy-ion studies, allows one to test perturbative QCD calculations. A brief
review of ALICE results on the production of heavy-flavoured hadrons measured
from fully reconstructed hadronic decay topologies in pp collisions at \sqrt{s}
= 7 TeV is presented. Furthermore, heavy-flavour production was also studied as
a function of the particle multiplicity in pp collisions. This could provide
insight into multi-parton scatterings. A measurement of the inclusive J/{\psi}
yield as a function of the charged-particle pseudorapidity density was
performed by the ALICE Collaboration at the LHC in pp collisions at \sqrt{s} =
7 TeV. An increase of the J/{\psi} yield with increasing multiplicity was
observed. In this context, the study of the yield of D mesons as a function of
the charged-particle multiplicity could provide a deeper insight into
charm-quark production in pp collisions. We will present the first results
obtained for prompt D0, D+, and D*+ mesons using hadronic decay channels at
midrapidity in pp collisions \sqrt{s}=7 TeV as a function of the
charged-particle multiplicity. The prompt D-meson yields as a function of
multiplicity are measured in different pT intervals. These yields will be
compared to the results obtained for inclusive and non-prompt J/{\psi}.

a long (>40 kpc) and narrow tail with a nearly constant width (~3 kpc) to the
southeast of the galaxy, and a leading edge ~1.5 kpc from the galaxy center on
the upstream side of the tail. The tail is most likely caused by the nearly
edge-on stripping of ESO 137-002's ISM by ram pressure, compared to the nearly
face-on stripping of ESO 137-001 discussed in our previous work. Spectral
analysis of individual regions along the tail shows that the gas throughout it
has a rather constant temperature, ~1 keV, very close to the temperature of the
tails of ESO 137-001, if the same atomic database is used. The derived gas
abundance is low (~0.2 solar with the single-kT model), an indication of the
multiphase nature of the gas in the tail. The mass of the X-ray tail is only a
small fraction (<5%) of the initial ISM mass of the galaxy, suggesting that the
stripping is most likely at an early stage. However, with any of the single-kT,
double-kT and multi-kT models we tried, the tail is always ""over-pressured""
relative to the surrounding ICM, which could be due to the uncertainties in the
abundance, thermal vs. non-thermal X-ray emission, or magnetic support in the
ICM. The H-alpha data from SOAR show a ~21 kpc tail spatially coincident with
the X-ray tail, as well as a secondary tail (~12 kpc long) to the east of the
main tail diverging at an angle of ~23 degrees and starting at a distance of
~7.5 kpc from the nucleus. At the position of the secondary H-alpha tail, the
X-ray emission is also enhanced at the ~2 sigma level. We compare the tails of
ESO 137-001 and ESO 137-002, and also compare the tails to simulations. Both
the similarities and differences of the tails pose challenges to the

to resolving the AMPS puzzle. Traditional complementarity assumes (A); here we
require that the AMPS experiment measures the correct vacuum entanglement of
Hawking modes, and invoke nonlocal $A=R_B$ type effects to obtain unitarity of
radiation. Fuzzball complementarity is in category (B); here the AMPS
measurement is outside the validity of the approximation required to obtain the

is adaptive in the short turn, and reassesses the probabilities of these events
so that it can modify its long term behaviour appropriately. When food appears,
Wanderer be-comes satiated and exploration temporarily decreases. When a
predator appears, Wanderer both decreases exploration in the short term, and
becomes more ""cautious"" about exploring in the future. Wanderer also forms
associations between neutral features and salient ones (food and predators)

quantum information theory. We adopt a resource-theoretic perspective, wherein
thermodynamics is formulated as a theory of what agents can achieve under a
particular restriction, namely, that the only state preparations and
transformations that they can implement for free are those that are thermal at
some fixed temperature. States that are out of thermal equilibrium are the
resources. We consider the special case of this theory wherein all systems have
trivial Hamiltonians (that is, all of their energy levels are degenerate). In
this case, the only free operations are those that add noise to the system (or
implement a reversible evolution) and the only nonequilibrium states are states
of informational nonequilibrium, that is, states that deviate from the
maximally mixed state. The degree of this deviation we call the state's
nonuniformity; it is the resource of interest here, the fuel that is consumed,
for instance, in an erasure operation. We consider the different types of state
conversion: exact and approximate, single-shot and asymptotic, catalytic and
noncatalytic. In each case, we present the necessary and sufficient conditions
for the conversion to be possible for any pair of states, emphasizing a
geometrical representation of the conditions in terms of Lorenz curves. We also
review the problem of quantifying the nonuniformity of a state, in particular
through the use of generalized entropies. Quantum state conversion problems in
this resource theory can be shown to be always reducible to their classical
counterparts, so that there are no inherently quantum-mechanical features
arising in such problems. This body of work also demonstrates that the standard
formulation of the second law of thermodynamics is inadequate as a criterion
for deciding whether or not a given state transition is possible.

from physics according to ""Mach's ideas"". De Sitter objected to the
""world-matter"" in Einstein's world, and proposed a vacuum solution of
Einstein's field equations with the cosmological constant and with no
""world-matter"". In 1920 the world-matter of Einstein's world was equivalent to
""Mach's Ether"", a carrier of the effects of inertia. De Sitter's 1917 solution
predicted a spectral shift effect. In 1923 Eddington and Weyl adopted De
Sitter's model and studied this effect. Einstein objected to this ""cosmological
problem"". In 1922-1927, Friedmann and Lamaitre published dynamical universe
models. Friedmann's model with cosmological constant equal to zero was the
simplest general relativity universe. Einstein was willing to accept the
mathematics, but not the physics of a dynamical universe. In 1929 Hubble
announced the discovery that the actual universe is apparently expanding. In
1931 Einstein accepted Friedmann's model with a cosmological constant equal to
zero, which he previously abhorred; he claimed that one did not need the
cosmological term anymore. It was very typical to Einstein that he used to do a
theoretical work and he cared about experiments and observations. This paper is
a new interpretation to Einstein's cosmological considerations over the period

required to achieve scattering. We first prove that $n \log n$ random bits are
necessary to scatter $n$ robots in any setting. Also, we give a sufficient
condition for a scattering algorithm to be random bit optimal. As it turns out
that previous solutions for scattering satisfy our condition, they are hence
proved random bit optimal for the scattering problem. Then, we investigate the
time complexity of scattering when strong multiplicity detection is not

the general case and in $o(\log \log n)$ rounds for random bits optimal

put forward a specific protocol of this family that is random bit optimal ($n

This improves the time complexity of previous results in the same setting by a

symmetries and conservation laws via an enhanced prolongation modelled on a
loop algebra valued formal Killing field. As a consequence we establish
Noether's theorem for the CMC system and there is a canonical isomorphism
between the symmetries and conservation laws.
  A geometric interpretation of the $\mathbb{S}^{1}$-family of associate
surfaces leads to an integrable extension for a non-local symmetry called
spectral symmetry. We show that the corresponding spectral conservation law
exists as a secondary characteristic cohomology class.
  For a compact linear finite type CMC surface of arbitrary genus, we observe
that the monodromies of the associated flat
$\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$-connection commute with each other. It follows
that a single spectral curve is defined as the completion of the set of
eigenvalues of the entire monodromies. This agrees with the recent result that
a compact high genus linear finite type CMC surface necessarily factors through
a branched covering of a torus.
  We introduce a sequence of Abel-Jacobi maps defined by the periods of
conservation laws. For the class of deformations of CMC surfaces which scale
the Hopf differential by a real parameter, we compute the first order truncated
Picard-Fuchs equation. The resulting formulae for the first few terms exhibit a
similarity with the Griffiths transversality theorem for variation of Hodge

  Largest revision is reformatting for the Journal of Control and Decision",,,,"cs.SY math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we explore the relationship between dual decomposition and the
consensus-based method for distributed optimization. The relationship is
developed by examining the similarities between the two approaches and their
relationship to gradient-based constrained optimization. By formulating each
algorithm in continuous-time, it is seen that both approaches use a gradient
method for optimization with one using a proportional control term and the
other using an integral control term to drive the system to the constraint set.
Therefore, a significant contribution of this paper is to combine these methods
to develop a continuous-time proportional-integral distributed optimization
method. Furthermore, we establish convergence using Lyapunov stability
techniques and utilizing properties from the network structure of the
multi-agent system.

easy axis. In this case, using the usual spherical polar angles to parametrize
spin coherent states, typically the tunnelling variable is the polar angle
$\theta$, passing from 0 to $\pi$, while the azimuthal angle $\phi$ is
imaginary and constant. As the energy is constant along the tunnelling
trajectory and normalized to vanish, and the Wess-Zumino term $S_{WZ} = is\int
d\tau \thinspace\dot{\phi}(1-\cos\theta )$ also seems to vanish, it is
difficult to see how we can obtain a non-zero contribution to the tunnelling
amplitude. Indeed, the instanton trajectory gives zero contribution. We show
how, the entire contribution to the tunnelling amplitude in fact comes from
moving $\phi$ from zero to its complex value at the beginning of the tunnelling
trajectory at $\theta=0$ and moving it back to zero at the end at $\theta=\pi$.
The Wess-Zumino term can also be expressed in a coordinate system independent
manner as $S_{WZ} =is\int d\tau d\xi \left[\hat n\cdot (\partial_\tau\hat
n\times\partial_\xi\hat n)\right]$, a format that does not appear to be well

this expression corresponds exactly to the more familiar, coordinate system
dependent expression, and how to obtain the tunnelling amplitude directly from
it.

into the metapopulation framework have shown that the heterogeneities that
characterize real mobility networks favor the propagation of epidemics.
Nevertheless, the studies conducted so far assumed the mobility process to be
either Markovian or non-Markovian with a fixed traveling time scale. Available
statistics however show that the time spent by travelers at destination is
characterized by wide fluctuations, ranging between a single day up to several
months. Such varying length of stay crucially affects the chance and duration
of mixing events among hosts and may therefore have a strong impact on the
spread of an emerging disease. Here, we present an analytical and computational
study of epidemic processes on a complex subpopulation network where travelers
have memory of their origin and spend a heterogeneously distributed time
interval at their destination. Through analytical calculations and numerical
simulations we show that the heterogeneity of the length of stay alters the
expression of the threshold between local outbreak and global invasion, and,
moreover, it changes the epidemic behavior of the system in case of a global
outbreak. Additionally, our theoretical framework allows us to study the effect
of changes in the traveling behavior in response to the infection, by
considering a scenario in which sick individuals do not leave their home
location. Finally, we compare the results of our non-Markovian framework with
those obtained with a classic Markovian approach and find relevant differences
between the two, in the estimate of the epidemic invasion potential, as well as
of the timing and the pattern of its spatial spread.

these to rectangular subdomains, and there also exist constructions for domains
with more complex boundaries. However those methods are ineffective when we

in their construction, which allows us to repeat the analysis with many
different realizations of the wavelet bases and averaging the results, a method
that improves the power of the analysis. Next, we apply this type of wavelet

in the literature [R. Goswami and P. S. Joshi, arXiv:gr-qc/0410144],
%\cite{JG04}, whereby a curvature singularity occurs at the collapse end state,
which can be either hidden behind a horizon or be visible to external
observers. However, when the phase-space is deformed, as implemented herein
this paper, we find that the singularity may be either removed or instead,
attained faster. More precisely, for negative values of the deformation
parameter, we identify the emergence of a negative pressure term, which slows
down the collapse so that the singularity is replaced with a bounce. In this
respect, the formation of a dynamical horizon can be avoided depending on the
suitable choice of the boundary surface of the star. Whereas for positive
values, the pressure that originates from the deformation effects assists the
collapse toward the singularity formation. In this case, since the collapse
speed is unbounded, the condition on the horizon formation is always satisfied
and furthermore the dynamical horizon develops earlier than when the
phase-space deformations are absent. These results are obtained by means of a
thoroughly numerical discussion.

discuss their collider search strategies. This category of exotic Higgs decays
are characterized by the collider signature: visible objects + $\mbox{${\not\!

escaping dark matter particles. Their benchmark arises naturally in the
Peccei-Quinn symmetry limit of the MSSM singlet-extensions, which is typified
by the co-existence of three light particles: singlet-like scalar $h_1$ and
pseudoscalar $a_1$, and singlino-like neutralino $\chi_1$, all with masses of
$\lesssim 10$ GeV, and the generically suppression of the exotic decays of the
125 GeV Higgs boson $h_2\to h_1 h_1$, $a_1a_1$ and $\chi_1\chi_1$, however. As
an illustration, we study the decay topology: $h_2 \to \chi_1 \chi_2$, where
the bino-like $\chi_2$ decays to $h_1 \chi_1$ or $a_1 \chi_1$, and $h_1/a_1 \to
f\bar f$, with $f\bar f = \mu^+\mu^-$, $b\bar b$. In the di-muon case
($m_{h_1/a_1} \sim 1$ GeV), a statistical sensitivity of $\frac{S}{\sqrt{B}} >

function are top-heavy in galaxies with high star-formation rates (SFRs).
Calculating the integrated galactic stellar initial mass function (IGIMF) as a
function of the SFR of a galaxy, it follows that galaxies which have or which
formed with SFRs > 10 Msol yr^-1 would have a top-heavy IGIMF in excellent
consistency with the observations. Consequently and in agreement with
observations, elliptical galaxies would have higher M/L ratios as a result of
the overabundance of stellar remnants compared to a stellar population that
formed with an invariant canonical stellar initial mass function (IMF). For the
Milky Way, the IGIMF yields very good agreement with the disk- and the
bulge-IMF determinations. Our conclusions are that purely stochastic
descriptions of star formation on the scales of a pc and above are falsified.
Instead, star formation follows the laws, stated here as axioms, which define
the IGIMF theory. We also find evidence that the power-law index beta of the
embedded cluster mass function decreases with increasing SFR. We propose
further tests of the IGIMF theory through counting massive stars in dwarf
galaxies.

of NSs with a flexible modeling approach that can effectively accommodate a
skewed underlying distribution and asymmetric measurement errors. We find that
NSs that have evolved through different evolutionary paths reflect distinctive

double neutron star and neutron star-white dwarf systems show consistent
respective peaks at 1.33 Msun and 1.55 Msun suggesting significant mass
accretion (delta m~0.22 Msun) has occurred during the spin-up phase. The width
of the mass distribution implied by double NS systems is indicative of a tight
initial mass function while the inferred mass range is significantly wider for
NSs that have gone through recycling. We find a mass cutoff at ~2.1 Msun for
NSs with white dwarf companions which establishes a firm lower bound for the
maximum NS mass. This rules out the majority of strange quark and soft equation
of state models as viable configurations for NS matter. The lack of truncation
close to the maximum mass cutoff along with the skewed nature of the inferred
mass distribution both enforce the suggestion that the 2.1 Msun limit is set by
evolutionary constraints rather than nuclear physics or general relativity, and
the existence of rare super-massive NSs is possible.

brightness, and velocity dispersion of early-type galaxies. This relation has
been studied extensively for early-type galaxies in the local universe to
constrain galaxy formation mechanisms. The evolution of the zeropoint of this
plane has been extended to high redshifts to study the luminosity evolution of
massive galaxies, under the assumption of structural homology. In this work, we
assess this assumption by replacing surface brightness with stellar mass
density and present the evolution of the ""mass FP"" for massive, quiescent
galaxies since z~2. By accounting for stellar populations, we thereby isolate
and trace structural and dynamical evolution. Despite the observed dramatic
evolution in the sizes and morphologies of massive galaxies since z~3, we find
that quiescent galaxies lie on the mass FP out to z~2. In contrast with ~1.4
dex evolution in the luminosity FP, average residuals from the z~0 mass FP are
less than ~0.15 dex since z~2. Assuming the Hyde & Bernardi (2009) mass FP
slope, we find that this minimal offset scales as (1+z)^{-0.095+/-0.043}. This
result lends credence to previous studies that derived luminosity evolution
from the FP. Therefore, despite their compact sizes and suggestions that
massive galaxies are more disk-like at z~2, the relationship between their
dynamics and structural properties are consistent with local early-type
galaxies. Finally, we find no strong evidence for a tilt of the mass FP
relative to the Virial plane, but emphasize the need for full models including

discreteness, stochasticity, and exclusion, achieved by averaging over hundreds
of possible sets of initial small-scale modes, while holding fixed large-scale
modes that give the cosmic web. We find (i) that dark-matter-halo formation is
greatly suppressed in voids; there is an exponential downturn at low densities
in the otherwise power-law matter-to-halo density bias function. Thus, the
rarity of haloes in voids is akin to the rarity of the largest clusters, and
their abundance is quite sensitive to cosmological parameters. The exponential
downturn appears both in an excursion-set model, and in a model in which
fluctuations evolve in voids as in an open universe with an effective
$\Omega_m$ proportional to a large-scale density. We also find that (ii) haloes
typically populate the average halo-density field in a super-Poisson way, i.e.
with a variance exceeding the mean; and (iii) the rank-order-Gaussianized halo
and dark-matter fields are impressively similar in Fourier space. We compare
both their power spectra and cross-correlation, supporting the conclusion that
one is roughly a strictly-increasing mapping of the other. The MIP ensemble
especially reveals how halo abundance varies with `environmental' quantities

High-redshift BCGs/MMCGs were, in many cases, star-forming, late-type galaxies,
with blue broadband colors, properties largely absent amongst the low-redshift
BCGs/MMCGs. The stellar mass of BCGs was found to increase by an average factor
of $2.51\pm0.71$ from $z\sim0.9$ to $z\sim0.1$. Through this and other

stellar mass in BCGs/MMCGs. The stellar mass growth of the BCGs/MMCGs also
appears to grow in lockstep with both the stellar baryonic and total mass of

rectangles is a basic problem in computational geom- etry and combinatorics.
This problem has attracted significant atten- tion since the sixties, when
Wegner conjectured that the corresponding duality gap, i.e., the maximum
possible ratio between the maximum independent set and the minimum hitting set
(MHS), is bounded by a universal constant. An interesting special case, that
may prove use- ful to tackling the general problem, is the
diagonal-intersecting case, in which the given family of rectangles is
intersected by a diagonal. Indeed, Chepoi and Felsner recently gave a factor 6
approximation algorithm for MHS in this setting, and showed that the duality
gap is between 3/2 and 6. In this paper we improve upon these results. First we
show that MIS in diagonal-intersecting families is NP-complete, providing one
smallest subclass for which MIS is provably hard. Then, we derive an
$O(n^2)$-time algorithm for the maximum weight independent set when, in
addition the rectangles intersect below the diagonal. This improves and extends
a classic result of Lubiw, and amounts to obtain a 2-approximation algo- rithm
for the maximum weight independent set of rectangles intersecting a diagonal.
Finally, we prove that for diagonal-intersecting families the duality gap is
between 2 and 4. The upper bound, which implies an approximation algorithm of
the same factor, follows from a simple com- binatorial argument, while the
lower bound represents the best known lower bound on the duality gap, even in
the general case.

consistent set of temperatures and compositions from which self-consistent
models can be compared and to probe the underlying processes that shape these
atmospheres. This paper is the second in a three part series of papers
exploring the retrievability of temperatures and abundances from secondary
eclipse spectra and the implications of these results for the chemistry of
exoplanet atmospheres. In this investigation we present a catalogue of
temperatures and abundances for H$_2$O, CH$_4$, CO, and CO$_2$. We find that
our temperatures and abundances are generally consistent with those of previous
studies, although we do not find any statistically convincing evidence for
super-solar C to O ratios (e.g., solar C/O falls in the 1-sigma confidence
intervals in eight of the nine planets in our sample). Furthermore, within our
sample we find little evidence for thermal inversions over a wide range of
effective temperatures (with the exception of HD209458b), consistent with
previous investigations. The lack of evidence for inversions for most planets
in our sample over such a wide range of effective temperatures provides
additional support for the hypothesis that TiO is unlikely to be the absorber
responsible for the formation of these inversions.

Jovian-like atmosphere is in chemical disequilibrium from observations of
detectable or inferred gases such as H$_2$O, CH$_4$, CO, and H$_2$. Our
hypothesis, based on previous kinetic modeling studies, is that cooler
atmospheres will show stronger signs of disequilibrium than hotter atmospheres.
We verify this with chemistry-transport models and show that planets with
temperatures less than $\sim$1200 K are likely to show the strongest signs of
disequilibrium due to the vertical quenching of CO, and that our new approach
is able to capture this process. We also find that in certain instances a
planetary composition may appear in equilibrium when it actually is not due to
the degeneracy in the shape of the vertical mixing ratio profiles. We determine
the state of disequilibrium in eight exoplanets using the results from
secondary eclipse temperature and abundance retrievals. We find that all of the
planets in our sample are consistent with thermochemical equilibrium to within
3-sigma. Future observations are needed to further constrain the abundances in
order to definitively identify disequilibrium in exoplanet atmospheres.

such social learning over a network is the ruinous multiple re-use of
information known as data incest (or mis-information propagation). In this
paper, the data incest management problem in social learning context is
formulated on a directed acyclic graph. We give necessary and sufficient
conditions on the graph topology of social interactions to eliminate data
incest. A data incest removal algorithm is proposed such that the public belief

general text in images remains a challenging research problem. Motivated by the
need to consider the widely varying forms of natural text, we propose a
bottom-up approach to the problem which reflects the `characterness' of an
image region. In this sense our approach mirrors the move from saliency
detection methods to measures of `objectness'. In order to measure the
characterness we develop three novel cues that are tailored for character
detection, and a Bayesian method for their integration. Because text is made up
of sets of characters, we then design a Markov random field (MRF) model so as
to exploit the inherent dependencies between characters.
  We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our characterness cues as
well as the advantage of Bayesian multi-cue integration. The proposed text
detector outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a few benchmark scene text
detection datasets. We also show that our measurement of `characterness' is
superior than state-of-the-art saliency detection models when applied to the

locations. Extracellular signals bias the direction of movement by biasing the
extension of protrusions, but this involves another layer of biochemical
networks for signal detection, transduction, and control of the rebuilding of
the cytoskeleton. Here we develop a model for the latter processes that centers
on a Ras-based module that adapts to constant extracellular signals and
controls the downstream PI3K-PIP3-based module responsible for amplifying a
spatial gradient of the signal. The resulting spatial gradient can lead to
polarization, which enables cells to move in the preferred direction (up
gradient for attractants and down-gradient for repellents). We show that the

cAMP stimulation for Dictyostelium, and analyze how cell geometry and signaling
interact to produce the observed localization of some of the key components of

are accurate, long, continuous and of broad spatial coverage. Since
instrumental measurements are generally only available after 1850, temperature
fields must be reconstructed using paleoclimate archives, known as proxies.
Various climate field reconstructions (CFR) methods have been proposed to
relate past temperature to such proxy networks. In this work, we propose a new
CFR method, called GraphEM, based on Gaussian Markov random fields embedded
within an EM algorithm. Gaussian Markov random fields provide a natural and
flexible framework for modeling high-dimensional spatial fields. At the same
time, they provide the parameter reduction necessary for obtaining precise and
well-conditioned estimates of the covariance structure, even in the
sample-starved setting common in paleoclimate applications. In this paper, we
propose and compare the performance of different methods to estimate the
graphical structure of climate fields, and demonstrate how the GraphEM
algorithm can be used to reconstruct past climate variations. The performance
of GraphEM is compared to the widely used CFR method RegEM with regularization
via truncated total least squares, using synthetic data. Our results show that
GraphEM can yield significant improvements, with uniform gains over space, and
far better risk properties. We demonstrate that the spatial structure of
temperature fields can be well estimated by graphs where each neighbor is only
connected to a few geographically close neighbors, and that the increase in
performance is directly related to recovering the underlying sparsity in the
covariance of the spatial field. Our work demonstrates how significant
improvements can be made in climate reconstruction methods by better modeling
the covariance structure of the climate field.

probability to have an infinite volume is greater than zero. Using this
definition, we study the Laplace transform of \rho(V) numerically to determine
the condition that triggers the transition to eternal inflation. We also study
the average volume <V> analytically and show that it satisfies the universal
volume bound. This bound states that, in any realization of inflation which
ends with a finite volume, an initial volume must grow by less than a factor of

\tilde{\tau}_1\tilde{\tau}_2^\ast+\tilde{\tau}_1^\ast\tilde{\tau}_2. The
branching fractions are less than 10% for H^0 -> h^0h^0 and 1% for A^0 -> h^0Z

the exclusion limit of leading MSSM Higgs search channel, namely gg,b\bar{b} ->

study the effects of calculating the payoff from pairing up with one random
player from among the neighboring players. Based on probability theory, in a
situation of uncorrelated events, the average payoff that involves all of the
neighbors should,in principal,be equivalent to the payoff from pairing up with
one neighbor.However,our simulation of games on graphs shows that, in many
cases,the two payoff schemes lead to qualitatively different levels of
cooperation.This finding appears to provide a possible explanation for a wide
spectrum of observed behaviors in the literature.We have also observed that
results from the randomly-pairing-one mechanism are more robust than the
involving-all-neighbours mechanism because,in the former case, neither the
other three main elements nor the initial states of the players have a large
impact on the final level of cooperation compared with in the latter case.

technique employed in the industry in order to enhance the thermal and
mechanical properties of the final ceramic products. A proper understanding of
this phenomenon is quite challenging since it stems from the reciprocal action
and reaction between fluid flow, the transition to wetting, mass transport,
precipitation, surface growth as well as heat transfer. As a result, the
exhaustive modeling of such problem is an involved task. Lattice Boltzmann
simulations in 2D for capillary infiltration are carried out in the isothermal
regime taking into account surface reaction and subsequent surface growth.
Precisely, for a single capillary in the linear Washburn regime, special
attention is paid to the retardation for the infiltration process induced by
the thickening of the surface behind the contact line of the invading front.
Interestingly, it turns out that the process of surface growth leading to pore
closure marginally depends on the infiltration velocity. We conclude that
porous matrices with straight and wide pathways represent the optimal case for
impregnation. Our analysis includes also a comparison between the radii
characterizing the infiltration process (i.e., minimum, hydraulic, average and
effective radii).

are related to three DoF bounds: 1) the decomposition DoF bound
d^{Decom}=MN/(M+KN), a lower-bound of linear interference alignment (IA) with
infinite time/frequency extensions (called asymptotic IA); 2) the proper DoF
bound d^{Proper}=(M+N)/(GK+1), an upper-bound of linear IA without
time/frequency extensions (called linear IA); and 3) the quantity DoF bound
d^{Quan}, a zigzag piecewise linear function of M and N. The whole region of
M/N can be divided into two regions, Region I and Region II. Specifically, for
most configurations in Region I, the information theoretic maximal DoF are the
decomposition DoF bound and can be achieved by the asymptotic IA. For all
configurations in Region II, the information theoretic maximal DoF are the
quantity DoF bound and can be achieved by the linear IA. To obtain the tight
upper-bound, we propose a unified way to construct genies, where the genies
help each base station or user resolve the maximal number of interference.
According to the feature that the designed genies with the same dimension can
derive identical DoF upper-bound, we convert the information theoretic DoF
upper-bound problem into a linear algebra problem and obtain the closed-form
DoF upper-bound expression. Moreover, we develop a non-iterative linear IA
transceiver to achieve the DoF upper-bound for the networks with antenna
configurations in Region II, which means that the derived DoF upper-bound is
tightest. The basic principles to derive the DoF upper-bound and design the
linear IA transceiver to achieve the DoF upper-bound can be extended into
general asymmetric networks.

locations are modeled using a homogenous spatial Poisson point process. The
received signals are impaired by both fading and location dependent path loss.
For this system, we first derive an expression for the beam outage probability.
This expression holds for all path loss models that satisfy some mild
conditions. Then, we focus on two specific path loss models (i.e., an unbounded
model and a more realistic bounded one) to illustrate the applications of our
results. In the large system limit where the cell radius tends to infinity, the
beam outage capacity and its scaling behavior are derived for the selected
specific path loss models. It is shown that the beam outage capacity scales
logarithmically for the unbounded model. On the other hand, this scaling
behavior becomes double logarithmic for the bounded model. Intuitive
explanations are provided as to why we observe different scaling behavior for
different path loss models. Numerical evaluations are performed to give further
insights, and to illustrate the applicability of the outage capacity results

between the abundance ratios of EMP stars and certain explosion properties of

smaller ejected Fe mass and the larger compact remnant mass, respectively.
Using these relations, the distributions of the abundance ratios of EMP stars
are converted to those of the explosion properties of Pop III SNe. Such
distributions are compared with those of the explosion properties of present

dihadron correlations from HIJING simulations have a typical structure from
minijets that contains a near-side two-dimensional peak and an away-side ridge
along the $\eta$-direction. In contrast, event-by-event (3+1)D ideal
hydrodynamic simulations with fluctuating initial conditions from the
HIJING+AMPT model produce a strong dihadron correlation that has an away-side
as well as a near-side ridge. Relics of intrinsic dihadron correlation from
minijets in the initial conditions still remain as superimposed on the two
ridges. By varying initial conditions from HIJING+AMPT, we study effects of
minijets, non-vanishing initial flow and longitudinal fluctuation on the final
state dihadron correlations. With a large rapidity gap, one can exclude
near-side correlations from minijet relics and dihadron correlations can be
described by the superposition of harmonic flows up to the 6th order. When
long-range correlations with a large rapidity gap are subtracted from
short-range correlations with a small rapidity gap, the remaining near-side
dihadron correlations result solely from relics of minijets. Low transverse
momentum hadron yields per trigger ($p_T^{\rm trig} <4$ GeV/$c$, $p_T^{\rm
asso}<2$ GeV/$c$) in central heavy-ion collisions are significantly enhanced
over that in p+p collisions while widths in azimuthal angle remain the same, in
qualitative agreement with experimental data.

information processors, with the potential to solve computationally intractable
problems at the scale of just a few dozen interacting quantum systems. Recent
experiments in a range of technical platforms have demonstrated the basic
functionality of quantum simulation applied to quantum magnetism, quantum phase
transitions, and relativistic quantum mechanics. In all cases, the underlying
hardware platforms restrict the achievable inter-particle interaction, forming
a serious constraint on the ability to realize a versatile, programmable
quantum simulator. In this work, we address this problem by developing novel
sequences of unitary operations that engineer desired effective Hamiltonians in
the time-domain. The result is a hybrid programmable analog simulator
permitting a broad class of interacting spin-lattice models to be generated
starting only with an arbitrary long-range native inter-particle interaction
and single-qubit addressing. Specifically, our approach permits the generation
of all symmetrically coupled translation-invariant two-body Hamiltonians with
homogeneous on-site terms, a class which includes all spin-1/2 XYZ chains, but
generalized to include long-range couplings. Building on previous work proving
that universal simulation is possible using both entangling gates and
single-qubit unitaries, we show that determining the ""program"" of unitary
pulses to implement an arbitrary spin Hamiltonian can be formulated as a linear
program that runs in polynomial time and scales efficiently in hardware
resources. Our analysis extends from circuit model quantum information to
adiabatic quantum evolutions, where our approach allows for the creation of
non-native ground state solutions to a computation.

subdiffusive transport emerges due to an interplay of nonlinear response and
viscoelastic effects for fractional Brownian motion in periodic potentials with
broken space-inversion symmetry and driven by a time-periodic field. The
anomalous transport becomes optimal for a subthreshold driving when the driving
period matches a characteristic time scale of interwell transitions. It can
also be optimized by varying temperature, amplitude of periodic potential and
driving strength. The useful work done against a load shows a parabolic
dependence on the load strength. It grows sublinearly with time and the
corresponding thermodynamic efficiency decays algebraically in time because the
energy supplied by the driving field scales with time linearly. However, it
compares well with the efficiency of normal diffusion rocking ratchets on an

a finely tuned longitudinal magnetic field and (2) a conductivity which always
increases with sample size, and both are independent of disorder strength. We
numerically study how these experimental transport signatures are affected by
bulk physics in the interior of the topological insulator sample. We show that
both signatures of the topological metal are robust against bulk effects.
However the bulk does substantially accelerate the metal's decay in a magnetic

tuned to resonance with the bulk band the conductivity follows the predictions
of scaling theory, indicating that conduction is diffusive. At other disorder
strengths the bulk reduces the effects of surface disorder and scaling theory

we argue that elites are not only composed of highly connected individuals, but
also of intermediaries connecting hubs to form a cohesive and structured

generalization of the $K$-core algorithm that allows to identify a social core
that is composed of well-connected hubs together with their `connectors'. We
show the validity of the idea in the framework of a virtual world defined by a
massive multiplayer online game, on which we have complete information of
various social networks. Exploiting this multiplex structure, we find that the
hubs of the generalized $K$-core identify those individuals that are high
social performers in terms of a series of indicators that are available in the
game. In addition, using a combined strategy which involves the generalized
$K$-core and the recently introduced $M$-core, the elites of the different
'nations' present in the game are perfectly identified as modules of the
generalized $K$-core. Interesting sudden shifts in the composition of the elite
cores are observed at deep levels. We show that elite detection with the
traditional $K$-core is not possible in a reliable way. The proposed method

numerical evaluation of high-dimensional integrals that uses the sequential
structure of target integrands to build variance minimising importance
samplers. Despite a number of successful applications in high dimensions, it is
well known that importance sampling strategies are subject to an exponential
growth in variance as the dimension of the integration increases. We solve this
problem by recognising that the EIS framework has an offline sequential Monte
Carlo interpretation. The particle EIS method is based on non-standard
resampling weights that take into account the look-ahead construction of the
importance sampler. We apply the method for a range of univariate and bivariate
stochastic volatility specifications. We also develop a new application of the
EIS approach to state space models with Student's t state innovations. Our
results show that the particle EIS method strongly outperforms both the
standard EIS method and particle filters for likelihood evaluation in high
dimensions. Moreover, the ratio between the variances of the particle EIS and
particle filter methods remains stable as the time series dimension increases.
We illustrate the efficiency of the method for Bayesian inference using the

important near the critical scattering length, where the lifetime of the

Brownian quasi-particles elastically coupled to the transport particle and
characterized by a hierarchy of relaxation times which obey a fractal scaling.
The most slowly relaxing deformations which cannot immediately follow to the

cause subdiffusion and anomalous transport on a sufficiently long time scale.
This anomalous behavior is combined with normal diffusion and transport on an
initial time scale of overdamped motion. Anomalously slow directed transport in
a periodic ratchet potential with broken space inversion symmetry emerges due
to a violation of the thermal detailed balance by a zero-mean periodic driving
and is optimized with frequency of driving, its amplitude, and temperature.
Such optimized anomalous transport can be low dispersive and characterized by a
large generalized Peclet number. Moreover, we show that overdamped subdiffusive
ratchets can sustain a substantial load and do a useful work. The corresponding
thermodynamic efficiency decays algebraically in time since the useful work
done against a load scales sublinearly with time following to the transport
particle position, but the energy pumped by an external force scales with time
linearly. Nevertheless, it can be transiently appreciably high and compare well
with the thermodynamical efficiency of the normal diffusion overdamped ratchets

on the opacity of the Universe to gamma rays, possibly related to the anomalies
in the spectral indices of distant gamma-ray sources. In the scenario where
ALPs from distant sources convert back to photons in the Galactic magnetic

intergalactic medium.

Error) is inferior to 1{\deg}C. For the wind speed, it is ~2 m/s, and for the
wind direction, it is in the range [38-46{\deg}], at all levels, that
corresponds to a RMSE_relative in a range [21-26{\deg}]. If a filter is applied
for the wind direction (the winds inferior to 3 m/s are discarded from the
computations), the wind direction RMSE is in the range [30-41{\deg}], i.e. a
RMSE_relative in the range [17-23{\deg}]. The model operational forecast of the
surface layer atmospherical parameters is suitable for different applications,
among others: thermalization of the dome using the reconstructed temperature,
hours in advance, of the beginning the night; knowing in advance the main
direction which the strong winds will come from during the night could allow
the astronomer to anticipate the occurrence of a good/bad seeing night, and
plan the observations accordingly; preventing adaptive secondary mirrors shake
generated by the wind speed.

postulate the triangle principle which states that any information distance is
well defined on any pair of measurements, even if the two measurements cannot
be jointly performed. As a consequence, the triangle inequality for this
distance is obeyed for any three measurements. This simple principle is valid
in any classical realistic theory, however it does not hold in quantum theory.
It allows us to re-derive in an astonishingly simple way a large class of
non-contextuality and local realistic inequalities via multiple applications of
the triangle inequality. We also show that this principle can be applied to
derive monogamy relations. The triangle principle is different than the
assumption of non-contextuality and local realism, which is defined as a lack
of existence of a joined probability distribution giving rise to all measurable
data. Therefore, we show that one can design Bell-Kochen-Specker tests using a
different principle.

singularities, called hyperconifolds, that are finite quotients of the
conifold. First, it is shown that hyperconifold singularities arise naturally
in limits of smooth, compact Calabi--Yau threefolds (in particular), when the
group action on the covering space develops a fixed point. The
Z_n-hyperconifolds---those for which the quotient group is cyclic---are
classified, demonstrating a one-to-one correspondence between these
singularities and three-dimensional lens spaces L(n,k), which occur as the
vanishing cycles. The classification is constructive, and leads to a simple
proof that a Z_n-hyperconifold is mirror to an n-nodal variety. It is then
argued that all factorial Z_n-hyperconifolds have crepant, projective
resolutions, and this gives rise to transitions between smooth compact
Calabi--Yau threefolds, which are mirror to certain conifold transitions.
Formulae are derived for the change in both fundamental group and Hodge numbers
under such hyperconifold transitions.
  Finally, a number of explicit examples are given, to illustrate how to
construct new Calabi--Yau manifolds using hyperconifold transitions, and also
to highlight the differences which can occur when these singularities occur in
non-factorial varieties.

(LIRGs). We also analyse the radial distribution of CCSNe in these galaxies,
and determine power-law and exponential fits to CCSN surface density profiles.
To probe differences between the SNe of these galaxies and normal spiral
galaxies, our results were compared to previous studies with samples dominated
by normal spiral galaxies where possible. We obtained a normalised scale length
of 0.23^{+0.03}_{-0.02} R_25 for the CCSN surface density in IR-bright
galaxies; less than that derived for CCSNe in a sample dominated by normal
spiral galaxies (0.29 \pm 0.01). This reflects a more centrally concentrated
population of massive stars in IR-bright galaxies. Furthermore, this
centralisation is dominated by a central excess of type Ibc/IIb SNe. This may
be due to a top-heavy initial mass function and/or an enhanced close binary
fraction in regions of enhanced star formation. Type Ic SNe are most strongly
correlated with Ha light and NUV-bright regions, reflecting the shortest
lifetime and thus highest mass for type Ic progenitors. Previous studies with
samples dominated by normal spiral galaxies have indicated a lower Ibc-Ha
correlation than our results do, which may be due to the central excess of type
Ibc/IIb SNe in our sample. The difference between types II and Ib is minimal,
suggesting that progenitor mass is not the dominant factor in determining if a
SN is of type Ib or II. Similar differences in correlation can be seen in the
Ks-band, with type Ibc/IIb SNe tracing the Ks-band light better than type II in

general modified gravity models. As a specific application, we present
theoretical predictions of the redshift-space power spectra in f(R) gravity

takes into account the effects of both modifications of gravity and RSD

detect the scale dependence of the growth rate in a model-independent way based

densification and the intense proliferation of wireless devices, modern
wireless networks are interference-limited, which motivates the use of
interference mitigation and coordination techniques. In this work, we develop a
statistical framework to evaluate the performance of multi-tier heterogeneous
networks with successive interference cancellation (SIC) capabilities,
accounting for the computational complexity of the cancellation scheme and
relevant network related parameters such as random location of the access
points (APs) and mobile users, and the characteristics of the wireless
propagation channel. We explicitly model the consecutive events of canceling
interferers and we derive the success probability to cancel the n-th strongest
signal and to decode the signal of interest after n cancellations. When users
are connected to the AP which provides the maximum average received signal
power, the analysis indicates that the performance gains of SIC diminish
quickly with n and the benefits are modest for realistic values of the
signal-to-interference ratio (SIR). We extend the statistical model to include
several association policies where distinct gains of SIC are expected: (i)
minimum load association, (ii) maxi- mum instantaneous SIR association, and
(iii) range expansion. Numerical results show the effectiveness of SIC for the
considered association policies. This work deepens the understanding of SIC by
defining the achievable gains for different association policies in multi-tier

slope agree well with experimentally extracted values. Folded microscopic
potentials using this effective interaction, whose density dependence is

has started operation in 2009, typical electron cloud phenomena have appeared
also in this machine, when running with trains of closely packed bunches (i.e.
with spacings below 150ns). Beside the above mentioned indicators, other
typical signatures were seen in this machine (due to its operation mode and/or
more refined detection possibilities), like heat load in the cold dipoles,
bunch dependent emittance growth and degraded lifetime in store and
bunch-by-bunch stable phase shift to compensate for the energy loss due to the

non-cooperative agents build and maintain one-to-many network communication.
There is a special source node and a collection of agents located at
corresponding terminals. Each agent is interested in selecting a route from the
special source to its terminal minimizing the cost. The mutual influence of the
agents is determined by a cost sharing mechanism, which evenly splits the cost
of an edge among all the agents using it for routing. In this paper we provide
several algorithmic and complexity results on finding a Nash equilibrium
minimizing the value of Rosenthal potential. Let n be the number of agents and
G be the communication network. We show that
  - For a given strategy profile s and integer k>=1, there is a local search
algorithm which in time n^{O(k)}|G|^{O(1)} finds a better strategy profile, if
there is any, in a k-exchange neighbourhood of s. In other words, the algorithm
decides if Rosenthal potential can be decreased by changing strategies of at
most k agents;
  - The running time of our local search algorithm is essentially tight: unless
FPT= W[1], for any function f(k), searching of the k-neighbourhood cannot be
done in time f(k)|G|^{O(1)}.
  The key ingredient of our algorithmic result is a subroutine that finds an
equilibrium with minimum potential in 3^n|G|^{O(1)} time. In other words,
finding an equilibrium with minimum potential is fixed-parameter tractable when
parameterized by the number of agents.

self-consistent dynamo action, is dominated by a retrograde m=1 mode. Its
pattern speed is nearly independent of latitude and does not reflect the speed
of the differential rotation at any depth. The extrema of magnetic m=1

attention in recent years. The traditional convex formulation employs the group
Lasso relaxation to achieve joint sparsity across tasks. Although this approach
leads to a simple convex formulation, it suffers from several issues due to the
looseness of the relaxation. To remedy this problem, we view jointly sparse
multi-task learning as a specialized random effects model, and derive a convex
relaxation approach that involves two steps. The first step learns the
covariance matrix of the coefficients using a convex formulation which we refer
to as sparse covariance coding; the second step solves a ridge regression
problem with a sparse quadratic regularizer based on the covariance matrix
obtained in the first step. It is shown that this approach produces an
asymptotically optimal quadratic regularizer in the multitask learning setting
when the number of tasks approaches infinity. Experimental results demonstrate
that the convex formulation obtained via the proposed model significantly

can possess different features at the same time, such as in wave-particle
duality or quantum superposition. In recent delayed-choice experiments, a
quantum mechanical system can be observed to manifest one feature such as the
wave or particle nature, depending on the final measurement setup, which is
chosen after the system itself has already entered the measuring device; hence
its behaviour is not predetermined. Here, we adapt this paradigmatic scheme to
multi-dimensional quantum walks. In our experiment, the way in which a photon
interferes with itself in a strongly non-trivial pattern depends on its
polarisation, that is determined after the photon has already been detected.
Multi-dimensional quantum walks are a very powerful tool for simulating the
behaviour of complex quantum systems, due to their versatility. This is the
first experiment realising a multi-dimensional quantum walk with a
single-photon source and we present also the first experimental simulation of
the Grover walk, a model that can be used to implement the Grover quantum
search algorithm.

Recently, a new type of graphical model, called the nested Markov model, was
developed which captures equality constraints found in marginals of directed
acyclic graph (DAG) models. Some of these constraints, such as the so called
`Verma constraint', strictly generalize conditional independence. To make
modeling and inference with nested Markov models practical, it is necessary to
limit the number of parameters in the model, while still correctly capturing
the constraints in the marginal of a DAG model. Placing such limits is similar
in spirit to sparsity methods for undirected graphical models, and regression

axisymmetric motion of string loops when the motion can be fully governed by an
appropriately defined effective potential related to the energy and angular
momentum of the string loops. In dependence on these two constants of the
motion, the string loops can be captured, trapped, or can escape to infinity.
In close vicinity of stable equilibrium points at the centre of trapped states
the motion is regular. We describe how it is transformed to chaotic motion with
growing energy of the string loop. In the field of naked singularities the
trapped states located off the equatorial plane of the system exist and
trajectories unable to cross the equatorial plane occur, contrary to the
trajectories in the field of black holes where crossing the equatorial plane is
always admitted. We concentrate our attention to the so called transmutation
effect when the string loops are accelerated in the deep gravitational field
near the black hole or naked singularity by transforming the oscillatory energy
to the energy of the transitional motion. We demonstrate that the influence of
the tidal charge can be substantial especially in the naked singularity

the grid stretching in the streamwise and lateral directions and the subgrid

results of a highly resolved LES (HRLES) and for different quantities of
interest, namely the mean streamwise velocity, the momentum thickness and the
shear stress. A typical feature of the considered spatially evolving flow is
the progressive transition from a laminar regime, highly dependent on the inlet
conditions, to a fully-developed turbulent one. Therefore the computational
domain is divided in two different zones (\textit{inlet dependent} and
\textit{fully turbulent}) and the gPC error analysis is carried out for these
two zones separately. An optimization of the parameters is also carried out for
both these zones. For all the considered quantities, the results point out that
the error is mainly governed by the value of the $C_S$ constant. At the end of

is significantly larger in the inlet-dependent upstream region; however, low

system. The core of IDP3 is a finite model generator that supports first order
logic enriched with types, inductive definitions, aggregates and partial
functions. It offers its users a modeling language that is a slight extension
of predicate logic and allows them to solve a wide range of search problems.
Apart from a small introductory example, applications are selected from
problems that arose within machine learning and data mining research. These
research areas have recently shown a strong interest in declarative modeling
and constraint solving as opposed to algorithmic approaches. The paper
illustrates that the IDP3 system can be a valuable tool for researchers with
such an interest.
  The first problem is in the domain of stemmatology, a domain of philology
concerned with the relationship between surviving variant versions of text. The
second problem is about a somewhat related problem within biology where
phylogenetic trees are used to represent the evolution of species. The third
and final problem concerns the classical problem of learning a minimal
automaton consistent with a given set of strings. For this last problem, we
show that the performance of our solution comes very close to that of a
state-of-the art solution. For each of these applications, we analyze the
problem, illustrate the development of a logic-based model and explore how
alternatives can affect the performance.

for type Ia supernovae. In spite of their (a priori) rareness, in highly
populated globular clusters and in galactic centers, where the amount of white
dwarfs is considerable, the rate of violent collisions between two of them
might be non-negligible. Even more, there are indications that binary white
dwarf systems orbited by a third stellar-mass body have an important chance to
induce a clean head-on collision. Therefore, this scenario represents a source
of contamination for the supernova light-curves sample that it is used as
standard candles in cosmology, and it deserves further investigation. Some
groups have conducted numerical simulations of this scenario, but their results
show several differences. In this paper we address some of the possible sources
of these differences, presenting the results of high resolution hydrodynamical
simulations jointly with a detailed nuclear post-processing of the nuclear
abundances, to check the viability of white dwarf collisions to produce
significant amounts of 56Ni. To that purpose, we use a 2D-axial symmetric
smoothed particle hydrodynamic code to obtain a resolution considerably higher
than in previous studies. In this work, we also study how the initial mass and
nuclear composition affect the results. The gravitational wave emission is also
calculated, as this is a unique signature of this kind of events. All
calculated models produce a significant amount of 56Ni, ranging from 0.1 Msun
to 1.1 Msun, compatible not only with normal-Branch type Ia supernova but also
with the subluminous and super-Chandrasekhar subset. Nevertheless, the
distribution mass-function of white dwarfs favors collisions among 0.6-0.7 Msun
objects, leading to subluminous events.

multiple local optima, and an explicit expression for the gradient of the
likelihood function is typically unavailable. Previous methods for optimizing
the likelihood function (e.g. MacDonald et al. (2013)) have proven to be robust

source at the input of an otherwise lossless infinite transmission line. The
solution of the paradox lies in the realization that in an open-circuit finite
transmission line/ladder network, there is an incident as well as a reflected
wave and the input impedence is determined by the superposition of both waves.
It is explicitly shown that the reactive input impedance of even a single
block, comprising say a simple LC circuit, is determined at all driving
frequencies from the superposition of incident and reflected waves, and that
the input impedance remains reactive in nature (i.e., an imaginary value) even
when additional blocks are added indefinitely. However in a ladder network or
transmission line, taken to be {\em infinite right from the beginning}, there
is no reflected wave (assuming the circuit to be ideal with no discontinuities
en route). Thus the source while continuously supplying power in the forward
direction, does not retrieve it from a reflected wave and unlike in the case of
a finite line, there is a net power loss. This apparently lost energy
ultimately appears in the electromagnetic fields in the reactive elements
(capacitances and inductances which to begin with had no such stored energy),
further down the line as the incident wave advances forward. It is also shown
that radiation plays absolutely no role in resolving this intriguing paradox.

distance methods into Bayesian analysis. We propose to modify a prior over
non-parametric densities with the exponential of twice the Hellinger distance
between a candidate and a parametric density. By incorporating a prior over the
parameters of the second density, we arrive at a hierarchical model in which a
non-parametric model is placed between parameters and the data. The parameters
of the family can then be estimated as hyperparameters in the model. In
frequentist estimation, minimizing the Hellinger distance between a kernel
density estimate and a parametric family has been shown to produce estimators
that are both robust to outliers and statistically efficient when the
parametric model is correct. In this paper, we demonstrate that the same
results are applicable when a non-parametric Bayes density estimate replaces
the kernel density estimate. We then demonstrate that robustness and efficiency
also hold for the proposed hierarchical model. The finite-sample behavior of
the resulting estimates is investigated by simulation and on real world data.

collaborative filtering approach to develop a course recommendation system. The
proposed approach provides student an accurate prediction of the grade they may
get if they choose a particular course, which will be helpful when they decide
on selecting elective courses, as grade is an important parameter for a student

collaborative filtering approach on a real life data set and show that the

accretion disks threaded with weak vertical magnetic fields. We perform the
simulations in the spherical coordinates with different temperature profiles
and accordingly different rotation profiles. In the cases with a spatially
constant temperature, because the rotation frequency is vertically constant in
the equilibrium condition, general properties of the turbulence are
quantitatively similar to those obtained in local shearing box simulations. On
the other hand, in the cases with a radially variable temperature profile, the
vertical differential rotation, which is inevitable in the equilibrium
condition, winds up the magnetic field lines, in addition to the usual radial
differential rotation. As a result, the coherent wound magnetic fields
contribute to the Maxwell stress in the surface regions. We obtain
nondimensional density and velocity fluctuations ~0.1-0.2 at the midplane. The
azimuthal power spectra of the magnetic fields show shallow slopes, ~m^0-
m^{-1}, than those of velocity and density. We observe intermittent and
structured disk winds driven by the Poynting flux associated with the MHD
turbulence. The Poynting flux originating from magnetic tension is injected
from the regions above a scale height towards both the midplane and the
surfaces. Related to this, sound waves are directed to the midplane from the
surface regions. The mass accretion mainly occurs near the surfaces and the gas
near the midplane slowly moves outward, which causes large-scale meridional
circulations. The vertical magnetic fields are also dragged inward in the
surface regions, while they stochastically move outward and inward around the
midplane. We also discuss an observational implication of induced spiral
structure in the simulated turbulent disks to protoplanetary disks.

enables us to handle large problems (with $\sim10^6$ species). We show using

generation sequencing enables us to detect variants occurring at low

hitherto not possible because next generation sequencing delivers relatively
short reads. We here provide a proof of principle that whole HIV-1 genomes can
be reliably reconstructed from short reads, and use this to study the selection
of immune escape mutations at the level of whole genome haplotypes. Using
realistically simulated HIV-1 populations, we demonstrate that reconstruction
of complete genome haplotypes is feasible with high fidelity. We do not
reconstruct all genetically distinct genomes, but each reconstructed haplotype
represents one or more of the quasispecies in the HIV-1 population. We then
reconstruct 30 whole genome haplotypes from published short sequence reads
sampled longitudinally from a single HIV-1 infected patient. We confirm the
reliability of the reconstruction by validating our predicted haplotype genes
with single genome amplification sequences, and by comparing haplotype
frequencies with observed epitope escape frequencies. Phylogenetic analysis
shows that the HIV-1 population undergoes selection driven evolution, with
successive replacement of the viral population by novel dominant strains. We
demonstrate that immune escape mutants evolve in a dependent manner with
various mutations hitchhiking along with others. As a consequence of this
clonal interference, selection coefficients have to be estimated for complete
haplotypes and not for individual immune escapes.

of Bragg peaks are visible in the scattering data and these are found to be
consistent with a lattice spacing $a(=b)=5.69(1)$\AA\ with a dihedral angle
along the (helical) chain of 166$^\circ$ which gives a repeat distance along
the chain (c-axis) of $\sim$19.6\AA. The positions of the Bragg peaks are well
reproduced by this model, although there is a mismatch in the amplitudes of
some of the higher order reflections between simulation and data. For PCTFE
there is only one visible Bragg peak (100) which is well reproduced by a
hexagonal lattice of atactic parallel polymers with a spacing of
$a(=b)=6.37(1)$\AA. In this case the absence of distinct reflections along the

but a model with nearly straight \textit{trans} (zig-zag) structure gives best
agreement with the data. For PCTFE little change in structure could be
discerned when the material was heated to 550K, apart from a slight increase in
lattice spacing. In both cases there is substantial diffuse scattering between
the Bragg peaks, and this is correctly replicated by the EPSR simulations.

logic formula compositionally on a composition of processes. It consists in
incrementally incorporating into the formula the behavioural information taken
from one process - an operation called quotienting - to obtain a new formula
that can be verified on a smaller composition from which the incorporated
process has been removed. Simplifications of the formula must be applied at
each step, so as to maintain the formula at a tractable size. In this paper, we
revisit partial model checking. First, we extend quotienting to the network of
labelled transition systems model, which subsumes most parallel composition
operators, including m-among-n synchronisation and parallel composition using
synchronisation interfaces, available in the ELOTOS standard. Second, we
reformulate quotienting in terms of a simple synchronous product between a
graph representation of the formula (called formula graph) and a process, thus
enabling quotienting to be implemented efficiently and easily, by reusing
existing tools dedicated to graph compositions. Third, we propose
simplifications of the formula as a combination of bisimulations and reductions
using Boolean equation systems applied directly to the formula graph, thus
enabling formula simplifications also to be implemented efficiently. Finally,
we describe an implementation in the CADP (Construction and Analysis of
Distributed Processes) toolbox and present some experimental results in which
partial model checking uses hundreds of times less memory than on-the-fly model
checking.

around the world. Biometric methods are found to be more effective and much
easier for the users than the traditional identification methods like keys,
smart cards and passwords. Unlike with the traditional methods, with biometric
methods the data acquisition is most of the times passive, which means the
users do not take active part in data acquisition. Data acquisition can be
performed using cameras, scanners or sensors. Human physiological biometrics
such as face, eye and ear are good candidates for uniquely identifying an
individual. However, human ear scores over face and eye because of certain
advantages it has over face. The most challenging phase in human identification
based on ear biometric is the segmentation of the ear image from the captured
image which may contain many unwanted details. In this work, PDE based image
processing techniques are used to segment out the ear image. Level Set Theory
based image processing is employed to obtain the contour of the ear image. A
few Level set algorithms are compared for their efficiency in segmenting test
ear images.

modulation technique which is very much popular in new wireless networks of
IEEE standard, digital television, audio broadcasting and 4G mobile
communications. The main benefit of OFDM over single-carrier schemes is its
ability to cope with severe channel conditions without complex equalization
filters. It has improved the quality of long-distance communication by
eliminating InterSymbol Interference (ISI) and improving Signal-to-Noise ratio
(SNR). The main drawbacks of OFDM are its high peak to average power ratio and
its sensitivity to phase noise and frequency offset. This paper gives an
overview of OFDM, its applications in various systems such as IEEE 802.11a,
Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) and Digital Broadcast Services to Handheld
Devices (DVB-H) along with its advantages and disadvantages.

integrated into daily life. In this paper, we develop a framework to predict
mobile Apps that are most likely to be used regarding the current device status
of a smartphone. Such an Apps usage prediction framework is a crucial
prerequisite for fast App launching, intelligent user experience, and power
management of smartphones. By analyzing real App usage log data, we discover
two kinds of features: The Explicit Feature (EF) from sensing readings of
built-in sensors, and the Implicit Feature (IF) from App usage relations. The
IF feature is derived by constructing the proposed App Usage Graph (abbreviated
as AUG) that models App usage transitions. In light of AUG, we are able to
discover usage relations among Apps. Since users may have different usage
behaviors on their smartphones, we further propose one personalized feature
selection algorithm. We explore minimum description length (MDL) from the
training data and select those features which need less length to describe the
training data. The personalized feature selection can successfully reduce the
log size and the prediction time. Finally, we adopt the kNN classification
model to predict Apps usage. Note that through the features selected by the
proposed personalized feature selection algorithm, we only need to keep these
features, which in turn reduces the prediction time and avoids the curse of
dimensionality when using the kNN classifier. We conduct a comprehensive
experimental study based on a real mobile App usage dataset. The results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and show the predictive
capability for App usage prediction.

such as image and audio and to make hidden message imperceptible, a novel
method for steganography is introduced in this paper. It is based on Least
Significant Bit (LSB) manipulation and inclusion of redundant noise as secret
key in the message. This method is applied to data hiding in images. For data
hiding in audio, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Discrete Wavelet Transform
(DWT) both are used. All the results displayed prove to be time-efficient and
effective. Also the algorithm is tested for various numbers of bits. For those
values of bits, Mean Square Error (MSE) and Peak-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (PSNR)
are calculated and plotted. Experimental results show that the stego-image is
visually indistinguishable from the original cover-image when n<=4, because of
better PSNR which is achieved by this technique. The final results obtained
after steganography process does not reveal presence of any hidden message,
thus qualifying the criteria of imperceptible message.

several Earth flybys of spacecraft. Known physical effects could be excluded as
source of this anomaly. In order to model a possible new physical effect,
empirical equations were proposed by Busack (2007) and Anderson et al. (2007),
which gave quite good description of all measured anomalies. Some theories were
suggested deriving the Anderson formula or a similar one. The recent two Earth
flybys of the spacecraft Rosetta showed no measurable anomaly, although the
Anderson formula predicted distinct effects for both flybys. The Busack formula
predicted the null results, so the notion of a possibly correct formula or of
an error of the older measuring software was supported. The forthcoming Earth
flyby of Juno gives a good opportunity to decide this question or give rise to
enhanced theory, because the orbit parameters are very similar to earlier
flybys with notable effects. In this article, the flyby anomaly according to
the Busack equation will be predicted to be about -7mm/s in contrast to the
value after the Anderson equation and similar ones with distinct positive value
of the order of +6mm/s.

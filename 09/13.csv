that cannot be derived from a potential. For interacting cold Bose atoms we
report on the formation of a localised Hartree ground state for three prototype
waveguide geometries with broken translational symmetry: a cranked L-shaped
waveguide L, a T-shaped waveguide T, and the crossing C of two quantum
waveguides. The phenomenon is kinetic energy driven and cannot be described
within the Thomas-Fermi approximation. Depending on the ratio of joining
lateral tube diameters of the respective waveguides C,L,T delocalisation
commences when the particle number N approaches a critical value. For the case
of a binary mixture of two different Bose atom species A and B we observe non
standard trapping of both atom species for subcritical particle numbers. A
sudden demixing quantum transition takes place as the total particle number
N=N_{A}+N_{B} is increased at fixed mixing ratio N_{A}/N_{B}. Depending on the
mass ratio m_{A}/m_{B} the heavier atom species delocalises first for a wide
range of interaction parameters. The numerical calculations are based on a
splitting scheme involving an analytic approximation to the short time
asymptotics of the imaginary time quantum propagator of a single particle

radio quasars (FSRQs) with quasi-simultaneous spectral energy distributions
(SEDs), in which the SEDs of 21 FSRQs are reproduced by the one-zone leptonic
model including the synchrotron-self Compton (SSC) and external Compton (EC)
processes. We suggest that the X-ray emission could be produced by the SSC
process and the GeV emission could come from the EC process. The EC emission
could originate from the inverse Compton (IC) scattering of photons from the
broad line region (BLR) and accretion disk or dust torus by the same electron
population, which mainly depend on the location of the $\gamma$-ray emission
region. We propose a method to constrain the location of the GeV emission
region based on the spectral shapes. When the GeV emission is located within
the BLR, the IC scattering could occur at the Klein-Nishina regime and produce
a broken/steep spectrum in the GeV energy band. When the GeV emission is
produced outside the BLR, the IC scattering could take place at the Thomson
regime and the GeV spectrum would have the same spectral index as the
optical-infrared spectrum. We infer that the location of the GeV emission
region is inside the BLR for 5 FSRQs and beyond the BLR for 16 FSRQs. Our
results show that the ratio of the magnetic field and electron energy density
is close to equipartition condition for 21 FSRQs.

presented. It is argued that the trajectories obeying them also satisfy the
Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac (ALD) equations for general 3D motions in the
non-relativistic and relativistic limits. The case of forces only depending of
the proper time is here considered. For these properties to hold, it is
sufficient that the external force to be infinitely smooth and that a series
formed with its time derivatives converges. This series define in a special
local way the effective forces entering the Newton equations. When the external
force vanishes in an open vicinity of a given time, the effective one also
becomes null. Thus, the proper solutions of the effective equations can not
show runaway or pre-acceleration effects. The Newton equations are numerically
solved for a pulsed force given by an analytic function along the proper time
axis. The simultaneous satisfaction of the ALD equations is numerically
checked. Further, a set of modified ALD equations for almost everywhere
infinitely smooth forces, but including step like discontinuities in some
points is also presented for the case of collinear motions. The form of the
equations supports the statement argued in a previous work, about that the
causal Lienard-Wiechert field solution surrounding a radiating particle,
implies that the effective force on the particle should instantaneously vanish
when the external force is retired. The modified ALD equations proposed in the
previous work are here derived in a generalized way including the same effect
also when a the force is instantly connected.

extend the conventional methodology of cosmography employing Taylor expansions
of observables by an alternative approach using Pad\'e approximations. Due to
the superior convergence properties of Pad\'e expansions, it is possible to
improve the fitting analysis to obtain numerical values for the parameters of
the cosmographic series. From the results, we can derive the equation of state
parameter of the universe and its first derivative and thus acquire information
about the thermodynamic state of the universe. We carry out statistical
analyses using observations of the distance modulus of type 1a supernovae,
provided by the union 2.1 compilation of the supernova cosmology project,
employing a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach with an implemented Metropolis
algorithm. We compare the results of the original Taylor approach to the newly
introduced Pad\'e formalism. The analyses show that experimental data constrain
the observable universe well, finding an accelerating universe and a positive
jerk parameter. We demonstrate that the Pad\'e convergence radii are greater
than standard Taylor convergence radii, and infer a lower limit on the
acceleration of the universe solely by requiring the positivity of the Pad\'e
expansion. We obtain fairly good agreement with the Planck results, confirming
the $\Lambda$CDM model at small redshifts, although we cannot exclude a dark
energy density varying in time with negligible speed of sound.

improving the convergence of a Gibbs sampler. PCG achieves faster convergence

Although this can significantly improve convergence, care must be taken to
ensure that the stationary distribution is preserved. The conditional
distributions sampled in a PCG sampler may be incompatible and permuting their
order may upset the stationary distribution of the chain. Extra care must be
taken when Metropolis-Hastings (MH) updates are used in some or all of the
updates. Reducing the conditioning in an MH within Gibbs sampler can change the
stationary distribution, even when the PCG sampler would work perfectly if MH
were not used. In fact, a number of samplers of this sort that have been
advocated in the literature do not actually have the target stationary
distributions. In this article, we illustrate the challenges that may arise
when using MH within a PCG sampler and develop a general strategy for using
such updates while maintaining the desired stationary distribution. Theoretical
arguments provide guidance when choosing between different MH within PCG

states, slow relaxation timescales and associated structural changes, and
stationary or kinetic experimental observables of complex molecules from large
amounts of molecular dynamics simulation data. However, MSMs approximate the
true dynamics by assuming a Markov chain on a clusters discretization of the
state space. This approximation is difficult to make for high-dimensional
biomolecular systems, and the quality and reproducibility of MSMs has therefore
been limited. Here, we discard the assumption that dynamics are Markovian on
the discrete clusters. Instead, we only assume that the full phase- space
molecular dynamics is Markovian, and a projection of this full dynamics is
observed on the discrete states, leading to the concept of Projected Markov
Models (PMMs). Robust estimation methods for PMMs are not yet available, but we
derive a practically feasible approximation via Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). It
is shown how various molecular observables of interest that are often computed
from MSMs can be computed from HMMs / PMMs. The new framework is applicable to
both, simulation and single-molecule experimental data. We demonstrate its
versatility by applications to educative model systems, an 1 ms Anton MD
simulation of the BPTI protein, and an optical tweezer force probe trajectory

periodicities between 4-5 hours and 35-45 days. We find evidence for the
distribution of individual transient coherency scales consisting of two
distinct populations. Below the $\sim$2 day time scale the distribution is
reasonably approximated by an inverse power law, whereas for scales $\gtrsim$2
days, the distribution levels off showing discrete peaks at common coherency
scales. In addition, by organizing the transient coherency scale distributions
by wind type, we find these larger, common coherency scales are more prevalent
and well-defined in coronal hole wind. Finally, we discuss the implications of
our results for current theories of solar wind generation and describe future
work for determining the relationship between the coherent structures in our
ionic composition data and the structure of the coronal magnetic field.

dispersive magnetic excitation in the frustrated triangular-lattice spin-2
chain oxide Ca3Co2O6. At the lowest temperature (T = 1.5 K), this magnon is
characterized by a large zone-center spin gap of ~27 meV, which we attribute to
the large single-ion anisotropy, and disperses along the chain direction with a
bandwidth of ~3.5 meV. In the directions orthogonal to the chains, no
measurable dispersion was found. With increasing temperature, the magnon
dispersion shifts towards lower energies, yet persists up to at least 150 K,
indicating that the ferromagnetic intrachain correlations survive up to 6 times
higher temperatures than the long-range interchain antiferromagnetic order. The
magnon dispersion can be well described within the predictions of linear
spin-wave theory for a system of weakly coupled ferromagnetic chains with large
single-ion anisotropy, enabling the direct quantitative determination of the
magnetic exchange and anisotropy parameters.

some 1\leq \ell\leq k-1, V can be {\em partitioned} into l sets P_1,\ldots,P_l

induced subgraph. In particular, \phi(P_i)=O(l^3\sqrt{\lambda_l}) and
\phi(G[P_i]) >= \lambda_k/k^2).
  We make our results algorithmic by designing a simple polynomial time
spectral algorithm to find such partitioning of G with a quadratic loss in the
inside conductance of P_i's. Unlike the recent results on higher order
Cheeger's inequality [LOT12,LRTV12], our algorithmic results do not use higher
order eigenfunctions of G. If there is a sufficiently large gap between
lambda_k and lambda_{k+1}, more precisely, if \lambda_{k+1} >= \poly(k)

P_1,...,P_k such that the induced subgraph G[P_i] has a significantly larger
conductance than the conductance of P_i in G. Such a partitioning may represent
the best k clustering of G. Our algorithm is a simple local search that only
uses the Spectral Partitioning algorithm as a subroutine. We expect to see
further applications of this simple algorithm in clustering applications.

Water has a low wettability on bare and butanol-covered graphite resulting in
the growth of rough ice surfaces. In contrast, pre-adsorbed methanol provides
hydrophilic surface sites and results in the formation of smooth crystalline
ice; an effect that is pronounced also for sub-monolayer methanol coverages.
The alcohols primarily reside at the ice surface and at the ice-graphite

their motion, and a computationally enhanced implementation of the
""shift-and-add"" data processing technique that helps to improve the signal to
noise ratio (SNR) for detection of NEA's. The SNR of a single short exposure of
a dim NEA is insufficient to detect it in one frame, but by computationally
searching for an appropriate velocity vector, shifting successive frames
relative to each other and then co-adding the shifted frames in
post-processing, we synthetically create a long-exposure image as if the
telescope were tracking the object. This approach, which we call ""synthetic

a wide blind search, detect, and track dim and fast-moving NEA's in near real

10-fold improvement of astrometric precision over the traditional long exposure

extension for three-dimensional ABJM theory was proposed. Here we establish a
direct connection between planar scattering amplitudes of ABJM theory, and
singularities there of, to the stratification of the positive orthogonal
grassmannian. In particular, scattering processes are constructed through
on-shell diagrams, which are simply iterative gluing of the fundamental
four-point amplitude. Each diagram is then equivalent to the merging of
fundamental OG_2 orthogonal grassmannian to form a larger OG_k, where 2k is the
number of external particles. The invariant information that is encoded in each
diagram is precisely this stratification. This information can be easily read
off via permutation paths of the on-shell diagram, which also can be used to
derive a canonical representation of OG_k that manifests the vanishing of
consecutive minors as the singularity of all on-shell diagrams. Quite
remarkably, for the BCFW recursion representation of the tree-level amplitudes,
the on-shell diagram manifests the presence of all physical factorization
poles, as well as the cancellation of the spurious poles. After analytically
continuing the orthogonal grassmannian to split signature, we reveal that each
on-shell diagram in fact resides in the positive cell of the orthogonal
grassmannian, where all minors are positive. In this language, the amplitudes
of ABJM theory is simply an integral of a product of dlog forms, over the
positive orthogonal grassmannian.

accounts for the limited sample size of the reference panel, a crucial step to
eliminate false-positive associations, and is computationally very fast. As an
empirical demonstration, we apply our method to 7 case-control phenotypes from
the WTCCC data and a study of height in the British 1958 birth cohort (1958BC).
Gaussian imputation from summary statistics recovers 95% (105%) of the
effective sample size (as quantified by the ratio of $\chi^2$ association
statistics) compared to HMM-based imputation from individual-level genotypes at
the 227 (176) published SNPs in the WTCCC (1958BC height) data. In addition,
for publicly available summary statistics from large meta-analyses of 4 lipid
traits, we publicly release imputed summary statistics at 1000G SNPs, which
could not have been obtained using previously published methods, and
demonstrate their accuracy by masking subsets of the data. We show that 1000G
imputation using our approach increases the magnitude and statistical evidence
of enrichment at genic vs. non-genic loci for these traits, as compared to an
analysis without 1000G imputation. Thus, imputation of summary statistics will

to adjust the power at which it makes its transmissions and choose the set of
neighbors with which it communicates directly, while preserving global goals
such as connectivity or coverage. This allows each node to conserve energy and
contribute to increasing the lifetime of the network. In this paper, in
contrast to most previous work, we consider (i) both the energy costs of
communication as well as the amount of available energy at each node, (ii) the
realistic situation of varying rates of energy consumption at different nodes,
and (iii) the fact that co-operation between nodes, where some nodes make a
sacrifice by increasing energy consumption to help other nodes reduce their
consumption, can be used to extend network lifetime. This paper introduces a
new distributed topology control algorithm, called the Cooperative Topology
Control with Adaptation (CTCA), based on a game-theoretic approach that maps
the problem of maximizing the network's lifetime into an ordinal potential
game. We prove the existence of a Nash equilibrium for the game. Our simulation
results indicate that the CTCA algorithm extends the life of a network by more
than 50% compared to the best previously-known algorithm. We also study the

accelerated observer moving in a thermal bath. In particular, we obtain an
exact closed expression of the reduced density matrix for an uniformly
accelerated observer with acceleration $a = 2\pi T$ when the state of the
quantum field is a thermal bath at temperature $T^\prime$. We find that the
density matrix has a simple form with an effective partition function $Z$ being
a product, $Z = Z_T Z_{T^\prime}$, of two thermal partition functions
corresponding to temperatures $T$ and $T^\prime$ and hence is not thermal, even
when $T = T^\prime$. We show that, even though the partition function has a
product structure, the two thermal baths are, in fact, interacting systems;
although in the high frequency limit $\omega_k \gg T$ and $\omega_k \gg
T^\prime$, the interactions are found to become sub-dominant. We further
demonstrate that the resulting spectrum of the Rindler particles can be
interpreted in terms of spontaneous and stimulated emission due to the
background thermal bath. The density matrix is also found to be symmetric in
the acceleration temperature $T$ and the thermal bath temperature $T^\prime$
indicating that thermodynamic experiments alone cannot distinguish between the
thermal effects due to $T$ and those due to $T^\prime$. The entanglement
entropy associated with the reduced density matrix (with the background
contribution of the Davies-Unruh bath removed) is shown to satisfy, in the
$\omega_k \gg T^\prime$ limit, a first law of thermodynamics relation of the
form $T \delta S = \delta E$ where $\delta E$ is the difference in the energies

to derive effective low-energy scattering vertices of interacting many-body
systems. Starting from a non-interacting expansion point of the action, the
flow of the RG parameter Lambda allows to trace the evolution of the effective
one-particle and two-particle vertices towards low energies by taking into
account the vertex corrections between all parquet channels in an unbiased
fashion. In this work, we generalize the expansion point at which the
diagrammatic resummation procedure is initiated from a free UV limit to a
cluster product state. We formulate a cluster FRG scheme where the
non-interacting building blocks (i.e., decoupled spin clusters) are treated
exactly, and the inter-cluster couplings are addressed via RG. As a benchmark
study, we apply our cluster FRG scheme to the spin-1/2 bilayer Heisenberg model
(BHM) on a square lattice where the neighboring sites in the two layers form
the individual 2-site clusters. Comparing with existing numerical evidence for
the BHM, we obtain reasonable findings for the spin susceptibility, magnon
dispersion, and magnon quasiparticle weight even in coupling regimes close to
antiferromagnetic order. The concept of cluster FRG promises applications to a
large class of interacting electron systems.

rigorously prove the simplified formula of the joint likelihood and show that

demonstrative toy model of fitting a straight line to two sets of data. We show
that the hyperparameter matrix method can detect unaccounted systematic errors

factors provides a distinct indicator of the necessity of including
hyperparameters. Our example shows that the likelihood we construct for joint

binaries, pairs of stars separated by over ~1000 AU. Due to perturbations from
other passing stars and the Milky Way's tide, the orbits of very wide binary
stars occasionally become extremely eccentric, which forces close encounters
between the companion stars (Kaib et al. 2013). We show that this process
causes a stellar collision between very wide binary companion stars once every
1000-7500 years on average in the Milky Way. One of the main uncertainties in
this collision rate is the amount of energy dissipated by dynamic tides during
close (but not collisional) periastron passages. This dissipation presents a
dynamical barrier to stellar collisions and can instead transform very wide
binaries into close or contact binaries. However, for any plausible tidal
dissipation model, very wide binary stars are an unrealized, and potentially
the dominant, source of stellar collisions in our Galaxy. Such collisions
should occur throughout the thin disk of the Milky Way. Stellar collisions
within very wide binaries should yield a small population of single,
Li-depleted, rapidly rotating massive stars.

X-ray FS flux. 2. For the optical sample, we use the condition that the
observed flux arises from the FS (optical sample light curves decline as ~t^-1,
as expected for the FS). Making a reasonable assumption on E (jet isotropic
equivalent kinetic energy), we converted these conditions into an upper limit
(measurement) on epsilon_B n^{2/(p+1)} for our X-ray (optical) sample, where n
is the circumburst density and p is the electron index. Taking n=1 cm^-3, the

compression of a seed magnetic field ~10 muG, we expressed our results in terms
of an amplification factor, AF, which is very weakly dependent on n (AF propto

number conservation and locality, in systems with sufficient damping. In this
paper we consider diffusive processes in the bulk of Weyl semimetals, which are
exotic quantum materials, recently of considerable interest. In order to do
this, we first explicitly implement the analytical scheme by which disorder
with anisotropic scattering amplitude is incorporated into the diagrammatic
response-function formalism for calculating the `diffuson'. The result thus
obtained is consistent with transport coefficients evaluated from the Boltzmann
transport equation or the renormalized uniform current vertex calculation, as
it should be. We thus demonstrate that the computation of the diffusion
coefficient should involve the transport lifetime, and not the quasiparticle
lifetime. Using this method, we then calculate the density response function in
Weyl semimetals and discover an unconventional diffusion process that is
significantly slower than conventional diffusion. This gives rise to relaxation
processes that exhibit stretched exponential decay, instead of the usual
exponential diffusive relaxation. This result is then explained using a model
of thermally excited quasiparticles diffusing with diffusion coefficients which
are strongly dependent on their energies. We elucidate the roles of the various
energy and time scales involved in this novel process and propose an experiment
by which this process may be observed.

model, apart from the standard General Relativistic junction conditions, two
extra conditions, namely the continuity of the curvature scalar and its first
derivative needs to be satisfied. For an exterior Schwarzschild solution, the
curvature scalar and its derivative has to be zero at the stellar surface. We
show that for some equation of state (EoS) of matter, matching all conditions
at the surface of the star is impossible. Hence the model brings two major
fine-tuning problems: (i) only some particular classes of EoS are consistent
with Schwarzschild at the surface and (ii) given that EoS, only a very
particular set of boundary conditions at the centre of the star will satisfy
the given boundary conditions at the surface. Hence we show that this model

highly unnatural, for the existence of compact astrophysical objects. This is
because the EoS of a compact star should be completely determined by the
physics of nuclear matter at high density and not the theory of gravity.

identified as a likely high-redshift blazar candidate in the SDSS+FIRST quasar
catalog. Here we use the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) to
investigate its non-thermal jet emission, whose high-energy component we
detected in the hard X-ray energy band. The X-ray flux is ~5.5x10^(-14) erg
cm^(-2)s^(-1) (5-10keV) and the photon spectral index is Gamma_X=1.3-1.6.
Modeling the full spectral energy distribution, we find that the jet is
oriented close to the line of sight, with a viewing angle of ~3deg, and has
significant Doppler boosting, with a large bulk Lorentz factor ~13, which
confirms the identification of B2 1023+25 as a blazar. B2 1023+25 is the first
object at redshift larger than 5 detected by NuSTAR, demonstrating the ability
of NuSTAR to investigate the early X-ray Universe and to study extremely active

lensed galaxies are combined with reference samples of sub-millimeter and
normal z~1-2 star-forming galaxies with similar far-infrared photometry to
study the gas and dust properties of galaxies in the SFR-M*-redshift parameter
space. The mean gas depletion timescale of main sequence galaxies at z>2 is
measured to be only ~450Myr, a factor of ~1.5 (~5) shorter than at z=1 (z=0),
in agreement with a (1+z)^-1 scaling. The mean gas mass fraction at z=2.8 is
40+/-15% (44% after incompleteness correction), suggesting a flattening or even
a reversal of the trend of increasing gas fractions with redshift recently
observed up to z~2. The depletion timescale and gas fractions of the z>2 normal
star-forming galaxies can be explained under the ""equilibrium model"" for galaxy
evolution, in which the gas reservoir of galaxies is the primary driver of the
redshift evolution of specific star formation rates. Due to their high star
formation efficiencies and low metallicities, the z>2 lensed galaxies have warm
dust despite being located on the star formation main sequence. At fixed
metallicity, they also have a gas-to-dust ratio 1.7 times larger than observed
locally when using the same standard techniques, suggesting that applying the
local calibration of the relation between gas-to-dust ratio and metallicity to
infer the molecular gas mass of high redshift galaxies may lead to systematic
differences with CO-based estimates.

parameters that determine the growth of structure (\sigma_8 and \Omega_M) and
scales as \sigma_8^7.4 and \Omega_M^1.9 around the multipole (ell) ~ 1000. We
constrain \sigma_8 and \Omega_M from the cross-power spectrum to be \sigma_8
(\Omega_M/0.30)^0.26 = 0.8 +/- 0.02. Since this cross spectrum produces a tight
constraint in the \sigma_8 and \Omega_M plane the errors on a \sigma_8
constraint will be mostly limited by the uncertainties from external
constraints. Future cluster catalogs, like those from eRosita and LSST, and
pointed multi-wavelength observations of clusters will improve the constraining
power of this cross spectrum measurement. In principle this analysis can be
extended beyond \sigma_8 and \Omega_M to constrain dark energy or the sum of

occurrence distribution at the shortest period. We call planets that Kepler
will be able to find as ""big"", for the purpose of comparing the distribution of

planets from one field has been interpreted to show that the shortest period
giant planets are at the end of an ongoing flow of high eccentricity migration,
likely from scattering from further out. The numbers of planets at these short
periods is still small, leaving uncertainty over the result that the
distribution shows the expected power index for inward tidal migration. The
current statistics make it hard to say whether the presence of more giant
planets at the shortest periods despite there being more medium planets at most
periods indicates a greater migration of giant than medium planets. We propose
a repurposed Kepler mission to make enough 45-day observations to survey 10
times as many stars as in the survey of the original field, to survey for
planets with periods of up to fifteen days with at least three transits. The

potentially rapid depletion of the battery reserves due to either their central
location or just the traffic patterns generated by the application. Traditional
energy management strategies, such as those which use topology control
algorithms, reduce the energy consumed at each node to the minimum necessary.
In this paper, we use a different approach that balances the energy consumption
at each of the nodes, thus increasing the functional lifetime of the network.
We propose a new distributed dynamic topology control algorithm called Energy
Balanced Topology Control (EBTC) which considers the actual energy consumed for
each transmission and reception to achieve the goal of an increased functional
lifetime. We analyze the algorithm's computational and communication complexity
and show that it is equivalent or lower in complexity to other dynamic topology
control algorithms. Using an empirical model of energy consumption, we show
that the EBTC algorithm increases the lifetime of a wireless sensor network by
over 40% compared to the best of previously known algorithms.

systems such as \alpha Cen or \gamma Cep provide an important test of planet
formation theories. Gravitational perturbations from the companion are expected
to excite high planetesimal eccentricities resulting in destruction, rather
than growth, of objects with sizes of up to several hundred km in collisions of
similar-size bodies. It was recently suggested that gravity of a massive
axisymmetric gaseous disk in which planetesimals are embedded drives rapid
precession of their orbits, suppressing eccentricity excitation. However, disks
in binaries are themselves expected to be eccentric, leading to additional
planetesimal excitation. Here we develop secular theory of eccentricity
evolution for planetesimals perturbed by the gravity of an elliptical
protoplanetary disk (neglecting gas drag) and the companion. For the first time
we derive an expression for the disturbing function due to an eccentric disk,
which can be used for a variety of other astrophysical problems. We obtain
explicit analytical solutions for planetesimal eccentricity evolution and
delineate four different regimes of dynamical excitation. We show that in
systems with massive (>10^{-2}M_Sun) disks, planetesimal eccentricity is
usually determined by the gravity of the eccentric disk alone, and is
comparable to the disk eccentricity. As a result, the latter imposes a lower
limit on collisional velocities of solids, making their growth problematic.
This fragmentation barrier can be removed if the gaseous disk rapidly precesses
or if its own self-gravity is efficient at lowering disk eccentricity.

properties of complicated wave scattering systems in the semiclassical limit,
while the random coupling model offers a complete statistical model with a
simple additive formula in terms of impedance to combine the predictions of RMT
and nonuniversal system-specific features. The statistics of measured wave
properties generally have nonuniversal features. However, ratios of the
variances of elements of the impedance matrix are predicted to be independent
of such nonuniversal features and thus should be universal functions of the
overall system loss. In contrast with impedance variance ratios, scattering
variance ratios depends on nonuniversal features unless the system is in the
high loss regime. In this paper, we present numerical tests of the predicted
universal impedance variance ratios and show that an insufficient sample size
can lead to apparent deviation from the theory, particularly in the low loss
regime. Experimental tests are carried out in three two-port microwave cavities
with varied loss parameters, including a novel experimental system with a
superconducting microwave billiard, to test the variance-ratio predictions in
the low loss time-reversal-invariant regime. It is found that the experimental
results agree with the theoretical predictions to the extent permitted by the
finite sample size.

the rationale of applying emerging spin-torque devices for bio-inspired

low-voltage and high-speed magnetization switching in nano-scale magnetic
devices. Such magneto-metallic, current-mode spin-torque switches can mimic the
analog summing and thresholding operation of an artificial neuron with high
energy-efficiency. Comparison with CMOS-based analog circuit-model of neuron

magnetic-coupling and electrical-coupling are analyzed. Magnetic coupling is
simulated using dipolar-field interactions. For electricalcoupling we employed
global RF-injection. In this method, multiple STOs are phase-locked to a common
RF-signal that is injected into the STOs along with the DC bias. Results for
variation and noise analysis indicate that electrical-coupling can be
significantly more robust as compared to magnetic-coupling. For
room-temperature simulations, appreciable phase-lock was retained among tens of
electrically coupled STOs for up to 20% 3s random variations in critical device
parameters. The magnetic-coupling technique however failed to retain locking
beyond ~3% 3s parameter-variations, even for small-size STO clusters with
near-neighborhood connectivity. We propose and analyze Dual-Pillar STO (DP-STO)

observed that DP-STO can better exploit the electrical-coupling technique due

value of the electric polarization, evaluated at the atomic sites, can be cast
in terms of a summation over nearest-neighbor distances and Born effective
charges. Within this model, the local polarization shows a direct relation to
internal strain and can be expressed in terms of internal strain parameters.
The predictions of the present theory show excellent agreement with a formal
Berry phase calculation for random distortions of a test-case CuPt-like InGaN
alloy and InGaN supercells with randomly placed cations. While the present
level of theory is appropriate for highly ionic compounds, we show that a more
complex model is needed for less ionic materials, in which the strain
dependence of Born effective charges has to be taken into account. Moreover, we
provide ab initio parameters for GaN, InN and AlN, including hybrid functional
values for the piezoelectric coefficients and the spontaneous polarization,
which we use to accurately implement the local theory expressions. In order to
calculate the local polarization potential, we also present a point dipole
method. This method overcomes several limitations related to discretization and
resolution which arise when obtaining the local potential by solving Poisson's
equation on an atomic grid. Finally, we perform tight-binding supercell
calculations to assess the impact of the local polarization potential arising
from alloy fluctuations on the electronic properties of InGaN alloys. In
particular, we find that the large upward bowing with composition of the InGaN

subject since the very origins of peer-to-peer (p2p) computing. Today, the
corresponding optimization tradeoffs are fairly well-understood, at least in
the static case and from a worst-case perspective.
  This paper revisits the peer-to-peer topology design problem from a
self-organization perspective. We initiate the study of topologies which are
optimized to serve the communication demand, or even self-adjusting as demand
changes. The appeal of this new paradigm lies in the opportunity to be able to
go beyond the lower bounds and limitations imposed by a static,
communication-oblivious, topology. For example, the goal of having short
routing paths (in terms of hop count) does no longer conflict with the
requirement of having low peer degrees.
  We propose a simple overlay topology Obst(k) which is composed of k (rooted
and directed) Binary Search Trees (BSTs), where k is a parameter. We first
prove some fundamental bounds on what can and cannot be achieved optimizing a
topology towards a static communication pattern (a static Obst(k)). In
particular, we show that the number of BSTs that constitute the overlay can
have a large impact on the routing costs, and that a single additional BST may
reduce the amortized communication costs from Omega(log(n)) to O(1), where n is
the number of peers. Subsequently, we discuss a natural self-adjusting
extension of Obst(k), in which frequently communicating partners are ""splayed

not limited by the intrinsic properties of actual vortex devices, but by
wavefront control residuals and incoherent background (e.g. thermal emission of
the sky) or the light diffracted by the imprint of the secondary mirror and
support structures on the telescope pupil. In the particular case of unfriendly
apertures (mainly large central obscuration) when very high contrast is needed
(e.g. direct imaging of older exoplanets with extremely large telescopes or
space- based coronagraphs), a simple VC, as most coronagraphs, can not deliver
its nominal performance because of the contamination due to the diffraction

three compartments of the intestinal crypt: stem cells, semi-differentiated
cells and fully differentiated cells. Stem and semi-differentiated cells may
divide to self-renew, undergo programmed death or progress to
semi-differentiated and fully differentiated cells respectively. The
probabilities of each of these events provide the most important parameters of
the model. Fully differentiated cells do not divide, but a proportion undergoes
programmed death in each generation. Our previous models showed that failure of
programmed death - for example, in tumorigenesis - could lead either to
exponential growth in cell numbers or to growth to some plateau. Our new models
incorporate plausible fluctuation in the parameters of the model and introduce
non-linearity by assuming that the parameters depend on the numbers of cells in
each state of differentiation. We find that the model is characterized by
bifurcation between increase in cell numbers to stable equilibrium or
'explosive' exponential growth; in a restricted number of cases, there may be
multiple stable equilibria. Fluctuation in cell numbers undergoing programmed
death, for example caused by tissue damage, generally makes exponential growth
more likely, as long as the size of the fluctuation exceeds a certain critical
value for a sufficiently long period of time. In most cases, once exponential
growth has started, this process is irreversible. In some circumstances,
exponential growth is preceded by a long plateau phase, of variable duration,
mimicking equilibrium: thus apparently self-limiting lesions may not be so in
practice.

nonminimally coupled with a gravity theory given by a particular Lovelock
action indexed by an integer k. To be more precise, the coefficients appearing
in the Lovelock expansion are fixed by requiring the theory to have a unique
AdS vacuum with a fixed value of the cosmological constant. This yields to
k=1,2,...,[(D-1)/2] inequivalent possible gravity theories; here the case k=1
corresponds to the standard Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian. For each par (D,k), we
derive two classes of AdS black hole solutions with planar event horizon
topology for particular values of the nonminimal coupling parameter. The first
family of solutions depends on a unique constant and is valid only for k>1. In
fact, its GR counterpart k=1 reduces to the pure AdS metric with a vanishing
scalar field. The second family of solutions involves two independent constants
and corresponds to a stealth black hole configuration; that is a nontrivial
scalar field together with a black hole metric such that both side of the
Einstein equations (gravity and matter parts) vanishes identically. In this
case, the standard GR case k=1 reduces to the Schwarzschild-AdS-Tangherlini
black hole metric with a trivial scalar field. In both cases, the existence of
these solutions is strongly inherent of the presence of the higher order
curvature terms k>1 of the Lovelock gravity. We also establish that these
solutions emerge from a stealth configuration defined on the pure AdS metric
through a Kerr-Schild transformation. Finally, in the last part, we include
multiple exact (D-1)-forms homogenously distributed and coupled to the scalar
field. For a specific coupling, we obtain black hole solutions for arbitrary
value of the nonminimal coupling parameter generalizing those obtained in the

nozzle. The Euler-Poisson system for subsonic flow is a hyperbolic-elliptic
coupled nonlinear system. One of the crucial ingredient of this work is the
combination of Helmholtz decomposition for the velocity field and stream
function formulation together. In terms of the Helmholtz decomposition, the
Euler-Poisson system is rewritten as a second order nonlinear elliptic system
of three equations and transport equations for entropy and pseudo-Bernoulli's
invariant. The associated elliptic system in a Lipschitz domain with nonlinear
boundary conditions is solved with the help of the estimates developed in [2]
based on its nice structure. The transport equations are resolved via the flow
map induced by the stream function formulation. Furthermore, the delicate
estimates for the flow map give the uniqueness of the solutions.

essentially non-oscillatory (FD-WENO) schemes for solving the ideal
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations in 2D and 3D. The philosophy of this work
is to use efficient high-order WENO spatial discretizations with high-order
strong stability-preserving Runge-Kutta (SSP-RK) time-stepping schemes.
Numerical results have shown that with such methods we are able to resolve
solution structures that are only visible at much higher grid resolutions with
lower-order schemes. The key challenge in applying such methods to ideal MHD is
to control divergence errors in the magnetic field. We achieve this by
augmenting the base scheme with a novel high-order constrained transport
approach that updates the magnetic vector potential. The predicted magnetic
field from the base scheme is replaced by a divergence-free magnetic field that
is obtained from the curl of this magnetic potential. The non-conservative
weakly hyperbolic system that the magnetic vector potential satisfies is solved
using a version of FD-WENO developed for Hamilton-Jacobi equations. The
resulting numerical method is endowed with several important properties: (1)
all quantities, including all components of the magnetic field and magnetic
potential, are treated as point values on the same mesh (i.e., there is no mesh
staggering); (2) both the spatial and temporal orders of accuracy are
fourth-order; (3) no spatial integration or multidimensional reconstructions
are needed in any step; and (4) special limiters in the magnetic vector
potential update are used to control unphysical oscillations in the magnetic
field. Several 2D and 3D numerical examples are presented to verify the order
of accuracy on smooth test problems and to show high-resolution on test
problems that involve shocks.

sensitivity, where we have performed careful analysis. We applied the tool of
the LF statistics to three GRB classes predicted by the Fireshell model. One of
the main differences between the Fireshell and Fireball models is the
explanation of the GRB prompt emission, where the first claims that it is
divided in two physical processes: 1) transparency of a optically thick
Freshell producing the P-GRB emission and 2) interaction of a relativistic
shell (composed by baryons electron-positron-photon) against the CBM
(circumburst medium), producing the emission so-called extended afterglow peak
(EAP). However, the Fireball model, the most quoted one, claims that the prompt
emission is caused by interactions among several relativistic shells (composed
by electron-positron-photon) with different Lorentz factors, a process called
internal shocks. The transparency produces a strong short emission in the
beginning, called P-GRB. Thus, to the Fireshell model, the prompt emission is
P-GRB plus EAP. We produced, by LF statistics, predicted distributions of: peak
flux, redshift and peak luminosity for the three GRB classes predicted by
Fireshell model, we also used three GRB rates. We looked for differences among
the distributions, and in fact we found. We performed a comparison between the
distributions predicted and observed (with and without redshifts), where we had

  dielectrics","10 pages, 16 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We discuss a possibility to control a heat conductivity in simple
one-dimensional models of dielectrics by means of external mechanical loads. To
illustrate such possibilities we consider first a well-studied chain with
degenerate double-well potential of the interparticle interaction. Contrary to
previous studies, we consider varying length of the chain with fixed number of
particles. Number of possible energetically degenerate ground states strongly
depends on the overall length of the chain, or, in other terms, on average
length of the link between neighboring particles. These degenerate states
correspond to mechanical equilibrium, therefore one can say that the transition
between them mimics to some extent a process of plastic deformation. We
demonstrate that such modification of the chain length can lead to quite
profound (almost five-fold) reduction of the heat conduction coefficient. Even
more profound effect is revealed for a model with single-well non-convex
potential. It is demonstrated that in certain range of constant external
forcing this model becomes ""effectively""\ double-well, and has a multitude of
possible states of equilibrium for the same value of the external load. Thus,
the heat conduction coefficient can be reduced by two orders of magnitude. We
suggest a mechanical model of a chain with periodic double-well potential,
which allows control over the heat conduction. The models considered may be
useful for description of heat transport in biological macromolecules and for
control of the heat transport in microsystems.

companion separated by 55 AU was recently announced. In this work, we present
the first spectrum of the companion, ""kappa And B,"" using the Project 1640
high-contrast imaging platform. Comparison of our low-resolution YJH-band
spectra to empirical brown dwarf spectra suggests an early-L spectral type.
Fitting synthetic spectra from PHOENIX model atmospheres to our observed
spectrum allows us to constrain the effective temperature to ~2000K, as well as
place constraints on the companion surface gravity. Further, we use previously
reported log(g) and effective temperature measurements of the host star to
argue that the kappa And system has an isochronal age of 220 +/- 100 Myr, older
than the 30 Myr age reported previously. This interpretation of an older age is
corroborated by the photometric properties of kappa And B, which appear to be
marginally inconsistent with other 10-100 Myr low-gravity L-dwarfs for the
spectral type range we derive. In addition, we use Keck aperture masking
interferometry combined with published radial velocity measurements to rule out
the existence of any tight stellar companions to kappa And A that might be
responsible for the system's overluminosity. Further, we show that luminosity
enhancements due to a nearly ""pole-on"" viewing angle coupled with extremely
rapid rotation is unlikely. Kappa And A is thus consistent with its slightly
evolved luminosity class (IV) and we propose here that kappa And, with a
revised age of 220 +/- 100 Myr, is an interloper to the 30 Myr Columba
association with which it was previously associated. The photometric and
spectroscopic evidence for kappa And B combined with our re-assesment of the
system age implies a substellar companion mass of 50^{+16}_{-13} Jupiter

nearest-neighbor carbon-carbon distance $\rm a_{cc}$. Theoretical results are

an upper bound for the variance of the Monte Carlo estimator and propose a set
which is related to the kissing number problem in sphere packings. For the
inner radial integral, we employ the idea of antithetic variates and identify
certain conditions so that variance reduction is guaranteed. Extensive Monte
Carlo experiments on some probabilities calculation confirm these claims.

input-output observations is considered. The switched affine models is
transformed into a switched linear one by removing its intersection subspace,
which is estimated from observations. A subspace technique is proposed to
exploit the observations' permutation structure, which transforms the problem
of associating observations with subsystems into one of de-permutating a block
diagonal matrix, referred as adjacency matrix. Then a normalized spectral
clustering algorithm is presented to recover the block structure of adjacency
matrix, from which each observation is related to a particular subsystem. With
the labelled observations, parameters of the submodel are estimated via the
total least squares (TLS) estimator. The proposed technique is applicable to
switched affine systems with arbitrarily shaped domain partitions, and it
offers significantly improved performance and lowered computation complexity

star formation, it is crucial to establish the distribution, the extinction,
and the density of low-mass stars in massive star-forming regions. We analyzed
deep X-ray observations of the Orion massive star-forming region using the
Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP) catalog. We found that pre-main sequence
(PMS) low-mass stars cluster toward the three massive star-forming regions: the
Trapezium Cluster (TC), the Orion Hot Core (OHC), and OMC1-S. We derived
low-mass stellar densities of 10^{5} stars pc^{-3} in the TC and OMC1-S, and of
10^{6} stars pc^{-3} in the OHC. The close association between the low-mass
star clusters with massive star cradles supports the role of these clusters in
the formation of massive stars. The X-ray observations show for the first time
in the TC that low-mass stars with intermediate extinction are clustered toward
the position of the most massive star, which is surrounded by a ring of
non-extincted low-mass stars. Our analysis suggests that at least two basic
ingredients are needed in massive star formation: the presence of dense gas and
a cluster of low-mass stars. The scenario that better explains our findings
assumes high fragmentation in the parental core, accretion at subcore scales
that forms a low-mass stellar cluster, and subsequent competitive accretion.

and behavioural control, as early indicators of disease, endophenotypes, or a
means to relate brain structure to function, behavioural tasks are increasingly
being transferred from within-subject settings to between-group or
correlational designs. The assumption is that where we know the mechanisms
underlying within-subject effects, these effects can be used to measure
individual differences in those same mechanisms. However, between-subject
variability can arise from an entirely different source from that driving
within-subject effects, and here we report a clear-cut demonstration of this.
We examined the debated relationship between the visibility of a masked-prime
stimulus and the direction of priming it causes (positive or reversed). Such
reversal of priming has been hypothesized to reflect an automatic inhibitory
mechanism that controls partially activated responses and allows behavioural
flexibility. Within subjects, we found an unambiguous systematic transition
from reversed priming to positive priming as prime visibility increased,
replicated seven times, and using different stimulus manipulations. However,
across individuals there was never a relationship between prime discrimination
ability and priming. Specifically, these data resolve the controversial debate
on visibility and reversed priming, indicating that they arise from independent
processes relying on partially shared stimulus signals. More generally, they
stand as an exemplar case in which variance between individuals arises from a
different source from that produced by stimulus manipulations.

a violation of local Lorentz invariance. In fact, in the causal set approach to
quantum gravity, Lorentz invariance follows from the specific implementation of
the discreteness hypothesis. However, this comes at the cost of locality. In
particular, it is difficult to define a ""local"" region in a manifoldlike causal
set, i.e., one that corresponds to an approximately flat spacetime region.
Following up on suggestions from previous work, we bridge this lacuna by
proposing a definition of locality based on the abundance of m-element
order-intervals as a function of m in a causal set. We obtain analytic
expressions for the expectation value of this function for an ensemble of
causal set that faithfully embeds into an Alexandrov interval in d-dimensional
Minkowski spacetime and use it to define local regions in a manifoldlike causal
set. We use this to argue that evidence of local regions is a necessary
condition for manifoldlikeness in a causal set. This in addition provides a new
continuum dimension estimator. We perform extensive simulations which support
our claims.

sexual reproduction, characterized by its genotype composition at one

process with competition, cooperation and Mendelian reproduction. This
stochastic process is indexed by a scaling parameter $K$ that goes to infinity,
following a large population assumption. When the birth and natural death
parameters are of order $K$, the sequence of stochastic processes indexed by
$K$ converges toward a slow-fast dynamics. We indeed prove the convergence
toward 0 of a fast variable giving the deviation of the population from
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, while the sequence of slow variables giving the
respective numbers of occurrences of each allele converges toward a
2-dimensional diffusion process that reaches $(0,0)$ almost surely in finite
time. We obtain that the population size and the proportion of a given allele
converge toward a generalized Wright-Fisher diffusion with varying population
size and diploid selection. Using a non trivial change of variables, we next
study the absorption of this diffusion and its long time behavior conditioned
on non-extinction. In particular we prove that this diffusion starting from any
non-trivial state and conditioned on not hitting $(0,0)$ admits a unique
quasi-stationary distribution. We finally give numerical approximations of this

at large angular scales in the cosmic microwave background within the framework
of explicit string inflationary models where inflation is driven by a closed
string modulus parameterizing the size of the extra dimensions. In this class
of models the apparent power loss at large scales is caused by the background
dynamics which involves a sharp transition from a fast-roll power law phase to
a period of Starobinsky-like slow-roll inflation. An interesting feature of
this class of string inflationary models is that the number of e-foldings of
inflation is inversely proportional to the string coupling to a positive power.
Therefore once the string coupling is tuned to small values in order to trust
string perturbation theory, enough e-foldings of inflation are automatically
obtained without the need of extra tuning. Moreover, in the less tuned cases
the sharp transition responsible for the power loss takes place just before the
last 50-60 e-foldings of inflation. We illustrate these general claims in the
case of Fibre Inflation where we study the strength of this transition in terms
of the attractor dynamics, finding that it induces a pivot from a blue to a
redshifted power spectrum which can explain the apparent large scale power
loss. We compute the effects of this pivot for example cases and demonstrate
how magnitude and duration of this effect depend on model parameters.

near-threshold photoionization. This source is capable of producing both

example electron diffraction experiments. For both nanosecond and femtosecond
photoionization, a sinusoidal dependence of the temperature on polarization
angle has been found. For most experimental conditions, the temperature is
minimal when the polarization coincides with the direction of acceleration.
However, surprisingly, for nanosecond ionization a regime exists when the
temperature is minimal when the polarization is perpendicular to the
acceleration direction. This shows that in order to create electron bunches
with the highest transverse coherence length, it is important to control the
polarization of the ionization laser. The general trends and magnitudes of the
temperature measurements are described by a model, based on the analysis of
classical electron trajectories; this model further deepens our understanding
of the internal mechanisms during the photoionization process. Furthermore, for
nanosecond ionization, charge oscillations as a function of laser polarization
have been observed; for most situations the oscillation amplitude is small.

devices that accounts for the unusual and so far unexplained experimental
characteristics. We find that the noise power spectral density versus carrier
concentration of single-layer sheet devices has a behavior characterized by a
shape going from the M to the Gamma type as the material inhomogeneity
increases, whereas the shape becomes of V type in bilayer sheet devices for any
inhomogeneity, or of M type at high carrier concentration. In single-layer
nanoribbons, instead, the ratio of noise to resistance versus the latter
quantity is approximately constant, whereas in the bilayer case it exhibits a
linear decrease on a logarithmic scale as resistance increases and its limit
for zero resistance equals the single-layer value. Noise at the Dirac point is
much greater in single-layer than in bilayer devices and it increases with
temperature. The origin of 1/f noise is attributed to the traps in the device
and to their relaxation time dispersion. The coupling of trap charge
fluctuations with the electrode current is computed according to the
electrokinematics theorem, by taking into account their opposite effects on
electrons and holes as well as the device inhomogeneities. The results agree
well with experiments.

suspensions, star polymers, dense packing of surfactant onion micelles, and
textured morphologies of liquid crystals, share the basic ""glassy"" features of
structural disorder and metastability. These in turn give rise to several
notable features in the low frequency shear rheology (deformation and flow
properties) of these materials: in particular, the existence of a yield stress
below which the material behaves like a solid, and above which it flows like a
liquid. In the last decade, intense experimental activity has also revealed
that these materials often display a phenomenon known as shear banding, in
which the flow profile across the shear cell exhibits macroscopic bands of
different viscosity. Two distinct classes of yield stress fluid have been
identified: those in which the shear bands apparently persist permanently (for
as long as the flow remains applied), and those in which banding arises only
transiently during a process in which a steady flowing state is established out
of an initial rest state (for example, in a shear startup or step stress
experiment). After surveying the motivating experimental data, we describe
recent progress in addressing it theoretically, using the soft glassy rheology
model and a simple fluidity model. We also briefly place these theoretical
approaches in the context of others in the literature, including elasto-plastic
models, shear transformation zone theories, and molecular dynamics simulations.
We discuss finally some challenges that remain open to theory and experiment

atmosphere. Kink waves are a type of transverse MHD waves in magnetic flux
tubes that are damped due to resonant absorption. The theoretical study of kink
MHD waves in solar flux tubes is usually based on the simplification that the
transverse variation of density is confined to a nonuniform layer much thinner
than the radius of the tube, i.e., the so-called thin boundary approximation.
Here, we develop a general analytic method to compute the dispersion relation
and the eigenfunctions of ideal MHD waves in pressureless flux tubes with
transversely nonuniform layers of arbitrary thickness. Results for kink waves
are produced and are compared with fully numerical resistive MHD eigenvalue
computations in the limit of small resistivity. We find that the frequency and
resonant damping rate are the same in both ideal and resistive cases. The
actual results for thick nonuniform layers deviate from the behavior predicted
in the thin boundary approximation and strongly depend on the shape of the
nonuniform layer. The eigenfunctions in ideal MHD are very different from those
in resistive MHD. The ideal eigenfunctions display a global character
regardless of the thickness of the nonuniform layer, while the resistive
eigenfunctions are localized around the resonance and are indistinguishable
from those of ordinary resistive Alfv\'en modes. Consequently, the spatial
distribution of wave energy in the ideal and resistive cases is dramatically
different. This poses a fundamental theoretical problem with clear
observational consequences.

of Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti, Sc, and three iron-peak elements of Co, Ni, and Zn, by
using a large number of stellar data, collected by the Stellar Abundances for
Galactic Archaeology (SAGA) database. We find statistically significant
changes, or breaks, of the mean abundance ratios to iron at three metallicities
of [Fe/H]-1.8, -2.2, and -3.3. Across the first one, the mean abundance ratios
decrease with the metallicity by similar extents for all the elements with the
sufficient data. Across the latter two, downward trends with the metallicity
are also detected but for limited elements, C, Co, Zn, and possibly Sc, and for
two of Co and Zn, respectively. The breaks define four stellar populations with
the different abundance patters which are dominant in each metallicity range
divided by the breaks, Pop IIa, IIb, IIc, and IId in order of increasing
metallicity. We also explore their spatial distributions with the spectroscopic
distances to demonstrate that Pops IIa and IIb spread over the Galactic halo
while Pops IIc and IId are observed near the Galactic plane. In particular, Pop
IIc stars emerge around [Fe/H] -2.6 and coexist with Pop IIb stars, segregated
by the spatial distributions. Our results reveal two distinct modes of star
formation during the early stages of Galaxy formation, which are associated
with the variations of IMF and the spatial distribution of remnant low-mass
stars. For the two lower-metallicity populations, the enhancements of Zn and Co
indicate a high-mass and top-heavy IMF together with the statistics on the
carbon-enhanced stars. We discuss the relevance to the kinematically resolved
structures of the Galactic halo and the possible sites of these populations
within the framework of hierarchical structure formation scenario.

Profile decompositions are formulated in relation to a triplet $(X,Y,D)$, where
$X$ and $Y$ are Banach spaces, $X\hookrightarrow Y$, and $D$ is, typically, a
set of surjective isometries on both $X$ and $Y$. A profile decomposition is a
representation of a bounded sequence in $X$ as a sum of elementary
concentrations of the form $g_kw$, $g_k\in D$, $w\in X$, and a remainder that
vanishes in $Y$. A necessary requirement for $Y$ is, therefore, that any
sequence in $X$ that develops no $D$-concentrations has a subsequence
convergent in the norm of $Y$. An imbedding $X\hookrightarrow Y$ with this
property is called $D$-cocompact, a property weaker than, but related to,
compactness. We survey known cocompact imbeddings and their role in profile
decompositions.

can form a zigzag pattern when an external magnetic field induces repulsive
interparticle interactions. When the traps are abruptly turned off, the
particles form a nonequilibrium expanding pattern with a zigzag symmetry, even
when the strength of the magnetic interaction is weaker than that required to
break the linear symmetry of the equilibrium state. We show that the transition
to the equilibrium zigzag state is always potentially possible for purely
harmonic traps. For anharmonic traps that have a finite height, the equilibrium
zigzag state becomes unstable above a critical anharmonicity. A normal mode
analysis of the equilibrium line configuration demonstrates that increasing the
magnetic field leads to a hardening and softening of the spring constants in
the longitudinal and transverse directions, respectively. The mode that first
becomes unstable is the mode with the zigzag symmetry, which explains the
symmetry of nonequilibrium patterns. Our analytically tractable models help to
give further insight into the way that the interplay of such factors as the
length of the chain, hydrodynamic interactions, thermal fluctuations affect the
formation and evolution of the experimentally observed nonequilibrium patterns.

treated using a binary variable to model the on-and-off nature of signal
operation. While accurate, the use of binary variables can cause problems when
studying large networks with many intersections. Instead, the signal control
can be approximated through a continuum approach where the on-and-off control
variable is replaced by a priority parameter. Advantages of such approximation
include elimination of the need for binary variables, lower time resolution
requirements, and more flexibility and robustness in a decision environment. It
also resolves the issue of discontinuous travel time functions arising from the
context of dynamic traffic assignment. Despite these advantages in application,
it is not clear from a theoretical point of view how accurate is such continuum
approach; i.e., to what extent is this a valid approximation for the on-and-off
case. The goal of this paper is to answer these basic research questions and
provide further guidance for the application of such continuum signal model. In
particular, by employing the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model (Lighthill and
Whitham, 1955; Richards, 1956) on a traffic network, we investigate the
convergence of the on-and-off signal model to the continuum model in regimes of
diminishing signal cycles. We also provide numerical analyses on the continuum
approximation error when the signal cycles are not infinitesimal. As we
explain, such convergence results and error estimates depend on the type of
fundamental diagram assumed and whether or not vehicle spillback occurs in a
network. Finally, a traffic signal optimization problem is presented and solved
which illustrates the unique advantages of applying the continuum signal model
instead of the on-and-off one.

becomes zero, when the ratio of the fade coefficients from the end node to the

set used, called the singular fade states. Furthermore, it has been shown
recently that the problem of obtaining network coding maps which remove the
harmful effects of singular fade states, reduces to the one of obtaining Latin
Squares, which satisfy certain constraints called \textit{singularity removal
constraints}. In this paper, it is shown that the singularity removal
constraints along with the row and column exclusion conditions of a Latin
Square, can be compactly represented by a graph called the \textit{singularity

It is shown that a Latin Square which removes a singular fade state can be
obtained from a proper vertex coloring of the corresponding singularity removal
graph. The minimum number of symbols used to fill in a Latin Square which
removes a singular fade state is equal to the chromatic number of the
singularity removal graph. It is shown that for any square $M$-QAM signal set,
there exists singularity removal graphs whose chromatic numbers exceed $M$ and
hence require more than $M$ colors for vertex coloring. Also, it is shown that
for any $2^{\lambda}$-PSK signal set, $\lambda \geq 3,$ all the singularity

is designed to allow the rectification of current as well as the control of
chaos of the system. Besides the amplitude of the symmetric driving force which
is often used in this framework as control parameter, a phase has been newly
included here. Exploring this phase, responsible of the asymmetry of the driven
force, a number of interesting departures have been revealed. Remarkably, it
becomes possible to drive the system into one of the following regime: the
state of zero transport, the state of directed transport and most importantly
the state of reverse transport (current reversal). To have a full control of
the system, a current reversal diagram has been computed thereby clearly
showing the entire transport spectrum which is expected to be of interest for
possible experiments in this model.

in terms of effective propagators and vertices for the exchange objects: the
pomeron, the odderon, and the reggeons. The vertices are required to respect
standard rules of QFT. The propagators are constructed taking into account the
crossing properties of amplitudes in QFT and the power-law ansaetze from the
Regge model. We propose to describe the pomeron as an effective spin 2
exchange. This tensor pomeron gives, at high energies, the same results for the
p-p and p-pbar elastic amplitudes as the standard Donnachie-Landshoff pomeron.
But with our tensor pomeron it is much more natural to write down effective
vertices of all kinds which respect the rules of QFT. This is particularly
clear for the coupling of the pomeron to particles carrying spin, for instance
vector mesons. We describe the odderon as an effective vector exchange. We
emphasise that with a tensor pomeron and a vector odderon the corresponding
charge-conjugation relations are automatically fulfilled. We compare the model
to some experimental data, in particular to data for the total cross sections,
in order to determine the model parameters. The model should provide a starting
point for a general framework for describing soft high-energy reactions. It
should give to experimentalists an easily manageable tool for calculating
amplitudes for such reactions and for obtaining predictions which can be
compared in detail with data.

coronal seismology. We examine how a significant field-aligned flow affects
standing modes supported by coronal loops, modeled here as cold magnetic slabs.
Of particular interest are the period ratios of the fundamental to its
$(n-1)$-th overtone ($P_1/nP_n$) for both kink and sausage modes, and the
threshold half-width-to-length ratio for sausage modes. For standing kink
modes, the flow significantly reduces $P_1/nP_n$ in general, the effect being
particularly strong for larger $n$ and when the density contrast
$\rho_0/\rho_e$ between loops and their surroundings is weak. That said, even
when $\rho_0/\rho_e$ approaches infinity, this effect is still substantial,
reducing the minimal $P_1/nP_n$ by up to 13.7% (24.5%) for $n=2$ ($n=4$)
relative to the static case, when the Alfv\'en Mach number $M_A$ reaches 0.8
where $M_A$ measures the loop flow speed in units of the internal Alfv\'en
speed. For standing sausage modes, though not negligible, the flow effect in
reducing $P_1/nP_n$ is not as strong. However, the threshold
half-width-to-length ratio is considerably larger in the flowing case than its
static counterpart. For $\rho_0/\rho_e$ in the range $[9, 1024]$ and $M_A$ in
the range $[0, 0.5]$, an exhaustive parameter study yields that this threshold
is well fitted by our Equation (23) which involves the two parameters in a
simple way. This allows one to analytically constrain the combination
$(\rho_0/\rho_e, M_A)$ for a loop with known width-to-length ratio when a
standing sausage oscillation is identified therein. It also allows one to
further examine the idea of partial sausage modes, and the flow is found to
reduce significantly the spatial extent where partial modes are allowed.

Rossby wave or the baroclinic instability. In 3D, however, their formation and
stability is a complex issue and still a matter of debate. We study the
formation of vortices by the Rossby wave instability in a stratified inviscid
disk and describe their three dimensional structure, stability and long term
evolution. Numerical simulations are performed using a fully compressible
hydrodynamical code based on a second order finite volume method. We assume a
perfect gas law and a non-homentropic adiabatic flow.The Rossby wave
instability is found to proceed in 3D in a similar way as in 2D. Vortices
produced by the instability look like columns of vorticity in the whole disk
thickness; the small vertical motions are related to a weak inclination of the
vortex axis appearing during the development of the RWI. Vortices with aspect
ratios larger than 6 are unaffected by the elliptical instability. They relax
to a quasi-steady columnar structure which survives hundred of rotations while
slowly migrating inward toward the star at a rate that reduces with the vortex
aspect ratio. Vortices with a smaller aspect ratio are by contrast affected by
the elliptic instability. Short aspect ratio vortices are completely destroyed
in a few orbital periods. Vortices with an intermediate aspect ratio are
partially destroyed by the elliptical instability in a region away from the
mid-plane where the disk stratification is sufficiently large. Elongated Rossby
vortices can survive a large number of orbital periods in protoplanetary disks
in the form of vorticity columns. They could play a significant role in the
evolution of the gas and the gathering of the solid particles to form
planetesimals or planetary cores, a possibility that receives a renewed
interest with the recent discovery of a particle trap in the disk of Oph IRS48.

has a mass shell that differs from the usual free-electron mass shell, with a
form that implies that an intensity-dependent increase in mass occurs. It has
been an enticing, but elusive goal to observe this mass shift. Many schemes
have been proposed by which a definitive measurement may be made, and some
claims of success exist, but these tests are not conclusive. It is shown here
that the intense-field mass shell is not the result of a change in mass.
Rather, it is a consequence of the potential energy that a charged particle
must possess in the presence of a plane-wave field. When the effects of this
potential are incorporated in a properly covariant form, the mass shift no
longer appears and kinematical relations are conventional. If the plane-wave
pulse is sufficiently long to allow the electron to exit the field
adiabatically, then there is no alteration at all of the mass shell expression.
Other aspects of the role played by the ponderomotive 4-potential are examined.
It is also shown that the putative ""relativistic mass"" of the electron is
illusory when confronted with covariance requirements. Both ""mass increases"" of

measurement of the scattering of slow neutrons in Xenon gas is proposed. A
preliminary experiment with small statistics of 25 hours irradiation time was
performed and the observed scattering distribution is consistent with the
expectation with no additional forces. A 95% CL limit on the coupling strength
for a hypothetical force of 1 nm interaction range was evaluated to be
2*10^-15. The expected sensitivity for a planned high statistics runs is
discussed.

also study the NHDM with the maximal finite abelian symmetry for all small N

whose time T and space S satisfy T in O (n^{3/2}/S^{1/2}), smaller than
previous lower bounds for comparison-based algorithms, showing that element
distinctness is strictly easier than sorting for randomized branching programs.
This algorithm is based on a new time and space efficient algorithm for finding
all collisions of a function f from a finite set to itself that are reachable
by iterating f from a given set of starting points. We further show that our
element distinctness algorithm can be extended at only a polylogarithmic factor
cost to solve the element distinctness problem over sliding windows, where the
task is to take an input of length 2n-1 and produce an output for each window
of length n, giving n outputs in total. In contrast, we show a time-space
tradeoff lower bound of T in Omega(n^2/S) for randomized branching programs to
compute the number of distinct elements over sliding windows. The same lower
bound holds for computing the low-order bit of F_0 and computing any frequency
moment F_k, k neq 1. This shows that those frequency moments and the decision
problem F_0 mod 2 are strictly harder than element distinctness. We complement
this lower bound with a T in O(n^2/S) comparison-based deterministic RAM
algorithm for exactly computing F_k over sliding windows, nearly matching both
our lower bound for the sliding-window version and the comparison-based lower

  Opportunistic Channel Access: A Unifying Framework",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers a widely studied stochastic control problem arising from
opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) in a multi-channel system, with the goal of
providing a unifying analytical framework whereby a number of prior results may
be viewed as special cases. Specifically, we consider a single wireless
transceiver/user with access to $N$ channels, each modeled as an iid
discrete-time two-state Markov chain. In each time step the user is allowed to
sense $k\leq N$ channels, and subsequently use up to $m\leq k$ channels out of
those sensed to be available. Channel sensing is assumed to be perfect, and for
each channel use in each time step the user gets a unit reward. The user's
objective is to maximize its total discounted or average reward over a finite
or infinite horizon. This problem has previously been studied in various
special cases including $k=1$ and $m=k\leq N$, often cast as a restless bandit
problem, with optimality results derived for a myopic policy that seeks to
maximize the immediate one-step reward when the two-state Markov chain model is
positively correlated. In this paper we study the general problem with $1\leq
m\leq k\leq N$, and derive sufficient conditions under which the myopic policy
is optimal for the finite and infinite horizon reward criteria, respectively.
It is shown that these results reduce to those derived in prior studies under
the corresponding special cases, and thus may be viewed as a set of unifying
optimality conditions. Numerical examples are also presented to highlight how
and why an optimal policy may deviate from the otherwise-optimal myopic sensing
given additional exploration opportunities, i.e., when $m<k$.

either red or blue. A matching of $S$ with rectangles is any set of
pairwise-disjoint axis-aligned rectangles such that each rectangle contains
exactly two points of $S$. Such a matching is monochromatic if every rectangle
contains points of the same color, and is bichromatic if every rectangle
contains points of different colors. In this paper we study the following two
problems:
  1. Find a maximum monochromatic matching of $S$ with rectangles.
  2. Find a maximum bichromatic matching of $S$ with rectangles.
  For each problem we provide a polynomial-time approximation algorithm that
constructs a matching with at least $1/4$ of the number of rectangles of an
optimal matching. We show that the first problem is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard even if
either the matching rectangles are restricted to axis-aligned segments or $S$

on matching one-colored points with rectangles and squares, and matching
two-colored points with segments. Furthermore, using our techniques, we prove

binary fractions (up to 50%) with self-consistent treatments of stellar
dynamics and stellar evolution. We compute the formation rates and
characteristic properties of single and binary BHs for various representative
ages, cluster parameters, and metallicities. Because of dynamical interactions
and supernova (SN) kicks, more single BHs end up retained in clusters compared
to BHs in binaries. We also find that the ejection of BHs from a cluster is a
strong function of initial density. In low-density clusters (where dynamical
effects are negligible), it is mainly SN kicks that eject BHs from the cluster,
whereas in high-density clusters (initial central density $\rho_c(0) \sim 10^5
\, M_\odot\, {\rm pc}^{-3} $ in our models) the BH ejection rate is enhanced
significantly by dynamics. Dynamical interactions of binary systems in dense
clusters also modify the orbital period and eccentricity distributions while
also increasing the probability of a BH having a more massive companion.

prior works in this area, including those on channel probing and switching
policies for a single user to exploit spectral diversity, and on probing and
access policies for multiple users over a single channel to exploit temporal

multiple users over multiple channels. In addition, we consider finite
arrivals, i.e., users are not assumed to always have data to send and demand
for channel follow a certain arrival process. Under such a scenario, the users'
ability to opportunistically exploit temporal diversity (the temporal variation
in channel quality over a single channel) and spectral diversity (quality
variation across multiple channels at a given time) is greatly affected by the
level of congestion in the system. We investigate the optimal decision process
in this case, and evaluate the extent to which congestion affects potential

(decelerating) when the universe was matter dominated, because of the mutual
gravitational attraction of all the matter in it, and more recently speeding up

idea that the Universe is spatially flat (provided the dark energy density is
at least approximately time independent) and is currently undergoing an
accelerated cosmological expansion. A majority of cosmologists consider ""dark
energy"" to be the cause of this observed accelerated cosmological expansion.
  The ""standard"" model of cosmology is the spatially-flat {\Lambda}CDM model.
Although most predictions of the {\Lambda}CDM model are reasonably consistent
with measurements, the {\Lambda}CDM model has some curious features. To
overcome these difficulties, different Dark Energy models have been proposed.
Two of these models, the XCDM parametrization and the slow rolling scalar field
model $\phi$CDM, along with ""standard"" {\Lambda}CDM, with the generalization of
XCDM and $\phi$CDM in non-flat spatial geometries are considered here and
observational data are used to constrain their parameter sets.
  In this thesis, we start with a overview of the general theory of relativity,
Friedmann's equations, and distance measures in cosmology. In the following
chapters we explain how we can constrain the three above mentioned cosmological
models using three data sets: measurements of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$,
Supernova apparent magnitudes, and the BAO peak length scale, as functions of
redshift $z$. We then discuss constraints on the deceleration-acceleration
transition redshift $z_{\rm da}$ using unbinned and binned $H(z)$ data.
  Finally, we incorporate the spatial curvature in the XCDM and $\phi$CDM model
and determine observational constraints on the parameters of these expanded
models.

emphasize on tuning transmission power with either PHY or MAC layer separately,
optimally setting each Access Point's (AP's) transmission power of a densely
deployed 802.11 network considering its dual effects on both layers remains an
open problem. In this work, we design a measure by evaluating impacts of
transmission power on network performance on both PHY and MAC layers. We show
that such an optimization problem is intractable and then we investigate and
develop an analytical framework to allow simple yet efficient solutions.
Through simulations and numerical results, we observe clear benefits of the

therefore, we conclude that tuning transmission power from a dual layer

form a game theoretical framework and investigate above power-tune problem in a

statistical neuroscience. The `common input' problem presents the major
roadblock: it is difficult to reliably distinguish causal connections between
pairs of observed neurons from correlations induced by common input from
unobserved neurons. Since available recording techniques allow us to sample
from only a small fraction of large networks simultaneously with sufficient
temporal resolution, naive connectivity estimators that neglect these common
input effects are highly biased. This work proposes a `shotgun' experimental
design, in which we observe multiple sub-networks briefly, in a serial manner.
Thus, while the full network cannot be observed simultaneously at any given
time, we may be able to observe most of it during the entire experiment. Using
a generalized linear model for a spiking recurrent neural network, we develop
scalable approximate Bayesian methods to perform network inference given this
type of data, in which only a small fraction of the network is observed in each
time bin. We demonstrate in simulation that, using this method: (1) The shotgun
experimental design can eliminate the biases induced by common input effects.
(2) Networks with thousands of neurons, in which only a small fraction of the
neurons is observed in each time bin, could be quickly and accurately
estimated. (3) Performance can be improved if we exploit prior information
about the probability of having a connection between two neurons, its
dependence on neuronal cell types (e.g., Dale's law), or its dependence on the

entries with finite fourth moment, but whose fourth cumulant is nonnull, that
is, whose fourth moment may differ from the moment of a (real or complex)
Gaussian random variable. As a consequence, extra terms proportional to $ \vert
\mathcal{V}\vert ^2=\bigl|\mathbb{E}\bigl(X_{11}^n\bigr) ^2\bigr|^2$ and
$\kappa=\mathbb{E}\bigl \vert X_{11}^n\bigr \vert ^4-\vert {\mathcal{V}}\vert

depend on the spectrum of matrix $R_n$ but also on its eigenvectors. Second, we
relax the analyticity assumption over $f$ by representing the linear statistics
with the help of Helffer-Sj\""{o}strand's formula. The CLT is expressed in terms
of vanishing L\'{e}vy-Prohorov distance between the linear statistics'
distribution and a Gaussian probability distribution, the mean and the variance
of which depend upon $N$ and $n$ and may not converge.

systems and on linear programming formulations of optimal control problems. The
idea that we exploit is to first asymptotically approximate a given problem of
optimal control of the SP system by a certain averaged optimal control problem,
then reformulate this averaged problem as an infinite-dimensional (ID) linear

problems. We show that the optimal solution of these semi-infinite LP problems

complement of a homogeneous ideal $I$ of $\mathbb{C}[z_1, \ldots, z_d]$.
Arveson conjectured that $S$ is essentially normal. In this paper, we establish
new results supporting this conjecture, and connect the notion of essential
normality to the theory of the C*-envelope and the noncommutative Choquet
boundary.
  The unital norm closed algebra $\mathcal{B}_I$ generated by $S_1,\ldots,S_d$
modulo the compact operators is shown to be completely isometrically isomorphic
to the uniform algebra generated by polynomials on $\overline{V} :=
\overline{\mathcal{Z}(I) \cap \mathbb{B}_d}$, where $\mathcal{Z}(I)$ is the
variety corresponding to $I$. Consequently, the essential norm of an element in
$\mathcal{B}_I$ is equal to the sup norm of its Gelfand transform, and the
C*-envelope of $\mathcal{B}_I$ is identified as the algebra of continuous
functions on $\overline{V} \cap \partial \mathbb{B}_d$, which means it is a
complete invariant of the topology of the variety determined by $I$ in the
ball.
  Motivated by this determination of the C*-envelope of $\mathcal{B}_I$, we
suggest a new, more qualitative approach to the problem of essential normality.
We prove the tuple $S$ is essentially normal if and only if it is hyperrigid as
the generating set of a C*-algebra, which is a property closely connected to
Arveson's notion of a boundary representation.
  We show that most of our results hold in a much more general setting. In
particular, for most of our results, the ideal $I$ can be replaced by an
arbitrary (not necessarily homogeneous) invariant subspace of the $d$-shift.

a metallic ferromagnetic to insulating paramagnetic phase, which can be
controlled by an applied magnetic field. The insulating phase occurs due to
trapping of the charge carriers by polaronic lattice distortions, which raise
the resistivity. Theories based on local physics predict that the magnitude of
the resistivity jump at Tc is determined by how much, on average, the amplitude
of these distortions increases at the phase transition. Using neutron
scattering, we measured the average distortion amplitude in La0.7Sr0.3MnO3.
Surprisingly, its increase from below to above Tc is just as large as in other
manganites, which have a much larger resistivity jump. This result suggests
that the strength of CMR is determined not by the size of distortions, but by
their cooperative nature specific to each compound. Existing theories need to
be extended to include correlations between different unit cells to explain and
predict the strength of CMR.

ensure universal Kondo scaling for all D, this paper proposes an altered
definition of TK_{sc} that allows universal scaling of dynamical or thermal
quantities for a given fixed Hamiltonian. If the scaling is performed with
respect to an external parameter which directly enters the Hamiltonian, such as
magnetic field, the corresponding TK_{sc;B} for universal scaling differs, yet
becomes equivalent to TK_{sc} in the scaling limit. The only requirement for
universal scaling in the full Kondo parameter regime with a residual error of
less than 1% is a well-defined isolated Kondo feature with TK < 0.01D. By
varying D over a wide range relative to the bare energies of the impurity, for
example, this allows a smooth transition from the Anderson to the Kondo model.

  spatially-selective and internal-state-selective triggering pulses","220 pages, no figures. Minimum modification",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A spatially-selective and internal-state-selective triggering pulse is an
important component to realize the unitary dynamical state-locking process
which may be used to realize the reversible and unitary halting protocol and
construct the unstructured quantum search process based on the tensor-product
Hilbert-space symmetric structure and the unitary quantum dynamics. In this
paper it is shown how a spatially-selective and internal-state-selective
triggering pulse is constructed generally in the quantum system of a single
atom. Rigorous theoretical calculation and error estimation, which are based on
the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition method and the multiple-Gaussian-wave-packet
expansion method, are carried out for the time evolution process of a single
atom in the double-well potential field and in the presence of the
spatially-selective and internal-state-selective triggering pulse. It proves
that the spatially-selective and internal-state-selective triggering pulse is
feasible, that is, the possible errors generated by the triggering pulse are
shown to be controllable. This rigorous theoretical calculation also shows that
the spatially-selective and internal-state-selective triggering pulse may be
different from its corresponding ideal internal-state-selective triggering
pulse that is not spatially selective, but the difference between their final
states of the time evolution process is controllable. These computational
results are achieved with the help of the Gaussian wave-packet motional states
and the space-dependent quadratic Hamiltonians of a single atom. The methods
and techniques developed in the paper are useful for studying the
quantum-computing speedup mechanism of the unitary quantum dynamics in the
quantum system of a single atom.

$I_k(L)$ be the ideal generated by the $k\times k$ minors of a matrix of

development of agriculture as it allows breeders to predict the potential of
breeding for certain traits. One such phenomenon is heterosis or hybrid vigor:
crossing individuals from genetically distinct populations often results in
improvements in quantitative traits, such as growth rate, biomass production
and stress resistance. Heterosis has become a very useful tool in global
agriculture, but its genetic basis remains controversial and its effects hard
to predict. We have taken a computational approach to studying heterosis,
developing a simulation of evolution, independent reassortment of alleles and
hybridization of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) in a Boolean framework.
Fitness is measured as the ability of a network to respond to external inputs
in a pre-defined way. Our model reproduced common experimental observations on
heterosis using only biologically justified parameters. Hybrid vigor was
observed and its extent was seen to increase as parental populations diverged,
up until a point of sudden collapse of hybrid fitness. We also reproduce, for
the first time in a model, the fact that hybrid vigor cannot easily be fixed by
within a breeding line, currently an important limitation of the use of hybrid
crops. The simulation allowed us to study the effects of three standard models
for the genetic basis of heterosis and the level of detail in our model allows
us to suggest possible warning signs of the impending collapse of hybrid vigor
in breeding. In addition, the simulation provides a framework that can be
extended to study other aspects of heterosis and alternative evolutionary
scenarios.

edge-riched MoS2 pyramid platelets. This layer-dependent electrocatalysis can
be correlated to the hopping of electrons in the vertical direction of MoS2

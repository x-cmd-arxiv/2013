complement of induced odd cycle on at least 5 vertices. A graph is perfect if
the chromatic number equals the maximum clique number for every induced
subgraph. Chudnovsky, Robertson, Seymour and Thomas proved that every Berge
graph either falls into some classical family of perfect graphs, or has a
structural fault that cannot occur in a minimal imperfect graph. A corollary of
this is the strong perfect graph theorem conjectured by Berge: every Berge
graph is perfect. An even pair of vertices in a graph is a pair of vertices
such that every induced path between them has even length. Meyniel proved that
a minimal imperfect graph cannot contain an even pair. So even pairs may be
considered as a structural fault. Chudnovsky et al. do not use them, and it is
known that some classes of Berge graph have no even pairs.
  The aim of this work is to investigate an ""even-pair-like"" notion that could
be a structural fault present in every Berge graph. An odd pair of cliques is a
pair of cliques $\{K_1, K_2\}$ such that every induced path from $K_1$ to $K_2$
with no interior vertex in $K_1 \cup K_2$ has odd length. We conjecture that
for every Berge graph $G$ on at least two vertices, either one of $G, \bar{G}$
has an even pair, or one of $G, \bar{G}$ has an odd pair of cliques. We
conjecture that a minimal imperfect graph has no odd pair of maximal cliques.
We prove these conjectures in some special cases. We show that adding all edges
between any 2 vertices of the cliques of an odd pair of cliques is an operation
that preserves perfectness.

understanding the growth of supermassive black holes in the early Universe.
Some formation scenarios predict that IMBHs could have formed by runaway
collisions in globular clusters (GCs). Understanding the influence of an IMBH
in the center of a GC on its environment might provide indirect detection
methods. Our goal is to test the effects of different initial compositions of
GCs on their evolution in a tidal field. We pin down the crucial observables
that indicate the presence of an IMBH at the center of the cluster. In addition
to central IMBHs, we also consider the effects of different stellar-mass black
hole retention and stellar binary fractions. We performed a set of 22 N-body
simulations and varied particle numbers, IMBH masses, stellar-mass black-hole
retention fractions, and stellar binary fractions. These models are all run in
an external tidal field to study the effect of black holes on the cluster mass
loss, mass function, and life times. Finally, we compared our results with
observational data. We found that a central massive black hole increases the
escape rate of high-mass stars from a star cluster, implying that the relative
depletion of the mass function at the low-mass end proceeds less rapidly.
Furthermore, we found a similar behavior for a cluster hosting a high number of
stellar-mass black holes instead of one massive central IMBH. The presence of
an IMBH also weakly affects the fraction of the cluster mass that is
constituted by stellar remnants, as does the presence of primordial binaries.
We compared our simulations with observational data from the literature and
found good agreement between our models and observed mass functions and
structural parameters of GCs. We exploited this agreement to identify GCs that
could potentially host IMBHs.

widely used in evolutionary modeling. The equation which reads R=h^{2}S relates

proportionality relation. The validity of this relation however relies strongly
on the normal (Gaussian) distribution of parent's genotype which is an

  Tamper-resilient storage; Cryptography; Information theory",,,,"cs.IT cs.CC cs.CR math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Non-malleable codes, introduced by Dziembowski, Pietrzak and Wichs (ICS
2010), encode messages $s$ in a manner so that tampering the codeword causes
the decoder to either output $s$ or a message that is independent of $s$. While
this is an impossible goal to achieve against unrestricted tampering functions,
rather surprisingly non-malleable coding becomes possible against every fixed
family $F$ of tampering functions that is not too large (for instance, when
$|F| \le \exp(2^{\alpha n})$ for some $\alpha \in [0, 1)$ where $n$ is the
number of bits in a codeword).
  In this work, we study the ""capacity of non-malleable coding"", and establish
optimal bounds on the achievable rate as a function of the family size,
answering an open problem from Dziembowski et al. (ICS 2010). Specifically,
  1. We prove that for every family $F$ with $|F| \le \exp(2^{\alpha n})$,
there exist non-malleable codes against $F$ with rate arbitrarily close to
$1-\alpha$ (this is achieved w.h.p. by a randomized construction).
  2. We show the existence of families of size $\exp(n^{O(1)} 2^{\alpha n})$
against which there is no non-malleable code of rate $1-\alpha$ (in fact this
is the case w.h.p for a random family of this size).
  3. We also show that $1-\alpha$ is the best achievable rate for the family of
functions which are only allowed to tamper the first $\alpha n$ bits of the
codeword, which is of special interest.
  As a corollary, this implies that the capacity of non-malleable coding in the
split-state model (where the tampering function acts independently but
arbitrarily on the two halves of the codeword) equals 1/2.
  We also give an efficient Monte Carlo construction of codes of rate close to
1 with polynomial time encoding and decoding that is non-malleable against any
fixed $c > 0$ and family $F$ of size $\exp(n^c)$, in particular tampering
functions with, say, cubic size circuits.

single-photon pairs in the $X$ and $Z$ bases must be the same, if we have lower
bound of the value in one basis, we can also use this as the lower bound in
another basis. Since in the existing set-up for MDI-QKD, the yield of sources
in different bases are normally different, therefore our method can improve the
key rate drastically if we choose to only use the lower bound of yield of
single-photon pairs in the advantageous basis. Moreover, since our proposal
here uses fewer intensities of light, the probability of intensity mismatch
will be smaller than the existing protocols do. This will further improve the

coupled system. It is found that the leading term in the gauge coupling beta
function comes due to interaction of gauge fields with gravitons. This is shown
to be a universal quantity in the sense that it doesn't depend on the gauge
coupling and the gauge group, but may depend on the other couplings of the
action (gravitational and matter). The coupled system is studied at one-loop.
It is found that the leading term of gauge beta function is zero at one-loop in
four dimensions. The effect of gauge fields on the running of gravitational
couplings is investigated. The coupled system of gauge field with
higher-derivative gravity is shown to satisfy unitarity when quantum
corrections are taken in to account. Moreover, it is found that Newton constant
goes to zero at short distances. In this renormalizable and unitary theory of
gauge field coupled with higher-derivative gravity, the leading term of the
gauge beta function, found to be universal for all gauge groups, is further
studied in more detail by isolating it in the context of abelian gauge theories
coupled with gravity in four dimensions. Using self-duality of abelian gauge
theories in four dimensions, this term of the gauge beta function is shown to
be zero to all loops. This is found to be independent of the gravity action,
regularization scheme and gauge fixing condition. An explicit one-loop
computation for arbitrary gravity action further demonstrates the vanishing of
this term in the gauge beta function in four dimensions, independent of the
regularization scheme and gauge fixing condition. Consequences of this are
discussed.

intrinsic properties must be treated as indistinguishable if the theory is to
give valid predictions. In the quantum formalism, indistinguishability is
expressed via the symmetrization postulate, which restricts a system of
identical particles to the set of symmetric states (`bosons') or the set of
antisymmetric states (`fermions'). However, the physical basis and range of
validity of the symmetrization postulate has not been established. A well-known
topological derivation of the postulate implies that its validity depends on
the dimensionality of the space in which the particles move. However, this
derivation relies on the labeling of indistinguishable particles, a notion that
cannot be justified on an informational basis. Here we show that the
symmetrization postulate can be derived by strictly adhering to the
informational requirement that particles which cannot be experimentally
distinguished from one another are not labeled. Our key novel postulate is the
operational indistinguishability postulate, which posits that the amplitude of
a process involving several indistinguishable particles is determined by the
amplitudes of all possible transitions of these particles when treated as
distinguishable. The symmetrization postulate follows by requiring consistency
with the rest of the quantum formalism. The derivation implies that the
symmetrization postulate admits no natural variants. In particular, the
possibility that identical particles generically exhibit anyonic behavior in
two dimensions is excluded.

kernel matrix from relative comparisons of the form: ""object A is more similar
to object B than it is to C"", where comparisons are given by humans. Existing
solutions to this problem assume many comparisons are provided to learn a high
quality kernel. However, this can be considered unrealistic for many real-world
tasks since relative assessments require human input, which is often costly or
difficult to obtain. Because of this, only a limited number of these
comparisons may be provided. In this work, we explore methods for aiding the
process of learning a kernel with the help of auxiliary kernels built from more
easily extractable information regarding the relationships among objects. We
propose a new kernel learning approach in which the target kernel is defined as
a conic combination of auxiliary kernels and a kernel whose elements are
learned directly. We formulate a convex optimization to solve for this target
kernel that adds only minor overhead to methods that use no auxiliary
information. Empirical results show that in the presence of few training
relative comparisons, our method can learn kernels that generalize to more

equ tions of motion governing linear, adiabatic, radial perturbations of stars

equation for the period of stellar oscillations is modified such that the
eigenfrequencies are always larger than predicted by General Relativity.
Second, the General Relativity condition for stellar instability is altered so
that the adiabatic index can fall below 4/3 before unstable modes appear. Stars
are more stable in modified gravity theories. Specialising to the case of
chameleon-like theories, we investigate these effects numerically using both
polytropic Lane-Emden stars and models coming from modified gravity stellar
structure simulations. The change in the oscillation period can be as large as
50% and the critical adiabatic index for instability falls by a composition
dependent amount of order 10^(-1). By solving the new equation for Cepheid
models, it is found that the change in the inferred distance using the
period-luminosity relation can be up to three times larger than if one had only
considered the modified equilibrium structure. We discuss the implications of
these results for recent and up-coming astrophysical tests and estimate that
previous methods can produce new constraints such that the modifications are

Kondo-Heisenberg model on a honeycomb lattice at half filling. The problem is
approached from the Kondo destroyed, antiferromagnetically ordered insulating
phase. We describe the local moments in terms of a coarse grained quantum
non-linear sigma model, and show that the skyrmion defects of the
antiferromagnetic order parameter host a number of competing order parameters.
In addition to the spin Peierls, charge and current density wave order
parameters, we identify for the first time Kondo singlets as the competing
orders of the antiferromagnetism. We show that the antiferromagnetism and
various competing singlet orders can be related to each other via generalized
chiral transformations of the underlying fermions. We also show that the
conduction electrons acquire a Berry phase through their coupling to the
hedgehog configurations of the N\'eel order, which cancels the Berry phase of
the local moments. Our results demonstrate the competition between the
Kondo-singlet formation and spin-Peierls order when the antiferromagnetic order
is suppressed, thereby shedding new light on the global phase diagram of heavy

obstacles, we have cross-matched the Pan-STARRS1 (optical) and WISE (mid-IR)

that either (1) its gas represents the initial conditions for high-redshift
starbursts or (2) some yet unidentified process consistently suppresses star
formation over >100 Myr time-scales. We conclude that the MW contains large

that a relationship exists for typical star-forming galaxies at z = 1 - 1.5 and
that it is surprisingly similar to that seen locally. Therefore, star-forming
galaxies at z = 1 - 1.5 are no less metal abundant than galaxies of similar
mass and star formation rate (SFR) at z = 0.1, contrary to claims from some
earlier studies. We conclude that the bulk of the metal enrichment for this
star-forming galaxy population takes place in the 4 Gyr before z = 1.5. We fit
a new mass-metallicity-SFR plane to our data which is consistent with other
high redshift studies. However, there is some evidence that the
mass-metallicity component of this high redshift plane is flattened, at all
SFR, compared with z = 0.1, suggesting that processes such as star-formation
driven winds, thought to remove enriched gas from low mass halos, are yet to
have as large an impact at this early epoch. The negative slope of the
SFR-metallicity relation from this new plane is consistent with the picture
that the elevation in the SFR of typical galaxies at z > 1 is fuelled by the
inflow of metal-poor gas and not major merging.

undergoing inside-out clearing by photoevaporation. In particular, we aim to
characterise the conditions under which a protoplanetary disc may undergo
`thermal sweeping', a rapid (< 1e4 years) disc destruction mechanism proposed
to occur when a clearing disc reaches sufficiently low surface density at its
inner edge and where the disc is unstable to runaway penetration by the X-rays.
We use a large suite of 1D radiation-hydrodynamic simulations to probe the
observable parameter space, which is unfeasible in higher dimensions. These
models allow us to determine the surface density at which thermal sweeping will
take over the disc's evolution and to evaluate this critical surface density as
a function of X-ray luminosity, stellar mass and inner hole radius. We find
that this critical surface density scales linearly with X-ray luminosity,
increases with inner hole radius and decreases with stellar mass and we develop
an analytic model that reproduces these results.
  This surface density criterion is then used to determine the evolutionary
state of protoplanetary discs at the point that they become unstable to
destruction by thermal sweeping. We find that transition discs created by
photoevaporation will undergo thermal sweeping when their inner holes reach
20-40 AU, implying that transition discs with large holes and no accretion
(which were previously a predicted outcome of the later stages of all flavours
of photoevaporation model) will not form.
  We emphasise that the surface density criteria that we have developed apply
to all situations where the disc develops an inner hole that is optically thin
to X-rays. It thus applies not only to the case of holes originally created by
photoevaporation but also to holes formed, for example, by the tidal influence

~2.1 hr (2XMM J133135.2-315541) and are probably magnetic cataclysmic

intermittent ~3.8 hr quasi-periodic oscillation. There are six other very soft
sources (with kT<0.2 keV), which might be in other galaxies with luminosities
between ~10^{38}-10^{42} erg/s. They probably represent a diverse group that
might include objects such as ultrasoft AGNs and cool thermal disk emission
from accreting intermediate-mass black holes. Six highly variable sources with
harder spectra are probably in nearby galaxies with luminosities above 10^{37}
erg/s and thus are great candidates for extragalactic X-ray binaries. One of
them (2XMMi J004211.2+410429, in M 31) is probably a new-born persistent
source, having been X-ray bright and hard in 0.3--10 keV for at least four
years since it was discovered to enter an outburst in 2007. Three highly
variable hard sources appear at low galactic latitudes and have maximum
luminosities below ~10^{34} erg/s if they are in our Galaxy, thus great
candidates for cataclysmic variables or very faint X-ray transients harboring a
black hole or neutron star. Our interpretations of these sources can be tested
with future long-term X-ray monitoring and multi-wavelength observations.

sub-solar (Holmberg II, NGC 1569, NGC 4214, NGC 4449, and NGC 5253), solar (He
2-10, NGC 3077) and super-solar (NGC 5236) for consistent shock measurements.
For the sub-solar sub-sample, we derive three scaling relations: (1) $L_{shock}
\propto {SFR}^{~0.62}$, (2) $L_{shock} \propto {\Sigma_{SFR,HL}}^{~0.92}$, and
(3) $L_{shock}/L_{tot} \propto {(L_H/L_{\odot,H})}^{-0.65}$, where $L_{shock}$

the absolute H-band luminosity from 2MASS normalized to solar luminosity. The
other two sub--samples do not have enough number statistics, but appear to
follow the first scaling relation. The energy recovered indicates that the
shocks from stellar feedback in our sample galaxies are fully radiative. If the
scaling relations are applicable in general to stellar feedback, our results
are similar to those by Hopkins et al. (2012) for galactic super winds. This
similarity should, however, be taken with caution at this point, as the
underlying physics that enables the transition from radiative shocks to gas
outflows in galaxies is still poorly understood.

unsteady flows. CROM combines the cluster analysis pioneered in Gunzburger's
group (Burkardt et al. 2006) and and transition matrix models introduced in
fluid dynamics in Eckhardt's group (Schneider et al. 2007). CROM constitutes a
potential alternative to POD models and generalises the Ulam-Galerkin method
classically used in dynamical systems to determine a finite-rank approximation
of the Perron-Frobenius operator. The proposed strategy processes a
time-resolved sequence of flow snapshots in two steps. First, the snapshot data
are clustered into a small number of representative states, called centroids,
in the state space. These centroids partition the state space in complementary
non-overlapping regions (centroidal Voronoi cells). Departing from the standard
algorithm, the probabilities of the clusters are determined, and the states are
sorted by analysis of the transition matrix. Secondly, the transitions between
the states are dynamically modelled using a Markov process. Physical mechanisms
are then distilled by a refined analysis of the Markov process, e.g. using
finite-time Lyapunov exponent and entropic methods. This CROM framework is
applied to the Lorenz attractor (as illustrative example), to velocity fields
of the spatially evolving incompressible mixing layer and the three-dimensional
turbulent wake of a bluff body. For these examples, CROM is shown to identify
non-trivial quasi-attractors and transition processes in an unsupervised
manner. CROM has numerous potential applications for the systematic
identification of physical mechanisms of complex dynamics, for comparison of
flow evolution models, for the identification of precursors to desirable and
undesirable events, and for flow control applications exploiting nonlinear
actuation dynamics.

number of smaller subhalos. As a result of the dark matter annihilations taking
place within such objects, the most nearby and massive subhalos could appear as
point-like or spatially extended gamma-ray sources, without observable
counterparts at other wavelengths. In this paper, we use the results of the
Aquarius simulation to predict the distribution of nearby subhalos, and compare
this to the characteristics of the unidentified gamma-ray sources observed by
the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope. Focusing on the brightest high latitude
sources, we use this comparison to derive limits on the dark matter
annihilation cross section. For dark matter particles lighter than ~200 GeV,
the resulting limits are the strongest obtained to date, being modestly more
stringent than those derived from observations of dwarf galaxies or the
Galactic Center. We also derive independent limits based on the lack of
unidentified gamma-ray sources with discernible spatial extension, but these
limits are a factor of ~2-10 weaker than those based on point-like subhalos.
Lastly, we note that four of the ten brightest high-latitude sources exhibit a
similar spectral shape, consistent with 30-60 GeV dark matter particles
annihilating to b quarks with an annihilation cross section on the order of
sigma v ~ (5-10) x 10^-27 cm^3/s, or 8-10 GeV dark matter particles

Universe, in many cases, exhibit an unusually low N/O abundance ratio (log N/O
~ -1.5) in H II regions as compared with the solar value (~-0.9). This ratio is
broadly equivalent to the average level of extremely metal-poor stars in the
Galactic halo, suggesting that N released from asymptotic giant branch (AGB)
stars is missing in the present-day interstellar matter of these dIrrs. We find
evidence for past tidal interactions in the properties of individual dIrrs
exhibiting low N/O ratios, while a clear signature of interactions is unseen
for dIrrs with high N/O ratios. Accordingly, we propose that the ejecta of
massive AGB stars that correspond to a major production site of N can be
stripped from dIrrs that have undergone a strong interaction with a luminous
galaxy. The physical process of its stripping is made up of two stages: (i) the
ejecta of massive AGB stars in a dIrr are first merged with those of the
bursting prompt SNe Ia and pushed up together to the galaxy halo, and (ii)
subsequently through tidal interactions with a luminous galaxy, these ejecta
are stripped from a dwarf galaxy's potential well. Our new chemical evolution
models with stripping of AGB ejecta succeed in reproducing the observed low N/O
ratio. Furthermore, we perform N-body + hydrodynamical simulations to trace the
fate of AGB ejecta inside a dIrr orbiting the Milky Way, and confirm that a
tidal interaction is responsible for the efficient stripping of AGB ejecta from
dIrrs.

potential for any scalar field $\phi$ coupling to the emitted quanta. Due to
energetic considerations, $\phi$ evolves locally to minimize the effective
masses of the outgoing states. In theories where $\phi$ resides at a metastable
minimum, this effect can drive $\phi$ over its potential barrier and
classically catalyze the decay of the vacuum. Because this is not a tunneling
process, the decay rate is not exponentially suppressed and a single black hole
in our past light cone may be sufficient to activate the decay. Moreover,
decaying black holes radiate at ever higher temperatures, so they eventually
probe the full spectrum of particles coupling to $\phi$. We present a detailed
analysis of vacuum decay catalyzed by a single particle, as well as by a black
hole. The former is possible provided large couplings or a weak potential
barrier. In contrast, the latter occurs much more easily and places new
stringent limits on theories with hierarchical spectra. Finally, we comment on

still allowing the graph topology to change freely over time. In this
direction, a first contribution of this work is an extension of rigidity theory
to weighted frameworks and the rigidity eigenvalue, which when positive ensures
the infinitesimal rigidity of the framework. We then propose a distributed
algorithm for estimating a common relative position reference frame amongst a
team of robots with only range measurements in addition to one agent endowed
with the capability of measuring the bearing to two other agents. This first
estimation step is embedded into a subsequent distributed algorithm for
estimating the rigidity eigenvalue associated with the weighted framework. The
estimate of the rigidity eigenvalue is finally used to generate a local control
action for each agent that both maintains the rigidity property and enforces
additional con- straints such as collision avoidance and sensing/communication
range limits and occlusions. As an additional feature of our approach, the
communication and sensing links among the robots are also left free to change
over time while preserving rigidity of the whole framework. The proposed scheme
is then experimentally validated with a robotic testbed consisting of 6
quadrotor UAVs operating in a cluttered environment.

probability. Under this more realistic picture and based on the precision of
COBE's measurement of CMB (cosmic microwave background) blackbody spectrum, we
find an upper bound for the primordial magnetic field strength, B < 30G, at the
time of recombination. Although at present the bound based on the
photon-graviton conversion mechanism is not as tight as that obtained by the
direct use of CMB temperature anisotropy, it nevertheless provides an important
independent constraint on primordial magnetic fields and at epochs in addition
to the recombination. The bound can be significantly improved if the CMB
blackbody spectrum measurement becomes more precise in future experiments such

how mutations interact with genetic background to influence gene expression,

novel genome level datasets from a mapping by introgression experiment and a
tagged RNA gene expression dataset. In addition we used whole genome

predict polymorphic transcription factor binding sites for SD. We integrated
these data with previously published genomic datasets from expression
microarrays and a modifier mutation screen. By searching for genes showing a
congruent signal across multiple datasets, we were able to identify a robust
set of candidate loci contributing to the background dependent effects of
mutations in sd. We also show that the majority of background-dependent

quantitative non-complementation. These findings provide a useful foundation

commonly adopted by the astronomical community. One approach aims to derive the
main stellar photospheric parameters and abundances of a few elements by
analysing high-resolution spectra from a given public library homogeneously
constructed. The other one is applied to recover the abundance of a single
element in stars with known photospheric parameters by using mid-resolution
spectra from another open homogeneous database and calibrating derived
abundances. Both semi-automated computational approaches provide homogeneity

partial and final results as well as to estimate measurement errors, making
possible to systematically evaluate and improve the distinct steps.

architectural constraints imposed by the FSB speed, the spatial and temporal

monoid M over a ring D is a right and/or left fir (free ideal ring), a semifir,
or a 2-fir (definitions recalled in section 1). It is known that for M
nontrivial, a necessary condition for any of these properties to hold is that D
be a division ring. Under that assumption, necessary and sufficient conditions
on M are known for DM to be a right or left fir, and various conditions on M
have been proved necessary or sufficient for DM to be a 2-fir or semifir.
  A sufficient condition for DM to be a semifir is that M be a direct limit of
monoids which are free products of free monoids and free groups. W.Dicks has
conjectured that this is also necessary. However F.Ced\'o has given an example
of a monoid M which is not such a direct limit, but satisfies the known
necessary conditions for DM to be a semifir. It is an open question whether for
this M, the rings DM are semifirs.
  We note some reformulations of the known necessary conditions for DM to be a
2-fir or a semifir, motivate Ced\'o's construction and a variant, and recover
Ced\'o's results for both constructions.
  Any homomorphism from a monoid M into \Z induces a \Z-grading on DM, and we
show that for the two monoids in question, the rings DM are ""homogeneous
semifirs"" with respect to all such nontrivial \Z-gradings; i.e., have (roughly)
the property that every finitely generated homogeneous one-sided ideal is free.
  If M is a monoid such that DM is an n-fir, and N a ""well-behaved"" submonoid
of M, we obtain results on DN. Using these, we show that for M a monoid such
that DM is a 2-fir, mutual commutativity is an equivalence relation on
nonidentity elements of M, and each equivalence class, together with the
identity element, is a directed union of infinite cyclic groups or infinite
cyclic monoids.
  Several open questions are noted.

FER performance to approach that of full-precision soft information and enables
an LDPC code to significantly outperform a BCH code. A constant-ratio
constraint provides a significant simplification in the optimization with no
noticeable loss in performance. For a well-designed LDPC code, the quantization
that maximizes the mutual information also minimizes the frame error rate in
our simulations. However, for an example LDPC code with a high error floor
caused by small absorbing sets, the MMI quantization does not provide the
lowest frame error rate. The best quantization in this case introduces more
erasures than would be optimal for the channel MI in order to mitigate the
absorbing sets of the poorly designed code. The paper also identifies a
trade-off in LDPC code design when decoding is performed with multiple
precision levels; the best code at one level of precision will typically not be

the Swift-XRT light curves, vexing features of GRB phenomenology. This process
is an integral part of the ""supercritical pile"" GRB model, proposed a few years
ago to provide an account for the conversion of the GRB kinetic energy into
radiation with a spectral peak at $E_{\rm pk} \sim m_ec^2$. We compute the
evolution of the relativistic blast wave (RBW) Lorentz factor $\Gamma$ to show
that the radiation--reaction force due to the GRB emission can produce an
abrupt, small ($\sim 25%$) decrease in $\Gamma$ at a radius which is smaller
(depending on conditions) than the deceleration radius $R_D$. Because of this
reduction, the kinematic criticality criterion of the ""supercritical pile"" is
no longer fulfilled. Transfer of the proton energy into electrons ceases, and
the GRB enters abruptly the afterglow phase at a luminosity smaller by $\sim
m_p/m_e$ than that of the prompt emission. If the radius at which this
slow-down occurs is significantly smaller than $R_D$, the RBW internal energy
continues to drive the RBW expansion at a constant (new) $\Gamma$, and its
X-ray luminosity remains constant until $R_D$ is reached, at which point it
resumes its more conventional decay, thereby completing the ""unexpected"" XRT
light curve phase. If this transition occurs at $R \simeq R_D$, the steep
decline is followed by a flux decrease instead of a ""plateau"", consistent with
the conventional afterglow declines. Besides providing an account of these
peculiarities, the model suggests that the afterglow phase may in fact begin
before the RBW reaches $R \simeq R_D$, thus introducing novel insights into the
GRB phenomenology.

survey data and in user ratings when respondents are mixed in their opinion.
They also arise in censored count data, where the highest category might create
an additional mode. Modeling bimodal behavior in discrete data is useful for
various purposes, from comparing shapes of different samples (or survey
questions) to predicting future ratings by new raters. The Poisson distribution
is the most common distribution for fitting count data and can be modified to
achieve mixtures of truncated Poisson distributions. However, it is suitable
only for modeling equi-dispersed distributions and is limited in its ability to
capture bimodality. The Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (CMP) distribution is a
two-parameter generalization of the Poisson distribution that allows for over-
and under-dispersion. In this work, we propose a mixture of CMPs for capturing
a wide range of truncated discrete data, which can exhibit unimodal and bimodal
behavior. We present methods for estimating the parameters of a mixture of two
CMP distributions using an EM approach. Our approach introduces a special
two-step optimization within the M step to estimate multiple parameters. We
examine computational and theoretical issues. The methods are illustrated for
modeling ordered rating data as well as truncated count data, using simulated
and real examples.

map into square patches and exploit the information in the Fourier space. For
patches containing bright extra-galactic point sources, we can directly
estimate their shapes, from which the inflight effective beam manifests itself.
For those without, we estimate the pattern via perturbing the phases and
directly from the Fourier amplitudes. We show that the inflight effective beam
convolving the signal is indeed non-symmetric for most part of the sky, and
it's not randomly oriented. Around the ecliptic poles, however, the asymmetry
is smaller due to the averaging effect from different orientations of the beam
from the scan strategy. The effective beam with significant asymmetry is
combing with almost parallel fashion along the lines of Ecliptic longitude. In
the foreground-cleaned ILC map, however, the systematics caused by beam effect
is significantly lessened.

to derive an oxygen abundance gradient in NGC 628 based solely on ""direct""
oxygen abundances of H II regions: 12 + log(O/H) = (8.43+/-0.03) +
(-0.017+/-0.002) x Rg (dex/kpc), with a dispersion in log(O/H) of {\sigma} =
0.10 dex, from 14 regions with a radial coverage of ~2-19 kpc. This is a
significantly shallower slope than found by previous ""strong-line"" abundance
studies. In NGC 2403, we derive an oxygen abundance gradient of 12 + log(O/H) =
(8.48+/-0.04) + (-0.032+/-0.007) x Rg (dex/kpc), with a dispersion in log(O/H)
of {\sigma} = 0.07 dex, from 7 H II with a radial coverage of ~1-10 kpc.
  Additionally, we measure the N, S, Ne, and Ar abundances. We find the N/O
ratio decreases with increasing radius for the inner disk, but reaches a
plateau past R25 in NGC 628. NGC 2403 also has a negative N/O gradient with
radius, but we do not sample the outer disk of the galaxy past R25 and so do
not see evidence for a plateau. This bi-modal pattern measured for NGC 628
indicates dominant contributions from secondary nitrogen inside of the R25
transition and dominantly primary nitrogen farther out. As expected for
{\alpha}-process elements, S/O, Ne/O, and Ar/O are consistent with constant
values over a range in oxygen abundance.

well documented, despite the nearly factor 30 variation observed among the
effective active fractions of these comets, X is constant to within a factor
two. We present an analysis for the sungrazing comet C/2012 S1 (ISON) to

occur. Additional causes for rotational state changes near perihelion for ISON

IPT was deemed to be the best solution to the system houses a multi parameter
acquisition module such as temperature, speed, voltage, current and data
transfer from the motor. The receiver side is another microcontroller coupled
to an inductive coil that gets the data and displays in the LCD. A brief
background to IPT Inductive Power Transfer technology and its applications is
given and the design criteria for the paper are defined in detail. To be
accurate, IPT data communication helps to reduce unnecessary wire connections
and data is transmitted without any touch. Further the paper can be enhanced by
looking for fault analysis inside the motor. This can be done by analyzing
various parameters of the motor. A novel two-way IPT communication system was
designed, which worked on the concept of pulsing the system on and off to send
data serially. The paper involves transmission of data through inductive flux
without any contact between the two modules. Further as no frequency tunings or
any calibration is required between different modules a single system can be
used with multiple clients. This reduces a lot of hazards such as interference
with other modules and RF transmitters in the vicinity.

mesons to find a better ground state wave function than the mean field

physical $\sigma$ and $\pi$ masses. We recover the Nambu-Goldstone theorem for
the physical pion mass to be zero in the chiral limit. The $\sigma$ meson is a
strongly correlated meson-meson state, and has a 4 quark structure. We
calculate $\sigma$ and $\pi$ masses as functions of temperature for the two
cases of chiral limit and explicit chiral symmetry breaking. We get similar
behaviors for the $\sigma$ and $\pi$ masses as the case of the mean field
approximation, but the coupling constants are much larger than the values of
the case of the mean field approximation.

theoretical model to show role of binding sites in DevR mediated gene
expression. Individual and collective role of binding sites in regulating DevR
mediated gene expression has been shown via modeling. Objective of the present
work is two fold. First, to describe qualitatively the temporal dynamics of
wild type genes and their known mutants. Based on these results we propose that
DevR controlled gene expression follows a specific pattern which is efficient
in describing other DevR mediated gene expression. Second, to analyze behavior
of the system from information theoretical point of view. Using the tools of
information theory we have calculated molecular efficiency of the system and
have shown that it is close to the maximum limit of isothermal efficiency.

of intermediate-mass, extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars. We also aim to
investigate their C, N, and O yields. Using the Monash University Stellar
Evolution code we computed and analysed the evolution of stars of metallicity Z
= 10^-5 and masses between 4 and 9 M_sun, from their main sequence until the
late thermally pulsing (super) asymptotic giant branch, TP-(S)AGB phase. Our
model stars experience a strong C, N, and O envelope enrichment either due to
the second dredge-up, the dredge-out phenomenon, or the third dredge-up early
during the TP-(S)AGB phase. Their late evolution is therefore similar to that
of higher metallicity objects. When using a standard prescription for the mass
loss rates during the TP-(S)AGB phase, the computed stars lose most of their
envelopes before their cores reach the Chandrasekhar mass, so our standard
models do not predict the occurrence of SNI1/2 for Z = 10^-5 stars. However, we
find that the reduction of only one order of magnitude in the mass-loss rates,
which are particularly uncertain at this metallicity, would prevent the
complete ejection of the envelope, allowing the stars to either explode as an
SNI1/2 or become an electron-capture SN. Our calculations stop due to an
instability near the base of the convective envelope that hampers further
convergence and leaves remnant envelope masses between 0.25 M_sun for our 4
M_sun model and 1.5 M_sun for our 9 M_sun model. We present two sets of C, N,
and O yields derived from our full calculations and computed under two
different assumptions, namely, that the instability causes a practically
instant loss of the remnant envelope or that the stars recover and proceed with
further thermal pulses. Our results have implications for the early chemical
evolution of the Universe.

field and the deviations from the general relativistic solutions are studied.
Two examples of scalar-tensor theories are examined - one case that is
equivalent to the Brans-Dicke theory and a second case, that is perturbatively
equivalent to Einstein's General Relativity in the weak field regime, but can
differ significantly for strong fields. Our numerical results show that rapidly
rotating neutron star models with a nontrivial scalar field exist in both cases
and that the effect of the scalar field is stronger for rapid rotation. If we
consider values of the coupling parameters in accordance with current
observations, only the second example of scalar-tensor theories has significant
influence on the neutron star structure. We show that scalarized, rapidly
rotating neutron stars exist for a larger range of the parameters than in the
static case, since a nontrivial scalar field is present even for values of the
coupling constant $\beta>-4.35$, and that these solutions are energetically
more favorable than the general relativistic ones. In addition, the deviations
of the rapidly rotating scalar-tensor neutron stars from the
general-relativistic solutions is significantly larger than in the static case.

barrier, we demonstrate that the relativistic tunnel-ionization can be well
described by a one-dimensional intuitive picture. This picture predicts that,
in contrast to the well-known nonrelativistic regime, the ionized electron wave
packet arises with a momentum shift along the laser's propagation direction.
This is compatible with results from a strong field approximation calculation
where the binding potential is assumed to be zero-ranged. Further, the
tunneling time delay, stemming from Wigner's definition, is investigated for
model configurations of tunneling and compared with results obtained from the
exact propagator. By adapting Wigner's time delay definition to the ionization
process, the tunneling time is investigated in the deep-tunneling and in the
near-threshold-tunneling regimes. It is shown that while in the deep-tunneling
regime signatures of the tunneling time delay are not measurable at remote
distance, it is detectable, however, in the latter regime.

self-correcting properties and a lifetime growing arbitrarily with system size
at non-zero temperature. This is achieved by locally coupling a 2D L x L toric
code to a 3D bath of bosons hopping on a cubic lattice. When the stabilizer
operators of the toric code are coupled to the displacement operator of the
bosons, we solve the model exactly via a polaron transformation and show that
the energy penalty to create anyons grows linearly with L. When the stabilizer
operators of the toric code are coupled to the bosonic density operator, we use
perturbation theory to show that the energy penalty for anyons scales with
ln(L). For a given error model, these energy penalties lead to a lifetime of
the stored quantum information growing respectively exponentially and
polynomially with L. Furthermore, we show how to choose an appropriate coupling
scheme in order to hinder the hopping of anyons (and not only their creation)
with energy barriers that are of the same order as the anyon creation gaps. We
argue that a toric code coupled to a 3D Heisenberg ferromagnet realizes our
model in its low-energy sector. Finally, we discuss the delicate issue of the
stability of topological order in the presence of perturbations. While we do
not derive a rigorous proof of topological order, we present heuristic
arguments suggesting that topological order remains intact when perturbative
operators acting on the toric code spins are coupled to the bosonic
environment.

that many breather solutions of integrable equations satisfy suitable
variational elliptic equations, which also implies that the stability problem
reduces in some sense to $(i)$ the study of the spectrum of explicit linear
systems (\emph{spectral stability}), and $(ii)$ the understanding of how bad
directions (if any) can be controlled using low regularity conservation laws.
We exemplify this idea in the case of the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV),
Gardner, and sine-Gordon (SG) equations. Then we perform numerical simulations
that confirm, at the level of the spectral problem, our previous rigorous
results, where we showed that mKdV breathers are $H^2$ and $H^1$ stable,
respectively. In a second step, we also discuss the Gardner and the Sine-Gordon
cases, where the spectral study of a fourth-order linear matrix system is the
key element to show stability. Using numerical methods, we confirm that all
spectral assumptions leading to the $H^2\times H^1$ stability of SG breathers
are numerically satisfied, even in the ultra-relativistic, singular regime. In
a second part, we study the periodic mKdV case, where a periodic breather is
known from the work of Kevrekidis et al. We rigorously show that these
breathers satisfy a suitable elliptic equation, and we also show numerical
spectral stability. However, we also identify the source of nonlinear
instability in the case described in Kevrekidis et al. Finally, we present a
new class of breather solution for mKdV, believed to exist from geometric
considerations, and which is periodic in time and space, but has nonzero mean,
unlike standard breathers.

time difference between the appearance of the strong flows and the linear
polarization. We also obtained the distances from the center of various
features to the nearest neutral lines and whether they overlap or not. These
distances were compared with those obtained from randomly distributed points on
observed magnetograms. Various cases of strong flows are described in some
detail. The linear polarization signals precede the appearance of the strong
flows by on average 84+-11 seconds. The strongly Doppler-shifted signals are
closer (0.19"") to magnetic neutral lines than randomly distributed points
(0.5""). Eighty percent of the strongly Doppler-shifted signals are close to a
neutral line that is located between the emerging field and pre-existing
fields. That the remaining 20% do not show a close-by pre-existing field could
be explained by a lack of sensitivity or an unfavorable geometry of the
pre-existing field, for instance, a canopy-like structure. Transverse fields
occurred before the observation of the strong Doppler shifts. The process is
most naturally explained as the emergence of a granular-scale loop that first
gives rise to the linear polarization signals, interacts with pre-existing
fields (generating new neutral line configurations), and produces the observed
strong flows. This explanation is indicative of frequent small-scale
reconnection events in the quiet Sun.

central object in V4332 Sgr is now hidden in a dusty disc and that the
photospheric spectrum of this object observed in the optical results from
scattering of the radiation of the central star on dust grains in the
circumstellar matter. Recent polarimetric photometry has shown that the optical
radiation of the object is indeed strongly polarized. We present and analyse
our spectropolarimetric observations of V4332 Sgr obtained with the VLT in the
optical region. The optical continuum of V4332 Sgr is linearly polarized with a
typical degree of 16.6%. A clear depolarization is observed in the spectral
regions where emission features contribute significantly to the observed flux.
The only prominent exception is the CaI 6573 emission line, which is polarized
in 21%. The results of our spectropolarimetric observations are in accord with
the proposed geometry of the system and the advocated nature of the observed
optical spectrum of V4332 Sgr. The continuum is not seen directly but results
from scattering on dust within the disc and polar outflow, while most of the
gas emission comes from the polar outflow excited by the radiation field of the
central source. Additionally, the observed polarization patterns suggest a
stratification of the outflow.

theoretical models, it is especially important to get information from the
region close to the physical base of the jet, where the plasma acceleration
takes place. In this paper, we report multi-epoch and multi-frequency continuum
observations of the z=2.5 blazar PKS1830-211 with ALMA, serendipitously
coincident with a strong $\gamma$-ray flare reported by Fermi-LAT. The blazar
is lensed by a foreground z=0.89 galaxy, with two bright images of the compact
core separated by 1"". Our ALMA observations individually resolve these two
images (although not any of their substructures), and we study the change of
their relative flux ratio with time (four epochs spread over nearly three times
the time delay between the two lensed images) and frequency (between 350 and
1050 GHz, rest-frame of the blazar), during the $\gamma$-ray flare. In
particular, we detect a remarkable frequency-dependent behaviour of the flux
ratio, which implies the presence of a chromatic structure in the blazar (i.e.,
a core-shift effect). We rule out the possiblity of micro- and milli-lensing
effects and propose instead a simple model of plasmon ejection in the blazar's
jet to explain the time and frequency variability of the flux ratio. We suggest
that PKS1830-211 is likely one of the best sources to probe the activity at the
base of a blazar's jet at submillimeter wavelengths, thanks to the peculiar
geometry of the system. The implications of the core-shift in absorption
studies of the foreground z=0.89 galaxy (e.g., constraints on the cosmological

w_k\}\subseteq V(G)$ and a vertex $u\in V(G)$, the representation of $u$ with
respect to $W$ is the ordered $k$-tuple $(d(u,w_1), d(u,w_2),\dots,$
$d(u,w_k))$, where $d(u,w_i)$ denotes the distance between $u$ and $w_i$. The
set $W$ is a metric generator for $G$ if every two different vertices of $G$
have distinct representations. A minimum cardinality metric generator is called
a \emph{metric basis} of $G$ and its cardinality is called the \emph{metric
dimension} of G. It is well known that the problem of finding the metric
dimension of a graph is NP-Hard. In this paper we obtain closed formulae for
the metric dimension of graphs with cut vertices. The main results are applied
to specific constructions including rooted product graphs, corona product
graphs, block graphs and chains of graphs.

popular heuristic search consists of repeated application of branch exchange,

maintaining the radial structure of the network, until no load transfer can
further reduce the cost. Optimizing each branch exchange step is itself a mixed

optimizing a branch exchange step. It uses an AC power flow model and is based
on the recently developed convex relaxation of optimal power flow. We provide a

have been the base for re-conciliating the two neutralist and selectionist
schools on evolution.
  Here, we adapted the concept of genotype networks to the study of population
genetics data, applying them to the 1000 Genomes dataset. We used networks
composed of short haplotypes of Single Nucleotide Variants (SNV), and defined
phenotypes as the presence or absence of a haplotype in a human population. We
used coalescent simulations to determine if the number of samples in the 1000
Genomes dataset is large enough to represent the genetic variation of real
populations. The result is a scan of how properties related to the genetic
heterogeneity and stability to mutations are distributed along the human
genome. We found that genes involved in acquired immunity, such as some HLA and
MHC genes, tend to have the most heterogeneous and connected networks; and we
have also found that there is a small, but significant difference between
networks of coding regions and those of non-coding regions, suggesting that
coding regions are both richer in genotype diversity, and more stable to
mutations. Together, the work presented here may constitute a starting point
for applying genotype networks to study genome variation, as larger datasets of

instability threshold is investigated within the framework of the compact
Zakharov equation for unidirectional deep-water waves, recently derived by
Zakharov & Dyachenko (2011). Multiple-scale solutions reveal that a
perturbation to a slightly unstable uniform wavetrain of steepness \mu slowly
evolves according to a Nonlinear Schrodinger equation. In particular, for small
carrier wave steepness \mu<\mu_1~0.27 the perturbation dynamics is of focusing
type and the long-time behavior is characterized by Fermi-Pasta-Ulam
recurrence, the signature of breather interactions. However, the amplitude of
breathers and their likelihood of occurrence tend to diminish as \mu increases
while the Benjamin-Feir index decreases and becomes nil at \mu1. Thus,
homoclinic orbits persist only for small values of wave steepness \mu<<\mu_1,
in agreement with recent experimental and numerical observations of breathers.
When the Zakharov equation is already beyond its range of nominal validity for
\mu>\mu_1, predictions seem to foreshadow a dynamical trend to wave breaking.
In particular, the perturbation dynamics becomes of defocussing type, and
nonlinearities tend to stabilize a linearly unstable wavetrain as
Fermi-Pasta-Ulam recurrence is suppressed. At \mu=\mu_c~0.577, subharmonic
perturbations restabilize and superharmonic instability appears, possibly
indicating that wave dynamic behavior changes at large steepness, in
qualitative agreement with the numerical simulations of Longuet-Higgins and
Cokelet (1978) for steep waves. Indeed, for \mu>\mu_c a multiple-scale
perturbation analysis reveals that a weak narrowband perturbation to a uniform
wavetrain evolves in accord with a modified Korteweg-de Vries/Camassa-Holm type
equation, again implying a possible mechanism conducive to initiating wave
breaking.

Traditionally, RNA-seq experiments are mathematically averaged -- they sequence
the mRNA of individuals from different treatment groups, hoping to correlate
phenotype with differences in arithmetic read count averages at shared loci of
interest. Alternatively, the tissue from the same individuals may be pooled
prior to sequencing in what we refer to as a biologically averaged design. As
mathematical averaging sequences all individuals it controls for both
biological and technical variation; however, is the statistical resolution
gained always worth the additional cost? To compare biological and mathematical
averaging, we examined theoretical and empirical estimates of statistical
efficiency and relative cost efficiency. Though less efficient at a fixed
sample size, we found that biological averaging can be more cost efficient than
mathematical averaging. With this motivation, we developed a differential
expression classifier, ICRBC, that can detect alternatively expressed genes
between biologically averaged samples. In simulation studies, we found that
biological averaging and subsequent analysis with our classifier performed
comparably to existing methods, such as ASC, edgeR, and DESeq, especially when
individuals were pooled evenly and less than 20% of the regulome was expected
to be differentially regulated. In two technically distinct mouse datasets and
one plant dataset, we found that our method was over 87% concordant with edgeR
for the 100 most significant features. We therefore conclude biological
averaging may sufficiently control biological variation to a level that
differences in gene expression may be detectable. In such situations, ICRBC can
enable reliable exploratory analysis at a fraction of the cost, especially when
interest lies in the most differentially expressed loci.

have to withstand an about 3-5 times larger radiation environment at the future
high-luminosity LHC (HLLHC) compared to their design values. The preamplifier
and summing boards (PSBs), which are equipped with GaAs ASICs and comprise the
heart of the readout electronics, were irradiated with neutrons and protons
with fluences surpassing several times ten years of operation of the HL-LHC.
Neutron tests were performed at the NPI in Rez, Czech Republic, where a 36 MeV
proton beam was directed on a thick heavy water target to produce neutrons. The
proton irradiation was done with 200 MeV protons at the PROSCAN area of the
Proton Irradiation Facility at the PSI in Villigen, Switzerland. In-situ
measurements of S-parameters in both tests allow the evaluation of frequency
dependent performance parameters, like gain and input impedance, as a function
of fluence. The linearity of the ASIC response was measured directly in the
neutron tests with a triangular input pulse of varying amplitude. The results
obtained allow an estimation of the expected performance degradation of the
HEC. For a possible replacement of the PSB chips, alternative technologies were
investigated and exposed to similar neutron radiation levels. In particular,
IHP 250 nm Si CMOS technology has turned out to show good performance and match
the specifications required. The performance measurements of the current PSB
devices, the expected performance degradations under HL-LHC conditions, and
results from alternative technologies will be presented.

Israel matching conditions and their generalizations to higher codimensions,
the standard cornerstone of the braneworld and other membrane scenarios. Our
reasoning is twofold: First, the incapability of the conventional matching
conditions to accept the Nambu-Goto probe limit (even the geodesic limit of the
Israel matching conditions is not acceptable since being the geodesic equation
a kinematical fact it should be preserved for all gravitational theories or
defects, which is not the case for these conditions). Second, in our
D-dimensional spacetime (maybe D=4), classical defects of any possible
codimension should be compatible. These matching conditions fail to accept
codimension-2 and 3 defects for D=4 (which represents effectively the spacetime
at certain length and energy scales) and most probably fail to accept high
enough codimensional defects for any D since there is no high enough Lovelock
density to support them. Here, we propose alternative matching conditions which
seem to satisfy the previous criteria. Instead of varying the brane-bulk action
with respect to the bulk metric at the brane position, we vary with respect to
the brane embedding fields so that the gravitational back-reaction is included.
For a codimension-2 brane in 6-dim EGB gravity we prove its consistency for an
axially symmetric cosmological configuration. The cosmologies found have the
LFRW behaviour and extra correction terms. For a radiation brane one solution
avoids a cosmological singularity and undergoes accelerated expansion near the
minimum scale factor. In the presence of an induced gravity term, there
naturally appears in the theory the effective cosmological constant scale
lambda/(M_6^4 r_c^2), which for a brane tension lambda\sim M_6^4 (e.g. TeV^4)
and r_c \sim H_0^{-1} gives the observed value of the cosmological constant.

parameter $\alpha$. Firstly, we calculate the ""distance information"" of Planck
data which includes the ""shift parameter"" $R$, the ""acoustic scale"" $l_A$, and
the photon decoupling epoch $z_\ast$ in different cosmological models and find
that this information is almost independent on the input models we use. Then,
we compare the constraints on the free parameter $\alpha$ of the DGP model from
the ""distance information"" of Planck and WMAP data and find that the Planck
data with high precision do not improve the constraint on $\alpha$, but give
the higher median value and the better limit on the current matter density
fraction $\Omega_m$. Then, combining the ""distance information"" of Planck
measurement, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), type Ia supernovae (SNIa) and
the prior on the current Hubble constant (HST), we obtain the tight constraint
on the parameter $\alpha < 0.20$ at $95\%$ confidence level, which implies that
the flat DGP model has been ruled out by the current cosmological data.
Finally, we allow the additional parameter $\alpha < 0$ in our calculations and
interestingly obtain $\alpha=-0.29\pm0.20$ ($68\%$ C.L.), which means the
current data slightly favor the effective equation of state $w_{\rm eff}<-1$.
More importantly, the tension between constraints on $H_0$ from different

techniques used to detect surface differential rotation (hereafter DR) on
spotted stars. The disadvantage of a single cross-correlation is, however, that
the expected DR pattern can be overwhelmed by sudden changes in the apparent
spot configuration. Another way to reconstruct the image shear using Doppler
imaging is to include a predefined latitude-dependent rotation law in the
inversion code (`sheared image method'). However, special but not unusual spot
distributions, such like a large polar cap or an equatorial belt (e.g., small
random spots evenly distributed along the equator), can distort the rotation
profile similarly as the DR does, consequently, yielding incorrect measure of
the DR from the sheared image method. To avoid these problems, the technique of
measuring DR from averaged cross-correlations using time-series Doppler images
(`ACCORD') is introduced and the reliability of this tool is demonstrated on
artificial data.

processes on the real line. In particular, the compensator of a point process
uniquely determines and is determined by its distribution, and an explicit
formula involving conditional interarrival distributions is well-known. In two
dimensions there are many possible definitions of a point process compensator
and we focus here on the one that has been the most useful in practice: the
so-called *-compensator. Although existence of the *-compensator is well
understood, in general it does not determine the law of the point process and
it must be calculated on a case-by-case basis. However, it will be proven that
when the point process satisfies a certain property of conditional independence
(usually denoted by (F4)), the *- compensator determines the law of the point
process and an explicit regenerative formula can be given. The basic building
block of the planar model is the single line process (a point process with
incomparable jump points). Its law can be characterized by a class of avoidance
probabilities that are the two-dimensional counterpart of the survival function
in one dimension. Conditional avoidance probabilities then play the same role
in the construction of the *-compensator as conditional survival probabilities
do for compensators in one dimension.

red-giant stars in a 2-wheel Kepler Mission. Our main conclusion is that by
targeting stars in the ecliptic it should be possible to perform high-quality
asteroseismology, as long as favorable scenarios for 2-wheel pointing
performance are met. Targeting the ecliptic would potentially facilitate unique
science that was not possible in the nominal Mission, notably from the study of
clusters that are significantly brighter than those in the Kepler field. Our
conclusions are based on predictions of 2-wheel observations made by a space
photometry simulator, with information provided by the Kepler Project used as
input to describe the degraded pointing scenarios. We find that elevated levels
of frequency-dependent noise, consistent with the above scenarios, would have a
significant negative impact on our ability to continue asteroseismic studies of
solar-like oscillators in the Kepler field. However, the situation may be much
more optimistic for observations in the ecliptic, provided that pointing resets
of the spacecraft during regular desaturations of the two functioning reaction
wheels are accurate at the < 1 arcsec level. This would make it possible to
apply a post-hoc analysis that would recover most of the lost photometric
precision. Without this post-hoc correction---and the accurate re-pointing it
requires---the performance would probably be as poor as in the Kepler-field
case. Critical to our conclusions for both fields is the assumed level of
pointing noise (in the short-term jitter and the longer-term drift). We suggest
that further tests will be needed to clarify our results once more detail and
data on the expected pointing performance becomes available, and we offer our
assistance in this work.

noiseless transmitter confirmation (NTC). For IR-NTC systems based on {\em
finite-length} codes (with blocklength $N$) and decoding attempts only at {\em
certain specified decoding times}, this paper presents the asymptotic expansion
achieved by random coding, provides rate-compatible sphere-packing (RCSP)
performance approximations, and presents simulation results of tail-biting
convolutional codes.
  The information-theoretic analysis shows that values of $N$ relatively close
to the expected latency yield the same random-coding achievability expansion as
with $N = \infty$. However, the penalty introduced in the expansion by limiting
decoding times is linear in the interval between decoding times. For binary
symmetric channels, the RCSP approximation provides an efficiently-computed
approximation of performance that shows excellent agreement with a family of
rate-compatible, tail-biting convolutional codes in the short-latency regime.
For the additive white Gaussian noise channel, bounded-distance decoding
simplifies the computation of the marginal RCSP approximation and produces
similar results as analysis based on maximum-likelihood decoding for latencies
greater than 200. The efficiency of the marginal RCSP approximation facilitates
optimization of the lengths of incremental transmissions when the number of
incremental transmissions is constrained to be small or the length of the
incremental transmissions is constrained to be uniform after the first
transmission. Finally, an RCSP-based decoding error trajectory is introduced
that provides target error rates for the design of rate-compatible code
families for use in feedback communication systems.

Here, we establish an automatic method to estimate distances and reddening from
NIR photometry alone, without the use of isochrone fitting. We employ a
decontamination procedure of JHK photometry to determine the density of stars
foreground to clusters and a galactic model to estimate distances. We then
calibrate the method using clusters with known properties. This allows us to
establish distance estimates with better than 40% accuracy.
  We apply our method to determine the extinction and distance values to 378
known open clusters and 397 cluster candidates from the list of Froebrich,

of a distance of approximately 3kpc, with typical distances between 2 and 6kpc.
Using the cluster distances and extinction values, we investigate how the

virtual CPUs: (1) genetic flexibility: we allowed digital organisms to more
precisely modify the function of genetic instructions, (2) memory: we provided
an increased number of registers in the virtual CPUs, (3) decoupled sensors and

over data flow. We also tested a variety of methods to regulate expression: (4)
explicit labels that allow programs to dynamically refer to specific genome
positions, (5) position-relative search instructions, and (6) multiple new flow
control instructions, including conditionals and jumps. Each of these features
also adds complication to the instruction set and risks slowing evolution due
to epistatic interactions. Two features (multiple argument specification and
separated I/O) demonstrated substantial improvements int the majority of test
environments. Some of the remaining tested modifications were detrimental,

gauge bosons are generated by the interactions with the Higgs field, so all
couplings are related to the observed masses. Indeed, all observed couplings
are consistent with the predictions from the Higgs mechanism, both to vector
bosons and fermions implying that masses are indeed consistent of being
generated by the interactions with the Higgs field. However, on a cosmological
scale the mass of the universe seems not to be related to the Higgs field: the
baryonic mass originates from the binding energy of the quarks inside the
nuclei and dark matter is not even predicted in the SM, so the origin of its
mass is unknown. The dominant energy component in the universe, the dark
energy, yields an accelerated expansion of the universe, so its repulsive
gravity most likely originates from a kind of vacuum energy. The Higgs field
would be the prime candidate for this, if the energy density would not be many
orders of magnitude too high, as will be calculated. The Higgs mass is found to
be 125.7$\pm$0.3(stat.)$\pm$0.3(syst.) GeV, which is below 130 GeV, i.e. in the
range predicted by supersymmetry. This may be the strongest hint for
supersymmetry in spite of the fact that the predicted supersymmetric particles

boiling regime, in which they make direct contact with the surface and boil
violently, or a film boiling regime, in which they remain separated from the
surface by their own vapor. The transition from the contact to the film boiling
regime depends not only on the temperature of the surface and kinetic energy of
the droplet, but also on the size of the structures fabricated on the surface.
Here we experimentally show that surfaces covered with carbon-nanofibers delay
the transition to film boiling to much higher temperature compared to smooth
surfaces. We present physical arguments showing that, because of the small
scale of the carbon fibers, they are cooled by the vapor flow just before the
liquid impact, thus permitting contact boiling up to much higher temperatures
than on smooth surfaces. We also show that, as long as the impact is in the
film boiling regime, the spreading factor of impacting droplets follows the
same $\We^{3/10}$ scaling (with $\We$ the Weber number) found for smooth
surfaces, which is caused by the vapor flow underneath the droplet.

years. Most of the discussion has focused on theoretical issues with the
consequence that operational prescriptions, which are integral to experimental
physics, have been largely ignored. This has undoubtedly exacerbated attempts
to find a solution to the ""measurement problem"". In this paper, we fully
embrace the ensemble interpretation of quantum mechanics that obviates the need
to entertain reduction of the state vector, one of the primary dilemmas of the
measurement problem. The other major aspect of the measurement problem, the
necessity of describing measurements in terms of classical concepts, remains.
However, we argue that the ultimate interface with experiments is described by
operational prescriptions and not in terms of the concepts of classical theory.
The pedestrian approach presented here suggests that the measurement problem
is, in some sense, ill-posed and might never be resolved. This state of affairs
is, in part, the result of searching for a theoretical answer to what is
fundamentally an experimental question. This point of view is tenable so long
as one is willing to view physical theories as providing models of nature
rather than complete descriptions of reality. Among other things, these
considerations lead us to suggest that the Copenhagen interpretation's
insistence on the classicality of the measurement apparatus should be replaced
by the requirement that a measurement, which is specified operationally, should
simply be of sufficient precision.

momentum relaxation time and the Hartree-Fock effective magnetic field vary
with the scattering length in cold atoms, the anomalous Dyakonov-Perel'-like

Observatory sunspot group data since 2008. All sunspot groups (SGs) recorded
during this time interval were separated into two groups: The first group
includes small SGs [A, B, C, H, classes by the Zurich classification], and the
second group consists of large SGs [D, E, and F]. We then calculated small and
large sunspot group numbers, their sunspot numbers [SSN] and Zurich numbers
[Rz] from their daily mean numbers as observed on the solar disk during a given
month. We found that the temporal variations for these three different
separations behave similarly. We also analyzed the general shape of solar
cycles from Cycle 1 to 23 by using monthly International Sunspot Number [ISSN]
data and found that the durations of maxima were about 2.9 years. Finally, we
used ascending time and SSN relationship and found that the maximum of the
Cycle 24 should be later than 2011. Thus, we conclude that i) one possible
reason for a double maximum in solar cycles is the different behavior of large

formation is thought to be taking place. These objects feature characteristic
inner cavities and/or gaps of a few tens of AUs in the sub-millimitre images of
the disc. This signature suggests a localised depletion of matter in the disc
that could be caused by planet formation processes. However, recent
observations have revealed differences in the structures imaged at different
wavelengths in some of these discs. In this paper, we aim to explain these
observational differences using self-consistent physical 2-D hydrodynamical and
dust evolution models of such objects, assuming their morphology is indeed
generated by the presence of a planet. We use these models to derive the
distribution of gas and dust in a theoretical planet-hosting disc, for various
planet masses and orbital separations. We then simulate observations of the
emitted and scattered light from these models with VLT/SPHERE ZIMPOL,
Subaru/HiCIAO, VLT/VISIR and ALMA. We do this by first computing the full
resolution images of the models at different wavelengths, and then simulating
the observations accounting for the characteristics of each particular
instrument. The presence of the planet generates pressure bumps in the gas
distribution of the disc whose characteristics strongly depend on the planet
mass and position. These bumps cause large grains to accumulate while small
grains are allowed into inner regions. This spatial differentiation of the
grain sizes explains the differences in the observations since different
wavelengths and observing techniques trace different parts of the dust size
distribution. Based on this effect, we conclude that the combination of
visible/near-infrared polarimetric and sub-mm images is the best strategy to
constrain the properties of the unseen planet responsible for the disc
structure.

sample of randomly-oriented copies of a molecule. The problem of single
particle reconstruction (SPR) from cryo-EM is to use the resulting set of noisy
2D projection images taken at unknown directions to reconstruct the 3D
structure of the molecule. In some situations, the molecule under examination
exhibits structural variability, which poses a fundamental challenge in SPR.
The heterogeneity problem is the task of mapping the space of conformational
states of a molecule. It has been previously suggested that the leading
eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the 3D molecules can be used to solve
the heterogeneity problem. Estimating the covariance matrix is challenging,
since only projections of the molecules are observed, but not the molecules
themselves. In this paper, we formulate a general problem of covariance
estimation from noisy projections of samples. This problem has intimate
connections with matrix completion problems and high-dimensional principal
component analysis. We propose an estimator and prove its consistency. When
there are finitely many heterogeneity classes, the spectrum of the estimated
covariance matrix reveals the number of classes. The estimator can be found as
the solution to a certain linear system. In the cryo-EM case, the linear
operator to be inverted, which we term the projection covariance transform, is
an important object in covariance estimation for tomographic problems involving
structural variation. Inverting it involves applying a filter akin to the ramp
filter in tomography. We design a basis in which this linear operator is sparse
and thus can be tractably inverted despite its large size. We demonstrate via
numerical experiments on synthetic datasets the robustness of our algorithm to
high levels of noise.

materials by the Helium ions in the linear accelerator is conducted. The
experimental measurements techniques and data on the irradiation of the
functional design materials by the Helium ions with the energy up to 4 MeV,
including the detailed scheme of experimental measurements setup, are
presented. The new design of accelerating structure of the IH-type such as
POS-4, using the method of alternate-phase focusing with the step-by-step
change of the synchronous phase along the focusing periods in a linear
accelerator, is developed with the aim to irradiate the functional design
materials by the Helium ions. The new design of the injector of the charged
Helium ions with the energy of 120 KeV at the output of an accelerating tube
and the accelerating structure of the type of POS-4 for the one time charged
Helium ions acceleration in the linear accelerator are researched and
developed. The special chamber for the irradiation of functional design
materials by the Helium ions is also created. In the process of experiment, the
temperature of a sample, the magnitude of current of Helium ions beam and the
irradiation dose of sample are measured precisely. The experimental measurement
setup and techniques are fully tested and optimized in the course of the
research on the electro-physical properties of irradiated samples and the
thermal-desorption of Helium ions in a wide range of temperatures

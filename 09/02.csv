cells. Cells infected with virus strain $i\in\left\{1,...,n\right\}$ die at
per-capita rate $\delta_i(a)$ and produce virions at per-capita rate $p_i(a)$,
where $\delta_i(a)$ and $p_i(a)$ are functions of the age-since-infection of
the cell. Viral strain $i$ has a basic reproduction number, $\mathcal{R}_i$,

$\mathcal{R}_i>1$. If $\mathcal{R}_i<1$, then the total concentration of virus

states of the determining form. The second is that these steady states of the

measures and has proved effective for isolated outbreaks. However, the

become endemic in many regions of the world, can affect the implementation and
success of culling as a control measure. We use mathematical modeling to
understand the dynamics of avian influenza under different culling approaches.
We incorporate culling into an SI model by considering the per capita culling
rates to be general functions of the number of infected birds. Complex dynamics
of the system, such as backward bifurcation and forward hysteresis, along with
bi-stability, are detected and analyzed for two distinct culling scenarios. In
these cases, employing other control measures temporarily can drastically
change the dynamics of the solutions to a more favorable outcome for disease
control.

the appendix of a book by Andersen, Jantzen, and Soergel. Sara Billey
discovered it independently five years later, and it played a prominent role in
her work to evaluate certain polynomials closely related to Schubert
polynomials.
  Billey's formula relates many pieces of Schubert calculus: the geometry of
Schubert varieties, the action of the torus on the flag variety, combinatorial
data about permutations, the cohomology of the flag variety and of the Schubert
varieties, and the combinatorics of root systems (generalizing inversions of a
permutation). Combinatorially, Billey's formula describes an invariant of pairs
of elements of a Weyl group. On its face, this formula is a combination of
roots built from subwords of a fixed word. As we will see, it has deeper
geometric and topological meaning as well: (1) It tells us about the tangent
spaces at each permutation flag in each Schubert variety. (2) It tells us about
singular points in Schubert varieties. (3) It tells us about the values of
Kostant polynomials. Billey's formula also reflects an aspect of GKM theory,
which is a way of describing the torus-equivariant cohomology of a variety just
from information about the torus-fixed points in the variety.
  This paper will also describe some applications of Billey's formula,
including concrete combinatorial descriptions of Billey's formula in special
cases, and ways to bootstrap Billey's formula to describe the equivariant
cohomology of subvarieties of the flag variety to which GKM theory does not

Fermi gas with the dispersion modified by tunneling between the tubes, and show
that the T=0 phase diagram hosts the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO)
phase with non-zero center of mass momentum Cooper pairs for small values of
the SOC while for larger values of the SOC and high Zeeman fields the uniform
superfluid phase with zero center of mass momentum Cooper pairs has an
instability towards the topological uniform superfluid phase with Majorana
fermions at the tube ends. Also, we show that tuning the two-dimensional
optical lattice strength in this model allows one to explore the crossover
behaviors of the phases during the transition between the 3D and the 1D system
and in general the FFLO (for small SOC) and the topological uniform superfluid
phase (for large SOC) are favored as the system becomes more one-dimensional.
We also find evidence of the existence of a Zeeman tuned topological quantum
phase transition (TQPT) within the FFLO phase itself and for large values of
the Zeeman field and small SOC the TQPT gives rise to a topologically distinct
FFLO phase.

on streamed data. We discuss the problem of regression where the input variable
is a stream of information, and the dependent response is also (potentially) a
stream.
  A certain graded feature set of a stream, known in the rough path literature
as the signature, has a universality that allows formally, linear regression to
be used to characterise the functional relationship between independent
explanatory variables and the conditional distribution of the dependent
response.
  This approach, via linear regression on the signature of the stream, is
almost totally general, and yet it still allows explicit computation. The
grading allows truncation of the feature set and so leads to an efficient local
description for streams (rough paths). In the statistical context this method
offers potentially significant, even transformational dimension reduction.
  By way of illustration, our approach is applied to stationary time series
including the familiar AR model and ARCH model. In the numerical examples we
examined, our predictions achieve similar accuracy to the Gaussian Process (GP)

effectiveness and optimal deployment of pulse vaccination. In order to better
understand this control strategy, we propose a mathematical model accounting
for the disease dynamics in connected regions, incorporating seasonality,
environmental reservoirs and independent periodic pulse vaccination schedules
in each region. The effective reproduction number, $R_e$, is defined and proved
to be a global threshold for persistence of the disease. Analytical and
numerical calculations show the importance of synchronising the pulse
vaccinations in connected regions and the timing of the pulses with respect to
the pathogen circulation seasonality. Our results indicate that it may be
crucial for mass-vaccination programs, such as national immunisation days, to
be synchronised across different regions. In addition, simulations show that a
migration imbalance can increase $R_e$ and alter how pulse vaccination should
be optimally distributed among the patches, similar to results found with
constant-rate vaccination. Furthermore, contrary to the case of constant-rate
vaccination, the fraction of environmental transmission affects the value of
$R_e$ when pulse vaccination is present.

constants are unknown. Structural Kinetic Modelling (SKM) replaces reaction
elasticities by independent random numbers. Here I propose a variant that
accounts for reversible reactions and thermodynamics: in Structural
Thermokinetic Modelling (STM), correlated elasticities are computed from enzyme
saturation values and thermodynamic forces, which are physically independent.
STM relies on a dependency schema in which basic variables can be sampled,
fitted to data, or optimised, while all other variables are computed from them.
Probability distributions in the dependency schema define a model ensemble,
which leads to probabilistic predictions even if data are scarce. STM
highlights the importance of variabilities, dependencies and covariances of
biological variables. By choosing or sampling the basic variables, we can
convert metabolic networks into kinetic models with consistent reversible rate
laws. Metabolic control coefficients obtained from these models can tell us
about metabolic dynamics, including responses and optimal adaptations to
perturbations as well as enzyme synergies, metabolite correlations, and
metabolic fluctuations arising from chemical noise. By comparing model variants
with different network structures, fluxes, thermodynamic forces, regulation, or
types of rate laws, we can quantify the effects of these model features. To
showcase STM, I study metabolic control, metabolic fluctuations, and enzyme
synergies, and how they are shaped by thermodynamic forces. Thermodynamics can
be used to obtain more precise predictions of flux control, enzyme synergies,
correlated flux and metabolite variations, and of the emergence and propagation
of metabolic noise.

mystery. Here we describe explicitly a leaf-shaped convex region $\Lambda$
contained in $\Omega$ and occupying a good portion of $P$. The sets $\Omega_T$
and $\Omega_L$ of translational packing and covering densities and lattice
packing and covering densities are defined similarly, restricting the allowed
arrangements of $K$ to translated copies or lattice arrangements, respectively.
Due to affine invariance of the translative and lattice density functions, the

$\Omega_T$ and $\Omega_L$ contain the subsets $\Omega^\star$, $\Omega_T^\star$

spin axis, the Lense-Thirring effect causes it to precess at a rate declining
sharply with radius. Ever since the work of Bardeen & Petterson (1975), it has
been expected that when a fluid fills an orbiting disk, the orbital angular
momentum at small radii should then align with the mass's spin. Nearly all
previous work has studied this alignment under the assumption that a
phenomenological ""viscosity"" isotropically degrades fluid shears in accretion
disks, even though it is now understood that internal stress in flat disks is
due to anisotropic MHD turbulence. In this paper we report a pair of matched
simulations, one in MHD and one in pure (non-viscous) HD in order to clarify
the specific mechanisms of alignment. As in the previous work, we find that
disk warps induce radial flows that mix angular momentum of different
orientation; however, we also show that the speeds of these flows are
generically transonic and are only very weakly influenced by internal stresses
other than pressure. In particular, MHD turbulence does not act in a manner
consistent with an isotropic viscosity. When MHD effects are present, the disk
aligns, first at small radii and then at large; alignment is only partial in
the HD case. We identify the specific angular momentum transport mechanisms
causing alignment and show how MHD effects permit them to operate more
efficiently. Lastly, we relate the speed at which an alignment front propagates
outward (in the MHD case) to the rate at which Lense-Thirring torques deliver
angular momentum at smaller radii.

effects. An electrostatic energy term in the Hamiltonian appears when such OAM
and crystal momentum dependent asymmetric charge distribution is placed in an
electric field produced from an inversion symmetry breaking (ISB). Analysis by
using an effective Hamiltonian shows that, as the atomic spin-orbit coupling
(SOC) strength increases from weak to strong, originally OAM-quenched states
evolve into well-defined chiral OAM states and then to total angular momentum
J-states. In addition, the energy scale of the band splitting changes from
atomic SOC energy to electrostatic energy. To confirm the validity of the
model, we study OAM and spin structures of Au(111) system by using an effective
Hamiltonian for the d-orbitals case. As for strong SOC regime, we choose
Bi2Te2Se as a prototype system. We performed circular dichroism angle resolved

The most massive clusters in the
Milky Way exist in two groups - loose and compact clusters - with significantly
different sizes at the end of the star formation process. After their formation
both types of clusters expand up to a factor 10-20 within the first 20 Myr. Gas
expulsion at the end of the star formation process is usually regarded as only
possible process that can lead to such an expansion.We investigate the effect
of gas expulsion by a direct comparison between numerical models and observed
clusters concentrating on clusters with masses >10^3 M(sun). For these clusters
the initial conditions before gas expulsion, the characteristic cluster
development, its dependence on cluster mass, and the star formation efficiency
(SFE) are investigated. We perform N-body simulations of the cluster expansion
process after gas expulsion and compare the results with observations. We find
that the expansion processes of the observed loose and compact massive clusters
are driven by completely different physical processes. As expected the
expansion of loose massive clusters is largely driven by the gas loss due to
the low SFE of ~30%. One new revelation is that all the observed massive
clusters of this group seem to have a very similar size of 1-3 pc at the onset
of expansion. It is demonstrated that compact clusters have a much higher
effective SFE of 60-70% and are as a result much less affected by gas
expulsion. Their expansion is mainly driven by stellar ejections caused by
interactions between the cluster members. The reason why ejections are so
efficient in driving cluster expansion is that they occur dominantly from the
cluster centre and over an extended period of time. Thus during the first 10
Myr the internal dynamics of loose and compact clusters differ fundamentally.

has always been an important but elusive research goal, since the packet degree
distribution, which is the main factor driving the complexity, is altered in a
non-deterministic way by the random recombinations at the network nodes. In
this paper we tackle this problem proposing Band Codes (BC), a novel class of
network codes specifically designed to preserve the packet degree distribution
during packet encoding, ecombination and decoding. BC are random codes over
GF(2) that exhibit low decoding complexity, feature limited and controlled
degree distribution by construction, and hence allow to effectively apply NC
even in energy-constrained scenarios. In particular, in this paper we motivate
and describe our new design and provide a thorough analysis of its performance.
We provide numerical simulations of the performance of BC in order to validate
the analysis and assess the overhead of BC with respect to a onventional NC
scheme. Moreover, peer-to-peer media streaming experiments with a random-push
protocol show that BC reduce the decoding complexity by a factor of two, to a
point where NC-based mobile streaming to mobile devices becomes practically
feasible.

(CE) phase. Although this phase is believed to be responsible for the formation
of many close binaries, the process is not well understood. Aims. We
investigate the characteristics of the population of post-common-envelope
binaries (PCEB). As the evolution of these binaries and their stellar
components are relatively simple, this population can be directly used to
constraint CE evolution. Methods. We use the binary population synthesis code
SeBa to simulate the current-day population of PCEBs in the Galaxy. We
incorporate the selection effects in our model that are inherent to the general
PCEB population and that are specific to the SDSS survey, which enables a
direct comparison for the first time between the synthetic and observed
population of visible PCEBs. Results. We find that selection effects do not
play a significant role on the period distribution of visible PCEBs. To explain
the observed dearth of long-period systems, the {\alpha}-CE efficiency of the
main evolutionary channel must be low. In the main channel, the CE is initiated
by a red giant as it fills its Roche lobe in a dynamically unstable way. Other
evolutionary paths cannot be constrained more. Additionally our model
reproduces well the observed space density, the fraction of visible PCEBs
amongst white dwarf (WD)- main sequence (MS) binaries, and the WD mass versus
MS mass distribution, but overestimates the fraction of PCEBs with helium WD
companions.

exploring a new or innovative move decreases as a power law with the frequency

sequences according to their frequencies, following a preferential growth

similarities with the process of vocabulary growth. We propose a robust

Richtmyer-Meshkov (RM) instability reveals new and potentially very useful
effects. We find that, in contrast with the non- relativistic case, the growth
rate of the RM instability depends strongly on the equation of state of the
fluid, opening up the possibility to infer equations of state from experimental
observations of the RM instability. As opposed to the non-relativistic case, we
also discover that, above a critical value of the fluid velocity, the growth
rate of the instability counter-intuitively decreases due to the Lorentz's
factor, and vanishes in the ultrarelativistic limit, as the speed of the
particles approaches the speed of light. Both effects might prove very useful
for leading-edge applications, such as the study of the equation of state of
quark-gluon matter, and the design of fast ignition inertial confinement fusion
(ICF) schemes. We perform a linear stability analysis to characterize the
instability, for an arbitrary equation of state, and implement numerical
simulations to study the instability in the non-linear regime, using the
equation of state of an ideal gas. Furthermore, based on the numerical results,
we propose a general expression that characterizes the long term evolution of
the instability.

sustainably than it did in 1992. The data indicate furthermore that the
environmental impacts from our current economic activities are so large, that
we are approaching situations where potentially controllable regional problems
can easily lead to uncontrollable global disasters.
  Assuming that (1) the majority of the human family, once adequately informed,
wants to achieve a ""sustainable way of life"" and (2) that the ""development
towards sustainability"" roadmap will be based on scientific principles, one
must begin with unambiguous and quantifiable definitions of these goals. As
will be demonstrated, the well known scientific method to define abstract and
complex issues by their negation, satisfies these requirements. Following this
new approach, it also becomes possible to decide if proposed and actual
policies changes will make our way of life less unsustainable, and thus move us
potentially into the direction of sustainability. Furthermore, if potentially
dangerous tipping points are to be avoided, the transition roadmap must include
some minimal speed requirements. Combining the negation method and the time
evolution of that remaining natural capital in different domains, the
transition speed for a ""development towards sustainability"" can be quantified
at local, regional and global scales.
  The presented ideas allow us to measure the rate of natural capital depletion
and the rate of restoration that will be required if humanity is to avoid
reaching a sustainable future by a collapse transition.

  minor corrections",,,,"math.CV math.AG math.DG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This article deals with two topics: the first, which has a general character,
is a variation formula for the the determinant line bundle in non-K\""ahlerian
geometry. This formula, which is a consequence of the non-K\""ahlerian version
of the Grothendieck-Riemann Roch theorem proved recently by Bismut, gives the
variation of the determinant line bundle corresponding to a perturbation of a
Fourier-Mukai kernel ${\cal E}$ on a product $B\times X$ by a unitary flat line
bundle on the fiber $X$. When this fiber is a complex surface and ${\cal E}$ is
a holomorphic 2-bundle, the result can be interpreted as a Donaldson invariant.
  The second topic concerns a geometric application of our variation formula,
namely we will study compact complex subspaces of the moduli spaces of stable
bundles considered in our program for proving existence of curves on minimal
class VII surfaces. Such a moduli space comes with a distinguished point
$a=[{\cal A}]$ corresponding to the canonical extension ${\cal A}$ of $X$. The
compact subspaces $Y\subset {\cal M}^\st$ containing this distinguished point
play an important role in our program. We will prove a non-existence result:
there exists no compact complex subspace of positive dimension $Y\subset {\cal
M}^\st$ containing $a$ with an open neighborhood $a\in Y_a\subset Y$ such that
$Y_a\setminus\{a\}$ consists only of non-filtrable bundles. In other words,
within any compact complex subspace of positive dimension $Y\subset {\cal
M}^\st$ containing $a$, the point $a$ can be approached by filtrable bundles.
Specializing to the case $b_2=2$ we obtain a new way to complete the proof of a
theorem in a previous article: any minimal class VII surface with $b_2=2$ has a
cycle of curves. Applications to class VII surfaces with higher $b_2$ will be
be discussed in a forthcoming article.

studied incorporating either holonomy corrections, where the Ashtekar

well-defined quantum analogue, or inverse-volume corrections coming from the
eigenvalues of the inverse-volume operator.
  In this paper we will develop an alternative approach to calculate
cosmological perturbations in LQC based on the fact that, holonomy corrected
LQC in the flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) geometry could be
also obtained as a particular case of teleparallel $F(T)$ gravity (teleparallel
LQC). The main idea of our approach is to mix the simple bounce provided by
holonomy corrections in LQC with the non-singular perturbation equations given
by $F(T)$ gravity, in order to obtain a matter bounce scenario as a viable
alternative to slow-roll inflation.
  In our study, we have obtained an scale invariant power spectrum of
cosmological perturbations. However, the ratio of tensor to scalar
perturbations is of order $1$, which does not agree with the current
observations. For this reason, we suggest a model where a transition from the
matter domination to a quasi de Sitter phase is produced in order to enhance
the scalar power spectrum.

for the detection of a Na layer in the earthshine, other atomic species are not

the difficult telluric corrections. The Na layer is found to vary between

suppressing star-formation activity in massive elliptical galaxies at late
times. As such the cosmic evolution of these sources is vitally important to
understanding the significance of such AGN feedback processes and their
influence on the global star-formation history of the universe. In this paper
we present a new investigation of the evolution of faint radio sources out to
$z{\sim}2.5$. We combine a 1 square degree VLA radio survey, complete to a
depth of 100 $\mu$Jy, with accurate 10 band photometric redshifts from the
VIDEO and CFHTLS surveys. The results indicate that the radio population
experiences mild positive evolution out to $z{\sim}1.2$ increasing their space
density by a factor of $\sim$3, consistent with results of several previous
studies. Beyond $z$=1.2 there is evidence of a slowing down of this evolution.
Star-forming galaxies drive the more rapid evolution at low redshifts,
$z{<}$1.2, while more slowly evolving AGN populations dominate at higher
redshifts resulting in a decline in the evolution of the radio luminosity
function at $z{>}$1.2. The evolution is best fit by pure luminosity evolution
with star-forming galaxies evolving as $(1+z)^{2.47\pm0.12}$ and AGN as
$(1+z)^{1.18\pm0.21}$.

collapse and/or explosion. Spinning down over a time of 0-10 Gyr brings the WD
to explosion. A very long delayed explosion to post-crystallization phase,
which lasts for about 2 Gyr leads to the formation of a highly carbon-enriched
outer layer. This can account for the carbon-rich composition of the
fastest-moving ejecta of SN 2011fe. In reaching the conclusion that the CD
scenario best explains the observed properties of SN 2011fe we consider both
its specific properties, like a very compact exploding object and carbon rich
composition of the fastest-moving ejecta, and the general properties of SNe Ia.

localized energy transport processes. In the solar atmosphere strongly
structured by gravitational and magnetic forces, we launch a localized velocity
pulse (in horizontal and vertical components) within a bottom layer of 3D solar
atmosphere modelled by initial VAL-IIIC conditions, which triggers waves and
vortices. The rotation direction of vortices depends on the orientation of an
initial perturbation. The vertical driver generates magnetoacoustic-gravity
waves which result in oscillations of the transition region, and it leads to
the eddies with their symmetry axis oriented vertically. The horizontal pulse
excites all magnetohydrodynamic-gravity waves and horizontally oriented eddies.
These waves propagate upwards, penetrate the transition region, and enter the
solar corona. In the high-beta plasma regions the magnetic field lines move
with the plasma and the temporal evolution show that they swirl with eddies. We
estimate the energy fluxes carried out by the waves in the magnetized solar
atmosphere and conclude that such wave dynamics and vortices may be significant
in transporting the energy to sufficiently balance the energy losses in the
localized corona. Moreover, the structure of the transition region highly
affects such energy transports, and causes the channelling of the propagating

data with IRAS, the angular auto- and cross frequency power spectrum is
measured from 143 to 3000 GHz, and the auto-bispectrum from 217 to 545 GHz. The
total areas used to compute the CIB power spectrum and bispectrum are about
2240 and 4400 deg^2, respectively. After careful removal of the contaminants,
and a complete study of systematics, the CIB power spectrum and bispectrum are
measured with unprecedented signal to noise ratio from angular multipoles
ell~150 to 2500, and ell~130 to 1100, respectively. Two approaches are
developed for modelling CIB power spectrum anisotropies. The first approach
takes advantage of the unique measurements by Planck at large angular scales,
and models only the linear part of the power spectrum, with a mean bias of dark
matter halos hosting dusty galaxies at a given redshift weighted by their
contribution to the emissivities. The second approach is based on a model that
associates star-forming galaxies with dark matter halos and their subhalos,
using a parametrized relation between the dust-processed infrared luminosity
and (sub-)halo mass. The two approaches simultaneously fit all auto- and cross-
power spectra very well. We find that the star formation history is well
constrained up to z~2. However, at higher redshift, the accuracy of the star
formation history measurement is strongly degraded by the uncertainty in the
spectral energy distribution of CIB galaxies. We also find that CIB galaxies
have warmer temperatures as redshift increases. The CIB bispectrum is steeper
than that expected from the power spectrum, although well fitted by a power
law; this gives some information about the contribution of massive halos to the
CIB bispectrum.

which chiral multiplets of baryon fields are Pauli-allowed, and which are not.
In a previous paper we have investigated the Fierz identities of baryon fields
with two light flavours and found that all bilocal fields that can be
constructed from three quarks are Pauli-allowed. That does not mean that all
possible chiral multiplets exist, however: some chiral multiplets do not appear
among structures with a given spin in the local limit, say J = 1/2. One such
chiral multiplet is the [(6,3)+(3,6)], which is necessary for a successful
chiral mixing phenomenology. In the present paper we extend those methods to
three light flavors, i.e. to SU_F(3) symmetry and explicitly construct all
three necessary chiral SU_L(3)*SU_R(3) multiplets, viz. [(6,3)+(3,6)],
[(3,3_bar)+(3_bar,3)] and [(3_bar,3)+(3,3_bar)] that are necessary for a
phenomenologically successful chiral mixing. We complete this analysis by
considering some bi-local baryon fields that are sufficient for the
construction of the ""missing"" spin 1/2 baryon interpolating fields. Bi-local
baryon fields have definite total angular momentum only in the local limit. The
physical significance of these results lies in the fact that they show that
there is no need for higher Fock space components, such as the (q^4 q_bar), in
the baryon chiral mixing framework, for the purpose of fitting the observed
axial couplings and magnetic moments: all of the sufficient ""mirror components""

that the whole power spectrum shifts to high (low) frequencies as the source

in January 2012. The goal was to explain a proof of a famous theorem by P.
Deligne about coherent topoi (coherent topoi have enough points) and to show
how this theorem is equivalent to G\""odel's completeness theorem for first
order logic. Because it was not possible to cover everything in only three
hours, the focus was on Barr's and Deligne's theorems. This explains why the
corresponding sections have been given more attention. Section 1 and the
Appendix were added in an attempt to make this document self-contained and
understandable by a reader with a good knowledge of topos theory.
  A coherent topos is a topos which is equivalent to a Grothendieck topos that
admits a site $(C,J)$ such that $C$ has finite limits and there exists a base
of $J$ with finite covering families. In order to prove that any coherent topos
has enough points, it is enough to show that for any coherent topos
$\mathcal{E}$ there is a surjective geometric morphism from a topos with enough
points to $\mathcal{E}$. As sheaf topoi over topological spaces have enough
points, any surjective geometric morphism from some $Sh(X)$, with $X$ a
topological space, to $\mathcal{E}$ is sufficient. These are provided by Barr's
theorem. This is the approach that will be taken here (following MacLane and
Moerdijk, Sheaves in Geometry and Logic).

studying the plasma behaviour in astrophysical scenarios and in heavy-ion
collision. They can produce conical emission in relativistic collisions and are
also thought to be the mechanism behind the acceleration of energetic particles
in active galactic nuclei and gamma ray bursts. The shocks are mostly
hydrodynamic shocks. In a magnetic background they become magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) shocks. For that reason we study the space-like and time-like shock
discontinuity in a magnetic plasma. The shocks induce a phase transition in the
plasma, here assuming a transition from hadron to quarks. The MHD conservation
conditions are derived across the shock. The conservation conditions are solved
for downstream velocities and flow angles for given upstream variables. The
shock conditions are solved at different baryon densities. For the space-like
shocks the anisotropy in the downstream velocity arises due to the magnetic
field. The downstream velocity vector always points downward with respect to
the shock normal. With the increase in density the anisotropy is somewhat
reduced. The magnetic field has effectively no effect on time-like shocks. The
slight anisotropy in the downstream flow velocities is caused by the boosting
that brings the quantities from the fluid frame to normal incidence (NI) frame.

preferred foliation, with a price of introducing a puzzling concept of
spacetime probability conserved in a scalar time. We explain how analogous
concept appears naturally in classical statistical mechanics of relativistic
particles, with scalar time being identified with the proper time along
particle trajectories. The conceptual understanding of relativistic Bohmian
mechanics is significantly enriched by this classical insight. In particular,
the analogy between classical and Bohmian mechanics suggests the interpretation
of Bohmian scalar time as a quantum proper time different from the classical
one, the two being related by a nonlocal scale factor calculated from the wave
function. In many cases of practical interest, including the macroscopic
measuring apparatus, the fundamental spacetime probability explains the more
familiar space probability as an emergent approximate description. Requiring
that the quantum proper time in the classical limit should reduce to the
classical proper time, we propose that only massive particles have Bohmian
trajectories. An analysis of the macroscopic measuring apparatus made up of
massive particles restores agreement with the predictions of standard quantum
theory.

positive with increase of magnetic field. The result apparently contradicts to
existing theories. To explain experimental data we suggest that clusters of
overlapping quantum dots are formed. These clusters are assumed to have
metal-like conductance, the charge transfer taking place via hopping between
the clusters. Relatively strong magnetic field shrinks electron wave functions
decreasing inter-cluster hopping and, therefore, leading to a positive
magnetoresistance. Weak magnetic field acts on ""metallic"" clusters destroying
interference of electron wave function corresponding to different paths (weak
localization) inside clusters. The interference may be restricted either by
inelastic processes, or by the cluster size. Taking into account WL inside
clusters and hopping between them within the effective medium approximation we
extract effective parameters characterizing charge (magneto) transport.

an ideal of a commutative Noetherian ring (cf. \cite{ANV}), and
  Bass numbers of local cohomology modules.
  Let $R$ denote a commutative Noetherian local ring and $I$ an ideal of $R$.
We first show that the Bass numbers $\mu^0(\frak p, H^2_I(R))$ and $\mu^1(\frak
p, H^2_I(R))$ are finite for all $\frak p\in \Spec R$, whenever $R$ is regular.
As a consequence, it follows that the Goldie dimension of $H^2_I(R)$ is finite.
Also, for a finitely generated $R$-module $M$ of dimension $d$, it is shown
that the Bass numbers of $H^{d-1}_{I}(M)$ are finite if and only if
$\Ext^i_R(R/I, H^{d-1}_{I}(M))$ be minimax for all $i\geq0$. Finally, we prove
that if $\dim R/I=2$, then the Bass numbers of $H^{n}_{I}(M)$ are finite if and

few compact (~ 5 arcsec) bullets while the lowest velocity gas traces the wall
of the gas cavity excavated by the shock expansion. A large velocity gradient
model applied to the CS (3-2) and (2-1) lines provides an upper limit of 10^6

is still uncertain: they could be the result of local instabilities produced by
the interaction of the jet with the ambient medium or could be clump already
present in the ambient medium that are excited and accelerated by the expanding
outflow. The column densities of the observed species can be reproduced
qualitatively by the presence in B1 of a C-type shock and only models where the

energy density functional (EDF) method. As such, it does not aim at reviewing
the status of the field, at covering all possible ramifications of the approach
or at presenting recent achievements and applications. The objective is to
provide a modern account of the nuclear EDF formalism that is at variance with
traditional presentations that rely, at one point or another, on a {\it
Hamiltonian-based} picture. The latter is not general enough to encompass what
the nuclear EDF method represents as of today. Specifically, the traditional
Hamiltonian-based picture does not allow one to grasp the difficulties
associated with the fact that currently available parametrizations of the
energy kernel $E[g',g]$ at play in the method do not derive from a genuine
Hamilton operator, would the latter be effective. The method is formulated from
the outset through the most general multi-reference, i.e. beyond mean-field,
implementation such that the single-reference, i.e. ""mean-field"", derives as a
particular case. As such, a key point of the presentation provided here is to
demonstrate that the multi-reference EDF method can indeed be formulated in a
{\it mathematically} meaningful fashion even if $E[g',g]$ does {\it not} derive
from a genuine Hamilton operator. In particular, the restoration of symmetries
can be entirely formulated without making {\it any} reference to a projected
state, i.e. within a genuine EDF framework. However, and as is illustrated in
the present document, a mathematically meaningful formulation does not
guarantee that the formalism is sound from a {\it physical} standpoint. The
price at which the latter can be enforced as well in the future is eventually
alluded to.

discuss the componentization of the functional level, the synthesis of an

level conforms to properties such as deadlock-freedom. We also show through
experimentation that the verification is feasible and usable for complex, real
world robotic systems, and that the BIP-based functional levels resulting from
our new methodology are, despite an overhead during execution, still practical
on real world robotic platforms. Our approach has been fully implemented in the

molecule (nu_7, 2nu_7, 3nu_7, nu_6, nu_5, and nu_6+nu_7) and 35 rotational
lines of the ground state of HC5N. We report the first tentative detection of

our results for HC3N with those in other clouds allows us to derive
correlations between the column density, the FWHM, the mass, and the luminosity
of the clouds. The high column densities of HC3N obtained in the hot core, make
this molecule an excellent tracer of hot and dense gas. In addition, the large
frequency range covered reveals the need to consider a temperature and density
gradient in the hot core in order to obtain better line fits. The high D/H
ratio (comparable to that obtained in cold clouds) that we derive suggests a
deuterium enrichment. Our chemical models indicate that the possible deuterated
HC3N present in Orion KL is formed during the gas-phase. This fact provides new
hints concerning the processes leading to deuteration.

receiver via an additive white Gaussian noise asynchronous multiple-access
channel. Transmission makes use of a perfect causal feedback link to the
encoder connected to each sensor. A retransmission protocol inspired by the
classical scheme in [1] applied to the transmission of single and bi-variate
analog samples analyzed in [2] and [3] is extended to the more general network
scenario, for which asymptotic upper-bounds on the reconstruction error are
provided. Both the upper and lower-bounds show that collaboration can be
achieved through energy accumulation under certain circumstances. In order to
investigate the practical performance of the proposed retransmission protocol
we provide a numerical evaluation of the upper-bounds in the non-asymptotic
energy regime using low-order quantization in the sensors. The latter includes
a minor modification of the protocol to improve reconstruction fidelity.
Numerical results show that an increase in the size of the network brings
benefit in terms of performance, but that the gain in terms of energy
efficiency diminishes quickly at finite energies due to a non-coherent
combining loss.

reflect the best object performance expected from the future ATLAS and CMS
experiments; this is referred to as the ""Combined Snowmass Detector"". We
perform simulations of $pp$ interactions at center-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s}=$
14, 33, and 100 TeV with 0, 50, and 140 additional $pp$ pile-up interactions.
The object performance with multi-TeV $pp$ collisions are studied for the first
time using large pile-up interactions.

  by a hybrid discrete cuckoo search algorithm",,,,,"math.OC cs.DS cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This article considers the parallel machine scheduling problem with
step-deteriorating jobs and sequence-dependent setup times. The objective is to
minimize the total tardiness by determining the allocation and sequence of jobs
on identical parallel machines. In this problem, the processing time of each
job is a step function dependent upon its starting time. An individual extended
time is penalized when the starting time of a job is later than a specific
deterioration date. The possibility of deterioration of a job makes the
parallel machine scheduling problem more challenging than ordinary ones. A
mixed integer programming model for the optimal solution is derived. Due to its
NP-hard nature, a hybrid discrete cuckoo search algorithm is proposed to solve
this problem. In order to generate a good initial swarm, a modified heuristic
named the MBHG is incorporated into the initialization of population. Several
discrete operators are proposed in the random walk of L\'{e}vy Flights and the
crossover search. Moreover, a local search procedure based on variable
neighborhood descent is integrated into the algorithm as a hybrid strategy in
order to improve the quality of elite solutions. Computational experiments are
executed on two sets of randomly generated test instances. The results show
that the proposed hybrid algorithm can yield better solutions in comparison
with the commercial solver CPLEX with one hour time limit, discrete cuckoo
search algorithm and the existing variable neighborhood search algorithm.

behavior of a combinational network, are not yet fully understood. In this
paper, we show that there exists a large class of Boolean functions, called
root functions, which can never appear as faulty response in irredundant
two-level circuits even when any arbitrary multiple stuck-at faults are
injected. Conversely, we show that any other Boolean function can appear as a
faulty response from an irredundant realization of some root function under
certain stuck-at faults. We characterize this new class of functions and show
that for n variables, their number is exactly equal to the number of
independent dominating sets (Harary and Livingston, Appl. Math. Lett., 1993) in
a Boolean n-cube. We report some bounds and enumerate the total number of root
functions up to 6 variables. Finally, we point out several open problems and
possible applications of root functions in logic design and testing.

processes with the information technology field, whereas the programming of
data processing systems evolved into standardized routines and packages of
enterprise resource planning software. The main objective of this paper is to
reduce the effort of Administrator to keep the daily events such as attendance,
projects, works, appointments, etc. This paper deals with the process of
identifying the employees, recording their attendance hourly and calculating
their effective payable hours or days. This paper should maintain the records
of each and every employee and their time spend in to company, which can be
used for performance appraisal. Based on that transfer, removal, promotion can
be done.

by solving the non-relativistic radial wave equation using the internal energy
potential. The QGP matter is studied through the dissociations of quarkonium
systems. A modified form of the internal energy potential function is used to
determine the EoS at different number of quark flavors by using Mayer s cluster
expansion theory and phenomenological thermodynamic model. The thermodynamic
model gives a good agreement with the lattice results rather than Mayer s
cluster expansion theory. One can conclude that, the Mayer s cluster expansion
theory may be more suitable to study a weakly coupled plasma while, the QGP may
be considered as a strongly interacting plasma.

Further, ratios of the total cross sections of the studied nuclei with respect

(RIP) as a sufficient condition for measurement matrix which guarantees the
recovery of any sparse signal from its compressed measurements. The RIP
condition also preserves enough information for classification of sparse
symbols, even with fewer measurements. In this work, we utilize RIP bound as
the cost function for training a simple neural network in order to exploit the
near optimal measurements or equivalently near optimal features for
classification of a known set of sparse symbols. As an example, we consider
demodulation of pulse position modulation (PPM) signals. The results indicate
that the proposed method has much better performance than the random
measurements and requires less samples than the optimum matched filter
demodulator, at the expense of some performance loss. Further, the proposed
approach does not need equalizer for multipath channels in contrast to the
conventional receiver.

algebraic geometry. We define derived n-shifted quadratic complexes, over
derived affine stacks and over general derived stacks, and give several
examples of those. We define the associated notion of derived Clifford algebra,
in all these contexts, and compare it with its classical version, when they
both apply. Finally, we prove three main existence results for derived shifted
quadratic forms over derived stacks, define a derived version of the
Grothendieck-Witt group of a derived stack, and compare it to the classical
one.

relativistic A+A collisions is altered significantly by the presence of sharp
inhomogeneities in superdense matter formed in such processes. The causality
constraints enforce one to associate the long-range longitudinal correlations
observed in a narrow angular interval, the so-called (soft) ridge, with
peculiarities of the initial conditions of collision process. This study's
objective is to analyze whether multiform initial tubular structures,
undergoing the subsequent hydrodynamic evolution and gradual decoupling, can
form the soft ridges. Motivated by the flux-tube scenarios, the initial energy
density distribution contains the different numbers of high density tube-like
boost-invariant inclusions that form a bumpy structure in the transverse plane.
The influence of various structures of such initial conditions in the most
central A+A events on the collective evolution of matter, resulting spectra,
angular particle correlations and v_n-coefficients is studied in the framework
of the HydroKinetic Model (HKM).

Survey (SDSS), which is verified to be efficient by calculating precision and
recall. From nearly two million spectra including stars, galaxies and QSOs, we
have found 260 new carbon stars in which 96 stars have been identified as
dwarfs and 7 identified as giants, and 11 composition spectrum systems (each of
them consists of a white dwarf and a carbon star). Similarly, using the label
propagation method, we have obtained 29 new DZ white dwarfs from SDSS DR8.
Compared with PCA reconstructed spectra, the 29 findings are typical DZ white
dwarfs. We have also investigated their proper motions by comparing them with
proper motion distribution of 9,374 white dwarfs, and found that they satisfy
the current observed white dwarfs by SDSS generally have large proper motions.
In addition, we have estimated their effective temperatures by fitting the
polynomial relationship between effective temperature and g-r color of known DZ
white dwarfs, and found 12 of the 29 new DZ white dwarfs are cool, in which
nine are between 6000K and 6600K, and three are below 6000K.

and have to be matched. On the basis of a chase-like procedure for MD
enforcement, we can obtain clean (duplicate-free) instances; actually possibly
several of them. The resolved answers to queries are those that are invariant
under the resulting class of resolved instances. Previous work identified
certain classes of queries and sets of MDs for which resolved query answering
is tractable. Special emphasis was placed on cyclic sets of MDs. In this work
we further investigate the complexity of this problem, identifying intractable
cases, and exploring the frontier between tractability and intractability. We
concentrate mostly on acyclic sets of MDs. For a special case we obtain a
dichotomy result relative to NP-hardness.

expression, biochemical signaling, and spontaneous reversible epigenetic
switchings, we study a simple deterministic cell population dynamics in which
subpopulations grow with different rates and individual cells can
bi-directionally switch between a small number of different epigenetic
phenotypes. Two theories in the past, the population dynamics and
thermodynamics of master equations, separatedly defined two important concepts
in mathematical terms: the {\em fitness} in the former and the (non-adiabatic)
{\em entropy production} in the latter. Both play important roles in the
evolution of the cell population dynamics. The switching sustains the
variations among the subpopulation growth thus continuous natural selection. As
a form of Price's equation, the fitness increases with ($i$) natural selection
through variations and $(ii)$ a positive covariance between the per capita
growth and switching, which represents a Lamarchian-like behavior. A negative
covariance balances the natural selection in a fitness steady state | ""the red
queen"" scenario. At the same time the growth keeps the proportions of
subpopulations away from the ""intrinsic"" switching equilibrium of individual
cells, thus leads to a continous entropy production. A covariance, between the
per capita growth rate and the ""chemical potential"" of subpopulation,
counter-acts the entropy production. Analytical results are obtained for the
limiting cases of growth dominating switching and vice versa.

characteristics of the superconducting state, as it directly refects the
pairing of electrons. In the copper-oxide high temperature superconductors
(HTSCs), a strongly anisotropic energy gap, which vanishes along high symmetry
directions, is a clear manifestation of the d-wave symmetry of the pairing.
There is, however, a dramatic change in the form of the gap anisotropy with
reduced carrier concentration (underdoping). Although the vanishing of the gap
along the diagonal to the square Cu-O bond directions is robust, the doping
dependence of the large gap along the Cu-O directions suggests that its origin
might be different from pairing. It is thus tempting to associate the large gap
with a second order parameter distinct from superconductivity. We use
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to show that the two-gap
behavior, and the destruction of well defined electronic excitations, are not
universal features of HTSCs, and depend sensitively on how the underdoped
materials are prepared. Depending on cation substitution, underdoped samples
either show two-gap behavior or not. In contrast, many other characteristics of
HTSCs, such as the domelike dependence of Tc on doping, long-lived excitations
along the diagonals to the Cu-O bonds, energy gap at the antinode (crossing of
the underlying Fermi surface and the (pi, 0)-(pi, pi) line) decreasing
monotonically with doping, while persisting above Tc (the pseudogap), are
present in all samples, irrespective of whether they exhibit two-gap behavior
or not. Our results imply that universal aspects of high Tc superconductivity
are relatively insensitive to differences in the electronic states along the
Cu-O bond directions.

non-linear regression which has been shown to be competitive with the best
modern predictive methods such as those based on bagging and boosting. BART
offers some advantages. For example, the stochastic search Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) algorithm can provide a more complete search of the model space
and variation across MCMC draws can capture the level of uncertainty in the
usual Bayesian way. The BART prior is robust in that reasonable results are
typically obtained with a default prior specification. However, the publicly

not fast enough to be considered interactive with over a thousand observations,
and is unlikely to even run with 50,000 to 100,000 observations. In this paper
we show how the BART algorithm may be modified and then computed using single
program, multiple data (SPMD) parallel computation implemented using the
Message Passing Interface (MPI) library. The approach scales nearly linearly in
the number of processor cores, enabling the practitioner to perform statistical
inference on massive datasets. Our approach can also handle datasets too

superconductors, in which power spectra have been observed to cross over from a

such crossover must be universal, and can be accounted for by the memory of

$\omega_{obs}$, is larger than the smallest relaxation frequency,
$\Omega_{min}$, a $1/f$ power spectral density is obtained. Conversely, when
$\omega_{obs}<\Omega_{min}$ we predict that the power spectrum of any

integrable functional form provided there is enough time for experimental
observations. This crossover also provides a convenient tool to measure the
lowest relaxation frequency of a physical system.

precise quantitative data, and that they are well-suited for studies of large
networks. While numerous groups have developed specific computational tools
that provide original methods to analyse qualitative models, a standard format
to exchange qualitative models has been missing.
  Results: We present the System Biology Markup Language (SBML) Qualitative
Models Package (""qual""), an extension of the SBML Level 3 standard designed for
computer representation of qualitative models of biological networks. We
demonstrate the interoperability of models via SBML qual through the analysis
of a specific signalling network by three independent software tools.
Furthermore, the cooperative development of the SBML qual format paved the way
for the development of LogicalModel, an open-source model library, which will
facilitate the adoption of the format as well as the collaborative development
of algorithms to analyze qualitative models.
  Conclusion: SBML qual allows the exchange of qualitative models among a
number of complementary software tools. SBML qual has the potential to promote
collaborative work on the development of novel computational approaches, as
well as on the specification and the analysis of comprehensive qualitative
models of regulatory and signalling networks.

Girsanov's measure transformation to obtain an equivalent dynamic team problem
under a reference probability measure, so that the observations and information
structures available for decisions, are not affected by any of the team
decisions. The first method is based on function space integration with respect
to products of Wiener measures, and generalizes Witsenhausen's [1] definition
of equivalence between discrete-time static and dynamic team problems. The
second method is based on stochastic Pontryagin's maximum principle. The team
optimality conditions are given by a ""Hamiltonian System"" consisting of forward
and backward stochastic differential equations, and a conditional variational
Hamiltonian with respect to the information structure of each team member,
expressed under the initial and a reference probability space via Girsanov's

PbP optimality implies team optimality. In addition, we also show existence of
team and PbP optimal relaxed decentralized strategies (conditional
distributions), in the weak$^*$ sense, without imposing convexity on the action
spaces of the team members. Moreover, using the embedding of regular strategies

suspensions controlled by embedded computing elements for preventing rollover
have received a lot of attention. The existing models for synthesizing and
allocating forces in such suspensions are conservatively based on the
constraint that no wheels lift off the ground. However, in practice,
smart/active suspensions are more necessary in the situation where the wheels
have just lifted off the ground. The difficulty in computing control in the
last situation is that the problem requires satisfying disjunctive constraints
on the dynamics. To the authors',knowledge, no efficient solution method is
available for the simulation of dynamics with disjunctive constraints and thus
hardware realizable and accurate force allocation in an active suspension tends
to be a difficulty. In this work we give an algorithm for and simulate
numerical solutions of the force allocation problem as an optimal control
problem constrained by dynamics with disjunctive constraints. In particular we
study the allocation and synthesis of time-dependent active suspension forces
in terms of sensor output data in order to stabilize the roll motion of the
road vehicle. An equivalent constraint in the form of a convex combination
(hull) is proposed to satisfy the disjunctive constraints. The validated
numerical simulations show that it is possible to allocate and synthesize
control forces at the active suspensions from sensor output data such that the
forces stabilize the roll moment of the vehicle with its wheels just lifted off
the ground during arbitrary fish-hook maneuvers.

thermometric scheme relies on fundamental fluctuation-dissipation relations,
connecting the global response to the variation of the applied gauge field and
the fluctuation of quantities related to the momentum distribution (such as the
average kinetic energy or the average current). We demonstrate gauge-field
thermometry for several physical situations, including free fermions and
strongly interacting bosons. The proposed approach is extremely robust to
quantum fluctuations - even in the vicinity of a quantum phase transition -
when it relies on the thermal fluctuations of an emerging classical field,
associated with the onset of Bose condensation or chiral order.

online memory cost. Thus, the problem of the placement of a head and its
dependents (complements or modifiers) that minimizes online memory is
equivalent to the problem of the minimum linear arrangement of a star tree.
However, how that length is translated into cognitive cost is not known. This
study shows that the online memory cost is minimized when the head is placed at
the center, regardless of the function that transforms length into cost,
provided only that this function is strictly monotonically increasing. Online
memory defines a quasi-convex adaptive landscape with a single central minimum
if the number of elements is odd and two central minima if that number is even.
We discuss various aspects of the dynamics of word order of subject (S), verb
(V) and object (O) from a complex systems perspective and suggest that word
orders tend to evolve by swapping adjacent constituents from an initial or
early SOV configuration that is attracted towards a central word order by
online memory minimization. We also suggest that the stability of SVO is due to
at least two factors, the quasi-convex shape of the adaptive landscape in the
online memory dimension and online memory adaptations that avoid regression to
SOV. Although OVS is also optimal for placing the verb at the center, its low
frequency is explained by its long distance to the seminal SOV in the
permutation space.

surface temperature (or buoyancy) variance in strongly rotating, stratified
flows with uniform potential vorticity fields. In particular, using a dynamic,
multi-scale averaging process, we identify a sufficient condition for the
existence of a direct temperature variance cascade across an inertial range.
While the result is consistent with the physical and numerical theories of SQG
turbulence, the condition which triggers the cascade is more exotic, a fact
reflecting the non-locality introduced by fractional dissipation.

  VII', Eds. F. Abergel et al, Springer (2014)",,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The financial characteristics of sects are challenging topics. The present
paper concerns the Antoinist Cult community (ACC), which has appeared at the
end of the 19-th century in Belgium, have had quite an expansion, and is now
decaying. The historical perspective is described in an Appendix. Although
surely of marginal importance in religious history, the numerical and analytic
description of the ACC growth AND decay evolution per se should hopefully
permit generalizations toward behaviors of other sects, with either longer life
time, i.e. so called religions or churches, or to others with shorter life
time. Due to the specific aims and rules of the community, in particular the
lack of proselytism, and strict acceptance of only anonymous financial gifts,
an indirect measure of their member number evolution can only be studied. This
is done here first through the time dependence of new temple inaugurations,
between 1910 and 1940. Besides, the community yearly financial reports can be
analyzed. They are legally known between 1920 and 2000. Interestingly, several
regimes are seen, with different time spans. The agent based model chosen to
describe both temple number and finance evolutions is the Verhulst logistic
function taking into account the limited resources of the population. Such a
function remarkably fits the number of temple evolution, taking into account a
no construction time gap, historically explained. The empirical Gompertz law
can also be used for fitting this number of temple evolution data, as shown in
an Appendix. It is thereby concluded that strong social forces have been acting
both in the growth and decay phases.

al. demonstrates that their results cannot be understood in accordance with
common sense. For example, their results obtained with different measurement
errors are equal to each other for a same neutron state. This is because their
measurement values have a large systematic error due to adopting an incorrect
measurement-value operator, which is the operator that gives the measurement
values of the measured observable. They asserted that their results confirmed
the validity of a universally valid uncertainty relation proposed by Ozawa.
Therefore, their results demonstrate unexpectedly that Ozawa's uncertainty
relation holds true for incorrect measurements. In addition, we have proved
this fact theoretically. The measurement-value operator must be defined in
order that the systematic error of measurement values predicted by the operator
is zero. Such a measurement is called an accurate measurement. Two kind of
uncertainty relations are derived for accurate measurements of a
pre-measurement observable $\hat{x}_0$. In addition, we have presented an
uncertainty relation for accurate measurements of a post-measurement observable
$\hat{x}_t$. Heisenberg's original uncertainty relation for measurement
processes should be interpreted as this relation between the resolution, that
is, the measurement error of the post-measurement observable $\hat{x}_t$ and
the disturbance of an object observable $\hat{y}_0$.

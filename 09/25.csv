fixed field L := K(x_h : h \in G)^G is a purely transcendental extension of K,
where G acts on the x_h by gx_h = x_gh. The field L is naturally the function
field of a quotient variety V := V (K,G). In analogy to the case of curves, we
define the gonality of V to be the minimal degree of a dominant rational map

Oxidation represents a potential path for tuning its properties without
introducing more exotic elements or extreme processing conditions. In this
work, ab initio computational methods are used to examine the energy potentials
and electronic properties of different extents of oxidation in GaN. Solid-state
vibrational properties of Ga, GaN, Ga2O3 and a single substitutional oxygen
defect have been studied using the harmonic approximation with supercells. A
thermodynamic model is outlined which combines the results of ab initio
calculations with data from experimental literature. This model allows free

industrially-relevant conditions, while the formation of defects can be opposed
by the use of high temperatures and a high N2:O2 ratio.

winds and appear as emission line stars, such as WR stars or LBVs. The
quantitative description of the mass loss in these important pre-SN phases is
hampered by unknowns such as clumping and porosity due to an in-homogeneous
wind structure, and by an incomplete theoretical understanding of optically
thick stellar winds. In this work we investigate the conditions in deep
atmospheric layers of WR stars to find out whether these comply with the theory
of optically thick winds, and whether we find indications of clumping in these
layers. We use a new semi-empirical method to determine sonic-point optical
depths, densities, and temperatures for a large sample of WR stars of the
carbon (WC) and oxygen (WO) sequence. Based on an artificial model sequence we
investigate the reliability of our method and its sensitivity to uncertainties
in stellar parameters. We find that the WR stars in our sample obey an
approximate relation with P_rad/P_gas~80 at the sonic point. This 'wind
condition' is ubiquitous for radiatively driven, optically thick winds, and
sets constraints on possible wind/envelope solutions affecting radii, mass-loss
rates, and clumping properties. Our results suggest that the presence of an
optically thick wind may force many stars near the Eddington limit to develop
clumped, radially extended sub-surface zones. The clumping in these zones is
most likely sustained by the non-linear strange-mode instability, and may be
the origin of the observed wind clumping. The properties of typical late-type
WC stars comply with this model. Solutions without sub-surface clumping and
inflation are also possible but demand for compact stars with comparatively low
mass-loss rates. These objects may resemble the small group of WO stars with
their exceptionally hot stellar temperatures and highly ionized winds.

clouds which are the remainders of spiral arm GMAs that have been sheared into

We compare four polynomial approximations as basis functions -- interpolating
Lagrange polynomials, interpolating piecewise-polynomial-form (pp-) splines,
and basis-form (B-) splines (interpolating and smoothing). All these basis
functions provide a similar speedup relative to the planewave basis. The

test the accuracy of the basis functions, we apply them to the ground state

most strongly for MgO and smoothing B-splines most closely reproduce the
planewave value for of the variational Monte Carlo energy. Using separate
approximations for the Laplacian of the orbitals increases the accuracy
sufficiently to justify the increased memory requirement, making smoothing
B-splines, with separate approximation for the Laplacian, the preferred choice

hyperbolic. In the present paper we consider three different types of spatial
asymptotics: cylindrical, bulging and conical. We show that in each case, the
asymptotics are preserved by the Kaehler-Ricci flow. We address long-time
existence, parabolic blowdown limits and the role of the Kaehler-Ricci flow on
the divisor.

feedbacks in dynamical systems has revolutionized science in the latter part of
the last century. Yet despite examples of complicated frequency dynamics, the
possibility of long-term evolutionary chaos is rarely considered. The concept
of ""survival of the fittest"" is central to much evolutionary thinking and
embodies a perspective of evolution as a directional optimization process
exhibiting simple, predictable dynamics. This perspective is adequate for
simple scenarios, when frequency-independent selection acts on scalar
phenotypes. However, in most organisms many phenotypic properties combine in
complicated ways to determine ecological interactions, and hence
frequency-dependent selection. Therefore, it is natural to consider models for
the evolutionary dynamics generated by frequency-dependent selection acting
simultaneously on many different phenotypes. Here we show that complicated,
chaotic dynamics of long-term evolutionary trajectories in phenotype space is
very common in a large class of such models when the dimension of phenotype
space is large, and when there are epistatic interactions between the
phenotypic components. Our results suggest that the perspective of evolution as
a process with simple, predictable dynamics covers only a small fragment of
long-term evolution. Our analysis may also be the first systematic study of the
occurrence of chaos in multidimensional and generally dissipative systems as a
function of the dimensionality of phase space.

leading to highly reproducible macroscopic outcomes of developmental processes.
The origins of this reproducibility can be found at the molecular level during
the earliest stages of development when spatial patterns of morphogen
(form-generating) molecules emerge reproducibly. However, the initial
conditions for these early stages are determined by the female during
oogenesis, and it is unknown whether reproducibility is passed on to the zygote
or whether it is reacquired by the zygote. Here we examine the earliest
reproducible pattern in the Drosophila embryo, the Bicoid protein gradient.
Using a unique combination of absolute molecule counting techniques, we show
that it is generated from a highly controlled source of mRNA molecules that is
reproducible from embryo to embryo to within ~8%. This occurs in a perfectly
linear feed-forward process: changes in the female's gene dosage lead to
proportional changes in the mRNA and protein counts in the embryo. In this
setup, noise is kept low in the transition from one molecular species to
another, allowing the female to precisely deposit the same absolute number of
mRNA molecules in each embryo and therefore confer reproducibility to the
Bicoid pattern. Our results indicate that the reproducibility of the
morphological structures that emerge in the embryo originates during oogenesis
when all initial patterning signals are controlled with precision similar to
what we observe for the Bicoid pattern.

excitability. However, the HH model does not capture a number of biophysical
behaviors associated with action potentials or propagating nerve impulses.
Physical mechanisms underlying these processes, such as reversible heat
transfer and axonal swelling have been separately investigated and
compartmentally modeled to indicate the nervous system is not purely electrical
or biochemical. Rather, mechanical forces and principles of thermodynamics also
govern neuronal excitability and signaling. To advance our understanding of
neural function and dysfunction, compartmentalized analyses of electrical,
chemical, and mechanical processes need to revaluated and integrated into more
comprehensive theories. The present quantitative perspective is intended to
broaden the awareness of known biophysical phenomena, which are often
overlooked in neuroscience. By starting to consider the collective influence of
the biophysical forces influencing neural function, new paradigms can be
applied to the characterization and manipulation of nervous systems.

affect the orbital evolution of the entire system. While tides usually damp
eccentricities, a novel mechanism identified by Correia et al. (2012) tends to
raise eccentricities as a result of the tides' effect on the inner planet's
rotation. Our analytical description of this spin-driven tidal (SDT) effect
shows that, while the inner planet's eccentricity undergoes pumping, the
process is more completely described by an exchange of strength between the two
eigenmodes of the dynamical system. Our analysis allows derivation of criteria
for two-planet coplanar systems where the SDT effect can reverse tidal damping,
and may preclude the effect's being significant for realistic systems. For the
specific case quantified by Correia et al., the effect is strong because of the
large adopted tidal time lag, which may not be appropriate for the assumed
Saturn-like inner planet. On the other hand, the effective Q for any given
planet in exotic circumstances is very uncertain, so the SDT effect could play
a role in planetary evolution.

regularizer consists of a L_1 norm plus a pair-wise L_inf norm (responsible for
its grouping behavior) and was proposed to encourage group sparsity in
scenarios where the groups are a priori unknown. The OSCAR regularizer has a
non-trivial proximity operator, which limits its applicability. We reformulate
this regularizer as a weighted sorted L_1 norm, and propose its grouping
proximity operator (GPO) and approximate proximity operator (APO), thus making
state-of-the-art proximal splitting algorithms (PSAs) available to solve
inverse problems with OSCAR regularization. The GPO is in fact the APO followed
by additional grouping and averaging operations, which are costly in time and
storage, explaining the reason why algorithms with APO are much faster than
that with GPO. The convergences of PSAs with GPO are guaranteed since GPO is an
exact proximity operator. Although convergence of PSAs with APO is may not be
guaranteed, we have experimentally found that APO behaves similarly to GPO when
the regularization parameter of the pair-wise L_inf norm is set to an
appropriately small value. Experiments on recovery of group-sparse signals

for the stress-energy tensor. Furthermore, it is possible to control this
expectation value by means of a global estimate on regular cosmological
spacetimes. The obtained estimates permit to write a theorem about the
existence and uniqueness of the local solutions encompassing both the spacetime
metric and the matter field simultaneously. Finally, we show that one can

bulk of the detected HI arises in a bound, cool, low-density photoionized
diffuse medium that is generic to all L* galaxies and may harbor a total
gaseous mass comparable to galactic stellar masses.

response to this event we carried out a five epoch centimeter- to
millimeter-band multifrequency Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) campaign to
investigate the aftermath of this emission event. Rapid radio variations are
unprecedented in this object and are surprising in an HSP BL Lac object. In
this flare, the 15 GHz flux density increased with an exponential doubling time
of about 9 days, then faded to its prior level at a similar rate. This is
comparable with the fastest large-amplitude centimeter-band radio variability
observed in any blazar. Similar flux density increases were detected up to
millimeter bands. This radio flare followed about two months after a similarly
unprecedented GeV gamma-ray flare (reaching a daily E>100 MeV flux of (1.2 +/-

cross-correlation analysis of long-term 15 GHz and LAT gamma-ray light curves
finds a statistically significant correlation with the radio lagging ~40 days
behind, suggesting that the gamma-ray emission originates upstream of the radio
emission. Preliminary results from our VLBA observations show brightening in
the unresolved core region and no evidence for apparent superluminal motions or
substantial flux variations downstream.

important open questions of current stellar evolution theory. Episodic mass
loss produces dust and therefore causes evolved massive stars to be very
luminous in the mid-infrared and dim at optical wavelengths. We aim to increase
the number of investigated luminous mid-IR sources to shed light on the late
stages of these objects. To achieve this we employed mid-IR selection criteria
to identity dusty evolved massive stars in two nearby galaxies. The method is
based on mid-IR colors, using 3.6 {\mu}m and 4.5 {\mu}m photometry from
archival Spitzer Space Telescope images of nearby galaxies and J-band
photometry from 2MASS. We applied our criteria to two nearby star-forming dwarf
irregular galaxies, Sextans A and IC 1613, selecting eight targets, which we
followed up with spectroscopy. Our spectral classification and analysis yielded
the discovery of two M-type supergiants in IC 1613, three K-type supergiants
and one candidate F-type giant in Sextans A, and two foreground M giants. We
show that the proposed criteria provide an independent way for identifying
dusty evolved massive stars, that can be extended to all nearby galaxies with

more luminous quasars live in bulge-dominated hosts, in conflict with some
previous model predictions. We therefore build and compare a semi-empirical
model for AGN fueling which accounts for both merger and non-merger
'triggering.' In particular, we show that the 'stochastic accretion' model - in
which fueling in disk galaxies is essentially a random process arising whenever
dense gas clouds reach the nucleus - provides a good match to the present
observations at low/intermediate luminosities. However it falls short of the
high-luminosity population. We combine this with models for major
merger-induced AGN fueling, which lead to rarer but more luminous events, and
predict the resulting abundance of disk-dominated and bulge-dominated AGN host
galaxies as a function of luminosity and redshift. We compile and compare
observational constraints from z~0-2. The models and observations generically
show a transition from disk to bulge dominance in hosts near the Seyfert-quasar
transition, at all redshifts. 'Stochastic' fueling dominates AGN by number
(dominant at low luminosity), and dominates BH growth below the knee in the
present-day BH mass function (<10^7 M_sun). However it accounts for just ~10%
of BH mass growth at masses >10^8 M_sun. In total, fueling in disky hosts
accounts for ~30% of the total AGN luminosity density/BH mass density. The
combined model also accurately predicts the AGN luminosity function and
clustering/bias as a function of luminosity and redshift; however, we argue
that these are not sensitive probes of BH fueling mechanisms.

dispersion, we stack regions several kilo-parsecs in size, after accounting for
intrinsic velocity shifts due to galactic rotation and large-scale motions. We
stack using various parameters: the galacto-centric distance, star formation
rate surface density, HI surface density, H2 surface density, and total gas
surface density. We fit single Gaussian components to the stacked spectra and
measure median velocity dispersions for HI of 11.9 +/- 3.1 km/s and for H2 of
12.0 +/- 3.9 km/s. The CO velocity dispersions are thus, surprisingly, very
similar to the corresponding ones of HI, with an average ratio of
sigma(HI)/sigma(CO) = 1.0 +/- 0.2 irrespective of the stacking parameter. The
measured CO velocity dispersions are significantly higher (factor 2) than the
traditional picture of a cold molecular gas disk associated with star
formation. The high dispersion implies an additional thick molecular gas disk
(possibly as thick as the HI disk). Our finding is in agreement with recent
sensitive measurements in individual edge-on and face-on galaxies and points
towards the general existence of a thick disk of molecular gas, in addition to
the well-known thin disk in nearby spiral galaxies.

model of holographic steady state turbulence. In recent work, Bhattacharyya et
al have constructed long wavelength asymptotically locally AdS_5 bulk
spacetimes with a slowly varying boundary dilaton field which are dual to
forced fluid flows on the 4-dimensional boundary. In this paper, we generalise
their work to arbitrary spacetime dimensions; we explicitly compute the dual
bulk metric, the fluid dynamical stress tensor and Lagrangian to second order
in a boundary derivative expansion.

Ten different low Sigma grain boundaries from the <100> and <110> symmetric

formation/binding energies for 1-2 He atoms in the substitutional and
interstitial sites (HeV, He2V, HeInt, He2Int) at all potential grain boundary
sites within 15 Angstroms of the boundary (52826 simulations total). The
present results provide detailed information about the interaction energies and
length scales of 1-2 He atoms with grain boundaries for the structures
examined. A number of interesting new findings emerge from the present study.
For instance, we find that the Sigma3(112) twin boundary in BCC Fe possesses a
much smaller binding energy than other boundaries, which corresponds in long
time dynamics simulations to the ability of an interstitial He defect to break
away from the boundary in simulations on the order of nanoseconds, in contrast
to other boundaries. Additionally, we find that the calculated
formation/binding energies for substitutional He (i.e., He in a monovacancy)
correlates well (R>0.9) with interstitial He, substitutional He2, and
interstitial He2 energies for the same atomic site. This correlation asserts
that the local environment surrounding each site strongly influences the He
defect energies and that highly accurate quantum mechanics calculations of
lower order defects may be an adequate predictor of higher order defects. The
present work shows that the binding and formation energies for He defects are
important for understanding the physics of He diffusion and trapping by grain
boundaries, which can be important for modeling He interactions in
polycrystalline steels.

galaxy, NGC 4125, which has strong and extended submillimeter emission from

Depending on the dust emissivity, the total dust mass is 2-5x10^6 Msun. While
the neutral gas-to-dust mass ratio is extremely low (< 12-30), including the
ionized gas traced by [CII] emission raises this limit to < 39-100. The dust
emission follows a similar r^{1/4} profile to the stellar light and the dust to
stellar mass ratio is towards the high end of what is found in nearby
elliptical galaxies. We suggest that NGC 4125 is currently in an unusual phase
where evolved stars produced in a merger-triggered burst of star formation are
pumping large amounts of gas and dust into the interstellar medium. In this
scenario, the low neutral gas-to-dust mass ratio is explained by the gas being
heated to temperatures >= 10^4 K faster than the dust is evaporated. If
galaxies like NGC 4125, where the far-infrared emission does not trace neutral
gas in the usual manner, are common at higher redshift, this could have
significant implications for our understanding of high redshift galaxies and
galaxy evolution.

regions within a three-dimensional, kinematic dynamo framework. By imposing
localised velocity perturbations, we create emergent flux-tubes out of toroidal
magnetic field at the base of the convection zone, leading to the eruption of
active regions at the solar surface. The velocity perturbations are calibrated
to reproduce observed active region properties (including the size and flux of
active regions, and the distribution of tilt angle with latitude), resulting in
a more consistent treatment of flux-tube emergence in kinematic dynamo models
than artificial flux deposition. We demonstrate how this technique can be used
to assimilate observations and drive a kinematic 3D model, and use it to study
the characteristics of active region emergence and decay as a source of
poloidal field. We find that the poloidal components are strongest not at the
solar surface, but in the middle convection zone, in contrast with the common
assumption that the poloidal source is located near the solar surface. We also
find that, while most of the energy is contained in the lower convection zone,
there is a good correlation between the evolution of the surface and interior
magnetic fields.

the superconducting performance. In this study, a novel solution with the F/Ba

10.3% of that used in the conventional TFA-MOD method. Attenuated total
reflectance-Fourier transformed-infrared spectra(ATR-FT-IR) revealed that
BaCO_3 was remarkably suppressed in the as-pyrolyzed film and eliminated at 700
Celsius degree. Thus YBCO films with a critical current density (J_c) over 5 MA
cm^{-2} (77 K, 0 T, 200 nm thickness) could be obtained on LAO single crystal
substrates. In-situ FT-IR spectra showed that no obvious fluorinated gaseous
by-products were detected in the pyrolysis step, which indicated that all of
the F atoms might remain in the film as fluorides. X-ray diffraction (XRD)
\theta/2\theta-scan showed that BaF_2, but neither YF_3 nor CuF_2, was detected
in the films quenched at 400 - 800 Celsius degree. The formation priority of
BaF_2 over YF_3 and CuF_2 was interpreted by the chemical equilibrium of the
potential reactions. Our study could enlarge the synthesis window of the
precursor solution for MOD-YBCO fabrication and open a gate to study the
fluorine content in the precursor solution continuously and systematically.

make the assumption that the linewidth involves the static susceptibility of
the Mn4+ spins which we analyze in the molecular field approximation. We
conclude that the linear dependence on temperature is associated with the
susceptibility having a Curie or Curie-Weiss form while the
temperature-dependent relaxation mechanism has a microscopic rate proportional
to the temperature. In La0.7Ca0.3MnO3, the Mn4+ susceptibility has the
ferromagnetic Curie-Weiss form, and the static contribution to the linewidth
arising from distortions of the oxygen octahedra is absent due to motional
narrowing brought on by the rapid hopping of the eg polarons. In YBaMn2O6
either of two scenarios is possible. The Mn4+ susceptibility above 520 K is
Curie-like and the static term is present, or the susceptibility has the
antiferromagnetic Curie-Weiss form and the static term is absent due to
motional narrowing. It is concluded that the Curie model, with offsetting
double exchange and and superexchange Curie-Weiss parameters, is the more
likely scenario. It is suggested that the linear-T variation of the linewidth
in both materials arises from either a Korringa-like mechanism involving
interactions with mobile carriers or from a spin-phonon process coming from

spin down with age and become inactive, an input of angular momentum through
tidal interaction, as seen for example in close binaries, can preserve high
activity levels over time. This may also be the case for cool stars hosting a
Hot Jupiter. However, selection effects from planet detection methods often
dominate the activity levels seen in samples of exoplanet host stars, and
planet-induced, systematically enhanced stellar activity has not been detected
unambiguously so far. We have developed an approach to identify planet-induced
stellar spin-up avoiding the selection biases from planet detection, by using
visual proper motion binaries in which only one of the stars possesses a Hot
Jupiter. This approach immediately rids one of the ambiguities of detection
biases: with two co-eval stars, the second star acts as a negative control. We

generalizations of propensity score methods, namely, the propensity function

with the original GPS are less flexible than those typically used with
propensity score methods and are prone to misspecification. We compare new and

scales arising in macromolecular systems. This crosstalk is accounted for by
Trotter factorization, which is used to separate the all-atom from the
coarse-grained phases of the computation. In this approach, short molecular
dynamics runs are used to advance in time the coarse-grained variables, which
in turn guide the all-atom state. To achieve this coevolution, an all-atom
microstate consistent with the updated coarse-grained variables must be
recovered. This recovery is cast here as a non-linear optimization problem that
is solved with a quasi-Newton method. The approach yields a Boltzmann-relevant

results that demonstrate the existence of two different self-injection
mechanisms. Transverse self-injection is shown to lead to low stability and
poor quality electron beams, because of a strong dependence on the intensity
profile of the laser pulse. In contrast, longitudinal injection, which is
unambiguously observed for the first time, is shown to lead to much more stable
acceleration and higher quality electron beams.

Decrease value theorem of Foata and Han. Using this generating function

Chung-Graham-Knuth symmetrical Eulerian identity for some flag Eulerian
quasisymmetric functions, which are specialized to the flag excedance numbers.
Combinatorial proofs of those symmetrical identities are also constructed.
  We also study some other properties of the flag Eulerian quasisymmetric

social entity will adopt a product, service, or opinion in the foreseeable
future. Such probabilities are central to fundamental issues in social network
analysis, including the influence maximization problem. In practice, adoption
probabilities have significant implications for applications ranging from
social network-based target marketing to political campaigns; yet, predicting
adoption probabilities has not received sufficient research attention. Building
on relevant social network theories, we identify and operationalize key factors
that affect adoption decisions: social influence, structural equivalence,
entity similarity, and confounding factors. We then develop the
locally-weighted expectation-maximization method for Na\""ive Bayesian learning
to predict adoption probabilities on the basis of these factors. The principal
challenge addressed in this study is how to predict adoption probabilities in
the presence of confounding factors that are generally unobserved. Using data
from two large-scale social networks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method. The empirical results also suggest that cascade methods
primarily using social influence to predict adoption probabilities offer
limited predictive power, and that confounding factors are critical to adoption
probability predictions.

permanent rotation for as long as the vortex remains within the condensate. We
use two different ways of measuring the circulation of the condensate and

model is found to exhibit a first order phase transition from flocking to
decoherence, as the 'noise parameter' of the problem is increased, whereas
Viscek's model gives a second order transition. Refining the topological model
in such a way that birds are influenced mostly by the birds in front of them,
less by the ones at their sides and not at all by those behind them (because
they do not see them), we find a behavior that lies in between the two models.
Finally, we propose a novel mechanism for preserving the flock's cohesion,
without imposing artificial boundary conditions or attracting forces.

propose a Bayesian model for estimating the white matter atlas from HYDIs. We
adopt the work given in Hosseinbor et al. (2012) and represent the q-space
diffusion signal with the Bessel Fourier orientation reconstruction (BFOR)
signal basis. The BFOR framework provides the representation of mDWI in the
q-space and thus reduces memory requirement. In addition, since the BFOR signal
basis is orthonormal, the L2 norm that quantifies the differences in the
q-space signals of any two mDWI datasets can be easily computed as the sum of
the squared differences in the BFOR expansion coefficients. In this work, we
show that the reorientation of the $q$-space signal due to spatial
transformation can be easily defined on the BFOR signal basis. We incorporate
the BFOR signal basis into the LDDMM framework and derive the gradient descent
algorithm for LDDMM-HYDI with explicit orientation optimization. Additionally,
we extend the previous Bayesian atlas estimation framework for scalar-valued
images to HYDIs and derive the expectation-maximization algorithm for solving
the HYDI atlas estimation problem. Using real HYDI datasets, we show the
Bayesian model generates the white matter atlas with anatomical details.
Moreover, we show that it is important to consider the variation of mDWI
reorientation due to a small change in diffeomorphic transformation in the
LDDMM-HYDI optimization and to incorporate the full information of HYDI for
aligning mDWI.

crystalline bulk, and two-dimensional (2D) substrate, represented by graphene
and hexagonal boron nitride. At the monomer-2D contact, the permanent dipole of
LiBH4 induces polarization of the pi electrons of the 2D, and the resultant
permanent dipole-induced dipole attraction becomes the main source of binding.
At the bulk-2D interface van der Waals attraction dominates the interfacial
binding rather than the dipole-diploe attraction. The absolute values of the
calculated interface energy match closely with the surface energy of pristine
(001) LiBH4, hinting that the energy released by the formation of the interface
has enough magnitude to overcome the surface energy of LiBH4.

for visualizing the model estimated by any supervised learning algorithm.
Classical partial dependence plots (PDPs) help visualize the average partial
relationship between the predicted response and one or more features. In the
presence of substantial interaction effects, the partial response relationship
can be heterogeneous. Thus, an average curve, such as the PDP, can obfuscate
the complexity of the modeled relationship. Accordingly, ICE plots refine the
partial dependence plot by graphing the functional relationship between the
predicted response and the feature for individual observations. Specifically,
ICE plots highlight the variation in the fitted values across the range of a
covariate, suggesting where and to what extent heterogeneities might exist. In
addition to providing a plotting suite for exploratory analysis, we include a
visual test for additive structure in the data generating model. Through
simulated examples and real data sets, we demonstrate how ICE plots can shed
light on estimated models in ways PDPs cannot. Procedures outlined are

(B_{\mu\nu}^I, \chi^I, \varphi^I) and an extra vector multiplet (K_\mu^I,
\rho^I, C_{\mu\nu\rho}^I) with the index I for the adjoint representation of a

dual to the conventional auxiliary field D^I for the extra vector multiplet.

respectively the scalar \varphi^I and the tensor B_{\mu\nu}^I. The superpartner
fermion \rho^I acquires a Dirac mass shared with \chi^I. We fix all non-trivial

by $A^2(\sigma)m$ where $\sigma$ is the Brans-Dicke field and $A(\sigma)$ is
conformal coupling and show that there is no viable thermal history of the
universe in this case. We then invoke a cubic galileon term as nonlinear
completion of the $\sigma$ Lagrangian and show that there is a stable de Sitter
solution in this case. However, the de Sitter is blocked by the matter phase
which is also a simultaneous attractor of the dynamics. The de Sitter phase
can, however, be realized by invoking unnatural fine tunings. We next
investigate cosmology of quasi-dilaton nonlinear massive gravity with
non-minimal coupling. As a generic feature of the non-minimal coupling, we show
that the model exhibits a transient phantom phase which is otherwise
impossible. While performing the observational data analysis on the models, we
find that a small value of coupling constant is allowed for quasi-dilaton
nonlinear massive gravity. For both the cases under consideration, it is
observed that we have an effective pressure of matter which comes from the
constraint equation. For mass-varying nonlinear massive gravity in the
Brans-Dicke background, the effective pressure of matter is non zero which
affects the evolution of the Hubble parameter thereby spoiling consistency of
the model with data. As for, quasi-dilaton nonlinear massive gravity, the
effective pressure of matter can be kept around zero by controlling the
coupling constant, the model is shown to be fit well with observations.

master the fundamental conflicting requirements of quantum technology: fast and
accurate systems control together with perfect shielding from the environment,

Excellent examples for hybrid quantum systems are heterogeneous spin systems
where electron spins are used for readout and control while nuclear spins are
used as long-lived quantum bits. Here we show that joint initialization,
projective readout and fast local and non-local gate operations are no longer
conflicting requirements in those systems, even under ambient conditions. We
demonstrate high-fidelity initialization of a whole spin register (99 %) and
single-shot readout of multiple individual nuclear spins by using the ancillary
electron spin of a nitrogen-vacancy defect in diamond. Implementation of a
novel non-local gate generic to our hybrid electron-nuclear quantum register
allows to prepare entangled states of three nuclear spins, with fidelities
exceeding 85 %. An important tool for scalable quantum computation is quantum
error correction. Combining, for the first time, optimal-control based error
avoidance with error correction, we realize a three-qubit phase-flip error
correction algorithm. Utilizing optimal control, all of the above algorithms
achieve fidelities approaching fault tolerant quantum operation, thus paving
the way to large scale integrations. Our techniques can be used to improve
scaling of quantum networks relying on diamond spins, phosphorous in silicon or
other spin systems like quantum dots, silicon carbide or rare earth ions in

surrounding claims and counter-claims of giant piezoresistance in Silicon

that i) reproducible evidence for a giant piezoresistance effect in un-gated

reproduced by several authors, iii) the giant effect is fundamentally different
from either the bulk Silicon piezoresistance or that due to quantum confinement

electrostatic origin for the piezoresistance, iv) released nanowires tend to
have slightly larger piezoresistance coefficients than un-released nanowires,

able to rule out a fundamental difference in their properties when compared

personally-expensive pro-environmental behaviors, environmental and behavioral
economists have examined a moral-motivation model in which the decision to
adopt a pro-environmental behavior depends on the society-wide market share of
that behavior. An increasing body of practical research on adoption of
pro-environmental behavior emphasizes the importance of encouragement from
local social contacts and messaging about locally-embraced norms: we respond by
extending the moral-motivation model to a social networks setting. We obtain a
new decision rule: an individual adopts a pro-environmental behavior if he or
she observes a certain threshold of adoption within their local social
neighborhood. This gives rise to a concurrent update process which describes
adoption of a pro-environmental behavior spreading through a network. The
original moral-motivation model corresponds to the special case of our network
version in a complete graph.
  By improving convergence results, we formulate modest-size Integer Programs
that accurately (but not efficiently) find minimum-size sets of nodes that
convert the entire network, or alternately that maximize long-term adoption in
the network given a limited number of nodes which may be temporarily converted.
Issues of stability in determining long-term adoption are key. We give hardness
of approximation results for these optimization problems. We demonstrate that
there exist classes of networks which qualitatively have severely different
behavior than the non-networked version, and provide preliminary computational
results in in modestly-sized highly-clustered small-world networks related to

graph (i.e. the vertex intersection graph) of the paths P, and EPT(P) is the
EPT graph (i.e. the edge intersection graph) of P. These graphs have been
extensively studied in the literature. Given two (edge) intersecting paths in a
graph, their split vertices is the set of vertices having degree at least 3 in
their union. A pair of (edge) intersecting paths is termed non-splitting if
they do not have split vertices (namely if their union is a path). We define
the graph ENPT(P) of edge intersecting non-splitting paths of a tree, termed
the ENPT graph, as the graph having a vertex for each path in P, and an edge
between every pair of vertices representing two paths that are both
edge-intersecting and non-splitting. A graph G is an ENPT graph if there is a
tree T and a set of paths P of T such that G=ENPT(P), and we say that <T,P> is
a representation of G.
  Our goal is to characterize the representation of chordless ENPT cycles
(holes). To achieve this goal, we first assume that the EPT graph induced by
the vertices of an ENPT hole is given. In [2] we introduce three assumptions
(P1), (P2), (P3) defined on EPT, ENPT pairs of graphs. In the same study, we
define two problems HamiltonianPairRec, P3-HamiltonianPairRec and characterize
the representations of ENPT holes that satisfy (P1), (P2), (P3).
  In this work, we continue our work by relaxing these three assumptions one by
one. We characterize the representations of ENPT holes satisfying (P3) by
providing a polynomial-time algorithm to solve P3-HamiltonianPairRec. We also
show that there does not exist a polynomial-time algorithm to solve
HamiltonianPairRec, unless P=NP.

region where the black body emits at 313K. The study of absorption enhancement
in this butterfly could be helpful to design highly absorbent biomimetic

reveal that the scales covering the wings are deeply nanostructured. A periodic

used for numerical transfer-matrix simulations of the absorption spectrum. The

building a similarity graph which describes the neighborhood relations among

performance. However, these methods have suffered from the following two
limitations. First, the time complexities of these methods are at least
proportional to the cube of the data size, which make those methods inefficient
for solving large-scale problems. Second, they cannot cope with out-of-sample

out-of-sample datum, the methods have to recalculate the similarity graph and
the cluster membership of the whole data set. In this paper, we propose a
unified framework which makes representation-based subspace clustering
algorithms feasible to cluster both out-of-sample and large-scale data. Under
our framework, the large-scale problem is tackled by converting it as
out-of-sample problem in the manner of ""sampling, clustering, coding, and
classifying"". Furthermore, we give an estimation for the error bounds by
treating each subspace as a point in a hyperspace. Extensive experimental
results on various benchmark data sets show that our methods outperform several

particular, we want to determine above which gas density this variation arises
and what changes in the grain optical properties/size distribution are
required. We use the 3D radiative transfer code CRT, coupled to the dust
emission and extinction code DustEM, to model the emission and extinction of
the dense filament. We test a range of optical properties and size
distributions for the grains: dust of the diffuse interstellar medium
(interstellar PAHs and amorphous carbons and silicates) and both compact and
fluffy aggregates. We find that the grain opacity has to increase across the
filament to fit simultaneously the near-IR extinction and Herschel emission
profiles of L1506. We interpret this change to be a consequence of the
coagulation of dust grains to form fluffy aggregates. Grains similar to those
in the diffuse medium have to be present in the outer layers of the cloud,
whereas aggregates must prevail above gas densities of a few 1000 H/cm3. This
corresponds to line-of-sights with visual extinction in the V band of the order
of 2 to 3. The dust opacity at 250 microns is raised by a factor of 1.8 to 2.2,
while the grain average size is increased by a factor of 5. These exact numbers
depend naturally on the dust model chosen to fit the data. Our findings agree
with the constraints given by the study of the gas molecular lines. Using a
simple approach, we show that the aggregates may have time to form inside the
filament within the cloud lifetime. Our model also characterises the density
structure of the filament, showing that the filament width is not constant

determine the bond operator representation for the spin operators in terms of

the J_1-J_2 model and an effective interacting boson model in terms of singlets

for J_2 < 0.48 J_1, the excitation gap corresponds to a singlet-triplet

singlet-singlet excitation at the X = (pi/2,0) point of the tetramerized

are performed in the framework of the Lifshitz theory at nonzero temperature

of surface roughness using both the Drude and the plasma model approaches. The

between experiment and theory is done using the rigorous statistical method. It
is shown that the theoretical approach taking into account dissipation of free

neglecting dissipation is confirmed by the data at more than 90% confidence

particles may (de)lithiate discretely in a process referred to as mosaic
instability. This instability could be the key to elucidating the complex

this paper, the dynamics of the mosaic instability is studied using Smoothed
Boundary Method simulations at the particle level, where the concentration and
electrostatic potential fields are spatially resolved around individual

identical radius are employed to study the instability in detail. The effect of
an activity-dependent exchange current density on the mosaic instability, which
leads to asymmetric charge/discharge, is also studied. While we show that our
model reproduces the results of a porous-electrode model for the simple setup

detailed dynamics in three-dimensional complex electrodes and provides further
insights into the complex dynamics that result from the coupling of

frequency of the external force passes through the value of the frequency of
the unperturbed pendulum's oscillations, the pendulum can be captured into the
resonance. The captured pendulum oscillates in such a way that the resonance is
preserved, and the amplitude of the oscillations accordingly grows. We consider
this problem in the frames of a standard Hamiltonian approach to resonant
phenomena in slow-fast Hamiltonian systems developed earlier, and evaluate the
probability of capture into the resonance. If the system passes the resonance
at small enough initial amplitudes of the pendulum, the capture occurs with
necessity (so-called autoresonance). In general, the probability of capture
varies between one and zero, depending on the initial amplitude. We demonstrate
that a pendulum captured at small values of its amplitude escapes from the
resonance in the domain of oscillations close to the separatrix of the
pendulum, and evaluate the amplitude of the oscillations at the escape.

Traditionally, low-mass young stellar objects are classified according to the
shape of their SEDs. Such methods are however prone to misclassification due to
degeneracy and do not constrain the temporal evolution. More recently, young
stellar objects have been classified based on envelope, disk, and stellar
masses determined from resolved images of their continuum and line emission at
submillimeter wavelengths. Through detailed modeling of two Class I sources, we
aim at determining accurate velocity profiles and explore the role of
freeze-out chemistry in such objects. We present new Submillimeter Array
observations of the continuum and HCO$^+$ line emission at 1.1 mm toward two
protostars, IRS 63 and IRS 43 in the Ophiuchus star forming region. The sources
are modeled in detail using dust radiation transfer to fit the SED and
continuum images and line radiation transfer to produce synthetic
position-velocity diagrams. We use a $\chi^2$ search algorithm to find the best
model fit to the data and to estimate the errors in the model variables. Our
best fit models present disk, envelope and stellar masses as well as the
HCO$^+$ abundance and inclination of both sources. We also identify a ring
structure with a radius of about 200 AU in IRS 63. We find that freeze-out
chemistry is important in IRS 63 but not for IRS 43. We show that the velocity
field in IRS 43 is consistent with Keplerian rotation. Due to molecular
depletion, it is not possible to draw a similar conclusion for IRS 63. We

carried out a multi-wavelength analysis using the EUV images from the
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and magnetic fields from the Helioseismic
and Magnetic Imager (HMI) both on-board the SDO satellite. The jet consisted of
many different threads that expanded in around 10 minutes to about 100 Mm in
length, with the bright features in later threads moving faster than in the
early ones, reaching a maximum speed of about 200 km s^{-1}. Time-slice
analysis revealed a striped pattern of dark and bright strands propagating
along the jet, along with apparent damped oscillations across the jet. This is
suggestive of a (un)twisting motion in the jet, possibly an Alfven wave. A
topological analysis of an extrapolated field was performed. Bald patches in
field lines, low-altitude flux ropes, diverging flow patterns, and a null point
were identified at the basis of the jet. Unlike classical lambda or
Eiffel-tower shaped jets that appear to be caused by reconnection in current
sheets containing null points, reconnection in regions containing bald patches
seems to be crucial in triggering the present jet. There is no observational
evidence that the flux ropes detected in the topological analysis were actually
being ejected themselves, as occurs in the violent phase of blowout jets;
instead, the jet itself may have gained the twist of the flux rope(s) through
reconnection. This event may represent a class of jets different from the
classical quiescent or blowout jets, but to reach that conclusion, more
observational and theoretical work is necessary.

towards AGN hosting water masers, especially when the H2O emission is
associated with the nuclear accretion disk. In addition, possible correlations
between the intrinsic X-ray luminosity and the characteristics of the H2O maser
emission have been put forward that, however, require confirmation. We have
performed high-sensitivity XMM-Newton observations of a sample of five H2O
maser sources confidently detected in our ongoing survey with the Swift
satellite of all known water masers in AGN, in order to obtain detailed X-ray
information of these promising targets and to set up a systematic detailed
study of the X-ray/H2O-maser relation in AGN. For three galaxies, NGC 613,
VIIZw73, and IRAS 16288+3929, the amount of intrinsic absorption has been
estimated, indicating column densities of 4-6x10^23 cm^-2. For UGC 3789 and NGC
6264 (the two confirmed disk-maser galaxies in our sample), column densities in
excess of 1x10^24 cm^-2 are inferred from the large EW of the Fe Kalpha line.
By adding our results to those obtained in past similar studies, we find that
the percentage of water masers sources that host highly-obscured (NH>10^23
cm^-2) and Compton-thick AGN is 96% (45/47) and 57% (27/47), respectively. In
addition, 86%, 18/21, of disk maser galaxies host Compton-thick AGN. The
correlation between the galaxies' bolometric luminosity and accretion disk

relativistic high-energy processes, provided that the necessary subtleties are
accounted for. An important subtlety is the need to include eikonal phases for
a rapidity-dependent collection of particles, as embodied by the
Balitsky-JIMWLK rapidity evolution equation. In the first part of this paper,
we review how the phenomenon of gluon reggeization and the BFKL equations can
be understood simply (but not too simply) in the eikonal approach. We also work
out some previously overlooked implications of BFKL dynamics, including the
observation that starting from four loops it is incompatible with a recent
conjecture regarding the structure of infrared divergences. In the second part
of this paper, we propose that in the strict planar limit the theory can be
developed to all orders in the coupling with no reference at all to the concept
of ""reggeized gluon."" Rather, one can work directly with a finite,
process-dependent, number of Wilson lines. We demonstrate consistency of this
proposal by an exact computation in N=4 super Yang-Mills, which shows that in
processes mediated with two Wilson lines the reggeized gluon appears in the
weak coupling limit as a resonance whose width is proportional to the coupling.
We also provide a precise operator definition of Lipatov's integrable spin
chain, which is manifestly integrable at any value of the coupling as a result
of the duality between scattering amplitudes and Wilson loops in this theory.

  Conference, ICRC2013)",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  Fast magnetic reconnection events can be a very powerful mechanism operating
at the jet launching region of microquasars and AGNs. We have recently found
that the power released by reconnection between the magnetic field lines of the
coronal inner disk region and the lines anchored into the black hole is able to
accelerate relativistic particles through a first-order Fermi process and
produce the observed radio luminosity from both microquasars and low luminous
AGNs (LLAGNs). We also found that the observed correlation between the radio
luminosity and the mass of these sources, spanning 10^9 orders of magnitude in
mass, is naturally explained by this process. In this work, assuming that the
gamma-ray emission is probably originated in the same acceleration zones that
produce the radio emission, we have applied the scenario above to investigate
the origin of the high energy outcomes from an extensive number of sources
including high (HLAGNs) and LLAGNs, microquasars and GRBs. We find correlation
of our model with the gamma emission only for microquasars and a few LLAGNs,
while none of the HLAGNs or GRBs are fitted, neither in radio nor in gamma. We
attribute the lack of correlation of the gamma emission for most of the LLAGNs
to the fact that this processed emission doesn't depend only on the local
magnetic field activity around the source/accretion disk, but also on other
environmental factors like the photon and density fields. We conclude that the
emission from the LLAGNs and microquasars comes from the nuclear region of
their sources and therefore, can be driven by nuclear magnetic activity.
However, in the case of the HLAGNs and GRBs, the nuclear emission is blocked by
the surrounding density and photon fields and therefore, we can only see the
jet emission further out.

ionization also affects the character of the dead zones around the disk

and chemical effects of the stellar X-rays, their propagation through the disk
has to be calculated taking into account both absorption and scattering. To

previous work for the same physical parameters. It also updates them by
including a more detailed treatment of the radiative transfer and by using
ionizing spectra and elemental abundance more appropriate for what is currently
known about protoplanetary disks and their host stars. The new calculations for
a typical ionizing spectrum yield respectively lower and higher ionisation
rates at high and low column densities at a given radius in a disc. The
differences can be up to an order of magnitude near 1 AU, depending on the

model with an $U(1)_{R}$ symmetry, consisting of a single right handed neutrino
superfield with an appropriate R charge. The lepton number ($L$) of the
standard model fermions are identified with the negative of their R-charges. As
a result, a subset of leptonic R-parity violating operators can be present and
are consistent with the $U(1)_R$ symmetry. This model can produce one light
Dirac neutrino mass at the tree level without the need of introducing a very
small neutrino Yukawa coupling. We analyze the scalar sector of this model in
detail paying special attention to the mass of the lightest Higgs boson. One of
the sneutrinos might acquire a substantial vacuum expectation value leading to
interesting phenomenological consequences. Different sum rules involving the
physical scalar masses are obtained and we show that the lightest Higgs boson
mass receives a contribution proportional to the square of the neutrino Yukawa
coupling $f$. This allows for a 125 GeV Higgs boson at the tree level for $f
\sim {\cal O} (1)$ and still having a small tree level mass for the active
neutrino. In order to fit the experimental results involving neutrino masses
and mixing angles we introduce a small breaking of $U(1)_R$ symmetry, in the
context of anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking. In the presence of this
small R-symmetry breaking, light neutrino masses receive contributions at the
one-loop level involving the R-parity violating interactions. We also identify
the right handed sterile neutrino as a warm dark matter candidate in our model.
In the case of R-symmetry breaking, the large $f$ case is characterized by a
few hundred MeV lightest neutralino as an unstable lightest supersymmetric
particle (LSP) and we briefly discuss the cosmological implications of such a

implies that there could be a significant bias when inferring distances of SNe

this, linear perturbation theory predicts an effectively infinite variance in
the convergence for ultra-narrow beams. We attempt to quantify the effect

considering three alternative methods for estimating distances, in addition to

description on the past light cone: the null hypersurface on which observed

inhomogeneities in the determination of dark energy parameters, whose real
nature is still unknown and for which the influence of matter structures has
been proposed as a cosmological alternative. We start with the definition of a
""geodesic lightcone"" gauge simplifying greatly the study of light propagation
in the Universe. We then define a gauge invariant average of scalars on the
past light cone and compute the effect of inhomogeneities on the luminosity
flux by considering their power spectrum up to its non-linear regime. The
effect on the flux is negligible whereas observables like the luminosity
distance, computed at second order in perturbations, are much more affected. We
also study the distance modulus at the basis of the discovery of dark energy
from type Ia supernovae (SNe). The average of this modulus is only slightly
affected by inhomogeneities but its variance sensitively depends on them. These
results show, within their hypotheses, that an alternative to dark energy by an
effect of structures is impossible but, at the same time, emphasize their
importance on the dispersion of data in the Hubble diagram. The dominating
physical effects turn out to be peculiar velocity of SNe and weak lensing. Our
predictions on the dispersion are in very good agreement with first analyses
carried out so far to detect a signal of lensing among SNe Ia data and will be
testable in the near future.

matter) axisymmetric galaxy models, we study the evolution of the hot haloes in
a suite of flat ETGs of fixed mass distribution, but with variable amounts of
azimuthal velocity dispersion and rotational support, including the possibility
of a counter-rotating inner stellar disc. The hot halo is fed by stellar mass
losses and heated by SNIa explosions and thermalization of stellar motions. We
measure the value of the thermalization parameter gamma (the ratio between the
heating due to the relative velocity between the stellar streaming and the ISM
bulk flow, and the heating attainable by complete thermalization of the stellar
streaming motions). We find that 1) the X-ray emission and the average
temperature are larger in fully velocity dispersion supported systems; 2)
0.1<gamma<0.2 for isotropic rotators (with a trend for being larger for lower
dark mass models); 3) systems that are isotropic rotators at large radii with
an inner counter-rotating disc, or fully velocity dispersion supported systems
with an inner rotating disc, have gamma=1, again with a trend to increase for
lower dark mass contents. We also find that the lower X-ray luminosities of
isotropic rotators cannot be explained just by their low gamma, but are due to
the complicated flow structure, consequence of the angular momentum stored at
large radii. X-ray emission weighted temperatures and luminosities nicely match
observed values; the X-ray isophotes are boxy in case of significant galaxy
rotation. Overall, it is found that rotation has an important role to explain
the observational result that more rotationally supported ETGs on average show

study two fundamental questions of detection: first, given a snapshot view of a
(perhaps vanishingly small) fraction of those infected, under what conditions
is an epidemic spreading via contact (e.g., Influenza), distinguishable from a
""random illness"" operating independently of any contact network (e.g., seasonal
allergies); second, if we do have an epidemic, under what conditions is it
possible to determine which network of interactions is the main cause of the
spread -- the causative network -- without any knowledge of the epidemic, other
than the identity of a minuscule subsample of infected nodes?
  The core, therefore, of this paper, is to obtain an understanding of the
diagnostic power of network information. We derive sufficient conditions
networks must satisfy for these problems to be identifiable, and produce
efficient, highly scalable algorithms that solve these problems. We show that
the identifiability condition we give is fairly mild, and in particular, is
satisfied by two common graph topologies: the grid, and the Erdos-Renyi graphs.

inhomogeneous scalar perturbation of the form \alpha sin (\kappa z) and study
its effects on the matter density contrasts. Assuming an ideal fluid model we
calculate, in the linear regime, the contribution of the inhomogeneous mode to
the density contrast. We calculate the expected dipole in the LSS for two
cases, first assuming that the mode is still superhorizon everywhere, and
second assuming the mode is subhorizon, but has crossed the horizon deep in
matter domination and is subhorizon everywhere in the region of the survey
(NVSS). In both cases we find that such an inhomogeneous scalar perturbation is
sufficient to generate the reported values of dipole anisotropy in LSS. For the
superhorizon modes we find values which are consistent with both CMB and NVSS
results. We also predict signatures for the model which can be tested by future
observations.

in the field of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and has important applications

tackle this grand challenge thanks to experimental advances in preserving
quantum coherence of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center spins in diamond as a
sensitive probe and theoretical proposals on atomic-scale magnetometry via
dynamical decoupling control. Through decoherence measurement of NV centers
under dynamical decoupling control, sensing of single $^{13}\textbf{C}$ at
nanometer distance has been realized. Toward the ultimate goal of structure
analysis of single molecules, it is highly desirable to directly measure the
interactions within single nuclear spin clusters. Here we sensed a single
$^{13}\textbf{C}$-$^{13}\textbf{C}$ nuclear spin dimer located about 1 nm from
the NV center and characterized the interaction between the two nuclear spins,
by measuring NV center spin decoherence under various dynamical decoupling
control. From the measured interaction we derived the spatial configuration of
the dimer with atomic-scale resolution. These results demonstrate that central
spin decoherence under dynamical decoupling control is a feasible probe for NMR
structure analysis of single molecules.

suppress the development of the hydrodynamical bar-mode instability in
relativistic stars. The suppression is due to a change in the rest-mass density
and angular velocity profiles due to the formation and to the linear growth of
a toroidal component that rapidly overcomes the original poloidal one, leading
to an amplification of the total magnetic energy. The study is carried out
performing three-dimensional ideal-magnetohydrodynamics simulations in full
general relativity, superimposing to the initial (matter) equilibrium
configurations a purely poloidal magnetic field in the range $10^{14}-10^{16}$
G. When the seed field is a few parts in $10^{15}$ G or above, all the evolved
models show the formation of a low-density envelope surrounding the star. For
much weaker fields, no effect on the matter evolution is observed, while
magnetic fields which are just below the suppression threshold are observed to
slow down the growth-rate of the instability.

of the structure and dynamics of ""traditional"" core/periphery networks,
rich-clubs, nested, bow-tie and onion networks. Comparing core/periphery
structures with network modules, we discriminate between global and local
cores. The core/periphery network organization lies in the middle of several
extreme properties, such as random/condensed structures, clique/star
configurations, network symmetry/asymmetry, network
assortativity/disassortativity, as well as network hierarchy/anti-hierarchy.
These properties of high complexity together with the large degeneracy of core
pathways ensuring cooperation and providing multiple options of network flow
re-channelling greatly contribute to the high robustness of complex systems.
Core processes enable a coordinated response to various stimuli, decrease
noise, and evolve slowly. The integrative function of network cores is an
important step in the development of a large variety of complex organisms and
organizations. In addition to these important features and several decades of
research interest, studies on core/periphery networks still have a number of

partially resolved point source located at the northern tip of a radio ""tongue""
similar to the X-ray structure observed by Chandra. Behind the Cannonball, a
radio counterpart to the X-ray plume is observed. This object consists of a
broad radio plume with a size of 30\arcsec$\times$15\arcsec, followed by a
linear tail having a length of 30\arcsec. The compact head and broad plume
sources appear to have relatively flat spectra ($\propto\nu^\alpha$) with mean
values of $\alpha=-0.44\pm0.08$ and $-0.10\pm0.02$, respectively; and the
linear tail shows a steep spectrum with the mean value of $-1.94\pm0.05$. The
total radio luminosity integrated from these components is $\sim8\times10^{33}$
erg s$^{-1}$, while the emission from the head and tongue amounts for only
$\sim1.5\times10^{31}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Based on the images obtained from the two
epochs' observations at 5 GHz, we infer the proper motion of the object:
$\mu_\alpha = 0.001 \pm0.003$ arcsec yr$^{-1}$ and $\mu_\delta = 0.013
\pm0.003$ arcsec yr$^{-1}$. With an implied velocity of 500 km s$^{-1}$, a
plausible model can be constructed in which a runaway neutron star surrounded
by a pulsar wind nebula was created in the event that produced Sgr A East. The
inferred age of this object, assuming that its origin coincides with the center
of Sgr A East, is approximately 9000 years.

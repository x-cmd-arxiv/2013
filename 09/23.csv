universe, which stresses that both the duration and wavelength of the emitted
light from a distant object at the redshift $z$ will be dilated by a factor of
$1+z$ at the observer. By using a sample of 139 \emph{Swift} long GRBs with
known redshift ($z\leq8.2$), we measure the observed duration ($T_{90}$) in the
observed energy range between $140/(1+z)$ keV and $350/(1+z)$ keV,
corresponding to a fixed energy range of 140-350 keV in the rest frame. We
obtain a significant correlation between the duration and the factor $1+z$,
i.e., $T_{\rm{90}}=10.5(1+z)^{0.94\pm0.26}$, which is well consistent with that
expected from cosmological time dilation effect.

is a challenging subject. Those PDEs indeed show no dissipation effects and the
input of additional information in the model equations may introduce errors
that propagate and create shocks. We propose a new approach based on the
kinetic description of the conservation law. A kinetic equation is a first
order partial differential equation in which the advection velocity is a free
variable. In certain cases, it is possible to prove that the nonlinear
conservation law is equivalent to a linear kinetic equation. Hence, data
assimilation is carried out at the kinetic level, using a Luenberger observer
also known as the nudging strategy in data assimilation. Assimilation then
resumes to the handling of a BGK type equation. The advantage of this framework
is that we deal with a single ""linear"" equation instead of a nonlinear system
and it is easy to recover the macroscopic variables. The study is divided into
several steps and essentially based on functional analysis techniques. First we
prove the convergence of the model towards the data in case of complete
observations in space and time. Second, we analyze the case of partial and
noisy observations. To conclude, we validate our method with numerical results
on Burgers equation and emphasize the advantages of this method with the more
complex Saint-Venant system.

ago into Homo sapiens genetic pool from an archaic (Homo erectus) lineage and
rose to exceptionally high frequency of around 70 percent worldwide today. It
is involved in regulating neuroblast proliferation and its changes alter the
rate of division and/or differentiation of neuroblasts during the neurogenic
phase of embriogenesis, which could alter the size and structure of the
resulting brain.
  At the time of introgression, images had already been painted on the walls of
caves and speech has been in use for over 100,000 years, as had been abstract
thinking. Like today, reasoning and thinking were the primary faculties of
individuals. Homo erectus either did not possess those faculties or was
markedly inferior to Homo sapiens in them. Its brain was smaller and the cortex
was apparently less convoluted. Thus, introgressed microcephalin allele
directed neurogenesis evolutionary back to less complicated brain structure
typical for our evolutionary forefathers, slightly decreasing the level of
complexity already achieved by Homo sapiens 37,000 years ago. Despite that, it
proliferated at a rapid pace.
  It yields a supposition: 37,000 years ago the brains of Homo sapiens were too
big and too complicated for the kind of thinking needed for the highest fitness
of individuals. Since adaptation cannot by definition surpass selection
requirements, the volume and complication of the human brain did not originate
under selective pressure to improve effective thinking and they cannot be
explained in terms of such selection.
  A proposal to solve this quandary is presented, claiming that Homo sapiens
originated just by chance. Endurance running led to the emergence of Homo
sapiens. The human mind and larynx used for speech are side-effects of more
than a million years of endurance running by pre-human hunters.

  Society",,"10.1093/mnras/stt1631",,"astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This article presents a novel type of very long baseline astronomical
interferometer that uses the fluctuations, as a function of time, of the
intensity measured by a quadratic detector, which is a common type of
astronomical detector. The theory on which the technique is based is validated
by laboratory experiments. Its outstanding principal advantages comes from the
fact that the angular structure of an astronomical object is simply determined
from the visibility of the minima of the spectrum of the intensity fluctuations
measured by the detector, as a function of the frequency of the fluctuations,
while keeping the spacing between mirrors constant. This would allow a simple
setup capable of high angular resolutions because it could use an extremely
large baseline. Another major interest is that it allows for a more efficient
use of telescope time because observations at a single baseline are sufficient,
while amplitude and intensity interferometers need several observations at
different baselines. The fact that one does not have to move the telescopes
would also allow detecting faster time variations because having to move the
telescopes sets a lower limit to the time variations that can be detected. The
technique uses wave interaction effects and thus has some characteristics in
common with intensity interferometry. A disadvantage of the technique, like in
intensity interferometry, is that it needs strong sources if observing at high
frequencies (e.g. the visible). This is a minor disadvantage in the radio
region. At high frequencies, this disadvantage is mitigated by the fact that,
like in intensity interferometry, the requirements of the optical quality of
the mirrors used are far less severe than in amplitude interferometry so that
poor quality large reflectors (e.g. Cherenkov telescopes) can be used in the
optical region.

of a string T of length n, compute its k-th lexicographically smallest suffix.
This a natural generalization of the well-known question of computing the

We first revisit two special cases of the problem, introduced by Babenko,
Kolesnichenko and Starikovskaya [CPM'13], in which we are asked to compute the
minimal non-empty and the maximal suffixes of a substring. For the maximal
suffixes problem, we give a linear-space structure with O(1) query time and
linear preprocessing time, i.e., we manage to achieve optimal construction and
optimal query time simultaneously. For the minimal suffix problem, we give a
linear-space data structure with O(\tau) query time and O(n log n / \tau)
preprocessing time, where 1 <= \tau <= log n is a parameter of the data
structure. As a sample application, we show that this data structure can be
used to compute the Lyndon decomposition of any substring of T in O(k \tau)
time, where k is the number of distinct factors in the decomposition.
  Finally, we move to the general case of the substring suffix selection
problem, where using any combinatorial properties seems more difficult.
Nevertheless, we develop a linear-space data structure with O(log^{2+\epsilon}
n) query time.

""the best thermoelectric"". It follows however, that ""parasitic"" effects that
make the system deviate from the ideal limit, and reduce the efficiency from

parasitics, there are: parallel phonon conduction, finite width of the
electrons' transport band and more than a single energy transport channel. In
terms of a small parameter characterizing the deviation from the ideal limit,
the efficiency and power grow linearly, and the dissipation {\em
quadratically}. The results are generalized to the case of broken time-reversal

generally covariant scalars. It is assumed that Lagrangians depend on metric
tensor, curvature tensor, torsion tensor and its first and second covariant
derivatives, besides, on an arbitrary set of other tensor (matter) fields and
their first and second covariant derivatives. Thus, both the standard minimal
coupling with the Riemann-Cartan geometry and non-minimal coupling with the
curvature and torsion tensors are considered.
  The studies and results are as follow. (a) A physical interpretation of the
Noether and Klein identities is examined. It was found that they are the basis
for constructing equations of balance of energy-momentum tensors of various
types (canonical, metrical and Belinfante symmetrized). The equations of
balance are presented. (b) Using the generalized equations of balance, new
(generalized) manifestly generally covariant expressions for canonical
energy-momentum and spin tensors of the matter fields are constructed. In the
cases, when the matter Lagrangian contains both the higher derivatives and
non-minimal coupling with curvature and torsion, such generalizations are
non-trivial. (c) The Belinfante procedure is generalized for an arbitrary
Riemann-Cartan space. (d) A more convenient in applications generalized
expression for the canonical superpotential is obtained. (e) A total system of
equations for the gravitational fields and matter sources are presented in the
form more naturally generalizing the Einstein-Cartan equations with matter.
This result, being a one of more important results itself, is to be also a
basis for constructing physically sensible conservation laws and their
applications.

BCS-BEC crossover physics in the mass-balanced case, unphysically gives a
double-valued solution in terms of the superfluid phase transition temperature
$T_{\rm c}$ in the crossover region. To overcome this serious problem, we
include higher order strong-coupling corrections beyond the $T$-matrix level.
Using this extended $T$-matrix theory, we calculate single-particle excitations
in the normal state above $T_{\rm c}$. The so-called pseudogap phenomena
originating from pairing fluctuations are shown to be different between the
light mass component and heavy mass component, which becomes more remarkable at
higher temperatures. Since Fermi condensates with hetero-Cooper pairs have
recently been discussed in various fields, such as exciton (polariton)
condensates, as well as color superconductivity, our results would be useful
for the further development of Fermi superfluid physics, beyond the
conventional superfluid state with homo-Cooper pairs.

components in neutron electric dipole moment experiments. If a closed
three-dimensional boundary surface surrounding the fiducial volume of an
experiment can be defined such that its interior encloses no currents or
sources of magnetization, each of the interior vector field components and the
magnetic scalar potential will satisfy a Laplace equation. Therefore, if either
the vector field components or the normal derivative of the scalar potential
can be measured on the surface of this boundary, thus defining a Dirichlet or
Neumann boundary-value problem, respectively, the interior vector field
components or the scalar potential (and, thus, the field components via the
gradient of the potential) can be uniquely determined via solution of the
Laplace equation. We discuss the applicability of this technique to the
determination of the interior magnetic field components during the operating
phase of neutron electric dipole moment experiments when it is not, in general,
feasible to perform direct in situ measurements of the interior field
components. We also study the specifications that a vector field probe must
satisfy in order to determine the interior vector field components to a certain
precision. The technique we propose here may also be applicable to experiments
requiring monitoring of the vector magnetic field components within some closed
boundary surface, such as searches for neutron-antineutron oscillations along a
flight path or measurements in storage rings of the muon anomalous magnetic
moment $g-2$ and the proton electric dipole moment.

which the vertical structure is determined self-consistently by the balance of
heating due to dissipation of MHD turbulence driven by the magneto-rotational
instability (MRI), and cooling due to radiation emitted at the photosphere. The
calculations adopt the local shearing box approximation, and utilize the
recently developed radiation transfer module in the Athena MHD code based on a
variable Eddington tensor rather than an assumed local closure. After
saturation of the MRI, in many cases the disk maintains a steady vertical
structure for many thermal times. However, in every case in which the box size
in the horizontal directions is at least one pressure scale height,
fluctuations associated with MRI turbulence and dynamo action in the disk
eventually trigger a thermal runaway which causes the disk to either expand or
contract until the calculation must be terminated. During runaway, the
dependence of the heating and cooling rates on total pressure satisfy the
simplest criterion for classical thermal instability. We identify several
physical reasons why the thermal runaway observed in our simulations differ
from the standard alpha disk model, for example the advection of radiation
contributes a non-negligible fraction to the vertical energy flux at the
largest radiation pressure, most of the dissipation does not happen in the disk
mid-plane, and the change of dissipation scale height with mid-plane pressure
is slower than the change of density scale height. We discuss how and why our
results differ from those published previously. Such thermal runaway behavior
might have important implications for interpreting temporal variability in
observed systems, but fully global simulations are required to study the
saturated state before detailed predictions can be made.

propose a dynamic profiling based technique for saving cache leakage energy in
multitasking systems. Our technique uses a small coloring-based profiling
cache, to estimate performance and energy consumption of multiple cache
configurations and then selects the best (least-energy) configuration among
them. Our technique uses non-intrusive profiling and saves energy despite
intra-task and inter-task variations; thus, it is suitable for multitasking

requires multiple data sets for the purposes of training models, developing
techniques, and final evaluation. Therefore it becomes necessary to divide the
corpora used into the required data sets (divisions). This document details a
set of rules that have been defined to enable consistent divisions for old and

  Our techniques use self-tested graph states. In this regard we introduce two
important improvements over previous work. Specifically, we derive new error
bounds which scale polynomially with the size of the graph compared with
exponential dependence on the size of the graph in previous work. We also
extend the self-testing error bounds on measurements to a very general set
which includes the adaptive measurements used for measurement-based quantum
computation as a special case.

human learning, our main goal was to implement a similar mechanism in
supervised learning of artificial neural networks. The starting point in our
study was the observation that words should accompany the input vectors
included in the training set, thus extending the ANN input space. This had as
consequence the necessity to take into consideration a modified sigmoid
activation function for neurons in the first hidden layer (in agreement with a
specific MLP apartment structure), and also a modified version of the
Backpropagation algorithm, which allows using of unspecified (null) desired
output components. Following the belief that basic concepts should be tested on
simple examples, the previous mentioned mechanism was applied on both the XOR
problem and a didactic color case study. In this context, we noticed the
interesting fact that the ANN was capable to categorize all desired input
vectors in the absence of their corresponding words, even though the training
set included only word accompanied inputs, in both positive and negative
examples. Further analysis along applying this approach to more complex
scenarios is currently in progress, as we consider the proposed language-driven
algorithm might contribute to a better understanding of learning in humans,
opening as well the possibility to create a specific category of artificial
neural networks, with abstraction capabilities.

to change in order to improve the performance is now dominated by methods that
employ the material distribution concept. The typical methods of the topology
optimization based on the structural optimization of two phase composites are
the so-called variable density ones, like the SIMP (Solid Isotropic Material
with Penalization) and the BESO (Bi-directional Evolutional Structure
Optimization). The topology optimization problem refers to the saddle-point
variation one as well as the so-called Stokes flow problem of the compressive
fluid. The checkerboard patterns often appear in the results computed by the
SIMP and the BESO in which the Q1-P0 element is used for FEM (Finite Element
Method), since these patterns are more favourable than uniform density regions.
Computational experiments of SIMP and BESO have shown that filtering of
sensitivity information of the optimization problem is a highly efficient way
that the checkerboard patterns disappeared and to ensure mesh-independency. SIn
this paper, we discuss the theoretical basis for the filtering method of the
SIMP and the BESO and as a result, the filtering method can be understood by
the theorem of partition of unity and the convolution operator of low-pass
filter.

problem. This problem can be reduced to finding the largest eigenvalue and the
corresponding eigenvector for Davenport's $K$-matrix. Several iterative
algorithms, such as QUEST and FOMA, were proposed, aiming at reducing the
computational cost. But their computational time is unpredictable because the
iteration number is not fixed and the solution is not accurate in theory.
Recently, an analytical solution, ESOQ was suggested. The advantages of
analytical solutions are that their computational time is fixed and the
solution should be accurate in theory if there is no numerical error. In this
paper, we propose a different analytical solution to the Wahba's problem. We
use simple and easy to be verified examples to show that this method is
numerically more stable than ESOQ, potentially faster than QUEST and FOMA. We
also use extensive simulation test to support this claim.

its author(s) but also to the journal publishing it. Scientists, either
proficient or tender, usually submit their most important work to prestigious
journals which receives higher citations than the ordinary. How to model the
role of scientific journals in citation dynamics is of great importance. In
this paper we address this issue through two folds. One is the intrinsic
heterogeneity of a paper determined by the impact factor of the journal
publishing it. The other is the mechanism of a paper being cited which depends
on its citations and prestige. We develop a model for citation networks via an
intrinsic nodal weight function and an intuitive ageing mechanism. The node's
weight is drawn from the distribution of impact factors of journals and the
ageing transition is a function of the citation and the prestige. The
node-degree distribution of resulting networks shows nonuniversal scaling: the
distribution decays exponentially for small degree and has a power-law tail for
large degree, hence the dual behaviour. The higher the impact factor of the
journal, the larger the tipping point and the smaller the power exponent that
are obtained. With the increase of the journal rank, this phenomenon will fade
and evolve to pure power laws.

Quantum Chromodynamic (QCD) phase diagram. The products of the moments, S\sigma
and \kappa\sigma^{2}, are sensitive to the correlation length of the hot and
dense medium created in the collisions and are related to the ratios of baryon
number susceptibilities of corresponding orders. The products of moments are
found to have values significantly below the Skellam expectation and close to
expectations based on independent proton and anti-proton production. The

topological manifolds can be assigned. It follows, from consideration of
homotopy, that different sorts of topological defects will be stable in each
manifold. For instance, Skyrmionic texture is believed to be a stable
topological object in two-dimensional AFM spin-1 condensate. Countering such
common perceptions, here we show on the basis of a new wave function
decomposition scheme that there is no physical parameter regime wherein the
temporal dynamics of spin-1 condensate can be described solely within AFM or FM
manifold. Initial state of definite topological number prepared entirely within
one particular phase must immediately evolve into a mixed state. Accordingly,
the very notion of topology and topological stability within the sub-manifold
of AFM or FM become invalid. Numerical simulation reveals the linear Zeeman
effect to be an efficient catalyst to extract the alternate component from an
initial topological object prepared entirely within one particular
sub-manifold, serving as a potential new tool for ""topology engineering"" in

rate $\lambda$ per slot to the transmitter queue. We assume that the
transmitter can control the number of packets served in a slot by varying the
transmit power for the slot. We restrict to transmitter scheduling policies
that are monotone and stationary, i.e., the number of packets served is a
non-decreasing function of the queue length at the beginning of the slot for
every slot fade state. For such policies, we obtain asymptotic lower bounds for
the minimum average delay of the packets, when average transmitter power is a
small positive quantity $V$ more than the minimum average power required for
transmitter queue stability. We show that the minimum average delay grows
either to a finite value or as $\Omega\brap{\log(1/V)}$ or $\Omega\brap{1/V}$
when $V \downarrow 0$, for certain sets of values of $\lambda$. These sets are
determined by the distribution of fading gain, the maximum number of packets
which can be transmitted in a slot, and the transmit power function of the
fading gain and the number of packets transmitted that is assumed. We identify
a case where the above behaviour of the tradeoff differs from that obtained
from a previously considered approximate model, in which the random queue
length process is assumed to evolve on the non-negative real line, and the
transmit power function is strictly convex. We also consider a fading
point-to-point link, where the transmitter, in addition to controlling the
number of packets served, can also control the number of packets admitted in
every slot. Our approach, which uses bounds on the stationary probability
distribution of the queue length, also leads to an intuitive explanation of the
asymptotic behaviour of average delay in the regime where $V \downarrow 0$.

they become alternatives in building software system. Despite many failures in
these projects, there are some success stories with one of the identified
success factors is modularity. This paper presents the first quantitative
software metrics to measure modularity level of Java-based OSS Projects called
Modularity Index. This software metrics is formulated by analyzing modularity
traits such as size, complexity, cohesion, and coupling of 59 Java-based OSS
Projects from sourceforge.net using SONAR tool. These OSS Projects are selected
since they have been downloaded more than 100K times and believed to have the
required modularity trait to be successful. The software metrics related to
modularity in class, package and system level of these projects are extracted
and analyzed. The similarities found are then analyzed to determine the class
quality, package quality, and then combined with system architecture measure to
formulate the Modularity Index. The case study of measuring Modularity Index
during the evolution of JFreeChart project has shown that this software metrics
is able to identify strengths and potential problems of the project.

through electrochemical measurements in the electrode made of multiferroic
Bismuth Ferrite (BFO) in the form of nanorods protruding out. These BFO
nanorods were developed on porous Anodised Alumina (AAO) templates using wet
chemical technique. Diameters of nanorods were in the range of 20-100 nm. The
high capacitance is attributed to the nanostructure. The active surface charge
has been evaluated electrochemically by cyclic voltammetry (CV) at different
scanning rates and charge-discharge studies. The specific capacitances were
constant after several cycles of charge-discharge leading to their useful
application in devices. The mechanism of accumulation of charge on the
electrode surface has been studied.

cold dark matter (CDM) to the second-order perturbations in all cosmological
scales including the super-horizon scale. The proof is made in the
axion-comoving gauge. For a canonical mass, the axion pressure term causes
deviation from the CDM only on scales smaller than the Solar System size.
Beyond such a small scale the equations of the axion fluid are the same as the
ones of the CDM based on the CDM-comoving gauge which are exactly identical to
the Newtonian equations to the second order. We also show that the axion fluid
does not generate the rotational (vector-type) perturbation even to the second
order. Thus, in the case of axion fluid, we have the relativistic/Newtonian
correspondence to the second order, even considering the rotational
perturbation. Our analysis is made in the presence of the cosmological
constant, and can be easily extended to the realistic situation including other
components of fluids and fields.

monotonicity of combinatorial sequences. (1) A criterion for the monotonicity
of the function $\sqrt[x]{f(x)}$ is given, which is a continuous analog for one
result of Wang and Zhu. (2) The log-behavior of the functions
$\theta(x)=\sqrt[x]{2 \zeta(x)\Gamma(x+1)}$ and
$F(x)=\sqrt[x]{\frac{\Gamma(ax+b+1)}{\Gamma(c x+d+1)\Gamma(e x+f+1)}}$ is
considered, where $\zeta(x)$ and $\Gamma(x)$ are the Riemann zeta function and
the Euler Gamma function, respectively. As consequences, the strict
log-concavities of the function $\theta(x)$ (a conjecture of Chen {\it et al.})
and $\{\sqrt[n]{z_n}\}$ for some combinatorial sequences (including the
Bernoulli numbers, the Tangent numbers, the Catalan numbers, the Fuss-Catalan

contains some results of Chen {\it et al.}, Luca and St\u{a}nic\u{a}. (3). By
researching logarithmically complete monotonicity of some functions, the
infinite log-monotonicity of the sequence
$\{\frac{(n_{0}+ia)!}{(k_0+ib)!(\overline{k_0}+i\overline{b})!}\}_{i\geq0}$ is
proved. This generalizes two results of Chen {\it et al.} that both the Catalan

$\binom{2n}{n}$ are infinitely log-monotonic and strengths one result of Su and
Wang that $\binom{dn}{\delta n}$ is log-convex in $n$. (4) The asymptotically

These fields serve as order parameters for superfluidity (quantum phase
coherence over macroscopic distances), making the entire universe a superfluid.
We review a mathematical model consisting of two aspects: (a) emergence of the
superfluid during the big bang; (b) observable manifestations of superfluidity
in the present universe. The creation aspect requires a self-interacting scalar
field that is asymptotically free, i.e., the interaction must grow from zero
during the big bang, and this singles out the Halpern-Huang potential, which
has exponential behavior for large fields. It leads to an equivalent
cosmological constant that decays like a power law, and this gives dark energy
without ""fine-tuning"". Quantum turbulence (chaotic vorticity) in the early
universe was able to create all the matter in the universe, fulfilling the
inflation scenario. In the present universe, the superfluid can be
phenomenologically described by a nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation. It predicts
halos around galaxies with higher superfluid density, which is perceived as
dark matter through gravitational lensing. In short, dark energy is the energy
density of the cosmic superfluid, and dark matter arises from local
fluctuations of the superfluid density.

Gaussian distribution as their total number tends to infinity. However, for a
class of positive random variables, we find that the sum tends faster to a
log-normal distribution. Although the sum tends eventually to a Gaussian
distribution, the distribution of the sum is always close to a log-normal
distribution rather than to any Gaussian distribution if the summands are
numerous enough. This is in contrast to the current consensus that any
log-normal distribution is due to a product of random variables, i.e., a
multiplicative process, or equivalently to nonlinearity of the system. In fact,
the log-normal distribution is also observable for a sum, i.e., an additive
process that is typical of linear systems. We show conditions for such a sum,
an analytical example, and an application to random scalar fields such as of
turbulence.

provide a fully quantized treatment of self-contained (autonomous) heat
machines, as opposed to their prevailing semiclassical description that
consists of a quantum system alternately coupled to a hot or a cold heat bath,
and parametrically driven by a classical time-dependent piston or field. Here
by contrast, there is no external time-dependent driving. Instead, the
evolution is caused by the stationary simultaneous interaction of two heat
baths (having distinct spectra and temperatures) with a single two-level system
that is in turn coupled to the quantum piston.
  The fully quantized treatment we put forward allows us to investigate work
extraction and refrigeration by the tools of quantum-optical amplifier and
dissipation theory, particularly, by the analysis of amplified or dissipated
phase-plane quasiprobability distributions. Our main insight is that quantum
states may be thermodynamic resources and can provide a powerful handle, or
control, on the efficiency of the heat machine. In particular, a piston
initialized in a coherent state can cause the engine to produce work at an
efficiency above the Carnot bound in the linear amplification regime. In the
refrigeration regime, the coefficient of performance can transgress the Carnot
bound if the piston is initialized in a Fock state. The piston may be realized
by a vibrational mode, as in nanomechanical setups, or an electromagnetic field
mode, as in cavity-based scenarios.

multi-scale entropy denoising procedure to remove the noise contained in the
final reconstruction, that arises mostly from the random intrinsic shape of the
galaxies. The second and third methods are based on a model of the density
field made of a multi-scale grid of radial basis functions. In one case, the
model parameters are computed with a linear inversion involving a singular
value decomposition. In the other case, the model parameters are estimated
using a Bayesian MCMC optimization implemented in the lensing software

fields. We pay particular attention to the errors estimated with resampling. We
find the multi-scale grid model optimized with MCMC to provide the best
results, but at high computational cost, especially when considering
resampling. The SVD method is much faster but yields noisy maps, although this
can be mitigated with resampling. The FLens method is a good compromise with
fast computation, high signal to noise reconstruction, but lower resolution
maps. All three methods are applied to the MACS J0717+3745 galaxy cluster

intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) in the haloes of galaxies. Jet radio
emission is expected from a sub-Eddington accreting IMBH in the low/hard (radio
bright) state. In a search for such IMBH jet radio emission, we have observed
with the Very Large Array (VLA) at 5 GHz a sample of seven extreme ULXs whose
X-ray properties indicate they are in the hard state. Assuming they remain in
this state, the non-detection of radio emission for six of the target sources
allows us to constrain their black hole mass to the IMBH regime, thus ruling
out a supermassive black hole nature. For the extreme ULX in the galaxy
NGC\,2276, we detect extended radio emission formed by two lobes of total flux
density 1.43 $\pm$ 0.22 mJy and size $\sim$650 pc. The X-ray counterpart is
located between the two lobes, suggesting the presence of a black hole with jet
radio emission. The radio luminosity allows us to constrain the black hole mass
of this source to the IMBH regime; hence, the extreme ULX in NGC\,2276 could be
the first detection of extended jet radio emission from an IMBH. The radio
emission could also possibly come from a radio nebula powered by the ULX with a
minimum total energy of $5.9 \times 10^{52}$ erg, thus constituting the most
powerful and largest ULX radio nebula ever observed.

with the heavy-to-light transition form factors (TFFs). Firstly, we adopt the
improved LCSR approach to deal with the $B\to D$ TFF $f^{+}(q^2)$ up to twist-4
accuracy. Due to the elimination of the most uncertain twist-3 contribution and
the large suppression of the twist-4 contribution, the obtained LCSR shall
provide us a good platform for testing the $D$-meson leading-twist DA. For the
purpose, we suggest a new model for the $D$-meson leading-twist DA
($\phi_{3D}$), whose longitudinal behavior is dominantly determined by a
parameter $B$. Moreover, we find its second Gegenbauer moment $a^D_2\sim B$.
Varying $B$ within certain region, one can conveniently mimic the $D$-meson DA
behavior suggested in the literature. Inversely, by comparing the estimations
with the experimental data on the $D$-meson involved processes, one can get a
possible range for the parameter $B$ and a determined behavior for the
$D$-meson DA. Secondly, we discuss the $B\to D$ TFF at the maximum recoil
region and present a detailed comparison of it with the pQCD estimation and the
experimental measurements. Thirdly, by applying the LCSR on $f^{+}(q^2)$, we
study the CKM matrix element $\Vcb$ together with its uncertainties by adopting
two types of processes, i.e. the $B^0/\bar{B}^0$-type and the $B^{\pm}$-type.
It is noted that a smaller $B \precsim 0.20$ shows a better agreement with the

customary, one can write $$q(x+y) = q(x) + q(y)+ b(x,y),$$ where $b$ is a

companion bilinear form need not be uniquely defined. Nevertheless, $q$ can

$\kappa$ is quasilinear in the sense that $\kappa(x+y) = \kappa(x) +
\kappa(y),$ and $\rho$ is rigid in the sense that it has a unique companion. In
case that $R$ is a supersemifield (cf. Definition 4.1 below) and $q$ is defined
on a free $R$-module, we obtain an explicit classification of these
decompositions $q = \kappa + \rho $ and of all companions $b$ of $q$.
  As an application to tropical geometry, given a quadratic form $q: V \to R$

particular in the frequency range of the band gap. We propose a new point of
view on the band gap, which we consider to be the result of vacuum fluctuations
in free space that tunnel in the forbidden range in the crystal. As a result,
we arrive at a model for the LDOS that is in two major items modified compared
to the well-known expression for infinite crystals. Firstly, we modify the
Dirac delta functions to become Lorentzians with a width set by the crystal
size. Secondly, building on characterization of the fields versus frequency and
position we calculated the fields in the band gap. We start from the fields at
the band edges, interpolated in space and position, and incorporating the
exponential damping in the band gap. We compare our proposed model to exact
calculations in one dimension using the transfer matrix method and find very
good agreement. Notably, we find that in finite crystals, the LDOS depends on
frequency, on position, and on crystal size, in stark contrast to the
well-known results for infinite crystals.

to the opening a new observational window on the Universe. In particular, the
Einstein Telescope (ET) is designed to have a fantastic sensitivity that will
provide with tens or hundreds of thousand NS-NS inspiral events per year up to
the redshift z = 2. Some of such events should be gravitationally lensed by
intervening galaxies. We explore the prospects of observing gravitationally
lensed inspiral NS-NS events in the Einstein telescope. Being conservative we
consider the lens population of elliptical galaxies. It turns out that
depending on the local insipral rate ET should detect from one per decade
detection in the pessimistic case to a tens of detections per year for the most
optimistic case. The detection of gravitationally lensed source in
gravitational wave detectors would be an invaluable source of information con-
cerning cosmography, complementary to standard ones (like supernovae or BAO)
independent of the local cosmic distance ladder calibrations.

understand the quality factors (Q) of nanomechanical resonators and
nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS), as well as actual experiments with
suspended atomic chains and molecular junctions. We consider a finite atomic
chain which is coupled to a zero-temperature outer environment, modeled as two
additional semi-infinite chains, thus inducing ""clamping-losses"". Weak coupling
to the outer environment ensures that the clamping losses are small, and that
the initially discrete nature of the phonon spectrum is approximately
maintained. We then consider a phonon damping process known as ""Landau-Rumer
damping"", where phonons in the excited mode of vibration decay into other modes
through anharmonic phonon-phonon interaction. The approximately discrete nature
of the phonon spectrum leads to sharp nonmonotonic changes in Q as parameters
are varied, and to the appearance of resonances in the damping. The latter
correspond to the existence of decay processes where the participating phonons
approximately conserve energy. We explore means to control the damping by
changing either the number of atoms in the chains or the ratio between the
longitudinal and transverse speeds of sound, thereby suggesting future
experiments to observe this resonance-like behavior.

isotopologues towards B1b. Both molecules from the nitrogen hydride family,
i.e. N2H+ and NH3, and from the nitrile family, i.e. HCN, HNC and CN, are
considered in the analysis. As a first step, we model the continuum emission in
order to derive the physical structure of the cloud, i.e. gas temperature and
H2 density. These parameters are subsequently used as an input in a non-local
radiative transfer model to infer the radial abundances profiles of the various
molecules. Our modeling shows that all the molecules are affected by depletion
onto dust grains, in the region that encompasses the B1-bS and B1-bN cores.
While high levels of deuterium fractionation are derived, we conclude that no
fractionation occurs in the case of the nitrogen chemistry. Independently of
the chemical family, the molecular abundances are consistent with 14N/15N~300,
a value representative of the elemental atomic abundances of the parental gas.
The inefficiency of the 15N-fractionation effects in the B1b region can be
linked to the relatively high gas temperature ~17K which is representative of
the innermost part of the cloud. Since this region shows signs of depletion
onto dust grains, we can not exclude the possibility that the molecules were
previously enriched in 15N, earlier in the B1b history, and that such an
enrichment could have been incorporated into the ice mantles. It is thus
necessary to repeat this kind of study in colder sources to test such a
possibility.

Chaplygin gas model. For $\rho\rightarrow \rho_P$, it reduces to p=-\rho c^2
leading to a phase of early accelerated expansion (early inflation) with a
constant density equal to the Planck density \rho_P (vacuum energy). For
$\rho_{\Lambda}\ll\rho\ll \rho_P$, we recover the standard linear equation of
state p=\alpha \rho c^2 describing radiation (\alpha=1/3) or pressureless
matter (\alpha=0) and leading to an intermediate phase of decelerating
expansion. For $\rho\rightarrow \rho_{\Lambda}$, we get p=-\rho c^2 leading to
a phase of late accelerated expansion (late inflation) with a constant density
equal to the cosmological density \rho_{\Lambda} (dark energy). We show a nice
symmetry between the early universe (vacuum energy + \alpha-fluid) and the late
universe (\alpha-fluid + dark energy). In our model, they are described by two
polytropic equations of state with index n=+1 and n=-1 respectively.
Furthermore, the Planck density \rho_P in the early universe plays a role
similar to the cosmological density \rho_{\Lambda} in the late universe. They
represent fundamental upper and lower density bounds differing by 122 orders of
magnitude. This quadratic equation of state leads to a fully analytical model
describing the evolution of the universe from the early inflation (Planck era)
to the late accelerated expansion (de Sitter era). These two phases are bridged

any singularity at t=0 and exists eternally in the past. It admits a scalar

string theory with flat background and constant H-flux. After an odd number of
T-dualities, correlation functions allow to extract a three-product having a
pattern similar to the Moyal-Weyl product. We then focus on the target space
and the local appearance of the various fluxes. An algebra based on vector
fields is proposed, whose structure functions are given by the fluxes.
Jacobi-identities for vector fields allow for the computation of
Bianchi-identities. Based on the latter, we give a proof for a special Courant
algebroid structure on the generalized tangent bundle, where the fluxes are
realized by the commutation relations of a basis of sections. As reviewed in
the first part of this work, in the description of non-geometric Q- and
R-fluxes, the B-field gets replaced by a bi-vector \beta, which is supposed to
serve as the dual object to B under T-duality. A natural question is about the
existence of a differential geometric framework allowing the construction of
actions manifestly invariant under coordinate- and gauge transformations, which
couple the \beta-field to gravity. It turns out that Lie algebroids are the
right language to answer this question positively. We conclude by giving an
outlook on future directions.

restrict our analysis to the regime of strong coupling to the environment, to
the antiadiabatic region, and to the subspace with zero value for $S^z_T$ (the
z-component of the total spin). In the case where each spin is coupled to a
different phonon bath, we assume that the system and the environment are
initially uncorrelated (and form a simply separable state) in the polaronic
frame of reference. By analyzing the {polaron} dynamics through non-Markovian
quantum master equation, we find that the system manifests a small amount of
decoherence that decreases both with increasing non-adiabaticity and with
enhancing strength of coupling; whereas, under the Markovian approximation, the
polaronic system exhibits a decoherence free behavior. For the situation where
both spins are coupled to the same phonon bath, we also show that the system is
decoherence free in the subspace where $S^z_T$ is fixed. To suppress
decoherence through quantum control, we employ a train of pi pulses and
demonstrate that unitary evolution of the system can be retained. We propose
realization of a weakly decohering charge qubit from an electron in an

  VM Migration",,,,,"cs.DC cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper investigates the opportunities and limitations of adaptive virtual
machine (VM) migration to reduce communication costs in a virtualized
environment. We introduce a new formal model for the problem of online VM
migration in two scenarios: (1) VMs can be migrated arbitrarily in the
substrate network; e.g., a private cloud provider may have an incentive to
reduce the overall communication cost in the network. (2) VMs can only be
migrated within a given tenant; e.g., a user that was assigned a set of
physical machines may exchange the functionality of the VMs on these machines.
  We propose a simple class of Destination-Swap algorithms which are based on
an aggressive collocation strategy (inspired by splay datastructures) and which
maintain a minimal and local amount of per-node (amortized cost) information to
decide where to migrate a VM and how; thus, the algorithms react quickly to
changes in the load. The algorithms come in two main flavors, an indirect and
distributed variant which keeps existing VM placements local, and a direct
variant which keeps the number of affected VMs small.
  We show that naturally, inter-tenant optimizations yield a larger potential
for optimization, but generally also a tenant itself can improve its embedding.
Moreover, there exists an interesting tradeoff between direct and indirect
strategies: indirect variants are preferable under skewed and sparse
communication patterns due to their locality properties.

physical conditions of the shock-excited gas in jets driven by pre-main
sequence stars. We have analyzed the 300-2500 nm X-shooter spectra of two jets
driven by the pre-main sequence stars ESO-Halpha 574 and Par-Lup 3-4. Both
spectra are very rich in [FeII] lines over the whole spectral range; in
addition, lines from [FeIII] are detected in the ESO-H\alpha 574 spectrum. NLTE
codes along with codes for the ionization equilibrium are used to derive the
gas excitation conditions of electron temperature and density, and fractional
ionization. The iron gas-phase abundance is provided by comparing the iron
lines emissivity with that of [OI] 630 nm. The [FeII] lines indicate ESO-Halpha
574 jet is, on average, colder (T_e = 9000 K), less dense (n_e = 2 10^4 cm^-3)
and more ionized (x_e = 0.7) than the Par-Lup 3-4 jet (T_e = 13000 K, n_e = 6
10^4 cm^-3, x_e < 0.4), even if the existence of a higher density component
(n_e = 2 10^5 cm^-3) is probed by the [FeIII] and [FeII] ultra-violet lines.
Theoretical models suggest that the shock at work in ESO-Halpha 574 is faster
and likely more energetic than the Par-Lup 3-4 shock. This latter feature is
confirmed by the high percentage of gas-phase iron measured in ESO-Halpha 574
(50-60% of its solar abundance in comparison with less than 30% in Par-Lup
3-4), which testifies that the ESO-Halpha 574 shock is powerful enough to
partially destroy the dust present inside the jet. This work demonstrates that
a multiline Fe analysis can be effectively used to probe the excitation and
ionization conditions of the gas in a jet without any assumption on ionic
abundances. The main limitation on the diagnostics resides in the large
uncertainties of the atomic data, which, however, can be overcome through a
statistical approach involving many lines.

determine phenotypic features. We address this fundamental problem in a class

calculation of mesoscopic properties from the knowledge of microscopic
Markovian transition probabilities. We show how exact analytic formulae for the
first and second moments of resident time distributions in mesostates can be
derived from microscopic resident times and transition probabilities even for
systems with a large number of microstates. We apply our formalism to models of
the inositol trisphosphate receptor, which plays a key role in generating
calcium signals triggering a wide variety of cellular responses. We demonstrate
how experimentally accessible quantities, such as opening and closing times and
the coefficient of variation of inter-spike intervals, and other, more
elaborated, quantities can be analytically calculated from the underlying
microscopic Markovian dynamics. A virtue of our approach is that we do not need
to follow the detailed time evolution of the whole system, as we derive the
relevant properties of its steady state without having to take into account the
often extremely complicated transient features. We emphasize that our formulae
fully agree with results obtained by stochastic simulations and approaches
based on a full determination of the microscopic system's time evolution. We
also illustrate how experiments can be devised to discriminate between
alternative molecular models of the inositol trisphosphate receptor. The
developed approach is applicable to any system described by a Markov process
and, owing to the analytic nature of the resulting formulae, provides an easy
way to characterize also rare events that are of particular importance to
understand the intermittency properties of complex dynamic systems.

Millisecond X-ray Pulsar XTE J1814-338, carrying out multiband (BVR) orbital
phase-resolved photometry using the ESO VLT/FORS2. The optical light curves are
consistent with a sinusoidal variability modulated with the orbital period,
showing evidence for a strongly irradiated companion star, in agreement with
previous findings. The observed colours cannot be accounted for by the
companion star alone, suggesting the presence of an accretion disc during
quiescence. The system is fainter in all analysed bands compared to previous
observations. The R band light curve displays a possible phase offset with
respect to the B and V band. Through a combined fit of the multi-band light
curves we derive constraints on the companion star and disc fluxes, on the
system distance and on the companion star mass. The irradiation luminosity
required to account for the observed day-side temperature of the companion star
is consistent with the spin-down luminosity of a millisecond radio pulsar. The
flux decrease and spectral evolution of the quiescent optical emission observed
comparing our data with previous observations, collected over 5 years, cannot
be well explained with the contribution of an irradiated companion star and an
accretion disc alone. The progressive flux decrease as the system gets bluer
could be due to a continuum component evolving towards a lower, bluer spectrum.
While most of the continuum component is likely due to the disc, we do not
expect it to become bluer in quiescence. Hence we hypothesize that an
additional component, such as synchrotron emission from a jet was contributing
significantly in the earlier data obtained during quiescence and then
progressively fading or moving its break frequency toward longer wavelengths.

for the choice of transition metals (M) are clusters' stability,

and the spin-susceptibility spectra are mainly determined by, in decreasing
order of importance: 1) the cage shape, 2) the group in the Periodic Table M
belongs to, and 3) the period of M in the Periodic Table. Cages with similar
structures and metal species that are close to each other in the Periodic Table
possess spectra sharing many similarities, e. g., the optical absorption
spectra of the MSi$_{12}$ (M = V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, and W), which are highly
symmetric and belong to groups 4 and 5 of the Periodic Table, all share a very
distinctive peak at around 4 eV. In all cases, although some of the observed
transitions are located at the Si skeleton of the cages, the transition metal
specie is always significant for the optical absorption and the
spin-susceptibility spectra. Our results provide finger-print data for

relies on the fact that all orderings are equiprobable under independent and

manifest in the form of open strings of cooperatively moving particles through

annihilation of a vacancy-interstitial pair. Surprisingly, we find that the
same collective events occur in crystals which are excited by thermal
fluctuations alone; a large thermal agitation inside the crystal lattice can
trigger the irreversible displacements of hundreds of particles. Our results
illustrate how local stresses can induce large scale cooperative dynamics in

quark system in $e^{+}e^{-}$ annihilation are briefly reviewed. A special
colour connection of four heavy quark system without colour-separation favours
the production of doubly heavy baryons. For the related three-jet case, the
corresponding hadronization has not been considered. We argue that it can be
effectively described as two string fragmentation besides the leading heavy
diquark fragmentation. The production rate and the properties of final state
hadron systems are discussed. Emphasis is on the string effect as a finger
print of this hadronization procedure.

situation, the magicity of doubly-magic $^{56,68,78}$Ni, and the coexistence of
spherical and strongly deformed shapes. Regarding the last point, strong
deformation and change of shell structure can take place simultaneously, being
driven by the combination of the tensor force and changes of major

provide the energy for much of the activity seen in the solar corona, such as
flares, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), etc. To overcome the unavailability of
coronal magnetic field measurements, photospheric magnetic field vector data
can be used to reconstruct the coronal field. Currently there are several
modelling techniques being used to calculate three-dimension of the field lines
into the solar atmosphere. For the first time, synoptic maps of photospheric
vector magnetic field synthesized from Vector Spectromagnetograph (VSM) on
Synoptic Optical Long-term Investigations of the Sun (SOLIS) are used to model
the coronal magnetic field and estimate free magnetic energy in the global
scale. The free energy (i.e., the energy in excess of the potential field
energy) is one of the main indicators used in space weather forecasts to
predict the eruptivity of active regions. We solve the nonlinear force-free
field equations using optimization principle in spherical geometry. The
resulting three-dimensional magnetic fields are used to estimate the magnetic
free energy content E_{free}=E_{nlfff}-E_{pot}, i.e., the difference of the
magnetic energies between the nonpotential field and the potential field in the
global solar corona. For comparison, we overlay the extrapolated magnetic field
lines with the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations by the Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly on board SDO. For a single Carrington rotation 2121, we find
that the global NLFFF magnetic energy density is 10.3% higher than the
potential one. Most of this free energy is located in active regions.

Feynman-Vernon formalism, we compute the influence functional holographically

thereby obtain the dynamics of the system's density matrix.
  We present two exactly solvable examples: (1) a straight string in a BTZ
black hole and (2) a scalar probe in AdS$_5$. We prepare an initial state that
mimics Schr\""odinger's cat and identify different stages of its decoherence
process using the time-scaling behaviors of R\'enyi entropy. We also relate
decoherence to local quantum quenches, and by comparing the time evolution
behaviors of the Wigner function and R\'enyi entropy we demonstrate that the
relaxation of local quantum excitations leads to the collapse of its
wave-function.

Mobile Ad hoc Networks built along a highway in a city environment or people in
a particular location. Mobile Nodes in Mobile Ad hoc Networks are usually
laptops, Personal Digital Assistants or mobile phones. These devices may use
Blue-tooth and/or IEEE 802.11 network interfaces and communicate in a
decentralized manner. Mobility is a key feature of Mobile Ad hoc Networks. Each
node may work as a router and the network can dynamically change with time;
when new nodes can join, and other nodes can leave the network. This paper
presents comparative results that have been carried out via Matrix lab software
simulation. The study investigates the impact of mobile nodes parameters such
as the speed, the arrival rate and the size of mobile nodes in a given area
using Poisson distribution. The results have indicated that mobile nodes
arrival rates may have influence on Mobile Nodes population (as a larger

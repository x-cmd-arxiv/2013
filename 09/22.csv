granulation and of small-scale magnetic features depend on the amount of
magnetic flux of the region they are embedded in. We analyze results from
numerical Hydro and Magneto Hydrodynamic simulations characterized by different
amount of average magnetic flux and find qualitatively the same differences as
those reported from observations. We show that these different physical
properties result from the inhibition of convection induced by the presence of
the magnetic field, which changes the temperature stratification of both quiet
and magnetic regions. Our results are relevant for solar irradiance variations
studies, as such differences are still not properly taken into account in
irradiance reconstruction models.

\tau\bar \mu, \tau\bar e and \mu\bar e in photon-photon collision at the

  In this paper, we consider the contributions of the \phi^\pm and

\gamma\gamma\to l_i\bar l_j (i, j= e, \mu, \tau, i\neq j) and find that they

violating processes \gamma\gamma\to l_i\bar l_j (i, j= e, \mu,\tau,i\neq j)
occur at a high rate due to the large mixing angle and the large flavor
changing coupling, so, in view of the low standard model backgrounds, they may
reach the detectable level of the ILC for a large part of the parameter space.
Since the rates predicted by the standard model are far below the detectable
level, these processes may serve as a sensitive probe for such new physics
models.

simulate the web browsing experience by smoothly transitioning between archived
pages. During this process, the target datetime changes with each link
followed; drifting away from the datetime originally selected. When browsing
sparsely-archived pages, this nearly-silent drift can be many years in just a
few clicks. We conducted 200,000 acyclic walks of archived pages, following up
to 50 links per walk, comparing the results of two target datetime policies.
The Sliding Target policy allows the target datetime to change as it does in
archive UIs such as the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine. The Sticky Target
policy, represented by the Memento API, keeps the target datetime the same
throughout the walk. We found that the Sliding Target policy drift increases
with the number of walk steps, number of domains visited, and choice (number of
links available). However, the Sticky Target policy controls temporal drift,
holding it to less than 30 days on average regardless of walk length or number
of domains visited. The Sticky Target policy shows some increase as choice
increases, but this may be caused by other factors. We conclude that based on
walk length, the Sticky Target policy generally produces at least 30 days less
drift than the Sliding Target policy.

coupled to a resonator such an ensemble may serve as a multi-mode quantum
memory for the resonator field, and by employing spin-refocusing techniques the
quantum memory time can be extended to the coherence time of individual spins
in the ensemble. In the present paper we investigate such a memory protocol
capable of storing an unknown resonator-field state, and we examine separately
the various constituents of the protocol: the storage and read-out part, the
memory hold time with the spin ensemble and resonator field decoupled, and the
parts employing spin refocusing techniques. Using both analytical and numerical
methods we derive how the obtainable memory performance scales with various
physical parameters.

Accurate molecular dynamics (MD) techniques based on first principles or
tight-binding models are employed in the analysis of single irradiation-induced

algorithm to simulate continuous irradiation of nanomaterials. It has been
shown that sulphur-terminated graphene nanoribbons are formed inside carbon

exchange for better performance and resilience. An important weak consistency
property is k-atomicity, which bounds the staleness of values returned by read
operations. The k-atomicity-verification problem (or k-AV for short) is the
problem of deciding whether a given history of operations is k-atomic. The 1-AV
problem is equivalent to verifying atomicity/linearizability, a well-known and
solved problem. However, for k > 2, no polynomial-time k-AV algorithm is known.
  This paper makes the following contributions towards solving the k-AV
problem. First, we present a simple 2- AV algorithm called LBT, which is likely
to be efficient (quasilinear) for histories that arise in practice, although it
is less efficient (quadratic) in the worst case. Second, we present a more
involved 2-AV algorithm called FZF, which runs efficiently (quasilinear) even
in the worst case. To our knowledge, these are the first algorithms that solve
the 2-AV problem fully. Third, we show that the weighted k-AV problem, a
natural extension of the k-AV problem, is NP-complete.

string segment is expected to cause weak lensing as well as an integrated
Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, the so-called Gott-Kaiser-Stebbins (GKS) effect, to
the CMB temperature fluctuation, which are thus naturally cross-correlated. We
point out that, in the presence of such a correlation, yet another kind of the
post-recombination CMB temperature bispectra, the ISW-lensing bispectra, will
arise in the form of products of the auto- and cross-power spectra. We first
present an analytic method to calculate the autocorrelation of the temperature
fluctuations induced by the strings, and the cross-correlation between the
temperature fluctuation and the lensing potential both due to the string
network. In our formulation, the evolution of the string network is assumed to
be characterized by the simple analytic model, the velocity-dependent one scale
model, and the intercommutation probability is properly incorporated in orderto
characterize the possible superstringy nature. Furthermore, the obtained power
spectra are dominated by the Poisson-distributed string segments, whose
correlations are assumed to satisfy the simple relations. We then estimate the
signal-to-noise ratios of the string-induced ISW-lensing bispectra and discuss
the detectability of such CMB signals from the cosmic string network. It is
found that in the case of the smaller string tension, $G\mu\ll 10^{-7}$\,, the
ISW-lensing bispectrum induced by a cosmic string network can constrain the
string-model parameters even more tightly than the purely GKS-induced
bispectrum in the ongoing and future CMB observations on small scales.

observations from the SDSS-III/Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution
Experiment (APOGEE) and the largest published sample of high resolution Sgr
dSph spectra to date, reveal a distinct gradient in the velocity dispersion of
Sgr from 11-14 km/s for radii >0.8 degrees from center to a dynamical cold
point of 8 km/s in the Sgr center --- a trend differing from that found in
previous kinematical analyses of Sgr over larger scales that suggest a more or
less flat dispersion profile at these radii. Well-fitting mass models with
either cored and cusped dark matter distributions can be found to match the
kinematical results, although the cored profile succeeds with significantly
more isotropic stellar orbits than required for a cusped profile. It is
unlikely that the cold point reflects an unusual mass distribution. The
dispersion gradient may arise from variations in the mixture of populations
with distinct kinematics within the dSph; this explanation is suggested (e.g.,
by detection of a metallicity gradient across similar radii), but not
confirmed, by the present data. Despite these remaining uncertainties about
their interpretation, these early test data (including some from instrument
commissioning) demonstrate APOGEE's usefulness for precision dynamical studies,

However, high power transmit signal will appear at receive chain as echoes with
powers much higher than the desired received signal. Therefore, in order to
achieve the potential gain, it is imperative to cancel these echoes. As these
high power echoes can saturate low noise amplifier (LNA) and also digital
domain echo cancellation requires unrealistically high resolution
analog-to-digital converter (ADC), the echoes should be cancelled or suppressed
sufficiently before LNA. In this paper we present a closed-loop echo
cancellation technique which can be implemented purely in analogue domain. The
advantages of our method are multiple-fold: it is robust to phase noise, does
not require additional set of antennas, can be applied to wideband signals and
the performance is irrelevant to radio frequency (RF) impairments in transmit
chain. Next, we study a few protocols for STR systems in carrier sense multiple

to an anti-crossing gap between two zero-mode Landau levels in a HgTe

is found that this is the main contribution to the anti-crossing splitting
observed in recent experimental magneto spectroscopic measurements. The
relevant optical transitions involve different subbands, but the

this critical radius increases as the angular momentum index increases. In the
limit of large disk radius, the energy of the edge state approaches a limiting
value determined by the system parameters and independent of the angular
momentum index. The derivation from this limiting value is inversely
proportional to the radius with a coefficient proportional to the angular
momentum index. In the general case, the energy differences between two edge
states with adjacent angular momentum indexes are not equal. The exact and
analytical wave functions also facilitates the investigation of electronic
state in other structures of the two dimensional topological insulator.

biharmonic equation by using weak Galerkin (WG) finite element methods. The WG
finite element scheme is based on a variational form of the biharmonic equation
that is equivalent to the usual $H^2$-semi norm. Weak partial derivatives and
their approximations, called discrete weak partial derivatives, are introduced
for a class of discontinuous functions defined on a finite element partition of
the domain consisting of general polygons or polyhedra. The discrete weak
partial derivatives serve as building blocks for the WG finite element method.
The resulting matrix from the WG method is symmetric, positive definite, and
parameter free. An error estimate of optimal order is derived in an
$H^2$-equivalent norm for the WG finite element solutions. Error estimates in
the usual $L^2$ norm are established, yielding optimal order of convergence for
all the WG finite element algorithms except the one corresponding to the lowest
order (i.e., piecewise quadratic elements). Some numerical experiments are
presented to illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of the numerical scheme.

The position resolution is 2 mm in the center of detector, limited by the hole

of 1.6%({\sigma} /E) for 662 keV gamma rays is achieved by combining the
ionization and scintillation signals at a drift field of 0.5 kV/cm. This
represents the best energy resolution achieved among liquid xenon detectors.
The energy resolution is only slightly dependent on drift field. Better than 2%
energy resolution ({\sigma} /E) for 662 keV gamma rays can be achieved for
drift fields between 100 V/cm and 2 kV/cm. With high position and energy
resolutions, a dual phase XeTPC has also potential applications in surveys for
neutrinoless double-beta decay and in gamma ray imaging.

the cell and its direct external environment. A classic model describes it as a
fluid mosaic. The fluid phase of the membrane allows a lateral degree of
freedom to its constituents: they seem to be driven by random motions along the
membrane. On the other hand, experimentations bring to light inhomogeneities on
the membrane; these micro-domains (the so-called rafts) are very rich in
proteins and phospholipids. Nevertheless, few functional properties of these
micro-domains have been shown and it appears necessary to build appropriate
models of the membrane for recreating the biological mechanism. In this
article, we propose a random walk model simulating the evolution of certain
constituents-the so-called ligands-along a heterogeneous membrane.
Inhomogeneities-the rafts-are described as being still clustered receptors. An
important variable of interest to biologists is the time that ligands and
receptors bind during a fixed amount of time. This stochastic time can be
interpreted as a measurement of affinity/sentivity of ligands for receptors. It
corresponds to the sojourn time in a suitable set for a certain random walk. We
provide a method of calculation for the probability distribution of this random
variable and we next determine explicitly this distribution in the simple case
when we are dealing with only one ligand and one receptor. We finally address
some further more realistic models.

way of explicitly breaking supersymmetry without reintroducing fine-tuning. We
illustrate our idea by considering a model of scalar gravity with

we discovered an exact mapping between the Kondo lattice Hamiltonian and a

investigate the effectiveness of this three fermion representation by
performing a zero temperature mean-field study of the phase diagram at
different couplings and fillings for the one-dimensional case, focusing on the
appearance of ferromagnetism. The solutions agree in many respects with the
known numerical and analytical results. In particular, in the ferromagnetic
region connected to the solution at zero electron density, we have a
quantitative agreement on the value of the commensurability parameter
discovered in recent DMRG (in one dimension) and DMFT (in infinite dimensions)
simulations; furthermore we provide a theoretical justification for it,
identifying a symmetry of the Hamiltonian. This ferromagnetic phase is
stabilized by the emergence of a spin-selective Kondo insulator that is
described quite conveniently by the three spinless fermions. We discovered also
a different ferromagnetic phase at high filling and low couplings. This phase
resembles the RKKY ferromagnetic phase existing at vanishing filling, but it
incorporates much more of the Kondo effect, making it energetically more
favorable than the typical spiral (spin ordered) mean field ground states. We
believe that this second phase represents a prototype for the strange
ferromagnetic tongue identified by numerical simulations inside the
paramagnetic dome. At the end of the work we also provide a discussion of
possible orders different from the ferromagnetic one. In particular at
half-filling, where we obtain as ground state at high coupling the correct

approach is to simply introduce a time-dependent collective atom-photon
coupling. We show that the maximal squeezing factor measured experimentally can
be well controlled by both its driving magnitude and driving frequency. In
particular, when increasing the driving magnitude, the maximal squeezing factor
increases and thus can be rapidly enhanced. We also demonstrate explicitly in
the high-frequency approximation that this spin squeezing arises from a strong
repulsive spin-spin interaction induced by the time-dependent collective
atom-photon coupling. Finally, we evaluate analytically, by using current
experimental parameters, the maximal squeezing factor, which can reach 40 dB.
This squeezing factor is far larger than previous ones.

processing than for traditional digital communications and computation. A
typical obstacle to constructing a variety of strong quantum error-correcting

Recently, promising solutions to this problem have been proposed in quantum

exciting the highest order MQ coherences in clusters of 4m identical spins,

AFI state is initially weakened (P$_{O}$ >= 30 Pa), but then becomes more
robust against the magnetic field (P$_{O}$ < 30 Pa). The out-of-plane film
lattice parameter increases with decreasing P$_{O}$. For films grown at
P$_{O}$>= 30 Pa, the slight oxygen deficiency may enlarge the lattice unit
cell, reduce the anisotropic strain and suppress the AFI state. Films deposited
at P$_{O}$ < 30 Pa instead experience an average compressive strain. The
enhanced compressive strain and structural defects in the films may lead to the
robust AFI state. These results aid our understanding of PS in manganite films.

prove that for any $f:\N_0\to\N_0$, there exists a sequence
$\{a_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ such that every positive integer has a unique
$f$-decomposition using $\{a_n\}$. Further, if $f$ is periodic, then the unique
increasing sequence $\{a_n\}$ that corresponds to $f$ satisfies a linear
recurrence relation. Previous research only handled recurrence relations with
no negative coefficients. We find a function $f$ that yields a sequence that
cannot be described by such a recurrence relation. Finally, for a class of

number of positive and negative terms in given Skipponacci decompositions
converges to a Gaussian, with a computable correlation coefficient that is a
rational function of the smallest root of the characteristic polynomial of the
recurrence. The proof uses recursion to obtain the generating function for
having a fixed number of summands, which we prove converges to the generating
function of a Gaussian. We next explore the distribution of gaps between
summands, and show that for any k the probability of finding a gap of length $j
\ge 2k+2$ decays geometrically, with decay ratio equal to the largest root of
the given k-Skipponacci recurrence. We conclude by finding sequences that have
an (s,d) far-difference representation for any positive integers s,d.

important area of Research. There is a possibility of an attacker creating

achieved by discovering random multiple paths using multiple domains, and
forwarding data packets from the source node to the destination node. We have
designed, Multiple Domain Routing with Overlap of Nodes (MDRON) and Multiple
Domain Routing Without Overlap of Nodes (MDRWON) algorithms, in which packets
follow multiple optimized paths simultaneously. The Special node algorithm
searches the node which has maximum power and these nodes are used for
transferring the packet from one domain to another domain. Simulation results
using MATLAB shows that performance is better than Purely Random Propagation

quantified convergence rates as well as introducing and developing techniques
to measure and control the dependencies. The construction of these tools is one
of the major motivations of this work, as our approach can be applied to many
other dependent systems. As an example, we show that the $n!$ entries in the

to oxidize through the center, leading to a decrease in the optical path

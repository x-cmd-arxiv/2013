cluster M3, an aberrant light-curve, non-Blazhko RRab star, V123, was detected.
Based on its brightness, colors and radial velocity curve, V123 is a bona fide
member of M3. The light curve of V123 exhibits neither a bump preceding light
minimum, nor a hump on the rising branch, and has a longer than normal rise
time, with a convex shape. Similar shape characterizes the mean light curves of
some large-modulation-amplitude Blazhko stars, but none of the regular RRab
variables with similar pulsation periods. This peculiar object thus mimics
Blazhko variables without showing any evidence of periodic amplitude and/or
phase modulation. We cannot find any fully convincing answer to the peculiar
behavior of V123, however, the phenomenon raises again the possibility that
rotation and aspect angle might play a role in the explanation of the Blazhko
phenomenon, and some source of inhomogeneity acts (magnetic field, chemical
inhomogeneity) that deforms the radial pulsation of Blazhko stars during the
modulation.

linear combination of columns of a matrix, has long been the mainstay of the
statistics and signal processing literature. One particular challenge for
inference under linear models is understanding the conditions on the dictionary
under which reliable inference is possible. This challenge has attracted
renewed attention in recent years since many modern inference problems deal
with the ""underdetermined"" setting, in which the number of observations is much
smaller than the number of columns in the dictionary. This paper makes several
contributions for this setting when the set of observations is given by a
linear combination of a small number of groups of columns of the dictionary,
termed the ""block-sparse"" case. First, it specifies conditions on the
dictionary under which most block subdictionaries are well conditioned. This
result is fundamentally different from prior work on block-sparse inference
because (i) it provides conditions that can be explicitly computed in
polynomial time, (ii) the given conditions translate into near-optimal scaling
of the number of columns of the block subdictionaries as a function of the
number of observations for a large class of dictionaries, and (iii) it suggests
that the spectral norm and the quadratic-mean block coherence of the dictionary
(rather than the worst-case coherences) fundamentally limit the scaling of
dimensions of the well-conditioned block subdictionaries. Second, this paper
investigates the problems of block-sparse recovery and block-sparse regression
in underdetermined settings. Near-optimal block-sparse recovery and regression
are possible for certain dictionaries as long as the dictionary satisfies
easily computable conditions and the coefficients describing the linear
combination of groups of columns can be modeled through a mild statistical
prior.

up to conjugation. Moreover, $\wedge (\g^*)^\g$ is freely generated (in the
super-graded sense) by primitive elements $\omega_1, \dots, \omega_\ell$, where
$\ell$ is the rank of $\g$. N. Hitchin conjectured that for any primitive

matter physics is known as Mottronics, whose goal is to incorporate strong
correlation effects into the realm of electronics. In fact, taming the Mott
insulator-to-metal transition (IMT), which is driven by strong electronic
correlation effects, holds the promise of a commutation speed set by a quantum
transition, and with negligible power dissipation. In this context, one
possible route to control the Mott transition is to electrostatically dope the
systems using strong dielectrics, in FET-like devices. Another possibility is
through resistive switching, that is, to induce the insulator-to-metal
transition by strong electric pulsing. This action brings the correlated system
far from equilibrium, rendering the exact treatment of the problem a difficult
challenge. Here, we show that existing theoretical predictions of the
off-equilibrium manybody problem err by orders of magnitudes, when compared to
experiments that we performed on three prototypical narrow gap Mott systems
V2-xCrxO3, NiS2-xSex and GaTa4Se8, and which also demonstrate a striking
universality of this Mott resistive transition (MRT). We then introduce and
numerically study a model based on key theoretically known physical features of
the Mott phenomenon in the Hubbard model. We find that our model predictions
are in very good agreement with the observed universal MRT and with a
non-trivial timedelay electric pulsing experiment, which we also report. Our
study demonstrates that the MRT can be associated to a dynamically directed
avalanche.

another in terms of a motor representation of that speech. However, when we
have learned to recognize a foreign accent, it seems plausible that recognition
of a word rarely involves reconstruction of the speech gestures of the speaker
rather than the listener. To better assess the motor theory and this
observation, we proceed in three stages. Part 1 places the motor theory of
speech perception in a larger framework based on our earlier models of the
adaptive formation of mirror neurons for grasping, and for viewing extensions
of that mirror system as part of a larger system for neuro-linguistic
processing, augmented by the present consideration of recognizing speech in a
novel accent. Part 2 then offers a novel computational model of how a listener
comes to understand the speech of someone speaking the listener's native
language with a foreign accent. The core tenet of the model is that the
listener uses hypotheses about the word the speaker is currently uttering to
update probabilities linking the sound produced by the speaker to phonemes in
the native language repertoire of the listener. This, on average, improves the
recognition of later words. This model is neutral regarding the nature of the
representations it uses (motor vs. auditory). It serve as a reference point for
the discussion in Part 3, which proposes a dual-stream neuro-linguistic
architecture to revisits claims for and against the motor theory of speech
perception and the relevance of mirror neurons, and extracts some implications
for the reframing of the motor theory.

including QED, QCD, and electroweak radiative effects. We carefully explore the

the relevant kinematic variables from the measured hadronic final state in
charged current events, assuming realistic detector performance parameters.
Finally, we estimate the impact of the simulated charged current single-spin

one combination of histone modification invariantly translates to one
transcriptional output regardless of local chromatin environment. In this study
we hypothesize that, the genome is organized into local domains that manifest
similar enrichment pattern of histone modification, which leads to orchestrated
regulation of expression of genes with relevant bio- logical functions. We
propose a multivariate Bayesian Change Point (BCP) model to segment the
Drosophila melanogaster genome into consecutive blocks on the basis of
combinatorial patterns of histone marks. By modeling the sparse distribution of
histone marks across the chromosome with a zero-inflated Gaussian mixture, our
partitions capture local BLOCKs that manifest relatively homogeneous enrichment
pattern of histone modifications. We further characterized BLOCKs by their
transcription levels, distribution of genes, degree of co-regulation and GO
enrichment. Our results demonstrate that these BLOCKs, although inferred merely
from histone modifications, reveal strong relevance with physical domains,
which suggest their important roles in chromatin organization and coordinated
gene regulation.

possible to give a physical meaning to their empirical coefficients, to
calculate well defined quantities and to compare the results obtained from
different isotherms. Another interesting consequence of this finding is that it
is possible to relate the shape of the isotherm to the distribution of sorption
energies which we have calculated for each isotherm. In particular, we show
that the energy distribution corresponding to the Brouers-Sotolongo (BS)

the postulates of quantum mechanics. This modification allows one, throughout a
sequence of observations of an excited system, to address the nature of the
observable and thereby to distinguish survival from non-decay, which is
necessary whenever excited states are degenerate. As a consequence, one can
determine which types of measurements can possibly inhibit the exponential
decay of the system. We find that continuous monitoring taken as the limit of a
sequence of ideal measurements will only inhibit decay in special cases, such
as in well-controlled experiments. Uncontrolled monitoring of an unstable
system, however, can cause exponentially decreasing non-decay probability at
all times. Furthermore, calculating the decay rate for a general sequence of
observations leads to a straightforward derivation of Fermi's Golden Rule, that
avoids many of the conceptual difficulties normally encountered. When multiple
decay channels are available, the derivation reveals how the total decay rate
naturally partitions into a sum of the decay rates for the various channels, in
agreement with observations. Continuous and unavoidable monitoring of an
excited system by an uncontrolled environment may therefore be a mechanism by
which to explain the exponential decay law.

applied to a specific case of the Veltmann models that is known to closely
approximate the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, and also to the Plummer and

with obtaining hypervirial distribution functions, i.e. distribution functions
that satisfy the local virial theorem, for several well-known models. In order
to construct the hypervirial augmented densities and the corresponding
distribution functions, we start with an appropriate ansatz for the former and
proceed to determine the coefficients appearing in that ansatz by expanding the
potential--density pair as a series, around $r=0$ and $r=\infty$. By doing so,
we obtain hypervirial distribution functions, valid in these two limits, that
can generate the potential--density pairs of these models to an arbitrarily
high degree of accuracy. This procedure is explicitly carried out for the
H\'enon isochrone, Jaffe, Dehnen and NFW models and the accuracy of this
procedure is established. Finally, we derive some universal properties for
these hypervirial distribution functions, involving the asymptotic behaviour of
the anisotropy parameter and its relation to the density slope in this regime.
In particular, we show that the cusp slope--central anisotropy inequality is
saturated.

First, the capped capillary may allow for vapour, drop-like, and slab-like

Second, the slit pore forming the bulk of the capped capillary may allow for
the coexistence between vapour, planar prewetting film and capillary-liquid.
While the consideration of the former case allows us to summarise the
phenomenology presented in Part I and to show that the transition line of wedge
prewetting is shifted in capillary-like geometries by a constant value,
depending on the capillary width, the careful examination of the latter case
allows us to uncover a new phase transition in confined fluids, a continuous
planar prewetting transition. A planar prewetting transition is known to be a
distinctly first-order phenomenon, and typically taking place on the scale of
several atomic diameters. A continuous prewetting transition, on the other
hand, is scale invariant. Thus, apart from being of fundamental significance,
this finding has potential for facilitating experimental detection as well as
measurements of planar prewetting. Further, we provide proof for the existence
of a tri-critical point of the three-phase coexistence line of the capped

cyclotron resonant scattering feature (CRSF) near 37 keV. This makes it an
ideal target for detailed study with the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array
(NuSTAR), taking advantage of its excellent hard X-ray spectral resolution. We
observed Her X-1 three times, coordinated with Suzaku, during one of the high
flux intervals of its 35d super-orbital period. This paper focuses on the shape
and evolution of the hard X-ray spectrum. The broad-band spectra can be fitted
with a powerlaw with a high-energy cutoff, an iron line, and a CRSF. We find
that the CRSF has a very smooth and symmetric shape, in all observations and at
all pulse-phases. We compare the residuals of a line with a Gaussian optical
depth profile to a Lorentzian optical depth profile and find no significant
differences, strongly constraining the very smooth shape of the line. Even
though the line energy changes dramatically with pulse phase, we find that its
smooth shape does not. Additionally, our data show that the continuum is only
changing marginally between the three observations. These changes can be
explained with varying amounts of Thomson scattering in the hot corona of the
accretion disk. The average, luminosity-corrected CRSF energy is lower than in
past observations and follows a secular decline. The excellent data quality of
NuSTAR provides the best constraint on the CRSF energy to date.

BAL strengthening vs. weakening, correlations between BAL variability and

within an order-of-magnitude of the wind-launching radius, although a
significant minority of BAL troughs may arise on larger scales. We estimate an
average lifetime for a BAL trough along our line-of-sight of a few thousand

BAL variability, rather than being qualitatively distinct phenomena. We derive
the parameters of a random-walk model for BAL EW variability, finding that this

coordinated trough variability of BAL quasars with multiple troughs suggests
that changes in ""shielding gas"" may play a significant role in driving general

that the neutralino abundance is enhanced by the production via decay and

and dark radiation are typically overproduced. For judicious parameter choices,
these can be suppressed and the combined neutralino/axion abundance brought

potential to provide important constraints on the nuclear parton distributions
and thus contributing to a better understanding of the initial state in heavy
ion collisions. In order to quantify these constraints, as well as to assess
the compatibility with available nuclear data from fixed target experiments and
from RHIC, the traditional strategy is to perform a global fit of nuclear PDFs.
This procedure is however time consuming and technically challenging, and
moreover can only be performed by the PDF fitters themselves. In the case of
proton PDFs, an alternative approach has been suggested that uses Bayesian
inference to propagate the effects of new data into the PDFs without the need
of refitting. In this work, we apply this reweighting procedure to study the
impact on nuclear PDFs of low-mass Drell-Yan and single-inclusive
hadroproduction pseudo-data from proton-lead collisions at the LHC as
representative examples. In the hadroproduction case, in addition we assess the
possibility of discriminating between the DGLAP and CGC production frameworks.
We find that the LHC proton-lead data could lead to a substantial reduction of
the uncertainties on nuclear PDFs, in particular for the small-x gluon PDF
where uncertainties could decrease by up to a factor two. The Monte Carlo
replicas of EPS09 used in the analysis are released as a public code for
general use. It can be directly used, in particular, by the experimental
collaborations to check, in a straightforward manner, the degree of
compatibility of the new data with the global nPDF analyses.

make several exact statements about the theory. The ECFL Green's function is
shown to have a momentum independent Dyson (Mori) self energy. For practical
calculations we introduce a partial projection parameter \lambda, and obtain
the complete set of ECFL integral equations to second order in \lambda. In a
related publication, these equations are compared in detail with the dynamical
mean field theory for the large U Hubbard model. Paralleling the well known
mapping for the Hubbard model, we find that the infinite dimensional t-J model
can be mapped to the infinite-U Anderson impurity model with a
self-consistently determined set of parameters. This mapping extends
individually to the auxiliary Green's function and the caparison factor of the
ECFL theory. Additionally, the optical conductivity is shown to be obtainable
from the Green's function with negligibly small vertex corrections. These

accelerated in recent years. Further leaps forward will be facilitated by
imminent projects, which will enable us to map the evolution of dark and
baryonic matter density fluctuations over cosmic history. The way that these
fluctuations vary over space and time is sensitive to the nature of dark matter
and dark energy. Dark energy and gravity both affect how rapidly structure
grows; the greater the acceleration, the more suppressed the growth of
structure, while the greater the gravity, the more enhanced the growth. While
distance measurements also constrain dark energy, the comparison of growth and
distance data tests whether General Relativity describes the laws of physics
accurately on large scales. Modified gravity models are able to reproduce the
distance measurements but at the cost of altering the growth of structure
(these signatures are described in more detail in the accompanying paper on
Novel Probes of Gravity and Dark Energy). Upcoming surveys will exploit these
differences to determine whether the acceleration of the Universe is due to
dark energy or to modified gravity. To realize this potential, both wide field
imaging and spectroscopic redshift surveys play crucial roles. Projects

employing the MUSIC set of hydrodynamical simulations, featuring a mass-limited
sample of 282 resimulated clusters with available merger trees up to high
redshift, and we trace the cluster formation back to $z$ = 1.5, 2.3 and 4. We
study the features and redshift evolution of the mass and the spatial
distribution for all the cluster progenitors and for the protoclusters, which
we define as the most massive progenitors of the clusters identified at $z$ =
0. A natural extension to redshifts larger than 1 is applied to the estimate of
the baryon content also in terms of gas and stars budgets: no remarkable
variations with redshift are discovered. Furthermore, motivated by the proven
potential of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich surveys to blindly search for faint distant
objects, we focus on the scaling relation between total object mass and
integrated Compton $y$-parameter, and we check for the possibility to extend
the mass-observable paradigm to the protocluster regime, far beyond the
redshift of 1, to account for the properties of the simulated objects. We find
that the slope of this scaling law is steeper than what expected for a
self-similarity assumption among these objects, and it increases with redshift
mainly for the synthetic clusters where radiative processes, such as radiative
cooling, heating processes of the gas due to UV background, star formation and
supernovae feedback, are included. We use three different criteria to account
for the dynamical state of the protoclusters, and find no significant
dependence of the scaling parameters from the level of relaxation. Based on
this, we exclude that the dynamical state is the cause of the observed
deviations from self-similarity.

cosmological information encoded in cross-correlation statistics) measurements
of dark energy. The potential of cross-correlation methods is only beginning to
be realized. By bringing in information from other wavelengths, the
capabilities of the existing probes of dark energy can be enhanced and
systematic effects can be mitigated further. We present a mixture of work in
progress and suggestions for future scientific efforts. Given the scope of
future dark energy experiments, the greatest gains may only be realized with
more coordination and cooperation between multiple project teams; we recommend
that this interchange should begin sooner, rather than later, to maximize
scientific gains.

dark energy or modifications to Einstein's General Relativity as possible
explanations. The last decade has seen advances in theories that go beyond
smooth dark energy -- modified gravity and interactions of dark energy. While
the theoretical terrain is being actively explored, the generic presence of
fifth forces and dark sector couplings suggests a set of distinct observational
signatures. This report focuses on observations that differ from the
conventional probes that map the expansion history or large-scale structure.
Examples of such novel probes are: detection of scalar fields via lab
experiments, tests of modified gravity using stars and galaxies in the nearby
universe, comparison of lensing and dynamical masses of galaxies and clusters,
and the measurements of fundamental constants at high redshift. The
observational expertise involved is very broad as it spans laboratory
experiments, high resolution astronomical imaging and spectroscopy and radio
observations. In the coming decade, searches for these effects have the
potential for discovering fundamental new physics. We discuss how the searches
can be carried out using experiments that are already under way or with modest
adaptations of existing telescopes or planned experiments. The accompanying
paper on the Growth of Cosmic Structure describes complementary tests of
gravity with observations of large-scale structure.

addressing difficult information gathering problems. Near-optimal approaches
exist for sensing systems without internal states. However, when it comes to
optimizing the trajectories of mobile sensors the solutions are often greedy
and rarely provide performance guarantees. Notably, under linear Gaussian
assumptions, the problem becomes deterministic and can be solved off-line.
Approaches based on submodularity have been applied by ignoring the sensor
dynamics and greedily selecting informative locations in the environment. This
paper presents a non-greedy algorithm with suboptimality guarantees, which does
not rely on submodularity and takes the sensor dynamics into account. Our
method performs provably better than the widely used greedy one. Coupled with
linearization and model predictive control, it can be used to generate adaptive
policies for mobile sensors with non-linear sensing models. Applications in gas
concentration mapping and target tracking are presented.

uses a differential thickness-shear bulk mode of a PZT block as the drive mode
of the gyroscope. In the paper, a second differential thickness-extensional
mode is identified for the sense mode and mode-matching is proposed for the
first time by proper design of the device geomtries. Through finite element
modal analysis, the frequencies of drive mode and sense mode are obtained when
the length of the PZT block varies from 4.8mm to 5.6mm and the width of the PZT
block varies from 3.0mm to 4.0mm. Using a fitting method, the empirical
formulae with an excellent fit are induced to predict the influence of the
length and the width of the PZT block on the drive and sense mode frequencies.
Based on these empirical formulae, the mode-matching equations are introduced.
The analysis results show that for a given thickness of the PZT block, the
effect of the width on the drive mode frequency is prominant. Conversly, the
effect of length on the sense mode frequency is dominant. The resonance
frequencies, kinetic energy ratios, scale factors of gyroscope are compared to
evaluate the mode quality. The results show that the kinetic energy in y-axis
direction of the drive mode and the kinetic energy in z-axis direction of the
sense mode increase with the thickness of the PZT block, and consequently the
scale factor of the gyroscope increases. For a constant thickness of the PZT
block the scale factor will decrease as the length increases. Through design
optimization we present a 20 times improvement in the scale factor of the
mode-matched gyroscope. Given the thickness of PZT block, the length and the
width will be determined by the mode-matching equations mentioned. Generally,
the analysis suggests that the resolution of the gyroscope improves by
increasing the thickness PZT block.

right constraints are considered. Specifically, there is a sequence of random
variables whose probability density function will change at an unknown time.
The goal is to detect this change in a way such that a linear combination of
the average detection delay and the false alarm probability is minimized. Two
types of sampling right constrains are discussed. The first one is a limited
sampling right constraint, in which the observer can take at most $N$
observations from this random sequence. Under this setup, we show that the cost
function can be written as a set of iterative functions, which can be solved by
Markov optimal stopping theory. The optimal stopping rule is shown to be a
threshold rule. An asymptotic upper bound of the average detection delay is
developed as the false alarm probability goes to zero. This upper bound
indicates that the performance of the limited sampling right problem is close
to that of the classic Bayesian quickest detection for several scenarios of
practical interest. The second constraint discussed in this paper is a
stochastic sampling right constraint, in which sampling rights are consumed by
taking observations and are replenished randomly. The observer cannot take
observations if there are no sampling rights left. We characterize the optimal
solution, which has a very complex structure. For practical applications, we
propose a low complexity algorithm, in which the sampling rule is to take
observations as long as the observer has sampling rights left and the detection
scheme is a threshold rule. We show that this low complexity scheme is first
order asymptotically optimal as the false alarm probability goes to zero.

relatively modest. Ever since COBE delivered its map of data we know the scalar
spectrum of primordial perturbations is approximately flat, with the power
being only slightly stronger at larger scales. Most inflationary models predict
an approximately scale-invariant spectrum, which therefore cannot be used as a
distinctive signature. To distinguish between different inflationary
microphysics we need to study higher point statistics of the primordial
perturbation, which can encode non-gaussian data. In the first part of this
thesis we study the bispectrum in all single-field models with a well-defined
quantum field theory during a quasi-de Sitter inflationary phase. Any
single-field models without ghost-like instabilities fall into this
description: from canonical, to Dirac-Born-Infeld inflation and galileon
inflation theories. We investigate the scale and shape- dependences of the
bispectrum to next-order in the slow-roll approximation. We illustrate our
results by applying them to different models and argue these corrections must
be taken into account to keep the theoretical error below the observational
precision set by the Planck satellite. We then explore the ability of using
bispectrum shapes to distinguish between inflationary models more efficiently.
We further extend the study of the bispectrum of single-field models beyond the
slow-roll approximation, demanding the spectral index to be close to, but not
exactly, unity. In the second part of this thesis we explore the process by
which the universe is repopulated with matter particles at the end of a
Dirac-Born-Infeld inflation phase. We place some mild bounds on the reheating
temperature of these models. We argue that the constraints arising from the
preheating analysis are complementary to those derived from the primordial
perturbation.

This paper proposes an active approach to object detection by controlling the
point of view of a mobile depth camera. When an initial static detection phase
identifies an object of interest, several hypotheses are made about its class
and orientation. The sensor then plans a sequence of views, which balances the
amount of energy used to move with the chance of identifying the correct
hypothesis. We formulate an active hypothesis testing problem, which includes
sensor mobility, and solve it using a point-based approximate POMDP algorithm.
The validity of our approach is verified through simulation and real-world
experiments with the PR2 robot. The results suggest that our approach
outperforms the widely-used greedy view point selection and provides a
significant improvement over static object detection.

lower bounds on asymptotic phase transitions in a proportional-dimensional

The set of dimension-six operators involving the Higgs field is chosen in such

all high-precision electroweak constraints. A systematic study of effects in
various Higgs boson production channels (\gamma \gamma, ZZ, WW, bb-bar, \tau

methods are used to establish consistency of the standard Higgs sector with the
available LHC data. A global fit in the two-parametric anomalous coupling space
indicating to possible deviations from the standard Higgs-fermion and
Higgs-gauge boson couplings is performed, using post-Moriond 2012 data and more

the current CMS and ATLAS experimental results both in the infinitely small

where the feedback occurs and the large scales of galaxies (>1 kpc) that are
shaped by this feedback. To bridge this divide, in this paper we aim to assess
observationally the role of stellar feedback at the intermediate scales of HII
regions. In particular, we employ multiwavelength data to examine several
stellar feedback mechanisms in a sample of 32 HII regions in the Large and
Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC, respectively). Using optical, infrared,
radio, and X-ray images, we measure the pressures exerted on the shells from
the direct stellar radiation, the dust-processed radiation, the warm ionized
gas, and the hot X-ray emitting gas. We find that the warm ionized gas
dominates over the other terms in all of the sources, although two have
comparable dust-processed radiation pressures to their warm gas pressures. The
hot gas pressures are comparatively weak, while the direct radiation pressures
are 1-2 orders of magnitude below the other terms. We discuss the implications
of these results, particularly highlighting evidence for hot gas leakage from
the HII shells and regarding the momentum deposition from the dust-processed
radiation to the warm gas. Furthermore, we emphasize that similar observational
work should be done on very young HII regions to test whether direct radiation
pressure and hot gas can drive the dynamics at early times.

sinusoidal waveforms to be well defined, there is no guarantee that waveforms
will remain sinusoidal during transients. In this paper, we use energy-based
models derived from first principles that are not subject to hard-to-justify

Thus it cannot be directly applied for semi-supervised classification problem.

10 nm MoS2 ANR FET is evaluated by the density functional tight binding theory
and the non-equilibrium Green`s function approach. We study the channel density
of states, transmission spectra and the ID VD characteristics of such devices
under the varying conditions, with focus on the negative differential

simulations to capture shocks and discontinuities in the magnetic field. Here
we present a new method for adapting the strength of the applied resistivity so
that shocks are captured but the dissipation of the magnetic field away from
shocks is minimised. Our scheme utilises the gradient of the magnetic field as
a shock indicator, setting {\alpha}_B = h|gradB|/|B|, such that resistivity is
switched on only where strong discontinuities are present. The advantage to
this approach is that the resistivity parameter does not depend on the absolute
field strength. The new switch is benchmarked on a series of shock tube tests
demonstrating its ability to capture shocks correctly. It is compared against a
previous switch proposed by Price & Monaghan (2005), showing that it leads to
lower dissipation of the field, and in particular, that it succeeds at
capturing shocks in the regime where the Alfv\'en speed is much less than the
sound speed (i.e., when the magnetic field is very weak). It is also simpler.
We also demonstrate that our recent constrained divergence cleaning algorithm
has no difficulty with shock tube tests, in contrast to other implementations.

adversary (modeling the environment of the system) which is purely antagonistic
and asks for strict guarantees. On the other hand, stochastic models like
Markov decision processes represent situations where the system is faced to a
purely randomized environment: the aim is then to optimize the expected payoff,
with no guarantee on individual outcomes. We introduce the beyond worst-case
synthesis problem, which is to construct strategies that guarantee some
quantitative requirement in the worst-case while providing an higher expected
value against a particular stochastic model of the environment given as input.
This problem is relevant to produce system controllers that provide nice
expected performance in the everyday situation while ensuring a strict (but
relaxed) performance threshold even in the event of very bad (while unlikely)
circumstances. We study the beyond worst-case synthesis problem for two
important quantitative settings: the mean-payoff and the shortest path. In both
cases, we show how to decide the existence of finite-memory strategies
satisfying the problem and how to synthesize one if one exists. We establish
algorithms and we study complexity bounds and memory requirements.

processing. Pioneering experiments selected defects with favourably located
nuclear spins having particularly strong hyperfine couplings. For progress
towards large-scale applications, larger and deterministically available
nuclear registers are highly desirable. Here we realize universal control over
multi-qubit spin registers by harnessing abundant weakly coupled nuclear spins.
We use the electron spin of a nitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond to selectively
initialize, control and read out carbon-13 spins in the surrounding spin bath
and construct high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates. We exploit these new
capabilities to implement a three-qubit quantum-error-correction protocol and
demonstrate the robustness of the encoded state against applied errors. These
results transform weakly coupled nuclear spins from a source of decoherence
into a reliable resource, paving the way towards extended quantum networks and
surface-code quantum computing based on multi-qubit nodes.

R\'enyi entanglement entropy in two-dimensional conformal field theory. This
amounts to do the operator product expansion of the twist operators. We focus
on the vacuum Verma module and consider the quasiprimary operators constructed
from the stress tensors. After obtaining the expansion coefficients of the
twist operators to level 6 in vacuum Verma module, we compute the leading
contributions to the R\'enyi entropy, to order 6 in the short interval
expansion. In the case of one short interval on cylinder, we reproduce the
first several leading contributions to the R\'enyi entropy. In the case of two
short disjoint intervals with a small cross ratio $x$, we obtain not only the
classical and 1-loop quantum contributions to the R\'enyi entropy to order
$x^6$, both of which are in perfect match with the ones found in gravity, but
also the leading $1/c$ contributions, which corresponds to 2-loop corrections

The four Stokes parameters that provide a complete representation of partially
polarized light can now be simultaneously imaged with megapixel array detectors
with high polarimetric precision (0.001% in the degree of polarization). This
has led to new insights about the nature and properties of the magnetic field,
and has helped pave the way for the use of the Hanle effect as a diagnostic
tool beside the Zeeman effect. The magnetic structuring continues on scales
orders of magnitudes smaller than the resolved ones, but various types of
spectro-polarimetric signatures can be identified, which let us determine the
field strengths and angular distributions of the field vectors in the spatially
unresolved domain. Here we review the observational properties of the magnetic

new constraint on such activity. The Magellanic Stream is a clumpy gaseous
structure passing over the South Galactic Pole (SGP) at a distance of at least
50-100 kpc. Patchy H-alpha emission discovered along the Magellanic Stream over
the SGP is a factor of 5 too bright to have been produced by the Galactic
stellar population. Time-dependent models of Stream clouds exposed to a flare
in ionising photon flux show that the ionised gas must recombine and cool for a
time interval 0.6 - 2.9 Myr for the emitted H-alpha surface brightness to drop
to the observed level. A nuclear starburst is ruled out. Sgr A* is a more
likely candidate because it is two orders of magnitude more efficient at
converting gas to UV radiation. The central black hole (4 x 10^6 Msun) can
supply the required ionising luminosity with a fraction of the Eddington
accretion rate (3-30%). In support of nuclear activity, the H-alpha emission
along the Stream has a polar angle dependence peaking close to the SGP.
Moreover, it is now generally accepted that the Stream over the SGP must be
further than the Magellanic Clouds. At the lower halo gas densities, shocks
become too ineffective and are unlikely to give rise to a polar angle
dependence in the H-alpha emission. Thus it is likely that the Stream emission
arose from a `Seyfert flare' that was active 1-3 Myr ago, consistent with the
cosmic ray lifetime in the Fermi bubbles. Sgr A* activity today is greatly
suppressed (70-80 dB) relative to the Seyfert outburst...

tidal forces of the discs excite transient $m=1$ and $m=2$ wave modes, i.e.,
lopsidedness, spiral arms, and bars. However, after the merging of the discs,
such instabilities fade completely, and the remnant is thicker and bigger than
the original discs. The maximum relative amplitude of these waves is at most
about 15 times greater compared to the control case. of these two wave modes.
Finally, the disc settles down quickly, after the merger, in less than one
outer disc rotation period.

amplitude of thermal fluctuations around a mean structure, rather than shifts
in the structure itself, give rise to allostery in ligand binding. In a
complementary approach to experiments on real proteins, here we take a
theoretical route to identify the necessary structural components of this

coarse-grained to more detailed models, we show that, a fundamental requirement
for a body supporting fluctuation-induced allostery is a strongly inhomogeneous
elastic modulus. This requirement is reflected in many real proteins, where a
good approximation of the elastic structure maps strongly coherent domains onto

ionization in the ionospheric D-region and hence affects sub-ionospherically
propagating VLF signal amplitude and phase. In first part of the work, using
the well known LWPC technique, we simulated the flare induced excess lower
ionospheric electron density by amplitude perturbation method. Unperturbed
D-region electron density is also obtained from simulation and compared with
IRI-model results. Using these simulation results and time delay as key
parameters, we calculate the effective electron recombination coefficient
($\alpha_{eff}$) at solar flare peak region. Our results match with the same
obtained by other established models. In the second part, we dealt with the
solar zenith angle effect on D-region during flares. We relate this VLF data
with the solar X-ray data. We find that the peak of the VLF amplitude occurs
later than the time of the X-ray peak for each flare. We investigate this
so-called time delay ($\bigtriangleup t$). For the C-class flares we find that
there is a direct correspondence between $\bigtriangleup t$ of a solar flare
and the average solar zenith angle $Z$ over the signal propagation path at
flare occurrence time. Now for deeper analysis, we compute the $\bigtriangleup
t$ for different local diurnal time slots $DT$. We find that while the time
delay is anti-correlated with the flare peak energy flux $\phi_{max}$
independent of these time slots, the goodness of fit, as measured by
$reduced$-$\chi^2$, actually worsens as the day progresses. The variation of
the $Z$ dependence of $reduced$-$\chi^2$ seems to follow the variation of
standard deviation of $Z$ along the $T_x$-$R_x$ propagation path. In other
words, for the flares having almost constant $Z$ over the path a tighter
anti-correlation between $\bigtriangleup t$ and $\phi_{max}$ was observed.

$\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV. The model consists of two decoupled mechanisms
namely, color screening during bottomonium production followed by gluon induced
dissociation along with collisional damping. The quasi-particle model (QPM) is
used as equation of state (EOS) for the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) medium. The
feed-down from higher $\Upsilon$ states, such as $\Upsilon(1P)$, $\Upsilon(2S)$
and $\Upsilon(2P)$, dilated formation times for bottomonium states and viscous
effect of QGP medium are other ingredients included in the current formulation.
We further assume that the QGP is expanding according to (1+1)-dimensional
Bjorken's boost invariant scaling law. The net suppression (in terms of $p_T$
integrated survival probability) for bottomonium states at mid rapidity is
obtained as a function of centrality and the result is then compared both
quantitatively and qualitatively with the recent LHC experimental data in the
mid rapidity region recently published by CMS collaboration. We find that the
current model, based on the Debye color screening plus gluonic dissociation
along with collisional damping, better describes the centrality dependence of
bottomonium suppression at LHC energy as compared to color screening model
alone.

  Computational Linguistics (CMCL), June 2011, Portland, OR",,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Since many real-world concepts are associated with colour, for example danger
with red, linguistic information is often complimented with the use of
appropriate colours in information visualization and product marketing. Yet,
there is no comprehensive resource that captures concept-colour associations.
We present a method to create a large word-colour association lexicon by
crowdsourcing. We focus especially on abstract concepts and emotions to show
that even though they cannot be physically visualized, they too tend to have
strong colour associations. Finally, we show how word-colour associations
manifest themselves in language, and quantify usefulness of co-occurrence and
polarity cues in automatically detecting colour associations.

  the Complex-valued Fast Block Sparse Bayesian Learning Algorithm",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Compressed Sensing based Terahertz imaging (CS-THz) is a computational
imaging technique. It uses only one THz receiver to accumulate the random
modulated image measurements where the original THz image is reconstruct from
these measurements using compressed sensing solvers. The advantage of the
CS-THz is its reduced acquisition time compared with the raster scan mode.
However, when it applied to large-scale two-dimensional (2D) imaging, the
increased dimension resulted in both high computational complexity and
excessive memory usage. In this paper, we introduced a novel CS-based THz
imaging system that progressively compressed the THz image column by column.
Therefore, the CS-THz system could be simplified with a much smaller sized
modulator and reduced dimension. In order to utilize the block structure and
the correlation of adjacent columns of the THz image, a complex-valued block
sparse Bayesian learning algorithm was proposed. We conducted systematic
evaluation of state-of-the-art CS algorithms under the scan based CS-THz
architecture. The compression ratios and the choices of the sensing matrices
were analyzed in detail using both synthetic and real-life THz images.
Simulation results showed that both the scan based architecture and the
proposed recovery algorithm were superior and efficient for large scale CS-THz
applications.

conical Radon transform. In $\mathbb{R}^3$ it maps a function to its surface
integrals over circular cones, and in $\mathbb{R}^2$ it maps a function to its
integrals along two rays with a common vertex. Such transforms appear in
various mathematical models arising in medical imaging, nuclear industry and
homeland security. This paper contains new results about inversion of conical
Radon transform with fixed opening angle and vertical central axis in
$\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$. New simple explicit inversion formulae are
presented in these cases. Numerical simulations were performed to demonstrate
the efficiency of the suggested algorithm in 2D.

lasers (XFELs). Self-seeding by a forward Bragg diffraction (FBD) monochromator
has been recently proposed [1] and demonstrated [2]. Characteristic time To of
FBD determines the power, spectral, and time characteristics of the FBD seed
[3]. Here we show that for a given electron bunch with duration sigma_e the
spectral flux of the self-seeding XFEL can be maximized, and the spectral
bandwidth can be respectively minimized by choosing To ~ sigma_e/pi and by
optimizing the electron bunch delay tau_e. The choices of To and tau_e are not
unique. In all cases, the maximum value of the spectral flux and the minimum
bandwidth are primarily determined by sigma_e. Two-color seeding takes place To
>> sigma_e/\pi. The studies are performed, for a Gaussian electron bunch
distribution with the parameters, close to those used in the short-bunch
(sigma_e ~ 5 fs) and long-bunch (sigma_e ~ 20 fs) operation modes of the LCLS
XFEL.

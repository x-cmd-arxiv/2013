plasma streaming along nonuniform stellar magnetic fields at the impact region
of accretion columns. We study how the magnetic field configuration and
strength determine the structure, geometry, and location of the shock-heated
plasma. METHODS. We model the impact of an accretion stream onto the
chromosphere of a CTTS by 2D axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Our
model takes into account the gravity, the radiative cooling, and the
magnetic-field-oriented thermal conduction. RESULTS. The structure, stability,
and location of the shocked plasma strongly depend on the configuration and
strength of the magnetic field. For weak magnetic fields, a large component of
B may develop perpendicular to the stream at the base of the accretion column,
limiting the sinking of the shocked plasma into the chromosphere. An envelope
of dense and cold chromospheric material may also develop around the shocked
column. For strong magnetic fields, the field configuration determines the
position of the shock and its stand-off height. If the field is strongly
tapered close to the chromosphere, an oblique shock may form well above the
stellar surface. In general, a nonuniform magnetic field makes the distribution
of emission measure vs. temperature of the shocked plasma lower than in the
case of uniform magnetic field. CONCLUSIONS. The initial strength and
configuration of the magnetic field in the impact region of the stream are
expected to influence the chromospheric absorption and, therefore, the
observability of the shock-heated plasma in the X-ray band. The field strength
and configuration influence also the energy balance of the shocked plasma, its
emission measure at T > 1 MK being lower than expected for a uniform field. The
above effects contribute in underestimating the mass accretion rates derived in
the X-ray band.

broken by current quark masses. In its simplest SU(2) incarnation, with two
non-strange quark flavors and three colors, this nonperturbative theory, which
can be selfconsistently bootstrapped in loop order, is shown to accurately
reproduce a host of low-energy observables with only one parameter, namely the
pion decay constant f_\pi. Extending the scheme to SU(3) by including the
strange quark, equally good results are obtained for many strong,
electromagnetic, and weak processes just with two extra constants, viz. f_K and
$\langle\pi|H_{\mbox{\scriptsize weak}}|K\rangle$. Links are made with the
vector-meson-dominance model, the BCS theory of superconductivity, and
chiral-symmetry restoration at high temperature. Finally, these ideas are
cautiously generalized to the electroweak sector, including the W, Z, and Higgs

CBCT dose from the OBI system in typical IGRT scan protocols. We first
conducted dose measurements in a water phantom. X-ray source model parameters

demonstrated by comparing calculations with measurements in water and in CTDI
phantoms. 25 brain cancer patients are used to study dose in a standard-dose
head protocol, and 25 prostate cancer patients are used to study dose in pelvis
protocol and pelvis spotlight protocol. Mean dose to each organ is calculated.
Mean dose to 2% voxels that have the highest dose is also computed to quantify
the maximum dose. It is found that the mean dose value to an organ varies
largely among patients. Moreover, dose distribution is highly non-homogeneous
inside an organ. The maximum dose is found to be 1~3 times higher than the mean
dose depending on the organ, and is up to 8 times higher for the entire body
due to the very high dose region in bony structures. High computational
efficiency has also been observed in our studies, such that MC dose calculation
time is less than 5 min for a typical case.

profiles commonly implemented in the execution industry. Execution then becomes
an absolutely continuous measure over such a measure space, and its
Radon-Nikodym derivative is commonly known as the Participation of Volume (PoV)
function. The four impact cost components are all consistently built upon the
PoV function. Some novel efforts are made for these linear impact models by
having market signals more properly expressed. For the opportunistic cost, we
are able to go beyond the conventional Brownian-type motions. By working
directly with the auto-covariances of the price dynamics, we remove the
Markovian restriction associated with Brownians and thus allow potential memory
effects in the price dynamics. In combination, the final execution model
becomes a constrained quadratic programming problem in infinite-dimensional
Hilbert spaces. Important linear constraints such as participation capping are
all permissible. Uniqueness and existence of optimal solutions are established
via the theory of positive compact operators in Hilbert spaces. Several typical
numerical examples explain both the behavior and versatility of the model.

the construction of smooth discrete velocity-pressure pairs for viscous
incompressible flows that are at the same time inf-sup stable and
divergence-free. When applied to discretize Stokes equations, it generates a
symmetric and indefinite linear system of saddle-point type. Krylov subspace
methods are usually the most efficient procedures to solve such systems. One of
such methods, for symmetric systems, is the Minimum Residual Method (MINRES).
However, the efficiency and robustness of Krylov subspace methods is closely
tied to appropriate preconditioning strategies. For the discrete Stokes system,
in particular, block-diagonal strategies provide efficient preconditioners. In
this paper, we compare the performance of block-diagonal preconditioners for
several block choices. We verify how eigenvalue clustering promoted by the
preconditioning strategies affects MINRES convergence. We also compare the
number of iterations and wall-clock timings. We conclude that an incomplete
Cholesky block-diagonal preconditioning strategy with relaxed inner conjugate
gradients iterations provides the best computational strategy when compared to
other block-diagonal and global solution strategies.

(WLANs), a large number of previous research efforts have been put to enhance
the transmission from the Access Point (AP) to stations (STAs). The downlink
Multi-User Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO) technique, supported by the
latest IEEE amendment-802.11ac, is considered as one of the key enhancements
leading WLANs to the Gigabit era. However, as cloud uploading services,
Peer-to-Peer (P2P) and telepresence applications get popular, the need for a
higher uplink capacity becomes inevitable.
  In this paper, a unified down/up-link Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol
called Uni-MUMAC is proposed to enhance the performance of IEEE 802.11ac WLANs
by exploring the multi-user spatial multiplexing technique. Specifically, in
the downlink, we implement an IEEE 802.11ac-compliant MU-MIMO transmission
scheme to allow the AP to simultaneously send frames to a group of STAs. In the
uplink, we extend the traditional one round channel access contention to two
rounds, which coordinate multiple STAs to transmit frames to the AP
simultaneously. 2-nd round Contention Window (CW2nd), a parameter that makes
the length of the 2-nd contention round elastic according to the traffic
condition, is introduced. Uni-MUMAC is evaluated through simulations in
saturated and non-saturated conditions when both downlink and uplink traffic
are present in the system. We also propose an analytic saturation model to
validate the simulation results. By properly setting CW2nd and other
parameters, Uni-MUMAC is compared to a prominent multi-user transmission scheme
in the literature. The results exhibit that Uni-MUMAC not only performs well in
the downlink-dominant scenario, but it is also able to balance both the
downlink and uplink throughput in the emerging uplink bandwidth-hungry
scenario.

genomic variation in a sample of homologous DNA sequences. It provides a highly
efficient dimensional reduction of large-scale population genomic data and its
mathematical dependence on the underlying population demography is well
understood, thus enabling the development of efficient inference algorithms.
However, it has been recently shown that very different population demographies
can actually generate the same SFS for arbitrarily large sample sizes. Although
in principle this nonidentifiability issue poses a thorny challenge to
statistical inference, the population size functions involved in the
counterexamples are arguably not so biologically realistic. Here, we revisit
this problem and examine the identifiability of demographic models under the
restriction that the population sizes are piecewise-defined where each piece
belongs to some family of biologically-motivated functions. Under this
assumption, we prove that the expected SFS of a sample uniquely determines the
underlying demographic model, provided that the sample is sufficiently large.
We obtain a general bound on the sample size sufficient for identifiability;
the bound depends on the number of pieces in the demographic model and also on
the type of population size function in each piece. In the cases of
piecewise-constant, piecewise-exponential and piecewise-generalized-exponential
models, which are often assumed in population genomic inferences, we provide
explicit formulas for the bounds as simple functions of the number of pieces.
Lastly, we obtain analogous results for the ""folded"" SFS, which is often used
when there is ambiguity as to which allelic type is ancestral. Our results are
proved using a generalization of Descartes' rule of signs for polynomials to
the Laplace transform of piecewise continuous functions.

is a highly efficient scheme for studying the dynamics of high-dimensional
quantum systems. Its use is greatly facilitated if the Hamiltonian of the
system possesses a particular structure through which the multi-dimensional
matrix elements can be computed efficiently. In the field of quantum molecular
dynamics, the effective interaction between the atoms is often described by
potential energy surfaces (PES), and it is necessary to fit such PES into the
desired structure. For high-dimensional systems, the current approaches for
this fitting process either lead to fits that are too large to be practical, or
their accuracy is difficult to predict and control.
  This article introduces multi-layer Potfit (MLPF), a novel fitting scheme
that results in a PES representation in the hierarchical tensor (HT) format.
The scheme is based on the hierarchical singular value decomposition, which can
yield a near-optimal fit and give strict bounds for the obtained accuracy.
Here, a recursive scheme for using the HT-format PES within ML-MCTDH is
derived, and theoretical estimates as well as a computational example show that
the use of MLPF can reduce the numerical effort for ML-MCTDH by orders of
magnitude, compared to the traditionally used Potfit representation of the PES.
Moreover, it is shown that MLPF is especially beneficial for high-accuracy PES
representations, and it turns out that MLPF leads to computational savings
already for comparatively small systems with just four modes.

Continuity of this family holds within any choice of representation and, in

  The semiclassical appproximation relies on individual classical trajectories
together with their neighbouring tangent map. Based on the latter, one defines
a continuous family of unitary tangent propagators, with an exact Weyl
representation that is close to the full semiclassical approximation in an
appropriate neighbourhood. The phase increment of the semiclassical Weyl
propagator, as a caustic is crossed, is derived from the facts that the
corresponding family of tangent operators belong to the metaplectic group and
that the products of the tangent propagators are obtained from Gaussian

the Hopf bifurcation associated with the emergence of bursting to change from
sub-critical to super-critical. This is confirmed with numerical simulations of
the full network for biologically reasonable parameter values. This change
decreases the plausibility of adaptation being the cause of bursting in

profile of nearby clusters obtained by the Chandra X-ray telescope. Using the
MOG virial theorem for clusters, we compare the mass profiles of clusters from
observation and theory for eleven clusters. The theoretical mass profiles for
the inner parts of clusters exceed the observational data. However, the
observational data for the inner parts of clusters (i.e., $r<0.1 r_{500}$) is
scattered, but at distances larger than $\sim 300$ kpc, the observed and
predicted mass profiles converge. Our results indicate that MOG as a theory of
modified gravity is compatible with the observational data from the the solar
system to Mega parsec scales without invoking dark matter.

densities. We focus our comparison on three key observational statistics:
number functions, ellipticity distributions, and radial density profiles. We
use the hierarchical tree structure of voids to interpret the impacts of
sampling density and galaxy bias, and theoretical and empirical functions to
describe the statistics in all our sample populations. We are able to make
simple adjustments to theoretical expectations to offer prescriptions for
translating from analytics to the void properties measured in realistic
observations. We find that sampling density has a much larger effect on void
sizes than galaxy bias. At lower tracer density, small voids disappear and the
remaining voids are larger, more spherical, and have slightly steeper profiles.

largely mimic those found in galaxy populations, except for ellipticities,
where galaxy bias leads to higher values. We use the void density profile of
Hamaus et al. (2014) to show that voids follow a self-similar and universal

the adamantane--adamantane interaction due to monolayer packing and it reduces
the IR intensity of the 2912 cm$^{-1}$ peak (gas phase) by a factor of 3.5. The
second modification originates from the adamantane--gold interaction and it
increases the IR intensity of the 2938 cm$^{-1}$ peak (gas phase) by a factor

centroids of both components are tightly constrained (~4"") and close to the

plane of the sky, extrapolation of the two NFW halos to a radius r200a=2.4 Mpc
yields a combined mass of M200a=(3.13+-0.56) x 10^15 Msun. This extrapolated
total mass is consistent with our two-component-based dynamical analysis and
previous X-ray measurements, projecting ACT-CL J0102-4915 to be the most
massive cluster at z>0.6 known to date.

that is surrounded by a tenuous disk, probably in transition between a massive
primordial disk and a debris disk. We observed the fine-structure lines of OI
at 63 and 145 micron and the CII line at 157 micron with the PACS instrument
onboard the Herschel Space Telescope as part of the open-time large programme
GASPS. We complemented the atomic line observations with archival Spitzer
spectroscopic and photometric continuum data, a ground-based VLT-VISIR image at
8.6 micron, and 12CO fundamental ro-vibrational and pure rotational J=3-2
observations. We simultaneously modeled the continuum emission and the line
fluxes with the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code MCFOST and the
thermo-chemical code ProDiMo to derive the disk gas- and dust properties
assuming no dust settling. The models suggest that the oxygen lines are emitted
from the inner disk around HD141569A, whereas the [CII] line emission is more
extended. The CO submillimeter flux is emitted mostly by the outer disk.
Simultaneous modeling of the photometric and line data using a realistic disk
structure suggests a dust mass derived from grains with a radius smaller than 1
mm of 2.1E-7 MSun and from grains with a radius of up to 1 cm of 4.9E-6 MSun.
We constrained the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) mass to be between
2E-11 and 1..4E-10 MSun assuming circumcircumcoronene (C150H30) as the
representative PAH. The associated PAH abundance relative to hydrogen is lower
than those found in the interstellar medium (3E-7) by two to three orders of
magnitude. The disk around HD141569A is less massive in gas (2.5 to 4.9E-4 MSun
or 67 to 164 MEarth) and has a flat opening angle (<10%). [abridged]

formation in regions of galaxies where the neutral interstellar medium is
predominantly composed of non-star-forming HI. In such regions, found today
predominantly in low-metallicity dwarf galaxies and in the outer parts of large
spirals, the star formation rate per unit area and per unit mass is much
smaller than in more molecule-rich regions. While in molecule-rich regions the
ultraviolet radiation field produced by efficient star formation forces the
density of the cold neutral medium to a value set by two-phase equilibrium, I
show that the low rates of star formation found in molecule-poor regions
preclude this condition. Instead, the density of the cold neutral gas is set by
the requirements of hydrostatic balance. Using this result, I extend the
Krumholz, McKee, & Tumlinson model for star formation and the atomic to
molecular transition to the molecule-poor regime. This ""KMT+"" model matches a
wide range of observations of the star formation rate and the balance between
the atomic and molecular phases in dwarfs and in the outer parts of spirals,
and is well-suited to implementation as a subgrid recipe for star formation in
cosmological simulations and semi-analytic models. I discuss the implications
of this model for star formation over cosmological times.

from the tetragonal metallic phase to the monoclinic insulating phase are
highly dependent on the optical pump fluence. At pump fluences higher than the
saturation fluence of 14.7 mJ/cm2, we observed a transient structural state
with lattice parameter larger than that of the tetragonal phase, which is
decoupled from the metal-to-insulator phase transition. Subsequently, the
photoexcited VO2 film recovered to the ground state at characteristic times
dependent upon the pump fluence, as a result of heat transport from the film to
the substrate. We present a procedure to measure the time-resolved film
temperature by correlating photoexcited and temperature-dependent x-ray
diffraction measurements. A thermal transport model that incorporates changes
of the thermal parameters across the phase transition reproduces the observed

thin films. However, recent experiments have shown that the BKT transition,
driven by phase fluctuations, is not sufficient to describe the loss of
superconducting order, and amplitude fluctuations have also to be taken into
account. The standard models that are extensively used to model two-dimensional
superconductors are the Hubbard and XY models. Whereas the XY model allows only
phase fluctuations, the Hubbard model has an extra degree of freedom: amplitude
fluctuations. In this paper we compare two Hubbard models with the same
critical temperature but with different interaction, and deduce the role of the
amplitude fluctuations in the superconducting transition. For this purpose, a
novel approximation is presented and used. We derive an effective phase-only
(XY) Hamiltonian, incorporating amplitude fluctuations in an explicit
temperature dependence of the phase rigidity. We study the relation between
amplitude fluctuations and coupling strength. Our results support existing
claims about the suppression of phase rigidity due to amplitude fluctuations

on a critical assumption that the network is First Order Markov (FOM) with

intuitive examples, mathematical generalizations, and computational experiments
that current RDS variance estimators will always underestimate the population
sampling variance of RDS in empirical networks that do not conform to the FOM
assumption. Analysis of 215 observed university and school networks from
Facebook and Add Health indicates that the FOM assumption is violated in every
empirical network we analyze, and that these violations lead to substantially
biased RDS estimators of sampling variance. We propose and test two alternative

societies, but the histories of cattle breeds have been poorly understood
especially for African, Asian, and American breeds. Using genotypes from 43,043
autosomal single nucleotide polymorphism markers scored in 1,543 animals, we
evaluate the population structure of 134 domesticated bovid breeds. Regardless
of the analytical method or sample subset, the three major groups of Asian
indicine, Eurasian taurine, and African taurine were consistently observed.
Patterns of geographic dispersal resulting from co-migration with humans and
exportation are recognizable in phylogenetic networks. All analytical methods
reveal patterns of hybridization which occurred after divergence. Using 19
breeds, we map the cline of indicine introgression into Africa. We infer that
African taurine possess a large portion of wild African auroch ancestry,
causing their divergence from Eurasian taurine. We detect exportation patterns
in Asia and identify a cline of Eurasian taurine/indicine hybridization in
Asia. We also identify the influence of species other than Bos taurus in the
formation of Asian breeds. We detect the pronounced influence of Shorthorn
cattle in the formation of European breeds. Iberian and Italian cattle possess
introgression from African taurine. American Criollo cattle are shown to be of
Iberian, and not African, decent. Indicine introgression into American cattle
occurred in the Americas, and not Europe. We argue that cattle migration,
movement and trading followed by admixture have been important forces in
shaping modern bovine genomic variation.

Riccati type first order differential equation, and using a general
integrability condition for the Riccati equation. This allows us to obtain an
exact non-singular solution of the interior field equations for a fluid sphere,
expressed in the form of infinite power series. The physical features of the
solution are studied in detail numerically by cutting the infinite series

$n=21$ terms in the power series representations of the relevant astrophysical
parameters. In the present model all physical quantities (density, pressure,
speed of sound etc.) are finite at the center of the sphere. The physical
behavior of the solution essentially depends on the equation of state of the
dense matter at the center of the star. The stability properties of the model
are also analyzed in detail for a number of central equations of state, and it
is shown that it is stable with respect to the radial adiabatic perturbations.

programming language parlance these are respectively partial evaluation,
self-interpretation, and reflection. In retrospect it is fascinating that
Kleene's 1938 proof is constructive; and in essence builds a self-reproducing

  Computability theory originated in the 1930s, long before the invention of
computers and programs. Its emphasis was on delimiting the boundaries of
computability. Some milestones include 1936 (Turing), 1938 (Kleene), 1967
(isomorphism of programming languages), 1985 (partial evaluation), 1989 (theory

efficient computer implementation of all three computability cornerstones,

large clusters. Such arrangement may facilitate signal amplification and the
integration of multiple stimuli. However, this organization likely also affects
the kinetics of signaling since the cytoplasmic enzymes that modulate the
activity of the receptors must localize to the cluster prior to receptor
modification. Here we examine how these spatial considerations shape signaling
dynamics at rest and in response to stimuli. As a model, we use the chemotaxis
pathway of Escherichia coli, a canonical system for the study of how organisms
sense, respond, and adapt to environmental stimuli. In bacterial chemotaxis,
adaptation is mediated by two enzymes that localize to the clustered receptors
and modulate their activity through methylation-demethylation. Using a novel
stochastic simulation, we show that distributive receptor methylation is
necessary for successful adaptation to stimulus and also leads to large
fluctuations in receptor activity in the steady state. These fluctuations arise
from noise in the number of localized enzymes combined with saturated
modification kinetics between localized enzymes and receptor substrate. An
analytical model explains how saturated enzyme kinetics and large fluctuations
can coexist with an adapted state robust to variation in the expression level
of the pathway constituents, a key requirement to ensure the functionality of
individual cells within a population. This contrasts with the well-mixed
covalent modification system studied by Goldbeter and Koshland in which mean
activity becomes ultrasensitive to protein abundances when the enzymes operate
at saturation. Large fluctuations in receptor activity have been quantified
experimentally. Here we clarify their mechanistic relationship with
well-studied aspects of the chemotaxis system, precise adaptation and
functional robustness.

precise enough to establish semantic properties, such as the absence of
run-time errors. Broadly speaking, there are two major branches of static
analysis for imperative programs. Pointer and shape analyses focus on inferring
properties of pointers, dynamically-allocated memory, and recursive data
structures, while numeric analyses seek to derive invariants on numeric values.
Although simultaneous inference of shape-numeric invariants is often needed,
this case is especially challenging and is not particularly well explored.
Notably, simultaneous shape-numeric inference raises complex issues in the
design of the static analyzer itself.
  In this paper, we study the construction of such shape-numeric, static
analyzers. We set up an abstract interpretation framework that allows us to
reason about simultaneous shape-numeric properties by combining shape and
numeric abstractions into a modular, expressive abstract domain. Such a modular
structure is highly desirable to make its formalization and implementation
easier to do and get correct. To achieve this, we choose a concrete semantics
that can be abstracted step-by-step, while preserving a high level of
expressiveness. The structure of abstract operations (i.e., transfer, join, and
comparison) follows the structure of this semantics. The advantage of this
construction is to divide the analyzer in modules and functors that implement

imperative programs that manipulate integers and arrays by using techniques
based on the transformation of constraint logic programs (CLP). We use CLP as a
metalanguage for representing imperative programs, their executions, and their
properties. First, we encode the correctness of an imperative program, say
prog, as the negation of a predicate 'incorrect' defined by a CLP program T. By
construction, 'incorrect' holds in the least model of T if and only if the
execution of prog from an initial configuration eventually halts in an error
configuration. Then, we apply to program T a sequence of transformations that
preserve its least model semantics. These transformations are based on
well-known transformation rules, such as unfolding and folding, guided by
suitable transformation strategies, such as specialization and generalization.
The objective of the transformations is to derive a new CLP program TransfT
where the predicate 'incorrect' is defined either by (i) the fact 'incorrect.'
(and in this case prog is not correct), or by (ii) the empty set of clauses
(and in this case prog is correct). In the case where we derive a CLP program
such that neither (i) nor (ii) holds, we iterate the transformation. Since the
problem is undecidable, this process may not terminate. We show through
examples that our method can be applied in a rather systematic way, and is
amenable to automation by transferring to the field of program verification
many techniques developed in the field of program transformation.

analysis techniques for ever more complex models. One approach proposed by
Esparza and Knoop is based on computation of predecessor or successor sets for
sets of automata configurations. Our goal is to adapt and exploit this approach

model of Monitor-DPNs for concurrent programs. Monitor-DPNs precisely model
unbounded recursion, dynamic thread creation, and synchronization via
well-nested locks with finite abstractions of procedure- and thread-local
state. Previous work on this model showed how to compute regular predecessor
sets of regular configurations and tree-regular successor sets of a fixed
initial configuration. By combining and extending different previously
developed techniques we show how to compute tree-regular successor sets of
tree-regular sets. Thereby we obtain an iterable, lock-sensitive forward
reachability analysis. We implemented the analysis for Java programs and
applied it to information flow control and data race detection.

primarily because of state explosion: the exponential growth of a program state

apply a divide and conquer strategy to ameliorate state explosion, by analyzing
only a single component at a time. We show that this strategy leads to the
notion of a ""split"" invariant, an assertion which is globally inductive, while
being structured as the conjunction of a number of local, per-component
invariants. This formulation is closely connected to the classical Owicki-Gries
method and to Rely-Guarantee reasoning. We show how the division of an
invariant into a number of pieces with limited scope makes it possible to apply
new, localized forms of symmetry and abstraction to drastically simplify its
computation. Split invariance also has interesting connections to parametric
verification. A quantified invariant for a parametric system is a split
invariant for every instance. We show how it is possible, in some cases, to
invert this connection, and to automatically generalize from a split invariant
for a small instance of a system to a quantified invariant which holds for the
entire family of instances.

naturally think backwards along the execution path of a program, and thinking
backwards makes it easy to locate the origin of a bug. So far backtracking has
been implemented mostly by state saving or by checkpointing. These
implementations, however, inherently do not scale. Meanwhile, a more recent
backtracking method based on reverse-code generation seems promising because
executing reverse code can restore the previous states of a program without
state saving. In the literature, there can be found two methods that generate
reverse code: (a) static reverse-code generation that pre-generates reverse
code through static analysis before starting a debugging session, and (b)
dynamic reverse-code generation that generates reverse code by applying dynamic
analysis on the fly during a debugging session. In particular, we espoused the
latter one in our previous work to accommodate non-determinism of a program
caused by e.g., multi-threading. To demonstrate the usefulness of our dynamic
reverse-code generation, this article presents a case study of various
backtracking methods including ours. We compare the memory usage of various
backtracking methods in a simple but nontrivial example, a bounded-buffer

Universe to probe the equations of state (EOS) of neutron-rich matter. With the
advent of next generation GW detectors, measuring the gravitational radiation
from coalescing binary neutron star systems, mountains on rotating neutron
stars, and stellar oscillation modes may become possible in the near future.
Using a set of model EOSs satisfying the latest constraints from terrestrial
nuclear experiments, state of the art nuclear many-body calculations of the
pure neutron matter EOS, and astrophysical observations consistently, we study
various GW signatures of the high-density behavior of the nuclear symmetry
energy, which is considered among the most uncertain properties of dense
neutron-rich nucleonic matter. In particular, we find the tidal polarizability
of neutron stars, potentially measurable in binary systems just prior to
merger, is more sensitive to the high density component of the nuclear symmetry
energy than the symmetry energy at nuclear saturation density. We also find
that the upper limit on the GW strain amplitude from elliptically deformed
stars is very sensitive to the density dependence of the symmetry energy. This
suggests that future developments in modeling of the neutron star crust, and
direct gravitational wave signals from accreting binaries will provide a wealth
of information on the EOS of neutron-rich matter. We also review the
sensitivity of the $r$-mode instability window to the density dependence of the
symmetry energy. Whereas models with larger values of the density slope of the
symmetry energy at saturation seem to be disfavored by the current
observational data, within a simple $r$-mode model, we point out that a
subsequent softer behavior of the symmetry energy at high densities (hinted at
by recent observational interpretations) could rule them in.

invariably leads to profiles that match those observed in the central regions
of galaxies. The density profile of the central region is universal and
insensitive to either the seed perturbation shape or the details of the
relaxation process. The profile has a central core; the multiplication of the
central density by the core radius is almost independent of the halo mass, in
accordance with observations. In the core area the density distribution behaves
as an Einasto profile with low index ($n\sim 0.5$); it has an extensive region
with $\rho\propto r^{-2}$ at larger distances. This is exactly the shape that
observations suggest for the central region of galaxies. On the other hand,
this shape does not fit the galaxy cluster profiles. A possible explanation of
this fact is that the relaxation is violent in the case of galaxy clusters;
however, it is not violent enough when galaxies or smaller dark matter
structures are considered. We discuss the reasons for this.

projected temperature trends from a collection of climate models running the

find that current trends lie near the lower limits of the model distributions,

with typical linear sizes of 10 nm to 100 nm that contain $10^3$ to $10^5$
spins and can be deformed in response to external perturbations. Weak
deformations are characterized by the internal modes which are localized around
the skyrmion center. Knowledge of internal modes is crucial to assess the
stability and rigidity of these topological textures. Here we compute the
internal modes of a skyrmion in the ferromagnetic background state by numerical
diagonalization of the dynamical matrix. We find several internal modes below
the magnon continuum, such as the mode corresponding to the translational
motion, and different kinds of breathing modes. The number of internal modes is
larger for lower magnetic fields. Indeed, several modes become gapless in the
low field region indicating that the single skyrmion solution becomes unstable,
although a skyrmion lattice is thermodynamically stable. On the other hand, at
high fields only three internal modes exist and the skyrmion is stable even at
higher fields when the ferromagnetic state is thermodynamically stable. We also
show that the presence of out-of-plane easy-axis anisotropy stabilizes the
single skyrmion solution. Finally, we discuss the effects of damping and
possible experimental observations of these internal modes.

process. But the initial conformation of neck linker (specially the three amino
acids of the extra turn) and the neck linker docking initiation mechanism
remain unclear. By using molecular dynamics method, we investigate the initial
conformation of kinesin's neck linker in the docking process. We find that, in
the initial state of NL docking process, NL still has interactions with
{\beta}0 and forms a conformation similar to the ""cover-neck bundle"" structure
proposed by Hwang et al. [Structure 2008, 16(1): 62-71]. From this initial
structure, the docking of the ""cover-neck bundle"" structure can be achieved.
The motor head provides a forward force on the initial cover-neck bundle

hydrophobic interaction of ILE327 with the hydrophobic pocket on the motor
head, drives the formation of the extra turn and initiates the neck linker
docking process.

entirely different meaning: ""The person rode the horse} vs. \emph{The horse
rode the person"". Given a video-sentence pair and a natural-language parser,
along with a grammar that describes the space of sentential queries, we produce
a score which indicates how well the video depicts the sentence. We produce
such a score for each video clip in a corpus and return a ranked list of clips.
Furthermore, this approach addresses two fundamental problems simultaneously:
detecting and tracking objects, and recognizing whether those tracks depict the
query. Because both tracking and object detection are unreliable, this uses
knowledge about the intended sentential query to focus the tracker on the
relevant participants and ensures that the resulting tracks are described by
the sentential query. While earlier work was limited to single-word queries

show that $d_T$ has monotonicity properties which make it compatible with the

results concerning the topology of $d_T$, including a brief study of the
$d_T$-convergence of monotone sequences. It is shown most of the results are
true without any assumption of an Archimedean-type property for $K$. One
considers various completeness properties and one studies the relations between
them. Since $d_T$ is defined in the context of a generic ordered linear space,
with no need of an underlying topological structure, one expects to express its
completeness in terms of properties of the ordering, with respect to the linear
structure. This is done in this paper and, to the best of our knowledge, this
has not been done yet. The Thompson metric $d_T$ and order-unit (semi)norms
$|\cdot|_u$ are strongly related and share important properties, as both are
defined in terms of the ordered linear structure. Although $d_T$ and
$|\cdot|_u$ are only topological (and not metrical) equivalent on $K_u$, we
prove that the completeness is a common feature. One proves the completeness of
the Thompson metric on a sequentially complete normal cone in a locally convex
space. At the end of the paper, it is shown that, in the case of a Banach
space, the normality of the cone is also necessary for the completeness of the
Thompson metric.

observational constraints on the phosphorous chemistry in the CSEs of O-rich

30m telescope and the Submillimeter Array (SMA), we observed four rotational
transitions of PN (J=2-1,3-2,6-5,7-6) and four of PO
(J=5/2-3/2,7/2-5/2,13/2-11/2,15/2-13/2). The IRAM 30m observations were
dedicated line observations, while the SMA data come from an unbiased spectral
survey in the frequency range 279-355 GHz.
  We present the first detections of PN and PO in an O-rich AGB star and
estimate abundances X(PN/H2) of about 3x10^-7 and X(PO/H2) in the range
0.5-6.0x10^-7. This is several orders of magnitude higher than what is found
for the C-rich AGB star IRC +10216. The diameter (<=0.7"") of the PN and PO
emission distributions measured in the interferometric data corresponds to a
maximum radial extent of about 40 stellar radii. The abundances and the spatial
occurrence of the molecules are in very good agreement with the results
reported for VY CMa. We did not detect PS or PH3 in the survey. We suggest that
PN and PO are the main carriers of phosphorus in the gas phase, with abundances
possibly up to several 10^-7. The current chemical models cannot account for
this, underlining the strong need for updated chemical models that include
phosphorous compounds.

mathematics, has already proven to be very interesting from the algorithmic
point of view: it is known to be in $NP\cap coNP$ but no polynomial time
algorithm is known, although counterexamples for existing pseudopolynomial
algorithms are (and have to be) very complex.
  In this work, we continue the study of algorithms for solving tropical linear
systems. First, we present a new reformulation of Grigoriev's algorithm that
brings it closer to the algorithm of Akian, Gaubert, and Guterman; this lets us
formulate a whole family of new algorithms, and we present algorithms from this
family for which no known superpolynomial counterexamples work. Second, we
present a family of algorithms for solving overdetermined tropical systems. We
show that for weakly overdetermined systems, there are polynomial algorithms in
this family. We also present a concrete algorithm from this family that can
solve a tropical linear system defined by an $m\times n$ matrix with maximal
element $M$ in time $\Theta\left({m \choose n} \mathrm{poly}\left(m, n, \log
M\right)\right)$, and this time matches the complexity of the best of
previously known algorithms for feasibility testing.

physical coherent state belonging to the metaplectic group Mp (n) with a
Poissonian distribution at lower n (number basis) restoring the classical
thermal continuum behaviour at large n (n ! 1), or leading to non-classical
radiation states, as is conjectured in a quite general basis by mean the

underlying the ability to survive of metabolic networks. We perform an
exhaustive computational screening of synthetic lethal reaction pairs in
Escherichia coli in a minimal medium and we find that synthetic lethal pairs
divide in two different groups depending on whether the synthetic lethal
interaction works as a backup or as a parallel use mechanism, the first
corresponding to essential plasticity and the second to essential redundancy.
In E. coli, the analysis of pathways entanglement through essential redundancy
supports the view that synthetic lethality affects preferentially a single
function or pathway. In contrast, essential plasticity, the dominant class,
tends to be inter-pathway but strongly localized and unveils Cell Envelope
Biosynthesis as an essential backup for Membrane Lipid Metabolism. When
comparing E. coli and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, we find that the metabolic
networks of the two organisms exhibit a large difference in the relative
importance of plasticity and redundancy which is consistent with the conjecture
that plasticity is a sophisticated mechanism that requires a complex
organization. Finally, coessential reaction pairs are explored in different
environmental conditions to uncover the interplay between the two mechanisms.
We find that synthetic lethal interactions and their classification in
plasticity and redundancy are basically insensitive to medium composition, and
are highly conserved even when the environment is enriched with nonessential
compounds or overconstrained to decrease maximum biomass formation.

Shnider and S. Sternberg and popularized by J.-L. Loday, has been generalized

Their
usefulness is manifested in all those situations where stationary information
carriers are involved. In the majority of the communication schemes relying on
quantum spin chains, the latter are assumed to be finite in length, with well
addressable end-chain spins. In this paper we propose that such configuration
could actually be achieved by a mechanism that is able to effectively cut a
spin ring through the insertion of bond defects. We then show how suitable
physical quantities can be identified as figures of merit for the effectiveness
of the cut. We find that, even for modest strengths of the bond defect, a ring
is effectively cut at the defect site. In turn, this has important effects on
the amount of correlations shared by the spins across the resulting chain,
which we study by means of a scattering-based mechanism of a clear physical
interpretation.

$\Gamma^{\omega }(K_{F},P_{F})$ (proportional to the Landau function) in a 2D
Fermi liquid (FL) near a $T=0$ instability towards antiferromagnetism. Previous
studies have found that near an instability, the system enters into a critical
FL regime, in which the fermionic self-energy is large near hot spots (points
on the Fermi surface connected by the antiferromagnetic ordering vector
$q_\pi=(\pi,\pi)$) and has much stronger dependence on frequency than on
momentum. We show that to properly calculate the vertex function in this regime
one has to sum up an infinite series of terms which were explicitly excluded in
the conventional treatment. Besides, we show that, to properly describe the
spin component of $\Gamma^{\omega }(K_{F},P_{F})$ even in an ordinary FL, one
has to include Aslamazov-Larkin terms. We show that the total $\Gamma^{\omega
}(K_{F},P_{F})$ is larger in a critical FL than in an ordinary FL, roughly by
an extra power of magnetic correlation length $\xi$. However, the enhancement
of $\Gamma ^{\omega }(K_{F},P_{F})$ is highly non-uniform: It holds only when,
for one of the two momentum variables, the distance from a hot spot along the
Fermi surface is much larger than for the other one. We show that the charge
and spin components of the total vertex function satisfy the universal
relations following from the Ward identities related to the conservation of the
particle number and the total spin. We find that the charge and spin components
of $\Gamma^{\omega }(K_{F},P_{F})$ are identical to leading order in the
magnetic correlation length. We derive the Landau parameters, the density of
states $N_F$, and the uniform ($q=0$) charge and spin susceptibilities $\chi
^{l=0}_{c} = \chi^{l=0}_s$. We show that the susceptibilities remain finite at
$\xi = \infty$ despite that $N_F$ diverges as $\log \xi$.

astrophysical phenomena. In dynamical problems the time-dependent equations of
radiation hydrodynamics have to be solved. We present a newly developed
radiation-hydrodynamics module specifically designed for the versatile MHD code
PLUTO. The solver is based on the flux-limited diffusion approximation in the
two-temperature approach. All equations are solved in the co-moving frame in
the frequency independent (grey) approximation. The hydrodynamics is solved by
the different Godunov schemes implemented in PLUTO, and for the radiation
transport we use a fully implicit scheme. The resulting system of linear
equations is solved either using the successive over-relaxation (SOR) method
(for testing purposes), or matrix solvers that are available in the PETSc
library. We state in detail the methodology and describe several test cases in
order to verify the correctness of our implementation. The solver works in
standard coordinate systems, such as Cartesian, cylindrical and spherical, and
also for non-equidistant grids. We have presented a new radiation-hydrodynamics
solver coupled to the MHD-code \PLUTO that is a modern, versatile and efficient
new module for treating complex radiation hydrodynamical problems in
astrophysics. As test cases, either purely radiative situations, or full
radiation-hydrodynamical setups (including radiative shocks and convection in
accretion discs) have been studied successfully. The new module scales very
well on parallel computers using MPI. For problems in star or planet formation,
we have added the possibility of irradiation by a central source.

only depend on the magnitude of T, but is anisotropic --- which we show by
varying the relative orientation of the probe and main flow. By studying the
depth dependence of the three characteristic torques that characterize the

enriched in carbon and slow neutron capture (s-process) elements and an evolved
white dwarf (WD) that is invisible at optical wavelengths. The youngest
observed barium stars are surrounded by planetary nebulae (PNe), ejected soon
after the wind accretion of polluted material when the WD was in its preceeding
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. Such systems are rare but powerful
laboratories for studying AGB nucleosynthesis as we can measure the chemical
abundances of both the polluted star and the nebula ejected by the polluter.
Here we present evidence for a barium star in the PN Hen 2-39. The polluted
giant is very similar to that found in WeBo 1. It is a cool (Teff=4250 +/- 150
K) giant enhanced in carbon ([C/H]=0.42 +/- 0.02 dex) and barium ([Ba/Fe]=1.50
+/- 0.25 dex). A spectral type of C-R3 C_24 nominally places Hen 2-39 amongst
the peculiar early R-type carbon stars, however the barium enhancement and
likely binary status mean that it is more likely to be a barium star with
similar properties, rather than a true member of this class. An AGB star model
of initial mass 1.8 Msun and a relatively large carbon pocket size can
reproduce the observed abundances well, provided mass is transferred in a
highly conservative way from the AGB star to the polluted star (e.g. wind
Roche-lobe overflow). The nebula exhibits an apparent ring morphology in
keeping with the other PNe around barium stars (WeBo 1 and A 70) and shows a
high degree of ionization implying the presence of an invisible hot pre-WD
companion that will require confirmation with UV observations. In contrast to A
70, the nebular chemical abundance pattern is consistent with non-Type I PNe,
in keeping with the trend found from nebular s-process studies that non-Type I
PNe are more likely to be s-process enhanced. (abridged)

calculations to obtain the energy level structure of the
electronic-vibrational-rotational states considered both in the absence and in
the presence of a magnetic field. Level mixing due to magnetic field
perturbation (the Paschen-Back effect) was consistently taken into account.
Then, we calculated frequencies and strengths of transitions between magnetic
sublevels. Employing these results and solving numerically a set of the
radiative transfer equations for polarized radiation, we calculated Stokes
parameters for both the individual lines and the (0,0) band depending on the
strength and orientation of the magnetic field. We demonstrate that magnetic
splitting of the individual CrH lines shows a significant asymmetry due to the
Paschen-Back effect already at 1 G field. This leads to a considerable signal
in both circular and linear polarization, up to 30 percent at the magnetic
field strength of more than 3 kG in early L dwarfs. The polarization does not
cancel out completely even at very low spectral resolution and is seen as
broad-band polarization of a few percent. Since the line asymmetry depends only
on the magnetic field strength and not on the filling factor, CrH lines provide
a very sensitive tool for direct measurement of the stellar magnetic fields on
faint cool objects, such as brown dwarfs and hot Jupiters, observed with low

eccentricity, since a decrease in perigee of only 5-10% would cause them to

from the Earth's multipole moments, the Moon, and the Sun that are not
spherically symmetric and hence do not conserve angular momentum, especially
over the tens of thousands of orbits made by a typical satellite. Why then do
satellites not crash? We describe a vector-based analysis of the long-term

single non-Keplerian perturbing potential. If only the quadrupole potential
from the Earth's equatorial bulge is present, all near-circular orbits are
stable. If only the octupole potential is present, all such orbits are

k-epsilon model is used to simulate high Reynolds number flows by increasing

the use of the k-epsilon model leads to five times less gas remaining after

consistent with what simple analytic calculations indicate. Hence the continual
Kelvin-Helmholtz stripping plays a significant role in the ram pressure

been confirmed in recent years. In this paper, we apply jitter radiation to
study the polarization feature of GRB prompt emission. In our framework,
relativistic electrons are accelerated by turbulent acceleration. Random and
small-scale magnetic fields are generated by turbulence. We further determine
that the polarization property of GRB prompt emission is governed by the
configuration of the random and small-scale magnetic fields. A two-dimensional
compressed slab, which contains stochastic magnetic fields, is applied in our
model. If the jitter condition is satisfied, the electron deflection angle in
the magnetic field is very small and the electron trajectory can be treated as
a straight line. A high-degree of polarization can be achieved when the angle
between the line of sight and the slab plane is small. Moreover, micro-emitters
with mini-jet structure are considered to be within a bulk GRB jet. The jet
""off-axis"" effect is intensely sensitive to the observed polarization degree.
We discuss the depolarization effect on GRB prompt emission and afterglow. We
also speculate that the rapid variability of GRB prompt polarization may be
correlated with the stochastic variability of the turbulent dynamo or the
magnetic reconnection of plasmas.

able to decisively rule out prominent absorption by TiO in the exoplanet's
atmosphere. Strong pressure-broadened Na and K absorption signatures are also
excluded, as are significant metal-hydride features. We compare our combined
broadband spectrum to a wide variety of existing aerosol-free atmospheric
models, though none are satisfactory fits. However, we do find that the full
transmission spectrum can be described by models which include significant
opacity from aerosols: including Rayleigh scattering, Mie scattering, tholin
haze, and settling dust profiles. The transmission spectrum follows an
effective extinction cross section with a power-law of index alpha, with the
slope of the transmission spectrum constraining the quantity alphaT =
-3528+/-660 K, where T is the atmospheric temperature. Rayleigh scattering
(alpha=-4) is among the best fitting models, though requires low terminator
temperatures near 900 K. Sub-micron size aerosol particles can provide equally
good fits to the entire transmission spectrum for a wide range of temperatures,
and we explore corundum as a plausible dust aerosol. The presence of
atmospheric aerosols also helps to explain the modestly bright albedo implied
by Spitzer observations, as well as the near black body nature of the emission
spectrum. Ti-bearing condensates on the cooler night-side is the most natural
explanation for the overall lack of TiO signatures in WASP-12b, indicating the
day/night cold-trap is an important effect for very hot Jupiters. These finding
indicate that aerosols can play a significant atmospheric role for the entire
wide range of hot-Jupiter atmospheres, potentially affecting their overall
spectrum and energy balance.(abridged)

propagating direction. This direction-dependent phase indicates the presence of
an effective magnetic field as shown for electrons experimentally in the
Aharonov-Bohm experiment. Here we replicate this experiment using photons. In
order to create this effective magnetic field, we construct an on-chip
silicon-based Ramsey-type interferometer. This interferometer has been
traditionally used to probe the phase of atomic states, and here we apply it to
probe the phase of photonic states. We experimentally observe a phase change,
i.e. an effective magnetic field flux from 0 to 2pi. In an Aharonov-Bohm
configuration for electrons, considering the device geometry, this flux
corresponds to an effective magnetic field of 0.2 Gauss.

occur both as labels encoded on the boundary of a ""volume"" and as complementary
aspects of geometric fluctuations within that volume. If you think of crotons
as linear combinations, then the scalars used are croton base numbers. Croton
base numbers can be combined to form the amplitudes and phases of Mersenne
fluctuations which, in turn, form qphyla. Volume normally requires space or
space-time as a prerequisite; in a pregeometric setting, however, ""volume"" is
represented by a qphyletic assembly. Various stages of pre-geometric
refinement, expressed through the aspects crotonic amplitude or phase, combine
to eventually form and/or dissolve sphere-packed chunks of Euclidean space. A
time-like crotonic refinement is a rough analog of temporal resolution in
tenacious time, whereas space-like crotonic refinement is analogous to spatial
resolution in sustained space. The analogy suggests a conceptual link between
the ever-expanding scope of Mersenne fluctuations and the creation and lifetime
patterns of massive elementary particles. A three-stage process of ideation,
organization and intraworldly action is introduced to back this up. In Part II,
the intrawordly aspect is analyzed first, including our preon model of
subnuclear structure, and the organizer aspect thereafter, based on three types
of Mersenne numbers, $M_{\textrm{reg}}$, $M_{5/8}$, $M_{9/8}$, and two formal
principles: juxtaposition $x$ vs. $\! x\!\pm\!1(2)$ and the interordinal
application of functional
$1\!\divideontimes(f^{(a)}\!\circ(f^{(b)}\!\divideontimes f^{(c)}))$.

conventional methods where the value function is regressed on a set of basis

regresses the value function on a set of basis functions valued at the end of

results hold on non-compact sets. We show that the Regress-Later method is

down, calling for specific protocols to extract and measure work. Usually, such

in a battery of finite energy : a hybrid optomechanical system. Such devices
consist in an optically active two-level quantum system interacting strongly
with a nano-mechanical oscillator that provides and stores mechanical work,
playing the role of the battery. We identify protocols where the battery
exchanges large, measurable amounts of work with the quantum emitter without
getting entangled with it. When the quantum emitter is coupled to a thermal
bath, we show that thermodynamic reversibility is attainable with
state-of-the-art devices, paving the road towards the realization of a full

particular, in PKS 1510-089 and 3C 454.3 a rotation of almost 90 degrees has
been observed after strong gamma-ray flares. The swing of the polarization
angle may be related either to the propagation of a shock along the jet that
orders the magnetic field, or a change of the opacity regime.

different magnetic configurations onto a Heisenberg Hamiltonian we compute the
magnetic exchange interaction parameters, J, between the nearest neighbor Co

inelastic neutron scattering intensities. Among four spin wave branches, the
lowest energy mode was found to have the largest scattering intensity at the
magnetic zone center, while the other modes becomes dominant at different

acyclic graph of tasks linked by directed dependency edges, and the tasks are
executed, possibly in parallel, in an order consistent with their dependencies.
A popular and effective way to extend fork-join parallelism is to allow threads
to create futures. A thread creates a future to hold the results of a
computation, which may or may not be executed in parallel. That result is
returned when some thread touches that future, blocking if necessary until the
result is ready.
  Recent research has shown that while futures can, of course, enhance
parallelism in a structured way, they can have a deleterious effect on cache
locality. In the worst case, futures can incur $\Omega(P T_\infty + t
T_\infty)$ deviations, which implies $\Omega(C P T_\infty + C t T_\infty)$
additional cache misses, where $C$ is the number of cache lines, $P$ is the
number of processors, $t$ is the number of touches, and $T_\infty$ is the
\emph{computation span}. Since cache locality has a large impact on software
performance on modern multicores, this result is troubling.
  In this paper, however, we show that if futures are used in a simple,
disciplined way, then the situation is much better: if each future is touched
only once, either by the thread that created it, or by a thread to which the
future has been passed from the thread that created it, then parallel
executions with work stealing can incur at most $O(C P T^2_\infty)$ additional
cache misses, a substantial improvement. This structured use of futures is
characteristic of many (but not all) parallel applications.

discuss the evolution of rotational invariants constructed from the velocity
gradient tensor. Compared with the traditional divergence-vorticity
decomposition, these invariants, defined as coefficients of characteristic
equation of the velocity gradient tensor, enable a complete classification of
all possible flow patterns in the dark-matter comoving frame, including both
potential and vortical flows. We show that this tool, first introduced in
turbulence two decades ago, proves to be very useful in understanding the
evolution of the cosmic web structure, and in classifying its morphology.
Before shell-crossing, different categories of potential flow are highly
associated with cosmic web structure, because of the coherent evolution of
density and velocity. This correspondence is even preserved at some level when
vorticity is generated after shell-crossing. The evolution from the potential
to vortical flow can be traced continuously by these invariants. With the help
of this tool, we show that the vorticity is generated in a particular way that
is highly correlated with the large-scale structure. This includes a distinct
spatial distribution and different types of alignment between cosmic web and
vorticity direction for various vortical flows. Incorporating shell-crossing
into closed dynamical systems is highly non-trivial, but we propose a possible
statistical explanation for some of these phenomena relating to the internal
structure of the three-dimensional invariants space.

Measurements of top quark pair production cross sections in several top quark
final states are reported. Moreover, cross sections for the electroweak
production of single top quarks in both t- and tW-channels are shown. The mass
of the top quark is extracted using several methods. Presented results also
include measurements of the W helicity in top decays, the top pair charge

problem. The problem is essentially a multi-hypothesis problem, with a
hypothesis for every division of the systems into normal and anomal systems.
The number of hypothesis grows rapidly with the number of systems and
approximate solutions become a necessity for any problems of practical
interests. In the current paper we take an optimization approach to this
multi-hypothesis problem. We first observe that the problem is equivalent to a
non-convex combinatorial optimization problem. We then relax the problem to a
convex problem that can be solved distributively on the systems and that stays
computationally tractable as the number of systems increase. An interesting
property of the proposed method is that it can under certain conditions be
shown to give exactly the same result as the combinatorial multi-hypothesis
problem and the relaxation is hence tight.

cosmologists. Recent results from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Project
(WMAP) indicate that the visible universe is incredibly flat. This apparent
flatness could be due to the fact that only a small part of the universe is
visible, thus indicating that the geometry of the universe is still an open and
an interesting problem in cosmology. Assuming a profound connection between
Friedmann, Robertson, Walker (FRW) geometries and thermodynamics, we construct
a parameter free exploratory model that allows us to predict the geometry of
the universe by thermodynamic arguments. The key parameters in this model are
the concept of global equation of state and the concept of gravitational
temperature. By comparing the equal time expansion of the Green function for
the massless conformal scalar field in background FRW geometry with the thermal
Green function in Minkowski space-time, we define the gravitational
temperature. We also give the protocol for determining the global equation of
state for a given local equation of state. Using a local equation of state that
covers a wide range of physically acceptable cases,
P={\alpha}{\rho},{\alpha}>0, and within the context of FRW thermodynamics, we
predict that the geometry of the visible universe is Lobachevskian (open),
albeit being very close to flat. This is consistent with the WMAP data, which
indicates that the universe may deviate from flatness by as much as 1%. We also
discuss the self-consistency of this suggestive model along with its possible
connections with nonextensive thermodynamics and black hole thermodynamics.

north and south magnetic pole locations and the magnetic opening during

The polar plume orientation is determined by applying the Hough-wavelet
transform to a series of EUV images and extracting the key Hough space
parameters of the resulting maps. The same procedure is applied to the polar
cap field inclination derived from extrapolating magnetograms generated by a
surface flux transport model. We observe that the position where the magnetic
field is radial (the Sun's magnetic poles) reflects the global organization of
magnetic field on the solar surface, and we suggest that this opens the
possibility of both detecting flux emergence anywhere on the solar surface
(including the far side) and better constraining the reorganization of the
corona after flux emergence.

audience measurements as macroscopic quantities such as television program
rating point or the so-called gross rating point (GRP for short) are

Assuming that each viewer decides the television station to watch by means of
three factors, namely, physical constraints on television controllers,
exogenous information such as advertisement of program by television station,
and endogenous information given by `word-of-mouth communication' through the
past market history, we shall construct an aggregation probability of
Gibbs-Boltzmann-type with the energy function. We discuss the possibility for
the ingredients of the model system to exhibit the collective behavior due to

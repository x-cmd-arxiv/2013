both X-ray binaries (XRBs) and type-1 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). It was
suggested that the distortion of the Fe K_alpha emission results from Doppler
and relativistic effects affecting the radiative transfer close to the strong
gravitational well of the central compact object: a stellar mass black hole
(BH) or neutron star (NS) in the case of XRBs, or a super massive black hole
(SMBH) in the case of AGN. However, alternative approaches based on
reprocessing and transmission of radiation through surrounding media also
attempt to explain the line broadening. So far, spectroscopic and timing
analyzes have not yet convinced the whole community to discriminate between the
two scenarios. Here we study to which extent X-ray polarimetric measurements of
black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs) and type-1 AGN could help to identify the
possible origin of the line distortion. To do so, we report on recent
simulations obtained for the two BH flavors and show that the proposed
scenarios are found to behave differently in polarization degree and
polarization angle. A relativistic origin for the distortion is found to be
more probable in the context of BHXRBs, supporting the idea that the same
mechanism should lead the way also for AGN. We show that the discriminating
polarization signal could have been detectable by several X-ray polarimetry
missions proposed in the past.

However, it is not clear if the observed emission features and the Compton hump
are associated with relativistic reflection onto the accretion disc, or complex
absorption by distant, absorbing gas clouds passing by the observer's
line-of-sight. Here, we investigate these two scenarios under the scope of
X-ray polarimetry, providing the first polarisation predictions for an
archetypal ""changing look"" AGN: NGC 1365. We explore the resulting polarisation
emerging from lamp-post emission and scattering off an accretion disc in the
immediate vicinity of a supermassive black hole. The computed polarisation
signatures are compared to the results of an absorption-dominated model, where
high column density gas partially covers the central source. While the shape of
the polarisation spectrum is similar, the two models differ in net polarisation
percentage, with the relativistic reflection scenario producing significantly
stronger polarisation. Additionally, the variation of the polarisation position
angle is distinctly different between both scenarios: the reflection-dominated
model produces smooth rotations of the polarisation angle with photon energy
whereas circumnuclear absorption causes an orthogonal switch of the
polarisation angle between the soft and the hard X-ray bands. By comparing the
predicted polarisation of NGC 1365 to the detectability levels of X-ray
polarimetry mission concepts proposed in the past, we demonstrate that with a
large, soft X-ray observatory or a medium-sized mission equipped with a hard (6

expected to get modified at low spacelike momenta 0 < Q^2 < 1 GeV^2 so that,
instead of having unphysical (Landau) singularities it remains smooth and
finite there, due to infared (IR) fixed point. This behavior is suggested by:
Gribov-Zwanziger approach, Dyson-Schwinger equations (DSE) and other functional
methods, lattice calculations, light-front holographic mapping AdS/CFT modified
by a dilaton background, and by most of the analytic (holomorphic) QCD models.
All such couplings, A(Q^2), differ from the pQCD couplings a(Q^2) at |Q| > 1
GeV by nonperturbative (NP) terms, typically by some power-suppressed terms
~1/(Q^2)^N. Evaluations of low-energy physical QCD quantities in terms of such
A(Q^2) couplings (with IR fixed point) at a level beyond one-loop are usually
performed with (truncated) power series in A(Q^2). We argue that such an
evaluation is not correct, because the NP terms in general get out of control
as the number of terms in the power series increases. The series consequently
become increasingly unstable under the variation of the renormalization scale,
and have a fast asymptotic divergent behavior compounded by the renormalon
problem. We argue that an alternative series in terms of logarithmic
derivatives of A(Q^2) should be used. Further, a Pad\'e-related resummation
based on this series gives results which are renormalization scale independent
and show very good convergence. Timelike low-energy observables can be
evaluated analogously, using the integral transformation which relates the
timelike observable with the corresponding spacelike observable.

correlated phenomena such as doubly excited states, autoionization, Fano

Equations of motion (EOM) for natural orbitals and their occupation numbers
have been derived earlier. We show that by using renormalized natural orbitals
(RNO) both can be combined into one equation governed by a hermitian effective
Hamiltonian. We specialize on the two-electron spin-singlet system, known as
being a ""worst case"" testing ground for TDDFT, and employ the widely used,
numerically exactly solvable, one-dimensional helium model atom (in a laser

the RNO is plagued by instabilities, and resorting to linear response is not an
option for the ultimate goal to study nonperturbative dynamics in intense laser

interest in its potential application in superconducting radio frequency
accelerating cavities. However, compared to traditional Nb cavities, the
viability of MgB2 at high rf fields is still open to question. Our approach is
to study the nonlinear electrodynamics of the material under localized rf
magnetic fields. Because of the presence of the small superconducting gap in
the $\pi$ band, the nonlinear response of MgB2 at low temperature is
potentially complicated compared to a single-gap s-wave superconductor such as
Nb. Understanding the mechanisms of nonlinearity coming from the two-band
structure of MgB2, as well as extrinsic sources of nonlinearity, is an urgent
requirement. A localized and strong rf magnetic field, created by a magnetic
write head, is integrated into our nonlinear-Meissner-effect scanning microwave
microscope [Tamin Tai, X. X. Xi, C. G. Zhuang, D. I. Mircea, and S. M. Anlage,

fabricated by a hybrid physical-chemical vapor deposition technique on
dielectric substrates, are measured at a fixed location and show a strongly
temperature-dependent third harmonic response. We propose that several possible
mechanisms are responsible for this nonlinear response.

Four hundred and fifty years ago, Jean-Dominique Cassini did a similar study on
a closer object: Saturn. After joining the newly created Observatoire de Paris
in 1671, he discovered 4 of Saturn's satellites (Iapetus, Rhea, Tethys and
Dione), and also the gap in its rings. He made these discoveries observing
through the best optics at the time, made in Italy by famous opticians like
Giuseppe Campani or Eustachio Divini. But was he really able to observe this
black line in Saturn's rings? That is what a team of optical scientists from
Observatoire de Paris - LESIA with the help of Onera and Institut d'Optique
tried to find out, analyzing the lenses used by Cassini, and still preserved in
the collection of the observatory. The main difficulty was that even if the
lenses have diameters between 84 and 239 mm, the focal lengths are between 6
and 50 m, more than the focal lengths of the primary mirrors of future ELTs.
The analysis shows that the lenses have an exceptionally good quality, with a
wavefront error of approximately 50 nm rms and 200 nm peak-to-valley, leading
to Strehl ratios higher than 0.8. Taking into account the chromaticity of the
glass, the wavefront quality and atmospheric turbulence, reconstructions of his
observations tend to show that he was actually able to see the division named

described by Anderson impurity models with an on-site interaction $U$ which are
capacitively coupled by an interdot interaction $U_{12}<U$. The low energy

be deduced from an analysis of the fixed point in a numerical renormalization

freedom become degenerate, the free quasiparticle excitations have a phase
shift of $\pi/4$ and a 4-fold degeneracy. We find, however, when the
quasiparticle interactions are included, that the low energy effective model
has SU(4) symmetry only in the special case $U_{12}=U$ unless both $U$ and
$U_{12}$ are greater than $D$, the half-bandwidth of the conduction electron

differential conductance observed in recent experiments can be described by a
quasiparticle density of states with temperature dependent renormalized

unavoidable for wave packets. We find, starting from simple examples,
proceeding with their generalizations and finally by considering the continuity

of the wave packet, just as in the case of an ensemble of classical particles.

in a high-energy neutron beamline that is part of the Los Alamos Neutron
Science Center to measure cross-sections of spallation products that are
backgrounds to measurements of neutrinos from a supernova burst, cross-sections
of events that mimic the electron neutrino appearance signal in long-baseline
neutrino physics and neutron signatures to constrain neutrino energy
reconstruction in LBNE's long-baseline program. Subsequent to the neutron
running, the CAPTAIN detector will be moved to a neutrino source. Two
possibilities are an on-axis run in the NuMI beamline at FNAL and a run in the
neutrino source produced by the SNS. An on-axis run at NuMI produces more than
one million events of interest in a two or three year run at neutrino energies
between 1 and 10 GeV - complementary to the MicroBooNE experiment, which will
measure similar interactions at a lower energy range - 0.5 to 2 GeV. At the SNS
the neutrinos result from the decays stopped positively charged pions and muons
yielding a broad spectrum up to 50 MeV. If located close to the spallation
target, CAPTAIN can detect several thousand events per year in the same
neutrino energy regime where neutrinos from a supernova burst are. Measurements
at the SNS yield a first measurement of the cross- section of neutrinos on
argon in this important energy regime.

using two different approximations: the shallow water model, and the Boussinesq
model with weak dispersion. The equations for both models were solved using
periodic grids with up to $2048^2$ points. In all simulations, the Froude
number varies between $0.015$ and $0.05$, while the Reynolds number and level
of dispersion are varied in a broader range to span different regimes. In all
cases, most of the energy in the system remains in the waves, even after
integrating the system for very long times. For shallow flows, non-linear waves
are non-dispersive and the spectrum of potential energy is compatible with
$\sim k^{-2}$ scaling. For deeper (Boussinesq) flows, the non-linear dispersion
relation as directly measured from the wave and frequency spectrum (calculated
independently) shows signatures of dispersion, and the spectrum of potential
energy is compatible with predictions of weak turbulence theory, $\sim
k^{-4/3}$. In this latter case, the non-linear dispersion relation differs from
the linear one and has two branches, which we explain with a simple qualitative
argument. Finally, we study probability density functions of the surface height
and find that in all cases the distributions are asymmetric. The probability
density function can be approximated by a skewed normal distribution as well as
by a Tayfun distribution.

there is no lower critical dimension for the model. Moreover, even for

high-temperature plasmas with a strong guide field is analyzed on the basis of
a two-dimensional gyrofluid model. The linear growth rate of the reconnecting
instability is compared to analytical calculations over the whole spectrum of
linearly unstable wave numbers. In the strongly unstable regime (large \Delta
'), the nonlinear evolution of the reconnecting instability is found to undergo
two distinctive acceleration phases separated by a stall phase in which the
instantaneous growth rate decreases. The first acceleration phase is caused by
the formation of strong electric fields close to the X-point due to ion
gyration, while the second acceleration phase is driven by the development of
an open Petschek-like configuration due to both ion and electron temperature
effects. Furthermore, the maximum instantaneous growth rate is found to
increase dramatically over its linear value for decreasing diffusion layers.
This is a consequence of the fact that the peak instantaneous growth rate
becomes weakly dependent on the microscopic plasma parameters if the diffusion
region thickness is sufficiently smaller than the equilibrium magnetic field
scale length. When this condition is satisfied, the peak reconnection rate
asymptotes to a constant value.

the precision matrix is obtained. The posterior distribution on the model space
is extremely cumbersome to compute. We propose a fast computational method for
approximating the posterior probabilities of various graphs using the Laplace

appeal and simplicity of the nearest neighbor rule: given a set of samples in
some metric domain space whose value under some function is known, we estimate
the function anywhere in the domain by giving the value of the nearest sample
per the metric. More generally, one may use the modal value of the m nearest
samples, where m is a fixed positive integer (although m=1 is known to be
admissible in the sense that no larger value is asymptotically superior in
terms of prediction error). The nearest neighbor rule is nonparametric and
extremely general, requiring in principle only that the domain be a metric
space. The classic paper on the technique, proving convergence under
independent, identically-distributed (iid) sampling, is due to Cover and Hart
(1967). Because taking samples is costly, there has been much research in
recent years on selective sampling, in which each sample is selected from a
pool of candidates ranked by a heuristic; the heuristic tries to guess which
candidate would be the most ""informative"" sample. Lindenbaum et al. (2004)
apply selective sampling to the nearest neighbor rule, but their approach
sacrifices the austere generality of Cover and Hart; furthermore, their
heuristic algorithm is complex and computationally expensive. Here we report
recent results that enable selective sampling in the original Cover-Hart
setting. Our results pose three selection heuristics and prove that their
nearest neighbor rule predictions converge to the true pattern. Two of the
algorithms are computationally cheap, with complexity growing linearly in the
number of samples. We believe that these results constitute an important
advance in the art.

the cloud model of G2, the radio flux of the forward shock is predicted to be
much larger than the quiescent radio flux and therefore should have already
been detected (Narayan et al. 2012; Sadowski et al. 2013b). Therefore, radio
measurements can reveal the nature of G2 well before G2 completes its periapsis

filamentary structures that have yet to form stars, largely avoiding the dense
gas associated with small protostellar groups and the main central cluster of
Serpens South. Where detected, the HC7N abundances are similar to those found
in other nearby star forming regions. Toward some HC7N `clumps', we find
consistent variations in the line centroids relative to NH3 (1,1) emission, as
well as systematic increases in the HC7N non-thermal line widths, which we
argue reveal infall motions onto dense filaments within Serpens South with
minimum mass accretion rates of M ~ 2-5 M_sun Myr^-1. The relative abundance of
NH3 to HC7N suggests that the HC7N is tracing gas that has been at densities n
~ 10^4 cm^-3, for timescales t < 1-2 x 10^5 yr. Since HC7N emission peaks are
rarely co-located with those of either NH3 or continuum, it is likely that
Serpens South is not particularly remarkable in its abundance of HC7N, but
instead the serendipitous mapping of HC7N simultaneously with NH3 has allowed
us to detect HC7N at low abundances in regions where it otherwise may not have
been looked for. This result extends the known star-forming regions containing
significant HC7N emission from typically quiescent regions, like the Taurus
molecular cloud, to more complex, active environments.

be stable for all optimal parameter sets. To that end we conducted a global

  with some new results",,,,"cs.DS cs.CC math.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The isomorphism problem for finite groups of order n (GpI) has long been
known to be solvable in $n^{\log n+O(1)}$ time, but only recently were
polynomial-time algorithms designed for several interesting group classes.
Inspired by recent progress, we revisit the strategy for GpI via the extension
theory of groups.
  The extension theory describes how a normal subgroup N is related to G/N via
G, and this naturally leads to a divide-and-conquer strategy that splits GpI
into two subproblems: one regarding group actions on other groups, and one
regarding group cohomology. When the normal subgroup N is abelian, this
strategy is well-known. Our first contribution is to extend this strategy to
handle the case when N is not necessarily abelian. This allows us to provide a
unified explanation of all recent polynomial-time algorithms for special group
classes.
  Guided by this strategy, to make further progress on GpI, we consider
central-radical groups, proposed in Babai et al. (SODA 2011): the class of
groups such that G mod its center has no abelian normal subgroups. This class
is a natural extension of the group class considered by Babai et al. (ICALP
2012), namely those groups with no abelian normal subgroups. Following the
above strategy, we solve GpI in $n^{O(\log \log n)}$ time for central-radical
groups, and in polynomial time for several prominent subclasses of
central-radical groups. We also solve GpI in $n^{O(\log\log n)}$ time for
groups whose solvable normal subgroups are elementary abelian but not
necessarily central. As far as we are aware, this is the first time there have
been worst-case guarantees on a $n^{o(\log n)}$-time algorithm that tackles
both aspects of GpI---actions and cohomology---simultaneously.

leads to the formation of complex structures with an effective dimension higher
than that of the space where the actual displacements take place. Furthermore,

*how* complex, according to that measure, that particular behavior is. It can
be expected that different complexity measures from possibly entirely different
fields are related to each other in a non-trivial fashion. Here we study small
Turing machines (TMs) with two symbols, and two and three states. For any
particular such machine $\tau$ and any particular input $x$ we consider what we
call the 'space-time' diagram which is the collection of consecutive tape
configurations of the computation $\tau(x)$. In our setting, we define fractal
dimension of a Turing machine as the limiting fractal dimension of the
corresponding space-time diagram. It turns out that there is a very strong
relation between the fractal dimension of a Turing machine of the
above-specified type and its runtime complexity. In particular, a TM with three
states and two colors runs in at most linear time iff its dimension is 2, and
its dimension is 1 iff it runs in super-polynomial time and it uses polynomial
space. If a TM runs in time $O(x^n)$ we have empirically verified that the
corresponding dimension is $(n+1)/n$, a result that we can only partially
prove. We find the results presented here remarkable because they relate two
completely different complexity measures: the geometrical fractal dimension on
the one side versus the time complexity of a computation on the other side.

especially when electronic correlations are strong. In layered compounds, such
as La2-xSrxNiO4 and La2-xBaxCuO4, the doped charge carriers can segregate into
periodically-spaced charge stripes separating narrow domains of
antiferromagnetic order. Although there have been theoretical proposals of
dynamically fluctuating stripes, direct spectroscopic evidence of charge-stripe
fluctuations has been lacking. Here we report the detection of critical lattice
fluctuations, driven by charge-stripe correlations, in La2-xSrxNiO4 using
inelastic neutron scattering. This scattering is detected at large momentum
transfers where the magnetic form factor suppresses the spin fluctuation
signal. The lattice fluctuations associated with the dynamic charge stripes are
narrow in q and broad in energy. They are strongest near the charge stripe
melting temperature. Our results open the way towards the quantitative theory
of dynamic stripes and for directly detecting dynamical charge stripes in other
strongly-correlated systems, including high-temperature superconductors such as
La2-xSrxCuO4.

hierarchical approach in which we model the distribution of the weights of the
nonsampled units in the population and simultaneously include them as
predictors in a nonparametric Gaussian process regression. We use simulation
studies to evaluate the performance of our procedure and compare it to the
classical design-based estimator. We apply our method to the Fragile Family and
Child Wellbeing Study. Our studies find the Bayesian nonparametric finite
population estimator to be more robust than the classical design-based
estimator without loss in efficiency, which works because we induce
regularization for small cells and thus this is a way of automatically
smoothing the highly variable weights.

pions were detected using the endcap electromagnetic calorimeter in the STAR
detector at RHIC. The cross section was measured over a transverse momentum
range of 5 < p_T < 16 GeV/c and is found to be within the scale uncertainty of
a next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculation. The longitudinal
double-spin asymmetry, A_LL, is measured in the same pseudorapidity range. This
quantity is sensitive to the gluonic contribution to the proton spin,
{\Delta}g(x), at low Bjorken-x (down to x approx 0.01), where it is less
constrained by measurements at central pseudorapidity. The measured A_LL is
consistent with model predictions. The parity-violating asymmetry, A_L, is also
measured and found to be consistent with zero. The transverse single-spin
asymmetry, A_N, is measured within a previously unexplored kinematic range in
Feynman-x and p_T. Such measurements may aid our understanding of the on-set
and kinematic dependence of the large asymmetries observed at more forward
pseudorapidity ({\eta} approx 3) and their underlying mechanisms. The A_N
results presented are consistent with a twist-3 model prediction of a small
asymmetry within the present kinematic range.

tools that implement the many analysis and visualization methods for different
scientific fields, is highly specialized, purpose-built for a research project,
and has to rely on community uptake and reuse for its continued development and
maintenance. Although uptake cannot be controlled over even guaranteed, some of
the key factors that influence whether new users or developers decide to adopt
an existing tool or start a new one are about how easy or difficult it is to
use or enhance a tool for a purpose for which it was not originally designed.
The science of software engineering has produced techniques and practices that
would reduce or remove a variety of barriers to community uptake of software,
but for a variety of reasons employing trained software engineers as part of
the development of long tail scientific software has proven to be challenging.
As a consequence, community uptake of long tail tools is often far more
difficult than it would need to be, even though opportunities for reuse abound.
We discuss likely reasons why employing software engineering in the long tail
is challenging, and propose that many of those obstacles could be addressed in
the form of a cross-cutting non-profit center of excellence that makes software
engineering broadly accessible as a shared service, conceptually and in its
effect similar to shared instrumentation.

classical analog. In this paper, we show that the observed stability is a
result of the physics of the QPC and the nature of the experiment. We show that
the same stability can indeed be reproduced classically, or quantum
mechanically. In addition, we explore the stability of the branched flow with

estimation, distributed learning and adaptation etc.) proliferate and
efficiently operate, the participating agents need to collaborate with each
other by repeatedly sharing information. However, sharing information is often
costly for the agents while resulting in no direct immediate benefit for them.
Hence, lacking incentives to collaborate, strategic agents who aim to maximize
their own individual utilities will withhold rather than share information,
leading to inefficient operation or even collapse of networks. In this paper,
we develop a systematic framework for designing distributed rating protocols
aimed at incentivizing the strategic agents to collaborate with each other by
sharing information. The proposed incentive protocols exploit the ongoing
nature of the agents' interactions to assign ratings and through them,
determine future rewards and punishments: agents that have behaved as directed
enjoy high ratings -- and hence greater future access to the information of
others; agents that have not behaved as directed enjoy low ratings -- and hence
less future access to the information of others. Unlike existing rating
protocols, the proposed protocol operates in a distributed manner, online, and
takes into consideration the underlying interconnectivity of agents as well as
their heterogeneity. We prove that in many deployment scenarios the price of
anarchy (PoA) obtained by adopting the proposed rating protocols is one. In
settings in which the PoA is larger than one, we show that the proposed rating
protocol still significantly outperforms existing incentive mechanisms such as
Tit-for-Tat. Importantly, the proposed rating protocols can also operate
efficiently in deployment scenarios where the strategic agents interact over
time-varying network topologies where new agents join the network over time.

two decades in frequency. The current radio data show a steepening of the
spectrum at higher frequencies, which has implications for models of the radio
halo origin. There is an on-going debate on the possibility that the observed
steepening is not intrinsic to the emitted radiation, but is instead caused by
the SZ effect. Recently, the Planck satellite measured the SZ signal and its
spatial distribution in the Coma cluster allowing to test this hypothesis.
Using the Planck results, we calculated the modification of the radio halo
spectrum by the SZ effect in three different ways. With the first two methods
we measured the SZ-decrement within the aperture radii used for flux
measurements of the halo at the different frequencies. First we adopted the
global compilation of data from Thierbach et al. and a reference aperture
radius consistent with those used by the various authors. Second we used the
available brightness profiles of the halo at different frequencies to derive
the spectrum within two fixed apertures, and derived the SZ-decrement using
these apertures. As a third method we used the quasi-linear correlation between
the y and the radio-halo brightness at 330 MHz discovered by Planck to derive
the modification of the radio spectrum by the SZ-decrement in a way that is
almost independent of the adopted aperture radius. We found that the spectral
modification induced by the SZ-decrement is 4-5 times smaller than that
necessary to explain the observed steepening. Consequently a break or cut-off
in the spectrum of the emitting electrons is necessary to explain current data.
We also show that, if a steepening is absent from the emitted spectrum, future
deep observations at 5 GHz with single dishes are expected to measure a halo
flux in a 40 arcmin radius that would be 7-8 times higher than currently seen.

used as important measures of keystream strength, hence designing a sequence
with high linear complexity and $k$-error linear complexity is a popular
research topic in cryptography. In this paper, the concept of stable $k$-error
linear complexity is proposed to study sequences with stable and large
$k$-error linear complexity. In order to study k-error linear complexity of
binary sequences with period $2^n$, a new tool called cube theory is developed.
By using the cube theory, one can easily construct sequences with the maximum
stable $k$-error linear complexity. For such purpose, we first prove that a
binary sequence with period $2^n$ can be decomposed into some disjoint cubes
and further give a general decomposition approach. Second, it is proved that
the maximum $k$-error linear complexity is $2^n-(2^l-1)$ over all
$2^n$-periodic binary sequences, where $2^{l-1}\le k<2^{l}$. Thirdly, a
characterization is presented about the $t$th ($t>1$) decrease in the $k$-error
linear complexity for a $2^n$-periodic binary sequence $s$ and this is a
continuation of Kurosawa et al. recent work for the first decrease of k-error
linear complexity. Finally, A counting formula for $m$-cubes with the same
linear complexity is derived, which is equivalent to the counting formula for
$k$-error vectors. The counting formula of $2^n$-periodic binary sequences
which can be decomposed into more than one cube is also investigated, which
extends an important result by Etzion et al..

urban site in western Japan, and filter samples of total suspended particulate
matter were collected every 24-h and analyzed for concentration and stable
carbon isotope ratio (delta13C) of low volatile water-soluble organic carbon
(LV-WSOC). Concentration of major chemical species in fine aerosol (<1.0
micron) was also measured in real time by Aerodyne aerosol mass spectrometers.
Oxidation state of organic aerosol was evaluated using the proportion of signal
at m/z 44 (fragment ions of carboxyl group) to the sum of all m/z signals of
organic mass spectra (f44). Analyses show a high correlation between LV-WSOC
and m/z 44 concentrations, suggesting that the LV-WSOC is likely associated
with water soluble carboxylic acids in the fine aerosol. Plots of delta13C of
LV-WSOC versus f44 exhibit systematic trends at the rural sites and random
variation at the urban site. The systematic trends qualitatively agree with a
simple binary mixture model of secondary organic aerosol and background LV-WSOC
that has delta13C of -17 permil or higher and f44 of approximately 0.06,
respectively. Comparison with references suggests that the source of background
LV-WSOC is likely biomass burning of C4 plants.

of the Tangled Nature Model (TNM) of biological evolution to show that
punctuated equilibria successively generated by the model's dynamics have
increasing entropy and are separated by increasing entropic barriers. We
further show that these states are organized in a hierarchy and that limiting
the values of possible interactions to a finite interval leads to stationary
fluctuations within a component of the latter. A coarse-grained description
based on the temporal statistics of quakes, the events leading from one
component of the hierarchy to the next, accounts for the logarithmic growth of
the population and the decaying rate of change of macroscopic variables.
Finally, we question the role of fitness in large scale evolution models and
speculate on the possible evolutionary role of rejuvenation and memory effects.

is characterized by the vacuum expectation value of the operator of creation of
the conserved quantum number Q, has the time-dependent order parameter.
However, the breaking of the time reversal symmetry is observable only if the
charge Q is not strictly conserved and may decay. This dihotomy is resolved in
systems with quasi-ODLRO. These systems have two well separated relaxation
times: the relaxation time \tau_Q of the charge Q and the energy relaxation
time \tau_E. If \tau_Q >> \tau_E, the perturbed system relaxes first to the
state with the ODLRO, which persists for a long time \tau_Q and finally relaxes
to the full equilibrium static state. In the limit \tau_Q -> \infty, but not in
the strict limit case when the charge Q is conserved, the intermediate ODLRO
state can be considered as the ground state of the system at fixed Q with the
observable spontaneously broken time reversal symmetry. Examples of systems

problem is to design a collection of tours for a fixed fleet of vehicles with

the vehicle loads are balanced. The unbalanced loads cause the decrease of
distribution quality especially in business environments and exibility in the

algorithms. When the demands are equal, we present a (1-1/Q)p+3/2approximation

approximation ratio for the tree metrics since an optimal solution can be found
for the TSP on a tree. We present an improved 2 approximation algorithm. When
the demands are unequal, we focus on obtaining approximate solutions since
finding balanced loads is NP-complete. We propose an algorithm that provides a
4 approximation for the balance of the loads. We assume a second approach to
get around the difficulties of the feasibility. In this approach, we redefine

analytical solutions have both the primary and secondary circulation in a

three intrinsic radiuses for the axisymmetrically ideal incompressible flow.
The first one is the radius of maximum primary circular velocity $r_m$. The
second one is radius of the primary kernel $r_k>r_m$, across which the
vorticity of the primary circulation changes sign and the vertical velocity
changes direction. The last one is the radius of the maximum primary vorticity
$r_d$, at which the vertical flow of the secondary circulation approaches its
maximum, and across which the radius velocity changes sign. The first TC-like
vortex solution has universal inflow or outflow. The relations between the
intrinsic length scales are $r_k=\sqrt{2}r_m$ and $r_d=2r_m$. The second one is
a multi-planar solution, periodically in $z$-coordinate. Within each layer, the
solution is a convection vortex. The number of the secondary circulation might
be one, two, three, and even more. There are also three intrinsic radiuses
$r_m$, $r_k$ and $r_d$, but they have different values. It seems that the
relative stronger radius velocity could be easily found near boundaries. The

Finally, we numerically optimize networks with a fixed degree sequence with

effects of inertia and spatial dimension on sheared disordered solids in the
athermal, quasistatic limit. In all cases the distribution of avalanche sizes
follows a power law over at least three orders of magnitude in dissipated
energy or stress drop. Scaling exponents are determined using finite-size
scaling for systems with thousands to millions of particles. Three distinct
universality classes are identified corresponding to overdamped and underdamped
limits, as well as a crossover damping that separates the two regimes. For each
universality class, the exponent describing the avalanche distributions is the
same in two and three dimensions. The spatial extent of plastic damage is
proportional to the energy dissipated in an avalanche. Both rise much more
rapidly with system size in the underdamped limit where inertia is important.
Inertia also lowers the mean energy of configurations sampled by the system and
leads to an excess of large events like that seen in earthquake distributions
for individual faults. The distribution of stress values during shear narrows
to zero with increasing system size and may provide useful information about
the size of elemental events in experimental systems. For overdamped and
crossover systems the stress variation scales inversely with the square root of
the system size. For underdamped systems the variation is determined by the
size of the largest events.

consists of Heisenberg couplings between nearest and next-nearest neighbor
spins, and biquadratic couplings between nearest neighbors. We use a
combination of variational calculations and classical Monte Carlo simulations
to study this model at zero and finite temperatures. We show that even an
arbitrarily weak biquadratic coupling plays a crucial role in selecting the
magnetic ground state. More importantly, a non-collinear magnetic state,
characterized by a finite spin current, is stable at finite temperatures. The
interesting aspect is that the present model neither includes an
inversion-symmetry-breaking term nor the effects of lattice distortions in the
Hamiltonian. We conclude that non-collinear magnetism at high temperatures, as
observed in CuO, can be explained via pure spin Hamiltonians. We find that the
spiral phase is inhomogeneous, and is stabilized by entropic effects. Our study
demonstrates that higher order interaction terms are of crucial importance if
the stronger interactions together with the lattice geometry contemplate to
generate a near degeneracy of magnetic states. The conclusions presented in

processes, including economic integration, globalization, and financial crises.
Of particular interest is understanding whether the temporal evolution of a
real economic network is in a (quasi-)stationary equilibrium, i.e.
characterized by smooth structural changes rather than abrupt transitions.
Smooth changes in quasi-equilibrium networks can be generally controlled for,
and largely predicted, via an appropriate rescaling of structural quantities,
while this is generally not possible for abrupt transitions in non-stationary
networks. Here we study whether real economic networks are in or out of
equilibrium by checking their consistency with quasi-equilibrium
maximum-entropy ensembles of graphs. As illustrative examples, we consider the
International Trade Network (ITN) and the Dutch Interbank Network (DIN). We
show that, despite the globalization process, the ITN is an almost perfect
example of quasi-equilibrium network, while the DIN is clearly an
out-of-equilibrium network undergoing major structural changes and displaying
non-stationary dynamics. Among the out-of-equilibrium properties of the DIN, we
find striking early-warning signals of the interbank crisis of 2008.

Typical three-wave nonlinear interactions among the involved OAM modes are
studied with the help of coupling wave equations. Being different from normal
QPM process where the energy and quasi-momentum conservations are satisfied,
both of the azimuthal and radial indices of the OAM states keep constant in
most of the cases. However, abnormal change of the radial index is observed
when there is asynchronous nonlinear conversion in different parts of the
beams. The QPM nonlinear evolution of fractional OAM states is also discussed
showing some interesting properties. In comparison with the traditional

rising of inertial particles in a two-dimensional convection flow. When memory
effects are neglected, the system exhibits rich dynamics, including periodic,
quasi-periodic and chaotic attractors. Here we show that when the full
advection dynamics is considered, including the history force, both the nature
and the number of attractors change, and a fractalization of their basins of
attraction appears. In particular, we show that the history force significantly
weakens the horizontal diffusion and changes the speed of sedimentation or
rising. The influence of the history force is dependent on the size of the
advected particles, being stronger for larger particles.

form $\omega$, corresponding loop space ($LM=C^\infty(S^1,M)$) admits a weak
symplectic form $\Omega^\omega$. We prove that the loop space over $\mbr^n$
admits Darboux chart for the weak symplectic structure $\Omega^\omega$.
Further, we show that inclusion map from the symplectic cohomology (as defined
by Kriegl and Michor \cite{KM}) of the loop space over $\mathbb R^n$ to the De
Rham cohomology of the loop space is an isomorphism.

binary Fe-Al alloys with different Al contents have been studied by the
measurements of positron lifetime spectra, coincidence Doppler broadening
spectra of positron annihilation radiation and Mossbauer spectra. The results
show that on increasing the Al content in Fe-Al alloys, the mean positron
lifetime of the alloys increase, while the mean electron density of the alloys
decrease. The increase of Al content in binary Fe-Al alloys will decrease the
amount of unpaired 3d electrons; as a consequence the probability of positron
annihilation with 3d electrons and the hyperfine field decrease rapidly.
Mossbauer spectra of binary Fe-Al alloys with Al content less than 25at% show
discrete sextets, these alloys give ferromagnetic contribution at room
temperature. The M\""ossbauer spectrum of Fe70Al30 shows a broad singlet. As Al
content higher than 40 at%, the M\""ossbauer spectra of these alloys are
singlet, that is, the alloys are paramagnetic. The behavior of 3d electron and
its effect on the hyperfine field of the binary Fe-Al alloy has been discussed.

storage and analysis platforms have arisen to fill gaps in performance and
capability left by conventional approaches built on traditional database
technologies and query languages. Many of these platforms apply graph
structures and analysis techniques to enable users to ingest, update, query and
compute on the topological structure of these relationships represented as
set(s) of edges between set(s) of vertices. To store and process Facebook-scale
datasets, they must be able to support data sources with billions of edges,
update rates of millions of updates per second, and complex analysis kernels.
These platforms must provide intuitive interfaces that enable graph experts and
novice programmers to write implementations of common graph algorithms. In this
paper, we explore a variety of graph analysis and storage platforms. We compare
their capabil- ities, interfaces, and performance by implementing and computing
a set of real-world graph algorithms on synthetic graphs with up to 256 million
edges. In the spirit of full disclosure, several authors are affiliated with

  Platform: Literature Review",,"Yearb Med Inform. 2012;7(1):83-93",,,"cs.CY cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Objectives: The article provides an overview of current trends in personal
sensor, signal and imaging informatics, that are based on emerging mobile
computing and communications technologies enclosed in a smartphone and enabling
the provision of personal, pervasive health informatics services.
  Methods: The article reviews examples of these trends from the PubMed and
Google scholar literature search engines, which, by no means claim to be
complete, as the field is evolving and some recent advances may not be
documented yet.
  Results: There exist critical technological advances in the surveyed
smartphone technologies, employed in provision and improvement of diagnosis,
acute and chronic treatment and rehabilitation health services, as well as in
education and training of healthcare practitioners. However, the most emerging
trend relates to a routine application of these technologies in a
prevention/wellness sector, helping its users in self-care to stay healthy.
  Conclusions: Smartphone-based personal health informatics services exist, but
still have a long way to go to become an everyday, personalized
healthcare-provisioning tool in the medical field and in a clinical practice.
Key main challenge for their widespread adoption involve lack of user
acceptance striving from variable credibility and reliability of applications
and solutions as they a) lack evidence-based approach; b) have low levels of
medical professional involvement in their design and content; c) are provided
in an unreliable way, influencing negatively its usability; and, in some cases,
d) being industry-driven, hence exposing bias in information provided, for
example towards particular types of treatment or intervention procedures.

random field. This is a long range model where the interactions scale with the
distance with a power law-like form J(r) ~ r^{-\rho} and we can explore mean
field and non-mean field behavior by changing \rho. Thus, it can be used to
approach the phase transitions in finite-dimensional disordered models. We
studied the model at T=0 and we numerically computed its critical exponents in
the non-mean field region for Gaussian disorder. We then computed an analytic
expression for the critical exponent \delta, that holds in the non-mean field
region, and we noted an interesting relation between the critical exponents of
the disordered model and the ones of the pure model, that seems to break down
in the non-mean field region. We finally compare our results for the critical
exponents with the expected ones in D-dimensional short range models and with
the ones of the straightforward one dimensional long range model.

Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) provides a simple and exactly solvable
theoretical framework, predicting various intriguing physical properties.
Evidence of TLL has been observed as power-law behavior in the electronic
transport and momentum-resolved spectroscopy on various types of
one-dimensional (1D) conductors. However, these measurements, which rely on dc
transport involving tunneling processes, cannot identify the eigenmodes of the
TLL, i.e., collective excitations characterized by non-trivial effective charge
e* and charge velocity v*. The elementary process of charge fractionalization,
a phenomenon predicted to occur at the junction of a TLL and non-interacting
leads, has not been observed. Here we report time-resolved transport
measurements on an artificial TLL comprised of coupled integer quantum Hall
edge channels, successfully identifying single charge fractionalization
processes. An electron wave packet with charge e incident from a
non-interacting region breaks up into several fractionalized charge wave
packets at the edges of the artificial TLL region, from which e* and v* can be
directly evaluated. These results are informative for elucidating the nature of
TLLs and low-energy excitations in the edge channels.

intrinsic symmetry over 3D shapes is proposed. To identify prominent symmetric
regions which overlap in space and vary in form, the proposed framework is
decoupled into a Correspondence Space Voting procedure followed by a
Transformation Space Mapping procedure. In the correspondence space voting
procedure, significant symmetries are first detected by identifying surface
point pairs on the input shape that exhibit local similarity in terms of their
intrinsic geometry while simultaneously maintaining an intrinsic distance
structure at a global level. Since different point pairs can share a common
point, the detected symmetric shape regions can potentially overlap. To this
end, a global intrinsic distance-based voting technique is employed to ensure
the inclusion of only those point pairs that exhibit significant symmetry. In
the transformation space mapping procedure, the Functional Map framework is
employed to generate the final map of symmetries between point pairs. The
transformation space mapping procedure ensures the retrieval of the underlying
dense correspondence map throughout the 3D shape that follows a particular
symmetry. Additionally, the formulation of a novel cost matrix enables the
inner product to succesfully indicate the complexity of the underlying symmetry
transformation. The proposed transformation space mapping procedure is shown to
result in the formulation of a semi-metric symmetry space where each point in
the space represents a specific symmetry transformation and the distance
between points represents the complexity between the corresponding
transformations. Experimental results show that the proposed framework can
successfully process complex 3D shapes that possess rich symmetries.

morphology and dynamics of the gas inside the central kpc. The CO map, which
covers the whole nuclear region (nuclear bar and ring), reveals a nuclear
gaseous spiral structure, inside the nuclear ring encircling the nuclear
stellar bar.
  This gaseous spiral is well correlated with the dusty spiral seen in Hubble
Space Telescope images. The nuclear spiral winds up in a pseudo-ring at 200 pc
radius, which might correspond to the inner ILR. Continuum emission is detected
at 0.87 mm only at the very centre, and its origin is more likely thermal dust
emission than non-thermal emission from the AGN. It might correspond to the
molecular torus expected to exist in this Seyfert 2 galaxy. The HCN(4-3) and
HCO+(4-3) lines were observed simultaneously, but only upper limits are
derived, with a ratio to the CO(3-2) line lower than 1/60 at 3sigma, indicating
a relatively low abundance of very dense gas. The kinematics of the gas over

streaming motions due to the spiral; the primary and secondary bars are too

projected velocities. Near the nucleus, there is an intense high-velocity CO
emission feature redshifted to 200 km/s (if located in the plane), with a
blue-shifted counterpart, at 2"" (100 pc) from the centre. While the CO spectra
are quite narrow in the centre, this wide component is interpreted as an
outflow involving a molecular mass of 3.6 10^6 Mo and a flow rate 7 Mo/yr. The
flow could be in part driven by the central star formation, but is mainly
boosted by the AGN through its wind or radio jets.

disjoint loops and/or infinite paths. These loops and paths have been studied
in the physics literature, but little has been proved mathematically.
  We show that each p belongs to either the compact phase (in which the length
of the tricolor loop passing through a fixed edge is a.s. finite, with
exponentially decaying law) or the extended phase (in which the probability
that an n by n by n box intersects a tricolor path of diameter at least n
exceeds a positive constant, independent of n). We show that both phases are
non-empty and the extended phase is a closed subset of the probability simplex.
  We also survey the physics literature and discuss open questions, including
the following: Does p=(1/3,1/3,1/3) belong to the extended phase? Is there a.s.
an infinite tricolor path for this p? Are there infinitely many? Do they scale
to Brownian motion? If p lies on the boundary of the extended phase, do the
long paths have a scaling limit analogous to SLE_6 in two dimensions? What can
be shown for the higher dimensional analogs of this problem?

theories extending the $f(R)$ gravity, towards their use for the inflationary
model building in supergravity, by using both superfields and their field
components. In the curved superspace all those theories are described in terms
of a single chiral scalar curvature superfeld $\mathcal{R}$. Each of those
theories can be dualized into a matter-coupled supergravity without higher
derivatives. The first type is parametrized by a single non-holomorphic
potential $N(\mathcal{R},\bar{\mathcal{R}})$, and gives rise to the dual
matter-coupled supergravities with two dynamical chiral matter superfields
having a no-scale K\""ahler potential. We find that a generic potential
$N(\mathcal{R},\bar{\mathcal{R}})$ generates both the $(R+R^2)$ gravity and the
non-minimal coupling of the propagating complex scalar field to the $R$, needed
for the Starobinsky and Higgs inflation, respectively. We find the general
conditions for the Starobinsky inflation and compute the inflaton mass. The
second type is given by the chiral supergravity actions whose superfield
Lagrangian $F(\mathcal{R},\Sigma({\bar{\mathcal R}}))$ also depends upon the
chiral projection $\Sigma$ of the anti-chiral superfield ${\bar{\mathcal R}}$.
We find that the actions of the second type always give rise to ghosts. We also
revisit the $F(\mathcal{R})$ supergravity actions of the third type (without
the $\Sigma$-dependence) with the reduced number of the extra physical degrees
of freedom, comprising a single chiral matter superfeld with a no-scale
K\""ahler potential. We confirm that the pure $F(\mathcal{R})$ supergravity is
insufficient for realization of the Starobinsky inflation, though by the reason
different from those proposed in the recent literature.

multivariate stochastic models. In statistics, a copula is used as a general
way of formulating a multivariate distribution in such a way that various
general types of dependence can be represented. In case of bivariate sample,
the notion of estimating copula is closely related to that of testing
independence in a bivariate sample, as when the components of the bivariate
sample are independent the copula becomes simply product of two uniform
distributions. So apart from non-parametric estimation of copulas we also
considered it relevant to introduce some non-parametric tests to better
understand the very essence of copula in the explanation of association between
the components. In fact we will develop a general multivariate statistics that
gives rise to a much larger class of non-parametric rank based statistics. This
class of statistics can be used in estimation and testing for the association
present in the bivariate sample. We choose some representative statistics from

real-life behavior of chain-like entities such as solvents and polymers, whose
physical volume prohibits multiple occupation of the same spatial point. In
mathematics, a SAW lives in the n-dimensional lattices.
  In this paper, SAWs are a metaphor for walks across faces of n-dimensional
dice, or more formally, a hyperhedron family H(Theta, b, n). Each face is
assigned a label {x:Theta(x)}; x represents a unique n-dimensional coordinate
string, Theta(x) is the value of the function. The walk searches Theta(x) for
optima by following five simple rules: (1) select a random coordinate and mark
it as the `initial pivot'; (2) probe all unmarked adjacent coordinates, then
select and mark the coordinate with the 'best value' as the new pivot; (3)
continue the walk until either the 'best value' <= `target value' or the walk
is being blocked by adjacent coordinates that are already pivots; (4) if the
walk is blocked, restart the walk from a randomly selected `new initial pivot';
(5) if needed, manage the memory overflow with a streaming-like buffer of
appropriate size.
  Hard instances from a number of problem domains, including the 2D protein
folding problem, with up to (2^{25})*(3^{24}) coordinates, have been solved
with SAWs in less than 1,000,000 steps -- while also exceeding the quality of
best known solutions to date.

leptons and a large imbalance in transverse momentum resulting from
proton-antiproton collisions at 1.96 TeV center-of-mass energy. We use data
corresponding to 5.8 fb-1 of integrated luminosity recorded by the CDF II
detector at the Tevatron collider. Our main objective is to investigate
possible new low-momentum (down to 5 GeV/c) multi-leptonic final states not
investigated by LHC experiments. Relative to previous CDF analyses, we expand
the geometric and kinematic coverage of electrons and muons and utilize tau
leptons that decay hadronically. Inclusion of tau leptons is particularly
important for supersymmetry (SUSY) searches. The results are consistent with
standard-model predictions. By optimizing our event selection to increase
sensitivity to the minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) SUSY model, we set limits on
the associated production of chargino and neutralino, the SUSY partners of the
electroweak gauge bosons. We exclude cross sections up to 0.1 pb and chargino
masses up to 168 GeV/c^2 at 95% CL, for a suited set of mSUGRA parameters. We
also exclude a region of the two-dimensional space of the masses of the
neutralino and the supersymmetric partner of the tau lepton, not previously
excluded at the Tevatron.

special case that graph cuts solve with max flow \cite{KZ:PAMI04} has had
significant impact in computer vision
\cite{BVZ:PAMI01,Kwatra:SIGGRAPH03,Rother:GrabCut04}. In this paper we address
the important class of sum-of-submodular (SoS) functions
\cite{Arora:ECCV12,Kolmogorov:DAM12}, which can be efficiently minimized via a
variant of max flow called submodular flow \cite{Edmonds:ADM77}. SoS functions
can naturally express higher order priors involving, e.g., local image patches;
however, it is difficult to fully exploit their expressive power because they
have so many parameters. Rather than trying to formulate existing higher order
priors as an SoS function, we take a discriminative learning approach,
effectively searching the space of SoS functions for a higher order prior that
performs well on our training set. We adopt a structural SVM approach
\cite{Joachims/etal/09a,Tsochantaridis/etal/04} and formulate the training
problem in terms of quadratic programming; as a result we can efficiently
search the space of SoS priors via an extended cutting-plane algorithm. We also
show how the state-of-the-art max flow method for vision problems
\cite{Goldberg:ESA11} can be modified to efficiently solve the submodular flow
problem. Experimental comparisons are made against the OpenCV implementation of
the GrabCut interactive segmentation technique \cite{Rother:GrabCut04}, which
uses hand-tuned parameters instead of machine learning. On a standard dataset
\cite{Gulshan:CVPR10} our method learns higher order priors with hundreds of
parameter values, and produces significantly better segmentations. While our
focus is on binary labeling problems, we show that our techniques can be
naturally generalized to handle more than two labels.

ring closure probability is much higher than predicted. To explain these
observations, DNA flexibility is investigated with explicit considerations of a
new length scale l_D~10 base pairs, over which DNA local bend angles are
correlated. In this correlated worm-like chain (C-WLC) model, a finite length
correction term is analytically derived and the persistence length is found to
be contour length dependent. While our model reduces to the traditional
worm-like chain model when treating long DNA at length scales much larger than
l_P, it predicts that DNA becomes much more flexible at shorter sizes, which
helps explain recent cyclization measurements of short DNA fragments around 100
base pairs.

well identified. The most popular model is the merger of compact object
binaries (NS-NS/NS-BH). However, other progenitor models cannot be ruled out.
The delay-time distribution of SGRB progenitors, which is an important property
to constrain progenitor models, is still poorly understood. Aims. We aim to
better constrain the luminosity function of SGRBs and the delay-time
distribution of their progenitors with newly discovered SGRBs. Methods. We
present a low-contamination sample of 16 Swift SGRBs that is better defined by
a duration shorter than 0.8 s. By using this robust sample and by combining a
self-consistent star formation model with various models for the distribution
of time delays, the redshift distribution of SGRBs is calculated and then
compared to the observational data. Results. We find that the power-law delay
distribution model is disfavored and that only the lognormal delay distribution
model with the typical delay tau >= 3 Gyr is consistent with the data.
Comparing Swift SGRBs with T90 > 0.8 s to our robust sample (T90 < 0.8 s), we
find a significant difference in the time delays between these two samples.
Conclusions. Our results show that the progenitors of SGRBs are dominated by
relatively long-lived systems (tau >= 3 Gyr), which contrasts the results found
for Type Ia supernovae. We therefore conclude that primordial NS-NS systems are
not favored as the dominant SGRB progenitors. Alternatively, dynamically formed
NS-NS/BH and primordial NS-BH systems with average delays longer than 5 Gyr may
contribute a significant fraction to the overall SGRB progenitors.

concordance group (denoted by $\mathcal{C}$), due to Cochran-Orr-Teichner, has
been instrumental in the study of knot concordance in recent years. Part of its
significance is due to the fact that certain geometric characterizations of a
knot imply membership in various levels of the filtration. We show the
counterpart of this fact for two new filtrations of $\mathcal{C}$ due to
Cochran-Harvey-Horn, the positive and negative filtrations, denoted by
$\{\mathcal{P}_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ and $\{\mathcal{N}_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$

height n+2 in the 4-ball with only positive (resp. negative) kinks in the
base-level kinky disk, then K is in $\mathcal{P}_n$ (resp. $\mathcal{N}_n$). En
route to this result we show that if a knot K bounds a Casson tower of height
n+2 in the 4-ball, it bounds an embedded (symmetric) grope of height n+2, and
is therefore, n-solvable (this also implies that topologically slice knots
bound arbitrarily tall gropes in the 4-ball). We also define a variant of
Casson towers and show that if K bounds a tower of type (2,n) in the 4-ball, it
is n-solvable. If K bounds such a tower with only positive (resp. negative)
kinks in the base-level kinky disk then K is in $\mathcal{P}_n$ (resp.
$\mathcal{N}_n$). Our results show that either every knot which bounds a Casson
tower of height three is topologically slice or there exists a knot which is
not topologically slice but lies in each $\mathcal{F}_n$. We also give a
3-dimensional characterization, up to concordance, of knots which bound kinky

$\alpha$ and distance dependence $r^{-\alpha}$. The ground state (GS) at $g =

GS for any $g$, $\alpha \ge 0$ and decouple at $1/g = 0$ to linear Heisenberg
antiferromagnets on sublattices $A$ and $B$ of odd and even-numbered sites.
Exact diagonalization of finite chains gives the sublattice spin $ \ < S^2_A \

$E_{\sigma}$ to the lowest singlet with opposite inversion symmetry to the GS.
An analytical model that conserves sublattice spin has a first order quantum

phase with $S_A = S_B = 0$ for $g \ge 4/\pi^2$ and no correlation between spins

transition to a decoupled phase that closely resembles the analytical model.
The bond order wave (BOW) phase and continuous quantum phase transitions of
finite models with $\alpha \ge 2$ are discussed in terms of GS degeneracy where
$E_{\sigma}(g) = 0$, excited state degeneracy where $E_{\sigma}(g) = E_m(g)$,
and $\ < S^2_A \ >$. The decoupled phase at large frustration has nondegenerate
GS for any exponent $\alpha$ and excited states related to sublattice

variables (molecular torsions) slaving fast ones the conversion from the
differentiate state to pluripotent state is defined as the quantum transition
between conformational states. The transitional rate is calculated and an
analytical form for the rate formulas is deduced. Then the dependence of the
rate on the number of torsion angles of the gene and the magnitude of the rate
can be estimated by comparison with protein folding. The reaction equations of
the conformational change of the pluripotency genes in chemical reprogramming
are given. The characteristic time of the chemical reprogramming is calculated
and the result is consistent with experiments. The dependence of the transition
rate on physical factors such as temperature, PH value and the volume and shape
of the coherent domain is analyzed from the rate equation. It is suggested that

asymptotic giant branch stars has been simulated numerically. The physical
parameters adopted in the calculations correspond to those of the circumstellar
envelope around IK Tau. The one-dimensional plane-parallel structure of the
gas-dust cloud is considered. The statistical equilibrium equations for the
H$_2$O level populations and the thermal balance equations for the gas-dust
cloud are solved self-consistently. The calculations take into account 410
rotational levels belonging to the five lowest vibrational levels of H$_2$O.
The stellar radiation field is shown to play an important role in the thermal
balance of the gas-dust cloud due to the absorption of emission in
rotational-vibrational H$_2$O lines. The dependence of the gain in the 22.2-GHz
maser line on the gas density and H$_2$O number density in the gas-dust cloud
is investigated. Gas densities close to the mean density of the stellar wind,
10$^7-10^8$ cm$^{-3}$, and a high relative H$_2$O abundance, more than
10$^{-4}$, have been found to be the most likely physical conditions in maser

damage induced in DNA. The formalism is valid for all types of charged
particles and due to its closed nature is suited to provide fast conversion of
dose to DNA-damage. Methods: The induction of double strand breaks in
DNA--strings residing in irradiated cells is quantified using a single particle
model. This leads to a proposal to use the cumulative Cauchy distribution to
express the mix of high and low LET type damage probability generated by a
single particle. A microscopic phenomenological Monte Carlo code is used to fit
the parameters of the model as a function of kinetic energy related to the
damage to a DNA molecule embedded in a cell. The model is applied for four
particles: electrons, protons, alpha--particles, and carbon ions. A geometric
interpretation of this observation using the impact ionization mean free path
as a quantifier, allows extension of the model to very low energies. Results:
The mathematical expression describes the model adequately using a chi--square
test ($\chi^2/NDF < 1$). This applies to all particle types with an almost
perfect fit for protons, while the other particles seem to result in some
discrepancies at very low energies. The implementation calculating a strict
version of the RBE based on complex damage alone is corroborated by
experimental data from the measured RBE. The geometric interpretation generates
a unique dimensionless parameter $k$ for each type of charged particle. In
addition, it predicts a distribution of DNA damage which is different from the

In the data transmission phase, a comb-type OFDM symbol consisting of both
pilots and data symbols is proposed to track phase noise over an OFDM frame.
Next, a novel algorithm that applies the training symbols to jointly estimate
the channel responses, CFO, and phase noise based on the maximum a posteriori
criterion is proposed. Additionally, a new \emph{hybrid Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower

have uncovered that these present a peculiar surface chemical composition. This
is believed to be related to the formation of earth-like planets. This suggests
that twin stars have a radiative interior that is richer in heavy elements than
their envelopes. Moreover, the current standard solar model does not fully
agree with the helioseismology data and solar neutrino flux measurements. In
this work, we find that this agreement can improve if the Sun has mass loss
during the pre-main sequence, as was previously shown by other groups. Despite
this better agreement, the internal composition of the Sun is still uncertain,
especially for elements heavier than helium. With the goal of inferring the
chemical abundance of the solar interior, we tested several chemical
compositions. We found that heavy element abundances influence the sound speed
and solar neutrinos equally. Nevertheless, the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO;13N,
15O and 17F) neutrino fluxes are the most affected; this is due to the fact
that contrarily to proton-proton (pp, pep, 8B and 7Be) neutrino fluxes, the CNO
neutrino fluxes are less dependent on the total luminosity of the star.
Furthermore, if the central solar metallicity increases by 30%, as hinted by
the solar twin stars observations, this new solar model predicts that 13N, 15O
and 17F neutrino fluxes increase by 25%-80% relative to the standard solar
model. Finally, we highlight that the next generation of solar neutrino
experiments will not only put constraints on the abundances of carbon, oxygen
and nitrogen, but will also give some information about their radial
distribution.

proton-proton chain and carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycle that take place at
different radius of the Sun's core. Hence, measurements of solar neutrino
fluxes provide a precise determination of the local temperature. The
accumulation of non-annihilating light dark matter particles (with masses
between 5 GeV and 16 GeV in the Sun produces a change in the local solar
structure, namely, a decrease in the central temperature of a few percent. This
variation depends on the properties of the dark matter particles, such as the
mass of the particle and its spin-independent scattering cross-section on
baryon-nuclei, specifically, the scattering with helium, oxygen, and nitrogen
among other heavy elements. This temperature effect can be measured in almost
all solar neutrino fluxes. In particular, by comparing the neutrino fluxes
generated by stellar models with current observations, namely 8B neutrino

one of the theoretical problems which have attracted a lot of attentions. In
this article we show that such an eV scale light sterile neutrino candidate can

softly-broken Friedberg-Lee (FL) symmetry. In this model a right-handed
neutrino is guaranteed by the FL symmetry to be light comparing with other two
heavy right-handed neutrinos. It can be of eV scale when the FL symmetry is
softly broken and can play the role of eV scale sterile neutrino needed for
explaining the anomalies of experimental data. This model predicts that one of
the active neutrino is massless. We find that this model prefers inverted
hierarchy mass pattern of active neutrinos than normal hierarchy. An
interesting consequence of this model is that realizing relatively large
$|{\tilde U}_{es}|$ and relatively small $|{\tilde U}_{\mu s}|$ in this model
naturally leads to a relatively small $|{\tilde U}_{\tau s}|$. This interesting
prediction can be tested in future atmospheric or solar neutrino experiments.

simplicity, the parallel bit channels that arise in BICM are replaced by
independent binary erasure channels (BECs). For two parallel BECs modeled

the optimization results show that the decoding threshold can be improved over
a uniform random bit mapper, or, alternatively, the spatial chain length of the

coastal morphodynamic changes during storms, saline wedge intrusion along Po

that the motors accumulate at the tips of cellular protrusions, and in addition
form aggregates that are found to drift towards the protrusion base at the rate
of actin treadmilling. We present a one-dimensional driven lattice model, where
motors become inactive after delivering their cargo at the tip, or by loosing
their cargo to a cargo-less neighbor. The results suggest that the experimental
observations may be explained by the formation of traffic jams that form at the

user history is available but there are no ratings - is the most typical
setting in real-world applications, it is much less researched than the
explicit feedback case. State-of-the-art algorithms that are efficient on the
explicit case cannot be automatically transformed to the implicit case if
scalability should be maintained. There are few implicit feedback benchmark
data sets, therefore new ideas are usually experimented on explicit benchmarks.
In this paper, we propose a generic context-aware implicit feedback recommender
algorithm, coined iTALS. iTALS applies a fast, ALS-based tensor factorization
learning method that scales linearly with the number of non-zero elements in
the tensor. We also present two approximate and faster variants of iTALS using
coordinate descent and conjugate gradient methods at learning. The method also
allows us to incorporate various contextual information into the model while
maintaining its computational efficiency. We present two context-aware variants
of iTALS incorporating seasonality and item purchase sequentiality into the
model to distinguish user behavior at different time intervals, and product
types with different repetitiveness. Experiments run on six data sets shows
that iTALS clearly outperforms context-unaware models and context aware
baselines, while it is on par with factorization machines (beats 7 times out of
12 cases) both in terms of recall and MAP.

variation of paths (parametrising flat connections), in degrees at least three.

"1310.0340","Shenwei Huang","Pavol Hell and Shenwei Huang","Complexity of Coloring Graphs without Paths and Cycles",,,,,"cs.DM math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Let $P_t$ and $C_\ell$ denote a path on $t$ vertices and a cycle on $\ell$
vertices, respectively. In this paper we study the $k$-coloring problem for
$(P_t,C_\ell)$-free graphs. Maffray and Morel, and Bruce, Hoang and Sawada,
have proved that 3-colorability of $P_5$-free graphs has a finite forbidden
induced subgraphs characterization, while Hoang, Moore, Recoskie, Sawada, and
Vatshelle have shown that $k$-colorability of $P_5$-free graphs for $k \geq 4$
does not. These authors have also shown, aided by a computer search, that
4-colorability of $(P_5,C_5)$-free graphs does have a finite forbidden induced
subgraph characterization. We prove that for any $k$, the $k$-colorability of
$(P_6,C_4)$-free graphs has a finite forbidden induced subgraph
characterization. We provide the full lists of forbidden induced subgraphs for
$k=3$ and $k=4$. As an application, we obtain certifying polynomial time
algorithms for 3-coloring and 4-coloring $(P_6,C_4)$-free graphs. (Polynomial
time algorithms have been previously obtained by Golovach, Paulusma, and Song,
but those algorithms are not certifying); To complement these results we show
that in most other cases the $k$-coloring problem for $(P_t,C_\ell)$-free
graphs is NP-complete. Specifically, for $\ell=5$ we show that $k$-coloring is
NP-complete for $(P_t,C_5)$-free graphs when $k \ge 4$ and $t \ge 7$; for $\ell
\ge 6$ we show that $k$-coloring is NP-complete for $(P_t,C_\ell)$-free graphs
when $k \ge 5$, $t \ge 6$; and additionally, for $\ell=7$, we show that
$k$-coloring is also NP-complete for $(P_t,C_7)$-free graphs if $k = 4$ and
$t\ge 9$. This is the first systematic study of the complexity of the
$k$-coloring problem for $(P_t,C_\ell)$-free graphs. We almost completely
classify the complexity for the cases when $k \geq 4, \ell \geq 4$, and
identify the last three open cases.

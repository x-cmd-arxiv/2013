and its dependence on different parameters. Simulations were performed using a
""cubed sphere"" code with high grid resolution (244 grid points in the azimuthal
direction), which is twice as high as that used in our earlier studies. We
chose a very low viscosity value, with alpha-parameter alpha=0.02. We observed
from the simulations that the boundary strongly depends on the ratio between
magnetospheric radius r_m (where the magnetic stress in the magnetosphere
matches the matter stress in the disk) and corotation radius r_cor (where the
Keplerian velocity in the disk is equal to the angular velocity of the star).
For a small misalignment angle of the dipole field, Theta=5 degrees, accretion
is unstable if r_cor/r_m>1.35, and is stable otherwise. In cases of a larger
misalignment angle of the dipole, Theta=20 degrees, instability occurs at
slightly larger values, r_cor/r_m>1.41.

become invalid. We derive a master equation for two coupled harmonic
oscillators which are subject to individual heat baths modeled by a collection
of harmonic oscillators, and show that this master equation in general contains
non-local Lindblad terms. We compare the resulting time evolution with that
obtained for dissipation through local Lindblad terms for each individual

particular, the two descriptions give different predictions for the steady
state and for the entanglement between strongly coupled oscillators. This shows
that when describing strongly coupled harmonic oscillators, one must take great

underlying geometrical relations by doing the calculations as much as possible

being free of numerical complications. In the second part, the luminosity

L-T model with $-k = 2E/r^2 =$ constant $> 0$. The value of $k$ and the
function $t_B(r)$ are determined by the $\Lambda$CDM parameters. General
properties of this L-T model are described. Difficulties of carrying the
numerical calculations through the apparent horizon are presented in detail and
mostly solved. The second model is a counterexample to the claim that an L-T

prolong the lifetime of network. Traditional research work focuses on

the consumption power in decoding is significantly larger than transmit power.
This paper investigates the minimization of total power consumption by reducing
the decoding power consumption. For achieving a desired Bit Error Rate (BER),
we introduce some fundamental results on the basis of iterative message-passing
algorithms for Low Density Parity Check Code (LDPC). To reduce energy
dissipation in decoder, LDPC based coded communications between sensors are
considered. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of LDPC at different code
rates and introduce Adaptive Iterative Decoding (AID) by exploiting threshold
on the number of iterations for a certain BER (0.0004). In iterative LDPC
decoding, the total energy consumption of network is reduced by 20 to 25%.

from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 catalog, with
unprecedented statistical significance. To estimate the uncertainties in the
measured genus, we construct 81 mock SDSS LRG surveys along the past light cone
from the Horizon Run 3, one of the largest N-body simulations to date that
evolved 7210^3 particles in a 10815 Mpc/h size box. After carefully modeling
and removing all known systematic effects due to finite pixel size, survey
boundary, radial and angular selection functions, shot noise and galaxy
biasing, we find the observed genus amplitude to reach 272 at 22 Mpc/h
smoothing scale with an uncertainty of 4.2%; the estimated error fully
incorporates cosmic variance. This is the most accurate constraint of the genus
amplitude to date, which significantly improves on our previous results. In
particular, the shape of the genus curve agrees very well with the mean
topology of the SDSS LRG mock surveys in the LCDM universe. However, comparison
with simulations also shows small deviations of the observed genus curve from
the theoretical expectation for Gaussian initial conditions. While these
discrepancies are mainly driven by known systematic effects such as those of
shot noise and redshift-space distortions, they do contain important
cosmological information on the physical effects connected with galaxy
formation, gravitational evolution and primordial non-Gaussianity. We address
here the key role played by systematics on the genus curve, and show how to
accurately correct for their effects to recover the topology of the underlying
matter. In a forthcoming paper, we provide an interpretation of those
deviations in the context of the local model of non-Gaussianity.

transitions or rapid cross-overs in QCD and QCD-like theories in external

fluctuations to Wilson-line potential remains unaltered at one-loop order, the
contribution of fermions effectively becomes two lower dimensional and is
enhanced by the density of states of the lowest Landau level (LLL). In a
spatial compactification and for heavy adjoint fermions, this enhancement leads
to a calculable zero temperature quantum phase transition on R^3*S^1 driven by
a competition between the center-destabilizing gauge contribution and
center-stabilizing LLL fermions. We also show that at a (formal) asymptotically
large magnetic field, the adjoint fermions with arbitrarily large but fixed
mass stabilize the center symmetry. This is an exotic case of simultaneous
non-decoupling of large mass fermions (due to the enhancement by the LLL
density of states) and decoupling from the low energy effective field theory.
This observation has important implications for both Hosotani mechanism, for
which gauge symmetry ""breaking"" occurs, and large-N volume independence
(Eguchi-Kawai reduction), for which gauge structure is never ""broken"". Despite
sounding almost self-contradictory, we carefully explain the physical scales
entering the problem, double-meaning of unbroken center symmetry and how a
clash is avoided. We also identify, for both thermal and spatial
compactification, the jump in magnetic susceptibility as an order parameter for
the deconfinement transition. The predictions of our analysis are testable by

Computations are desired for all com- binations of these variables. If
conducting these computations sequentially is too time- consuming, parallel

sum- mary statistics can be derived and presented in terms of (flat contingency

(JJ) based superconducting quantum bits (qubits). However, the prevailing
technique of thermally oxidizing aluminum via oxygen diffusion produces
problematic defects, such as oxygen vacancies, which are believed to be a
primary source of the two-level fluctuators and contribute to the decoherence
of the qubits. Development of alternative approaches for improved tunneling
barriers becomes urgent and imperative. Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) of
aluminum oxide (Al2O3) is a promising alternative to resolve the issue of
oxygen vacancies in the Al2O3 tunneling barrier, and its self-limiting growth
mechanism provides atomic-scale precision in tunneling barrier thickness
control. A critical issue in ALD of Al2O3 on metals is the lack of hydroxyl
groups on metal surface, which prevents nucleation of the trimethylaluminum
(TMA). In this work, we explore modifications of the aluminum surface with
water pulse exposures followed by TMA pulse exposures to assess the feasibility
of ALD as a viable technique for JJ qubits. ALD Al2O3 films from 40 angstroms
to 100 angstoms were grown on 1.4 angstroms to 500 angstroms of Al and were
characterized with ellipsometry and atomic force microscopy. A growth rate of

Since the IL thickness depends on the availability of Al and saturated at 2 nm,
choosing ultrathin Al wetting layers may lead to ultrathin ALD Al2O3 tunneling

problem, with the focus on algorithms that run in FPT time. In the MaxCover
problem we are given a set N of elements, a family S of subsets of N, and an
integer K. The goal is to find up to K sets from S that jointly cover (i.e.,
include) as many elements as possible. This problem is well-known to be NP-hard
and, under standard complexity-theoretic assumptions, the best possible
polynomial-time approximation algorithm has approximation ratio (1 - 1/e). We
first consider a variant of MaxCover with bounded element frequencies, i.e., a
variant where there is a constant p such that each element belongs to at most p
sets in S. For this case we show that there is an FPT approximation scheme
(i.e., for each B there is a B-approximation algorithm running in FPT time) for
the problem of maximizing the number of covered elements, and a randomized FPT
approximation scheme for the problem of minimizing the number of elements left
uncovered (we take K to be the parameter). Then, for the case where there is a
constant p such that each element belongs to at least p sets from S, we show
that the standard greedy approximation algorithm achieves approximation ratio
exactly (1-e^{-max(pK/|S|, 1)}). We conclude by considering an unrestricted
variant of MaxCover, and show approximation algorithms that run in exponential
time and combine an exact algorithm with a greedy approximation. Some of our
results improve currently known results for MaxVertexCover.

finding localised systems in quantum field theory that are useful for quantum
information. It draws from many well established physical theories such as
quantum field theory in curved spacetimes, quantum optics and Gaussian state
quantum information. The results are split between three chapters. For the
first results, we set-up the basic framework for working with quantum fields
confined to cavities. By considering the real Klein-Gordon field, we describe
how to model the non-uniform motion of a rigid cavity through spacetime. We
employ the use of Bogoliubov transformations to describe the effects of
changing acceleration. The second set of results investigate how the Dirac
field can be confined to a cavity for quantum information purposes. By again
considering Bogoliubov transformations, we thoroughly investigate how the
entanglement shared between two cavities is affected by non-uniform motion. It
is shown that different types of Dirac field states are more robust against
motion than others. The final results look at using our second notion of
localisation, Unruh- DeWitt detectors. We investigate how allowing for a
""non-point-like"" spatial profile of the Unruh-DeWitt detector affects how it
interacts with a quantum field around it. By engineering suitable
detector-field interactions, we use techniques from symplectic geometry to
compute the dynamics of a quantum state beyond commonly used perturbation
theory. There is also a conclusions chapter at the end of the thesis which
summarises the results presented and suggestions of possible new directions of
research in relativistic quantum information are made.

estimated the star's bolometric flux and used it, in combination with its
parallax and angular diameter, to determine the star's luminosity and effective
temperature. For two data sets of bolometric flux we derived an effective
temperature of 7800+/-170 K and a luminosity of 18+/-1 L_sun or of 8000+/-210 K
and 19+/-2 L_sun. We used these fundamental parameters together with the large
frequency separation to constrain the mass and the age of 10 Aql, using the

ignoring all kinds of diffusion and settling of elements, we obtained a mass of

determine an accurate angular diameter for a star smaller than 0.3 mas and to
derive its fundamental parameters. In particular, by only combining our
interferometric data and the bolometric flux, we derived an effective
temperature that can be compared to those derived from atmosphere models. Such

progressive motion of kicked discrete solitons is predicted, by comparing the

terms, we identify parameter regions where odd and even fundamental modes
exchange their stability, involving intermediate asymmetric modes. In this

the main material properties of calcium silicate, its E-value, was assigned
randomly to the finite elements of the modeled specimen. Calcium silicate is a
frequently used building material with a relatively brittle fracture
characteristic. Its initial E-value varies, as well as tensile strength and
post peak behavior. Therefore, in the simulation, initial E-values were
randomly assigned to the elements of the model and a step function used for
describing the descending branch. The method also allows for variation in

device engineering, such as is needed in the fields of quantum information
processing, high-resolution spectroscopy and quantum metrology. When scaling up
the quantum registers in such devices, several challenges arise: individual
addressing of qubits in a dense spectrum while suppressing crosstalk, creation
of entanglement between distant nodes, and decoupling from unwanted
interactions. The experimental implementation of optimal control is a
prerequisite to meeting these challenges. Using engineered microwave pulses, we
experimentally demonstrate optimal control of a prototype solid state spin
qubit system comprising thirty six energy levels. The spin qubits are
associated with proximal nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. We
demonstrate precise single-electron spin qubit operations with an unprecedented
fidelity F \approx 0.99 in combination with high-efficiency storage of electron
spin states in a nuclear spin quantum memory. Matching single-electron spin
operations with spin-echo techniques, we further realize high-quality entangled
states (F > 0.82) between two electron spins on demand. After exploiting
optimal control, the fidelity is mostly limited by the coherence time and
imperfect initialization. Errors from crosstalk in a crowded spectrum of 8
lines as well as detrimental effects from active dipolar couplings have been
simultaneously eliminated to unprecedented extent. Finally, by entanglement
swapping to nuclear spins, nuclear spin entanglement over a length scale of 25
nm is demonstrated. This experiment underlines the importance of optimal
control for scalable room temperature spin-based quantum information devices.

ratios and good visible-light adaptive optics performance will be achieved by
such an upgraded system on stars as faint as mV = 16-17 using an optimized
low-order NGS sensor. This will enable direct imaging searches for, and
subsequent characterization of, companions around cool, low-mass stars for the
first time, as well as routine visible-light imaging twice as sharp as HST for
fainter targets. PULSE will reuse the laser and wavefront sensor technologies
developed for the automated Robo-AO laser system currently operating at the
Palomar 60-inch telescope, as well as take advantage of pending optimization of
low-order NGS wavefront sensing and planned new interfaces to the PALM-3000

optics sharpened faint natural source will be measured by the current PALM-3000

closed-loop to the 241 active element low-order deformable mirror. The natural

(pseudo)scalar charge g_S(P) of the nucleon can be related to the difference
(sum) of the nucleon masses in the absence of electromagnetic effects. Using
recent determinations of these quantities from phenomenological and lattice QCD
studies we obtain the accurate values g_S=1.02(11) and g_P=349(9) in the MS-bar

interactions in nuclear beta decays are studied, finding epsilon_S=0.0012(24)
at 90%CL, which is significantly more stringent than current LHC bounds and
previous low-energy bounds using less precise g_S values. We argue that our
results could be rapidly improved with updated computations and the direct
calculation of certain ratios in lattice QCD. Finally we discuss the pion-pole
enhancement of g_P, which makes beta decays much more sensitive to non-standard

inflaton field behaves coherently and follows a classical path. It is pointed
out that a background inflaton field \phi_0 falling down a potential density
V(\phi) can and frequently should undergo a quantum tunneling effect involving
an energy \DeltaV<<V, so that it becomes possible to create perturbative
inflatons \phi's, which, in turn, can disintegrate into other particles. We
argue for this scenario using large field inflation assumed during a typical
slow-roll regime, and typical values for the physical quantities associated
with the tunneling effect are worked out. It is shown how, as a result of these
highly energetic and localized processes, the components of the metric receive
strong gradients within a small volume. These pockets of gravity can gravitate
both attractively or repulsively, since the Ricci tensor contains squared
partial derivative terms with either positive or negative sign, so they can be
a component of either dark matter or dark energy. As the Universe expands the
curvature of the pockets weakens as 1/a^2, where a(t) is the scale factor of
the expansion, but it is shown that, as long as the integral over the
gravitating gravitational fields of the pocket is done over all of the
expanding volume of the pocket, the value of the integral is not affected by
the expansion. Geometrically speaking, the gravitation of a pocket is produced
by the convolutions of the metric inside it; as the Universe expands the
convolutions are over a much large volume so they are flatter, but an
integration over the larger volume gives the same result as before the
expansion. It is just a change of scale of the same geometry. A common cause
(inflaton quantum tunneling) for both dark matter and dark energy explains why
their quantities are of the same order of magnitude.

statement for disk invariants, which we extend to arbitrary topologies in the
Hard Lefschetz case. Motivated by ideas of Iritani, Coates-Corti-Iritani-Tseng

K-groups, and 2) an all-genus version of the OCRC for Hard Lefschetz targets.
We provide a complete proof of both statements in the case of minimal
resolutions of threefold An singularities; as a necessary step of the proof we
establish the all-genus closed Crepant Resolution Conjecture with descendents

oscillations (QPOs). After carefully modeling the noise continuum, we find that
the ~3.8 hr QPO in the ultrasoft active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidate 2XMM
J123103.2+110648 was significantly detected (~5sigma) in two XMM-Newton
observations in 2005, but not in the one in 2003. The QPO rms is very high and
increases from ~25% in 0.2-0.5 keV to ~50% in 1-2 keV. The QPO probably
corresponds to the low-frequency type in Galactic black hole X-ray binaries,
considering its large rms and the probably low mass (~10^5 msun) of the black
hole in the nucleus. We also fit the soft X-ray spectra from the three
XMM-Newton observations and find that they can be described with either pure
thermal disk emission or optically thick low-temperature Comptonization. We see
no clear X-ray emission from the two Swift observations in 2013, indicating
lower source fluxes than those in XMM-Newton observations.

gauge symmetry, which enables gravitational interaction to be unified with the
strong and the electroweak interactions. Such a total-unified model is based on
a generalized Yang-Mills framework in flat space-time. Following the idea of
Glashow-Salam-Ward-Weinberg, we gauge the groups $T_4 \times (SU_3)_{color}
\times SU_2 \times U_1\times U_{1b}$ on equal-footing, so that we have the
total-unified gauge covariant derivative ${\bf \d}_{\mu} = \p_{\mu} -
ig\phi_{\mu}^{\nu} p_{\nu}+ig_{s}{G_{\mu}^{a}}(\ld^a/2) +if{W_{\mu}^{k}}{t^k} +
if' U_{\mu}t_{o} + ig_{b}B_{\mu}$. The generators of the external $T_4$ group
have the representation $p_{\mu}=i\p_{\mu}$, which differs from other
generators of all internal groups, which have constant matrix representations.
Consequently, the total-unified model leads to the following new results: (a)
All internal $(SU_3)_{color}, SU_2, U_1$ and baryonic $U_{1b}$ gauge symmetries
have extremely small violations due to the gravitational interaction. (b) The
$T_4$ gauge symmetry remains exact and dictates the universal coupling of
gravitons. (c) Such a gravitational violation of internal gauge symmetries
leads to modified eikonal and Hamilton-Jacobi type equations, which are
obtained in the geometric-optics limit and involve effective Riemann metric
tensors. (d) The rules for Feynman diagrams involving new couplings of
photon-graviton, gluon-graviton and quark-gaviton are obtained.

to static spin polarizations at the ribbon edges, which are well described by

the application of graphene in spintronics. On the quantum side, however, the

trends with veiling and accretion. The observed line ratios are compared to two
theoretical models for line formation: (1) Baker and Menzel's (1938) Case B for
radiative ionization and recombination and (2) a set of local line excitation
calculations designed to replicate the conditions in T Tauri winds and magnetic
accretion columns (Kwan & Fischer 2011). While the comparison between Case B
and observed line ratios implies a wide range in electron density and
temperature among the hydrogen line formation regions in T Tauri stars, the
predictions of the local line excitation models give consistent results across
multiple diagnostics. Under the assumptions of the local line excitation
calculations, we find that n_H in the hydrogen line formation region is
constrained to 2x10^10 -- 2x10^11 cm^-3, where stars with higher accretion
rates have densities at the higher end of this range. Because of uncertainties
in extinction, temperature is not well delineated but falls within the range
expected for collisional excitation to produce the line photons. We introduce
new diagnostics for assessing extinction based on near infrared hydrogen line

in different models for how the cosmic baryons are distributed (both
analytically and with cosmological simulations). We show that the distribution
of DM is quite sensitive to whether the ""missing"" baryons lie around the virial

constrained with other observational techniques. The intrinsic contribution to
DM from each source could complicate studies of the extragalactic contribution.
This difficulty is avoided by stacking based on the impact parameter to
foreground galaxies. We show that a stacking analysis using a sample of ~100 DM

constraints at 0.2-2 halo virial radii on the baryonic mass profile surrounding
different galaxy types. Conveniently for intergalactic studies, sightlines that

scattering. A detectable level of scattering may also result from turbulence in

ABJM solution, while for m_q very small our solution becomes asymptotically
equivalent to the one found recently for massless smeared flavors. We study the

statistical uncertainties, our MZ relation agrees with the z~2.3 result,

qualitatively consistent with the lower mean redshift z=1.76 of our sample. For
the masses probed by our data, the MZ relation shows a steep slope which is
suggestive of feedback from energy-driven winds, and a cosmological downsizing
evolution where high mass galaxies reach the local MZ relation at earlier
times. In addition, we show that our sample falls on an extrapolation of the

luminous galaxies (log(LIR)>11.6Lsun) in the local Universe (z<0.25). Recent
studies based on the relation between galaxies' star formation rates and
stellar mass (the SFR-M relation or the galaxy main sequence (MS)) have
suggested that galaxy interaction/mergers may only become significant when
galaxies fall well above the galaxy MS. Since the typical SFR at given M
increases with redshift, the existence of galaxy MS implies that massive,
IR-luminous galaxies at high-z may not necessarily be driven by galaxy
interactions. We examine the role of galaxy interactions in the SFR-M relation
by carrying out a morphological analysis of 2084 Herschel-selected galaxies at
0.2 < z < 1.5 in the COSMOS field. Herschel-PACS and -SPIRE observations
covering the full 2-deg^2 COSMOS field provide one of the largest far-IR
selected samples of high-redshift galaxies with well-determined redshifts to
date, with sufficient sensitivity at z ~ 1, to sample objects lying on and
above the galaxy MS. Using a detailed visual classification scheme, we show
that the fraction of ""disk galaxies"" decreases and the fraction of ""irregular""
galaxies increases systematically with increasing LIR out to z ~ 1.5 and z ~
1.0, respectively. At log(LIR) > 11.5 Lsun, >50% of the objects show evident
features of strongly interacting/merger systems, where this percentage is
similar to the studies of local IR-luminous galaxies. The fraction of
interacting/merger systems also systematically increases with the deviation
from the SFR-M relation, supporting the view that galaxies fall above the MS
are more dominated by mergers than the MS galaxies. Meanwhile, we find that
~18% of massive IR-luminous MS galaxies are classified as interacting systems,
where this population may not evolve through the evolutionary track predicted

constraints obtained from the MFs are approximately 1.5-2 times better than the
ones obtained from the first few moments of the convergence distribution ---
provided that the latter include spatial information, either from moments of
gradients, or by combining multiple smoothing scales. Including either a set of
these moments or the MFs can significantly tighten constraints on cosmological
parameters, compared to the conventional method of using the power spectrum
alone.

infinite number of consistency relations, which relate N+1-point correlation
functions with a soft-momentum scalar or tensor mode to a symmetry
transformation on N-point correlation functions of hard-momentum modes. They
constrain, at each order n, the q^n behavior of the soft limits. In this paper
we show that all consistency relations derive from a single, master identity,
which follows from the Slavnov-Taylor identity for spatial diffeomorphisms.
This master identity is valid at any value of q and therefore goes beyond the
soft limit. By differentiating it n times with respect to the soft momentum, we
recover the consistency relations at each q order. Our approach underscores the
role of spatial diffeomorphism invariance at the root of cosmological
consistency relations. It also offers new insights on the necessary conditions
for their validity: a physical contribution to the vertex functional must
satisfy certain analyticity properties in the soft limit in order for the
consistency relations to hold. For standard inflationary models, this is
equivalent to requiring that mode functions have constant growing-mode
solutions. For more exotic models in which modes do not ""freeze"" in the usual
sense, the analyticity requirement offers an unambiguous criterion.

(ULXs) still remains poorly understood. Most of the scenarios proposed to
explain their nature assume that ULXs are powered by accretion on to a black
hole (BH). In this case, the detection of compact radio emission and the
location of the ULXs in the Fundamental Plane (X-ray versus radio-luminosity
plane) can provide an estimate of the ULX BH mass and help address the question
of their physical nature. We present the results of a high-resolution (very
long baseline interferometry) radio observational campaign aimed at detecting
and studying compact radio emission in four ULXs with known radio counterparts.
We find that one of the targets (N4559-X4) was previously misclassified: its
low X-ray luminosity indicates that the source is not a ULX. No
milliarcsec-scale radio emission is detected for N4559-X4 nor for the ULXs
N4490-X1 and N5194-X2, for which upper limits on the radio luminosities are
estimated. These limits argue strongly against the presence of supermassive BHs
in these three systems. For N4559-X4, the low X-ray luminosity and the ratio of
the radio and X-ray luminosities suggest the presence of an X-ray binary.
Compact radio emission is detected for the ULX N5457-X9 within its
\textit{Chandra} positional error, making N5457-X9 a potential
intermediate-mass BH with steady jet emission.

based on a large z~2 non-broad absorption lines quasar sample built from the
Wide-field Infrared Survey and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data releases. We
use the near infrared slope and the infrared to UV luminosity ratio to indicate
the hot dust emission relative to the emission from the accretion disk. In our
luminous quasars, these hot dust emission indicators are almost independent of
the fundamental parameters, such as luminosity, Eddington ratio and black hole
mass, but moderately dependent on the blueshift and asymmetry index (BAI) and
full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of CIV lines. Interestingly, the latter two
correlations dramatically strengthen with increasing Eddington ratio. We
suggest that, in high Eddington ratio quasars, CIV regions are dominated by
outflows so the BAI and FWHM(CIV) can reliably reflect the general properties
and velocity of outflows, respectively. While in low Eddington ratio quasars,
CIV lines are primarily emitted by virialized gas so the BAI and FWHM(CIV)
become less sensitive to outflows. Therefore, the correlations for the highest
Eddington ratio quasars are more likely to represent the true dependence of hot
dust emission on outflows and the correlations for the entire sample are
significantly diluted by the low Eddington ratio quasars. Our results show that
an outflow with a large BAI or velocity can double the hot dust emission on
average. We suggest that outflows either contain hot dust in themselves or
interact with the dusty interstellar medium or torus.

that A. aeolicus uses the reconstructed ancestral pathways within many of these

three general classes of driving forces in metabolic evolution. One is the
duplication and divergence of genes for enzymes as these progress from lower to
higher substrate specificity, improving the kinetics of certain sub-systems. A
second is the kinetic optimization of established pathways through fusion of

effectively separates cluster and field populations. The overall spatial

identified by the Bayesian technique as field stars. These stars are
preferentially concentrated at faint magnitudes. Equally importantly the

our method, we place it in the context of other procedures for matching

out with, for example, a 10-ton Xe detector, although distinguishing the

because it was unpredicted. In addition, the time evolution of the nuclear

of 17P/Holmes before and after the 2007 outburst through optical and
mid-infrared observations. We found that the nucleus highly depleted its
near-surface icy component before but became activated after the 2007 outburst.
Assuming a conventional 1-um-sized grain model, we derived a surface fractional
active area of 0.58% +- 0.14% before the outburst whereas it was enlarged by a
factor of ~50 after the 2007 outburst. We also found that large (>=1 mm)
particles could be dominant in the dust tail observed around aphelion. Based on
the size of the particles, the dust production rate was >=170 kg/s at the
heliocentric distance rh = 4.1 AU, suggesting that the nucleus still held
active status around the aphelion passage. The nucleus color was similar to
that of the dust particles and average for a Jupiter-family comet but different
from most Kuiper Belt objects, implying that the color may be inherent to icy
bodies in the solar system. On the basis of these results, we concluded that

parameter choice with regularized linear least squares, are successfully
adapted to be used for the non-negatively constrained Tikhonov least squares
problem. Although these results have been verified within the context of the
analysis of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, there is no reason to
suppose that they would not be relevant within the broader framework of solving
Fredholm integral equations for other applications.

the world. It demonstrates the cerebral approach combining the several
technology to handle the problem of learning. MCL motivates the social and
educational activities for creating healthier environment. To advance and
promote the baseline of MCL, different frameworks have been introduced for MCL.
From other side, there is no highly acceptable security mechanism has been
implemented to protect MCL environment. This paper introduces the issue of
rogue DHCP server, which highly affects the performance of users who
communicate with each other through MCL. The rogue DHCP is unofficial server
that gives incorrect IP address to user in order to use the legal sources of
different servers by sniffing the traffic. The contribution focuses to maintain
the privacy of users and enhances the confidentiality. The paper introduces
multi-frame signature-cum anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (MSAIDS)
supported with innovative algorithms, modification in the existing rules of IDS
and use of mathematical model. The major objectives of research are to identify
the malicious attacks created by rogue DHCP server. This innovative mechanism
emphasizes the security for users in order to communicate freely. It also
protects network from illegitimate involvement of intruders. Finally, the paper
validates the mechanism using three types of simulations: testbed, discrete
simulation in C++ and ns2. On the basis of findings, the efficiency of proposed
mechanism has been compared with other well-known techniques.

coupled to a 2D Poisson equation, solved in the cross section of the NW. Upon
convergence, the linearized Boltzmann transport theory is employed for the
mobility calculation, including carrier scattering by phonons and surface
roughness. As the channel is driven into inversion, for [111] and [110] NW
devices of diameters D>10nm the curvature of the bandstructure increases and
the hole effective mass becomes lighter, resulting in a approx. 50% mobility
increase. Such improvement is large enough to compensate for the detrimental
effect of surface roughness scattering. The effect is very similar to the
bandstructure variations and mobility improvement observed under geometric
confinement, however, in this case confinement is caused by electrostatic
gating. We provide explanations for this behavior based on features of the
heavy-hole band. This effect could be exploited in the design of p-type NW
devices. We note, finally, that the 'apparent' mobility of low dimensional
short channel transistors is always lower than the intrinsic channel diffusive
mobility due to the detrimental influence of the so called 'ballistic'

Wang proved that every directed graph $\overrightarrow G$ on $3k$ vertices with

Minkowski space with a planar boundary or with a planar defect of any

the reduced density matrix and associated EE obtained by tracing over the
degrees of freedom outside of a (hemi-)sphere centered on the boundary or
defect. Following Casini, Huerta, and Myers, we map the reduced density matrix
to a thermal density matrix of the same theory on hyperbolic space. The EE maps
to the thermal entropy of the theory on hyperbolic space. For BCFTs and DCFTs
dual holographically to Einstein gravity theories, the thermal entropy is
equivalent to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a hyperbolic black brane. We
show that the horizon of the hyperbolic black brane coincides with the minimal
area surface used in Ryu and Takayanagi's conjecture for the holographic
calculation of EE. We thus prove their conjecture in these cases. We use our
results to compute the R\'enyi entropies and EE in DCFTs in which the defect
corresponds to a probe brane in a holographic dual.

temperatures from 296\,K down to 6\,K with a terahertz time-domain spectrometer
(0.2\,-\,2.5\,THz). The continuous spectra contributed from charge carriers are
dispersive in this frequency range and also temperature- and carrier
type-dependent. The Drude-Smith model taking multiple-scatterings of charge
carriers into account well reproduces those data. The relaxation rate of the
$n$-type carriers decreases more sharply than that in the $p$-type material,
suggesting that a stronger electron-phonon interaction may exist in the
$n$-type than in the $p$-type. On the other hand, the localized infrared-active
modes observed at 1.3\,THz and 1.7\,THz, identified as the rattling phonons of
the Ba$^{2+}$ ion's quasi-on-center vibrations, become soft and broad
significantly with decreasing temperature as well as observed in type-I BGS and
BGG (Ba$_8$Ga$_{16}$Ge$_{30}$) clathrates. The softening in the $n$-type is
smaller by about 30% than in the $p$-type, whereas the linewidth brodening is
almost the same independently on the carrier type. The difference in the
softening is discussed with a scenario where the interaction of rattling
phonons with carriers can modify the anharmonic potential of the guest ions.
The anomalous broadening at low temepratures is also discussed by the
impurity-scattering model presented for a rattling-phonon system strongly
hybridized with acoustic cage phonons.

results in the numerical simulations of high-velocity impact problems. To this
end, we consider the problem of a rigid projectile moving at a range of

result shows that the addition of a characteristic length scale to the

excellent agreements between numerical and experimental results. Furthermore,
the application of a nonlocal model for higher strain rate behavior shows the

matroids which are a very generic algebraic structure permitting to define a

that, in high enough dimension, the basic ingredients of orthomatroids (more
precisely the simple and irreducible ones) are isomorphic to generalized

function of discriminating and encoding incident light signals according to

produced by point-like discrete quantum geometry excitations (or {\em
punctures}) labelled by spin $j$. The excitations possibly carry other internal
degrees of freedom also, and the associated quantum states are eigenstates of
the area $A$ operator. On the other hand, the appropriately scaled area
operator $A/(8\pi\ell)$ is also the physical Hamiltonian associated with the
quasilocal stationary observers located at a small distance $\ell$ from the
horizon. Thus, the local energy is entirely accounted for by the geometric
operator $A$.
  We assume that: In a suitable vacuum state with regular energy momentum
tensor at and close to the horizon the local temperature measured by stationary
observers is the Unruh temperature and the degeneracy of `matter' states is
exponential with the area $\exp{(\lambda A/\ell_p^2)}$---this is supported by
the well established results of QFT in curved spacetimes, which do not
determine $\lambda$ but asserts an exponential behaviour. The geometric
excitations of the horizon (punctures) are indistinguishable. In the
semiclassical limit the area of the black hole horizon is large in Planck
units.
  It follows that: Up to quantum corrections, matter degrees of freedom
saturate the holographic bound, {\em viz.} $\lambda=\frac{1}{4}$. Up to quantum
corrections, the statistical black hole entropy coincides with
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy $S={A}/({4\ell_p^2})$. The number of horizon
punctures goes like $N\propto \sqrt{A/\ell_p^2}$, i.e the number of punctures
$N$ remains large in the semiclassical limit. Fluctuations of the horizon area
are small while fluctuations of the area of an individual puncture are large. A
precise notion of local conformal invariance of the thermal state is recovered
in the $A\to\infty$ limit where the near horizon geometry becomes Rindler.

deep color-magnitude diagrams have been obtained is indeed along the minor

populations far away from the bulge minor axis. Color-magnitude diagrams and
luminosity functions have been obtained from deep near-IR VLT/HAWK-I images
taken at the two Southern corners of the boxy bulge, i.e., near the opposite
edges of the Galactic bar. The foreground disk contamination has been
statistically removed using a pure disk field observed with the same instrument
and located approximately at similar Galactic latitudes of the two bulge
fields, and 30deg in longitude away from the Galactic center. For each bulge
field, mean reddening and distance are determined using the position of red
clump stars, and the metallicity distribution is derived photometrically using
the color distribution of stars in the upper red giant branch. The resulting
metallicity distribution function of both fields peaks around [Fe/H] -0.1 dex,
with the bulk of the stellar population having a metallicity within the range:
-1 dex < [Fe/H] <+0.4 dex, quite similar to that of other inner bulge fields.
Like for the inner fields previously explored, the color-magnitude diagrams of
the two bar fields are consistent with their stellar population being older
than ~10 Gyr, with no obvious evidence for the presence of a younger

researchers often use simple models to capture the spreading dynamics. But most
models only highlight the effect of local interactions on the global spreading
of a single information wave, and ignore the effects of interactions between
multiple waves. Here we take into account the effect of multiple interacting
waves by using an agent-based model in which the interaction between
information waves is based on their novelty. We analyzed the global effects of
such interactions and found that information that actually reaches nodes
reaches them faster. This effect is caused by selection between information
waves: slow waves die out and only fast waves survive. As a result, and in
contrast to models with non-interacting information dynamics, the access to
information decays with the distance from the source. Moreover, when we
analyzed the model on various synthetic and real spatial road networks, we
found that the decay rate also depends on the path redundancy and the effective
dimension of the system. In general, the decay of the information wave
frequency as a function of distance from the source follows a power law
distribution with an exponent between -0.2 for a two-dimensional system with
high path redundancy and -0.5 for a tree-like system with no path redundancy.
We found that the real spatial networks provide an infrastructure for
information spreading that lies in between these two extremes. Finally, to
better understand the mechanics behind the scaling results, we provide analytic
calculations of the scaling for a one-dimensional system.

with $(001)$ and $(110)$ facets only: a truncated pyramid and a truncated
bipyramid containg 620 and 1096 atoms, respectively. It is shown that the MAE
of slabs originates mainly from outer layers, a small contribution from the
bulk gives rise, however, to an oscillatory behavior for large thicknesses.
Interestingly, the MAE of the nanoclusters considered is almost solely due to
$(001)$ facets and the base perimeter of the pyramid. We believe that this fact

well-defined non-negative self-adjoint two-scale limit operator. A key novel
technical ingredient here is a proof that the linear span of product test
functions in the functional spaces corresponding to the degeneracies is dense
in associated two-scale energy space for a general coupling between the scales.

convergence, as well as some of its further implications for the spectral

hydrophobicity scales as a proxy for amino acid character, and the Mean Square
measure as a function quantifying error robustness, a value can be obtained for
a genetic code which reflects the error robustness of that code. By comparing
this value with a distribution of values belonging to codes generated by random
permutations of amino acid assignments, the level of error robustness of a
genetic code can be quantified. We present a calculation in which the standard
genetic code is shown to be optimal. We obtain this result by (1) using
recently updated values of polar requirement as input; (2) fixing seven
assignments (Ile, Trp, His, Phe, Tyr, Arg, and Leu) based on aptamer
considerations; and (3) using known biosynthetic relations of the 20 amino
acids. This last point is reflected in an approach of subdivision (restricting
the random reallocation of assignments to amino acid subgroups, the set of 20
being divided in four such subgroups). The three approaches to explain
robustness of the code (specific selection for robustness, amino acid-RNA
interactions leading to assignments, or a slow growth process of assignment
patterns) are reexamined in light of our findings. We offer a comprehensive
hypothesis, stressing the importance of biosynthetic relations, with the code
evolving from an early stage with just glycine and alanine, via intermediate
stages, towards 64 codons carrying todays meaning.

dynamically equivalent. In the case of travelling waves, this trivial degree of
freedom can be removed by going to a frame of reference that moves with the
state, thereby turning the travelling wave in the laboratory frame to a fixed
point in the comoving frame of reference. We here discuss a general method by
which the translational displacements can be removed also for more complicated
and dynamically active states and demonstrate its application for several
examples. For flows states in the asymptotic suction boundary layer we show
that in the case of the long-period oscillatory edge state we can find local
phase speeds which remove the fast oscillations and reveal the slow vortex
dynamics underlying the burst phenomenon. For spanwise translating states we
show that the method removes the drift but not the dynamical events that cause
the big spanwise displacement. For a turbulent case we apply the method to the
spanwise shifts and find slow components that are correlated over very long

in the transverse motions are not special to the asymptotic suction boundary

University of Cambridge's Centre for Entrepreneurial Learning ETECH Project
programme, designed to accelerate entrepreneurship and diffusion of innovations
based on early stage and potentially disruptive technologies from the
University. The axial flux machine design is assumed to utilise high
temperature superconductors in both wire (stator winding) and bulk (rotor
field) forms, to operate over a temperature range of 65-77 K, and to have a
power output in the range from 10s of kW up to 1 MW (typical for axial flux
machines), with approximately 2-3 T as the peak trapped field in the bulk
superconductors. The authors firstly investigate the applicability of this type
of machine as a generator in small- and medium-sized wind turbines, including
the current and forecasted market and pricing for conventional turbines. A
study is also carried out on the machine's applicability as an in-wheel hub
motor for electric vehicles. Some recommendations for future applications are
made based on the outcome of these two studies. Next, the cost of YBCO-based
superconducting (2G HTS) wire is analysed with respect to competing wire
technologies and compared with current conventional material costs. Current
wire costs for both 1G and 2G HTS are still too great to be economically
feasible for such superconducting devices, but round wire, so-called 3G HTS,
conductors may be a promising new option with a view to the future. Finally,
different cooling options are assessed for the machine design and the analysis
suggests that waiting for the maturation of pulse-tube cooling technology may
be the best option for this particular application.

$d_{x^2-y^2}$-paired superconducting phase, which has been recently found in
the weak-coupling approach as a basic mechanism due to the Pauli paramagnetic
pair-breaking (PPB) in relation to the high-field behaviors in CeCoIn_5, is
studied in the strong-coupling approach taking account of the electron
correlation. Applying the fluctuation-exchange (FLEX) approximation to the
two-dimensional Hubbard model including the Zeeman term, it is shown that the
PPB-induced AFM ordering in the superconducting (SC) phase and the first order
SC transition on H_{c2}(T) are realized in the strong-coupling approach as well
as those in the weak-coupling model, and that the AFM ordering is affected by
the quasiparticle renormalization and the amplitude of the SC order parameter.
This AFM ordering may appear in a wide range of materials close to an AFM
quantum critical point (QCP).

in scattering between two different atoms and hybridizes field-free rotational
states of heteronuclear dimers or polar molecules. In a previous paper [D.
Chakraborty $\it {et.}$ $\it {al.}$, J. Phys. B 44, 095201 (2011)], the effects
of a static electric field on one-color photoassociation between different
atoms has been described through field-modified ground-state scattering states,
neglecting electric field effects on heteronuclear diatomic bound states. To
study the effects of a static electric field on heteronuclear bound states, and
the resulting influence on Raman-type two-color photoassociation between
different atoms in the presence of a static electric field, we develop a
non-perturbative numerical method to calculate static electric field-dressed
heteronuclear bound states. We show that the static electric field induced
scattering anisotropy as well as hybridization of rotational states strongly
influence two-color photoassociation spectra, leading to significant
enhancement in PA rate and large shift. In particular, for static electric
field strengths of a few hundred kV/cm, two-color PA rate involving high-lying
bound states in electronic ground-state increases by several orders of
magnitude even in the weak photoassociative coupling regime.

resolves singularities in codimension one. Existing algorithmic methods for

given ring in form an endomorphism ring of a certain (fractional) ideal until
the process becomes stationary. While Vasconcelos' method uses the dual
Jacobian ideal, Grauert-Remmert-type algorithms rely on so-called test ideals.
  For algebraic varieties, one can apply such normalization algorithms
globally, locally, or formal analytically at all points of the variety. In this
paper, we relate the number of iterations for global Grauert-Remmert-type
normalization algorithms to that of its local descendants.
  We complement our results by an explicit study of ADE singularities. This
includes the description of the normalization process in terms of value
semigroups of curves. It turns out that the intermediate steps produce only ADE
singularities and simple space curve singularities from the list of

power constraint and with perfect channel state information available at the
receiver. Infinite constellations are the framework, proposed by Poltyrev, for
analyzing coded modulation codes. The Poltyrev's capacity, is the highest
achievable normalized log density (NLD) of codewords per unit volume, at
possibly large block length, that guarantees a vanishing error probability. For
a given finite block length and a fixed error probability, there is a gap
between the highest achievable NLD and Poltyrev's capacity. The dispersion
analysis quantifies asymptotically this gap.
  The thesis begins by the dispersion analysis of infinite constellations in
scalar fading channels. Later on, we extend the analysis to the case of
multiple input multiple output fading channels. As in other channels, we show
that the gap between the highest achievable NLD and the Poltyrev's capacity,
vanishes asymptotically as the square root of the channel dispersion over the
block length, multiplied by the inverse Q-function of the allowed error
probability.
  Moreover, exact terms for Poltyrev's capacity and channel dispersion, are
derived in the thesis. The relations to the amplitude and to the power
constrained fading channels are also discussed, especially in terms of
capacity, channel dispersion and error exponents. These relations hint that in
typical cases the unconstrained model can be interpreted as the limit of the
constrained model, when the signal to noise ratio tends to infinity.

management literature it is suggested that five dimensions characterise the

process improvement fit. Results from an empirical analysis are reported where
23 change agents evaluated the relative level of importance of each dimension.

standardized maximin optimality criteria are closely related to linear
optimality criteria. For the problem of discriminating between two polynomial
regression models which differ in the degree by two the robust T-optimal

to be a powerful focussing device for intense ion beams. A stable confined
electron column is used to provide strong radially symmetric electrostatic
focussing, e.g. for positively charged ion beams. The advantages of Gabor
lenses are a mass independent focussing strength, space charge compensation of
the ion beam and reduced magnetic or electric fields compared to conventional
focussing devices. Collective phenomena of the electron cloud result in
aberrations and emittance growth of the ion beam. The knowledge of the
behaviour of the electron cloud prevents a decrease of the beam brilliance.
Numerical models developed to describe the electron confinement and dynamics
within a Gabor lens help to understand the interaction of the ion beam with the
electron column and show the causes of non-neutral plasma instabilities. The
diagnosis of the electron cloud properties helps to evaluate the numerical
models and to investigate the influence of the ion beam on the confined

time reversal method for PAT that is based on the dissipative wave equation of
Nachman, Smith and Waag\cite{NaSmWa90}. This equation has the advantage that it
is more accurate than the \emph{thermo-viscous} wave equation. For simplicity,

\emph{relaxation time} $\tau_1$ and the \emph{compressibility} $\kappa_1$ of
the dissipative medium, and show $\I(\tau_1,\kappa_1)\to\varphi$ for
$\kappa_1\to 0$. This implies that $\I=\varphi$ holds in the dissipation-free
case and that $\I$ is similar to $\varphi$ for sufficiently small
compressibility $\kappa_1$. Moreover, we show for tissue similar to water that
the \emph{small wave number approximation} $\I_0$ of the time reversal image
satisfies $\I_0 = \eta_0 *_\x \varphi$ with $\hat \eta_0(|\k|)\approx const.$

growth, two molecules of carboplatin are bound to the His-15 residue. In
summary several new results have emerged: - firstly non-NaCl conditions showed
a carboplatin molecule bound to His-15 of HEWL; secondly binding of one
molecule of carboplatin was seen after one week of crystal growth and two
molecules were bound after five weeks of crystal growth; and thirdly the use of

of alpha = -3.8 +/- 0.2 and a pulse broadening time scale at 1 GHz of tau_GHz =
1.3 +/- 0.2 s, which is several orders of magnitude lower than the scattering
predicted by the NE2001 model (Cordes and Lazio 2002). If this scattering
timescale is representative of the GC as a whole, then previous surveys should
have detected many pulsars. The lack of detections implies either our
understanding of scattering in the GC is incomplete or there are fewer pulsars
in the GC than previously predicted. Given that magnetars are a rare class of
radio pulsar, we believe that there are many canonical and millisecond pulsars
in the GC, and not surprisingly, scattering regions in the GC have complex
spatial structures.

combines kinematic constraints, emergent topological defects, and magnetic long
range Coulomb interactions. In spin ice, magnetic frustration leads to highly
degenerate yet locally constrained ground states. Together, they form a highly
unusual magnetic state -- a ""Coulomb phase"" -- whose excitations are pointlike
defects -- magnetic monopoles -- in the absence of which effectively no
dynamics is possible. Hence, when they are sparse at low temperature, dynamics
becomes very sluggish. When quenching the system from a monopole-rich to a
monopole-poor state, a wealth of dynamical phenomena occur the exposition of
which is the subject of this article. Most notably, we find reaction diffusion
behaviour, slow dynamics due to kinematic constraints, as well as a regime
corresponding to the deposition of interacting dimers on a honeycomb lattice.
We also identify new potential avenues for detecting the magnetic monopoles in
a regime of slow-moving monopoles. The interest in this model system is further
enhanced by its large degree of tunability, and the ease of probing it in
experiment: with varying magnetic fields at different temperatures, geometric
properties -- including even the effective dimensionality of the system -- can
be varied. By monitoring magnetisation, spin correlations or zero-field Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance, the dynamical properties of the system can be extracted in
considerable detail. This establishes spin ice as a laboratory of choice for
the study of tunable, slow dynamics.

configurations (such as those recently discovered by Kepler) is dramatically
hindered at the planetesimal accretion stage. The combined action of the binary
and the protoplanetary disk acts to raise impact velocities between km-sized
planetesimals beyond their destruction threshold, halting planet formation
within at least 10 AU from the binary. It has been proposed that a primordial
population of ""large"" planetesimals (100 km or more in size), as produced by
turbulent concentration mechanisms, would be able to bypass this bottleneck;
however, it is not clear whether these processes are viable in the highly
perturbed circumbinary environments. We perform two-dimensional hydrodynamical
and N-body simulations to show that km-sized planetesimals and collisional
debris can drift and be trapped in a belt close to the central binary. Within
this belt, planetesimals could initially grow by accreting debris, ultimately
becoming ""indestructible"" seeds that can accrete other planetesimals in-situ
despite the large impact speeds. We find that large, indestructible
planetesimals can be formed close to the central binary within $10^5$ years,
therefore showing that even a primordial population of ""small"" planetesimals
can feasibly form a planet.

correlated low dimensional condensed matter systems in the presence of
localized impurities or topological defects. By exploiting the notion of Morita
equivalence for field theories on noncommutative two-tori and choosing rational

correspondence between the m-reduced conformal field theory describing the
quantum Hall fluid and an Abelian noncommutative field theory. As an example of
application of the formalism, we study a quantum Hall bilayer at
nonconventional fillings in the presence of a localized topological defect and
briefly recall its boundary state structure corresponding to two different
boundary conditions, the periodic as well as the twisted boundary conditions
respectively, which give rise to different topological sectors on a torus. Then
we introduce generalized magnetic translation operators as tensor products,
which act on the quantum Hall fluid and defect space respectively, and compute
their action on the boundary partition functions: in this way their role as
boundary condition changing operators is fully evidenced. From such results we
infer the general structure of generalized magnetic translations in our model

semihyper- groups as previously defined [33] and prove that results in this
respect. In this regard first we introduce fuzzy hyperoperation and then study
fuzzy gamma-hypersemigroup. We will proceed by study fuzzy gamma-hyperideals
and fuzzy gamma-bihyperideals. Also we study the relation between the classes
of fuzzy gamma-hypersemigroups and semigroups. Precisely, we associate a
gamma-hypersemigroup to every fuzzy hypersemigroup and vice versa. Finally, we
introduce and study fuzzy hypersemigroups regular and fuzzy strongly regular
relations of fuzzy gamma-hypersemigroups regular and fuzzy strongly regular
relations of fuzzy gamma-hypersemigroups.

theorem between clones and relational clones on a fixed possibly infinite set.
We also characterize the relational clone corresponding to the clone of all
finitary operations. By this characterization, we obtain correspondence between
finitary clones on a fixed infinite set and relational clones satisfying some
condition.

qualitative and reasonable quantitative agreement with the experimental data.
In particular, we explicitly show that even when the pseudogap has a pairing

the pseudogap temperature, as seen in experiment. We discuss the doping

mathematical modeling that living cells can multiplex a constant and an
oscillatory signal: they can transmit these two signals through the same
signaling pathway simultaneously, and yet respond to them specifically and
reliably. We find that information transmission is reduced not only by noise
arising from the intrinsic stochasticity of biochemical reactions, but also by
crosstalk between the different channels. Yet, under biologically relevant
conditions more than 2 bits of information can be transmitted per channel, even
when the two signals are transmitted simultaneously. These observations suggest
that oscillatory signals are ideal for multiplexing signals.

  Our technique is to study 2-representations of 2-quantum groups (in the sense
of Rouquier and Khovanov-Lauda) categorifying tensor products of irreducible
representations. These are the representation categories of certain finite
dimensional algebras with an explicit diagrammatic presentation, generalizing
the cyclotomic quotient of the KLR algebra. When the Lie algebra under
consideration is $\mathfrak{sl}_n$, we show that these categories agree with
certain subcategories of parabolic category O for gl_k.
  We also investigate the finer structure of these categories: they are
standardly stratified and satisfy a double centralizer property with respect to
their self-dual modules. The standard modules of the stratification play an
important role as test objects for functors, as Vermas do in more classical
representation theory.
  The existence of these representations has consequences for the structure of
previously studied categorifications. It allows us to prove the non-degeneracy
of Khovanov and Lauda's 2-category (that its Hom spaces have the expected
dimension) in all symmetrizable types, and that the cyclotomic quiver Hecke
algebras are symmetric Frobenius.
  In work of Reshetikhin and Turaev, the braiding and (co)evaluation maps
between representations of quantum groups are used to define polynomial knot
invariants. We show that the categorifications of tensor products are related
by functors categorifying these maps, which allow the construction of bigraded
knot homologies whose graded Euler characteristics are the original polynomial
knot invariants.

information. In the face of these data, researchers often employ methods to
extract reduced networks containing the most important structures or pathways,
sometimes known as `skeletons' or `backbones'. Numerous such methods have been
developed. Yet data are often noisy or incomplete, with unknown numbers of
missing or spurious links. Relatively little effort has gone into understanding
how salient network extraction methods perform in the face of noisy or
incomplete networks. We study this problem by comparing how the salient
features extracted by two popular methods change when networks are perturbed,
either by deleting nodes or links, or by randomly rewiring links. Our results
indicate that simple, global statistics for skeletons can be accurately
inferred even for noisy and incomplete network data, but it is crucial to have
complete, reliable data to use the exact topologies of skeletons or backbones.

  Hard Delay Constraints",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hou et al have introduced a framework to serve clients over wireless channels
when there are hard deadline constraints along with a minimum delivery ratio
for each client's flow. Policies based on ""debt,"" called maximum debt first
policies (MDF) were introduced, and shown to be throughput optimal. By
""throughput optimality"" it is meant that if there exists a policy that fulfils
a set of clients with a given vector of delivery ratios and a vector of channel
reliabilities, then the MDF policy will also fulfill them. The debt of a user
is the difference between the number of packets that should have been delivered
so as to meet the delivery ratio and the number of packets that have been
delivered for that client. The maximum debt first (MDF) prioritizes the clients
in decreasing order of debts at the beginning of every period. Note that a
throughput optimal policy only guarantees that \begin{small} $\liminf_{T \to
\infty} \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T} \mathbbm{1}\{\{client $n$'s packet is
delivered in frame $t$} \} \geq q_{i}$ \end{small}, where the right hand side
is the required delivery ratio for client $i$. Thus, it only guarantees that
the debts of each user are $o(T)$, and can be otherwise arbitrarily large. This
raises the interesting question about what is the growth rate of the debts
under the MDF policy. We show the optimality of MDF policy in the case when the
channel reliabilities of all users are same, and obtain performance bounds for
the general case. For the performance bound we obtain the almost sure bounds on
$\limsup_{t\to\infty}\frac{d_{i}(t)}{\phi(t)}$ for all $i$, where $\phi(t) =
\sqrt{2t\log\log t}$.

very small, nonlinear voids, below few Mpc radius, by considering the unsampled

halos. We develop analytical formula for the void abundance of both the
excursion set approach and the peaks formalism. These formula are valid for
random walks smoothed with a top-hat filter in real space, with a large class
of realistic barrier models. We test the extent to which the spherical
evolution approximation, which forms the basis of the analytical predictions,
models the highly aspherical voids that occur in the cosmic web, and are found
by a watershed-based algorithm such as zobov. We show that the volume function
returned by zobov is quite sensitive to the choice of treatment of sub-voids, a
fact that has not been appreciated previously. For reasonable choices of
sub-void exclusion, we find that the Lagrangian density delta_v of the zobov
voids -- which is predicted to be a constant delta_v = -2.7 in the spherical
evolution model -- is different from the predicted value, showing substantial
scatter and scale dependence. This result applies to voids identified at z=0
with effective radius between 1 and 10 Mpc/h. Our analytical approximations are
flexible enough to give a good description of the resulting volume function;
however, this happens for choices of parameter values that are different from
those suggested by the spherical evolution assumption. We conclude that
analytical models for voids must move away from the spherical approximation in
order to be applied successfully to observations, and we discuss some possible
ways forward.

to aberration in the direction of incoming photons and also modulation of the

transmit strategies for multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) systems. By employing BD-type
precoding algorithms at the transmit side, the MU-MIMO broadcast channel is
decomposed into multiple independent parallel single user MIMO (SU-MIMO)
channels and achieves the maximum diversity order at high data rates. The main
computational complexity of BD-type precoding algorithms comes from two
singular value decomposition (SVD) operations, which depend on the number of

low-complexity precoding algorithms are proposed to reduce the computational
complexity and improve the performance of BD-type precoding algorithms. We
devise a strategy based on a common channel inversion technique, QR

equivalent SU-MIMO channels. Analytical and simulation results show that the

local-field effects are found to be very important for Ag and Au and only
marginally relevant for Cu. We present an explanation for this surprising
behavior. Loss functions of all three metals possess a complex multi-peak

collective excitations, interband transitions, or mixed modes. The impact of
short-range correlations on the dynamic response functions are evaluated by
comparing the results of the random-phase approximation to those of the

W_n-representations is encoded into a single object we call an FI_W-module. We
prove that if an FI_W-module V satisfies a simple finite generation condition
then the structure of the sequence is highly constrained. One consequence is
that the sequence is uniformly representation stable in the sense of
Church-Farb, that is, the pattern of irreducible representations in the
decomposition of each V_n eventually stabilizes in a precise sense. Using the
theory developed here we obtain new results about the cohomology of generalized
flag varieties associated to the classical Weyl groups, and more generally the
r-diagonal coinvariant algebras.

interactions between the three families of groups. We use this theory to prove

measured by concurrence, fully entangled fraction, and quantum discord. This
result indicates that nonmaximally entangled states can outperform maximally
entangled states for quantum correlation distribution and storage under the
amplitude damping. It also educes a notable consequence that the ordering of
states under quantum correlation monotones can be reversed even by local
trace-preserving and completely positive maps.

Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), especially for Wireless Multimedia Sensor
Networks (WMSNs)where large volume of multimedia data is transmitted through
the network. If the traffic load is greater than the available capacity of the
sensor network, congestion occurs and it causes buffer overflow, packet drop,
deterioration of network throughput and quality of service (QoS). Again, the
faulty nodes of the network also aggravate congestion by diffusing useless
packets or retransmitting the same packet several times. This results in the
wastage of energy and decrease in network lifetime. To address this challenge,
a new congestion control algorithm is proposed in which the faulty nodes are
identified and blocked from data communication by using the concept of trust.
The trust metric of all the nodes in the WMSN is derived by using a two-stage
Fuzzy inferencing scheme. The traffic flow from source to sink is optimized by
implementing the Link State Routing Protocol. The congestion of the sensor
nodes is controlled by regulating the rate of traffic flow on the basis of the
priority of the traffic. Finally we compare our protocol with other existing
congestion control protocols to show the merit of the work.

We find that the major axes of galaxies in filaments tend to be preferentially

their major axes preferentially aligned parallel to the plane of the sheets.
The strength of this alignment signal is strongest for red, central galaxies,
and in good agreement with that of dark matter halos in N-body simulations.
This suggests that red, central galaxies are well aligned with their host

distribution of satellite galaxies. There is a luminosity and mass dependence
that brighter and more massive galaxies in filaments and sheets have stronger

strength and orientation, and the dot bias. In an in-plane magnetic field, the

enable the construction of high-order stochastic solutions by converting a

requires that the probability distribution of all random input variables is
known a priori, which is often not the case in industrially relevant
applications. Additionally, this method suffers from a curse of dimensionality,
i.e., the number of deterministic PDEs to be solved grows exponentially with
respect to the number of random variables. This paper presents an alternative
interpolation method, based on a radial basis function (RBF) metamodel, to
compute statistics of the stochastic PDE. The RBF metamodel can be constructed
even if the probability distribution of all random variables is not known.
Then, a lot of statistic scenarios with different probability distributions of
the random variables can be computed with this single metamodel. In order to
reduce the model complexity, we present a parameter screening technique which
can be combined with an interpolation method to solve a reduced stochastic
model. Numerical results of a model problem demonstrate that the RBF metamodel
is as fast as a low order collocation approach and achieves a good accuracy.
The parameter screening is able to reduce the dimension and, thus, to
accelerate the computation of the stochastic solution.

Bursts (GRBs) expands radially with acceleration and forms a shell with
constant width measured in the laboratory frame. When strong Lorentz factor
gradients are present within the shell it is supposed to spread at sufficiently
large radii. There are two possible mechanisms of spreading: hydrodynamical and
thermal ones. We consider both mechanisms evaluating the amount of spreading
that occurs during expansion up to the moment when the expanding shell becomes
transparent for photons. We compute the hydrodynamical spreading of an
ultrarelativistically expanding shell. In the case of thermal spreading we
compute the velocity spread as a function of two parameters: comoving
temperature and bulk Lorentz factor of relativistic Maxwellian distribution.
Based on this result we determine the value of thermal spreading of
relativistically expanding shell. We found that thermal spreading is negligible
for typical GRB parameters. Instead hydrodynamical spreading appears to be
significant, with the shell width reaching $\sim10^{10}$ cm for total energy
$E=10^{54}$ erg and baryonic loading $B=10^{-2}$. Within the fireshell model
such spreading will result in the duration of Proper Gamma-Ray Bursts up to

static space-times by their Noether symmetries. The determining equations for
Noether symmetries are obtained by using the usual Lagrangian of a general
spherically symmetric static spacetime which are integrated for each case. In
particular we observe that spherically symmetric static spacetimes are
categorized into six distinct classes corresponding to Noether algebra of
dimensions 5, 6, 7, 9, 11 and 17. Using Noether`s theorem we also write down
the first integrals for each class of such spacetimes corresponding to their
Noether symmetries. Some new spherically symmetric static solutions have also
been obtained.

modulation systems to achieve unequal error protection (UEP). We propose a new
UEP approach by partial superposition transmission called UEP-by-PST. In the
UEP-by-PST system, the information sequence is distinguished as two parts, the
more important data (MID) and the less important data (LID), both of which are
coded with LDPC codes. The codeword that corresponds to the MID is superimposed
on the codeword that corresponds to the LID. The system performance can be
analyzed by using discretized density evolution. Also proposed in this paper is
a criterion from a practical point of view to compare the efficiencies of
different UEP approaches. Numerical results show that, over both additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels and uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels, 1)
UEP-by-PST provides higher coding gain for the MID compared with the
traditional equal error protection (EEP) approach, but with negligible
performance loss for the LID; 2) UEP-by-PST is more efficient with the proposed
practical criterion than the UEP approach in the digital video broadcasting
(DVB) system.

properties of star-forming molecular clouds in galaxies and thereby investigate
how such a non-universal IMF (NUIMF) influences galaxy evolution. We
incorporate a NUIMF model into galaxy-scale chemodynamical simulations in order
to investigate the differences in chemical and dynamical evolution of disk
galaxies between the NUIMF and universal IMF (UIMF) models. In the adopted
NUIMF model, the three slopes of the Kroupa IMF depend independently on
densities and metallicities ([Fe/H]) of molecular gas clouds, and production
rates of metals and dust from massive and AGB stars can vary according to the
time evolution of the three IMF slopes. The preliminary results of the
simulations are as follows. Star formation rates in actively star-forming disk
galaxies can be significantly lower in the NUIMF model than in the UIMF model,
and the differences between the two models can be more remarkable in galaxies
with higher SFRs. Chemical enrichment can proceed more rapidly in the NUIMF
model and [Mg/Fe] for a given metallicity is higher in the NUIMF model. The
evolution of H2 fraction (f_H2) and dust-to-gas ratio (D) is more rapid in the
NUIMF model so that the final f_H2 and $D$ can be higher in the NUIMF model.
Formation of massive stellar clumps in gas-rich disks is more strongly
suppressed owing to the stronger SN feedback effect in the NUIMF model. The
radial density profiles of new stars within the central 1kpc are shallower in
the NUIMF model.

inertia (I), and the tidal deformability (Love number) of a neutron star were
shown to exist. They are nearly independent of the nuclear matter equation of
state and would be of great aid in extracting parameters from observed
gravitational-waves and in testing general relativity. These relations,
however, do not account for strong magnetic fields. We consider this problem by
studying the effect of a strong magnetic field on slowly rotating relativistic
neutron stars and show that, for simple magnetic field configurations that are
purely poloidal or purely toroidal, the relation between Q and I is again
nearly universal. However, different magnetic field geometries lead to
different I-Q relations, and, in the case of a more realistic twisted-torus
magnetic field configuration, the relation depends significantly on the
equation of state, losing its universality. I-Love-Q relations must thus be
used with very great care, since universality is lost for stars with long spin
periods, i.e. P > 10 s, and strong magnetic fields, i.e. B > 10^12 G.

The COSMOS data includes HST imaging and redshift measurements of 46 source

measurements of low mass systems. Our sample extends the mass range of the
lensing calibrated M-T relation an order of magnitude lower than any previous
study, resulting in a power-law slope of 1.48$^{+0.13}_{-0.09}$. The slope is
consistent with the self-similar model, predictions from simulations, and
observations of clusters. However, X-ray observations relying on mass
measurements derived under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium have
indicated that masses at group scales are lower than expected. Both simulations

Our external weak lensing masses provides the first observational support for
hydrostatic mass bias at group level, showing an increasing bias with
decreasing temperature and reaching a level of 30-50% at 1 keV.

small perturbations of the inputs of a system will cause only small
perturbations on its outputs. But it is not clear whether this property is
maintained at the implementation level, when two close inputs can lead to very
different execution paths. The problem becomes particularly crucial when
considering finite precision implementations, where any elementary computation
can be affected by a small error. In this context, almost every test is
potentially unstable, that is, for a given input, the computed (finite
precision) path may differ from the ideal (same computation in real numbers)
path. Still, state-of-the-art error analyses do not consider this possibility
and rely on the stable test hypothesis, that control flows are identical. If
there is a discontinuity between the treatments in the two branches, that is
the conditional block is not robust to uncertainties, the error bounds can be
unsound.
  We propose here a new abstract-interpretation based error analysis of finite
precision implementations, which is sound in presence of unstable tests. It
automatically bounds the discontinuity error coming from the difference between
the float and real values when there is a path divergence, and introduces a new
error term labeled by the test that introduced this potential discontinuity.
This gives a tractable error analysis, implemented in our static analyzer

spectroscopy and new Herschel SPIRE submm photometry from the HerMES program,
we derived robust total infrared luminosity (LIR) and dust mass (Md) estimates
and infered the relative contribution of the AGN to the infrared energy budget
of the sources. We found that the total infrared emission of galaxies with weak
6.2um PAH emission (EW<0.2um) is dominated by AGN activity, while for galaxies
with EW>0.2um more than 50% of the LIR arises from star formation. We also
found that for galaxies detected in the 250-500um Herschel bands an AGN has a
statistically insignificant effect on the temperature of the cold dust and the
far-IR colours of the host galaxy, which are primarily shaped by star formation
activity. For star-forming galaxies we reveal an anti-correlation between the
LIR-to-rest-frame 8um luminosity ratio, IR8 = LIR\L8, and the strength of PAH
features. We found that this anti-correlation is primarily driven by variations
in the PAHs emission, and not by variations in the 5-15um mid-IR continuum
emission. Using the [NeIII]/[NeII] line ratio as a tracer of the hardness of
the radiation field, we confirm that galaxies with harder radiation fields tend
to exhibit weaker PAH features, and found that they have higher IR8 values and
higher dust-mass-weighted luminosities (LIR/Md), the latter being a proxy for
the dust temperature (Td). We argue that these trends originate either from
variations in the environment of the star-forming regions or are caused by
variations in the age of the starburst. Finally, we provide scaling relations
that will allow estimating LIR, based on single-band observations with the
mid-infrared instrument, on board the upcoming JWST.

different resonance frequencies and different damping rates could work as a
nano-antenna for controlled mode switching and light routing. We calculate the
angular distribution of the emitted field detected in a far-field zone of the
system including the direct interatomic interactions and arbitrary linear
dimensions of the system. The calculation is carried out in terms of the
symmetric and antisymmetric modes of the two atom system. We find that as long
as the atoms are identical, the emission cannot be switched between the
symmetric and antisymmetric modes. The switching may occur when the atoms are
non-identical and the emission can then be routed to different modes by
changing the relative ratio of the atomic frequencies, or damping rates or by a
proper tuning of the laser frequency to the atomic resonance frequencies. It is
shown that in the case of atoms of different resonance frequencies but equal
damping rates, the light routing is independent of the frequency of the driving
laser field. It depends only on the sign of the detuning between the atomic
resonance frequencies. In the case of atoms of different damping rates, the
emission can be switched between different modes by changing the laser
frequency from the blue to red detuned from the atomic resonance. The effect of
the interatomic interactions is also considered and it is found that in the
case of unequal resonance frequencies of the atoms, the interactions slightly
modify the visibility of the intensity pattern. The case of unequal damping
rates of the atoms is affected rather more drastically, the light routing
becoming asymmetric under the dipole-dipole interaction with the enhanced

  inspiraling neutron star","Final version. Accepted for publication in mnras",,,,"astro-ph.SR astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the properties of jets launched by a neutron star spiralling inside
the envelope and core of a red supergiant. We propose that Thorne-Zytkow
objects (TZO) are unlikely to be formed via common envelope (CE) evolution if
accretion on to the neutron star can exceed the Eddington rate with much of the
accretion energy directed into jets that subsequently dissipate within the
giant envelope. We use the jet-feedback mechanism, where energy deposited by
the jets drives the ejection of the entire envelope and part of the core, and
find a very strong interaction of the jets with the core material at late
phases of the CE evolution. Following our results we speculate on two rare
processes that might take place in the evolution of massive stars. (1) Recent
studies have claimed that the peculiar abundances of the HV2112 RSG star can be
explained if this star is a TZO. We instead speculate that the rich-calcium
envelope comes from a supernova explosion of a stellar companion that was only
slightly more massive than HV2112, such that during its explosion HV2112 was
already a giant that intercepted a relatively large fraction of the SN ejecta.
(2) We raise the possibility that strong r-process nucleosynthesis, where
elements with high atomic weight of $A \ga 130$ are formed, occurs inside the
jets that are launched by the NS inside the core of the RSG star.

iterations (INI), to find the smallest eigenvalue and the associated positive
eigenvector of a large irreducible nonsingular M-matrix. The positivity of
approximations is critical in applications, and if the approximations lose the
positivity then they will be physically meaningless. We propose two different
inner tolerance strategies for solving the inner linear systems involved, and
prove that the resulting INI algorithms are globally linear and superlinear
with the convergence order $\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$, respectively. The proposed
INI algorithms are structure preserving and maintains the positivity of
approximate eigenvectors. We also revisit the exact Noda iteration and
establish a new quadratic convergence result. All the above is first done for
the problem of computing the Perron root and the positive Perron vector of an
irreducible nonnegative matrix and then adapted to that of computing the
smallest eigenpair of the irreducible nonsingular M-matrix. Numerical examples
illustrate that the proposed INI algorithms are practical, and they always
preserve the positivity of approximate eigenvectors. We compare them with the
positivity non-preserving Jacobi--Davidson method and implicitly restarted
Arnoldi method, which often compute physically meaningless eigenvectors, and
illustrate that the overall efficiency of the INI algorithms is competitive
with and can be considerably higher than the latter two methods.

$X=X_1\times X_2$ and $Y=Y_1\times Y_2$ of compact connected complex manifolds.
When $X_1$ is a Riemann surface of genus $\geq 2$, we show that any
non-constant holomorphic map $F:Y\to X$ is of a special form.

proliferation of Internet and Web 2.0 social media. People express their
attitudes and opinions on social media including blogs, discussion forums,
tweets, etc. and, sentiment analysis concerns about detecting and extracting
sentiment or opinion from online text. Sentiment based text classification is
different from topical text classification since it involves discrimination
based on expressed opinion on a topic. Feature selection is significant for
sentiment analysis as the opinionated text may have high dimensions, which can
adversely affect the performance of sentiment analysis classifier. This paper
explores applicability of feature selection methods for sentiment analysis and
investigates their performance for classification in term of recall, precision
and accuracy. Five feature selection methods (Document Frequency, Information
Gain, Gain Ratio, Chi Squared, and Relief-F) and three popular sentiment
feature lexicons (HM, GI and Opinion Lexicon) are investigated on movie reviews
corpus with a size of 2000 documents. The experimental results show that
Information Gain gave consistent results and Gain Ratio performs overall best
for sentimental feature selection while sentiment lexicons gave poor
performance. Furthermore, we found that performance of the classifier depends
on appropriate number of representative feature selected from text.

deviations, above a few GeV until about 100 GeV, from DGE models that use the
GALPROP code for the propagation of cosmic ray (CR) particles outside their
sources in the Galaxy and their interaction with the target distributions of
the interstellar gas and radiation fields. The surplus of radiation observed is
most pronounced in the inner Galaxy, where the concentration of CR sources is
strongest. The present study investigates this ""{\it Fermi}-LAT Galactic Plane
Surplus"" by estimating the \gr emission from the sources themselves, which is
disregarded in the above DGE models. It is shown that indeed the expected hard
spectrum of CRs, still confined in their sources (SCRs), can explain this
surplus. The method is based on earlier studies regarding the so-called EGRET
GeV excess which by now is generally interpreted as an instrumental effect. The
contribution from SCRs is predicted to increasingly exceed the DGE models also
above 100 GeV, up to \gr energies of about ten TeV, where the corresponding
surplus exceeds the hadronic part of the DGE by about one order of magnitude.
Above such energies the emission surplus should decrease again with energy due
to the finite life-time of the assumed supernova remnant sources. Observations
of the DGE in the inner Galaxy at 15 TeV with the Milagro \gr detector and, at
TeV energies, with the ARGO-YBJ detector are interpreted to provide
confirmation of a significant SCR contribution to the DGE.

as abstract quantities without semantics rather than as part of a

are Bayesian decision makers that perform hypothesis testing or signal
detection, and the dynamics are applied to prior probabilities of hypotheses.
Bounded confidence is defined on prior probabilities through Bayes risk error
divergence, the appropriate measure between priors in hypothesis testing. This
definition contrasts with the measure used between opinions in standard models:
absolute error. It is shown that the rapid convergence of prior probabilities
to a small number of limiting values is similar to that seen in the standard
Krause-Hegselmann model. The most interesting finding in this work is that the
number of these limiting values and the time to convergence changes with the
signal-to-noise ratio in the detection task. The number of final values or
clusters is maximal at intermediate signal-to-noise ratios, suggesting that the
most contentious issues lead to the largest number of factions. It is at these
same intermediate signal-to-noise ratios at which the degradation in detection
performance of the aggregate vote of the decision makers is greatest in
comparison to the Bayes optimal detection performance.

significant force not just for dust grains, but also for macroscopic bodies.
The absolute strength on the supposedly highly porous objects is not known in
detail as yet. We set up a low pressure torsion balance and studied
photophoretic forces. We investigated the dependence on plate dimensions and on
ambient pressure and considered the influence of channels through the plates.
As samples for full (no channel) plates we used tissue with 2mm thickness and
circular shape with diameters of 10mm, 30mm and 50mm. The influence of channels
was probed on rectangular-shaped circuit boards of 35mm x 35mm area and 1.5mm
thickness. The number of channels was 169 and 352. At low pressure, the
absolute photophoretic force is proportional to the cross section of the
plates. At high pressure, gas flow through the channels enhances the
photophoretic force. The pressure dependence of the radiative force can
(formally) be calculated by photophoresis on particles with a characteristic
length. We derived two characteristic length scales l depending on the plate
radius r_1, the channel radius r_2, and the thickness of the plate which equals
the length of the channel d as l=r^{0.35} x d^{0.65}. The highest force is
found at a pressure p_max = 15 x l^{-1}Pa mm. In total, the photophoretic force
on a plate with channels can be well described by a superposition of the two
components: photophoresis due to the overall size and cross section of the
plate and photophoresis due to the channels, both with their characteristic
pressure dependencies. We applied these results to the transport of large
solids in protoplanetary disks and found that the influence of porosity on the
photophoretic force can reverse the inward drift of large solids, for instance
meter-sized bodies, and push them outward within the optically thin parts of
the disk.

that these findings together with dedicated ground-based efforts now provide us
with a fairly complete picture and a good starting point to theoretical
investigations. Indeed, new, unpredicted dynamical phenomena have been
discovered in Blazhko RR Lyrae stars, such as period doubling, high-order
resonances, three-mode pulsation and low-dimensional chaos. These led to the
proposal of a new explanation to this century-old enigma, namely a high-order
resonance between radial modes. Along these lines I present the latest efforts
and advances from the theoretical point of view. Lastly, amplitude variations
in Cepheids are discussed.

and technological systems when the internal rhythms of their constituents are
adapted to be in unison as a result of their coupling. This natural tendency
towards dynamical consensus has spurred a large body of theoretical and
experimental research in recent decades. The Kuramoto model constitutes the
most studied and paradigmatic framework in which to study synchronization. In
particular, it shows how synchronization appears as a phase transition from a
dynamically disordered state at some critical value for the coupling strength
between the interacting units. The critical properties of the synchronization
transition of this model have been widely studied and many variants of its
formulations have been considered to address different physical realizations.
However, the Kuramoto model has been studied only within the domain of
classical dynamics, thus neglecting its applications for the study of quantum
synchronization phenomena. Based on a system-bath approach and within the
Feynman path-integral formalism, we derive equations for the Kuramoto model by
taking into account the first quantum fluctuations. We also analyze its
critical properties, the main result being the derivation of the value for the
synchronization onset. This critical coupling increases its value as
quantumness increases, as a consequence of the possibility of tunneling that
quantum fluctuations provide.

gravitational and electromagnetic fields of astrophysical compact objects has
been recently proved based on non-ideal MHD theory. These stationary structures
can represent plausible candidates for the modelling of coronal plasmas
expected to arise in association with accretion discs. However, accretion disc
coronae are formed by a highly diluted environment, and so the fluid
description may be inappropriate. The question is posed of whether similar
off-equatorial solutions can be determined also in the case of collisionless
plasmas for which treatment based on kinetic theory, rather than fluid one, is
demanded. In this paper the issue is addressed in the framework of the
Vlasov-Maxwell description for non-relativistic multi-species axisymmetric
plasmas subject to an external dominant spherical gravitational and dipolar
magnetic field. Equilibrium configurations are investigated and explicit
solutions for the species kinetic distribution function are constructed, which
are expressed in terms of generalized Maxwellian functions characterized by
isotropic temperature and non-uniform fluid fields. The conditions for the
existence of off-equatorial tori are investigated. It is proved that these
levitating systems are admitted under general conditions when both
gravitational and magnetic fields contribute to shaping the spatial profiles of
equilibrium plasma fluid fields. Then, specifically-kinetic effects carried by
the equilibrium solution are explicitly provided and identified here with
diamagnetic, energy-correction and electrostatic contributions. It is shown
that these kinetic terms characterize the plasma equation of state by
introducing non-vanishing deviations from the assumption of thermal pressure.

we consider the Maxwell system for the electric and the magnetic fields, in
order to investigate the well-posedness of the problem, in particular in
relation with the electric field in vacuum. At the free interface, driven by
the plasma velocity, the total pressure is continuous and the magnetic field on
both sides is tangent to the boundary.
  Under suitable stability conditions satisfied at each point of the
plasma-vacuum interface, we derive a basic a priori estimate for solutions to
the linearized problem. The proof follows by a suitable secondary
symmetrization of the Maxwell equations in vacuum and the energy method.
  An interesting novelty is represented by the fact that the interface is
characteristic with variable multiplicity, so that the problem requires a
different number of boundary conditions, depending on the direction of the
front velocity (plasma expansion into vacuum or viceversa). To overcome this
difficulty, we recast the vacuum equations in terms of a new variable which
makes the interface characteristic of constant multiplicity. In particular, we
don't assume that plasma expands into vacuum.

turn to be entire on the whole space after taking the desingularization.
Further we show that the desingularized function is given by a suitable finite

specific combinations of Bernoulli numbers attain the special values at their

continued to entire functions and their special values at non-positive integer

develop the study on analytic side of the Kubota-Leopoldt p-adic L-functions
(pLFs) into the multiple setting. We construct p-adic multiple L-functions

their intimate connection with the above complex MZFs by showing that the
special values of pMLFs at non-positive integers are expressed by the twisted
multiple Bernoulli numbers, the special values of the complex MZFs at
non-positive integers. (b) We extend Kummer congruence for Bernoulli numbers to
congruences for the twisted multiple Bernoulli numbers. (c) We extend the
vanishing property of the Kubota-Leopoldt pLFs with odd characters to our
pMLFs. (d) We establish their close relationship with the p-adic twisted

the widely used implicit large eddy simulations, which resolve a limited range
of length scales and treat the effect of turbulent velocity fluctuations below
the grid scale solely by numerical dissipation, we apply a subgrid-scale model
for the numerically unresolved fraction of the turbulence energy. For
simulations with adaptive mesh refinement, we utilize a new methodology that
allows us to adjust the scale-dependent energy variables in such a way that the
sum of resolved and unresolved energies is globally conserved. We test our
approach in simulations of randomly forced turbulence, a gravitationally bound
cloud in a wind, and the Santa Barbara cluster. To treat inhomogeneous
turbulence, we introduce an adaptive Kalman filtering technique that separates
turbulent velocity fluctuations on resolved length scales from the
non-turbulent bulk flow. From the magnitude of the fluctuating component and
the subgrid-scale turbulence energy, a total turbulent velocity dispersion of
several 100 km/s is obtained for the Santa Barbara cluster, while the
low-density gas outside the accretion shocks is nearly devoid of turbulence.
The energy flux through the turbulent cascade and the dissipation rate
predicted by the subgrid-scale model correspond to dynamical time scales around
5 Gyr, independent of numerical resolution.

that the UV {\it Hausdorff} dimension of momentum space which can be inferred
from this modified integration measure coincides with the short-distance {\it

scale-invariant fluctuations are obtained if the original model for two UV
spectral dimensions is combined with Einstein gravity. By studying the
properties of the inner product we derive the result that it is only in 2
energy-momentum dimensions that microphysical vacuum fluctuations are
scale-invariant. This is true ignoring gravity, but then we find that if
Einstein gravity is postulated in the original frame, in the dual picture
gravity switches off, since all matter becomes conformally coupled. We argue
that our findings imply that the following concepts are closely connected:
scale-invariance of vacuum quantum fluctuations, conformal invariance of the
gravitational coupling, UV reduction to spectral dimension 2 in position space
and UV reduction to Hausdorff dimension 2 in energy-momentum space.

semiconductors: an excellent agreement is obtained with existing ab initio
calculations from response theory in frequency domain [Luppi et al., Phys. Rev.
B 82, 235201 (2010)]. We finally show applications to the second-harmonic
generation of CdTe and the third-harmonic generation of Si.

milliarcsecond-scale radio structure of the supernova remnant SNR 4449$-$1 in
the galaxy NGC 4449. This young and superluminous remnant was observed at 1.6
GHz ($\lambda = 18$\,cm) with the European VLBI Network. The observations
confirm earlier identifications of this object with a supernova remnant (SNR)
while revealing a somewhat different morphology compared with the structure
reported by Bietenholz et al. from VLBI observations at 1.4 GHz. This
difference is discussed here in the context of structural sensitivity of both
observations. The 1.6 GHz image yields accurate estimates of the size (0.0422
arcsec $\times$ 0.0285 arcsec and 0.8 $\times$ 0.5 pc) and age ($\sim$55 yr) of
SNR 4449$-$1. With a total flux of 6.1 $\pm$ 0.6 mJy measured in the VLBI
image, the historical lightcurve of the source can be well represented by a
power-law decay with a power index of $-$1.19 $\pm$ 0.07. The SNR exhibits a
decline rate of the radio emission of 2.2$%$ $\pm$ 0.1$%$ yr$^{-1}$ and a radio
luminosity of 1.74 $\times$ 10$^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$.

need for computational methods for analyzing galaxy morphology. While the
morphology of most galaxies can be associated with a stage on the Hubble
sequence, morphology of galaxy mergers is far more complex due to the
combination of two or more galaxies with different morphologies and the
interaction between them. Here we propose a computational method based on
unsupervised machine learning that can quantitatively analyze morphologies of
galaxy mergers and associate galaxies by their morphology. The method works by
first generating multiple synthetic galaxy models for each galaxy merger, and
then extracting a large set of numerical image content descriptors for each
galaxy model. These numbers are weighted using Fisher discriminant scores, and
then the similarities between the galaxy mergers are deduced using a variation
of Weighted Nearest Neighbor analysis such that the Fisher scores are used as
weights. The similarities between the galaxy mergers are visualized using
phylogenies to provide a graph that reflects the morphological similarities
between the different galaxy mergers, and thus quantitatively profile the
morphology of galaxy mergers.

preserved and new information is added to history. All the information that may
ever be encoded in history must be about some fundamental, unique, atemporal
and pre-physical structure: the bare world. Scientists invent model worlds to
efficiently explain aspects of the real world. This paper explores the features
of and relationships between the bare, real, and model worlds. Time -- past,
present and future -- is naturally explained. Both quantum uncertainty and
state reduction are needed for time to progress, since unpredictable new
information must be added to history. Deterministic evolution preserves
existing information. Finite, but steadily increasing, information about the
bare world is jointly encoded in equally uncertain spacetime geometry and
quantum matter. Because geometry holds no information independent of matter,
there is no need to quantize gravity. At the origin of time, information goes
to zero and geometry and matter fade away.

  substantial text overlap with arXiv:1309.3917",,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate a method to deal with congestion of sectors and delays in the
tactical phase of air traffic flow and capacity management. It relies on
temporal objectives given for every point of the flight plans and shared among
the controllers in order to create a collaborative environment. This would
enhance the transition from the network view of the flow management to the
local view of air traffic control. Uncertainty is modeled at the trajectory
level with temporal information on the boundary points of the crossed sectors
and then, we infer the probabilistic occupancy count. Therefore, we can model
the accuracy of the trajectory prediction in the optimization process in order
to fix some safety margins. On the one hand, more accurate is our prediction;
more efficient will be the proposed solutions, because of the tighter safety
margins. On the other hand, when uncertainty is not negligible, the proposed
solutions will be more robust to disruptions. Furthermore, a multiobjective
algorithm is used to find the tradeoff between the delays and congestion, which
are antagonist in airspace with high traffic density. The flow management
position can choose manually, or automatically with a preference-based
algorithm, the adequate solution. This method is tested against two instances,
one with 10 flights and 5 sectors and one with 300 flights and 16 sectors.

treats the wave function as a spinor and gamma matrices as scalars, leading to
a quite complicated formalism with several pedagogic drawbacks. As an
alternative, I propose to teach Dirac equation and its Lorentz covariance by
using a much simpler, but physically equivalent formalism, in which these
drawbacks do not appear. In this alternative formalism, the wave function
transforms as a scalar and gamma matrices as components of a vector, such that
the standard physically relevant bilinear combinations do not change their
transformation properties. The alternative formalism allows also a natural
construction of some additional non-standard bilinear combinations with
well-defined transformation properties.

practical and important issue. In this paper, an iterative
reprojection-reconstruction (IRR) algorithm using a modified Papoulis-Gerchberg
(PG) iterative scheme is developed for reconstruction from limited-angle
projections which contain noise. The proposed algorithm has two iterative
update processes, one is the extrapolation of unknown data, and the other is
the modification of the known noisy observation data. And the algorithm
introduces scaling factors to control the two processes, respectively. The
convergence of the algorithm is guaranteed, and the method of choosing the
scaling factors is given with energy constraints. The simulation result
demonstrates our conclusions and indicates that the algorithm proposed in this
paper can obviously improve the reconstruction quality.

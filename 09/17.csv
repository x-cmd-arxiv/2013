implicit-solvent model governed by the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. Solvers
relying on a boundary integral representation typically do not consider
features like solvent-filled cavities or ion-exclusion (Stern) layers, due to
the added difficulty of treating multiple boundary surfaces. This has hindered
meaningful comparisons with volume-based methods, and the effects on accuracy
of including these features has remained unknown. This work presents a solver
called PyGBe that uses a boundary-element formulation and can handle multiple
interacting surfaces. It was used to study the effects of solvent-filled
cavities and Stern layers on the accuracy of calculating solvation energy and
binding energy of proteins, using the well-known APBS finite-difference code
for comparison. The results suggest that if required accuracy for an
application allows errors larger than about 2%, then the simpler,
single-surface model can be used. When calculating binding energies, the need
for a multi-surface model is problem-dependent, becoming more critical when
ligand and receptor are of comparable size. Comparing with the APBS solver, the
boundary-element solver is faster when the accuracy requirements are higher.
The cross-over point for the PyGBe code is in the order of 1-2% error, when
running on one GPU card (NVIDIA Tesla C2075), compared with APBS running on six
Intel Xeon CPU cores. PyGBe achieves algorithmic acceleration of the boundary
element method using a treecode, and hardware acceleration using GPUs via
PyCuda from a user-visible code that is all Python. The code is open-source

mysterious solar cycle is due to some kind of dark matter streams hitting the
Sun. Planetary gravitational lensing enhances (occasionally) slow moving flows
of dark constituents towards the Sun, giving rise to the periodic behaviour.
Jupiter provides the driving oscillatory force, though its 11.8 years orbital
period appears slightly decreased, just as 11 years, if the lensing impact of

we are given a graph $G$ and an integer $k$ as input, and asked whether at most
$k$ edges can be added to $G$ so that the resulting graph does not contain a
graph from ${\cal F}$ as an induced subgraph. It appeared recently that special
cases of ${\cal F}$-Completion, the problem of completing into a chordal graph
known as Minimum Fill-in, corresponding to the case of ${\cal
F}=\{C_4,C_5,C_6,\ldots\}$, and the problem of completing into a split graph,
i.e., the case of ${\cal F}=\{C_4, 2K_2, C_5\}$, are solvable in parameterized
subexponential time $2^{O(\sqrt{k}\log{k})}n^{O(1)}$. The exploration of this
phenomenon is the main motivation for our research on ${\cal F}$-Completion.
  In this paper we prove that completions into several well studied classes of
graphs without long induced cycles also admit parameterized subexponential time
algorithms by showing that:
  - The problem Trivially Perfect Completion is solvable in parameterized
subexponential time $2^{O(\sqrt{k}\log{k})}n^{O(1)}$, that is ${\cal
F}$-Completion for ${\cal F} =\{C_4, P_4\}$, a cycle and a path on four
vertices.
  - The problems known in the literature as Pseudosplit Completion, the case
where ${\cal F} = \{2K_2, C_4\}$, and Threshold Completion, where ${\cal F} =
\{2K_2, P_4, C_4\}$, are also solvable in time $2^{O(\sqrt{k}\log{k})}
n^{O(1)}$.
  We complement our algorithms for ${\cal F}$-Completion with the following
lower bounds:
  - For ${\cal F} = \{2K_2\}$, ${\cal F} = \{C_4\}$, ${\cal F} = \{P_4\}$, and
${\cal F} = \{2K_2, P_4\}$, ${\cal F}$-Completion cannot be solved in time
$2^{o(k)} n^{O(1)}$ unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails.
  Our upper and lower bounds provide a complete picture of the subexponential
parameterized complexity of ${\cal F}$-Completion problems for ${\cal
F}\subseteq\{2K_2, C_4, P_4\}$.

Splash singularities have been shown to hold for the free boundary
incompressible Euler equation in the form of the water waves contour evolution
problem \cite{ADCPJ}. Our result confirms the numerical simulations in
\cite{CFMR} where it is shown that the curvature blows up due to the contours
collapsing at a point. Here we prove that maintaining control of the curvature
will remove the possibility of pointwise interphase collapse. Another
conclusion that we provide is a better understanding of the work \cite{DP3} in
which squirt singularities are ruled out; here a positive volume of fluid
between the contours can not be ejected in finite time.

has been implemented and tested using our Astrobiology Phone-cam system, which
employs Bluetooth communication to send images to a local laptop server in the
field for the image-compression analysis. We tested the system in a field site
displaying a heterogeneous suite of sandstones, limestones, mudstones and
coalbeds. Some of the rocks are partly covered with lichen. The image-matching
procedure of this system performed very well with data obtained through our
field test, grouping all images of yellow lichens together and grouping all
images of a coal bed together, and giving a 91% accuracy for similarity
detection. Such similarity detection could be employed to make maps of
different geological units. The novelty-detection performance of our system was
also rather good (a 64% accuracy). Such novelty detection may become valuable
in searching for new geological units, which could be of astrobiological
interest. The image-comparison technique is an unsupervised technique that is
not capable of directly classifying an image as containing a particular
geological feature; labeling of such geological features is done post facto by
human geologists associated with this study, for the purpose of analyzing the
system's performance. By providing more advanced capabilities for similarity
detection and novelty detection, this image-compression technique could be
useful in giving more scientific autonomy to robotic planetary rovers, and in
assisting human astronauts in their geological exploration and assessment.

multi-output (MIMO) X-channel in which channel state information is provided
with one-unit delay to both transmitters (CSIT), and each receiver feeds back
its channel output to a different transmitter. We refer to this model as MIMO
X-channel with asymmetric output feedback and delayed CSIT. The transmitters
are equipped with M-antennas each, and the receivers are equipped with
N-antennas each. For this model, accounting for both messages at each receiver,
we characterize the optimal sum secure degrees of freedom (SDoF) region. We
show that, in presence of asymmetric output feedback and delayed CSIT, the sum
SDoF region of the MIMO X-channel is same as the SDoF region of a two-user MIMO
BC with 2M-antennas at the transmitter, N-antennas at each receiver and delayed
CSIT. This result shows that, upon availability of asymmetric output feedback
and delayed CSIT, there is no performance loss in terms of sum SDoF due to the
distributed nature of the transmitters. Next, we show that this result also
holds if only output feedback is conveyed to the transmitters, but in a
symmetric manner, i.e., each receiver feeds back its output to both
transmitters and no CSIT. We also study the case in which only asymmetric
output feedback is provided to the transmitters, i.e., without CSIT, and derive
a lower bound on the sum SDoF for this model. Furthermore, we specialize our
results to the case in which there are no security constraints. In particular,
similar to the setting with security constraints, we show that the optimal sum
DoF region of the (M,M,N,N)--MIMO X-channel with asymmetric output feedback and
delayed CSIT is same as the DoF region of a two-user MIMO BC with 2M-antennas
at the transmitter, N-antennas at each receiver, and delayed CSIT. We
illustrate our results with some numerical examples.

significant implications: the Lagrangian duality of the equivalent max-min
problem provides an elegant way to establish the sum-rate duality between an
interference network and its reciprocal when such a duality exists, and more
importantly, suggests a novel iterative minimax algorithm for the weighted
sum-rate maximization. Moreover, the design and convergence proof of the
algorithm use only general convex analysis. They apply and extend to any
max-min problems with similar structure, and thus provide a general class of
algorithms for such optimization problems. This paper presents a promising step
and lends hope for establishing a general framework based on the minimax
Lagrangian duality for characterizing the weighted sum-rate and developing
efficient algorithms for general MIMO interference networks.

are analogous). Likewise, with representations of dog, house, and kennel, an
algorithm should be able to recognize that the semantic composition of dog and
house, dog house, is highly similar to kennel (dog house and kennel are
synonymous). It seems that these two tasks, recognizing relations and
compositions, are closely connected. However, up to now, the best models for
relations are significantly different from the best models for compositions. In
this paper, we introduce a dual-space model that unifies these two tasks. This
model matches the performance of the best previous models for relations and
compositions. The dual-space model consists of a space for measuring domain
similarity and a space for measuring function similarity. Carpenter and wood
share the same domain, the domain of carpentry. Mason and stone share the same
domain, the domain of masonry. Carpenter and mason share the same function, the
function of artisans. Wood and stone share the same function, the function of
materials. In the composition dog house, kennel has some domain overlap with
both dog and house (the domains of pets and buildings). The function of kennel
is similar to the function of house (the function of shelters). By combining
domain and function similarities in various ways, we can model relations,
compositions, and other aspects of semantics.

(e.g., NOT, CNOT, SWAP, Toffoli, Fredkin) are self-inverse and are represented
by square matrices that are unitary and Hermitian. However, with a simple
minded argument, it is established that the most of the allowed reversible
gates are non-self-inverse (unitary but non-Hermitian) in nature. It is also
shown that the % of non-Hermitian gates increases with the dimension. For
example, 58.33% of the 2-bit gates, 98.10% of the 3-bit gates and 99.99% of the
4-bit gates are non-Hermitian. As classical reversible gates are essentially
permutation gates, above statistics is strictly valid for classical reversible
gates, but the argument can be easily extended to include quantum gates and to
establish that the majority of the quantum gates are also non-self-inverse.
Further, the % of genuinely 2-bit reversible gates (i.e., 2-bit gates that

gates has been computed as 83.3%, and the applicability of this analysis in the
optimization of circuit cost is discussed.

(Hall current) can be explained in terms of the Lorentz forces present when
charged particles flow in an external magnetic field. However, as established
in the very early work of Edwin Hall, ferromagnetic conductors such as Fe, Co,
and Ni have an anomalous Hall conductivity contribution that cannot be
attributed to Lorentz forces and therefore survives in the absence of a
magnetic field. Although the anomalous Hall effect is experimentally strong, it
has stood alone among metallic transport effects for much of the last century
because it lacked a usefully predictive, generally accepted theory. Progress
over the past decade has explained why. It is now clear that the anomalous Hall
effect in ferromagnets has contributions from both extrinsic scattering
mechanisms similar to those that determine most transport coefficients, and
from an intrinsic mechanism that is independent of scattering. The anomalous
Hall effect is also observed in paramagnets, which have nonzero magnetization
induced by an external magnetic field. Although no explicit relationship has
been established, the anomalous Hall effect in a particular material is usually
assumed to be proportional to its magnetization. In this work we point out that
it is possible to have an anomalous Hall effect in a noncollinear
antiferromagnet with zero net magnetization provided that certain common
symmetries are absent, and predict that Mn3Ir, a technologically important
antiferromagnetic material with noncollinear order that survives to very high
temperatures, has a surprisingly large anomalous Hall effect comparable in size
to those of the elemental transition metal ferromagnets.

explored. The degree to which turbulence affects the burning front decreases
with increasing ignition radius since the buoyancy force is stronger at larger
radii. Even central ignition --- in the presence of a background convective
flow field --- is rapidly carried off-center as the flame is carried by the
flow field. We compare our results to analytic models for burning thermals, and
find that they reproduce the general trends of the bubble's size and mass, but
underpredict the amount of buoyant acceleration due to simplifying assumptions
of the bubble's properties. Overall, we find that the amount of mass that burns
prior to flame break out is small, consistent with a ""gravitationally confined
detonation"" occurring at a later epoch, but additional burning will occur
following breakout that may modify this conclusion.

of a false vacuum. Negative spatial curvature is one possibility, but the
window for its detection is now small. However, another possible signal is a
suppression of the CMB power spectrum at large angles. This arises from the
steepening of the effective potential as it interpolates between a flat
inflationary plateau and the high barrier separating us from our parent vacuum.
We demonstrate that these two effects can be parametrically separated in
angular scale.
  Observationally, the steepening effect appears to be excluded at large l; but
it remains consistent with the slight lack of power below l about 30 found by
the WMAP and Planck collaborations. We give two simple models which improve the
fit to the Planck data; one with observable curvature and one without. Despite
cosmic variance, we argue that future CMB polarization and most importantly
large-scale structure observations should be able to corroborate the Planck
anomaly if it is real.
  If we further assume the specific theoretical setting of a landscape of
metastable vacua, as suggested by string theory, we can estimate the
probability of seeing a low-l suppression in the CMB. There are significant
theoretical uncertainties in such calculations, but we argue the probability
for a detectable suppression may be as large as O(1), and in general is
significantly larger than the probability of seeing curvature.

extraterrestrial neutrino flux. During two years of operation 28 events with
energies between 30 TeV and 1.2 PeV were observed while only 10.6 events were
expected from conventional atmospheric backgrounds. The hadronic interactions
responsible for this IceCube excess will also produce a flux of high-energy
gamma-rays that can serve as a probe of source direction and distance. We show
that existing TeV to PeV diffuse gamma-ray limits support the interpretation
that the IceCube excess is mostly of extragalactic origin. However, we point
out that gamma-ray surveys are biased in the Northern Hemisphere whereas the
recent IceCube data tentatively show a weak preference for the Southern Sky.
Possible sub-dominant contributions from Galactic neutrino sources like
remnants of supernovae and hypernovae are marginally consistent with present
gamma-ray limits. This emphasizes the importance of future diffuse TeV to PeV
gamma-ray surveys in the Southern Hemisphere, particularly in the extended
region around the Galactic Center including the Fermi Bubbles.

these invariants. For many real symplectic manifolds, these results reduce all
genus 0 real invariants with conjugate pairs of constraints to genus 0
invariants with a single conjugate pair of constraints. In particular, we give
a complete recursion for counts of real rational curves in odd-dimensional
projective spaces with conjugate pairs of constraints and specify all cases
when they are nonzero and thus provide non-trivial lower bounds in
high-dimensional real algebraic geometry. We also show that the real invariants
of the three-dimensional projective space with conjugate point constraints are
congruent to their complex analogues modulo 4.

  problems","49 pages",,,,"math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dirac algorithm allows to construct Hamiltonian systems for singular systems,
and so contributing to its successful quantization. A drawback of this method
is that the resulting quantized theory does not have manifest Lorentz
invariance. This motivated the quest of alternatives to the usual Hamiltonian
theory on the space of sections; a particular instance of this search is the so
called restricted Hamiltonian theory, where the equations of motion of a field
theory are formulated by means of a multisymplectic structure, a kind of
generalization of the symplectic form to the multidimensional context, and even
a constraint algorithm working in this context has been proposed. In the
present article we will try to provide partial aswers to two questions
intimately related with these issues: First, to assign multisymplectic spaces
to variational problems in the Griffiths formalism in such a way that the
equations of motion can be written as restricted Hamiltonian systems, and
second, to propose a covariant Dirac-like algorithm suitable to work with them;
it must be recalled that given the Griffiths formalism contains the classical
variational problems as particular instances, it yields to a novel covariant
algorithm for deal with constraints in field theory. Moreover, in this
formulation the constraint algorithm becomes simply the Cartan algorithm
designed for deal with Pfaffian systems.

structural parameters, most importantly the quantum dot thickness, on the
optical properties are also investigated through statistical correlations among
multiple optical properties of many individual quantum dots. We found that in a
single dot the strain-induced polarization field and the strain relaxation at
the sidewall form a potential barrier to protect the exciton from reaching the
sidewall surface. However, the exciton can overcome this potential barrier and
recombine nonradiatively at the surface through two mechanisms: tunnelling
through the barrier quantum mechanically and hopping over the barrier by
attaining sufficient thermal energy. The former (latter) mechanism is
temperature insensitive (sensitive) and dominates nonradiaitve exciton decay at
low (high) temperatures. We also found that despite the good uniformities in
structural parameters, all optical properties still exhibit inhomogeneities
from dot to dot. However, all these inhomogeneities can be modeled by simply
varying the potential barrier height, which also explains the observed
correlation curves among all optical properties. Finally, we found that the
biexciton-to-exciton quantum efficiency ratio, which determines the probability
of multi-photon emission, can be tuned by adjusting the potential barrier
height and the temperature, suggesting a new way to achieve single photon
emission at high temperatures.

relatively faint, especially compared to Type Ia SNe. The common explanation
for these events involves a weak explosion, producing a radioactive outflow
with small ejected mass and kinetic energy (M ~ 0.1 Msun and E ~ 0.1 B,
respectively), perhaps from the detonation of a helium shell on a white dwarf.
We argue, in contrast, that these events may be Type Ib/c SNe with typical
masses and energies (M ~ 3 Msun, E ~ 1 B), but which ejected very little
radioactive material. In our picture, the light curve is powered by the
diffusion of thermal energy deposited by the explosion shock wave, and the
rapid evolution is due to recombination, which reduces the opacity and results
in an ""oxygen-plateau"" light curve. Using a radiative transfer code, we
generate synthetic spectra and light curves and demonstrate that this model can
reasonably fit the observations of one event, SN 2010X. Similar models may
explain the features of other rapidly evolving SNe such as SN 2002bj and SN
2005ek. SNe such as these require stripped-envelope progenitors with rather
large radii (R ~ 20 Rsun), which may originate from a mass loss episode
occurring just prior to explosion.

feedback from the first generation of stars altered the contents of the
interstellar medium, the universe switched to a low-mass mode of star
formation, which continues in the high metallicity stars formed in the present
era. Several studies have investigated the transition between metal-free and
metal-enriched star formation, with tentative evidence being found for a
metallicity threshold near 10^-3.5 Z_sun due to atomic and molecular
transitions and another threshold near 10^-5.5 Z_sun due to dust. In this work,
we simulate the formation of stars in idealized low-metallicity halos using the
AMR code Enzo. We conduct several simulations of 10^6 M_sun and 10^7 M_sun
halos in which the metal content, initial rotation, and degree of turbulence
are varied in order to study the effect of these properties on gas
fragmentation over a range of densities. We find tentative support for the idea
of a critical metallicity, but the effect of varying metallicity on the gas we
observe is not as dramatic as what has been reported in earlier studies. We
find no clear relation between the initial spin or the initial level of
turbulence in the halo and the final properties of the gas contained therein.
Additionally, we find that the degree to which the Jeans length is refined, the
initial density profile of the gas, and the inclusion of deuterium chemistry
each have a significant effect on the evolution and fragmentation of the gas in
the halo - in particular, we find that at least 64 grid cells are needed to
cover the Jeans length in order to properly resolve the fragmentation.

derive SFR from ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) luminosities. A stacking
technique is adopted to measure IR emission for galaxies undetected at 24
micron. We confirm that the slope of the mass-SFR relation is close to unity.
We examine the distributions of specific SFRs (SSFRs) in four equally spaced
mass bins from 10^9.5 M_sun to 10^11.5 M_sun. Different models are used to
constrain the scatter of SSFR for lower mass galaxies that are mostly
undetected at 24 micron. The SFR scatter is dominated by the scatter of UV
luminosity and gradually that of IR luminosity at increasing stellar mass. We
derive SSFR dispersions of 0.18, 0.21, 0.26 and 0.31 dex with a typical
measurement uncertainty of <~ 0.01 dex for the four mass bins. Interestingly,
the scatter of the mass-SFR relation seems not constant in the sense that the
scatter in SSFR is smaller for SFGs of stellar mass <10^10.5 M_sun. If
confirmed, this suggests that the physical processes governing star formation
become systematically less violent for less massive galaxies. The SSFR
distribution for SFGs with intermediate mass 10^10-10^10.5 M_sun is
characterized by a prominent excess of intense starbursts in comparison with
other mass bins. We argue that this feature reflects that both violent (e.g.,

the tension may be ameliorated once the effect of baryonic depletion on the
cluster mass function is taken into account. We use the large-volume Millennium
Gas simulations in our study, including one where the gas is pre-heated at high
redshift and one where the gas is heated by stars and active galactic nuclei
(in the latter, the self-gravity of the baryons and radiative cooling are
omitted). In both cases, the cluster baryon fractions are in reasonably good
agreement with the data at low redshift, showing significant depletion of
baryons with respect to the cosmic mean. As a result, it is found that the
cluster abundance in these simulations is around 15 per cent lower than the
commonly-adopted fit to dark matter simulations by Tinker et al (2008) for the
mass range $10^{14}-10^{14.5}h^{-1} \mathrm{M}_\odot$. Ignoring this effect
produces a significant artificial shift in cosmological parameters which can be
expressed as $\Delta[\sigma_8(\Omega_\mathrm{m}/0.27)^{0.38}]\simeq -0.03$ at
$z=0.17$ (the median redshift of the $\mathit{Planck}$ cluster sample) for the
feedback model. While this shift is not sufficient to fully explain the
$\mathit{Planck}$ discrepancy, it is clear that such an effect cannot be
ignored in future precision measurements of cosmological parameters with
clusters. Finally, we outline a simple, model-independent procedure that
attempts to correct for the effect of baryonic depletion and show that it works
if the baryon-dark matter back-reaction is negligible.

the centers of such groups. Mock observations of the central remnants confirm
their similarity to ellipticals, despite having no dissipational component. We
vary the profile of the original spiral's bulge and find that ellipticals
formed from spirals with exponential bulges have too low Sersic indices.
Mergers of spirals with de Vaucouleurs (classical) bulges produce remnants with
larger Sersic indices correlated with luminosity, as with SDSS ellipticals.
Exponential bulge mergers are better fits to faint ellipticals, whereas
classical bulge mergers better match luminous ellipticals. Similarly, luminous
ellipticals are better reproduced by remnants undergoing many (>5) mergers, and
fainter ellipticals by those with fewer mergers.
  The remnants follow tight size-luminosity and velocity dispersion-luminosity
(Faber-Jackson) relations (<0.12 dex scatter), demonstrating that stochastic
merging can produce tight scaling relations if the merging galaxies also follow
tight scaling relations. The slopes of the size-luminosity and Faber-Jackson
relations are close to observations but slightly shallower in the former case.
Both relations' intercepts are offset - remnants are too large but have too low
dispersions at fixed luminosity. Some remnants show substantial (v/\sigma >
0.1) rotational support, although most are slow rotators and few are very fast
rotators (v/\sigma > 0.5).
  These findings contrast with previous studies concluding that dissipation
necessary to produce ellipticals from binary mergers of spirals. Multiple,
mostly minor and dry mergers can produce bright ellipticals, whereas
significant dissipation could be required to produce faint, rapidly-rotating

HI 21 cm absorption spectroscopy towards 32 compact extra-galactic radio
sources with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) and the Westerbork
Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT). The optical depth spectra for most sources
have root mean square noise values \lesssim 10^{-3} per 1 km/s velocity channel
and are thus sufficiently sensitive to detect absorption by warm neutral
hydrogen with HI column densities N_HI \gtrsim 10^{20} cm^{-2}, spin
temperatures T_s \leq 5000 K, and line widths equal to the thermal width (20
km/s). HI 21 cm absorption was detected against all background sources but one,
B0438-436. The spectra of sources observed separately with GMRT and WSRT show
excellent agreement, indicating that spectral baseline problems and
contamination from HI 21 cm emission are negligible. This paper presents the
absorption spectra, the emission spectra along neighbouring sightlines from the
Leiden-Argentine-Bonn survey, and the derived spin temperature spectra. On
every sightline, the maximum spin temperature detected (at \ge 3 sigma
significance) even at a velocity resolution of 1 km/s is \gtrsim 1000 K,
indicating that we are detecting the warm neutral medium along most sightlines.
This is by far the largest sample of Galactic HI 21 cm absorption spectra of
this quality, providing a sensitive probe of physical conditions in the neutral

from the Leiden-Argentine-Bonn (LAB) survey, we show that some of the
absorption detected on most sightlines must arise in gas with temperatures
higher than that in the stable cold neutral medium (CNM). A multi-Gaussian
decomposition of 30 of the HI 21 cm absorption spectra yielded very few
components with line widths in the temperature range of stable WNM, with no
such WNM components detected for sixteen of the thirty sightlines. We find that
some of the detected HI 21 cm absorption along thirteen of these sightlines
must arise in gas with spin temperatures larger than the CNM range. For these
sightlines, we use very conservative estimates of the CNM spin temperature and
the non-thermal broadening to derive strict upper limits to the gas column
densities in the CNM and WNM phases. Comparing these upper limits to the total
HI column density, we find that typically at least 28% of the gas must have
temperatures in the thermally unstable range (200-5000 K). Our observations
hence robustly indicate that a significant fraction of the gas in the Galactic
interstellar medium has temperatures outside the ranges expected for thermally
stable gas in two-phase models.

whether it is variable or fixed. We use a further suite of simulations to
emphasise the importance of the H-ATLAS PACS data for deriving dust

provided an important new way to realize topologically ordered states in
lattice models. In earlier works, on-site and nearest neighbor Hubbard-like
interactions have been used extensively to stabilize Abelian FCIs in systems
with nearly flat, topologically nontrivial bands. However, attempts to use
two-body interactions to stabilize non-Abelian FCIs, where the ground state in
the presence of impurities can be massively degenerate and manipulated through
anyon braiding, have proven very difficult in uniform lattice systems. Here, we
study the remarkable effect of long-range interactions in a lattice model that
possesses an exactly flat lowest band with a unit Chern number. When spinless
bosons with two-body long-range interactions partially fill the lowest Chern
band, we find convincing evidence of gapped, bosonic Read-Rezayi (RR) phases
with non-Abelian anyon statistics. We characterize these states through
studying topological degeneracies, the overlap between the ground states of
two-body interactions and the exact RR ground states of three- and four-body
interactions, and state counting in the particle-cut entanglement spectrum.
Moreover, we demonstrate how an approximate lattice form of Haldane's
pseudopotentials, analogous to that in the continuum, can be used as an
efficient guiding principle in the search for lattice models with stable
non-Abelian phases.

density limit of 1 Jy at 23 GHz, 54 of which (68%) have a clearly detected
`blue bump'. Thirty-four of the latter have, in the literature, black hole mass
estimates obtained with the virial method. The mass estimates obtained from the
two methods are well correlated. If the calibration factor of the virial
relation is set to $f=4.5$, well within the range of recent estimates, the mean
logarithmic ratio of the two mass estimates is equal to zero with a dispersion
close to the estimated uncertainty of the virial method. The fact that the two
independent methods agree so closely in spite of the potentially large
uncertainties associated with each lends strong support to both of them. The
distribution of black-hole masses for the 54 FSRQs in our sample with a well
detected blue bump has a median value of $7.4\times 10^{8}\,M_\odot$. It
declines at the low mass end, consistent with other indications that radio loud
AGNs are generally associated with the most massive black holes, although the
decline may be, at least partly, due to the source selection. The distribution
drops above $\log(M_\bullet/M_\odot) = 9.4$, implying that ultra-massive black

Together with already known superorbital periodicities in 2S 0114+650 and IGR
J16493-4348, the systems exhibit a monotonic relationship between superorbital
and orbital periods. These systems include both supergiant fast X-ray
transients (SFXTs) and classical supergiant systems, and have a range of
inclination angles. This suggests an underlying physical mechanism which is
connected to the orbital period. In addition to these sources with clear
detections of superorbital periods, IGR J16393-4643 (= AX J16390.4-4642) is
identified as a system that may have superorbital modulation due to the
coincidence of low-amplitude peaks in power spectra derived from BAT, RXTE PCA,
and INTEGRAL light curves. 1E 1145.1-6141 may also be worthy of further
attention due to the amount of low-frequency modulation of its light curve.

universal feature of wind-accretion supergiant X-ray binaries.

the most luminous star-formation region in the Milky Way. It covers the entire

an all-configuration SMA mosaic in the 230-GHz band covering the central 3
arcmin (10 pc, known as W49N), with most of the embedded massive stars; and 2)
PMO 14m telescope observations in the 90-GHz band, covering the entire GMC with
maps up to 35 arcmin in size, or 113 pc. We also make use of archival data from
the VLA, JCMT-SCUBA, IRAM 30m, and the CSO BOLOCAM GPS. Our main findings are:
1) The W49 GMC is one of the most massive in the Galaxy, with a total mass
~1.1x10^6 Msun within a radius of 60 pc. Within a radius of 6 pc, the total gas
mass is ~2x10^5 Msun. At these scales only 1% of the material is photoionized.
The mass reservoir is sufficient to form several young massive clusters (YMCs)
as massive as a globular cluster. 2) The mass of the GMC is distributed in a
hierarchical network of filaments. At scales <10 pc, a triple, centrally
condensed structure peaks toward the ring of HC HII regions in W49N. This
structure extends to scales from ~10 to 100 pc. The W49A starburst most likely
formed from global gravitational contraction with localized collapse in a
""hub-filament"" geometry. 3) Currently, feedback from the central YMCs (with a
present mass Mcl > 5x10^4 Msun) is still not enough to entirely disrupt the
GMC, but further stellar mass growth could be enough to allow radiation
pressure to clear the cloud and halt star formation. 4) The resulting stellar
content will probably remain as a gravitationally bound massive star cluster,
or a small system of bound clusters. (ABRIDGED)

through acousto-optical modulation ; the Four-Wave Mixing (FWM) signal is then
selected in the frequency domain. The interference of an auxiliary continuous
wave laser, which is sent through the same interferometers as the excitation

the photocurrent FWM signal. This scheme enables the partial compensation of
mechanical fluctuations in the setup, achieving sufficient phase stability
without the need for active stabilization. The method intrinsically provides
both the real and imaginary parts of the FWM signal as a function of

multi-dimensional spectrum. Measurements made on the excitonic resonance in a

evolution to address the question of complexity that can arise through
Darwinian mechanisms. Valiant views evolution as a restricted form of
computational learning, where the goal is to evolve a hypothesis that is close
to the ideal function. Feldman (2008) showed that (correlational) statistical
query learning algorithms could be framed as evolutionary mechanisms in
Valiant's model. P. Valiant (2012) considered evolvability of real-valued
functions and also showed that weak-optimization algorithms that use
weak-evaluation oracles could be converted to evolutionary mechanisms.
  In this work, we focus on the complexity of representations of evolutionary
mechanisms. In general, the reductions of Feldman and P. Valiant may result in
intermediate representations that are arbitrarily complex (polynomial-sized
circuits). We argue that biological constraints often dictate that the
representations have low complexity, such as constant depth and fan-in
circuits. We give mechanisms for evolving sparse linear functions under a large
class of smooth distributions. These evolutionary algorithms are
attribute-efficient in the sense that the size of the representations and the

finite energy QCD sum rules. Results show that the rho-meson width increases
whereas its mass and leptonic decay constant decrease near the (chemical
potential-dependent) critical temperature T_c(mu) for chiral symmetry
restoration/quark-gluon deconfinement. As a consequence, starting from T_c(mu),
for a short lived cooling the main effect is a broadening of the dimuon
distribution. However, when the evolution brings the system to a lower
freeze-out temperature, with the rho-meson parameters approaching their vacuum
values, the dimuon distribution shows a broad peak centered at the vacuum
rho-meson mass. For even lower freeze-out temperatures the peak becomes less
prominent since the thermal phase space factor suppresses the distribution for
larger values of the invariant dimuon mass, given that the average temperature
is smaller. The dimuon distribution exhibits a non-trivial behavior with mu.
For small mu values the distribution broadens with increasing mu becoming a bit
steeper at low invariant masses for larger values of mu. Our results are in
very good agreement with data from the NA60 Collaboration.

To reduce the operational overhead of the HetNet, proper identification of the
set of serving BSs becomes an important design issue. In this work, we show
that by jointly optimizing the transceivers and determining the active set of
BSs, high system resource utilization can be achieved with only a small number
of BSs. In particular, we provide formulations and efficient algorithms for
such joint optimization problem, under the following two common design
criteria: i) minimization of the total power consumption at the BSs, and ii)
maximization of the system spectrum efficiency. In both cases, we introduce a
nonsmooth regularizer to facilitate the activation of the most appropriate BSs.
We illustrate the efficiency and the efficacy of the proposed algorithms via
extensive numerical simulations.

We investigate the impact of different routing models in this robust setting:
in particular, we compare \emph{oblivious} routing, where the routing between
each terminal pair must be fixed in advance, to \emph{dynamic} routing, where
routings may depend arbitrarily on the current demand. Our main result is a
construction that shows that the optimal cost of such a network based on
oblivious routing (fractional or integral) may be a factor of
$\BigOmega(\log{n})$ more than the cost required when using dynamic routing.
This is true even in the important special case of the asymmetric hose model.
This answers a question in \cite{chekurisurvey07}, and is tight up to constant

networks, especially at higher frequencies. Unfortunately, such blockage
effects are either neglected or characterized by oversimplified models in the
analysis of cellular networks. Leveraging concepts from random shape theory,
this paper proposes a mathematical framework to model random blockages and
analyze their impact on cellular network performance. Random buildings are
modeled as a process of rectangles with random sizes and orientations whose
centers form a Poisson point process on the plane. The distribution of the
number of blockages in a link is proven to be Poisson random variable with
parameter dependent on the length of the link. A path loss model that
incorporates the blockage effects is proposed, which matches experimental
trends observed in prior work. The model is applied to analyze the performance
of cellular networks in urban areas with the presence of buildings, in terms of
connectivity, coverage probability, and average rate. Analytic results show
while buildings may block the desired signal, they may still have a positive
impact on network performance since they can block significantly more
interference.

lines and/or in continua may be cast in a so-called reduced form for six
reduced components of the radiation field. In this formalism the six components
of the reduced source function are angle-independent quantities. It thus
reduces drastically the storage requirement of numerical codes. This approach
encounters a fundamental problem when the medium is illuminated by a polarized
incident radiation, because there is a priori no way of relating the known (and
measurable) Stokes parameters of the incident radiation to boundary conditions
for the reduced equations. The origin of this problem is that there is no
unique way of deriving the radiation reduced components from its Stokes
parameters (only the inverse operation is clearly defined). The method proposed
here aims at enabling to work with arbitrary incident radiation field
(polarized or unpolarized). In previous works an ad-hoc treatment of the
boundary conditions, applying to cases where the incident radiation is
unpolarized, has been used. In this note we show that it is possible to account
for the incident radiation in a rigorous way, without any assumption on its
properties, by expressing the radiation field as the sum of a directly
transmitted radiation and of a so-called diffuse radiation. The diffuse
radiation field obeys a transfer equation with no incident radiation that may
be solved in the reduced form. The first scattering of the incident radiation
introduces primary creation terms in the six components of the reduced source
function. Once the reduced polarized transfer problem is solved for the diffuse
radiation field, its Stokes parameters can be computed. We perform numerical
computations of such cases, showing that the emergent line-polarization may be
significantly affected by the polarization of the incident radiation.

consider the problem of estimating an infection source for a
Susceptible-Infected model, in which not all infected nodes can be observed.
When the network is a tree, we show that an estimator for the source node
associated with the most likely infection path that yields the limited
observations is given by a Jordan center, i.e., a node with minimum distance to
the set of observed infected nodes. We also propose approximate source
estimators for general networks. Simulation results on various synthetic
networks and real world networks suggest that our estimators perform better
than distance, closeness, and betweenness centrality based heuristics.

develop a sparsity-promoting variant of the standard DMD algorithm. In our
method, sparsity is induced by regularizing the least-squares deviation between

Coexistence of two superconducting phases is observed, in which the low

Tc phase has Tc higher than 40 K. These data also delineate an x - T phase
diagram in which the single magnetic/structural phase transition in undoped

are suppressed with increasing La substitution. Superconductivity emerges when
x is about 0.06 and coexists with the structural/magnetic transition until x is

is totally suppressed, and Tc reaches its maximum value of about 45 K for 0.15

Swift revealed that gamma-ray and optical light curves of this flat spectrum
radio quasars are highly correlated, but with an exception of one large optical
flare having no corresponding gamma-ray activity or even detection. On the
other hand, recent advances in SNRs observations and plasma simulations both
reveal that magnetic field downstream of astrophysical shocks can be largely
amplified beyond simple shock compression. These amplifications, along with
their associated particle acceleration, might contribute to blazar flares,
including the peculiar flare of PKS 0208-512. Using our time dependent
multizone blazar emission code, we evaluate several scenarios that may
represent such phenomena. This code combines Monte Carlo method that tracks the
radiative processes including inverse Compton scattering, and Fokker-Planck
equation that follows the cooling and acceleration of particles. It is a
comprehensive time dependent code that fully takes into account the light
travel time effects. In this study, both the changes of the magnetic field and
acceleration efficiency are explored as the cause of blazar flares. Under these
assumption, synchrotron self-Compton and external Compton scenarios produce
distinct features that favor the external Compton scenario. The optical flares
with/without gamma-ray counterparts can be explained by different allocations
of energy between the magnetization and particle acceleration, which in turn
can be affected by the relative orientation between the magnetic field and the
shock flow. We compare the details of the observations and simulation, and
highlight what implications this study has on our understanding of relativistic
jets.

sparse linear models in high-dimensional settings with possibly many endogenous
regressors. In particular, the number of endogenous regressors in the main
equation and the instruments in the first-stage equations can grow with and
exceed the sample size n. The analysis concerns the exact sparsity case, i.e.,
the maximum number of non-zero components in the vectors of parameters in the
first-stage equations, k1, and the number of non-zero components in the vector
of parameters in the second-stage equation, k2, are allowed to grow with n but
slowly compared to n. I consider the high-dimensional version of the two-stage
least square estimator where one obtains the fitted regressors from the
first-stage regression by a least square estimator with l_1-regularization (the
Lasso or Dantzig selector) when the first-stage regression concerns a large
number of instruments relative to n, and then construct a similar estimator
using these fitted regressors in the second-stage regression. The main
theoretical results of this paper are non-asymptotic bounds from which I
establish sufficient scaling conditions on the sample size for estimation
consistency in l_2-norm and variable-selection consistency. A technical issue
regarding the so-called ""restricted eigenvalue (RE) condition"" for estimation
consistency and the ""mutual incoherence (MI) condition"" for selection
consistency arises in the two-stage estimation from allowing the number of
regressors in the main equation to exceed n and this paper provides analysis to
verify these RE and MI conditions. Depending on the underlying assumptions, the
upper bounds on the l_2-error and the sample size required to obtain these
consistency results differ by factors involving k1 and/or k2. Simulations are
conducted to gain insight on the finite sample performance.

ozonolysis was investigated at 298 and 288 K using a laminar flow reactor. A
volatility tandem differential mobility analyzer (VTDMA) was used to measure
the evaporation of the SOA, enabling the parameterization of its volatility
properties. The parameters extracted included the temperature at which 50% of
the aerosol had evaporated (TVFR0.5) and the slope factor (SVFR). An increase
in SVFR indicates a broader distribution of vapor pressures for the aerosol
constituents. Reducing the reaction temperature increased SVFR and decreased
TVFR0.5 under humid conditions but had less effect on TVFR0.5 under dry
conditions. In general, higher water concentrations gave lower TVFR0.5 values,
more negative SVFR values, and a reduction in total SOA production. The radical
conditions were changed by introducing OH scavengers to generate systems with
and without OH radicals and with different [HO2]/[RO2] ratios. Presence of a
scavenger and lower [HO2]/[RO2] ratio reduced SOA production. Observed changes
in SVFR values could be linked to the more complex chemistry that occurs in the
absence of a scavenger, and indicated that additional HO2 chemistry gives
products with a wider range of vapor pressures. Updates to existing ozonolysis
mechanisms with routes that describe the observed responses to water and
radical conditions for monoterpenes with endocyclic and exocyclic double bonds

approximate the nonconvex weighted sum- rate maximization (WSRM) problem with a
solvable convex form by means of a sequential parametric convex approximation

electrodes at constant electrical potential is presented. Several types of
electrode geometries have been investigated by many groups in order to model
planar, corrugated and porous materials and we summarize the results obtained
in terms of the structure of the liquids. This structure governs the quantity
of charge which can be stored at the surface of the electrode for a given
applied potential, which is the relevant quantity for the highly topical use of
ionic liquids in supercapacitors (also known as electrochemical double-layer
capacitors). A key feature, which was also shown by atomic force microscopy and
surface force apparatus experiments, is the formation of a layered structure
for all ionic liquids at the surface of planar electrodes. This organization
cannot take place inside nanoporous electrodes, which results in a much better
performance for the latter in supercapacitors. The agreement between
simulations and electrochemical experiments remains qualitative only though,
and we outline future directions which should enhance the predictive power of
computer simulations. In the longer term, atomistic simulations will also be
applied to the case of electron transfer reactions at the interface, enabling
the application to a broader area of problems in electrochemistry, and the few

signal-to-noise ratio greater than 3), in a region of 4' radius; 43 of those
are above a flux density limit of 20 mJy. This is a factor of 3.6 in excess
over the average in the four control fields, considering only the sources above
20 mJy. We also find an excess in the number counts of sources with 250 micron
flux densities between 30 and 40 mJy, compared to deep extragalactic
blank-field number counts. Assuming a fixed dust temperature (30 K) and
emissivity (beta=1.5) a crude, blackbody-derived redshift distribution, zBB, of
the detected sources is significantly different from the distributions in the
control fields and exhibits a significant peak at zBB ~ 1.5, although the
actual peak redshift is highly degenerate with the temperature. We tentatively
suggest, based on zBB and the similar S250/S350 colours of the sources within
the peak, that a significant fraction of the sources in the clump may be at a
similar redshift. Since the overdensity lies ~7' south of the z=2.16 Spiderweb
protocluster MRC1138-26, an intriguing possibility (that is presently
unverifiable given the data in hand) is that it lies within the same
large-scale structure.(abridged)

over a certain kind of reflective submanifold in a symmetric space are
anisotropic isoparametric and anisotropic equifocal hypersurfaces.

of the nucleon, of how to split the total angular momentum of a photon or gluon
into spin and orbital contributions is one of the most important and
interesting challenges faced by gauge theories like Quantum Electrodynamics and
Quantum Chromodynamics. This is particularly challenging since all QED
textbooks state that such an splitting cannot be done for a photon (and a
fortiori for a gluon) in a gauge-invariant way, yet experimentalists around the
world are engaged in measuring what they believe is the gluon spin! This
question has been a subject of intense debate and controversy, ever since, in
2008, it was claimed that such a gauge-invariant split was, in fact, possible.
We explain in what sense this claim is true and how it turns out that one of
the main problems is that such a decomposition is not unique and therefore
raises the question of what is the most natural or physical choice. The
essential requirement of measurability does not solve the ambiguities and leads
us to the conclusion that the choice of a particular decomposition is
essentially a matter of taste and convenience. In this review, we provide a
pedagogical introduction to the question of angular momentum decomposition in a
gauge theory, present the main relevant decompositions and discuss in detail
several aspects of the controversies regarding the question of gauge
invariance, frame dependence, uniqueness and measurability. We stress the
physical implications of the recent developments and collect into a separate
section all the sum rules and relations which we think experimentally relevant.
We hope that such a review will make the matter amenable to a broader community
and will help to clarify the present situation.

derived with the space-time dependent radion field playing a crucial role.
Taking a re-look at this effective theory, we find cosmological and spherically
symmetric, static solutions sourced by a radion--induced, effective stress
energy, as well as additional, on-brane matter. The distance between the branes
(governed by the time or space dependent radion) is shown to be stable and
asymptotically non-zero, thereby setting aside any possibility of brane
collisions. It turns out that the inclusion of on-brane matter plays a decisive
role in stabilising the radion - a fact which we demonstrate through our
solutions.

and demonstrated. The number of ejected particles and their velocities can be
controlled by two parameters, the threshold of the potential and the
interparticle interaction. Since these parameters are fully under experimental
control, this is also the case for the number of ejected particles and their
emission spectrum. The process of tunneling to open space can hence be used,
for example, for the quantum simulation of complicated tunneling ionization
processes and atom lasers. To understand the many-body tunneling process, a
generalization of the model introduced in [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 109,
13521 (2012)] for tunneling in the absence of a threshold is put forward and
proven to apply for systems with a non-zero threshold value. It is demonstrated
that the model is applicable for general interparticle interaction strengths,
particle numbers and threshold values. The model constructs the many-body
process from single-particle emission processes. The rates and emission momenta
of the single-particle processes are determined by the chemical potentials and
energy differences to the threshold value of the potential for systems with
different particle numbers. The chemical potentials and these energy
differences depend on the interparticle interaction. Both the number of
confined particles and their rate of emission thus allow for a control by the
manipulation of the interparticle interaction and the threshold. Numerically
exact results for two, three and one hundred bosons are shown and discussed.
The devised control scheme for the many-body tunneling process performs very
well for the dynamics of the momentum density, the correlations, the coherence
and of the final state, i.e., the number of particles that remain confined in
the potential.

experimentally demonstrated [C. Vitelli et al., Nature Photon. 7, 521 (2013)]
that corresponds to the transfer of the internal two-dimensional quantum states
of two input photons, i.e., two photonic qubits, into the four-dimensional
quantum state of a single photon, i.e., a photonic ququart. A scheme for the
inverse process, namely ""quantum state splitting"", has also been theoretically
proposed. Both processes can be iterated in a cascaded layout, to obtain the
joining and/or splitting of more than two qubits, thus leading to a general
scheme for varying the number of photons in the system while preserving its
total quantum state, or quantum information content. Here, we revisit these
processes from a theoretical point of view. After casting the theory of the
joining and splitting processes in the more general photon occupation number
notation, we introduce some modified schemes that are in principle unitary (not
considering the implementation of the CNOT gates) and do not require projection
and feed-forward steps. This can be particularly important in the quantum state
splitting case, to obtain a scheme that does not rely on postselection.
Moreover, we formally prove that the quantum joining of two photon states with
linear optics requires the use of at least one ancilla photon. This is somewhat
unexpected, given that the demonstrated joining scheme involves the sequential
application of two CNOT quantum gates, for which a linear optical scheme with
just two photons and postselection is known to exist. Finally we explore the
relationship between the joining scheme and the generation of clusters of
multi-particle entangled states involving more than one qubit per particle.

the distance moduli of stars for which the RAdial Velocity Experiment (RAVE)

modulus suffice for roughly half the stars, with most of the other half having
satisfactory two-Gaussian representations. As expected, early-type stars rarely
require more than one Gaussian. The expectation value of distance is larger
than the distance implied by the expectation of distance modulus; the latter is
itself larger than the distance implied by the expectation value of the

by Hipparcos, so the expectation of parallax is the most reliable distance

improved when these pdfs are used to make the diagram. We use the method of

systematic errors for general stars and confirm that the most reliable distance

highly excited heavy nuclei on core-collapse supernova simulations, following
the evolution up to several 100 ms after core bounce. Our study is based on the
AGILE-Boltztran supernova code, which features general relativistic radiation
hydrodynamics and accurate three-flavor Boltzmann neutrino transport in
spherical symmetry. In our simulations the nuclear de-excitation process is
described in two different ways. At first we follow the approach proposed by
Fuller and Meyer [Astrophys. J. 376,701 (1991)], which is based on strength
functions derived in the framework of the nuclear Fermi-gas model of
non-interacting nucleons. Secondly, we parametrize the allowed and forbidden
strength distributions in accordance with measurements for selected nuclear
ground states. We determine the de-excitation strength by applying the Brink
hypothesis and detailed balance. For both approaches, we find that nuclear
de-excitation has no effect on the supernova dynamics. However, we find that
nuclear de-excitation is the leading source for the production of electron
antineutrinos as well as heavy-lepton flavor (anti)neutrinos during the
collapse phase. At sufficiently high densities, the associated neutrino spectra
are influenced by interactions with the surrounding matter, making proper
simulations of neutrino transport important for the determination of the
neutrino-energy loss rate. We find that even including nuclear de-excitations,
the energy loss during the collapse phase is overwhelmingly dominated by
electron neutrinos produced by electron captures.

kinematic groups such as the Hercules stream. Assuming that Hercules is caused
by the effects of the Outer Lindblad Resonance of the Galactic bar, we model
analytically its properties as a function of position in the Galaxy and its
dependence on the bar's pattern speed and orientation. Using data from the RAVE
survey we find that the azimuthal velocity of the Hercules structure decreases
as a function of Galactocentric radius, in a manner consistent with our
analytical model. This allows us to obtain new estimates of the parameters of
the Milky Way's bar. The combined likelihood function of the bar's pattern
speed and angle has its maximum for a pattern speed of $\Omega_b=(1.89 \pm
0.08) \times \Omega_0$ where $\Omega_0$ is the local circular frequency.
Assuming a Solar radius of 8.05 kpc and a local circular velocity of 238 km/s,
this corresponds to $\Omega_b=56\pm 2$ km/s/kpc. On the other hand, the bar's
orientation $\phi_b$ cannot be constrained with the available data. In fact,
the likelihood function shows that a tight correlation exists between the
pattern speed and the orientation, implying that a better description of our
best fit results is given by the linear relation $\Omega_b/\Omega_0=1.91 +
0.0044[\phi_b(\deg)-48]$, with standard deviation of 0.02. For example, for an
angle of $\phi_b=30\deg$ the pattern speed is $54.0\pm0.5$ km/s/kpc. These
results are not very sensitive to the other Galactic parameters such as the
circular velocity curve or the peculiar motion of the Sun, and are robust to
biases in distance.

where interstellar lines are rarely blended with stellar ones. The need for hot
stars is a strong limitation in the number of sightlines we can observe and the
distribution of sightlines in the Galaxy, as hot stars are rare and
concentrated in the Galactic plane. We are introducing a new method, where
interstellar lines can be observed in spectra of cool stars in large
spectroscopic surveys. The method is completely automated and does not require
prior knowledge of the stellar parameters. If known, the stellar parameters
only reduce the computational time and are not involved in the extraction of
the interstellar spectrum. The main step in extracting interstellar lines is a
construction of the stellar spectrum, which is in our method done by finding
other observed spectra that lack interstellar features and are otherwise very
similar to the spectrum in question. Such spectra are then combined into a
single stellar spectrum template, which matches the stellar component in an
observed spectrum. We demonstrate the performance of this new method on a
sample of 482,430 spectra observed in RAVE survey. However, many spectra have
to be combined (48 on average) in order to achieve a S/N ratio high enough to
measure the DIB's profile, hence limiting the spatial information about the
ISM. Only one strong interstellar line is included in the RAVE spectral range,
a diffuse interstellar band at 8620 \AA. We compare its equivalent width with
extinction maps and with Bayesian reddening, calculated for individual stars,
and provide a linear relation between the equivalent width and reddening.
Separately from the introduced method, we calculate equivalent widths of the
diffuse interstellar band in spectra of hot stars with known extinction and
compare all three linear relations with each other and with relations from the
literature.

emission component in calcium lines. Here we use a spectral subtraction
technique to measure the properties of this emission. Synthetic templates are
replaced by the observed spectra of non-active stars to bypass the difficult
computations of non-LTE profiles of the line cores and stellar parameter
dependence. We derive both the equivalent width of the excess emission for each
calcium line on a 5\AA\ wide interval and their sum EW_IRT for ~44,000
candidate active dwarf stars with S/N>20 and with no respect to the source of
their emission flux. From these ~14,000 show a detectable chromospheric flux
with at least 2\sigma\ confidence level. Our set of active stars vastly
enlarges previously known samples. Atmospheric parameters and in some cases
radial velocities of active stars derived from automatic pipeline suffer from
systematic shifts due to their shallower calcium lines. We re-estimate the
effective temperature, metallicity and radial velocities for candidate active
stars. The overall distribution of activity levels shows a bimodal shape, with
the first peak coinciding with non-active stars and the second with the pre
main-sequence cases. The catalogue will be publicly available with the next

and Fe along the Galactic radius to provide new constraints on the chemical
evolution models of the Galaxy and Galaxy models such as the Besancon model.
  Methods: We analysed three different samples selected from three independent
datasets: a sample of 19,962 dwarf stars selected from the RAVE database, a
sample of 10,616 dwarf stars selected from the Geneva-Copenhagen Survey (GCS)
dataset, and a mock sample (equivalent to the RAVE sample) created by using the
GALAXIA code, which is based on the Besancon model. We measured the chemical
gradients as functions of the guiding radius (Rg) at different distances from
the Galactic plane reached by the stars along their orbit (Zmax).
  Results: The chemical gradients of the RAVE and GCS samples are negative and
show consistent trends, although they are not equal: at Zmax<0.4 kpc and
4.5<Rg(kpc)<9.5, the iron gradient for the RAVE sample is d[Fe/H]/dRg=-0.065
dex kpc^{-1}, whereas for the GCS sample it is d[Fe/H]/dRg=-0.043 dex kpc^{-1}
with internal errors +-0.002 and +-0.004 dex kpc^{-1}, respectively. The
gradients of the RAVE and GCS samples become flatter at larger Zmax.
Conversely, the mock sample has a positive iron gradient of
d[Fe/H]/dRg=+0.053+-0.003 dex kpc^{-1} at Zmax<0.4 kpc and remains positive at
any Zmax. These positive and unrealistic values originate from the lack of
correlation between metallicity and tangential velocity in the Besancon model.
The discrepancies between the observational samples and the mock sample can be
reduced by i) decreasing the density, ii) decreasing the vertical velocity, and
iii) increasing the metallicity of the thick disc in the Besancon model.

networks. An example of its application is the location of sounds by barn owls
that requires especially precise temporal coding. Dependent upon the azimuthal
angle, the arrival times of sound signals are shifted between both ears. In
order to deter- mine these interaural time differences, the phase difference of
the signals is measured. We implemented this biologically inspired network on a
neuromorphic hardware system and demonstrate spike-timing dependent plasticity
on an analog, highly accelerated hardware substrate. Our neuromorphic
implementation enables the resolution of time differences of less than 50 ns.
On-chip Hebbian learning mechanisms select inputs from a pool of neurons which
code for the same sound frequency. Hence, noise caused by different synaptic
delays across these inputs is reduced. Furthermore, learning compensates for
variations on neuronal and synaptic parameters caused by device mismatch
intrinsic to the neuromorphic substrate.

We split the sample into hot

giants are consistent with being identical with those of non-clump giants. We
fit Gaussian velocity ellipsoids to the meridional-plane components of velocity
of each star class and give formulae from which the shape and orientation of
the velocity ellipsoid can be determined at any location. The data are
consistent with the giants and the cool dwarfs sharing the same velocity
ellipsoids; sigma_z rises from 21 kms in the plane to sim 55 kms at |z|=2 kpc,
while sigma_r rises from 37 kms to 82 kms. At (R,z) the longest axis of one of
these velocity ellipsoids is inclined to the Galactic plane by an angle ~0.8
arctan(z/R). We use a novel formula to obtain precise fits to the highly
non-Gaussian distributions of v_phi components.
  We compare the observed velocity distributions with the predictions of a
dynamical model fitted to the velocities of stars that lie within ~150 pc of
the Sun and star counts towards the Galactic pole. The model accurately
reproduces the non-Gaussian nature of the v_r and v_z distributions and
provides excellent fits to the data for v_z at all locations. The model v_phi
distributions for the cool dwarfs fit the data extremely well, while those for
the hot dwarfs have displacements to low v_phi that grow with |z| from very
small values near the plane. At |z|>0.5 kpc, the theoretical v_phi
distributions for giants show a deficit of stars with large v_phi and the model
v_r distributions are too narrow. Systematically over-estimating distances by
20 per cent introduces asymmetry into the model v_r and v_z distributions near
the plane and but significantly improves the fits to the data at |z|>0.5 kpc.
The quality of the fits lends credence to the assumed, disc-dominated,
gravitational potential.

patients with different survival time following diagnosis or treatment. While
the log-rank test is widely used for this purpose, nearly all implementations
of the log-rank test rely on an asymptotic approximation that is not
appropriate in many genomics applications. This is because: the two populations
determined by a genetic variant may have very different sizes; and the
evaluation of many possible variants demands highly accurate computation of
very small p-values. We demonstrate this problem for cancer genomics data where
the standard log-rank test leads to many false positive associations between
somatic mutations and survival time. We develop and analyze a novel algorithm,
Exact Log-rank Test (ExaLT), that accurately computes the p-value of the
log-rank statistic under an exact distribution that is appropriate for any size
populations. We demonstrate the advantages of ExaLT on data from published
cancer genomics studies, finding significant differences from the reported
p-values. We analyze somatic mutations in six cancer types from The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA), finding mutations with known association to survival as
well as several novel associations. In contrast, standard implementations of
the log-rank test report dozens-hundreds of likely false positive associations
as more significant than these known associations.

the computational efficiency of our algorithm, we split the Lagrangian dynamics
into several parts such that a part of the dynamics can be handled analytically

Galactocentric radii using the latest data release of the Radial Velocity
Experiment (RAVE DR4). Compared to previous studies we have a database larger
by a factor of 10 as well as reliable distance estimates for almost all stars.
Our analysis is based on the statistical analysis of a rigorously selected
sample of 90 high-velocity halo stars from RAVE and a previously published data
set. We calibrate and extensively test our method using a suite of cosmological
simulations of the formation of Milky Way-sized galaxies. Our best estimate of
the local Galactic escape speed, which we define as the minimum speed required
to reach three virial radii $R_{340}$, is $533^{+54}_{-41}$ km/s (90%
confidence) with an additional 5% systematic uncertainty, where $R_{340}$ is
the Galactocentric radius encompassing a mean over-density of 340 times the
critical density for closure in the Universe. From the escape speed we further
derive estimates of the mass of the Galaxy using a simple mass model with two
options for the mass profile of the dark matter halo: an unaltered and an
adiabatically contracted Navarro, Frenk & White (NFW) sphere. If we fix the
local circular velocity the latter profile yields a significantly higher mass
than the un-contracted halo, but if we instead use the statistics on halo
concentration parameters in large cosmological simulations as a constraint we
find very similar masses for both models. Our best estimate for $M_{340}$, the
mass interior to $R_{340}$ (dark matter and baryons), is $1.3^{+0.4}_{-0.3}
\times 10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ (corresponding to $M_{200} = 1.6^{+0.5}_{-0.4} \times

entangled pure state fermionic systems based on the Spin group. Our
generalization uses the fact that there is a representation of this group
acting on the fermionic Fock space which when restricted to fixed particle
number subspaces recovers naturally the usual SLOCC transformations. The new
ingredient is the occurrence of Bogoliubov transformations of the whole Fock
space changing the particle number. The classification scheme built on the Spin
group prohibits naturally entanglement between states containing even and odd
number of fermions. In our scheme the problem of classification of entanglement
types boils down to the classification of spinors where totally separable
states are represented by so called pure spinors. We construct the basic
invariants of the Spin group and show how some of the known SLOCC invariants
are just their special cases. As an example we present the classification of
fermionic systems with a Fock space based on six single particle states. An
intriguing duality between two different possibilities for embedding
three-qubit systems inside the fermionic ones is revealed. This duality is
elucidated via an interesting connection to configurations of wrapped membranes
reinterpreted as qubits.

  We search for new nearby objects companions of known high proper motion (HPM)

background contamination presented a major problem to previous works.
  The common proper motion (PM) method was used--we inspected the area around
167 known HPM (>=200 mas/yr) stars: 67 in the disk and 100 in the bulge.
Multi-epoch images were provided by 2MASS and the VISTA Variables in Via Lactea
(VVV). The VVV is a new on-going ZYJHKs plus multi-epoch Ks survey of ~562
deg^2 of Milky Way's bulge and inner Southern disk.
  Seven new co-moving companions were discovered around known HPM stars; six
known co-moving pairs were recovered; a pair of stars that was thought to be
co-moving was found to have different proper motions; published HPMs of eight
stars were not confirmed; last but not least, spectral types ranging from G8V
to M5V were derived from new infrared spectroscopy for seventeen stars, members
of the co-moving pairs.
  The seven newly discovered stars constitute ~4% of the nearby HPM star list
but this is not a firm limit on the HPM star incompleteness because our
starting point--the HPM list assembled from the literature--is incomplete
itself, missing many nearby HPM M and L type objects, and it is contaminated
with non-HPM stars. We have demonstrated, that the superior sub-arcsec spatial
resolution, with respect to previous surveys, allows the VVV to examine further
the binary nature nature of known HPM stars. The >=5 yr span of VVV will
provide sufficient baseline for finding new HPM stars from VVV data alone.

Universe (BAU). In the scenario where the right electron asymmetry supports the
BAU alone through the conservation law $B/3 - L_{eR}=const$ at temperatures
$T>T_{RL}\simeq 10 TeV$ the following universe cooling leads to the production
of a non-zero left lepton (electrons and neutrinos) asymmetry. This is due to
the Higgs decays becoming more faster when entering the equilibrium at
$T=T_{RL}$ with the universe expansion, $\Gamma_{RL}\sim T> H\sim T^2$,
resulting in the parallel evolution of both the right and the left electron
asymmetries at $T<T_{RL}$ through the corresponding Abelian anomalies in SM in
the presence of a seed hypermagnetic field. The hypermagnetic helicity
evolution proceeds in a self-consistent way with the lepton asymmetry growth.
The role of sphaleron transitions decreasing the left lepton number turns out
to be negligible in given scenario. The hypermagnetic helicity can be a supply
for the magnetic one in Higgs phase assuming a strong seed hypermagnetic field
in symmetric phase.

  However, in the situation described the classic Strang splitting scheme,
while still a method of second order, is not longer symmetric. This, in turn,
implies that the construction of higher order methods by composition is limited
to order three only. To remedy this situation, based on previous work in the
context of ordinary differential equations, we construct a class of Strang
splitting schemes that are symmetric up to a desired order.
  We show rigorously that, under suitable assumptions on the nonlinearity,
these methods are of second order and can then be used to construct higher
order methods by composition. In addition, we illustrate the theoretical
results by conducting numerical experiments for the Brusselator system and the

we propose to harness sparse-representation modeling to the image patches,
adopting the same exponential idea. Our scheme uses a greedy pursuit with
boot-strapping based stopping condition and dictionary learning within the
denoising process. The reconstruction performance of the proposed scheme is
competitive with leading methods in high SNR, and achieving state-of-the-art
results in cases of low SNR.

rotating giant, and most likely constitutes an accretion-induced post-mass
transfer system similar to other PNe such as LoTr 5, WeBo 1 and A70. Such
systems represent rare opportunities to further the investigation into the
formation of barium stars and intermediate period post-AGB systems -- a
formation process still far from being understood. Here, we present the first
detailed analyses of both the central star system and the surrounding nebula of
LoTr 1 using a combination of spectra obtained with VLT-FORS2, AAT-UCLES and
NTT-EMMI, as well as SuperWASP photometry. We confirm the binary nature of the
central star of LoTr 1 that consists of a K1 III giant and a hot white dwarf.
The cool giant does not present any sign of s-process enhancement but is shown
to have a rotation period of 6.4 days, which is a possible sign of mass
accretion. LoTr 1 also presents broad double-peaked H-alpha emission lines,
whose origin is still unclear. The nebula of LoTr 1 consists in two slightly
elongated shells, with ages of 17,000 and 35,000 years, respectively, and with
different orientations. As such, LoTr 1 present a very different nebular

follows:
  (1) Spiral arms of most galaxies cannot be described by a single value of the
pitch angle. About 2/3 of galaxies demonstrate pitch angle variations exceeding
20%. In most galaxies in the sample their pitch angle decreases by increasing
the distance from the centre.
  (2) Pitch angle variations correlate with the properties of galaxies - with
the shape of the surface brightness distribution (envelope-type or truncated
disc), and with the sign of stellar disc colour gradient.
  (3) More luminous and bright bulges produce more tightly wound spiral arms,
that is in agreement with current models for spiral arms formation.

non-equilibrium morphologies. In the fluid state, the system exhibits both
liquid-liquid and gas-liquid phase separation. As the system sediments, the
phase separation significantly affects the dynamics and we explore situations
where the final state is a coexistence of up to three different phases. Solving
the dynamical equations in two-dimensions, we find that in certain situations
the final density profiles of the two species have a symmetry that is different

absorption kinematics, arguments based on the inclination and the orientation
of the absorber to the quasar line-of-sight and the distribution of metals) to
determine the direction of the gas flows in and out of these galaxies. In some

ring (WCR) in the Gulf of Mexico based on the ECCO2 global ocean simulation.
Using Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) techniques to investigate this flow
reveals a pattern of transversely intersecting LCS in the mixed layer of the
WCR which experiences consistent stretching behavior over a large region of
space and time. A detailed analysis of this flow region leads to an analytical
model velocity field which captures the essential elements that generate the
transversely intersecting LCS. The model parameters are determined from the WCR
and the resulting LCS show excellent agreement with those observed in the WCR.
The three-dimensional transport behavior which creates these structures relies
on the small radial outflow which is present in the mixed layer and is not seen
below the pycnocline, leading to a sharp change in the character of the LCS at
the bottom of the mixed layer. The flow behavior revealed by the LCS limits
fluid exchange between the WCR and the surrounding ocean, contributing to the
long life of WCRs. Further study of these structures and their associated
transport behavior may lead to further insights into the development and
persistence of such geophysical vortices as well as their transport behavior.

low metallicity Wolf-Rayet (WR) galaxies selected from the SDSS. We used the
integral field spectroscopy technique in the optical spectral range (3700-6850
AA) with PMAS attached to the CAHA 3.5 m telescope. Our statistical analysis of
the spatial distributions of O/H and N/O, as derived using the direct method or
strong-line parameters consistent with it, indicates that metallicity is
homogeneous in five out of the six analysed objects in scales of the order of
several kpc. Only in the object WR404, a gradient of metallicity is found in
the direction of the low surface brightness tail. In contrast,we found an
overabundance of N/O in spatial scales of the order of hundreds of pc
associated with or close to the positions of the WR stars in 4 out of the 6
galaxies. We exclude possible hydrodynamical causes, such as the metal-poor gas
inflow, for this local pollution by means of the analysis of the
mass-metallicity relation (MZR) and mass-nitrogen-to-oxygen relation (MNOR) for
the WR galaxies catalogued in the SDSS.

fit with models for emission from cool, optically-thick accretion disks. If
that description is correct, the low temperatures that are observed imply
accretion onto ""intermediate-mass"" black holes. Subsequent work has found that
these components may follow an inverse relationship between luminosity and
temperature, implying a non-blackbody origin for this emission. We have
re-analyzed numerous XMM-Newton spectra of extreme ULXs. Crucially,
observations wherein the source fell on a chip gap were excluded owing to their
uncertain flux calibration, and the neutral column density along the line of
sight to a given source was jointly determined by multiple spectra. The
luminosity of the soft component is found to be positively correlated with
temperature, and to be broadly consistent with L ~ T^4 in the measured band
pass, as per blackbody emission from a standard thin disk. These results are
nominally consistent with accretion onto black holes with masses above the
range currently known in Galactic X-ray binaries, though there are important
caveats. Emission from inhomogeneous or super-Eddington disks may also be
consistent with the data.

techniques,taking consistently into account the star formation history and
metallicity evolution as determined from the main sequence and red giant branch
spectroscopic observations. The only free parameter in the whole analysis is
the integrated mass loss of red giant branch stars. This is the first time that
synthetic horizontal branch models, consistent with the complex star formation
history of a galaxy, are calculated and matched to the observations. We find
that the metallicity range covered by the star formation history, as
constrained by observations, plus a simple mass loss law, enable us to cover
both the full magnitude and colour range of HB stars. In addition the number
count distribution along the observed horizontal branch, can be also
reproduced, provided that the red giant branch mass loss is mildly metallicity
dependent, with a very small dispersion at fixed metallicity. The magnitude,
metallicity and period distribution of the RR Lyrae stars are also well
reproduced. There is no excess of bright objects that require enhanced-He
models. The lack of signatures of enhanced-He stars along the horizontal branch
is consistent with the lack of the O-Na anticorrelation observed in Sculptor
and other dwarf galaxies, and confirms the intrinsic difference between Local
Group dwarf galaxies and globular cluster populations. We also compare the
brightness of the observed red giant branch bump with the synthetic
counterpart, and find a discrepancy -- the theoretical bump being brighter --
similar to what is observed in Galactic globular clusters.

Fe/MgO-based MTJs with (i) one crystalline and one rough interface and (ii)

observe an asymmetric bias dependence of TMR and a reversal of its sign at
large bias. We propose a general model to explain the bias dependence in these

distinct TMR regimes: (i) tunneling regime when the interface is modified with
layers of a different insulator and (ii) resonant regime when thin metallic
layers are inserted at the interface. We demonstrate that in the tunneling
regime negative TMR is due to the high voltage which overcomes the exchange
splitting in the electrodes, while the asymmetric bias dependence of TMR is due
to the interface transmission probabilities. In the resonant regime inversion
of TMR could happen at zero voltage depending on the alignment of the resonance
levels with the Fermi surfaces of the electrodes. Moreover, the model predicts
a regime in which TMR has different sign at positive and negative bias
suggesting possibilities of combining memory with logic functions.

required for its occurrence. Recently, this powerful framework has been
successfully exploited to study surface plasmon assisted phenomena such as
light harvesting. Here, we review the general strategy based on TO to design
plasmonic devices capable of harvesting light over a broadband spectrum and
achieving considerable field confinement and enhancement. The methodology
starts with two-dimensional (2D) cases, such as 2D metal edges, crescent-shaped
cylinders, nanowire dimers, and rough metal surfaces, and has been well
extended to fully-fledged three-dimensional (3D) situations. The largely
analytic approach gives physical insights into the processes involved and
suggests the way forward to study a wide variety of plasmonic nanostructures.

higher spin anti-de Sitter gravity in a manner that manifestly preserves the
original asymptotic W-symmetry. This is done by switching on a non-vanishing
component of the connection along the temporal (thermal) circles. We first
recall the procedure in the pure gravity case (no higher spin) where the only
""chemical potentials"" are the temperature and the chemical potential associated
with the angular momentum. We then generalize to the higher spin case. We find
that there is no tension with the W(N) or W(infinity) asymptotic algebra, which
is obviously unchanged by the introduction of the chemical potentials. Our
argument is non-perturbative.

methods from nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, dynamical systems theory and
information theory. The use of chi-square tests shows that DNA cannot be
described as a low order Markov chain of order up to $r=6$. Although detailed
balance seems to hold at the level of purine-pyrimidine notation it fails when
all four basepairs are considered, suggesting spatial asymmetry and
irreversibility. Furthermore, the block entropy does not increase linearly with
the block size, reflecting the long range nature of the correlations in the
human genomic sequences. To probe locally the spatial structure of the chain we
study the exit distances from a specific symbol, the distribution of recurrence
distances and the Hurst exponent, all of which show power law tails and long
range characteristics. These results suggest that human DNA can be viewed as a
non-equilibrium structure maintained in its state through interactions with a
constantly changing environment. Based solely on the exit distance distribution
accounting for the nonequilibrium statistics and using the Monte Carlo
rejection sampling method we construct a model DNA sequence. This method allows
to keep all long range and short range statistical characteristics of the
original sequence. The model sequence presents the same characteristic
exponents as the natural DNA but fails to capture point-to-point details.

However, it has recently been shown that the quantum noise related to the

linear amplifiers are therefore realizable. Usually nondeterministic amplifiers
rely on using single photon sources. We have, in contrast, recently proposed an
amplification scheme in which no external energy is added to the signal, but
the energy required to amplify the signal originates from the stochastic
fluctuations in the field itself. Applying our amplification scheme, we examine
the amplifier gain and the success rate as well as the properties of the output
states after successful and failed amplification processes. We also optimize
the setup to find the maximum success rates in terms of the reflectivities of
the beam splitters used in the setup. In addition, we discuss the nonidealities
related to the operation of our setup and the relation of our setup with the
previous setups.

step-by-step to obtain Einstein's geometric theory of gravity. Newton's
gravitational potential satisfies the Poisson equation. We relate the potential
to a component of the metric tensor by equating the nonrelativistic result of
the principle of stationary proper time to the Lagrangian for a classical
gravitational field. In the Poisson equation the Laplacian of the component of
the metric tensor is generalized to a cyclic linear combination of the second
derivatives of the metric tensor. In local coordinates it is a single component
of the Ricci tensor. This component of the Ricci tensor is proportional to the
mass density that is related to a single component of the energy-momentum
stress tensor and its trace. We thus obtain a single component of Einstein's
gravitational field equation in local coordinates. From the principle of
general covariance applied to a single component, we obtain all tensor
components of Einstein's gravitational field equation.

of keeping certain mechanical and thermodynamic concepts separate. A new
""mechanical"" mass density is created to be used in computing inertial
quantities, whereas the actual mass density is treated as a thermodynamic
variable. A new set of balance laws is proposed, including a mass balance
equation with a non-convective flux. The basic principles of irreversible
thermodynamics are used to obtain linear constitutive equations that are
expansions of--not only the usual affinities involving gradients of temperature
and velocity--but also the gradient of the chemical potential. Transport
coefficients are then chosen based on an elementary diffusion model, which
yields simple constitutive laws featuring just two transport parameters: one
for the longitudinal part of the motion and one for the rotational part. The
resulting formulation differs from the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations of fluid
motion. In order to highlight key similarities and differences between the two
approaches, several examples in fluid mechanics are treated in part II,
including sound propagation, light scattering, steady-state shock waves,
thermophoresis, and Poiseuille flow.

spin-dependent chemical reactions, leading to biologically observable signals,
has recently imposed itself as one of the most promising candidates for certain
species. This is thanks both to its extreme sensitivity and its capacity to
reproduce results from behavioral studies. Still, in order to gain a
directional sensitivity, an anisotropic mechanism is needed. Recent proposals
have explored the possibility that such an anisotropy is due to the
electron-nucleus hyperfine interaction. In this work we explore a different
possibility, in which the anisotropy is due to spin-orbit coupling between the
electron spin and its angular momentum. We will show how a
spin-orbit-coupling-based magnetic compass can have performances comparable
with the usually-studied nuclear-hyperfine based mechanism. Our results could
thus help researchers actively looking for candidate biological molecules which
may host magnetoreceptive functions, both to describe magnetoreception in birds
as well as to develop artificial chemical compass systems.

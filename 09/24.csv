II-VI semiconductor ZnO, triggered by promising prospects for spintronic
applications. First, ferromagnetism was predicted for dilute magnetic doping.
In comprehensive investigation of ZnO:Co thin films based on the combined
measurement of macroscopic and microscopic properties, we find no evidence for
carrier-mediated itinerant ferromagnetism. Phase-pure, crystallographically
excellent ZnO:Co is uniformly paramagnetic. Superparamagnetism arises when
phase separation or defect formation occurs, due to nanometer-sized metallic
precipitates. Other compounds like ZnO:(Li,Ni) and ZnO:Cu do not exhibit
indication of ferromagnetism.
  Second, its small spin-orbit coupling and correspondingly large spin
coherence length makes ZnO suitable for transporting or manipulating spins in
spintronic devices. From optical pump/optical probe experiments, we find a spin
dephasing time of the order of 15 ns at low temperatures which we attribute to
electrons bound to Al donors. In all-electrical magnetotransport measurements,
we successfully create and detect a spin-polarized ensemble of electrons and
transport this spin information across several nanometers. We derive a spin
lifetime of 2.6 ns for these itinerant spins at low temperatures, corresponding
well to results from an electrical pump/optical probe experiment.

towed in a viscous fluid as a canonical model of nonlinear fluid structure
interactions with possible applications in the design of sensors and energy
extraction devices. First, the self-excited ellipse system is shown to be
analogous to the forced bistable oscillators studied in classic chaos theory. A
single variable, the distance between the pivot and the centroid, governs the
system bifurcation into bi-stability. Next, fully coupled computational fluid
dynamics simulations of the motion of the cylinder demonstrate limit cycle,
period doubling, intermittently chaotic, and fully chaotic dynamics as the
distance is further adjusted. The viscous wake behind the cylinder is presented
for the limit cycle cases and new types of stable wakes are characterized for
each. In contrast, a chaotic case demonstrates an independence of the wake and
structural states. The rotational kinetic energy is quantified and correlated
to the vortex shedding and the trajectory periodicity. Chaotic and high-period
system responses are found to persist when structural damping is applied and
for Reynolds numbers as low as 200.

of viable flux configurations for a metabolic network as a high-dimensional
polytope defined by the linear constraints that enforce the balancing of
production and consumption fluxes for each chemical species in the system. In
some cases, the complexity of the solution space can be reduced by performing
an additional optimization, while in other cases, knowing the range of
variability of fluxes over the polytope provides a sufficient characterization
of the allowed configurations. There are cases, however, in which the thorough
information encoded in the individual distributions of viable fluxes over the
polytope is required. Obtaining such distributions is known to be a highly
challenging computational task when the dimensionality of the polytope is
sufficiently large, and the problem of developing cost-effective {\it ad hoc}
algorithms has recently seen a major surge of interest. Here, we propose a
method that allows us to perform the required computation heuristically in a
time scaling {\it linearly} with the number of reactions in the network,
overcoming some limitations of similar techniques employed in recent years. As
a case study, we apply it to the analysis of the human red blood cell metabolic
network, whose solution space can be sampled by different exact techniques,
like Hit-and-Run Monte Carlo (scaling roughly like the third power of the
system size). Remarkably accurate estimates for the true distributions of
viable reaction fluxes are obtained, suggesting that, although further
improvements are desirable, our method enhances our ability to analyze the

However, the spectrum of the variability on these timescales correlated with
the 4-10 keV lightcurve contains only the power law. Together these show that
there is fast variability of the soft excess which is independent of the 4-10
keV variability. This is inconsistent with a single reflection component making
the soft X-ray excess as this necessarily produces correlated variability in

theories with a U(1)_R symmetry in four dimensions, M must be a complex
manifold with a Hermitian metric. We find that Z_M is independent of the metric
and depends holomorphically on the complex structure moduli. Background gauge
fields define holomorphic vector bundles over M and Z_M is a holomorphic
function of the corresponding bundle moduli. We also carry out a parallel
analysis for three-dimensional N=2 theories with a U(1)_R symmetry, where the
necessary geometric structure on M is a transversely holomorphic foliation
(THF) with a transversely Hermitian metric. Again, we find that Z_M is

We discuss several applications, including manifolds diffeomorphic to S^3 x S^1

1500 after explosion. We consider stellar progenitors with initial mass of 12,
15, 19 and 25 Msun that explode as supernovae with stratified ejecta. The
molecular precursors to dust grains comprise molecular chains, rings and small
clusters of silica, silicates, metal oxides, sulphides and carbides, pure
metals, and carbon, where the nucleation of silicate clusters is described by a
two-step process of metal and oxygen addition. We study the impact of the 56Ni
mass on the type and amount of synthesised dust. We predict that large masses
of molecules including CO, SiO, SiS, O2, and SO form in the ejecta. We show
that the discrepancy between the small dust masses detected at infrared
wavelengths some 500 days post-explosion and the larger amounts of dust
recently detected with Herschel in supernova remnants can be explained by the
non-equilibrium chemistry linked to the formation of molecules and dust
clusters in the ejected material. Dust gradually builds up from small (~10^{-5}
Msun) to large masses (~5x 10^{-2} Msun) over a 5 yr period after explosion.
Subsequent dust formation and/or growth is hampered by the shortage of chemical
agents participating in the dust nucleation and the long time scale for
accretion. The results highlight the dependence of the dust chemical
composition and mass on the amount of 56Ni synthesised during the explosion.
This dependence may partly explain the diversity of epochs at which dust forms
in supernovae. More generally, our results indicate that type II-P supernovae
are efficient but moderate dust producers with an upper limit on the mass of
synthesised dust ranging from ~ 0.03 to 0.09 Msun.

integrals. This result easily implies the tropical analogue of the mirror
symmetry statement mentioned above and, using the necessary Correspondence
Theorem, also the mirror symmetry statement itself. In this way, our tropical
generalization leads to an alternative proof of mirror symmetry for elliptic

carries the potential of being generalized to more adventurous situations of

involved invariants are easy to compute. Furthermore, we can use the techniques
for computing Feynman integrals to prove that they are quasimodular forms.
Also, as a side product, we can give a combinatorial characterization of
Feynman graphs for which the corresponding integrals are zero. More generally,
the tropical mirror symmetry theorem gives a natural interpretation of the
A-model side (i.e., the generating function of Gromov-Witten invariants) in
terms of a sum over Feynman graphs. Hence our quasimodularity result becomes
meaningful on the A-model side as well. Our theoretical results are

shows (nearly) optimal drifting regret bounds only for the $\ell_2$ and the

Online Mirror Descent ($\omd$) updates; one key insight that results from our
work is that in order for these algorithms to succeed, it suffices to have the
gradient of the regularizer to be bounded (in an appropriate norm). For
situations (like for the $\ell_1$ norm) where the vanilla regularizer does not
have this property, we have to {\em shift} the regularizer to ensure this.
Thus, this helps explain the various updates presented in \cite{bansal10,

pose a conjecture analogous to the $\mathbf{VP}$ vs. $\mathbf{VNP}$ conjecture
in the classical case. In the second part of the paper we extend the notions of
complexity classes to sequences of constructible sheaves over $\mathbb{R}^n$
(or its one point compactification). We introduce a class of sequences of
simple constructible sheaves, that could be seen as the sheaf-theoretic analog
of the Blum-Shub-Smale class $\mathbf{P}_{\mathbb{R}}$. We also define a
hierarchy of complexity classes of sheaves mirroring the polynomial hierarchy,
$\mathbf{PH}_{\mathbb{R}}$, in the B-S-S theory. We prove a singly exponential
upper bound on the topological complexity of the sheaves in this hierarchy
mirroring a similar result in the B-S-S setting. We obtain as a result an
algorithm with singly exponential complexity for a sheaf-theoretic variant of
the real quantifier elimination problem. We pose the natural sheaf-theoretic
analogs of the classical $\mathbf{P}$ vs. $\mathbf{NP}$ question, and also
discuss a connection with Toda's theorem from discrete complexity theory in the
context of constructible sheaves. We also discuss possible generalizations of
the questions in complexity theory related to separation of complexity classes
to more general categories via sequences of adjoint pairs of functors.

strong spatial similarities between many frequently reported task-negative
brain networks, which are often termed the default mode network. The default
mode network is typically assumed to be a spatially-fixed network; however,
when defined by task-induced deactivation, its spatial distribution it varies
depending on what specific task is being performed. Many studies have revealed
a strong temporal relationship between task-positive and task-negative networks
that are important for efficient cognitive functioning and here. Here, using
data from four different cognitive tasks taken from two independent datasets,
we test the hypothesis that there is also a fundamental spatial relationship
between them. Specifically, it is hypothesized that the distance between task
positive and negative-voxels is preserved despite different spatial patterns of
activation and deactivation being evoked by different cognitive tasks. Here, we
show that there is lower variability in the distance between task-positive and
task-negative voxels across four different sensory, motor and cognitive tasks
than would be expected by chance - implying that deactivation patterns are
spatially dependent on activation patterns (and vice versa) and that both are
modulated by specific task demands. We propose that this spatial relationship
may be the macroscopic analogue of microscopic neuronal organization reported
in sensory cortical systems, and we speculate why this spatial organization may
be important for efficient sensorimotor and cognitive functioning.

when the size of the large matrix $p\to\infty$, if the submatrix size

constraints can incur a severe penalty on the statistical performance in the
sense that any randomized polynomial-time test is minimax suboptimal by a

kinematics of molecular clouds. Our analysis is based on recent observational
measurements and data from a suite of six simulations of the interstellar
medium, including effects of self-gravity, turbulence, magnetic field, and
multiphase thermodynamics. Simulations of isothermal supersonic turbulence
reproduce observed slopes in linewidth-size and mass-size relations. Whether or
not self-gravity is included, the linewidth-size relation remains the same. The
mass-size relation, instead, substantially flattens below the sonic scale, as
prestellar cores start to form. Our multiphase models with magnetic field and
domain size 200 pc reproduce both scaling and normalization of the first Larson
law. The simulations support a turbulent interpretation of Larson's relations.
This interpretation implies that: (i) the slopes of linewidth-size and
mass-size correlations are determined by the inertial cascade; (ii) none of the
three Larson laws is fundamental; (iii) instead, if one is known, the other two
follow from scale invariance of the kinetic energy transfer rate. It does not
imply that gravity is dynamically unimportant. The self-similarity of structure
established by the turbulence breaks in star-forming clouds due to the
development of gravitational instability in the vicinity of the sonic scale.
The instability leads to the formation of prestellar cores with the
characteristic mass set by the sonic scale. The high-end slope of the core mass
function predicted by the scaling relations is consistent with the Salpeter
power-law index.

main finding is that the size of the dag of the binary tree can never be

examples that match this bound. We introduce a new combined structure, the
hybrid dag, which is guaranteed to be smaller than (or equal in size to) both

network and rapidly diversifying effector and recognition components, often
containing a high proportion of taxonomically-restricted genes. In the absence
of functional annotation, genes encoding immune system proteins can thus be
difficult to identify, as homology-based approaches generally cannot detect
lineage-specific genes. Here, we use RNA-seq to compare the uninfected and
infection-induced transcriptome in the parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis to
identify genes regulated by infection. We identify 183 genes significantly
up-regulated by infection and 61 genes significantly down-regulated by

vitripennis, and show that most infection-induced genes are not assigned an
immune function from homology alone, suggesting the potential for substantial
novel immune components in less-well-studied systems. Finally, we show that a
high proportion of these novel induced genes are taxonomically-restricted,

functional annotation using RNA-seq and homology-based annotation provides a
robust method to characterize the innate immune response across a wide variety
of insects, and reveals significant novel features of the Nasonia immune
response.

Padua library of isochrones (Bertelli et al. 1994). The major revision involves
the thermally pulsing AGB phase, that is now taken from fully evolutionary
calculations by Weiss & Ferguson (2009). Two libraries of about 600 AGB
dust-enshrouded SEDs each have also been calculated, one for oxygen-rich
M-stars and one for carbon-rich C-stars. Each library accounts for different
values of input parameters like the optical depth {\tau}, dust composition, and
temperature of the inner boundary of the dust shell. These libraries of dusty
AGB spectra have been implemented into a large composite library of theoretical
stellar spectra, to cover all regions of the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram (HRD)
crossed by the isochrones. With the aid of the above isochrones and libraries
of stellar SEDs, we have calculated the spectro-photometric properties (SEDs,
magnitudes, and colours) of single-generation stellar populations (SSPs) for
six metallicities, more than fifty ages (from 3 Myr to 15 Gyr), and nine
choices of the Initial Mass Function. The new isochrones and SSPs have been
compared to the colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of field populations in the
LMC and SMC, with particular emphasis on AGB stars, and the integrated colours
of star clusters in the same galaxies, using data from the SAGE (Surveying the
Agents of Galaxy Evolution) catalogues. We have also examined the integrated
colours of a small sample of star clusters located in the outskirts of M31. The
agreement between theory and observations is generally good. In particular, the
new SSPs reproduce the red tails of the AGB star distribution in the CMDs of

Hodgkin-Huxley model of the axon, that the density redistribution of

up to its spontaneous initiation. At the significant redistribution of sodium
channels in membrane, the rarefaction zones of the transmembrane channels

obtained in this way, with different interactions and matter content (chiral

three-branes and fractional branes probing orbifold singularities. The duality
sheds light on the dynamics of gauge theories and their possible infrared
phases by providing concrete magnetic dual descriptions of strongly coupled
theories. Some of the models share various properties with QCD, including
confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. More generally, these theories
feature fermions in multiple two-index representations and could realize
intriguing phases such as a free magnetic phase with chiral symmetry breaking

total), 22 AGN and 423 stars, observed by instruments such as DEIMOS, VIMOS and
GMOS, in 3 fields containing 5 quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) with HST UV
spectroscopy. We also present a new spectroscopic survey of 165 'strong' (10^14
< NHI < 10^17 cm^-2), and 489 'weak' (10^13 < NHI < 10^14 cm^-2) intervening HI
absorption line systems at z < 1 (654 in total), observed in the spectra of 8
QSOs by COS and FOS on the HST. Combining these new data with previously
published galaxy catalogs such as VVDS and GDDS, we have gathered a sample of
654 HI absorption systems and 17509 galaxies at transverse scales < 50 Mpc. We
present observational results on the HI-galaxy and galaxy-galaxy correlations
at transverse scales r < 10 Mpc, and the HI-HI auto-correlation at transverse
scales r < 2 Mpc. The two-point correlation functions are measured both along
and transverse to the line-of-sight. We constrain the HI-galaxy statistical
connection, as a function of both HI column density and galaxy star-forming
activity. Our results are consistent with the following conclusions: (1) the
bulk of HI systems on Mpc scales have little velocity dispersion (<120 km/s)
with respect to the bulk of galaxies; (2) the vast majority of strong HI
systems and SF galaxies are distributed in the same locations, together with
75+-15% of non-SF galaxies, all of which typically reside in dark matter haloes
of similar masses; (3) 25+-15% of non-SF galaxies reside in galaxy clusters and
are not correlated with strong HI systems at scales < 2 Mpc; and (4) 50% of
weak HI systems reside within galaxy voids (hence not correlated with
galaxies), and are confined in dark matter haloes of masses smaller than those

trace the dynamical state of circumgalactic gas, using cosmological
hydrodynamic simulations that include a well-vetted heuristic model for
galactic outflows. We categorize inflowing, outflowing, and ambient gas based
on its history and fate as tracked in our simulation. Following our earlier
work showing that the ionisation level of absorbers was a primary factor in
determining the physical conditions of absorbing gas, we show here that it is
also a governing factor for its dynamical state. Low-ionisation metal absorbers
(e.g. MgII) tend to arise in gas that will fall onto galaxies within several
Gyr, while high-ionisation metal absorbers (e.g. OVI) generally trace material
that was deposited by outflows many Gyr ago. Inflowing gas is dominated by
enriched material that was previously ejected in an outflow, hence accretion at
low redshifts is typically substantially enriched. Recycling wind material is
preferentially found closer to galaxies, and is more dominant in lower-mass
halos since high-mass halos have more hot gas that is able to support itself
against infall. Low-mass halos also tend to re-eject more of their accreted
material, owing to our outflow prescription that employs higher mass loading
factors for lower-mass galaxies. Typical HI absorbers trace unenriched ambient
material that is not participating in the baryon cycle, but stronger HI
absorbers arise in cool, enriched inflowing gas. Instantaneous radial velocity
measures of absorbers are generally poor at distinguishing between inflowing
and outflowing gas, except in the case of very recent outflows. These results
suggest that probing halo gas using a range of absorbers can provide detailed
information about the amount and physical conditions of material that is
participating in the baryon cycle.

with PdBI and we combine these with 33GHz JVLA data and our previous 12CO and
continuum emission information to better constrain the properties of the ISM

decomposed properties of the galaxy and coupled with an LVG model we find that
the star-forming regions in the system vary in their cold gas properties. We
find strong C18O emission both in the velocity-integrated emission and in the
two kinematic components at the periphery of the system, where the C18O line
flux is equivalent to or higher than the 13CO. We derive an average
velocity-integrated flux ratio of 13CO/C18O~1 suggesting a [13CO]/[C18O]
abundance ratio at least 7x lower than that in the Milky Way. This may suggest
enhanced C18O abundance, perhaps indicating star formation preferentially
biased to high-mass stars. We estimate the relative contribution to the ISM
heating from cosmic rays and UV of (30-3300)x10^(-25)erg/s and 45x10^(-25)erg/s
per H2 molecule respectively and both are comparable to the total cooling rate
of (0.8-20)x10^(-25)erg/s from the CO. However, our LVG models indicate high
(>100K) temperatures and densities (>10^(3))cm^(-3) in the ISM which may
suggest that cosmic rays play a more important role than UV heating in this
system. If cosmic rays dominate the heating of the ISM, the increased
temperature in the star forming regions may favour the formation of massive
stars and so explain the enhanced C18O abundance. This is a potentially
important result for a system which may evolve into a local elliptical galaxy.

over time. However, stellar winds of solar analogs are poorly constrained due
to the challenges in observing them. A great improvement has been made in the
last decade in our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the
acceleration of the solar wind and in the development of numerical models for
solar and stellar winds. In this paper, we present a grid of
Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models to study and quantify the values of stellar
mass-loss and angular momentum loss rates as a function of the stellar rotation
period, magnetic dipole component, and coronal base density. We derive simple
scaling laws for the loss rates as a function of these parameters, and
constrain the possible mass-loss rate of stars with thermally-driven winds.
Despite the success of our scaling law in matching the results of the model, we
find a deviation between the ""solar dipole"" case and a real case based on solar
observations that overestimates the actual solar mass-loss rate by a factor of
3. This implies that the model for stellar fields might require a further
investigation with higher complexity which might include the use of a filling
factor for active regions, as well as the distribution of the strength of the
small-scale fields. Mass loss rates in general are largely controlled by the
magnetic field strength, with the wind density varying in proportion to the
confining magnetic pressure $B^2$. We also find that the mass-loss rates
obtained using our grid models drop much faster with the increase in rotation
period than scaling laws derived using observed stellar activity. For
main-sequence solar-like stars, our scaling law for angular momentum loss vs.
poloidal magnetic field strength retrieves the well-known Skumanich decline of
angular velocity with time.

was a normal, albeit massive (M ~10^{11} solar masses), star-forming galaxy.
The optical stellar disc of the host galaxy is smooth and well described by a
S\'ersic profile, which argues against a recent major merger, however there is
also a point-source component which may be the remnant of a minor merger. The
half-light radius of the optical disc is constrained to lie in the range 3.5 to
8.2kpc, which is of similar size to coeval star forming galaxies.
  Biconical shells of nebular emission and UV-bright continuum extend out from
the host galaxy along the radio jet axis, which is also the minor axis of the
host galaxy. The origin of the continuum emission is uncertain, but it is most
likely to be young stars or dust-scattered light from the AGN, and it is
possible that stars are forming from this material at a rate of
200^{+1420}_{-110} solar masses per year.

the capacity of future surveys to rule out the LCDM model. It is based on a
measure of the difference in volume of observable space that the future surveys
will constrain with and without imposing the model. This model breaking figure
of merit is easy to compute and can lead to different survey optimizations than
other metrics. We illustrate its impact using a simple combination of

atmospheres, the geometric albedo and the incident stellar flux do not exhibit
a clear correlation, as revealed by our re-analysis of Q0 to Q14 Kepler data.
If the albedo is primarily associated with the presence of clouds in these
irradiated atmospheres, a holistic modeling approach needs to relate the
following properties: the strength of stellar irradiation (and hence the
strength and depth of atmospheric circulation), the geometric albedo (which
controls both the fraction of starlight absorbed and the pressure level at
which it is predominantly absorbed) and the properties of the embedded cloud
particles (which determine the albedo). The anticipated diversity in cloud
properties renders any correlation between the geometric albedo and the stellar
flux to be weak and characterized by considerable scatter. In the limit of
vertically uniform populations of scatterers and absorbers, we use an
analytical model and scaling relations to relate the temperature-pressure
profile of an irradiated atmosphere and the photon deposition layer and to
estimate if a cloud particle will be lofted by atmospheric circulation. We
derive an analytical formula for computing the albedo spectrum in terms of the
cloud properties, which we compare to the measured albedo spectrum of HD
189733b by Evans et al. (2013). Furthermore, we show that whether an optical
phase curve is flat or sinusoidal depends on whether the particles are small or
large as defined by the Knudsen number. This may be an explanation for why
Kepler-7b exhibits evidence for the longitudinal variation in abundance of
condensates, while Kepler-12b shows no evidence for the presence of
condensates, despite the incident stellar flux being similar for both

spontaneously broken in the SUSY-breaking sector. The breaking is then
dynamically mediated to the visible sector and is manifested via
non-renormalizable operators at low energy. Consequently, RPV operators
originate from the Kahler potential rather than the superpotential, and are
naturally suppressed by the SUSY-breaking scale, explaining their small
magnitudes. A new set of non-holomorphic RPV operators are identified and found
to often dominate over the standard RPV ones. We study the relevant low-energy
constraints arising from baryon-number violating processes, proton decay and
flavor changing neutral currents, which may all be satisfied if a solution to
the Standard Model flavor puzzle is incorporated. The chiral structure of the

extend our earlier results to show that torque-limited growth yields black
holes and host galaxies evolving on average along the Mbh-Mbulge relation from
early times down to z = 0 and that convergence onto the scaling relation occurs
independent of the initial conditions and with no need for mass averaging
through mergers or additional self-regulation processes. Smooth accretion
dominates the long-term evolution, with black hole mergers with mass ratios
>1:5 representing typically a small fraction of the total growth. Winds from
the accretion disk are required to eject significant mass to suppress black
hole growth, but there is no need for coupling this wind to galactic-scale gas
to regulate black holes in a non-linear feedback loop. Torque-limited growth
yields a close-to-linear relation for the star formation rate and the black
hole accretion rate averaged over galaxy evolution time scales. However, the
SFR-AGN connection has significant scatter owing to strong variability of black
hole accretion at all resolved time scales. Eddington ratios can be described
by a broad lognormal distribution with median value evolving roughly as (1 +
z)^1.9, suggesting a main sequence for black hole growth similar to the cosmic
evolution of specific SFRs. Our results offer an attractive scenario consistent
with available observations in which cosmological gas infall and transport of
angular momentum in the galaxy by gravitational instabilities regulate the
long-term co-evolution of black holes and star-forming galaxies.

possible through deep medium-bandwidth imaging at 1-2um . We combine this with
HST imaging from the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey
(CANDELS), allowing for the efficient selection of both blue and red galaxies
down to stellar masses ~10^9.5 Msol at z ~ 2.5. The total surveyed area is 316
arcmin^2 distributed over three independent fields. We supplement these data
with the wider and shallower NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey (NMBS) to provide
stronger constraints at high masses. Several studies at z<=1 have revealed a
steepening of the slope at the low-mass end of the stellar mass function (SMF),
leading to an upturn at masses <10^10 Msol that is not well-described by a
standard single-Schechter function. We find evidence that this feature extends
to at least z ~ 2, and that it can be found in both the star-forming and
quiescent populations individually. The characteristic mass (M*) and slope at
the lowest masses (alpha) of a double-Schechter function fit to the SMF stay
roughly constant at Log(M/Msol) ~ 10.65 and ~-1.5 respectively. The SMF of
star-forming galaxies has evolved primarily in normalization, while the change
in shape is relatively minor. This is not the case for quiescent galaxies: the
depth of our imaging allows us to show for the first time significantly more
evolution at Log(M/Msol) < 10.5 than at higher masses. We find that the total

factor of ~2.2 since z ~ 2.5, whereas in quiescent galaxies it has increased by
a factor of ~12 .

density of $3.5\times10^{22}$ \cmsq\ assuming neutral absorption. We
incorporate SDSS optical measurements (rest frame UV) to study the broadband
spectral index between the X-ray and UV bands, and compare this to a large
sample of normal quasars. We estimate that the optically-faint BALQSOs are
X-ray weaker than the optically-bright ones, and the entire sample of BALQSOs
are intrinsically X-ray weak when compared to normal AGN. Correcting for
magnification of X-ray emission via gravitational lensing by the central black
hole viewed at large inclination angles makes these BALQSOs even more

efficiencies of a few percent for an X-ray wind of $0.3c$ in high-ionization

heat at low temperatures. These deviations are often attributed to two-level
systems of uncertain origin. We find that a source of excess specific heat
comes from correlations between quanta of energy if phonon-like excitations are
localized on an intermediate length scale. We use simulations of a simplified
Creutz model for a system of Ising-like spins coupled to a thermal bath of
Einstein-like oscillators. One feature of this model is that energy is
quantized in both the system and its bath, ensuring conservation of energy at
every step. Another feature is that the exact entropies of both the system and
its bath are known at every step, so that their temperatures can be determined
independently. We find that there is a mismatch in canonical temperature
between the system and its bath. In addition to the usual finite-size effects
in the Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac distributions, if excitations in the heat
bath are localized on an intermediate length scale, this mismatch is
independent of system size up to at least 10^6 particles. We use a model for
correlations between quanta of energy to adjust the statistical distributions
and yield a thermodynamically consistent temperature. The model includes a
chemical potential for units of energy, as is often used for other types of
particles that are quantized and conserved. Experimental evidence for this
model comes from its ability to characterize the excess specific heat of
imperfect crystals at low temperatures.

isolated ordinary pulsar population detected by the Fermi gamma-ray space
telescope. We compared the model expectations of four emission models and the
LAT data. We found that all the models fail to reproduce the LAT detections, in
particular the large number of high spin-down power objects observed. This
inconsistency is not model dependent. A discrepancy between the
radio-loud/radio-quiet objects ratio was also found between the observed and
predicted samples. The gamma-ray luminosity proportional to the 0.5 power of
the spin-down power relation is robustly confirmed by all the assumed models
with particular agreement in the slot gap (SG) case. On luminosity bases, the
intermediate altitude emission of the two pole caustic SG model is favoured.
The beaming factor shows an spin-down power dependency that is slightly visible
in theSG case. Estimates of the pulsar orientations have been obtained to
explain the simultaneous gamma and radio light-curves. By analysing the
solutions we found a relation between the observed energy cutoff and the width
of the emission slot gap. This relation has been theoretically predicted. A
possible magnetic obliquity alignment with time is rejected -for all the
models- on timescale of the order of a million years. The light-curve
morphology study shows that the outer magnetosphere gap emission are favoured
to explain the observed radio-gamma lag. The light curve moment studies
(symmetry and sharpness) on the contrary favour a two pole caustic slot gap
emission. All the model predictions suggest a different magnetic field layout
with an hybrid two pole caustic and intermediate altitude emission to explain
both the pulsar luminosity and light curve morphology . The low magnetosphere
emission mechanism of the polar cap model, is systematically rejected by all
the tests done.

AM1219A is about 3.8 times brighter than the secondary (AM1219B). The surface
brightness profile of AM1219A was decomposed into bulge and disc components.
The profile shows a light excess of ~ 53 % due to the contribution of
star-forming regions, which is typical of starburst galaxies. On the other
hand, the surface brightness profile of AM1219B shows a lens structure in
addition to the bulge and disc. The scale lengths and central magnitudes of the

  version",,,,"hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Localised sources such as D-branes or orientifold planes play an important
role in many string compactifications that are relevant for phenomenology. The
presence of these objects typically induces complicated dynamics in the compact
dimensions such that a full solution to the 10d equations of motion is often
out of reach. In order to still be able to make statements about the 4d
effective theory arising in the low-energy limit, the equations of motion are
usually only solved in an integrated sense, while the backreaction of the
localised sources on the internal fields is neglected. This simplification is
often referred to as smearing. In this work, we investigate to what extent
smearing may affect observables in the effective low-energy theory and whether
it may lead to fake solutions that would cease to exist once the backreaction
is properly taken into account. We analyse explicit examples for which smeared
solutions exist and find that the reliability of the smeared approximation
appears to depend on whether or not these solutions saturate a BPS bound. We
also address the proposal of placing anti-D3-branes at the tip of a warped
throat geometry like the Klebanov-Strassler solution in order to construct
meta-stable de Sitter vacua in string theory. We show that, under a few general
assumptions, the backreaction of the fully localised anti-branes yields a
singularity in fields that do not directly couple to them, and we give an
argument suggesting that the singularity is not resolved by brane polarisation.
We furthermore demonstrate that, in many string compactifications involving
non-trivial background fluxes, the effective lower-dimensional cosmological
constant is determined by the on-shell action of the localised sources present
in the solution. This often allows to compute the cosmological constant without
resorting to potentially unreliable approximations like smearing.

has been paid to the analysis of urban structure (especially commuting pattern)
using smart card data (SCD), which are widely available in most cities.
Additionally, ubiquitous LBS data, although providing rich spatial and temporal
information, lacks rich information on the social dimension, which limits its
in-depth application. To bridge this gap, this paper combines bus SCD for a
one-week period with a one-day household travel survey, as well as a
parcel-level land use map to identify job-housing locations and commuting trip
routes in Beijing. Two data forms (TRIP and PTD) are proposed, with PTD used
for jobs-housing identification and TRIP used for commuting trip route
identification. The results of the identification are aggregated in the bus
stop and traffic analysis zone (TAZ) scales, respectively. Particularly,
commuting trips from three typical residential communities to six main business
zones are mapped and compared to analyze commuting patterns in Beijing. The
identified commuting trips are validated on three levels by comparison with
those from the survey in terms of commuting time and distance, and the positive
validation results prove the applicability of our approach. Our experiment, as
a first step toward enriching LBS data using conventional survey and urban GIS
data, can obtain solid identification results based on rules extracted from
existing surveys or censuses.

numerical implementation relies on a massively parallel evaluation of the
self-energy and the Green's function at each lattice site, employing thousands
of CPUs. While the computation of the self-energy is straightforward to
parallelize, the evaluation of the Green's function requires the inversion of a
large sparse $10^d\times 10^d$ matrix, with $d > 6$. As a crucial ingredient,
our solution heavily relies on the smallness of the hopping as compared to the
interaction strength and yields a widely scalable realization of a rapidly
converging iterative algorithm which evaluates all elements of the Green's
function. Results are validated by comparing with the homogeneous case via the
local-density approximation. These calculations also show that the

building a confidence region from the observed data such that its border

  This correspondence allows us to state and prove the POVM version of
classical results from the local theory of Banach spaces about the
approximation of zonoids by zonotopes. We show that on $\mathbf{C}^d$, the
uniform POVM (the most symmetric POVM) can be sparsified, i.e. approximated by
a discrete POVM, the latter having only $O(d^2)$ outcomes. We also show that
similar (but weaker) approximation results actually hold for any POVM on
$\mathbf{C}^d$.
  By defining an appropriate notion of tensor product for zonoids, we are then
able to extend our results to the multipartite setting: we show, roughly
speaking, that local POVMs may be sparsified locally. In particular, the local
uniform POVM on $\mathbf{C}^{d_1}\otimes\cdots\otimes\mathbf{C}^{d_k}$ can be
approximated by a discrete POVM which is local and has
$O(d_1^2\times\cdots\times d_k^2)$ outcomes.

range rate measurements from the target, which may be corrupted by additive

globally smooth and bounded. Exploiting the relationship between range rate and
bearing angle, we transform the system dynamics from Cartesian coordinate in
terms of location and heading to polar coordinate in terms of range and bearing

differential equation. A recurrence result is established showing that the UAV
will reach a neighborhood of the desired orbit in finite time. Some statistical
measures of performance are obtained to support the technical analysis.

propose NH3 as a biosignature gas on a ""cold Haber World,"" a planet with a

large of a biomass to be a plausible biosignature gas on planets with Earth or
early-Earth-like atmospheres orbiting a Sun-like star. To construct the biomass
models, we developed a functional classification of biosignature gases, and
found that gases (such as CH4, H2S, and N2O) produced from life that extracts
energy from chemical potential energy gradients will always have false
positives because geochemistry has the same gases to work with as life does,
and gases (such as DMS and CH3Cl) produced for secondary metabolic reasons are
far less likely to have false positives but because of their highly specialized
origin are more likely to be produced in small quantities. The biomass model
estimates are valid to one or two orders of magnitude; the goal is an
independent approach to testing whether a biosignature gas is plausible rather
than a precise quantification of atmospheric biosignature gases and their

biomass estimate framework for evaluating the plausibilty of a range of

the most abundant reactive species in H2 atmospheres. In atmospheres with high
CO2 levels, atomic O is the major destructive species for some molecules. In
sun-Earth-like UV radiation environments, H (and in some cases O) will rapidly
destroy nearly all biosignature gases of interest. The lower UV fluxes from UV
quiet M stars would produce a lower concentration of H (or O) for the same
scenario, enabling some biosignature gases to accumulate. The favorability of
low-UV radiation environments to in an H2 atmosphere is closely analogous to
the case of oxidized atmospheres, where photochemically produced OH is the
major destructive species. Most potential biosignature gases, such as DMS and
CH3Cl are therefore more favorable in low UV, as compared to solar-like UV,
environments. A few promising biosignature gas candidates, including NH3 and
N2O, are favorable even in solar-like UV environments, as these gases are
destroyed directly by photolysis and not by H (or O). A more subtle finding is
that most gases produced by life that are fully hydrogenated forms of an
element, such as CH4, H2S, are not effective signs of life in an H2-rich

abiologically, through photochemistry or geochemistry. Suitable biosignature

carriers, and local moments on its surface, can be directly manipulated and
controlled with electrostatic potentials. We first consider bilayer graphene
subject to a spatially varying electrostatic potential that forms two
neighbouring regions with opposite interlayer bias. Along the boundary, 1D
chiral ""kink"" states emerge. We find that these 1D modes behave as a strongly
interacting Luttinger liquid whose properties can be tuned via an external
gate. Next, we consider superlattices in bilayer graphene. Superlattices are
seen to have a more dramatic effect on bilayer graphene than monolayer graphene
because the quasi-particles are changed in a fundamental way; the dispersion
goes from a quadratic band touching point to linearly dispersing Dirac cones.
We illustrate that a 1D superlattice of either the chemical potential or an
interlayer bias generates multiple anisotropic Dirac cones. General arguments
delineate how certain symmetries protect the Dirac points. We then map the
Hamiltonian of an interlayer bias superlattice onto a chain model comprised of
""topological"" modes. This is followed by another study that considers the
effect of a magnetic field on graphene superlattices. We show that
magnetotransport measurements in a weak perpendicular magnetic field probe the
number of emergent Dirac points and reveal details about the dispersion. In the
case of bilayer graphene, we also discuss the properties of kink states in an
applied magnetic field. Finally, we investigate local moment formation of
adatoms on bilayer graphene using an Anderson impurity model. We identify
regions where the local moments can be turned on or off by applying a external
electric fields. In addition, we compute the RKKY interaction between local
moments and show how it too can be controlled with electric fields.

among variables in a wide range of applications, has attracted great attention
in recent years. This paper considers a fundamental question: When is it
possible to estimate low-dimensional parameters at parametric square-root rate
in a large Gaussian graphical model? A novel regression approach is proposed to
obtain asymptotically efficient estimation of each entry of a precision matrix
under a sparseness condition relative to the sample size. When the precision
matrix is not sufficiently sparse, or equivalently the sample size is not
sufficiently large, a lower bound is established to show that it is no longer
possible to achieve the parametric rate in the estimation of each entry. This
lower bound result, which provides an answer to the delicate sample size
question, is established with a novel construction of a subset of sparse
precision matrices in an application of Le Cam's lemma. Moreover, the proposed
estimator is proven to have optimal convergence rate when the parametric rate
cannot be achieved, under a minimal sample requirement. The proposed estimator
is applied to test the presence of an edge in the Gaussian graphical model or
to recover the support of the entire model, to obtain adaptive rate-optimal
estimation of the entire precision matrix as measured by the matrix $\ell_q$
operator norm and to make inference in latent variables in the graphical model.
All of this is achieved under a sparsity condition on the precision matrix and
a side condition on the range of its spectrum. This significantly relaxes the
commonly imposed uniform signal strength condition on the precision matrix,
irrepresentability condition on the Hessian tensor operator of the covariance
matrix or the $\ell_1$ constraint on the precision matrix. Numerical results
confirm our theoretical findings. The ROC curve of the proposed algorithm,
Asymptotic Normal Thresholding (ANT), for support recovery significantly

(J=1-0) taken from the Galactic Ring Survey (GRS) and neutral hydrogen (HI)
data from the Southern Galactic Plane Survey (SGPS) have been used in
combination with new 1420 MHz radio continuum observations carried out with the
Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT). Results: From the new observations and
analysis of archival data we provided for the first time a reliable estimate
for the distance to the SNR G15.4+0.1 and discovered molecular clouds located
at the same distance. On the basis of HI absorption features, we estimate the
distance to G15.4+0.1 in 4.8+/-1.0 kpc. The 13CO observations clearly show a
molecular cloud about 5 arcmin in size with two bright clumps, labeled A and B,
clump A positionally associated with the location of HESS J1818-154 and clump B
in coincidence with the brightest northern border of the radio SNR shell. The
HI absorption and the 13CO emission study indicates a possible interaction
between the molecular material and the remnant. We estimate the masses and
densities of the molecular gas as (1.2+/-0.5)X10^3 M_sun and (1.5+/-0.4)X10^3
cm^-3 for clump A and (3.0+/-0.7)X10^3 M_sun and (1.1+/-0.3)X10^3 cm^-3 for

sufficient to produce the detected gamma-ray flux, thus favoring a hadronic
origin for the high-energy emission.

Multiscale Finite Element Method (GMsFEM) framework. This error indicator is
further used to develop an adaptive enrichment algorithm for the linear
elliptic equation with multiscale high-contrast coefficients. The GMsFEM, which
has recently been introduced in [12], allows solving multiscale
parameter-dependent problems at a reduced computational cost by constructing a
reduced-order representation of the solution on a coarse grid. The main idea of
the method consists of (1) the construction of snapshot space, (2) the
construction of the offline space, and (3) the construction of the online space
(the latter for parameter-dependent problems). In [12], it was shown that the
GMsFEM provides a flexible tool to solve multiscale problems with a complex
input space by generating appropriate snapshot, offline, and online spaces. In
this paper, we study an adaptive enrichment procedure and derive an
a-posteriori error indicator which gives an estimate of the local error over
coarse grid regions. We consider two kinds of error indicators where one is
based on the $L^2$-norm of the local residual and the other is based on the
weighted $H^{-1}$-norm of the local residual where the weight is related to the
coefficient of the elliptic equation. We show that the use of weighted
$H^{-1}$-norm residual gives a more robust error indicator which works well for
cases with high contrast media. The convergence analysis of the method is
given. In our analysis, we do not consider the error due to the fine-grid
discretization of local problems and only study the errors due to the
enrichment. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the robustness of
the proposed error indicators.

exoplanetary interiors and atmospheres are particularly sensitive to elemental
C/O ratio, which to first order can be estimated from the host stars. Results
from a recent spectroscopic study analyzing the 6300A [O I] line and two C I

However oxygen abundances derived using the 6300A [O I] line are highly
sensitive to a Ni I blend, particularly in metal-rich stars such as 55 Cnc
([Fe/H]=0.34+/-0.18). Here, we further investigate 55 Cnc's composition by
deriving the carbon and oxygen abundances from these and additional C and O
absorption features. We find that the measured C/O ratio depends on the oxygen
lines used. The C/O ratio that we derive based on the 6300A [O I] line alone is
consistent with the previous value. Yet, our investigation of additional
abundance indicators results in a mean C/O ratio of 0.78+/-0.08. The lower C/O
ratio of 55 Cnc determined here may place this system at the sensitive boundary
between protoplanetary disk compositions giving rise to planets with high

single robot tasked with monitoring several events of interest that occur at
different locations. Of particular interest is the monitoring of transient
events that can not be easily forecast. Application areas range from natural
phenomena ({\em e.g.}, monitoring abnormal seismic activity around a volcano
using a ground robot) to urban activities ({\em e.g.}, monitoring early
formations of traffic congestion using an aerial robot). Motivated by those and
many other examples, this paper focuses on problems in which the precise
occurrence times of the events are unknown {\em a priori}, but statistics for
their inter-arrival times are available. The robot's task is to monitor the
events to optimize the following two objectives: {\em (i)} maximize the number
of events observed and {\em (ii)} minimize the delay between two consecutive
observations of events occurring at the same location. The paper considers the
case when a robot is tasked with optimizing the event observations in a
balanced manner, following a cyclic patrolling route. First, assuming the
cyclic ordering of stations is known, we prove the existence and uniqueness of
the optimal solution, and show that the optimal solution has desirable
convergence and robustness properties. Our constructive proof also produces an
efficient algorithm for computing the unique optimal solution with $O(n)$ time
complexity, in which $n$ is the number of stations, with $O(\log n)$ time
complexity for incrementally adding or removing stations. Except for the
algorithm, most of the analysis remains valid when the cyclic order is unknown.
We then provide a polynomial-time approximation scheme that gives a
$(1+\epsilon)$-optimal solution for this more general, NP-hard problem.

of very massive stars. The central engine of a GRB can collimate relativistic
jets that propagate inside the stellar envelope. The shock waves produced when
the jet disrupts the stellar surface are capable of accelerating particles up
to very high energies. If the jet has hadronic content, neutrinos will be
produced via charged pion decays. The main goal of this work is to estimate the
neutrino emission produced in the region close to the surface of the star,
taking pion and muon cooling into account, along with subtle effects arising
from neutrino production in a highly magnetized medium. We estimate the maximum
energies of the different kinds of particles and solve the coupled transport
equations for each species. Once the particle distributions are known, we
calculate the intensity of neutrinos. We study the different effects on the
neutrinos that can change the relative weight of different flavors. In
particular, we consider the effects of neutrino oscillations, and of neutrino
spin precession caused by strong magnetic fields. The expected neutrino signals
from the shocks in the uncorking regions of Population III events is very weak,
but the neutrino signal produced by Wolf-Rayet GRBs with $z<0.5$ is not far
from the level of the atmospheric background. The IceCube experiment does not
have the sensitivity to detect neutrinos from the implosion of the earliest
stars, but a number of high-energy neutrinos may be detected from nearby long
GRBs. The cumulative signal should be detectable over several years ($\sim 10$
yr) of integration with the full 86-string configuration.

interaction in the epitaxial thin films. Epitaxial LPCMO thin films of various
thicknesses are grown on LaAlO3 substrate by pulsed laser deposition. With
increasing thickness, by virtue of island growth morphology, strain disorder is
invoked in thin films during strain relaxation process. The length-scale of
phase separation is found to be highly correlated with strain disorder.
Magneto-transport measurements demonstrate that coherent strain stabilizes
charge ordered insulating phase while strain disorder stabilizes metallic
phase. Resistivity under cooling and heating in unequal field (CHUF) protocol
exhibits lower value of freezing temperature for strain disordered films
compared to bulk system. Raman spectroscopy reveals that the charge ordered
insulating and ferromagnetic metallic phases are structurally dissimilar and
possess monoclinic and rhombohedral like symmetries respectively. Interfaces
between two phases strongly influence low temperature glassy metastable state
resulting in different phase separation states in the LPCMO thin films.

velocities of disk galaxies, so-called Tully-Fisher relations (TFRs), offer a
wealth of applications in galaxy evolution and cosmology. However, measurements
of rotational velocities require galaxy inclinations, which are difficult to
measure, thus limiting the range of TFR studies. This work introduces a maximum
likelihood estimation (MLE) method for recovering the TFR in galaxy samples
with limited or no information on inclinations. The robustness and accuracy of
this method is demonstrated using virtual and real galaxy samples.
Intriguingly, the MLE reliably recovers the TFR of all test samples, even
without using any inclination measurements - that is, assuming a
sin(i)-distribution for galaxy inclinations. Explicitly, this 'inclination-free
MLE' recovers the three TFR parameters (zero-point, slope, scatter) with
statistical errors only about 1.5-times larger than the best estimates based on
perfectly known galaxy inclinations with zero uncertainty. Thus, given
realistic uncertainties, the inclination-free MLE is highly competitive. If
inclination measurements have mean errors larger than 10 degrees, it is better
not to use any inclinations, than to consider the inclination measurements to
be exact. The inclination-free MLE opens interesting perspectives for future HI
surveys by the SKA and its pathfinders.

bremsstrahlung radiation. Separation of the two different emission components
is crucial to study the properties of diffuse interstellar medium. The Cygnus X
region is one of the most complex areas in the radio sky which contains a
number of massive stars and HII regions on the diffuse thermal and non-thermal
background. More supernova remnants are expected to be discovered. We aim to
develop a method which can properly separate the non-thermal and thermal radio
continuum emission and apply it to the Cygnus X region. The result can be used
to study the properties of different emission components and search for new
supernova remnants in the complex. Multi-frequency radio continuum data from
large-scale surveys are used to develop a new component separation method.
Spectral analysis is done pixel by pixel for the non-thermal synchrotron
emission with a realistic spectral index distribution and a fixed spectral
index of beta = -2.1 for the thermal bremsstrahlung emission. With the new
method, we separate the non-thermal and thermal components of the Cygnus X
region at an angular resolution of 9.5arcmin. The thermal emission component is
found to comprise 75% of the total continuum emission at 6cm. Thermal diffuse
emission, rather than the discrete HII regions, is found to be the major
contributor to the entire thermal budget. A smooth non-thermal emission
background of 100 mK Tb is found. We successfully make the large-extent known
supernova remnants and the HII regions embedded in the complex standing out,
but no new large SNRs brighter than Sigma_1GHz = 3.7 x 10^-21 W m^-2 Hz^-1

trade-offs between physiological responses and evolutionary adaptation that act
at different time scales. To identify patterns of molecular function and
genetic diversity in GRNs, we studied the drought response of the common
sunflower, Helianthus annuus, and how the underlying GRN is related to its
evolution. We examined the responses of 32,423 expressed sequences to drought
and to abscisic acid and selected 145 co-expressed transcripts. We
characterized their regulatory relationships in nine kinetic studies based on
different hormones. From this, we inferred a GRN by meta-analyses of a Gaussian
graphical model and a random forest algorithm and studied the genetic
differentiation among populations (FST) at nodes. We identified two main hubs
in the network that transport nitrate in guard cells. This suggests that
nitrate transport is a critical aspect of sunflower physiological response to
drought. We observed that differentiation of the network genes in elite
sunflower cultivars is correlated with their position and connectivity. This
systems biology approach combined molecular data at different time scales and
identified important physiological processes. At the evolutionary level, we
propose that network topology could influence responses to human selection and
possibly adaptation to dry environments.

approach is motivated by the demand for pseudopotentials able to address
nanostructures, where \textit{ab initio} methods are both too costly and
insufficiently accurate at the level of the local-density approximation, while
mesoscopic effective-mass approaches are inapplicable due to the small size of
the structures along, at least, one dimension. In this work we improve the
traditional pseudopotential method by a two-step process: First, we invert a
set of self-consistently determined screened {\it ab initio} potentials in
wurtzite GaN for a range of unit cell volumes, thus determining
spherically-symmetric and structurally averaged atomic potentials. Second, we
adjust the potentials to reproduce observed excitation energies. We find that
the adjustment represents a reasonably small perturbation over the potential,
so that the ensuing potential still reproduces the original wave functions,
while the excitation energies are significantly improved. We furthermore deal
with the passivation of the dangling bonds of free surfaces which is relevant
for the study of nanowires and colloidal nanoparticles. We present a
methodology to derive passivant pseudopotentials from {\it ab initio}
calculations. We apply our pseudopotential approach to the exploration of the

supposing both logic and arithmetic interpretation of data. It is shown that
any non-empty CTS in dual interpretation represents some unique Boolean formula

any 3-CNF formula is transformed by decomposition to a system of discordant
CTS's, each being associated with an individual permutation of variables
constructed by a polynomial algorithm. As a result the problem of the formula
satisfiability is reduced to the following one: ascertain the fact of existence
(or absence) of a ""joint satisfying set"" (JSS) for all discordant structures,
based on the different permutations. Further transformation of each CTS to CCS
is used; correctness of preservation of the allowed sets is reached by simple
algorithmic restrictions on triplets concatenation. Then the procedure of
""inverting of the same name columns"" in the various structures is entered for
the purpose of reducing the problem of JSS revealing to elementary detection of
n-tuples of zeros in the CCS system. The formula is synthesized, being on the

electron gas (2DEG) in the quantum Hall effect (QHE) regime, studying the
hysteresis of magnetoresistance of a 2DEG with a constriction. The large
amplitude of the hysteresis enabled us to make the consistent phenomenological
description of the hysteresis. We studied the dependence on the magnetic field
sweep prehistory (minor loop measurements), recovered the anhysteretic curve,
and studied the time dependence of the magnetoresistance. We showed that the
hysteresis of magnetoresistance of a 2DEG in the QHE regime has significant
phenomenological similarities with the hysteresis of magnetization of
ferromagnetic materials, showing multistability, jumps of relaxation, and
having the anhysteretic curve. Nevertheless, we revealed the crucial
difference, manifested itself in an unusual inverted (anti-coercive) behavior
of the magnetoresistance hysteresis. The time relaxation of the hysteresis has
fast and slow regimes, similar to that of non-equilibrium magnetization of a
2DEG in QHE regime pointing to their common origin. We studied the dependence
of the hysteresis loop area on the lithographic width of the constriction and
found the threshold value of width $\sim$1.35 $\mu$m beyond which the
hysteresis is not observed. This points to the edge nature of the
non-equilibrium currents (NECs) and allows us to determine the width of the
NECs area ($\sim$0.5 $\mu$m). We suggest the qualitative picture of the
observed hysteresis, based on non-equilibrium redistribution of the electrons
among the Landau level states and assuming huge imbalance between the
population of bulk and edge electronic states.

discover that the \emph{e-e} interaction in 2D systems with SIA not only can

analytical expressions for many-body corrections to ESR energy and the

out that \emph{e-e} interaction does not affect the ESR energy in the case of

concept, in particular for the principal observation mode, the scan map. The
absolute flux calibration is tied to the photospheric models of five fiducial
stellar standards (alpha Boo, alpha Cet, alpha Tau, beta And, gamma Dra). The
data processing steps to arrive at a consistent and homogeneous calibration are
outlined. In the current state the relative photometric accuracy is around 2%
in all bands. Starting from the present calibration status, the
characterization and correction for instrumental effects affecting the relative
calibration accuracy is described and an outlook for the final achievable
calibration numbers is given. After including all the correction for the
instrumental effects, the relative photometric calibration accuracy
(repeatability) will be as good as 0.5% in the blue and green band and 2% in
the red band. This excellent calibration starts to reveal possible
inconsistencies between the models of the K-type and the M-type stellar
calibrators. The absolute calibration accuracy is therefore mainly limited by
the 5% uncertainty of the celestial standard models in all three bands. The
PACS bolometer response was extremely stable over the entire Herschel mission
and a single, time-independent response calibration file is sufficient for the
processing and calibration of the science observations. The dedicated
measurements of the internal calibration sources were needed only to
characterize secondary effects. No aging effects of the bolometer or the
filters have been found. Also, we found no signs of filter leaks. The PACS
photometric system is very well characterized with a constant energy spectrum

measurements of stellar color excess in the optical. We have assembled color
excess data together with the associated parallax or photometric distances to
constitute a catalog of ~ 23,000 sightlines for stars within 2.5 kpc. The
photometric data are taken from Stromgren catalogs, the Geneva photometric
database, and the Geneva-Copenhagen survey. We also included extinctions
derived towards open clusters. We applied, to this color excess dataset, an
inversion method based on a regularized Bayesian approach, previously used for
mapping at closer distances. We show the dust spatial distribution resulting
from the inversion by means of planar cuts through the differential opacity 3D
distribution, and by means of 2D maps of the integrated opacity from the Sun up
to various distances. The mapping assigns locations to the nearby dense clouds
and represents their distribution at the spatial resolution that is allowed by
the dataset properties, i.e. of the order of ~10 pc close to the Sun and
increasing to ~100 pc beyond 1 kpc. Biases towards nearby and/or weakly
extincted stars make this dataset particularly appropriate to map the local and
neighboring cavities, and to locate faint, extended nearby clouds, both goals
that are difficult or impossible with other mapping methods. The new maps
reveal a ~1 kpc wide empty region in the third quadrant in the continuation of
the so-called CMa tunnel of the Local Cavity, a cavity that we identify as the
Superbubble GSH238+00+09 detected in radio emission maps and that is found to

minisuperspace spherically symmetric model both at the classical and quantum
level. After integration of the coordinates $t$, $\theta$ and $\phi$ in the
gravitational plus electromagnetic action the configuration space dependent
dynamical variables turn out to correspond to the $r$-dependent metric
functions and the electrostatic field. In the context of the formalism for
constrained systems (Dirac - Bergmann, ADM) with respect to the radial
coordinate $r$, we set up a point-like reparameterization invariant Lagrangian.
It is seen that, in the constant potential parametrization of the lapse, the
corresponding minisuperspace is a Lorentzian three-dimensional flat manifold
which obviously admits six Killing vector fields plus a homothetic one. The
weakly vanishing $r$-Hamiltonian guarantees that the phase space quantities
associated to the six Killing fields are linear holonomic integrals of motion.
The homothetic field provides one more rheonomic integral of motion. These
seven integrals are shown to comprise the entire classical solution space, i.e.
the space-time of a Reissner-Nordstr\""om black hole, the $r$-reparametrization
invariance since one dependent variable remains unfixed, and the two quadratic
relations satisfied by the integration constants. We then quantize the model
using the quantum analogues of the classical conditional symmetries, and show
that the existence of such symmetries yields solutions to the Wheeler-DeWitt
equation which, as a semiclassical analysis shows, exhibit a good correlation
with the classical regime. We use the resulting wave functions to investigate
the possibility of removing the classical singularities.

estimation in hydrological modeling, as well as in the planning and design of

generalized extreme value (GEV) distributions with latent Gaussian fields in a

GEV distribution are able to incorporate location-specific geographic and
meteorological information and thereby accommodate these effects on extreme
precipitation. A Gaussian field on the GEV parameters captures additional
unexplained spatial heterogeneity and overcomes the sparse grid on which

appropriately characterize both the spatial variability of the distribution of

one-dimensional boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) have been theoretically
predicted and later synthesised. Here we use first principles simulations to
unambiguously demonstrate that i) BN nanotubes inherit the highly efficient UV

defects in BNNTS are responsible for tunable light emission from the UV to the

effective permittivity of several manganite compounds can be ascribed to the
chemical capacitance C_{\mu}=e^2\partial N_{i}/\partial \mu_{i} expressed in
terms of the chemical potential \mu. The chemical capacitance C_{\mu}^{(cb)} =
e^2 n_{C}/k_{B}T depends on temperature when the conduction electrons with
density n_{C} = N_{C} \exp(\mu_{n}- E_{C})/k_{B}T are considered. The
experimental results obtained for the manganite compounds, at high temperature
range, are discussed in the framework of the chemical capacitance model.
However, the measured capacitance dependence on geometrical factors is analysed
for BiMnO_{3} indicating that the non-homogeneous electrostatic capacitor model
is valid in 300-500 K range.

existing centralized algorithms for graph computation and makes them
distributed and faster. In a nutshell, PM divides the graph into small
subgraphs using our novel randomized partitioning scheme, runs the centralized
algorithm on each partition separately, and then stitches the resulting
solutions to produce a global solution. We demonstrate the efficiency of the PM
algorithm on two popular problems: computation of Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)
assignment in an arbitrary pairwise Markov Random Field (MRF), and modularity
optimization for community detection. We show that the resulting distributed
algorithms for these problems essentially run in time linear in the number of
nodes in the graph, and perform as well -- or even better -- than the original
centralized algorithm as long as the graph has geometric structures. Here we
say a graph has geometric structures, or polynomial growth property, when the
number of nodes within distance r of any given node grows no faster than a
polynomial function of r. More precisely, if the centralized algorithm is a
C-factor approximation with constant C \ge 1, the resulting distributed
algorithm is a (C+\delta)-factor approximation for any small \delta>0; but if
the centralized algorithm is a non-constant (e.g. logarithmic) factor
approximation, then the resulting distributed algorithm becomes a constant
factor approximation. For general graphs, we compute explicit bounds on the
loss of performance of the resulting distributed algorithm with respect to the
centralized algorithm.

Isolated Dwarfs project, we present the star formation histories, as a function
of galactocentric radius, of four isolated Local Group dwarf galaxies: two dSph
galaxies, Cetus and Tucana, and two transition galaxies (dTrs), LGS-3 and
Phoenix. The oldest stellar populations of the dSphs and dTrs are, within the
uncertainties, coeval ($\sim 13 Gyr$) at all galactocentric radii. We find that
there are no significative differences between the four galaxies in the
fundamental properties (such as the normalized star formation rate or
age-metallicity relation) of their outer regions (radii greater than four
exponential scale lengths); at large radii, these galaxies consist exclusively
of old ($\geq 10.5 Gyr$) metal-poor stars. The duration of star formation in
the inner regions vary from galaxy to galaxy, and the extended central star
formation in the dTrs produces the dichotomy between dSph and dTr galaxy types.
The dTr galaxies show prominent radial stellar population gradients: the
centers of these galaxies host young ($\leq 1 Gyr$) populations while the age
of the last formation event increases smoothly with increasing radius. This
contrasts with the two dSph galaxies. Tucana shows a similar, but milder,
gradient, but no gradient in age is detected Cetus. For the three galaxies with
significant stellar population gradients, the exponential scale length
decreases with time. These results are in agreement with outside-in scenarios
of dwarf galaxy evolution, in which a quenching of the star formation toward
the center occurs as the galaxy runs out of gas in the outskirts.

Likewise, many current street map comparison algorithms focus on the spatial

these algorithms insensitive to local connectivity properties and shortest path
similarities. We propose a new path-based distance measure to compare two

of complex systems. It tends to tame the complexity of systems, to facilitate
their management, and to enhance their flexibility with respect to evolution.
In software, modularization has been practiced and studied thoroughly in local,
i.e. non-distributed systems. But very little attention has been paid so far to
modularization in distributed systems. This is, in part, because distributed
systems are inherently modularized, in the sense that the internals of each
component of such a system is inaccessible to other components, thus satisfying
the Parnas hiding principle. It is, however, the thesis of this paper that
there is much to be gained by being able to treat groups of distributed
components as modules, called here distributed modules. And that besides the
conventional hiding principle, distributed modularization should provide
additional capabilities, which rarely, if ever, figure in conventional
modularized systems. These capabilities include, but are not limited to: the
ability to impose constraints on which kind of messages can be sent from a
given distributed-module to its outside; and the ability to create AOP-like
crosscutting modules. This paper introduces a model of modular distributed
system, orMDS, which satisfies such capabilities, and which is implemented via
the LGI middleware.

allow us to discriminate the blueshifted and redshifted components in a roughly
east--west direction in both IRAS 18151--1208 and S106 in Br$\gamma$. This lies
almost perpendicular to observed larger scale outflows. We conclude, given the

majority of its applications are exposed to Internet, which increases the
threats of security considerably. Thus, the solution is to improve tools and
mechanisms to strengthen the protection of applications against attacks and
ensure the different security objectives. Among solutions we will talking
about, in this paper, there is Mutation Analysis which is a technique of test
that evaluates the quality of software tests and their ability to detect
errors, It also compares the criteria and test generation strategies. In this
study we will use the Mutation Analysis as a mean to qualify the penetration
tests, and then, apply this technique in the security mechanisms and exactly on
the mechanisms of access control. At the end we will propose a method for the
elimination of hidden mechanisms for access control that will allow the access
control policy to evolve.

Carrington coordinate system when they can be identified at all. By following
this migration, the longitudinal activity distribution around the center of the
band can be determined. The halfwidth of the distribution is found to be
varying in Cycles 21 - 23, and in some time intervals it was as narrow as 20 -
30 degrees. It was more extended around maximum but it was also narrow when the
activity jumped to the opposite longitude. Flux emergence exhibited a
quasi-periodic variation within the active zone with a period of about 1.3
years. The path of the active longitude migration does not support the view
that it might be associated with the 11-year solar cycle. These results were
obtained for a limited time interval of a few solar cycles and, bearing in mind
uncertainties of the migration path definition, are only indicative. For the
major fraction of dataset no systematic active longitudes were found. Sporadic
migration of active longitudes was identified only for Cycles 21 - 22 in the
northern hemisphere and Cycle 23 in the southern hemisphere.

Being based on FIR NTFs, possibly with high order, the flow is best suited for
digital architectures. The work builds on a recent proposal where the modulator
is matched to the reconstruction filter, showing that this type of optimization
can benefit a wide range of applications where noise (including in-band noise)
is known to have a different impact at different frequencies. The design of a
multiband modulator, a modulator avoiding DC noise, and an audio modulator
capable of distributing quantization artifacts according to a psychoacoustic

system where charge transfer is expected, we show here how the empirical EAM
formalism is able to satisfactorily describe several physical properties in a
wide range of Li concentration. Application of our potential to Li-Pb eutectic

that the success of this process substantially depends on the possibility of

each event of measurement one of incompatible observables.
  A new value, the complexity of measurement of a state, is used, this
characterizes the number of the measurement events needed for solution of the
reconstruction problem. By means of this value it is shown that the dependence
of the upper limit of the needed number of measurements on the permissible
error is a square law one, so a twofold decrease of permissible error
corresponds to a fourfold increase of needed number of measurements.

supernovae from massive stars. Gravitational waves (GW) offer a probe of the
physics behind long GRBs. We investigate models of long-lived (~10-1000s) GW
emission associated with the accretion disk of a collapsed star or with its
protoneutron star remnant. Using data from LIGO's fifth science run, and GRB
triggers from the swift experiment, we perform a search for unmodeled
long-lived GW transients. Finding no evidence of GW emission, we place 90%
confidence level upper limits on the GW fluence at Earth from long GRBs for
three waveforms inspired by a model of GWs from accretion disk instabilities.
These limits range from F<3.5 ergs cm^-2 to $F<1200 ergs cm^-2, depending on
the GRB and on the model, allowing us to probe optimistic scenarios of GW
production out to distances as far as ~33 Mpc. Advanced detectors are expected
to achieve strain sensitivities 10x better than initial LIGO, potentially
allowing us to probe the engines of the nearest long GRBs.

is considered. We focus on the role played by viscous friction in the spinning
motion of the disk, especially on the effect called reverse rotation, where the
intrinsic and orbital rotations are antiparallel. Contrary to what happens in
the frictionless case, where steady reverse rotations are possible, we find
that this dynamical behavior may exist only as a transient when dissipation is
considered. Whether or not reverse rotations in fact occur depend on the
initial conditions and on two parameters, one related to dragging, inertia, and
driving, the other associated with the geometric configuration of the system.
The critical value of this geometric parameter (separating the regions where
reverse rotation is possible from those where it is forbidden) as a function of
viscosity is well adjusted by a q-exponential function.

models such as ITER. Such simulations are challenging since streaming and deep
penetration effects are equally important. In order to make such simulations
tractable, both variance reduction (VR) techniques and parallel computing are
used. It has been found that the application of VR techniques in such models
significantly reduces the efficiency of parallel computation due to 'long
histories'. VR in MCNP can be accomplished using energy-dependent weight
windows. The weight window represents an 'average behaviour' of particles, and
large deviations in the arriving weight of a particle give rise to extreme
amounts of splitting being performed and a long history. When running on
parallel clusters, a long history can have a detrimental effect on the parallel
efficiency - if one process is computing the long history, the other CPUs
complete their batch of histories and wait idle. Furthermore some long
histories have been found to be effectively intractable. To combat this effect,
CCFE has developed an adaptation of MCNP which dynamically adjusts the WW where
a large weight deviation is encountered. The method effectively 'de-optimises'
the WW, reducing the VR performance but this is offset by a significant
increase in parallel efficiency. Testing with a simple geometry has shown the
method does not bias the result. This 'long history method' has enabled CCFE to
significantly improve the performance of MCNP calculations for ITER on parallel
clusters, and will be beneficial for any geometry combining streaming and deep
penetration effects.

correct quantum mechanical predictions of its behavior, even when there is
quantum entanglement between components of that circuit. It addresses an
important example, the circuit of the original Bell's Theorem experiments for
ideal polarizers. Correct predictions emerge from two alternative simple but
time-symmetric models based on classical Markov Random Field across space time.
Exact agreement here does not violate Bell's Theorem itself, because the
interplay between initial and final outcomes in these calculations does not
fall within the CHSH definition of time forwards causality. Both models raise
interesting questions for future research. The final section discusses several
possible directions for following up on these results, both in lumped system
modeling and in more general approaches. The final section proposed a new

of noble metal nanoparticles with LSPR absorption and magnetic metal

nanoparticles are prepared by a self assembly method using pulsed laser
deposition. We performed measurements of the static Faraday and time-resolved
Faraday effects using a pump probe technique on the AgCo hybrid nanoparticles

indicate that the amount of energy transferred from the laser pulses to the

this model, the emitting region is out of equipartition and the jet is particle
dominated. Because of its high redshift compared to other sources observed at

the extragalactic background light (EBL) and the measured spectrum is used to
derive an upper limit on the opacity of the EBL.

is its potentially low environmental impact and very good safety performance.
But this safety and environmental potential can only be fully realized by
careful design choices. For DEMO and other fusion facilities that will require
nuclear licensing, S&E objectives and criteria should be set at an early stage
and taken into account when choosing basic design options and throughout the
design process. Studies in recent decades of the safety of fusion power plant
concepts give a useful basis on which to build the S&E approach and to assess
the impact of design choices. The experience of licensing ITER is of particular
value, even though there are some important differences between ITER and DEMO.
The ITER project has developed a safety case, produced a preliminary safety
report and had it examined by the French nuclear safety authorities, leading to
the licence to construct the facility. The key technical issues that arose
during this process are recalled, particularly those that may also have an
impact on DEMO safety. These include issues related to postulated accident
scenarios, environmental releases during operation, occupational radiation
exposure, and radioactive waste.

provides important information on the propagation mechanisms and the
identification of their sources. In fact, the flux of cosmic rays is thought to
be dependent on the arrival direction only due to the presence of nearby cosmic
ray sources or particular magnetic-field structures. Recently, the observation
of unexpected excesses at TeV energy down to angular scale as narrow as
$\sim10\deg$ raised the possibility that the problem of the origin of galactic
cosmic rays may be addressed by studying the anisotropy.
  The ARGO-YBJ experiment is a full-coverage EAS array, sensitive to cosmic
rays with energy threshold of a few hundred GeV. Searching for small-size
deviations from the isotropy, the ARGO-YBJ collaboration explored the
declination region $\delta\sim-20^{\circ}\div 80^{\circ}$, making use of about
3.7$\cdot10^{11}$ events collected from November 2007 to May 2012.
  In this paper the detection of different significant (up to 13 standard
deviations) medium-scale anisotropy regions in the arrival directions of CRs is
reported. The observation was performed with unprecedented detail. The relative
excess intensity with respect to the isotropic flux extends up to 10$^{-3}$.
The maximum excess occurs for proton energies of 10-20 TeV, suggesting the
presence of unknown features of the magnetic fields the charged cosmic rays
propagate through, or some contribution of nearby sources never considered so
far.
  The observation of new weaker few-degree excesses throughout the sky region
$195^{\circ}\leq$ \ra $\leq 290^{\circ}$ is reported for the first time.

by DPS, in $p$-$p$ and in $p$-$A$ collisions. In $p$-$A$ collisions the
interpretation of the experimental results may be however complicated by the
presence of interference terms, which are missing in $p$-$p$. A suitable
reaction channel, where interference terms are absent, is $WJJ$ production. By
studying $WJJ$ production in $p$-$Pb$ collisions, we estimate that the fraction
of events due to DPS may be larger by a factor 3 or 4, as compared to $p$-$p$,
while the amount of the increased fraction can give a direct indication on the
importance of different correlation terms.

sentiment analysis, mostly on highly subjective text types (movie or product
reviews). The main difference these texts have with news articles is that their
target is clearly defined and unique across the text. Following different
annotation efforts and the analysis of the issues encountered, we realised that
news opinion mining is different from that of other text types. We identified
three subtasks that need to be addressed: definition of the target; separation
of the good and bad news content from the good and bad sentiment expressed on
the target; and analysis of clearly marked opinion that is expressed
explicitly, not needing interpretation or the use of world knowledge.
Furthermore, we distinguish three different possible views on newspaper
articles - author, reader and text, which have to be addressed differently at
the time of analysing sentiment. Given these definitions, we present work on
mining opinions about entities in English language news, in which (a) we test
the relative suitability of various sentiment dictionaries and (b) we attempt
to separate positive or negative opinion from good or bad news. In the
experiments described here, we tested whether or not subject domain-defining
vocabulary should be ignored. Results showed that this idea is more appropriate
in the context of news opinion mining and that the approaches taking this into
consideration produce a better performance.

surely converges to the disk of radius $\sqrt{2}$. Since the spectrum of

friendship is visible in both the users' friend lists. Such a dual visibility
of the friendship may raise privacy threats. This is because both users can
separately control the visibility of a friendship link to other users and their
privacy policies for the link may not be consistent. Even if one of them
conceals the link from a third user, the third user may find such a friendship
link from another user's friend list. In addition, as most users allow their
friends to see their friend lists in most social network systems, an adversary
can exploit the inconsistent policies to launch privacy attacks to identify and
infer many of a targeted user's friends. In this paper, we propose, analyze and
evaluate such an attack which is called Friendship Identification and Inference
(FII) attack. In a FII attack scenario, we assume that an adversary can only
see his friend list and the friend lists of his friends who do not hide the
friend lists from him. Then, a FII attack contains two attack steps: 1) friend
identification and 2) friend inference. In the friend identification step, the
adversary tries to identify a target's friends based on his friend list and
those of his friends. In the friend inference step, the adversary attempts to
infer the target's friends by using the proposed random walk with restart
approach. We present experimental results using three real social network
datasets and show that FII attacks are generally efficient and effective when
adversaries and targets are friends or 2-distant neighbors. We also
comprehensively analyze the attack results in order to find what values of
parameters and network features could promote FII attacks. Currently, most
popular social network systems with an undirected friendship graph, such as
Facebook, LinkedIn and Foursquare, are susceptible to FII attacks.

emission with the already known low-energy J=2-1 and J=1-0 lines confirms that
the high-velocity component, or fast bipolar outflow, is hotter than previously
estimated with a typical temperature of ~300 K. This component may then be an
example of a very recent acceleration of the gas by shocks that has not yet
cooled down. We also find that the dense central core is characterized by a
very low expansion velocity, ~5 km/s, and a strong velocity gradient. We
conclude that this component is very likely to be the unaltered circumstellar
layers that are lost in the last AGB phase, where the ejection velocity is
particularly low. The physical properties of the other two nebular components,
the diffuse halo and the double empty shell, more or less agrees with the

increased, at fixed \bar{\phi}_{P}, micelles occur at higher temperature, and
the temperature-dependent range of micellar aggregation and half-width of

uncertainty on the solution is investigated building response surfaces for
decay power-law exponents of usual physical quantities. Large-scale
uncertainties are considered, the emphasis being put on Saffman and Batchelor
turbulence. The sensitivity of the solution to initial spectrum uncertainties
is quantified through probability density functions of the decay exponents. It
is observed that initial spectrum shape at very large scales governs the
long-time evolution, even at high Reynolds number, a parameter which is not
explicitly taken into account in many theoretical works. Therefore, a universal
asymptotic behavior in which kinetic energy decays as $t^{-1}$ is not detected.
But this decay law is observed at finite Reynolds number with low probability

effect. Transfer of absorbed power between two superradiant oscillators is
controlled by manipulating two coupling strengths conjugated through the
polarization angle of a normally incident electromagnetic wave.

quarkvgluon deconfined degrees of freedom is the essential ingredient in
determining the conditions in a transition between phases that has time to
develop into equilibrium. The degree of freedom in the confined hadronic matter
phase and the deconfined phase, that is, the QGP, is important in the study of
phase transition in the early universe. It is calculated according to the
strong coupling constant. But in the present work, we try to figure out the
effect of the running coupling constant in the calculation of the degree of

of the single segments. It covers gravitational wave frequencies in a range
from 78 to 496 Hz and a frequency-dependent range of first order spindown

we reach ~3.35x10^-25 for frequencies near 150 Hz. These upper limits are the

representation of a nilpotent Lie group requires a precise computation of some
polarizing subalgebra subordinated to a linear functional in the linear dual of
the corresponding Lie algebra. This important step is generally challenging
from a computational viewpoint. In this paper, we provide an algorithmic
approach to the construction of the well-known Vergne polarizing subalgebras
\cite{Corwin}. The algorithms presented in this paper are specifically designed
so that they can be implemented in Computer Algebra Systems. We also show there
are instances where Vergne's construction could be refined for the sake of
efficiency. Finally, we adapt our refined procedure to free nilpotent
finite-dimensional Lie algebras of step-two to obtain simple and precise
descriptions of Vergne polarizing algebras corresponding to all linear
functionals in a Zariski open subset of the linear dual of the corresponding
Lie algebra. Several explicit examples are given throughout the paper. Also, a
program written for Mathematica is presented at the end of the paper.

theorem for the orthogonal polynomial ensemble associated with any measure

our results by deriving Central Limit Theorems for the Hahn ensemble for

preferential attachment and a previously unexamined process of ""splitting""
nodes of degree $k$ into $k$ nodes of degree 1. Four networks are considered,
each evolves at each time step by either preferential attachment, with
probability $p$, or splitting with probability $1-p$. Two methods of attachment
are considered; first, attachment of an edge between a newly created node and
existing node in the network, and secondly by attachment of an edge between two
existing nodes. Splitting is also considered in two separate ways; first by
selecting each node with equal probability and secondly, selecting the node
with probability proportional to its degree. Exact solutions for the degree
distributions are found and scale-free structure is exhibited in those networks
where the candidates for splitting are chosen with uniform probability, those
that are chosen preferentially are distributed with a power law with
exponential cut-off.

photoexcitations in a polymeric semiconductor heterojunction which includes
both polymer pi-stacking, energetic disorder, and phonon relaxation. Results
from our model are consistent with a wide range of recent experimental evidence
that excitons decay directly to well-defined polarons on a sub-100 fs
timescale, which is substantially faster than exciton relaxation processes.
Averaging over multiple samples, we find that as the interfacial offset is
increased, a substantial fraction of the density of electronic states in the
energy region about the initial exciton carries significant charge-transfer
character with two charges separated in the outer regions of the model lattice.
The results indicate a slight increase in the density of such current-producing
states if the region close to the interface is more disordered. However, since
their density of states overlaps the excitation line-shape of the primary
exciton, we show that it is possible that the exciton can decay directly into
current-producing states via tunneling on an ultrafast time-scale. We find this
process to be independent of the location of energetic disorder in the system,
and hence we expect exciton fission via resonant tunnelling to be a ubiquitous
feature of these systems.

preservation of the entanglement are the four parameters: the average number of
the coherent state, the ultra-strong coupling strength, the ratio of two
frequencies of qubit and oscillator, and the inter-interaction coupling of the
two qubits. The novel results show that the appropriate choice of these

were proved numerous times over the centuries. However, despite the popularity
of these results, it seems that no thorough and up-to-date historical account
of their proofs has ever been given, nor has an effort been made to reformulate
the oldest demonstrations in modern terms. The motivation of this paper is to
put these strongly related theorems back in their historical perspective. More
importantly, we suggest a way to understand Descartes's original statement,
which yet remains somewhat of an enigma. We found that this question is related
to a certain way of counting the alternations and permanences of signs of the
polynomial coefficients, and may have been the convention used by Descartes.
Remarkably, this convention not only provides a ultra-simple proof of
Descartes's rule, but it can also be used to simplify the proofs of the titular
theorems. Without claiming to be exhaustive, we shall present in this paper an
historical account of these theorems and their proofs, and clarify their mutual
relation. We will explain how a suitable convention can help understand the
original statement of Descartes and greatly simplify its proof, as well as the
proofs of the above-mentioned theorems. With the exception of the proof of
Fourier's theorem and its generalizations, which run on rudiments of
infinitesimal calculus (Taylor's theorem), the proposed demonstrations are so
short and elementary they could be taught at the undergraduate level.

1960s within the Phillips/Fisher framework. The change in labour force is the
driving force representing economic activity in the Phillips curve. For
Austria, this macroeconomic variable was first tested as a predictor of
inflation and unemployment in 2005 with the involved time series ended in 2003.
Here we extend all series by nine new readings available since 2003 and
re-estimate the previously estimated relationships between inflation,
unemployment, and labour force. As before, a structural break is allowed in
these relationships, which is related to numerous changes in definitions in the
1980s. The break year is estimated together with other model parameters by the
Boundary Element Method with the LSQ fitting between observed and predicted
integral curves. The precision of inflation prediction, as described by the
root-mean-square (forecasting) error is by 20% to 70% better than that
estimated by AR(1) model. The estimates of model forecasting error are
available for those time series where the change in labour force leads by one
(the GDP deflator) or two (CPI) years. For the whole period between 1965 and
2012 as well as for the intervals before and after the structural break (1986
for all inflation models) separately, our model is superior to the na\""ive
forecasting, which in turn, is not worse than any other forecasting model. The
level of statistical reliability and the predictive power of the link between
inflation and labour force imply that the National Bank of Austria does not
control inflation and unemployment beyond revisions to definitions. The labour
force projection provided by Statistic Austria allows foreseeing inflation at a
forty-year horizon: the rate of CPI inflation will hover around 1.3% and the
GDP deflator will likely sink below zero between 2018 and 2034.

equation in which the locations of the scattering centers in the system are
correlated and the distance-to-collision is not exponentially distributed; this
leads to an anisotropic diffusion equation. We show that the results predicted

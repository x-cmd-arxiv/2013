critical temperature in a one dimensional self-gravitating Brownian gas with a
modified Poisson equation experiencing a second order phase transition from a
homogeneous phase to an inhomogeneous phase. We numerically solve the $N$-body
Langevin equations and the stochastic Smoluchowski-Poisson system which takes
fluctuations (finite $N$ effects) into account. The system switches back and
forth between the two metastable states (bistability) and the particles
accumulate successively at the center or at the boundary of the domain. We show
that these random transitions exhibit the phenomenology of the ordinary Kramers
problem for a Brownian particle in a double-well potential. The distribution of
the residence time is Poissonian and the average lifetime of a metastable state
is given by the Arrhenius law, i.e. it is proportional to the exponential of
the barrier of free energy $\Delta F$ divided by $k_B T$. Since the free energy
is proportional to the number of particles $N$ for a system with long-range
interactions, the lifetime of metastable states scales as $e^N$ and is
considerable for $N\gg 1$. As a result, in many applications, metastable states
of systems with long-range interactions can be considered as stable states.
However, for moderate values of $N$, or close to a critical point $T_c$, the
lifetime of the metastable states is reduced since the barrier of free energy
decreases. In that case, the fluctuations become important and the mean field
approximation is no more valid. This is the situation considered in this paper.
By an appropriate change of notations, our results also apply to bacterial
populations experiencing chemotaxis in biology. Their dynamics can be described
by a stochastic Keller-Segel model that takes fluctuations into account and
goes beyond the usual mean field approximation.

$VPT({\cal P})$ is the VPT graph (i.e. the vertex intersection graph) of the
paths ${\cal P}$ of the tree $T$, and $EPT({\cal P})$ is the EPT graph (i.e.
the edge intersection graph) of ${\cal P}$. These graphs have been extensively
studied in the literature. Given two (edge) intersecting paths in a graph,
their \emph{split vertices} is the set of vertices having degree at least $3$
in their union. A pair of (edge) intersecting paths is termed
\emph{non-splitting} if they do not have split vertices (namely if their union
is a path).
  In this work, motivated by an application in all-optical networks, we define
the graph $ENPT({\cal P})$ of edge-intersecting non-splitting paths of a tree,
termed the ENPT graph, as the (edge) graph having a vertex for each path in
${\cal P}$, and an edge between every pair of paths that are both
edge-intersecting and non-splitting. A graph $G$ is an ENPT graph if there is a
tree $T$ and a set of paths ${\cal P}$ of $T$ such that $G=ENPT({\cal P})$, and
we say that $<T,{\cal P}>$ is a \emph{representation} of $G$. We first show
that cycles, trees and complete graphs are ENPT graphs.
  Our work follows the lines of Golumbic and Jamison's research in which they
defined the EPT graph class, and characterized the representations of chordless
cycles (holes). It turns out that ENPT holes have a more complex structure than
EPT holes. In our analysis, we assume that the EPT graph corresponding to a
representation of an ENPT hole is given. We also introduce three assumptions
$(P1)$, $(P2)$, $(P3)$ defined on EPT, ENPT pairs of graphs. In this Part I,
using the results of Golumbic and Jamison as building blocks, we characterize
(a) EPT, ENPT pairs that satisfy $(P1)$, $(P2)$, $(P3)$, and (b) the unique
minimal representation of such pairs.

the autocorrelation function of the out-of-transit light variations. Transit
duration, peak depth, and asymmetry evolve slowly, due to the slowly drifting

This has resulted in an ""arms race"" development process of discovering

performance guarantees can ever be provided.
  We develop a system-theoretic approach to security that provides a complete
protocol suite with provable guarantees, as well as proof of min-max optimality
with respect to any given utility function of source-destination rates. Our
approach is based on a model capturing the essential features of an adhoc
wireless network that has been infiltrated with hostile nodes. We consider any
collection of nodes, some good and some bad, possessing specified capabilities
vis-a-vis cryptography, wireless communication and clocks. The good nodes do
not know the bad nodes. The bad nodes can collaborate perfectly, and are
capable of any disruptive acts ranging from simply jamming to non-cooperation
with the protocols in any manner they please.
  The protocol suite caters to the complete life-cycle, all the way from birth
of nodes, through all phases of ad hoc network formation, leading to an
optimized network carrying data reliably. It provably achieves the min-max of
the utility function, where the max is over all protocol suites published and
followed by the good nodes, while the min is over all Byzantine behaviors of
the bad nodes. Under the protocol suite, the bad nodes do not benefit from any
actions other than jamming or cooperating.
  This approach supersedes much previous work that deals with several types of

strikingly different properties than their higher dimensional counterparts,

an extremal BTZ black hole forms. In this limit, all of the scalar field
becomes enclosed by the horizon; it does not contract to a singularity, but
rather the origin remains smooth and regular and the solution represents a
spinning boson star trapped inside a degenerate horizon. Additionally, whereas
in higher dimensions the mass, angular momentum, and angular velocity all
display damped harmonic oscillations as functions of the central energy
density, in $D=3$ these quantities change monotonically up to the bound on the

the existence of an optimal (minimum distortion) randomized quantizer having a

over social networks has become an important research issue. Most of the
existing works on information diffusion analysis are based on either network
structure modeling or empirical approach with dataset mining. However, the
information diffusion is also heavily influenced by network users' decisions,

non-uniform degree networks and derive the closed-form expressions of the
evolutionary stable network states. Moreover, the information diffusion over
two special networks, Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random network and the
Barab\'asi-Albert scale-free network, are also highlighted. To verify our
theoretical analysis, we conduct experiments by using both synthetic networks

$H$-free graphs on $n$ vertices are there? For non-bipartite $H$, the answer to
this question has been well-understood since 1986, when Erd\H{o}s, Frankl and
R\""odl proved that there are $2^{(1 + o(1)) ex(n,H)}$ such graphs. For
bipartite graphs, however, much less is known: even the weaker bound
$2^{O(ex(n,H))}$ has been proven in only a few special cases: for cycles of
length four and six, and for some complete bipartite graphs.
  For even cycles, Bondy and Simonovits proved in the 1970s that ex$(n,C_{2l})
= O( n^{1 + 1/l} )$, and this bound is conjectured to be sharp up to the
implicit constant. In this paper we prove that the number of $C_{2l}$-free
graphs on $n$ vertices is at most $2^{O(n^{1 + 1/l})}$, confirming a conjecture
of Erd\H{o}s. Our proof uses the hypergraph container method, which was
developed recently (and independently) by Balogh, Morris and Samotij, and by
Saxton and Thomason, together with a new 'balanced supersaturation theorem' for
even cycles. We moreover show that there are at least $2^{(1 + c)ex(n,C_6)}$
$C_6$-free graphs on $n$ vertices for some $c > 0$ and infinitely many values
of $n$, disproving a well-known and natural conjecture. As a further
application of our method, we essentially resolve the so-called Tur\'an problem
on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $G(n,p)$ for both even cycles and
complete bipartite graphs.

framework of the VLT-FLAMES Tarantula Survey (VFTS), we aim to establish the
(projected) rotational velocity distribution for a sample of 216 presumably
single O-type stars in 30 Doradus (30 Dor).
  Methods. We measured projected rotational velocities, \vrot, by means of a
Fourier transform method and a profile fitting method applied on a set of
isolated spectral lines. We also used an iterative deconvolution procedure to
infer the probability density, $\rm{P(\veq)}$, of the equatorial rotational
velocity, \veq.
  Results. The distribution of \vrot\ shows a two-component structure: a peak
around 80 \kms\ and a high-velocity tail extending up to $\sim$600 \kms. This
structure is also present in the inferred distribution $\rm{P(\veq)}$ with
around 80% of the sample having 0 $<$ \veq\, $\leq\, 300$ \kms\ and the other
20% distributed in the high-velocity region.
  Conclusions. Most of the stars in our sample rotate with a rate less than
20%\ of their break-up velocity. For the bulk of the sample, mass-loss in a
stellar wind and/or envelope expansion is not efficient enough to significantly
spin down these stars within the first few Myr of evolution. The presence of a
sizeable population of fast rotators is compatible with recent population
synthesis computations that investigate the influence of binary evolution on
the rotation rate of massive stars. Despite the fact that we have excluded
stars that show significant radial velocity variations, our sample may have
remained contaminated by post-interaction binary products. The fact that the
high-velocity tail may be preferentially (and perhaps even exclusively),
populated by post-binary interaction products, has important implications for
the evolutionary origin of systems that produce gamma-ray bursts.

bow shocks around exoplanets. For hot Jupiters the bow shock will not form
directly between the planet and the star, causing an asymmetric distribution of
mass around the exoplanet and hence an asymmetric transit. As the planet orbits
thorough varying wind conditions, the strength and geometry of its bow shock
will change, thus producing transits of varying shape. We model this process
using magnetic maps of HD 189733 taken one year apart, coupled with a 3D
stellar wind model, to determine the local stellar wind conditions throughout
the orbital path of the planet. We predict the time-varying geometry and
density of the bow shock that forms around the magnetosphere of the planet and
simulate transit light curves. Depending on the nature of the stellar magnetic
field, and hence its wind, we find that both the transit duration and ingress
time can vary when compared to optical light curves. We conclude that
consecutive near-UV transit light curves may vary significantly and can
therefore provide an insight into the structure and evolution of the stellar
wind.

studies. We explore this issue by comparing a suite of Gadget-3 SPH simulations
of idealised (i.e., non-cosmological) isolated discs and galaxy mergers with
otherwise identical calculations performed using the moving-mesh code Arepo.
When black hole (BH) accretion and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback are
not included, the star formation histories (SFHs) obtained from the two codes
agree well. When BHs are included, the code- and resolution-dependent
variations in the SFHs are more significant, but the agreement is still good,
and the stellar mass formed over the course of a simulation is robust to
variations in the numerical method. During a merger, the gas morphology and
phase structure are initially similar prior to the starburst phase. However,
once a hot gaseous halo has formed from shock heating and AGN feedback (when
included), the agreement is less good. In particular, during the post-starburst
phase, the SPH simulations feature more prominent hot gaseous haloes and
spurious clumps, whereas with Arepo, gas clumps and filaments are less apparent
and the hot halo gas can cool more efficiently. We discuss the origin of these
differences and explain why the SPH technique yields trustworthy results for
some applications (such as the idealised isolated disc and galaxy merger
simulations presented here) but not others (e.g., gas flows onto galaxies in
cosmological hydrodynamical simulations).

this new 4.3-m facility. With Tempel 2 having been observed to exhibit a small
but ongoing spin-down in its rotation period for over two decades, our primary
goals at this time were two-fold. First, to determine its current rotation
period and compare it to that measured shortly after its most recent perihelion
passage in 2010, and second, to disentangle the spin-down from synodic effects
due to the solar day and the Earth's orbital motion and to determine the sense
of rotation, i.e. prograde or retrograde. At our midpoint of 2013 Feb 24, the
observed synodic period is 8.948+/-0.001 hr, exactly matching the predicted
prograde rotation solution based on 2010 results, and yields a sidereal period
of the identical value due to the solar and Earth synodic components just
canceling out during the interval of the 2013 observations. The retrograde
solution is ruled out because the associated sidereal periods in 2010 and 2013
are quite different even though we know that extremely little outgassing,
needed to produce torques, occurred in this interval. With a definitive sense
of rotation, the specific amounts of spin-down to the sidereal period could be
assessed. The nominal values imply that the rate of spin-down has decreased
over time, consistent with the secular drop in water production since 1988. Our
data also exhibited an unexpectedly small lightcurve amplitude which appears to
be associated with viewing from a large, negative sub-Earth latitude, and a
lightcurve shape deviating from a simple sinusoid implying a highly irregularly
shaped nucleus.

at high redshift, (iii) significantly reduce the galaxy formation efficiencies

a trend in agreement with observations. However, the low redshift (z<0.5) star
formation rates of massive galaxies are higher than observed (up to ten times).
No tested model predicts the observed size evolution for low-mass and high-mass
galaxies simultaneously. Due to the delayed onset of star formation in the wind
models, the metal enrichment of gas and stars is delayed and agrees well with
observational constraints. Metal cooling and stellar winds are both found to
increase the ratio of in situ formed to accreted stars - the relative
importance of dissipative vs. dissipationless assembly. For halo masses below
~10^12M_sun, this is mainly caused by less stellar accretion and compares well
to predictions from semi-analytical models but still differs from abundance
matching models. For higher masses, the fraction of in situ stars is
over-predicted due to the unrealistically high star formation rates at low
redshifts.

how the massive cluster perturbs the motion of the structures from the Hubble

obtaining sufficient baryon asymmetry. Two example models of direct

towards the mini-split scale of $\sim$ 100-1000 TeV for the sfermion masses.

the Universe, but are inevitably limited by systematic uncertainties. Imperfect
photometric calibration leads to biases in our measurements of the density
fields of LSS tracers such as galaxies and quasars, and as a result in
cosmological parameter estimation. Earlier studies have proposed using
cross-correlations between different redshift slices or cross-correlations
between different surveys to reduce the effects of such systematics. In this
paper we develop a method to characterize unknown systematics. We demonstrate
that while we do not have sufficient information to correct for unknown
systematics in the data, we can obtain an estimate of their magnitude. We
define a parameter to estimate contamination from unknown systematics using
cross-correlations between different redshift slices and propose discarding
bins in the angular power spectrum that lie outside a certain contamination
tolerance level. We show that this method improves estimates of the bias using
simulated data and further apply it to photometric luminous red galaxies in the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey as a case study.

wormhole and black hole solutions of an f(R) type theory which have two
asymptotically AdS regions and are completely free of curvature singularities.
While there is a delta-function source for the dilaton, classical string probes
are not sensitive to this singularity. If the AdS/CFT correspondence can be
applied in this context, then the wormhole background describes a phase in
which two copies of a conformal field theory interact with each other, whereas
the nonsingular black hole describes entangled states. By studying the behavior
of open strings on these backgrounds, we extract a number of features of the
quarks and anti-quarks that live in the field theories. In the interacting
phase, we find that there is a maximum speed with which the quarks can move
without losing energy, beyond which energy is transferred from a quark in one
field theory to a quark in the other. We also compute the rate at which moving
quarks within entangled states lose energy to the two surrounding plasmas.
While a quark-antiquark pair within a single field theory exhibits Coulomb
interaction for small separation, a quark in one field theory exhibits
spring-like confinement with an anti-quark in the other field theory. For the
entangled states, we study how the quark-antiquark screening length depends on
temperature and chemical potential. In the interacting phase of the two field
theories, a quadruplet made up of one quark-antiquark pair in each field theory
can undergo transitions involving how the quarks and antiquarks are paired in
terms of the screening.

grid points away from each black hole to keep the overall problem size at a
practical level. In this respect, our system can be thought of as a ""double""
version of the fisheye coordinate system, used before in numerical relativity
codes for evolving binary black holes. The gridding scheme is constructed as a
mapping between a uniform coordinate system--in which the equations of motion
are solved--to the distorted system representing the spatial locations of our

circumbinary disc calculations, we demonstrate how the distorted system can be
constructed to asymptote to the typical spherical polar coordinate system,
amenable to efficiently simulating orbiting gas flows about central objects
with little numerical diffusion. We discuss its implementation in the Harm3d

select an initial ""seed"" set from the network such that the entire network
adopts any behavior given to the seed. Here we introduce a method for quickly
finding seed sets that scales to very large networks. Our approach finds a set
of nodes that guarantees spreading to the entire network under the tipping
model. After experimentally evaluating 31 real-world networks, we found that
our approach often finds seed sets that are several orders of magnitude smaller
than the population size and outperform nodal centrality measures in most
cases. In addition, our approach scales well - on a Friendster social network
consisting of 5.6 million nodes and 28 million edges we found a seed set in
under 3.6 hours. Our experiments also indicate that our algorithm provides
small seed sets even if high-degree nodes are removed. Lastly, we find that
highly clustered local neighborhoods, together with dense network-wide
community structures, suppress a trend's ability to spread under the tipping
model.

branches, flatten their bodies and undulate through the air to produce a glide.
The shape of their body cross-section during the glide plays an important role
in generating lift. This paper presents a computational investigation of the
aerodynamics of the cross-sectional shape. Two-dimensional simulations of
incompressible flow past the anatomically correct cross-section of the species
Chrysopelea paradisi show that a significant enhancement in lift appears at a
35-degrees angle of attack, above Reynolds numbers 2000. Previous experiments
on physical models also obtained an increased lift, at the same angle of
attack. The flow is inherently three-dimensional in physical experiments, due
to fluid instabilities, and it is thus intriguing that the enhanced lift also
appears in the two-dimensional simulations. The simulations point to the lift
enhancement arising from the early separation of the boundary layer on the
dorsal surface of the snake profile, without stall. The separated shear layer
rolls up and interacts with secondary vorticity in the near-wake, inducing the
primary vortex to remain closer to the body and thus cause enhanced suction,
resulting in higher lift.

galaxy (Sgr), we conclude that the alpha-element deficiencies cannot be due to
the Type Ia supernova (SNIa) time-delay scenario of Tinsley (1979). Instead,
the evidence points to low [alpha/Fe] ratios resulting from an initial mass
function (IMF) deficient in the highest mass stars. The critical evidence is
the 0.4 dex deficiency of [O/Fe], [Mg/Fe] and other hydrostatic elements,
contrasting with the normal trend of r-process [Eu/Fe]r with [Fe/H]. Supporting
evidence comes from the hydrostatic element (O, Mg, Na, Al, Cu) [X/Fe] ratios,
which are inconsistent with iron added to the Milky Way (MW) disk trends. Also,
the ratio of hydrostatic to explosive (Si, Ca, Ti) element abundances suggests
a relatively top-light IMF. Abundance similarities with the LMC, Fornax and IC
1613, suggest that their alpha-element deficiencies also resulted from IMFs
lacking the most massive SNII.
  For such a top-light IMF, the normal trend of r-process [Eu/Fe]r with [Fe/H],
as seen in Sgr, indicates that massive Type II supernovae (>30Msun) cannot be
major sources of r-process elements.
  High [La/Y] ratios, consistent with leaky-box chemical evolution, are
confirmed but ~0.3 dex larger than theoretical AGB predictions. This may be due
to the 13C pocket mass, or a difference between MW and Sgr AGB stars. Sgr has
the lowest [Rb/Zr] ratios known, consistent with low-mass (~2Msun) AGB stars
near [Fe/H]=-0.6, likely resulting from leaky-box chemical evolution.
  The [Cu/O] trend in Sgr and the MW suggest that Cu yields increase with both
metallicity and stellar mass, as expected from Cu production by the weak
s-process in massive stars.
  Finally, we present an updated hfs line list, an abundance analysis of
Arcturus, and further develop our error analysis formalism.

probabilistic data structure, a Count-Min Sketch. The Count-Min Sketch permits
online updating and retrieval of k-mer counts in memory which is necessary to
support online k-mer analysis algorithms. On sparse data sets this data
structure is considerably more memory efficient than any exact data structure.
In exchange, the use of a Count-Min Sketch introduces a systematic overcount
for k-mers; moreover, only the counts, and not the k-mers, are stored. Here we
analyze the speed, the memory usage, and the miscount rate of khmer for
generating k-mer frequency distributions and retrieving k-mer counts for
individual k-mers. We also compare the performance of khmer to several other
k-mer counting packages, including Tallymer, Jellyfish, BFCounter, DSK, KMC,
Turtle and KAnalyze. Finally, we examine the effectiveness of profiling
sequencing error, k-mer abundance trimming, and digital normalization of reads

resulting unequal electronic occupations of these orbitals provide a powerful
lever over electron density and spin ordering in metal oxides. Here, we show
how to dynamically modulate the orbital populations on Mn atoms at
ferroelectric/manganite interfaces by switching the ferroelectric polarization.
The change in orbital occupation can be as large as 10\%, greatly exceeding
that of bulk manganites. This flippable orbital splitting is in large part
controlled by the propagation of ferroelectric polar displacements into the
interfacial region, a structural motif absent in the bulk and unique to the
interface. We use {\it ab initio} theory, epitaxial thin film growth, and
scanning transmission electron microscopy to verify the predicted interfacial
polar state and concomitant orbital splittings.

  Phenotypes in Genome-wide Association Studies",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Principal Component analysis (PCA) is a useful statistical technique that is
commonly used for multivariate analysis of correlated variables. It is usually
applied as a dimension reduction method: the top principal components (PCs)
explaining most of total variance are tested for association with a predictor
of interest, and the remaining PCs are ignored. This strategy has been widely
applied in genetic epidemiology, however some of its aspects are not well
appreciated in the context of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
association testing. In this study, we review the theoretical basis of PCA and
its behavior when testing for association between a SNP and two correlated
traits under various scenarios. We then evaluate with simulations the power of
several different PCA-based strategies when analyzing up to 100 correlated
traits. We show that contrary to widespread practice that testing the top PCs
only can be dramatically underpowered since PCs explaining a low amount of the
total phenotypic variance can harbor substantial genetic associations.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that PC-based strategies that use all PCs have
great potential to detect negatively pleiotropic genetic variants (e.g.
variants with opposite effects on positively correlated traits) and genetic
variants that are exclusively associated with a single trait, but only achieve
a moderate gain in power to detect positive pleiotropic genetic loci. Finally,
the genome-wide association study of five correlated coagulation traits in 685
subjects from the MARTHA study confirms these results. The joint analysis of
the five PCs from the coagulation traits identified two new candidate SNPs,
which were most strongly associated with the 5th PC that explained the smallest
amount of phenotypic variance.

rather high value of the Higgs mass, has sharpened the perception that
supersymmetric model parameter space is highly electroweak fine-tuned (EWFT).
We compare three measures of fine-tuning in SUSY models. 1. \Del_HS measures a
terms containing large log contributions to m_Z that are inevitable in models
defined at scales much higher than the electroweak scale. 2. \Del_BG measures
variation in m_Z against variation of model parameters and allows for
correlations among high scale parameters which are not included in \Del_HS. 3.
The model-independent \Del_EW measures how naturally a model can generate the
measured value of m_Z=91.2 GeV in terms of weak scale parameters alone. We
hypothesize an overarching Ultimate Theory (UTH) wherein the high scale soft
terms are all correlated. The UTH might be contained within the more general
effective SUSY theories popular in the literature. For \Del_HS, EWFT can be
overestimated by neglecting additional non-independent terms which lead to
large cancellations. For \Del_BG, EWFT can be overestimated by applying the
measure to the effective theories instead of to the UTH. The measure \Del_EW
allows for the possibility of parameter correlations which should be present in
the UTH and, since it is model-independent, provides the same value of EWFT for
the effective theories as should occur for the UTH. We find that the well-known
mSUGRA/CMSSM model is fine-tuned under all three measures so that it is
unlikely to contain the UTH. The non-universal Higgs model NUHM2 appears
fine-tuned with \Del_HS,BG > 10^3. But since \Del_EW can be as small as 7
(corresponding to 14% fine-tuning), it may contain the UTH for parameter ranges
which allow for low true EWFT.

the ""Higgs portal"" coupling while $\nu$ at the tree level interacts only with
$\varphi$ through Yukawa interactions. The relic abundance of $\nu$ and
$\varphi$ is found by solving the Boltzmann equations numerically; for the case
$m_\nu > m_\varphi$ we also derive a reliable approximate analytical solution.
Effects of the interaction between the two DM components are discussed. A scan
over the parameter space is performed to determine the regions consistent with
the WMAP data for DM relic abundance, and with the XENON100 direct detection
limits for the DM-nucleus cross section. We find that although a large region
of the parameter space is allowed by the WMAP constraints, the XENON100 data
severely restricts the parameter space. Taking into account only amplitudes
generated at the tree level one finds three allowed regions for the scalar

design variable for engineering assemblies with targeted structure and
properties. In particular, a number of polyhedral nanoparticles have been shown
to exhibit a rich phase behavior [Agarwal et al., Nature Materials, 2011, 10,
230]. Since real synthesized particles have polydispersity not only in size but
also in shape, we explore here the phase behavior of binary mixtures of hard
convex polyhedra having similar sizes but different shapes. Choosing
representative particle shapes from those readily synthesizable, we study in
particular four mixtures: (i) cubes and spheres (with spheres providing a
non-polyhedral reference case), (ii) cubes and truncated octahedra, (iii) cubes
and cuboctahedra, and (iv) cuboctahedra and truncated octahedra. The phase
behavior of such mixtures is dependent on the interplay of mixing and packing
entropy, which can give rise to miscible or phase-separated states. The extent
of mixing of two such particle types is expected to depend on the degree of
shape similarity, relative sizes, composition, and compatibility of the crystal
structures formed by the pure components. While expectedly the binary systems
studied exhibit phase separation at high pressures due to the incompatible
pure-component crystal structures, our study shows that the essential
qualitative trends in miscibility and phase separation can be correlated to
properties of the pure components, such as the relative values of the
order-disorder transition pressure (ODP) of each component. Specifically, if
for a mixture A+B we have that ODP_B <ODP_A and \Delta ODP = ODP_A - ODP_B,
then at any particular pressure where phase separation occurs, the larger the
\Delta ODP the lower the solubility of A in the B-rich ordered phase and the
higher the solubility of B in the A-rich ordered phase.

percolation theory, directly and without modification to reactive solute
transport. This theory has previously been shown to predict the observed range
of dispersivity values for conservative solute transport over ten orders of
magnitude of length scale. We now show that the temporal dependence derived for
the solute velocity accurately predicts the time-dependence for the weathering
of silicate minerals over nine orders of magnitude of time scale, while its
predicted length dependence agrees with data obtained for reaction rates over
five orders of magnitude of length scale. In both cases, it is possible to
unify lab and field results. Thus, net reaction rates appear to be limited by
solute transport velocities. We suggest the possible relevance of our results
to landscape evolution of the earth's terrestrial surface.

a tail, i.e. a non-zero support inside the light cone, which in turn implies
that the Huygens' principle is violated. However, the reason behind this
behavior is still not quite clear. In this paper we shed more light on the
physical origin of the tail by regularizing the term which is usually ignored
in the literature since it vanishes due to the action of the delta function.
With this extra term the Green's function does not satisfy the source-free wave
equation (in the region outside of the source). We show that this term
corresponds to a charge imprinted on the light cone shell. Unlike the vector
field charge, a moving scalar field charge is not Lorentz invariant and is
contracted by the relativistic $\sqrt{1-v^2}$ factor. If a scalar charge is
moving at the speed of light, it appears to be zero in the static (with respect
to the original physical charge) observer's frame. However, the field it
sources is not entirely on the light cone. Thus, it is likely that this hidden
charge sources the mysterious tail in odd dimensions.

by the Lupus molecular cloud complex are used to determine the properties of
the grains and the composition of the ices before they are incorporated into
circumstellar envelopes and disks. H2O ices form at extinctions of
Ak=0.25+/-0.07 mag (Av=2.1+/-0.6). Such a low ice formation threshold is
consistent with the absence of nearby hot stars. Overall, the Lupus clouds are
in an early chemical phase. The abundance of H2O ice (2.3+/-0.1*10^-5 relative
to Nh) is typical for quiescent regions, but lower by a factor of 3-4 compared
to dense envelopes of YSOs. The low solid CH3OH abundance (<3-8% relative to
H2O) indicates a low gas phase H/CO ratio, which is consistent with the
observed incomplete CO freeze out. Furthermore it is found that the grains in
Lupus experienced growth by coagulation. The mid-infrared (>5 um) continuum
extinction relative to Ak increases as a function of Ak. Most Lupus lines of
sight are well fitted with empirically derived extinction curves corresponding
to Rv~ 3.5 (Ak=0.71) and Rv~5.0 (Ak=1.47). For lines of sight with Ak>1.0 mag,
the tau9.7/Ak ratio is a factor of 2 lower compared to the diffuse medium.
Below 1.0 mag, values scatter between the dense and diffuse medium ratios. The
absence of a gradual transition between diffuse and dense medium-type dust
indicates that local conditions matter in the process that sets the tau9.7/Ak
ratio. This process is likely related to grain growth by coagulation, as traced
by the A7.4/Ak continuum extinction ratio, but not to ice mantle formation.
Conversely, grains acquire ice mantles before the process of coagulation
starts.

  Relaxation, Global Optimality and Robust Optimization","Applied mathematics report UNSW, to appear in Mathematical
  Programming",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The trust-region problem, which minimizes a nonconvex quadratic function over
a ball, is a key subproblem in trust-region methods for solving nonlinear
optimization problems. It enjoys many attractive properties such as an exact
semi-definite linear programming relaxation (SDP relaxation) and strong
duality. Unfortunately, such properties do not, in general, hold for an
extended trust-region problem having extra linear constraints. This paper shows
that two useful and powerful features of the classical trust-region problem
continue to hold for an extended trust-region problem with linear inequality
constraints under a new dimension condition. First, we establish that the class
of extended trust-region problems has an exact SDP-relaxation, which holds
without the Slater constraint qualification. This is achieved by proving that a
system of quadratic and affine functions involved in the model satisfies a
range-convexity whenever the dimension condition is fulfilled. Second, we show
that the dimension condition together with the Slater condition ensures that a
set of combined first and second-order Lagrange multiplier conditions is
necessary and sufficient for global optimality of the extended trust-region
problem and consequently for strong duality. Finally, we show that the
dimension condition is easily satisfied for the extended trust-region model
that arises from the reformulation of a robust least squares problem (LSP) as
well as a robust second order cone programming model problem (SOCP) as an
equivalent semi-definite linear programming problem. This leads us to conclude
that, under mild assumptions, solving a robust (LSP) or (SOCP) under
matrix-norm uncertainty or polyhedral uncertainty is equivalent to solving a
SDP and so, their solutions can be validated in polynomial time.

PS1-11af, which was also detected by GALEX with coordinated observations in the
near-ultraviolet (NUV) band. PS1-11af is associated with the nucleus of an
early-type galaxy at redshift z=0.4046 that exhibits no evidence for star
formation or AGN activity. Four epochs of spectroscopy reveal a pair of
transient broad absorption features in the UV on otherwise featureless spectra.
Despite the superficial similarity of these features to P-Cygni absorptions of
supernovae (SNe), we conclude that PS1-11af is not consistent with the
properties of known types of SNe. Blackbody fits to the spectral energy
distribution are inconsistent with the cooling, expanding ejecta of a SN, and
the velocities of the absorption features are too high to represent material in
homologous expansion near a SN photosphere. However, the constant blue colors
and slow evolution of the luminosity are similar to previous optically-selected
tidal disruption events (TDEs). The shape of the optical light curve is
consistent with models for TDEs, but the minimum accreted mass necessary to
power the observed luminosity is only ~0.002M_sun, which points to a partial
disruption model. A full disruption model predicts higher bolometric
luminosities, which would require most of the radiation to be emitted in a
separate component at high energies where we lack observations. In addition,
the observed temperature is lower than that predicted by pure accretion disk
models for TDEs and requires reprocessing to a constant, lower temperature.

been found that the fundamental harmonic spectrum from the electron radiation
exhibits distinctive fringes, which is dependent not only upon the internucleus

to explain these effects in terms of interference among the electron scattering

folding of the spine and fan. A non-zero component of current parallel to the
fan is required such that the null's fan plane and spine are not perpendicular.
Our aims are to provide valid magnetohydrostatic equilibria and to describe the
current accumulations in various cases involving finite plasma pressure.To
create our equilibrium current structures we use a full, non-resistive,
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code so that no reconnection is allowed. A series of
experiments are performed in which a perturbed 3D tilted null relaxes towards
an equilibrium via real, viscous damping forces. Changes to the initial plasma
pressure and to magnetic parameters are investigated systematically.An
initially tilted fan is associated with a non-zero Lorentz force that drives
the fan and spine to collapse towards each other, in a similar manner to the
collapse of a 2D X-point. In the final equilibrium state for an initially
radial null with only the current perpendicular to the spine, the current
concentrates along the tilt axis of the fan and in a layer about the null point
with a sharp peak at the null itself. The continued growth of this peak
indicates that the system is in an asymptotic regime involving an infinite time
singularity at the null. When the initial tilt disturbance (current
perpendicular to the spine) is combined with a spiral-type disturbance (current
parallel to the spine), the final current density concentrates in three
regions: one on the fan along its tilt axis and two around the spine, above and
below the fan. The increased area of current accumulation leads to a weakening
of the singularity formed at the null. The 3D spine-fan collapse with generic
current studied here provides the ideal setup for non-steady reconnection
studies.

pattern is characterized by its particle-density correlation function $G_\rho$,
the density correlation function $G_c$ of trajectory centers, and an order

scattering. To resolve this enigma, we investigate the disorder effects of
nonmagnetic Zn impurities in the strong (unitary) scattering limit on various
properties of the system in the $s_{\pm}$-wave superconducting pairing state.
The lattice Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation (BdG) is solved self-consistently
based on a minimal two-orbital model with an extended range of impurity
concentrations. We find that Zn impurity is best modeled as a defect, where
charge is mainly localized, but scattering is extended over a few lattice
sites. With increasing Zn concentration the density of states shows a gradual
filling of the gap, revealing the impurity-induced pair breaking effect.
Moreover, both the disorder configuration-averaged superconducting order
parameter and the superfluid density are dramatically suppressed towards the
dirty limit, indicating the violation of the Anderson theorem for conventional
s-wave superconductors and the breakdown of the Abrikosov-Gorkov theory for
impurity-averaged Green's functions. Furthermore, we find that the
superconducting phase is fully suppressed close to the critical impurity
concentration of roughly $n_\text{imp}\approx 10%$, in agreement with recent
experiments.

establishing that damaged fragments are charged species, or polarizable. Hence,
the decay and recovery process should be controllable with the applications of

sensitive to an applied electric field, which drastically affects the decay and
recovery dynamics. We demonstrate accelerated recovery when one field polarity

chess problems. They are particularly significant in composition tournaments.
Examples include, not having any check in the first move of the solution and
not dressing up the board with unnecessary pieces. Conventions are often
associated or even directly conflated with the overall aesthetics or beauty of
a composition. Using an existing experimentally-validated computational
aesthetics model for three-move mate problems, we analyzed sets of
computer-generated compositions adhering to at least 2, 3 and 4 comparable
conventions to test if simply conforming to more conventions had a positive
effect on their aesthetics, as is generally believed by human composers. We
found slight but statistically significant evidence that it does, but only to a
point. We also analyzed human judge scores of 145 three-move mate problems
composed by humans to see if they had any positive correlation with the
computational aesthetic scores of those problems. We found that they did not.
These seemingly conflicting findings suggest two main things. First, the right
amount of adherence to composition conventions in a composition has a positive
effect on its perceived aesthetics. Second, human judges either do not look at
the same conventions related to aesthetics in the model used or emphasize
others that have less to do with beauty as perceived by the majority of
players, even though they may mistakenly consider their judgements beautiful in
the traditional, non-esoteric sense. Human judges may also be relying
significantly on personal tastes as we found no correlation between their
individual scores either.

structure and evolution of the most massive stars by focusing on a large
ensemble of stars in a carefully selected young open cluster. Cluster
asteroseismology of very young stars such as those of NGC2244 has the major
advantage that all cluster stars have similar age, distance and initial
chemical composition, implying drastic restrictions for the stellar modeling
compared to asteroseismology of single isolated stars with very different ages
and metallicities.
  Our study requires long-term photometric measurements of stars with visual
magnitude ranging from 6.5 to 15 in a large FoV with a precision better than 30
ppm for the brightest cluster members (magnitude below 9) up to 500 ppm for the
fainter ones, which is well achievable with 2-Wheel Kepler, in combination with
high-precision high-resolution spectroscopy and spectro-polarimetry of the
brightest pulsating cluster members. These ground-based spectroscopic data will

Delivered reliability is the reliability of using the software after it is
delivered to the users. Usually the software consists of many modules. Thus,
the delivered reliability is dependent on the operational profile which
specifies how the users will use these modules as well as the defect number
remaining in each module. Therefore, a good testing policy should take the
operational profile into account and dynamically select tested modules
according to the current state of the software during the testing process. This
paper discusses how to dynamically select tested modules in order to maximize
delivered reliability by formulating the selection problem as a dynamic
programming problem. As the testing process is performed only once, risk must
be considered during the testing process, which is described by the tester's
utility function in this paper. Besides, since usually the tester has no
accurate estimate of the operational profile, by employing robust optimization
technique, we analysis the selection problem in the worst case, given the
uncertainty set of operational profile. By numerical examples, we show the
necessity of maximizing delivered reliability directly and using robust
optimization technique when the tester has no clear idea of the operational
profile. Moreover, it is shown that the risk averse behavior of the tester has
a major influence on the delivered reliability.

lattice in the limit of strong anisotropy; the model is mapped onto an
effective Ising-type model, where elementary excitations consist of closed
loops of flipped Ising-type variables. Analyzing this effective model by Monte
Carlo simulation, we find a phase transition from quantum spin liquid to
paramagnet at a finite critical temperature $T_c$. We also compute the magnetic
properties in terms of the original quantum spins. We find that the magnetic
susceptibility exhibits a broad hump above $T_c$, while it obeys the Curie law
at high $T$ and approaches a nonzero Van Vleck-type constant at low $T$.
Although the susceptibility changes continuously at $T_c$, its $T$ derivative
shows critical divergence at $T_c$. We also clarify that the dynamical spin
correlation function is momentum independent but shows quantized peaks
corresponding to the discretized excitations. Although the phase transition
accompanies no apparent symmetry breaking in terms of the Ising-type variables
as well as the original quantum spins, we characterize it from a topological
viewpoint. We find that, by defining the flux density for loops of the
Ising-type variables, the transition is interpreted as the one occurring from
the zero-flux quantum spin liquid to the nonzero-flux paramagnet; the latter
has a Coulombic nature due to the local constraints. The role of global
constraints on the Ising-type variables is examined in comparison with the
results in the two-dimensional loop model. A correspondence of our model to the
Ising model on a diamond lattice is also discussed. A possible relevance of our
results to the recently-discovered hyperhoneycomb compound,

time-homogeneous substitution processes. Motivated by computational
convenience, this assumption sacrifices biological realism and offers little
opportunity to uncover the temporal dynamics in evolutionary histories. Here,
we extend and generalize an evolutionary approach that relaxes the
time-homogeneous process assumption by allowing the specification of different
infinitesimal substitution rate matrices across different time intervals,
called epochs, along the evolutionary history. We focus on an epoch model
implementation in a Bayesian inference framework that offers great modeling
flexibility in drawing inference about any discrete data type characterized as
a continuous-time Markov chain, including phylogeographic traits. To alleviate
the computational burden that the additional temporal heterogeneity imposes, we
adopt a massively parallel approach that achieves both fine- and coarse-grain
parallelization of the computations across branches that accommodate epoch
transitions, making extensive use of graphics processing units. Through
synthetic examples, we assess model performance in recovering evolutionary
parameters from data generated according to different evolutionary scenarios
that comprise different numbers of epochs for both nucleotide and codon
substitution processes. We illustrate the usefulness of our inference framework
in two different applications to empirical data sets: the selection dynamics on
within-host HIV populations throughout infection and the seasonality of global
influenza circulation. In both cases, our epoch model captures key features of
temporal heterogeneity that remained difficult to test using ad hoc procedures.

high degree of coherence and strong nonlinearities, thanks to their hybrid
light-matter character. In their condensed form, they display striking quantum
hydrodynamic features analogous to atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, such as
long-range order coherence, superfluidity and quantized vorticity. Their
variegated dispersive and dissipative properties, however, set significant
differences from their atomic counterpart. In this work, we report the unique
phenomenology that is observed when a pulse of light impacts the polariton
vacuum: the condensate that is instantaneously formed does not splash in real
space but instead coheres into an enigmatic structure, featuring concentric
rings and, most notably, a sharp and bright peak at the center. Using a
state-of-the-art ultrafast imaging with 50 fs time steps, we are able to track
the dynamics of the polariton mean-field wavefunction in both real and
reciprocal space. The observation of the real-space collapse of the condensate
into an extremely localized---resolution limited---peak is at odd with the
repulsive interactions of polaritons and their positive effective mass. An
unconventional mechanism is therefore at play to account for our observations.
Our modeling suggests that self-trapping due to a local heating of the crystal
lattice---that can be described as a collective polaron formed by a polariton
condensate---could be involved. These observations hint at the fascinating
fluid dynamics of polaritons in conditions of extreme intensities and ultrafast
times.

somewhat more flexible approach is considered. Given a set of convex symmetric
key surfaces which correspond to different hardening stages, the form of the

experimentally observed sequence of symmetric convex yield surfaces can be
rendered. In particular, an arbitrary sharpening of the yield locus in the

quality of the system. Round Robin algorithm performs optimally in time shared
systems, but it performs more number of context switches, larger waiting time
and larger response time. In order to simulate the behavior of various CPU
scheduling algorithms and to improve Round Robin scheduling algorithm using
dynamic time slice concept, in this paper we produce the implementation of new
CPU scheduling algorithm called An Optimum Multilevel Dynamic Round Robin
Scheduling (OMDRRS), which calculates intelligent time slice and warps after
every round of execution. The results display the robustness of this software,
especially for academic, research and experimental use, as well as proving the
desirability and efficiency of the probabilistic algorithm over the other
existing techniques and it is observed that this OMDRRS projects good

modulation, we can also observe the spontaneous noise reflecting the coherence
between the hyperfine levels in the excited state. There are two in novel
components in the measurement system, the noise reduction scheme and the
stabilization of the laser system. The noise reduction mechanism can be used to
reduce the shot noise contribution to arbitrarily low levels through averaging,
in principle. This is combined with differential detection to keep unwanted
noise at low levels. The laser system is stabilized to obtain spectral width
below 1\,kHz without high frequency ($\gtrsim10\,$MHz) noise. These methods are
described systematically and the performance of the asurement system is

was used for a single-crystal study of a star-shaped Fe3Cr single-molecule
magnet (SMM) with crystallographically imposed trigonal symmetry. The high
resolution and sensitivity accessible with W-band EPR allowed us to determine
accurately the axial zero-field splitting terms for the ground (S =6) and first
two excited states (S =5 and S =4). Furthermore, spectra recorded by applying
the magnetic field perpendicular to the trigonal axis showed a pi/6 angular
modulation. This behavior is a signature of the presence of trigonal transverse
magnetic anisotropy terms whose values had not been spectroscopically
determined in any SMM prior to this work. Such in-plane anisotropy could only
be justified by dropping the so-called 'giant spin approach' and by considering
a complete multispin approach. From a detailed analysis of experimental data
with the two models, it emerged that the observed trigonal anisotropy directly
reflects the structural features of the cluster, i.e., the relative orientation
of single-ion anisotropy tensors and the angular modulation of single-ion
anisotropy components in the hard plane of the cluster. Finally, since
high-order transverse anisotropy is pivotal in determining the spin dynamics in
the quantum tunneling regime, we have compared the angular dependence of the
tunnel splitting predicted by the two models upon application of a transverse
field (Berry-phase interference).

useful representations from samples of a dataset in an unsupervised fashion.
They have been widely employed as an unsupervised pre-training method in
machine learning. RBMs have been modified to model time series in two main
ways: The Temporal RBM stacks a number of RBMs laterally and introduces
temporal dependencies between the hidden layer units; The Conditional RBM, on
the other hand, considers past samples of the dataset as a conditional bias and
learns a representation which takes these into account. Here we propose a new
training method for both the TRBM and the CRBM, which enforces the dynamic
structure of temporal datasets. We do so by treating the temporal models as
denoising autoencoders, considering past frames of the dataset as corrupted
versions of the present frame and minimizing the reconstruction error of the
present data by the model. We call this approach Temporal Autoencoding. This
leads to a significant improvement in the performance of both models in a
filling-in-frames task across a number of datasets. The error reduction for
motion capture data is 56\% for the CRBM and 80\% for the TRBM. Taking the
posterior mean prediction instead of single samples further improves the
model's estimates, decreasing the error by as much as 91\% for the CRBM on
motion capture data. We also trained the model to perform forecasting on a
large number of datasets and have found TA pretraining to consistently improve
the performance of the forecasts. Furthermore, by looking at the prediction
error across time, we can see that this improvement reflects a better
representation of the dynamics of the data as opposed to a bias towards
reconstructing the observed data on a short time scale.

Earth's atmosphere as a calorimeter. Much of the calibration of Cherenkov
telescope experiments is done using Monte Carlo simulations of the air shower
development, Cherenkov radiation and detector, assuming certain models for the
atmospheric conditions. Any deviation of the real conditions during
observations from the assumed atmospheric model will result in a wrong
reconstruction of the primary gamma-ray energy and the resulting source
spectra. During eight years of observations, the High Energy Stereoscopic
System (H.E.S.S.) has experienced periodic natural as well as anthropogenic
variations of the atmospheric transparency due to aerosols created by biomass
burning.
  In order to identify data that have been taken under such long-term
reductions in atmospheric transparency, a new monitoring quantity, the
Cherenkov transparency coefficient, has been developed and will be presented
here. This quantity is independent of hardware changes in the detector and,
therefore, isolates atmospheric factors that can impact the performance of the
instrument, and in particular the spectral results. Its positive correlation

detailed analysis of the full catalogue of over 800 F ring mini-jets, examining
their distribution, morphology and lifetimes in order to place constraints on
the underlying moonlet population. We find mini-jets randomly located in
longitude around the ring, with little correlation to the moon Prometheus, and
randomly distributed in time, over the full Cassini tour to date. They have a
tendency to cluster together, forming complicated `multiple' structures, and
have typical lifetimes of ~1d. Repeated observations of some features show
significant evolution, including the creation of new mini-jets, implying
repeated collisions by the same object. This suggests a population of <~1km
radius objects with some internal strength and orbits spread over 100km in
semi-major axis relative to the F ring but with the majority within 20km. These
objects likely formed in the ring under, and were subsequently scattered onto
differing orbits by, the perturbing action of Prometheus. This reinforces the
idea of the F ring as a region with a complex balance between collisions,
disruption and accretion.

Whether the conversion occurs depend on the fraction of hydrogenated

fixed the number of bound states supported by the potential curve, so that the

for all measured isotopic combinations. Such a model enables an accurate
prediction of the s-wave scattering lengths of all isotopic combinations of the
RbYb system. The reduced mass range is broad enough to cover the full
scattering lengths range from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$. For example, the
$^{87}$Rb$^{174}$Yb system is characterized by a large positive scattering
length of $+880(120)$~a.u., while $^{87}$Rb$^{173}$Yb has $a=-626(88)$~a.u.. On
the other hand $^{87}$Rb$^{170}$Yb has a very small scattering length of
$-14.5(1.8)$~a.u. confirmed by the pair's extremely low thermalization rate.

scattering lengths is much smoother ranging from $+39.0(1.6)$ a.u. for
$^{85}$Rb$^{176}$Yb to $+230(10)$ a.u. in the case of $^{85}$Rb$^{168}$Yb.
Hyperfine corrections to these scattering lengths are also given. We further
complement the fitted potential with interaction parameters calculated from
alternative methods. The recommended value of the van der Waals coefficient is

interact. However, recent evidence suggests that: globular clusters passing
through the disk may be able to perturb giant molecular clouds (GMCs)
triggering formation of open clusters and some old open clusters may be linked
to accreted globulars. Here, we further explore the existence of possible
dynamical connections between globular and open clusters, and realize that the
most obvious link must be in the form of gravitational interactions. If open
clusters are born out of GMCs, they have to move in similar orbits. If we
accept that globulars can interact with GMCs, triggering star formation, it
follows that globular and open clusters must also interact. Consistently,
theoretical arguments as well as observational evidence, show that globular and
open clusters certainly are interacting populations and their interactions are
far more common than usually thought, especially for objects part of the
bulge/disk. Monte Carlo calculations confirm that conclusion. Globular clusters
seem capable of not only inducing formation of open clusters but, more often,
their demise. Relatively frequent high speed cluster encounters or cluster
harassment may also cause, on the long-term, slow erosion and tidal truncation
on the globulars involved. The disputed object FSR 1767 (2MASS-GC04) may be,
statistically speaking, the best example of an ongoing interaction.

the phonon scattering which usually blocks heat transfer. For weak linearly
coupled interface, the nonlinearity can enhance the interfacial thermal
transport; with increasing nonlinearity or temperature, the thermal conductance
shows nonmonotonical behavior. The interfacial nonlinearity also induces
thermal rectification, which depends on the mismatch of the two leads and also
the interfacial linear coupling.

positive radial gradient, varying between 15--47 mag over the projected

photoconversion efficiency of tandem solar cells (SCs) and applied it to SCs
with both vertical and lateral designs at AM0 and AM1.5 conditions. To get the
maximum efficiency, only radiative recombination has been considered using
typical radiative recombination parameters of the direct band gap III-V
semiconductors, and explicit energy dependence of light absorption. When
simulating the efficiency, we selfconsistently took into account the fact that
the amount of the heat dissipated by SC decreases as the number of
current-matched sub-cells increases. As the operating SCs temperature decreases
both the open-circuit voltage and the photoconversion efficiency increase. It
is shown that the above effect is especially strong for SCs operating under AM0
conditions. As the number of subcells is increased, narrowing the spectral
range for each subcell, the photocurrent is additionally reduced due to the
energy dependent light absorption, the factor generally ignored in the standard
approaches. Application of our formalism results in a maximum in the
theoretical dependence of the efficiency on the number of subcells, which was
indeed observed experimentally. Besides agreement with experiment, our
theoretical results are also close to other efficiencies calculated using
detailed balance based approaches.

interstitial atom. We predict the stabilities for 14H and 18R LPSO structures
for many Mg-XL-XS ternary systems: 85 systems consisting of XL=rare earths (RE)
Sc,Y,La-Lu and XS=Zn,Al,Cu,Co,Ni. We predict thermodynamically stable LPSO
phases in all systems where LPSO structures are observed. In addition, we
predict several stable LPSO structures in new, as-yet-unobserved Mg-RE-XS
systems. Many non-RE XL elements are also explored on the basis of size
mismatch between Mg and XL, including Tl,Sb,Pb,Na,Te,Bi,Pa,Ca,Th,K,Sr --- an
additional 55 ternary systems. XL=Ca, Sr, and Th are predicted to be most
promising to form stable LPSO phases, particularly with XS=Zn. Lastly, several
previously observed trends amongst known XL elements are examined. We find that
favorable mixing energy between Mg and XL on the FCC lattice and the size
mismatch together serve as excellent criteria determining XL LPSO formation.

systems can be studied through both dynamical systems theory and Hamiltonian

wide variety of spatio-temporal systems. There are, however, fewer results on
higher-dimensional Hamiltonian systems with symmetry. This lack of results has
lead us to investigate the role of symmetry, in particular dihedral symmetry,
on high-dimensional coupled Hamiltonian systems. As a representative example,
we consider the model equations of a ring of vibratory gyroscopes. The
equations are reformulated in a Hamiltonian structure and the corresponding
normal forms are derived. Through a normal form analysis, we investigated the
effects of various coupling schemes and unraveled the nature of the

propose a scoring method built on strictly proper scoring rules to induce

scores based on pairwise comparisons between the reports made by each pair of

Under the assumptions that reviewers are Bayesian decision-makers and that they
cannot influence the reviews of other reviewers, we show that risk-neutral
reviewers strictly maximize their expected scores by honestly disclosing their

as a function of doping near the critical point where superconductivity is
suppressed in the overdoped regime. Our IR data thus provide bulk specific

entanglement, and read-out. Here, we report direct measurement of pure spin
transport - free of any charge motion - within a nanoscale quasi 1D 'spin

fluctuations of a small number of spins ($\sqrt{N}$ < 100 net spins) which are

transport proceeds by means of magnetic dipole interactions that induce
flip-flop transitions, a mechanism that can enable highly efficient, even
reversible, pure spin currents. To further study the dynamics within the spin
wire, we implement a magnetic resonance protocol that improves spatial
resolution and provides nanoscale spectroscopic information which confirms the
observed spin transport. This spectroscopic tool opens a potential route for

We will use the quadratic rank transmutation map (QRTM) in order to generate a
flexible family of probability distributions taking generalized inverse Weibull
distribution as the base value distribution by introducing a new parameter that
would offer more distributional flexibility. Various structural properties
including explicit expressions for the mo- ments, quantiles, and moment
generating function of the new dis- tribution are derived.We proposed the
method of maximum likelihood for estimating the model parameters and obtain the
observed information matrix. A real data set are used to compare the exibility
of the transmuted version versus the generalized inverseWeibull distribution.

$F(T)$ gravity in the limit of high dissipation. The inflationary expansion is
driven by the scalar inflaton while the gravitational dynamics follow from the
$F(T)$ gravity. We calculate the relevant inflationary observables such as
scalar-tensor ratio, power-spectrum indices of density perturbations and
gravitational waves and the e-folding parameter. We obtain a ratio of slow-roll
parameters to be constant. Our calculations support the warm-intermediate
inflationary scenario in a spacetime with torsion. Moreover our results are
compatible with the astrophysical observations of cosmic microwave background
and Planck data.

part because acquired characteristics are passed on through horizontal
exchange. It has been proposed that culture, like life, began with the
emergence of autopoietic form, thus its evolution too cannot be described by
natural selection. The evolution of autopoietic form can be described using a
framework referred to as Context-driven Actualization of Potential (CAP), which
grew out of a generalization of the formalisms of quantum mechanics, and
encompasses nondeterministic as well as deterministic change of state. The
autopoietic structure that evolves through culture is the mind, or more
accurately the conceptual network that yields an individual's internal model of
the world. A branch of CAP research referred to as the state-context-property
(SCOP) formalism provides a mathematical framework for reconciling the
stability of conceptual structure with its susceptibility to context-driven
change. The combination of two or more concepts (an extreme case of contextual
influence), as occurs in insight, is modeled as a state of entanglement.
Theoretical and empirical findings are presented that challenge assumptions
underlying virtually all of cognitive science, such as the notion of spreading
activation and the assumption that cognitive processes can be described with a
Kolmogorovian probability model.

ascertain properties of its environment. A large number of experiments have
since exploited the Brownian motion of colloidal particles for studies of
dissipative processes, providing insight into soft matter physics, and leading
to applications from energy harvesting to medical imaging. Here we use
optically levitated nanospheres that are heated to investigate the
non-equilibrium properties of the gas surrounding them. Analysing the sphere's
Brownian motion allows us to determine the temperature of the centre-of-mass
motion of the sphere, its surface temperature and the heated gas temperature in
two spatial dimensions. We observe asymmetric heating of the sphere and gas,
with temperatures reaching the melting point of the material. This method
offers new opportunities for accurate temperature measurements with spatial
resolution on the nanoscale, and a new means for testing non-equilibrium
thermodynamics

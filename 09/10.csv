under an SU(2) gauge field in the bulk. In this model, the s-wave and p-wave
condensates can be consistently realized. We find that there are totally four
phases in this model, namely, the normal phase without any condensate, s-wave
phase, p-wave phase and the s+p coexisting phase. By calculating Gibbs free
energy, the s+p coexisting phase turns out to be thermodynamically favored once
it can appear. The phase diagram with the dimension of the scalar operator and
temperature is drawn. The temperature range for the s+p coexisting phase is
very narrow, which shows the competition between the s-wave and p-wave orders
in the superconductor model.

while together with Carri\'on and Dadarlat we showed that most wreath products
fail to have strongly quasidiagonal C*-algebras. These two results raised the
question of whether or not strong quasidiagonality could characterize virtual
nilpotence among finitely generated groups. The purpose of this note is to
provide examples of finitely generated groups (in fact of the form $\Z^3\rtimes
\Z^2$) that are not virtually nilpotent yet have strongly quasidiagonal
C*-algebras. Moreover we show these examples are the ""simplest"" possible by
proving that a group of the form $\Z^d\rtimes \Z$ is virtually nilpotent if and
only if its group C*-algebra is strongly quasidiagonal.

processes involved to quench the star formation are still unclear. By studying
the individual star formation histories of the bulges and disks of lenticulars,
it is possible to look for clues to the processes that triggered their
transformation from spirals. To accomplish this feat, we present a new method
for spectroscopic bulge-disk decomposition, in which a long-slit spectrum is
decomposed into two one-dimensional spectra representing purely the bulge and
disk light. We present preliminary results from applying this method to
lenticular galaxies in the Virgo and Fornax Clusters, in which we show that the
most recent star formation activity in these galaxies occurred within the
bulges. We also find that the bulges are in general more Fe-enriched than the
disks of the same galaxy, and that this enrichment grows stronger as the age of
the bulge becomes younger. These results point towards a scenario where the
star formation in the disks of spiral galaxies are quenched, followed by a
burst of star formation in the central regions from the gas that has been
funnelled inwards through the disk.

as well as routing. Noncooperation is still a big challenge that certainly
degrades the performance and reliability of a MANET. This paper presents a
novel methodology to overcome routing misbehavior in MANET using Retaliation
Model. In this model node misbehavior is watched and an equivalent misbehavior
is given in return. This model employs several parameters such as number of
packets forwarded, number of packets received for forwarding, packet forwarding
ratio etc. to calculate Grade and Bonus Points. The Grade is used to isolate
selfish nodes from the routing paths and the Bonus Points defines the number of
packets dropped by an honest node in retaliation over its misconducts. The
implementation is done in ""GloMoSim"" on top of the DSR protocol. We obtained up
to 40% packet delivery ratio with a cost of a minimum of 7.5% overhead compared
to DSR. To minimize total control traffic overhead we have included the FG
Model with our model and it reduces the overhead up to 75%. This model enforces
cooperation due to its stricter punishment strategy and justifies its name.

different simulations with the axis of the second CME rotated by 90 degrees

performed in three dimensions (3-D) with the Space Weather Modeling Framework
(SWMF) in an idealized setting reminiscent of solar minimum conditions. We
extract synthetic satellite measurements during and after the interaction and
compare the different cases. We also analyze the kinematics of the two CMEs,
including the evolution of their widths and aspect ratios. We find that the
first CME contracts radially as a result of the interaction in all cases, but
the amount of subsequent radial expansion depends on the relative orientation
of the two CMEs. Reconnection between the two ejecta and between the ejecta and
the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) determines the type of structure
resulting from the interaction. When a CME with a high inclination with respect
to the ecliptic overtakes one with a low inclination, it is possible to create
a compound event with a smooth rotation in the magnetic field vector over more
than 180 degrees. Due to reconnection, the second CME only appears as an
extended ""tail"", and the event may be mistaken for a glancing encounter with an
isolated CME. This configuration differs significantly from the one usually
studied of a multiple-magnetic cloud event, which we found to be associated
with the interaction of two CMEs with the same orientation.

$\||u|^{p(x)}\|_{L^1(\Omega)}^{p_{max}-p_{min}}$. Dependence of the constant on

the tuning methods developed at CesrTA to achieve low-emittance conditions. One
iteration of beam-based measurement and correction requires about 10 minutes. A
minimum vertical emittance of 10.3 +3.2/-3.4(sys) +/-0.2(stat) pm has been

dominated by beam position monitor systematics. The propagation of
uncertainties in the emittance measurement is described in detail. Simulations
modeling the effects of magnet misalignments, BPM errors, and emittance

errors, multipole errors and misalignments. This method, developed and tested
at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring Test Accelerator (CesrTA), has been
applied to the damping ring lattice for the International Linear Collider
(ILC). The effectiveness of beam based emittance tuning is limited by beam
position monitor (BPM) measurement errors, number of corrector magnets and
their placement, and correction algorithm. The specifications for damping ring
magnet alignment, multipole errors, number of BPMs, and precision in BPM
measurements are shown to be consistent with the required emittances and
dynamic aperture. The methodology is then used to determine the minimum number
of position monitors that is required to achieve the emittance targets, and how
that minimum depends on the location of the BPMs. Similarly, the maximum
tolerable multipole errors are evaluated. Finally, the robustness of each BPM
configuration with respect to random failures is explored.

block mirror descent (SBMD) method for solving large-scale nonsmooth and

incorporate the block-coordinate decomposition and an incremental block
averaging scheme into the classic (stochastic) mirror-descent method, in order
to significantly reduce the cost per iteration of the latter algorithm. We
establish the rate of convergence of the SBMD method along with its associated
large-deviation results for solving general nonsmooth and stochastic
optimization problems. We also introduce different variants of this method and
establish their rate of convergence for solving strongly convex, smooth, and
composite optimization problems, as well as certain nonconvex optimization
problems. To the best of our knowledge, all these developments related to the
SBMD methods are new in the stochastic optimization literature. Moreover, some
of our results also seem to be new for block coordinate descent methods for
deterministic optimization.

the initial circulation of ring-shaped Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) can be
probed by time-of-flight (TOF) images. We have studied theoretically the
dynamics of a BEC after release from a toroidal trap potential by solving the
3D Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation. The trap and condensate characteristics
matched those of a recent experiment. The circulation, experimentally imparted
to the condensate by stirring, was simulated theoretically by imprinting a
linear azimuthal phase on the initial condensate wave function. The theoretical
TOF images were in good agreement with the experimental data. We find that upon
release the dynamics of the ring--shaped condensate proceeds in two distinct
phases. First, the condensate expands rapidly inward, filling in the initial
hole until it reaches a minimum radius that depends on the initial circulation.
In the second phase, the density at the inner radius increases to a maximum
after which the hole radius begins slowly to expand. During this second phase a
series of concentric rings appears due to the interference of ingoing and
outgoing matter waves from the inner radius. The results of the GP equation
predict that the hole area is a quadratic function of the initial circulation
when the condensate is released directly from the trap in which it was stirred
and is a linear function of the circulation if the trap is relaxed before
release. These scalings matched the data. Thus, hole size after TOF can be used
as a reliable probe of initial condensate circulation. This connection between
circulation and hole size after TOF will facilitate future studies of
atomtronic systems that are implemented in ultracold quantum gases.

excitation and pumping models. We find that many v=1 J=1-0 and v=2 J=1-0

v=2 J=1-0 emission is primarily located within several v=1 J=1-0 regions, and
has a high degree of morphological similarity in the northeastern envelope,
supportive of local collisional pumping. We find significantly higher spatial
overlap between v=1 J=1-0 and J=2-1 features than generally previously
reported. However, the overlapping v=1 J=2-1 emission is usually weaker than
predicted by hydrodynamical models, possibly due to low-density collisional
pumping. The overall maser morphology contains several large-scale features
that are persistent over multiple years and are likely associated with
intrinsic physical circumstellar conditions. Our data cannot distinguish
between competing near-circumstellar bulk kinematic models but do provide
evidence for localized inhomogeneous mass-loss.

aptly described through a large-deviations functional. The finite-size scaling

Turning to site percolation on Z^2, where the self duality does not hold

true in this case. The proof uses appropriate finite size criteria and a result
of Kesten which allows us to extend existing crossings without losing too much

object in this short paper is twofold. Our first goal is to give a proof of a

a celebrated result by Kesten on the so called ""box crossing"", our second goal
in this paper is to present a self-contained proof of this theorem in perhaps a

as a tool to generate the numerically exact dynamics of non-Markovian open

remains a serious challenge due to the need for a deep hierarchy that arises
from the Matsubara expansion of the bath correlation function. Here we present
a hybrid stochastic hierarchical equation of motion (sHEOM) approach that
alleviates this bottleneck and leads to a numerical cost that is nearly
independent of temperature. Additionally, the sHEOM method generally converges
with fewer hierarchy tiers allowing for the treatment of larger systems.
Benchmark calculations are presented on the dynamics of two level systems at
both high and low temperatures to demonstrate the efficacy of the approach.
Then the hybrid method is used to generate the exact dynamics of systems that
are nearly impossible to treat by the standard hierarchy. First, exact energy
transfer rates are calculated across a broad range of temperatures revealing
the deviations from the Forster rates. This is followed by computations of the
entanglement dynamics in a system of two qubits at low temperature spanning the

present a higher clustering signal than unobscured sources. Since the host
galaxy morphologies of obscured AGN are not typical red sequence elliptical
galaxies and show disks in many cases, it is unlikely that the increased
clustering strength of the obscured population is driven by a host galaxy
segregation bias. By using relatively complete redshift distributions from the
COSMOS survey, we find obscured sources at mean redshift z=0.9 have a bias of b

merger-remnant galaxies are informative tracers of galaxy evolution, but the
avenue for identifying them in large numbers for such studies is not yet clear.
One promising approach is to target spectroscopic signatures of systems where
both SMBHs are fueled as dual active galactic nuclei (AGNs), or where one SMBH
is fueled as an offset AGN. Dual AGNs may produce double-peaked narrow AGN
emission lines, while offset AGNs may produce single-peaked narrow AGN emission
lines with line-of-sight velocity offsets relative to the host galaxy. We
search for such dual and offset systems among 173 Type 2 AGNs at z<0.37 in the
AGN and Galaxy Evolution Survey (AGES), and we find two double-peaked AGNs and
five offset AGN candidates. When we compare these results to a similar search
of the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey and match the two samples in color,
absolute magnitude, and minimum velocity offset, we find that the fraction of
AGNs that are dual SMBH candidates increases from z=0.25 to z=0.7 by a factor
of ~6 (from 2/70 to 16/91, or 2.9% to 18%). This may be associated with the
rise in the galaxy merger fraction over the same cosmic time. As further
evidence for a link with galaxy mergers, the AGES offset and dual AGN
candidates are tentatively ~3 times more likely than the overall AGN population
to reside in a host galaxy that has a companion galaxy (from 16/173 to 2/7, or
9% to 29%). Follow-up observations of the seven offset and dual AGN candidates
in AGES will definitively distinguish velocity offsets produced by dual SMBHs
from those produced by narrow-line region kinematics, and will help sharpen our
observational approach to detecting dual SMBHs.

pixelization in a more accurate and computationally efficient manner. We
calculate precisely the magnitude of the systematic bias in the power spectrum
inferred from the partial sky, and show that aberration shifts the multipole
moment by Delta L/L ~ beta<cos(theta)>, with <cos(theta)> averaged over the
survey footprint. Such a shift, if ignored, would bias the measurement of the
sound-horizon size theta_* at the 0.01%-level, which is comparable to the
measurement uncertainties of Planck. The bias can then propagate into
cosmological parameters such as the angular-diameter distance, Hubble parameter
and dark-energy equation of state. We study the effect of aberration for

the comet's response to such a close passage by the Sun is important for
planning observational campaigns and for inferring ISON's physical properties.
We present new numerical simulations and interpret them in context with the
historical track record of comet disruptions and of sungrazing comet behavior.
Historical data suggest that sizes below ~200 m are susceptible to destruction
by sublimation driven mass loss, while we find that for ISON's perihelion
distance, densities lower than 0.1 g cm^-3 are required to tidally disrupt a
retrograde or non-spinning body. Such low densities are substantially below the
range of the best-determined comet nucleus densities, though dynamically new
comets such as ISON have few measurements of physical properties. Disruption
may occur for prograde rotation at densities up to 0.7 g cm^-3, with the
chances of disruption increasing for lower density, faster prograde rotation,
and increasing elongation of the nucleus. Given current constraints on ISON's
nucleus properties and the typically determined values for these properties
among all comets, we find tidal disruption to be unlikely unless other factors
(e.g., spin-up via torquing) affect ISON substantially. Whether or not
disruption occurs, the largest remnant must be big enough to survive subsequent
mass loss due to sublimation in order for ISON to remain a viable comet well
after perihelion.

neutron stars, white dwarfs and WDM galaxies. Compact dwarf galaxies follow
from the quantum degenerate regime, while dilute and large galaxies from the

these theoretical scaling relations. For the compact dwarfs, our results show
small deviations from the scaling due to quantum macroscopic effects. We

stars. It is generally agreed that wide-angled protostellar outflows come from
the interaction between the wind from a forming star and the ambient gas.
However, it is still unclear how the interaction takes place. In this work, we
theoretically investigate the possibility that the outflow results from
interaction between the wind and the ambient gas in the form of turbulent
entrainment. In contrast to the previous models, turbulent motion of the
ambient gas around the protostar is taken into account. In our model, the
ram-pressure of the wind balances the turbulent ram-pressure of the ambient
gas, and the outflow consists of the ambient gas entrained by the wind. The
calculated outflow from our modelling exhibits a conical shape. The total mass
of the outflow is determined by the turbulent velocity of the envelope as well
as the outflow age, and the velocity of the outflow is several times higher
than the velocity dispersion of the ambient gas. The outflow opening angle
increases with the strength of the wind and decreases with the increasing
ambient gas turbulence. The outflow exhibits a broad line width at every
position. We propose that the turbulent entrainment process, which happens
ubiquitously in nature, plays a universal role in shaping protostellar
outflows.

cosmic history and determine the prospects for intensity mapping of spatial
fluctuations in the Ly-alpha signal. Since i) our model assumes at z>6 the
minimum star formation required to sustain reionization and ii) is based at z<6
on a luminosity function extrapolated from the few observed bright Ly-alpha
emitters, this should be considered a lower limit. Mapping the line emission
allows probes of reionization, star formation, and large-scale structure (LSS)
as a function of redshift. While Ly-alpha emission during reionization has been
studied, we also predict the post-reionization signal to test predictions of
the intensity and motivate future intensity mapping probes of reionization. We
include emission from massive dark matter halos and the intergalactic medium
(IGM) in our model. We find agreement with current, measured luminosity
functions of Ly-alpha emitters at z<8. However, diffuse IGM emission, not
associated with Ly-alpha emitters, dominates the intensity up to z~10. While
our model is applicable for deep-optical or near-infrared observers like the
SuMIre survey or the James Webb Space Telescope, only intensity mapping will
detect the diffuse IGM emission. We also construct a 3D power spectrum model of
the Ly\alpha emission, and characterize possible foreground contamination.
Finally, we study the prospects of an intensity mapper for measuring Ly-alpha
fluctuations while identifying interloper contamination for removal. Our
results suggest that while the reionization signal is challenging, Ly-alpha
fluctuations can be an interesting new probe of LSS at late times when used in
conjunction with other lines like, e.g., H-alpha, to monitor low-redshift
foreground confusion.

than crude estimates of when the Universe's first stars and black holes form.
In contrast to previous work, which has focused on predicting the 21-cm
signatures of the first luminous objects, we investigate an arbitrary
realization of the signal, and attempt to translate its features to the
physical properties of the IGM. Within a simplified global framework, the 21-cm
signal yields quantitative constraints on the Lyman-alpha background intensity,
net heat deposition, ionized fraction, and their time derivatives, without
invoking models for the astrophysical sources themselves. The 21-cm absorption
signal is most easily interpreted, setting strong limits on the heating rate
density of the Universe with a measurement of its redshift alone, independent
of the ionization history or details of the Lyman-alpha background evolution.
In a companion paper we extend these results, focusing on the confidence with
which one can infer source emissivities from IGM properties.

black holes (SMBHs) had already formed when the Universe was < 0.9 Gyr old. One
hypothesis for the origins of these SMBHs is that they grew from the remnants
of the first generation of massive stars, which formed in low-mass (~ 10^5 to
10^6 Msol) dark matter minihaloes at z > 20. This is the regime where baryonic
streaming motions--the relative velocities of baryons with respect to dark
matter in the early Universe--most strongly inhibit star formation by
suppressing gas infall and cooling. We investigate the impact of this effect on
the growth of the first SMBHs using a suite of high-fidelity,
ellipsoidal-collapse Monte Carlo merger-tree simulations. We find that the
suppression of seed BH formation by the streaming motions significantly reduces
the number density of the most massive BHs at z > 15, but the residual effect
at lower redshifts is essentially negligible. The streaming motions can reduce
by a factor of few the number density of the most luminous quasars at z ~
10-11, where such objects could be detected by the James Webb Space Telescope.
We conclude, with minor theoretical caveats, that baryonic streaming motions
are unlikely to pose a significant additional obstacle to the formation of the
observed high-redshift quasar SMBHs. Nor do they appreciably affect the heating

host galaxies of such binaries are themselves expected to be also very massive
and rare, so that out to redshifts z~2 a unique massive galaxy may be
identified as the host. At higher redshifts, the PTA error boxes are larger and
may contain as many as several hundred massive-galaxy interlopers. In this
case, the true counterpart may be identified, if it is accreting gas
efficiently, as an active galactic nucleus (AGN) with a peculiar spectrum and
variable emission features. Specifically, the binary's tidal torques expel the
gas from the inner part of the accretion disk, making it unusually dim in X-ray
and UV bands and in broad optical emission lines. The tails of the broad wings
of any FeK-alpha emission line may also be `clipped' and missing. The binary's
orbital motion, as well as the gas motions it induces, may trigger
quasiperiodic variations. These include coherent flux variability, such as
luminous, multi-wavelength flares, as well as Doppler shifts of broad emission
lines and `see-saw' oscillations in the FeK-alpha line. Additional features,
such as evidence for a recent major merger or dual collimated jets, could also
corroborate the counterpart. These properties would make resolved PTA sources

(2012)], introduced a new approach to quantum cluster embedding methods,
whereby the mapping of strongly correlated bulk problems to an impurity with
finite set of bath states was rigorously formulated to exactly reproduce the
entanglement of the ground state. The formalism provided similar physics to
dynamical mean-field theory at a tiny fraction of the cost, but was inherently
limited by the construction of a bath designed to reproduce ground state,
static properties. Here, we generalize the concept of quantum embedding to
dynamic properties and demonstrate accurate bulk spectral functions at
similarly small computational cost. The proposed spectral DMET utilizes the
Schmidt decomposition of a response vector, mapping the bulk dynamic
correlation functions to that of a quantum impurity cluster coupled to a set of
frequency dependent bath states. The resultant spectral functions are obtained
on the real-frequency axis, without bath discretization error, and allows for
the construction of arbitrary dynamic correlation functions. We demonstrate the
method on the 1D and 2D Hubbard model, where we obtain zero temperature,
thermodynamic limit spectral functions, and show the trivial extension to
two-particle Green functions. This advance therefore extends the scope and
applicability of DMET in condensed matter problems as a computationally
tractable route to correlated spectral functions of extended systems, and
provides a competitive alternative to dynamical mean-field theory for dynamic
quantities.

by presenting first-epoch images from VLBA monitoring of ten newer TeV HBLs.
All ten sources were successfully detected and imaged, and all showed a
one-sided core-jet structure. Many display a morphology common to TeV HBLs: a
short, collimated jet followed by a transition to low surface brightness
extended emission with a much broader opening angle. The newly detected TeV
HBLs tend to be fainter in the radio; the median core flux density was 22 mJy,
and the median brightness temperature was 8x10^9 K. The brightness temperatures
are well below the equipartition limit, and thus the VLBI cores do not require
strong beaming, consistent with the modest values of Doppler and Lorentz
factors found in the VLBI jets of TeV HBLs by other studies, and contrasting
with the strong beaming generally required by the TeV emission. We study the
full sample of TeV HBLs that have been observed with VLBI, and find a
correlation between TeV flux and VLBI core brightness temperature, suggesting
different but correlated beaming factors for the TeV and radio emission. We
present a discussion of these observations in the context of velocity
structures in the jets of the TeV HBLs.

balance between the locality-aware, but explicit, message-passing model and the
easy-to-use, but locality-agnostic, shared memory model. However, the PGAS rich
memory model comes at a performance cost which can hinder its potential for
scalability and performance. To contain this overhead and achieve full
performance, compiler optimizations may not be sufficient and manual
optimizations are typically added. This, however, can severely limit the
productivity advantage. Such optimizations are usually targeted at reducing
address translation overheads for shared data structures. This paper proposes a
hardware architectural support for PGAS, which allows the processor to
efficiently handle shared addresses. This eliminates the need for such
hand-tuning, while maintaining the performance and productivity of PGAS
languages. We propose to avail this hardware support to compilers by
introducing new instructions to efficiently access and traverse the PGAS memory
space. A prototype compiler is realized by extending the Berkeley Unified
Parallel C (UPC) compiler. It allows unmodified code to use the new
instructions without the user intervention, thereby creating a real productive
programming environment. Two implementations are realized: the first is
implemented using the full system simulator Gem5, which allows the evaluation
of the performance gain. The second is implemented using a softcore processor
Leon3 on an FPGA to verify the implementability and to parameterize the cost of
the new hardware and its instructions. The new instructions show promising
results for the NAS Parallel Benchmarks implemented in UPC. A speedup of up to
5.5x is demonstrated for unmodified and unoptimized codes. Unoptimized code
performance using this hardware was shown to also surpass the performance of
manually optimized code by up to 10%.

fraction of sources not associated with such structures. We find that these two
populations (on and off the identified filaments) have distinctly different
mass distributions. The mass distribution of the sources on the filaments is
found to peak at 4 Solar masses and drives the shape of the CMF at higher
masses, which we fit with a power law of the form dN/dlogM \propto
M^{-1.4+/-0.4}. The mass distribution of the sources off the filaments, on the
other hand, peaks at 0.8 Solar masses and leads to a flattening of the CMF at
masses lower than ~4 Solar masses. We postulate that this difference between
the mass distributions is due to the higher proportion of gas that is available
in the filaments, rather than in the diffuse cloud.

sensor networks by introducing a key agreement scheme in which sensor nodes
create secure radio connections with their neighbours depending on the aid of
third parties. These third parties are responsible only for the pair-wise key
establishment among sensor nodes, so they do not observe the physical
phenomenon nor route data packets to other nodes. The proposed method is
explained here with respect to four important issues: how secret shares are
distributed, how local neighbours are discovered, how legitimate third parties
are verified, and how secure channels are established. Moreover, the
performance of the scheme is analyzed with regards to five metrics: local
connectivity, resistance to node capture, memory usage, communication overhead,
and computational burden. Our scheme not only secures the transmission channels
of nodes but also guarantees high local connectivity of the sensor network, low
usage of memory resources, perfect network resilience against node capture, and
complete prevention against impersonation attacks. As it is demonstrated in
this paper, using a number of third parties equals to 10% of the total number
of sensor nodes in the area of interest, the proposed method can achieve at
least 99.42% local connectivity with a very low usage of available storage
resources (less than 385 bits on each sensor node).

photoemission excited with circularly polarized X-rays around the Fe L3
absorption edge. When the photon energy is swept through the Fe 2p-3d
resonance, the valence band spectra are strongly modified in terms of absolute
and relative peak intensities, degree of spin-polarization and light
polarization dependence. New peaks in the spin-polarized spectra are identified
as spin-flip transitions induced by exchange decay of spin-mixed core-holes. By
comparison with single atom and band structure data, it is shown that both
intra-atomic and multiple scattering effects strongly influence the spectra. We
show how the different features linked to states of different orbital symmetry
in the d band are differently enhanced by the resonant effect. The appearance
and origin of circular dichroism and spin polarization are analyzed for
different geometries of light incidence and electron emission direction,

This translation has previously been implemented as the EventB2Jml tool. We
adopted a taking our own medicine approach in the formalisation of our proof so
that Event-B as well as JML are formalised in Event-B and the proof is

obtained by applying EventB2Jml to the substitution, we prove that the

one color on almost all of either the even or the odd sub-torus. In particular,
one color appears on nearly half of the torus sites. This model is the zero
temperature case of the $3$-state anti-ferromagnetic Potts model from
statistical physics.
  Our work extends previously obtained results for the discrete torus with
specific boundary conditions. The main challenge in this extension is to
overcome certain topological obstructions which appear when no boundary
conditions are imposed on the model. Locally, a proper $3$-coloring defines the
discrete gradient of an integer-valued height function which changes by exactly
one between adjacent sites. However, these locally-defined functions do not
always yield a height function on the entire torus, as the gradients may
accumulate to a non-zero quantity when winding around the torus. Our main
result is that in high dimensions, a global height function is well defined
with high probability, allowing to deduce the rigid structure of the coloring
from previously known results. Moreover, the probability that the gradients
accumulate to a vector $m$, corresponding to the winding in each of the $d$
directions, is at most exponentially small in the product of $\|m\|_\infty$ and
the area of a cross-section of the torus.
  In the course of the proof we develop discrete analogues of notions from
algebraic topology. This theory is developed in some generality and may be of
use in the study of other models.

spectrum concepts, we develop several non-asymptotic inner bounds on channel
coding rates over the Gaussian MAC with a given finite blocklength, positive

corners.
  A main emphasis of the paper is to provide a new perspective on the procedure
of handling input cost constraints for tight achievability proofs. Contrary to
the complicated achievability techniques in the literature, we show that with a
proper choice of input distribution, tight bounds can be achieved via the
standard random coding argument and a modified typicality decoding. In
particular, we prove that codebooks generated randomly according to independent
uniform distributions on the respective ""power shells"" perform far better than

with power control. Interestingly, analogous to an error exponent result of
Gallager, the resulting achievable region lies roughly halfway between that of
the i.i.d. Gaussian inputs and that of a hypothetical ""sum-power shell"" input.
However, dealing with such a non-i.i.d. input requires additional analysis such
as a new change of measure technique and application of a Berry-Esseen CLT for
functions of random variables.

a viscous fluid with nematic directional order, in which momentum diffusivity
is anisotropic and which opposes resistance to bending. Specifically, we
provide closed-form analytical expressions for the response function, i.e. the
equivalent to Stokes's drag formula for nematic fluids. Particular attention is
given to the rotationally pseudo-isotropic condition defined by zero resistance
to bending, and to the strain pseudo-isotropic condition defined by isotropic
momentum diffusivity. We find the former to be consistent with the rheology of
biopolymer networks and the latter to be closer to the rheology of nematic
liquid crystals. These ""pure"" anisotropic conditions are used to benchmark
existing particle tracking microrheology methods that provide effective
directional viscosities by applying Stokes's drag law separately in different
directions. We find that the effective viscosity approach is phenomenologically
justified in rotationally isotropic fluids, although it leads to significant
errors in the estimated viscosity coefficients. On the other hand, the mere
concept of directional effective viscosities is found to be misleading in
fluids that oppose an appreciable resistance to bending. Finally, we observe
that anisotropic momentum diffusivity leads to asymmetric streamline patterns
displaying enhanced (reduced) streamline deflection in the directions of lower
(higher) diffusivity. The bending resistance of the fluid is found to modulate
the asymmetry of streamline deflection. In some cases, the combined effects of
both anisotropy mechanisms leads to streamline patterns that converge towards
the sphere.

in the disorder model is investigated. First, we explain the model and derive
an analytical expression of the effective waiting time for the general case. We
show that the exponent depends on the external field. Then we focus on a
one-dimensional system in order to illustrate the features of the anomalous
exponent. We derive approximate expressions of the anomalous exponent of the
system analytically. For the case of a weak field, the anomalous exponent is
consistent with that of diffusive systems. This is consistent with the
treatments of Barkai et al. [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 63}, 046118 (2001)] and our
result supports their theory. On the other hand, for the case of a strong field
and a strong disorder, the time evolution of the exponent clearly differs from
that in the weak field. The exponent is consistent with the well-known
expression of the anomalous exponent in the Multiple Trapping Model at
mesoscopic time scales. In the long time limit, a transition of the anomalous
exponent to the same value of the weak field occurs. For the case of a strong
field and a weak disorder, the exponent is equal to 1 and thus the diffusion is
normal. These findings are verified by the Monte Carlo simulation.

demonstrate that with high probability the convergence is exponentially fast

particular, the box-size dependence of the HFB calculations of weakly-bound
deformed nuclei are investigated, including the particle density and pairing
density distributions at nuclear surfaces, the near-threshold resonant and
continuum quasiparticle spectra, and energetic properties. The box size may
have larger influences in pairing properties than in other bulk properties. We
demonstrate that large-box calculations of weakly-bound nuclei are important to

Krull scheme (that is, a scheme which is locally a prime spectrum of a Krull
domain) with an action of a flat group scheme, study its basic properties, and
apply it to prove the finite generation of the class group of an invariant
subring.
  In particular, we prove the following.
  Let $k$ be a field, $G$ a smooth $k$-group scheme of finite type, and $X$ a
quasi-compact quasi-separated locally Krull $G$-scheme. Assume that there is a
$k$-scheme $Z$ of finite type and a dominating $k$-morphism $Z\rightarrow X$.
Let $\varphi:X\rightarrow Y$ be a $G$-invariant morphism such that $\mathcal
O_Y\rightarrow (\varphi_*\mathcal O_X)^G$ is an isomorphism. Then $Y$ is
locally Krull. If, moreover, $\Cl(X)$ is finitely generated, then $\Cl(G,X)$
and $\Cl(Y)$ are also finitely generated, where $\Cl(G,X)$ is the equivariant
class group.
  In fact, $\Cl(Y)$ is a subquotient of $\Cl(G,X)$. For actions of connected
group schemes on affine schemes, there are similar results of Magid and
Waterhouse, but our result also holds for disconnected $G$. The proof depends
on a similar result on (equivariant) Picard groups.

cycles on moduli spaces of pseudo-holomorphic curves which are not necessarily
cut out transversally. Such techniques have the potential for applications as
foundations for invariants in symplectic topology arising from ""counting""
pseudo-holomorphic curves. We introduce the notion of an *implicit atlas* on a
moduli space, which is (roughly) a convenient system of local
finite-dimensional reductions. We present a general intrinsic strategy for
constructing a canonical implicit atlas on any moduli space of
pseudo-holomorphic curves. The main technical step in applying this strategy in
any particular setting is to prove appropriate gluing theorems. We require only
topological gluing theorems, that is, smoothness of the transition maps between
gluing charts need not be addressed. Our approach to virtual fundamental cycles
is algebraic rather than geometric (in particular, we do not use perturbation).
Sheaf-theoretic tools play an important role in setting up our functorial
algebraic ""VFC package"". We illustrate the methods we introduce by giving
definitions of Gromov--Witten invariants and Hamiltonian Floer homology over
$\mathbb Q$ for general symplectic manifolds. Our framework generalizes to the
$S^1$-equivariant setting, and we use $S^1$-localization to calculate
Hamiltonian Floer homology. The Arnold conjecture (as treated by Floer,
Hofer--Salamon, Ono, Liu--Tian, Ruan, and Fukaya--Ono) is a well-known
corollary of this calculation.

significant time lags of several hundreds of seconds in the latter two

the island state, and a dominated positive correlation in the lower banana
state. Anti-correlations are presented at the upper banana state for the
outburst of 2010 and at the lower left banana states for the other two
outbursts. So far for atoll sources the cross-correlation has been studied
statistically only for 4U 1735-44, where anti-correlations showed up in the
upper banana state. Here our investigation upon 4U 1608-52 provides a similar
result in its 2010 outburst. In addition, we notice that the luminosities in
the upper banana of 1998 and 2002 outbursts are about 1.5 times that of 2010
outburst whose luminosity in the upper banana is close to that of 4U 1735-44.
The results suggest that the states in color-color diagram of a source could be
correlated with the luminosity of the source. A further spectral analysis shows
that, during the 2010 outburst, although an anti-correlation presents at the
highest fluxes, the contemporary spectrum is not the softest one along the
outburst evolution. This suggests that the observed anti-correlation may be
relevant to the transition between the hard and soft states, which is
consistent with the previous results on 4U 1735-44 and several black hole X-ray
binaries that anti-correlations are observed during the transition states.

However, many application such as simulations of brain networks, use
point-neurons --neurons without a morphological component-- as computational
units to keep the conceptual complexity and computational costs low.
Inevitably, these applications thus omit a fundamental property of neuronal
computation. In this work, we present an approach to model an artificial

simulate dendritic dynamics. The model synapse employs an analytic solution for

(SG) methods, the SAG method's iteration cost is independent of the number of
terms in the sum. However, by incorporating a memory of previous gradient
values the SAG method achieves a faster convergence rate than black-box SG
methods. The convergence rate is improved from O(1/k^{1/2}) to O(1/k) in
general, and when the sum is strongly-convex the convergence rate is improved
from the sub-linear O(1/k) to a linear convergence rate of the form O(p^k) for
p \textless{} 1. Further, in many cases the convergence rate of the new method
is also faster than black-box deterministic gradient methods, in terms of the
number of gradient evaluations. Numerical experiments indicate that the new
algorithm often dramatically outperforms existing SG and deterministic gradient
methods, and that the performance may be further improved through the use of
non-uniform sampling strategies.

monitoring the evolution, within mode-coupling theory, of a suitably defined
three-point function $\chi_C(t,t_w)$ with time $t$ and waiting time $t_w$. From
the complete wave vector-dependent equations of motion for domain growth we
pass to a schematic limit to obtain a numerically tractable form. We find that
the peak value $\chi_C^P$ of $\chi_C(t,t_w)$, which can be viewed as a
correlation volume, grows as $t_w^{0.5}$, and the relaxation time as
$t_w^{0.8}$, following a quench to a point deep in the glassy state. These
results constitute a theoretical explanation of the simulation findings of
Parisi [J. Phys. Chem. B {\bf 103}, 4128 (1999)] and Kob and Barrat [Phys. Rev.

hand, if the quench is to a point on the {\em liquid side}, the correlation
volume grows to saturation. We present a similar calculation for the growth
kinetics in a $p$-spin spin glass mean-field model where we find a slower
growth, $\chi_C^P \sim t_w^{0.13}$. Further, we show that a shear rate $\gdot$
cuts off the growth of glassy correlations when $t_w\sim 1/\gdot$ for quench in
the glassy regime and $t_w=\min(t_r,1/\gdot)$ in the liquid, where $t_r$ is the
relaxation time of the unsheared liquid. The relaxation time of the steady
state fluid in this case is $\propto \gdot^{-0.8}$.

key discovery at the core of meteorologist Ed Lorenz's work is the link between
space-time calculus and state-space fractal geometry. Indeed, properties of
Lorenz's fractal invariant set relate space-time calculus to deep areas of
mathematics such as G\""{o}del's Incompleteness Theorem. These properties,
combined with some recent developments in theoretical and observational
cosmology, motivate what is referred to as the `cosmological invariant set
postulate': that the universe $U$ can be considered a deterministic dynamical
system evolving on a causal measure-zero fractal invariant set $I_U$ in its
state space. Symbolic representations of $I_U$ are constructed explicitly based
on permutation representations of quaternions. The resulting `invariant set
theory' provides some new perspectives on determinism and causality in
fundamental physics. For example, whilst the cosmological invariant set appears
to have a rich enough structure to allow a description of quantum probability,
its measure-zero character ensures it is sparse enough to prevent invariant set
theory being constrained by the Bell inequality (consistent with a partial
violation of the so-called measurement independence postulate). The primacy of
geometry as embodied in the proposed theory extends the principles underpinning
general relativity. As a result, the physical basis for contemporary programmes
which apply standard field quantisation to some putative gravitational
lagrangian is questioned. Consistent with Penrose's suggestion of a
deterministic but non-computable theory of fundamental physics, a
`gravitational theory of the quantum' is proposed based on the geometry of
$I_U$, with potential observational consequences for the dark universe.

explosions. Owing to the entropy dependence of the Mn yield in explosive
thermonuclear burning, SNe Ia involving near Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs
(WDs) are predicted to produce Mn to Fe ratios significantly exceeding those of
SN Ia explosions involving sub-Chandrasekhar mass primary WDs. Of all current
supernova explosion models, only SN Ia models involving near-Chandrasekhar mass
WDs produce [Mn/Fe] > 0.0. Aims: Using the specific yields for competing SN Ia
scenarios, we aim to constrain the relative fractions of exploding
near-Chandrasekhar mass to sub-Chandrasekhar mass primary WDs in the Galaxy.
Methods: We extract the Mn yields from three-dimensional thermonuclear
supernova simulations referring to different initial setups and progenitor
channels. We then compute the chemical evolution of Mn in the Solar
neighborhood, assuming SNe Ia are made up of different relative fractions of
the considered explosion models. Results: We find that due to the entropy
dependence of freeze-out yields from nuclear statistical equilibrium, [Mn/Fe]
strongly depends on the mass of the exploding WD, with near-Chandraskher mass
WDs producing substantially higher [Mn/Fe] than sub-Chandrasekhar mass WDs. Of
all nucleosynthetic sources potentially influencing the chemical evolution of
Mn, only explosion models involving the thermonuclear incineration of
near-Chandrasekhar mass WDs predict solar or super-solar [Mn/Fe]. Consequently,
we find in our chemical evolution calculations that the observed [Mn/Fe] in the
Solar neighborhood at [Fe/H] > 0.0 cannot be reproduced without
near-Chandrasekhar mass SN Ia primaries. Assuming that 50 per cent of all SNe
Ia stem from explosive thermonuclear burning in near-Chandrasekhar mass WDs
results in a good match to data.

certificate for correctness and maximality of the solution. The method is
deployed for the analysis of the complete set of irreducible integer pools of

population dynamics in the spaces of nonnegative Radon measures with a suitable
metric provides a rigorous tool to study numerical schemes based on particle
methods. The approach is based on the idea of tracing growth and transport of
measures which approximate the solution of original partial differential
equation. In this paper we present analytical and numerical study of two
versions of Escalator Boxcar Train (EBT) algorithm which has been widely
applied in theoretical biology, and compare it to the recently developed
split-up algorithm. The novelty of this paper is in showing well-posedness and
convergence rates of the schemes using the concept of semiflows on metric
spaces. Theoretical results are validated by numerical simulations of test
cases, in which distances between simulated and exact solutions are computed
using flat metric.

multiplicatively approximable points in the plane. This Hausdorff measure
statement does not reduce to Gallagher's Lebesgue measure statement as one

satellite DPAC (Data Processing and Analysis Consortium) activities to prepare
automated software tools that will be used to derive basic astrophysical
information that is to be included in Gaia final archive. Methods. Our
algorithm has been tested by means of simulated Gaia spectrophotometry, which
is based on SDSS observations and theoretical spectral libraries covering a
wide sample of astronomical objects. Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) networks are
used to organize the information in clusters of objects, as homogeneous as
possible, according to their spectral energy distributions (SED), and to
project them onto a 2-D grid where the data structure can be visualized.
Results. We demonstrate the usefulness of the method by analyzing the spectra
that were rejected by the SDSS spectroscopic classification pipeline and thus
classified as ""UNKNOWN"". Firstly, our method can help to distinguish between
astrophysical objects and instrumental artifacts. Additionally, the application
of our algorithm to SDSS objects of unknown nature has allowed us to identify
classes of objects of similar astrophysical nature. In addition, the method
allows for the potential discovery of hundreds of novel objects, such as white
dwarfs and quasars. Therefore, the proposed method is shown to be very
promising for data exploration and knowledge discovery in very large

the master equation for the dumping of collective excitations of the system of

the extended Stone dual space of a certain associated Boolean algebra with
additional operations. A particular case of this result is that the profinite
completion of any abstract algebra is the extended Stone dual space of the
Boolean algebra of recognizable subsets of the abstract algebra endowed with
certain residuation operations. These results identify a connection between
topological algebra as applied in algebra and Stone duality as applied in
logic, and show that the notion of recognition originating in computer science
is intrinsic to profinite completion in mathematics in general. This connection
underlies a number of recent results in automata theory including a
generalization of Eilenberg-Reiterman theory for regular languages and a new
notion of compact recognition applying beyond the setting of regular languages.
The purpose of this paper is to give the underlying duality theoretic result in
its general form. Further we illustrate the power of the result by providing a
few applications in topological algebra and language theory. In particular, we
give a simple proof of the fact that any topological algebra quotient of a
profinite algebra which is again based on a Boolean space is in fact a
profinite algebra and we derive the conditions dual to the ones of the original
Eilenberg theorem in a fully modular manner. We cast our results in the setting
of extended Priestley duality for distributive lattices with additional
operations as some classes of languages of interest in automata fail to be

South, the nearest cluster-forming, infrared dark cloud. The physical
quantities are derived by fitting the hyperfine structure of N$_2$H$^+$. The
Herschel and 1.1-mm continuum maps show that a pc-scale filament fragments into
three clumps with radii of $0.1-0.2$ pc and masses of $40-230M_\odot$. We find
that the clumps contain smaller-scale ($\sim 0.04$ pc) structures, i.e., dense
cores. We identify 70 cores by applying CLUMPFIND to the N$_2$H$^+$ data cube.
In the central cluster-forming clump, the excitation temperature and line-width
tend to be large, presumably due to protostellar outflow feedback and stellar
radiation. However, for all the clumps, the virial ratios are evaluated to be
$0.1-0.3$, indicating that the internal motions play only a minor role in the
clump support. The clumps exhibit no free-fall, but low-velocity infall, and
thus the clumps should be supported by additional forces. The most promising
force is the globally-ordered magnetic field observed toward this region. We
propose that the Serpens South filament was close to magnetically-critical and
ambipolar diffusion triggered the cluster formation. We find that the northern
clump, which shows no active star formation, has a mass and radius comparable
to the central cluster-forming clump, and therefore, it is a likely candidate
of a {\it pre-protocluster clump}. The initial condition for cluster formation
is likely to be a magnetically-supported clump of cold, quiescent gas. This
appears to contradict the accretion-driven turbulence scenario, for which the
turbulence in the clumps is maintained by the accretion flow.

with the density of compact passive galaxies observed at high-z. Our results
place an upper limit of a factor ~2 to the evolution of the number density and
are inconsistent with a significant size evolution for most of the compact
galaxies observed at high-z. The evolution may be instead significant (up to a
factor 5) for the most extreme, ultracompact galaxies. Considering all compact
galaxies, regardless of LW age and star formation activity, a minority of local

secular decrease of the galaxy stellar mass due to simple stellar evolution may
in some cases be a non-negligible factor in the context of the evolution of the

online content offers researchers novel ways of engaging with data. The crucial
question for ensuring a balance between the supply and demand-side of data, is
whether this trend connects to existing scholarly practices and to the average
search skills of researchers. To gain insight into this process we conducted a
survey among nearly three hundred (N= 288) humanities scholars in the
Netherlands and Belgium with the aim of finding answers to the following
questions: 1) To what extent are digital databases and archives used? 2) What
are the preferences in search functionalities 3) Are there differences in
search strategies between novices and experts of information retrieval? Our
results show that while scholars actively engage in research online they mainly
search for text and images. General search systems such as Google and JSTOR are
predominant, while large-scale collections such as Europeana are rarely
consulted. Searching with keywords is the dominant search strategy and advanced
search options are rarely used. When comparing novice and more experienced
searchers, the first tend to have a more narrow selection of search engines,
and mostly use keywords. Our overall findings indicate that Google is the key
player among available search engines. This dominant use illustrates the
paradoxical attitude of scholars toward Google: while provenance and context
are deemed key academic requirements, the workings of the Google algorithm
remain unclear. We conclude that Google introduces a black box into digital
scholarly practices, indicating scholars will become increasingly dependent on
such black boxed algorithms. This calls for a reconsideration of the academic
principles of provenance and context.

galaxy, by analyzing the results of a fully self-consistent, high resolution
N-body+SPH simulation. We find different behaviours for gas and star particles.
Gas within corotation is driven in the central regions by the bar, where it
forms a pseudo-bulge (disky-bulge), but it undergoes negligible radial
displacement outside the bar region. Stars undergo substantial radial migration
at all times, caused first by transient spiral arms and later by the bar.
Despite the important amount of radial migration occurring in our model, its
impact on the chemical properties is limited. The reason is the relatively flat
abundance profile, due to the rapid early evolution of the whole disk. We show
that the implications of radial migration on chemical evolution can be studied
to a good accuracy by post-processing the results of the N-body+SPH calculation
with a simple chemical evolution model having detailed chemistry and a
parametrized description of radial migration. We find that radial migration
impacts on chemical evolution both directly (by moving around the long-lived
agents of nucleosynthesis, like e.g. SNIa or AGB stars, and thus altering the
abundance profiles of the gas) and indirectly (by moving around the long-lived
tracers of chemical evolution and thus affecting stellar metallicity profiles,
local age-metallicity relations and metallicity distributions of stars, etc.).

exactly solvable Kitaev spin models with two-body interactions. This connection
arises from the description of the low-energy theory of both systems in terms
of a tight-binding model of Majorana modes. In Kitaev spin models the Majorana
description provides a convenient representation to solve the model, whereas in
an array of topological nanowires it arises, because the physical Majorana
modes localized at wire ends permit tunnelling between wire ends and across
different Josephson junctions. We explicitly show that an array of junctions of
three wires -- a setup relevant to topological quantum computing with nanowires
-- can realize the Yao-Kivelson model, a variant of Kitaev spin models on a
decorated honeycomb lattice. Translating the results from the latter, we show
that the network can be constructed to give rise to collective states
characterized by Chern numbers \nu = 0, +/-1 and +/-2, and that defects in an
array can be associated with vortex-like quasi-particle excitations. Finally,
we analyze the stability of the collective states as well as that of the
network as a quantum information processor. We show that decoherence inducing
instabilities, be them due to disorder or phase fluctuations, can be understood

values of parameters recurrent relations on Barnes' functions give the proof of
level-rank duality of complete partition function, thus extending that duality
on non-integer level and rank. We note that integral representation of
universal partition function is defined on few disjoint regions in parameters'
space, corresponding to different signs of real parts of parameters, and
introduce a framework for discussion of analytic continuation of partition
functions(s) from these regions. Although initial integral representation is
symmetric under all permutations of parameters (which corresponds particularly
to $N \rightarrow -N$ duality of gauge theories with classical groups),
analytic continuations are not symmetric under transposition of parameters with
different signs of their real parts. For the particular case of SU(N)

to distinguish general multipole Weyl solutions from the constant-density

gauge boson Z' with purely LH complex couplings Delta_L^{qb}(Z') (q=d,s) and
couplings to muons Delta_A^{mu mu}(Z') and Delta_V^{mu mu}(Z') or the SM Z
boson with LH complex couplings Delta_L^{qb}(Z). We demonstrate how these

The correlations between various observables can test these NP scenarios. We
present the results as functions of Delta M_q/Delta M_q^SM, S_{psi phi} and
S_{psi K_S} which should be precisely determined in this decade. We calculate
the violation of the CMFV relation between BR(B_{s,d}-> mu^+ mu^-) and Delta
M_{s,d} in these scenarios. We find that the data on B_{s,d}->mu^+ mu^- from
CMS and LHCb can be reproduced in both scenarios but in the case of Z, Delta
M_s and S_{psi phi} have to be very close to their SM values. As far as
B_d->K^*mu^+mu^- anomalies are concerned the Z' scenario can significantly
soften these anomalies while the Z boson fails because of the small vector
coupling to muons. We also point out that recent proposals of explaining these
anomalies with the help of a real Wilson coefficient C^NP_9 implies uniquely an
enhancement of Delta M_s with respect to its SM value, while a complex C^NP_9
allows for both enhancement and suppression of Delta M_s and simultaneously
novel CP-violating effects. We also discuss briefly scenarios in which the Z'
boson has RH FCNC couplings. In this context we point out a number of
correlations between angular observables measured in B_d->K^*mu^+ mu^- that
arise in the absence of new CP-violating phases in scenarios with only LH or RH

bulk of the topological phase is either a band insulator or an Anderson
insulator. Both of them can protect edge states from backscattering. The
topological phases are explicitly distinguished as topological band insulator
or topological Anderson insulator from the ratio of the algebraic mean density
of states to the geometric mean density of states. The calculation reveals that
topological Anderson insulator can be induced by disorders from either a
topologically trivial band insulator or a topologically nontrivial band
insulator.

After a short general discussion of the Riesz representation we concretize,
firstly, on a d-dimensional and, secondly, a space-time one-dimensional
geometric Brownian motion. After this, two classical optimal stopping problems
are discussed: 1) the optimal investment problem and 2) the valuation of the
American put option. It is seen in both of these problems that the boundary of
the stopping region can be characterized as a unique solution of an integral

given by the coherence length of the photon pair. Both the preparation of the
input state and the implementation of the quantum gates are performed in a pair
of chained displaced Sagnac interferometers, which contribute to the overall
robustness of the setup. An average fidelity above 0.9 is obtained for the
remote state preparation process. This scheme allows for a prepared state to be

two-receiver (Rx) $X$-Network) with $M$ antennas at each node, as demonstrated

which we call the Li-Jafarkhani-Jafar (LJJ) scheme, was proposed for the $2

sum degrees of freedom (DoF) of $\frac{8}{3}$ and also a diversity gain of two
when fixed finite constellations are employed at each Tx. In the LJJ scheme,
each Tx required the knowledge of only its own channel unlike the Jafar-Shamai
scheme which required global CSIT to achieve the maximum possible sum DoF of
$\frac{8}{3}$. Bit error rate (BER) is an important performance metric when the
coding length is finite. This work first proposes a new STBC for a three
transmit antenna single user MIMO system. Building on this STBC, we extend the
LJJ scheme to the $2 \times 2$ $X$-Network with three antennas at each node.
Local channel knowledge is assumed at each Tx. It is shown that the proposed

lensing reconstruction from cosmic magnification. In paper I \citep{Yang2011},
we proposed a minimal variance estimator to overcome this problem. By utilizing
the different dependences of cosmic magnification and galaxy intrinsic
clustering on galaxy flux, we demonstrated that the otherwise overwhelming
galaxy intrinsic clustering can be significantly suppressed such that lensing
maps can be reconstructed with promising accuracy. This procedure relies
heavily on the accuracy of determining the galaxy bias from the same data.
Paper I adopts an iterative approach, which degrades toward high redshift. The
current paper presents an alternative method, improving over paper I. We prove
that the measured galaxy clustering between flux bins allows for simultaneous
determination of the lensing power spectrum and the flux dependence of galaxy
bias, at this redshift bin. Comparing to paper I, the new approach is not only
more straightforward, but also more robust. It identifies an ambiguity in
determining the galaxy bias and further discovers a mathematically robust way
to suppress this ambiguity to non-negligible level ($\sim 0.1%$). The
accurately determined galaxy bias can then be applied to the minimal variance
estimator proposed in paper I to improve the lensing map-making. The gain at
high redshift is significant. These maps can be used to measure other
statistics, such as cluster finding and peak statistics. Furthermore, by
including galaxy clustering measurement between different redshift bins, we can
also determine the lensing cross power spectrum between these bins, up to a
small and correctable multiplicative factor.

applications with locality of reference. It has been shown that when storage

the performance of TRANS list accessing algorithm using two special types of

crystal {\beta}-FeSe under hydrostatic pressure have been studied by using the
first-principles electronic structure calculations with van der Waals (vdW)
corrections. With applied pressures, the energy bands around the Fermi energy
level consisting mainly of Fe-3d orbitals show obvious energy shifts and
occupation variations, and meanwhile the frequencies of all optical phonon
modes increase. Among these phonon modes, the A1g mode, which relates to the Se
height from the Fe-Fe plane, shows a clear frequency jump in the range between
5 and 6 GPa. This is also the pressure range within which the highest
superconducting transition temperature Tc of FeSe is reached in experiments. In
comparison with the other phonon modes, the zero-point vibration of the A1g
mode induces the strongest fluctuation of local magnetic moment on Fe under a
pressure from 0 to 9 GPa, and the induced fluctuation reaches the maximum
around 5 GPa. These results suggest that the effect of phonon via spin-phonon
coupling need to be considered when exploring the superconducting mechanism in
iron-based superconductors.

separate domains of constant magnetization vectors $m^\pm \in \mathbb{S}^2$
that differ by an angle $2\alpha$. Assuming translation invariance tangential
to the wall, our main result is the rigorous derivation of a reduced model for
the energy of the optimal transition layer, which in a certain parameter regime
confirms the experimental, numerical and physical predictions: The minimal
energy splits into a contribution from an asymmetric, divergence-free core
which performs a partial rotation in $\mathbb{S}^2$ by an angle $2\theta$, and
a contribution from two symmetric, logarithmically decaying tails, each of
which completes the rotation from angle $\theta$ to $\alpha$ in $\mathbb{S}^1$.
The angle $\theta$ is chosen such that the total energy is minimal. The
contribution from the symmetric tails is known explicitly, while the
contribution from the asymmetric core is analyzed in [7]. Our reduced model is
the starting point for the analysis of a bifurcation phenomenon from symmetric
to asymmetric domain walls. Moreover, it allows for capturing asymmetric domain
walls including their extended tails (which were previously inaccessible to
brute-force numerical simulation).

This leads to a quasi-geostrophic balance in which, in a two-dimensional-like
fashion, the energy injected by solar radiation, winds or tides goes to large
scales in what is known as an inverse cascade. Yet, except for Ekman friction,
energy dissipation and turbulent mixing occur at small scale implying the
formation of such scales associated with breaking of geostrophic dynamics

be both at the same time? We exemplify here this dual behavior of energy with

finite sets as members) are basic mathematical and computational objects, and
also stand at the basis of some programming languages. This raises the need for
efficient representation of such sets, for example by numbers. In 2008, Kirby
proposed an adjunctive hierarchy of hereditarily finite sets, based on the fact
that they can also be seen as built up from the empty set by repeated
adjunction, that is, by the addition of a new single element drawn from the
already existing sets to an already existing set. Determining the cardinality
$a_n$ of each level of this hierarchy, problem crucial in establishing whether
the natural adjunctive hierarchy leads to an efficient encoding by numbers, was
left open.
  In this paper we solve this problem. Our results can be generalized to
hereditarily finite sets with atoms, or can be further refined by imposing
restrictions on rank, on cardinality, or on the maximum level from where the
new adjoined element can be drawn. We also show that $a_n$ satisfies the
asymptotic formula $a_n = C^{2^n} + O(C^{2^{n-1}})$, for a constant $C \approx
1.3399$, which is a too fast asymptotic growth for practical purposes. We thus
propose a very natural variant of the adjunctive hierarchy, whose asymptotic
behavior we prove to be $\Theta(2^n)$. To our knowledge, this is the first
result of this kind.

finitely generated projective modules over a tower of algebras can be endowed
with (co)algebra structures that, in many cases of interest, give rise to a
dual pair of Hopf algebras. Moreover, given a dual pair of Hopf algebras, one
can construct an algebra called the Heisenberg double, which is a
generalization of the classical Heisenberg algebra. The aim of this paper is to
study Heisenberg doubles arising from towers of algebras in this manner. First,
we develop the basic representation theory of such Heisenberg doubles and show
that if induction and restriction satisfy Mackey-like isomorphisms then the
Fock space representation of the Heisenberg double has a natural
categorification. This unifies the existing categorifications of the polynomial
representation of the Weyl algebra and the Fock space representation of the
Heisenberg algebra. Second, we develop in detail the theory applied to the
tower of 0-Hecke algebras, obtaining new Heisenberg-like algebras that we call
quasi-Heisenberg algebras. As an application of a generalized Stone--von
Neumann Theorem, we give a new proof of the fact that the ring of
quasisymmetric functions is free over the ring of symmetric functions.

Detection of a single photon scattered from the atoms creates the single spin
excitation, a Fock state embedded in the collective spin of the ensemble. The
state of the atomic ensemble is then detected by tomography via a quantum
non-demolition measurement of the collective spin. A macroscopic difference of
the order of $\sqrt{N_{\text{atom}}}$ in the marginal distribution of the

the collective spin pave the road towards generation of even more exotic states

X-ray pulsars and show significant changes in the line energy with the pulsar
luminosity. In a case of bright sources, the line centroid energy is
anti-correlated with the luminosity. Such a behaviour is often associated with
the onset and growth of the accretion column, which is believed to be the
origin of the observed emission and the cyclotron lines. However, this scenario
inevitably implies large gradient of the magnetic field strength within the
line-forming region, and it makes the formation of the observed line-like
features problematic. Moreover, the observed variation of the cyclotron line
energy is much smaller than could be anticipated for the corresponding
luminosity changes. We argue that a more physically realistic situation is that
the cyclotron line forms when the radiation emitted by the accretion column is
reflected from the neutron star surface. The idea is based on the facts that a
substantial part of column luminosity is intercepted by the neutron star
surface and the reflected radiation should contain absorption features. The
reflection model is developed and applied to explain the observed variations of
the cyclotron line energy in a bright X-ray pulsar V 0332+53 over a wide range
of luminosities.

discovery of functional elements in the human genome via sequence comparison.
While that is so, an important class of elements, those specific to humans, is
entirely missed by searching for sequence conservation across species. Here we
present an analysis based on variation data among human genomes that utilizes a
supervised machine learning approach for the identification of human specific
purifying selection in the genome. Using only allele frequency information from
the complete low coverage 1000 Genomes Project dataset in conjunction with a
support vector machine trained from known functional and non-functional
portions of the genome, we are able to accurately identify portions of the
genome constrained by purifying selection. Our method identifies previously
known human-specific gains or losses of function and uncovers many novel
candidates. Candidate targets for gain and loss of function along the human
lineage include numerous putative regulatory regions of genes essential for
normal development of the central nervous system, including a significant
enrichment of gain of function events near neurotransmitter receptor genes.
These results are consistent with regulatory turnover being a key mechanism in
the evolution of human-specific characteristics of brain development. Finally,
we show that the majority of the genome is unconstrained by natural selection
currently, in agreement with what has been estimated from phylogenetic methods
but in sharp contrast to estimates based on transcriptomics or other
high-throughput functional methods.

solved the problem in $O(mn + m^{31/16} \log^2 n)$ and $O(mn\log_{m/n\log n}n)$
time, respectively. Our main result is reducing the number of nonsaturating
pushes to $O(mn)$ across all scaling phases. Our algorithm can be seen as
complementary to King, et. al., in the sense that we solve the max-flow problem
in $O(mn)$ time when $m = O(n^{2-\epsilon})$ (all sparse and non-dense
networks), whereas King, et. al. solve it in $O(mn)$ time when $m =
\Omega(n^{1+\epsilon})$ (all dense and non-sparse networks).
  Our improvement is reached by a novel combination of Ahuja and Orlin's excess
scaling method and Orlin's compact flow networks. To our knowledge, this is the
first $O(mn)$ time max-flow algorithm that runs on this range of networks.
Further, we extend the range of Orlin's $O(mn)$ time algorithm from
$O(n^{16/15-\epsilon})$ to $O(n^{2-\epsilon})$, which is an improvement of
approximately $O(n^{0.94})$. Our result also establishes that the problem can

perfect) equilibrium. This auction format has recently attracted much
attention, with previous work establishing positive results for unit-demand
valuations and negative results for submodular valuations. This leaves a large
gap in our understanding between these valuation classes. In this work we
resolve this gap on the negative side. In particular, we show that even in the
very restricted case in which each bidder has either an additive valuation or a
unit-demand valuation, there exist instances in which the inefficiency at
equilibrium grows linearly with the minimum of the number of items and the
number of bidders. Moreover, these inefficient equilibria persist even under
iterated elimination of weakly dominated strategies. Our main result implies
linear inefficiency for many natural settings, including auctions with gross
substitute valuations, capacitated valuations, budget-additive valuations, and
additive valuations with hard budget constraints on the payments. Another
implication is that the inefficiency in sequential auctions is driven by the
maximum number of items contained in any player's optimal set, and this is
tight. For capacitated valuations, our results imply a lower bound that equals
the maximum capacity of any bidder, which is tight following the upper-bound
technique established by Paes Leme et al. \cite{PaesLeme2012}.

glitch recoveries. In some cases one first fits the time-of-arrivals (TOAs) to
obtain the ""time-averaged"" frequency $\nu$ and its first derivative $\dot\nu$,

$\dot\nu$ obtained this way are systematically biased, unless the time
intervals between the nearby data points of TOAs are smaller than about $10^4$
s, which is much shorter than typical observation intervals. Alternatively,
glitch parameters can be obtained by fitting the phases directly with
relatively smaller biases; but the initial recovery timescale is usually chosen
by eyes, which may introduce a strong bias. We also construct a
phenomenological model by assuming a pulsar's spin-down law of $\dot\nu\nu^{-3}
=-H_0 G(t)$ with $G(t)=1+\kappa e^{-t/\tau}$ for a glitch recovery, where $H_0$
is a constant and $\kappa$ and $\tau$ are the glitch parameters to be found.
This model can reproduce the observed data of slow glitches from B1822--09 and
a giant classical glitch of B2334+61, with $\kappa<0$ or $\kappa>0$,
respectively. We then use this model to simulate TOA data and test several
fitting procedures for a glitch recovery. The best procedure is: 1) use a very
high order polynomial (e.g. to 50th order) to precisely describe the phase; 2)
then obtain $\nu(t)$ and $\dot\nu(t)$ from the polynomial; and 3) the glitch
parameters are obtained from $\nu(t)$ or $\dot\nu(t)$. Finally, the uncertainty
in the starting time $t_0$ of a classical glitch causes uncertainties to some
glitch parameters, but less so to a slow glitch and $t_0$ of which can be

produced in the foreground of the Milky Way and varies significantly across the

interference can vary considerably across successive time slots. In this work,
we propose LeAP, a measurement data driven machine learning paradigm for power
control to manage up-link interference in LTE. The data driven approach has the
inherent advantage that the solution adapts based on network traffic,
propagation and network topology, that is increasingly heterogeneous with
multiple cell-overlays. LeAP system design consists of the following
components: (i) design of user equipment (UE) measurement statistics that are
succinct, yet expressive enough to capture the network dynamics, and (ii)
design of two learning based algorithms that use the reported measurements to
set the power control parameters and optimize the network performance. LeAP is
standards compliant and can be implemented in centralized SON (self organized
networking) server resource (cloud). We perform extensive evaluations using
radio network plans from real LTE network operational in a major metro area in

of a relationship between group theory and representation theory with the
theory of special functions. Specifically, it was discovered that many of the
special functions are (1) specific matrix elements of matrix representations of
Lie groups, and (2) basis functions of operator representations of Lie
algebras. By viewing the special functions in this way, it is possible to
derive many of their properties that were originally discovered using classical
analysis, such as generating functions, differential relations, and recursion
relations. This relationship is of interest to physicists due to the fact that
many of the common special functions, such as Hermite polynomials and Bessel
functions, are related to remarkably simple Lie groups used in physics.
Unfortunately, much of the literature on this subject remains inaccessible to
undergraduate students. The purpose of this project is to research the existing
literature and to organize the results, presenting the information in a way
that can be understood at the undergraduate level. The primary objects of study
will be the Heisenberg group and its relationship to the Hermite polynomials,
as well as the Euclidean group in the plane and its relationship to the Bessel
functions. The ultimate goal is to make the results relevant for undergraduate

the concept of shortest path, several quantitative measurements are proposed

domains tend to be more self-contained and thus it is more difficult for
knowledge from other domains to flow into them; at the same time, knowledge
from science domains, such as biomedicine-, chemistry-, and physics-related
domains can access and be accessed by other domains more easily. This paper
also finds that social science domains are more disunified than science

to another need at least one science domain to serve as an intermediate. This
paper contributes to discussions on disciplinarity and interdisciplinarity by

associated with shocks due to interaction with the Galactic interstellar

high velocity clouds like the Smith Cloud as they move from the Galactic halo

simulations of infalling gas.

chiral soliton approach (CSA) results for the spectrum of exotic and nonexotic
baryons. There are problems when one tries to project results of the CSA on the
simple quark models (QM): the parameter in $1/N_c$ expansion is so large for
the case of the baryon spectrum that extrapolation to the real $N_c=3$ world is
not possible; rigid (as well soft) rotator model and the bound state model
coincide in the first two orders in $1/N_c$, but differ in the next orders.
There is correspondence of the CSA and simple QM predictions for pentaquarks
(PQ) spectra in negative $S$ sector of the $\{27\}$ and $\{35\}$-plets: the
effective mass of strange quark is about $135 -130\,MeV$, slightly smaller for
$\{35\}$. For positive strangeness components the link between CSA and QM
requires strong dependence of the effective $\bar{s}$ mass on particular SU(3)
multiplet. The SU(3) configuration mixing is important, it pushes the spectrum
towards the simplistic model (with equal masses of the strange quark and
antiquark), and explanation of this nice property is lacking still. The success
of the CSA in describing many properties of baryons and light nuclei
(hypernuclei) means that predictions of pentaquark states should be considered
seriously. Existence of PQ by itself is without any doubt, although very narrow
PQ may not exist. Wide, even very wide PQ should exist, therefore, searches for
PQ remain to be an actual task.

stability region that extends to zero temperature. The free energy of such
states exhibits an essential singularity for weak compositional disorder
pointing to their necessary occurrence. Ferroelectric states appear as local
minima in the free energy at high temperatures and become stable below a
coexistence temperature $T_c$. We calculate the phase diagram in the electric
field-temperature plane and find a coexistence line of the polar and non-polar
phases which ends at a critical point. First-order phase transitions are
induced for fields sufficiently large to cross the region of stability of the
metastable paraelectric phase. These polar and non-polar states have distinct
structure factors from those of conventional ferroelectrics. We use this
theoretical framework to compare and to gain physical understanding of various
experimental results in typical relaxors.

the neutral atom region to the anionic instability threshold. As testing
systems we choose inert gases (He-like, Ne-like and Ar-like isoelectronic

results, it is apparent that, for inert gases case, the stability relation with
N is completely inverted in the singly-charged anion region (Z=N-1) with
respect to the neutral atom region (Z=N), i.e. larger systems are more stable
than the smaller ones. We devised a semi-analytical model (inspired by the

dependence on the nuclear charge near the threshold. This dependence is well
observed in our numerical computations. Finally, we were able to describe
qualitatively two universality classes for systems similar to inert gases and

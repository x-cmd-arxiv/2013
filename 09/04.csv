in global magnetospheric simulations with arbitrary clock angle is presented.
The technique is to begin at a magnetic null and iteratively march along the
separator by finding where four magnetic topologies meet on a spherical
surface. The technique is verified using exact solutions for separators
resulting from an analytic magnetic field model that superposes dipolar and
uniform magnetic fields. Global resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations are
performed using the three-dimensional BATS-R-US code with a uniform
resistivity, in eight distinct simulations with interplanetary magnetic field
(IMF) clock angles ranging from 0 (parallel) to 180 degrees (anti-parallel).
Magnetic nulls and separators are found in the simulations, and it is shown
that separators traced here are accurate for any clock angle, unlike the last
closed field line on the Sun-Earth line that fails for southward IMF. Trends in
magnetic null locations and the structure of magnetic separators as a function
of clock angle are presented and compared with those from the analytic field
model. There are many qualitative similarities between the two models, but
quantitative differences are also noted. Dependence on solar wind density is
briefly investigated.

proved to be extremely helpful to investigate several areas of stellar
astrophysics. Space-based missions opened a new window to the dynamics of
pulsation in several class of pulsating variable stars and facilitated detailed
studies of eclipsing binaries. The main aim of this mission is to better
understand the fascinating dynamics behind various stellar pulsational
phenomena (resonances, mode coupling, chaos, mode selection) and interior
physics (turbulent convection, opacities). This will also improve the
applicability of these astrophysical tools for distance measurements,
population and stellar evolution studies. We investigated the pragmatic details
of such a mission and found a number of advantages: minimal reprogramming of
the flight software, a favorable field of view, access to both galactic and LMC

sample of well classified targets, mainly through OGLE. Synergies and
significant overlap (spatial, temporal and in brightness) with both ground-
(OGLE, LSST) and space-based missions (GAIA, TESS) will greatly enhance the
scientific value of the Kepler-SEP mission. GAIA will allow full
characterization of the distance indicators. TESS will continuously monitor
this field for at least one year, and together with the proposed mission
provide long time series that cannot be obtained by other means. If Kepler-SEP

the scale of the ion gyroradius $\rho$, $\epsilon = \delta u/v_{\perp \rm i}$,
$v_{\perp \rm i}$ is the perpendicular ion thermal speed, and $c_1$ and $c_2$
are dimensionless constants. We test this theoretical result by numerically
simulating test particles interacting with strong reduced magnetohydrodynamic
(RMHD) turbulence. The heating rates in our simulations are well fit by this
formula. The best-fit values of $c_1$ are $\sim 1$. The best-fit values of
$c_2$ decrease (i.e., stochastic heating becomes more effective) as the grid
size and Reynolds number of the RMHD simulations increase. As an example, in a
$1024^2 \times 256$ RMHD simulation with a dissipation wavenumber of order the
inverse ion gyroradius, we find $c_2 = 0.21$. We show that stochastic heating
is significantly stronger in strong RMHD turbulence than in a field of randomly
phased Alfv\'en waves with the same power spectrum, because coherent structures
in strong RMHD turbulence increase orbit stochasticity in the regions where
ions are heated most strongly. We find that $c_1$ increases by a factor of
$\sim 3$ while $c_2$ changes very little as the ion thermal speed increases
from values $\ll v_{\rm A}$ to values $\sim v_{\rm A}$, where $v_{\rm A}$ is
the Alfv\'en speed. We discuss the importance of these results for
perpendicular ion heating in the solar wind.

performance of indoor optical wireless communication (OWC) systems are
introduced. Expurgated pulse-position modulation (EPPM) is proposed for this

(PAPR) needed for dimming of the indoor illumination. A correlation decoder
used at the receiver is shown to be optimal for indoor VLC systems, which are
shot noise and background-light limited. Interleaving applied on EPPM in order
to decrease the ISI effect in dispersive VLC channels can significantly
decrease the error probability. The proposed interleaving technique makes EPPM
a better modulation option compared to PPM for VLC systems or any other

increase the transmission rate when bandwidth-limited white LEDs are used as

general relation between quantum Griffiths singularities and the Harris
criterion for quantum phase transitions in disordered systems. If a clean
critical point violates the Harris criterion, it is destabilized by weak
disorder. At the same time, the Griffiths dynamical exponent $z'$ diverges upon
approaching the transition, suggesting unconventional critical behavior. In
contrast, if the Harris criterion is fulfilled, power-law Griffiths
singularities can coexist with clean critical behavior but $z'$ saturates at a
finite value. We present applications of our theory to a variety of systems
including quantum spin chains, classical reaction-diffusion systems and
metallic magnets; and we discuss modifications for transitions above the upper
critical dimension. Based on these results we propose a unified classification
of phase transitions in disordered systems.

theory of random dynamical systems (RDS) that provides a general coupling
prescription between the nodes of any given regulatory network given the
dynamics of each node is modeled by a RDS. The main virtues of this approach
are the following: (i) it provides a natural way to obtain arbitrarily large
networks by coupling together simple basic pieces, thus revealing the
modularity of regulatory networks; (ii) the assumptions about the stochastic
processes used in the modeling are fairly general, in the sense that the only
requirement is stationarity; (iii) there is a well developed mathematical
theory, which is a blend of smooth dynamical systems theory, ergodic theory and
stochastic analysis that allows one to extract relevant dynamical and
statistical information without solving the system; (iv) one may obtain the
classical rate equations form the corresponding stochastic version by averaging
the dynamic random variables (small noise limit). It is important to emphasize
that unlike the deterministic case, where coupling two equations is a trivial
matter, coupling two RDS is non-trivial, specially in our case, where the
coupling is performed between a state variable of one gene and the switching
stochastic process of another gene and, hence, it is not a priori true that the
resulting coupled system will satisfy the definition of a random dynamical
system. We shall provide the necessary arguments that ensure that our coupling
prescription does indeed furnish a coupled regulatory network of random
dynamical systems. Finally, the fact that classical rate equations are the
small noise limit of our stochastic model ensures that any validation or
prediction made on the basis of the classical theory is also a validation or
prediction of our model.

precisely, charge flow correlations in a generic conformal field theory (CFT).
These infrared finite observables are familiar from collider physics studies

expressed in terms of Wightman correlation functions in a certain limit. We
explain how to compute these quantities starting from their Euclidean analogues
by means of a non-trivial analytic continuation which, in the framework of CFT,
can elegantly be performed in Mellin space. The relation between the charge
flow correlations and Euclidean correlation functions can be reformulated
directly in configuration space, bypassing the Mellin representation, as a
certain Lorentzian double discontinuity of the correlation function integrated
along the cuts. We illustrate the general formalism in N=4 SYM, making use of
the well-known results on the four-point correlation function of half-BPS
scalar operators. We compute the double scalar flow correlation in N=4 SYM, at
weak and strong coupling and show that it agrees with known results obtained by
different techniques. One of the remarkable features of the N=4 theory is that
the scalar and energy flow correlations are proportional to each other.
Imposing natural physical conditions on the energy flow correlations
(finiteness, positivity and regularity), we formulate additional constraints on
the four-point correlation functions in N=4 SYM that should be valid at any
coupling and away from the planar limit.

measurements combined with pre-and-post-selection to cosmology. Here,
pre-selection means specifying the wave function of the universe or, in a
popular semi-classical approximation, the initial quantum state of a subset of
quantum fields propagating in a classical back-ground spacetime. The novel
feature is post-selection: the additional specification of a condition on the
quantum state in the far future. I discuss ""natural"" final conditions, and show
how they may lead to potentially large and observable effects at the present

(VLC) system that utilizes white light emitting diodes (LED) as sources
requires new networking techniques adapted to the lighting features. In this
paper we introduce two multiple access techniques using expurgated PPM (EPPM)
that can be implemented using LEDs and support lighting features such as
dimming. Multilevel symbols are used to provide M-ary signaling for multiple
users using multilevel EPPM (MEPPM). Using these multiple-access schemes we are
able to control the optical peak to average power ratio (PAPR) in the system,
and hereby control the dimming level. In the first technique, the M-ary data of
each user is first encoded using an optical orthogonal code (OOC) assigned to
the user, and the result is fed into a EPPM encoder to generate a multilevel
signal. The second multiple access method uses sub-sets of the EPPM
constellation to apply MEPPM to the data of each user. While the first approach
has a larger Hamming distance between the symbols of each user, the latter can
provide higher bit-rates for users in VLC systems using bandwidth-limited LEDs.

identifies pulsars from recent surveys using image pattern recognition with
deep neural nets---the PICS (Pulsar Image-based Classification System) AI. The
AI mimics human experts and distinguishes pulsars from noise and interferences
by looking for patterns from candidate. The information from each pulsar
candidate is synthesized in four diagnostic plots, which consist of up to
thousands pixel of image data. The AI takes these data from each candidate as
its input and uses thousands of such candidates to train its ~9000 neurons.
Different from other pulsar selection programs which use pre-designed patterns,
the PICS AI teaches itself the salient features of different pulsars from a set
of human-labeled candidates through machine learning. The deep neural networks
in this AI system grant it superior ability in recognizing various types of
pulsars as well as their harmonic signals. The trained AI's performance has
been validated with a large set of candidates different from the training set.
In this completely independent test, PICS ranked 264 out of 277 pulsar-related
candidates, including all 56 previously known pulsars, to the top 961 (1%) of
90008 test candidates, missing only 13 harmonics. The first non-pulsar
candidate appears at rank 187, following 45 pulsars and 141 harmonics. In other
words, 100% of the pulsars were ranked in the top 1% of all candidates, while
80% were ranked higher than any noise or interference. The performance of this
system can be improved over time as more training data are accumulated. This AI
system has been integrated into the PALFA survey pipeline and has discovered
six new pulsars to date.

use of two different approximations to the EXX kernel: the PGG approximation

whereas the PGG approximation neglects the discontinuity the CEDA includes it
explicitly. By studying model molecular systems it is shown that the so-called
field counter-acting effect in the density functional description of molecular
chains can be viewed in terms of the discontinuity of the static kernel. The
role of the frequency dependence is also investigated, highlighting its
importance for long-range charge transfer excitations as well as inner-shell

function appears to be given by a product of partition functions of the
standard 2nd-derivative ""partially massless"" spin s fields, generalising the
previously known expression for the 1-loop Weyl graviton (s=2) partition
function. We compute the corresponding spin s Weyl anomaly coefficients a_s and
c_s. Our result for a_s reproduces the expression found recently in
arXiv:1306.5242 by an indirect method implied by AdS/CFT (which relates the
partition function of a CHS field on S^4 to a ratio of known partition
functions of massless higher spin field in AdS_5 with alternate boundary
conditions). We also obtain similar results for the fermionic CHS fields. In
this half-integer spin s case the CHS partition function on (A)dS background is
given by a product of squares of ""partially massless"" spin s partition
functions and one extra factor corresponding to a special massive conformally
invariant spin s field. It was noticed in arXiv:1306.5242 that the sum of the
bosonic a_s coefficients over all spins s is zero when computed using the

applications, such as regression, classification, density estimation,

obtain a set of network parameters that has empirically been shown to be close
to a good solution, followed by further optimisation using a regularised
variant of Newton's method, where the level of regularisation is determined and
adjusted automatically; the latter uses second-order derivative information to
improve convergence, but without the need to evaluate or store the full Hessian
matrix, by using a fast approximate method to calculate Hessian-vector
products. This combination of methods allows for the training of complicated
networks that are difficult to optimise using standard backpropagation
techniques. SkyNet employs convergence criteria that naturally prevent
overfitting, and also includes a fast algorithm for estimating the accuracy of
network outputs. The utility and flexibility of SkyNet are demonstrated by
application to a number of toy problems, and to astronomical problems focusing
on the recovery of structure from blurred and noisy images, the identification
of gamma-ray bursters, and the compression and denoising of galaxy images. The

This simple mapping raises a crucial question: does the embedding preserve the
entanglement structure? It is known that the answer is affirmative for $n=2$
and $n=3$. That is, under either local unitary (LU) operations or with respect
to stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC), there is a
one-to-one correspondence between the 2- (or 3)-qubit orbits and the 2- (or
3)-fermion orbits with 4 (or 6) modes. However these results do not generalize
as the mapping from the $n$-qubit orbits to the $n$-fermion orbits with $2n$
modes is no longer surjective for $n>3$. Here we consider the case of $n=4$. We
show that surprisingly, the orbit mapping from qubits to fermions remains
injective under SLOCC, and a similar result holds under LU for generic orbits.
As a byproduct, we obtain a complete answer to the problem of SLOCC equivalence

ability to predict novel protein-protein interactions (PPIs), to unravel
interactions in protein complexes, and thus gain more information about the
function and behavior of genes. One of the challenges of identifying reliable
DDIs is domain promiscuity. Promiscuous domains are domains that can occur in
many domain architectures and are therefore found in many proteins. This
becomes a problem for a method where the score of a domain-pair is the ratio
between observed and expected frequencies because the PPI network is sparse. As
such, many protein-pairs will be non-interacting and domain-pairs with
promiscuous domains will be penalized. This domain promiscuity challenge to the
problem of inferring reliable DDIs from PPIs has been recognized, and a number
of work-arounds have been proposed. In this paper, we report an application of
Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) to this problem. We find that the relationship
between formal concepts provide a natural way for rare domains to elevate the
rank of promiscuous domains, and enrich highly ranked domain-pairs with
reliable DDIs. This piggy-backing of promiscuous domains onto rare domains is
possible due to the domain architecture of proteins which mixes promiscuous
with rare domains.

independently fit a parameterized MW potential and a three-integral,

abundance-selected sub-populations (MAPs), accounting for the complex selection
effects affecting the data. We robustly measure the total surface density

MAPs with small radial scale lengths as dynamical tracers probes 4.5 < R_GC/kpc

measure the mass-weighted Galactic disk scale length to be R_d = 2.15+/-0.14
kpc, in agreement with the photometrically inferred spatial distribution of
stellar mass. We thereby measure dynamically the mass of the Galactic stellar
disk to unprecedented accuracy: M_* = 4.6+/-0.3+3.0x(R_0/kpc-8)x10^{10}Msun and
a total local surface density of \Sigma_{R_0}(Z=1.1 kpc) = 68+/-4 Msun/pc^2 of
which 38+/-4 Msun/pc^2 is contributed by stars and stellar remnants. By
combining our surface density measurements with the terminal velocity curve, we
find that the MW's disk is maximal in that V_{c,disk} / V_{c,total} =
0.83+/-0.04 at R=2.2 R_d. We also constrain for the first time the radial
profile of the dark halo at such small Galactocentric radii, finding that
\rho_{DM} (r;near R_0) \propto 1 / r^\alpha with \alpha < 1.53 at 95%

is critical for understanding AGN evolution, unification, and parsec-scale AGN
physics. For unobscured (Type-1) AGN, where we have a direct view of the
accretion disk, the dust covering factor can be measured by computing the ratio
of re-processed mid-IR emission to intrinsic nuclear bolometric luminosity. We
use this technique to estimate the obscured AGN fraction as a function of
luminosity and redshift for 513 Type-1 AGN from the XMM-COSMOS survey. The
re-processed and intrinsic luminosities are computed by fitting the 18-band
COSMOS photometry with a custom SED-fitting code, which jointly models emission
from: hot-dust in the AGN torus, the accretion disk, and the host-galaxy. We
find a relatively shallow decrease of the luminosity ratio as a function of
Lbol, which we interpret as a corresponding decrease in the obscured fraction.
In the context of the receding torus model, where dust sublimation reduces the
covering factor of more luminous AGN, our measurements require a torus height
which increases with luminosity as h ~ Lbol^{0.3-0.4}. Our obscured
fraction-luminosity relation agrees with determinations from SDSS censuses of
Type-1 and Type-2 quasars, and favors a torus optically thin to mid-IR
radiation. We find a much weaker dependence of obscured fraction on 2-10 keV

consistent with the ""Strigari mass scale"" observed in low-luminosity dwarf
galaxies. Flat-cored subhalos also resolve the mass-discrepancy between
simulated and observed satellites around the Milky Way. For the UCHVCs we
calculate the photoionization-limited hydrostatic gas profiles for any
distance-dependent total observed HI mass and predict the associated
(projected) HI half-mass radii, assuming the clouds are embedded in distant (d
> 300 kpc) and unstripped subhalos. For a typical UCHVC (0.9 Jy km/s) we
predict physical HI half-mass radii of 0.18 to 0.35 kpc (or angular sizes of
0.6 to 2.1 arcmin) for distances ranging from 300 kpc to 2 Mpc. As a
consistency check we model the gas rich dwarf galaxy Leo T, for which there is
a well-resolved HI column density profile and a known distance (420 kpc). For
Leo T we find that a subhalo with M_{300} ~ 8 (+/-0.2) 10^6 M_{sun} best fits
the observed HI profile. We derive an upper limit of P_{HIM} < 150 K/cm^3 for
the pressure of any enveloping hot IGM gas at the distance of Leo T. Our
analysis suggests that some of the UCHVCs may in fact constitute a population
of 21-cm-selected but optically-faint dwarf galaxies in the Local Group.

for the detailed and reliable description of nuclei and hadrons. Here we extend
and further develop these investigations by applying the model to the

show that their age-metallicity relation (AMR) can be divided into two
distinct, parallel sequences at [Fe/H] $\ga -1.8$. Approximately one-third of
the clusters form an offset sequence that spans the full range in age ($\sim
10.5$--13 Gyr), but is more metal rich at a given age by $\sim 0.6$ dex in
[Fe/H]. All but one of the clusters in the offset sequence show orbital
properties that are consistent with membership in the MW disk. They are not
simply the most metal-rich GCs, which have long been known to have disk-like
kinematics, but they are the most metal-rich clusters at all ages. The slope of
the mass-metallicity relation (MMR) for galaxies implies that the offset in
metallicity of the two branches of the AMR corresponds to a mass decrement of 2
dex, suggesting host galaxy masses of $M_{*} \sim 10^{7-8} \msol$ for GCs that
belong to the more metal-poor AMR. We suggest that the metal-rich branch of the
AMR consists of clusters that formed in-situ in the disk, while the metal-poor
GCs were formed in relatively low-mass (dwarf) galaxies and later accreted by
the MW. The observed AMR of MW disk stars, and of the LMC, SMC and WLM dwarf
galaxies are shown to be consistent with this interpretation, and the relative
distribution of implied progenitor masses for the halo GC clusters is in
excellent agreement with the MW subhalo mass function predicted by simulations.
A notable implication of the bifurcated AMR, is that the identical mean ages
and spread in ages, for the metal rich and metal poor GCs are difficult to
reconcile with an in-situ formation for the latter population.

formation theory. Here we revisit the issue of determining the substellar
initial mass function (IMF), based on a comparison between NGC1333 and IC348,
two clusters in the Perseus star-forming region. We derive their mass
distributions for a range of model isochrones, varying distances, extinction
laws and ages, with comprehensive assessments of the uncertainties. We find
that the choice of isochrone and other parameters have significant effects on
the results, thus we caution against comparing IMFs obtained using different
approaches. For NGC1333, we find that the star/BD ratio R is between 1.9 and
2.4, for all plausible scenarios, consistent with our previous work. For IC348,
R is between 2.9 and 4.0, suggesting that previous studies have overestimated
this value. Thus, the star forming process generates about 2.5-5 substellar
objects per 10 stars. The derived star/BD ratios correspond to a slope of the
power-law mass function of alpha=0.7-1.0 for the 0.03-1.0Msol mass range. The
median mass in these clusters - the typical stellar mass - is between
0.13-0.30Msol. Assuming that NGC1333 is at a shorter distance than IC348, we
find a significant difference in the cumulative distribution of masses between
the two clusters, resulting from an overabundance of very low mass objects in
NGC1333. Gaia astrometry will constrain the cluster distances better and will
lead to a more definitive conclusion. Furthermore, ratio R is somewhat larger
in IC348 compared with NGC1333, although this difference is still within the
margins of error. Our results indicate that environments with higher object
density may produce a larger fraction of very low mass objects, in line with
predictions for brown dwarf formation through gravitational fragmentation of
filaments falling into a cluster potential.

optical spectroscopy of strong lens candidates discovered in the two widest
extragalactic surveys conducted by the Herschel Space Observatory: the

Multi-tiered Extragalactic Survey (HerMES). From a sample of 30 Herschel
sources with S_500>100 mJy, 21 are strongly lensed (multiply imaged), 4 are
moderately lensed (singly imaged), and the remainder require additional data to
determine their lensing status. We apply a visibility-plane lens modeling
technique to the SMA data to recover information about the masses of the lenses
as well as the intrinsic (i.e., unlensed) sizes (r_half) and far-infrared
luminosities (L_FIR) of the lensed submillimeter galaxies (SMGs). The sample of
lenses comprises primarily isolated massive galaxies, but includes some groups
and clusters as well. Several of the lenses are located at z_lens>0.7, a
redshift regime that is inaccessible to lens searches based on Sloan Digital
Sky Survey spectroscopy. The lensed SMGs are amplified by factors that are
significantly below statistical model predictions given the 500um flux
densities of our sample. We speculate that this may reflect a deficiency in our
understanding of the intrinsic sizes and luminosities of the brightest SMGs.
The lensed SMGs span nearly one decade in L_FIR (median L_FIR=7.9x10^12 L_sun)
and two decades in FIR luminosity surface density (median Sigma_FIR=6.0x10^11
L_sun kpc^-2). The strong lenses in this sample and others identified via
(sub-)mm surveys will provide a wealth of information regarding the
astrophysics of galaxy formation and evolution over a wide range in redshift.

also allows for a Universe that has a very different future than the one
currently predicted by a cosmological constant. These models also allow for
transient periods of significant scalar field energy (SSFE) over the history of

under these conditions leads to the disappearance of one of the alleles and
substantially reduces the diversity of the population. The allele that
disappears, and the other allele frequencies at equilibrium, depend only on
their initial values, and so does the time to equilibration. However, certain
combinations of allele frequencies remain constant during the process,
revealing the emergence of strong correlation between the two loci promoted by
the epistatic mechanism of incompatibility. We determine the geometrical

appears to be thicker for T Mon (tau(0.55micron) = 0.15). They are located at
about 15-20 stellar radii. Following our previous work, we derived a likely
period-excess relation in the VISIR PAH1 filter, f(8.6micron)[%]=
0.81(+/-0.04)P[day]. We argue that the impact of CSEs on the mid-IR
period-luminosity (P-L) relation cannot be negligible because they can bias the
Cepheid brightness by up to about 30 %. For the K-band P-L relation, the CSE
contribution seems to be lower (< 5 %), but the sample needs to be enlarged to
firmly conclude that the impact of the CSEs is negligible in this band.

surrounded by optically thick envelopes and/or discs and are observed to have
associated regions that produce polarized light at near-infrared wavelengths.
These polarized regions are thought to be lower-density outflows along the
polar axes of the YSO envelopes. Using the 0.2 arcsec spatial resolution of the
Near-Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer on the Hubble Space
Telescope we are examining the structure of the envelopes and outflow regions
of massive YSOs in star-forming regions within a few kpc of the Sun. Here we
report on 2 micron polarimetry of Mon R2-IRS3, S140-IRS1, and AFGL 2591.
  All three sources contain YSOs with highly-polarized monopolar outflows, with
Mon R2-IRS3 containing at least two YSOs in a small cluster. The central stars
of all four YSOs are also polarized, with position angles perpendicular to the
directions of the outflows. We infer that this polarization is due to
scattering and absorption by aligned grains. We have modelled our observations
of S140-IRS1 and AFGL 2591 as light scattered and absorbed both by spherical
grains and by elongated grains that are aligned by magnetic fields. Models that
best reproduce the observations have a substantial toroidal component to the
magnetic field in the equatorial plane. Moreover, the toroidal magnetic field
in the model that best fits AFGL 2591 extends a large fraction of the height of
the model cavity, which is 10^5 au. We conclude that the massive YSOs in this
study all show evidence of the presence of a substantial toroidal magnetic
field.

lower mass-loss rate. We compare our data with published semi-empirical models

Hybrid Automata (SHA) are powerful formalisms to model and to reason about the
dynamics of biological systems, due to their ability to capture the
stochasticity inherent in biological processes. A classical question in formal
modelling with clear relevance to biological modelling is the model checking
problem. i.e. calculate the probability that a behaviour, expressed for
instance in terms of a certain temporal logic formula, may occur in a given
stochastic process. However, one may not only be interested in the notion of
satisfiability, but also in the capacity of a system to mantain a particular
emergent behaviour unaffected by the perturbations, caused e.g. from extrinsic
noise, or by possible small changes in the model parameters. To address this
issue, researchers from the verification community have recently proposed
several notions of robustness for temporal logic providing suitable definitions
of distance between a trajectory of a (deterministic) dynamical system and the
boundaries of the set of trajectories satisfying the property of interest. The
contributions of this paper are twofold. First, we extend the notion of
robustness to stochastic systems, showing that this naturally leads to a
distribution of robustness scores. By discussing two examples, we show how to
approximate the distribution of the robustness score and its key indicators:
the average robustness and the conditional average robustness. Secondly, we
show how to combine these indicators with the satisfaction probability to
address the system design problem, where the goal is to optimize some control
parameters of a stochastic model in order to best maximize robustness of the
desired specifications.

evidence that VEGF receptors localize in caveloae and other regions of the
plasma membrane, and for other receptors, it has been shown that receptor
clustering has an impact on dimerization and thus also on signaling. Overall,
receptor clustering is part of a complex ecosystem of interactions and how
receptor clustering impacts dimerization is not well understood. To address
these questions, we have formulated the simplest possible model. We have
postulated the existence of a single high affinity region in the cell membrane,
which acts as a transient trap for receptors. We have defined an ODE model by
introducing high- and low-density receptor variables and introduce the
corresponding reactions from a realistic model of VEGF signal initiation.
Finally, we use the model to investigate the relation between the degree of

the PSPT of at least one of the nodes. We show that the structure of social

for 4U 1538-522 find the pulse period to have exhibited a spin-up trend until
approximately 2009, after which there is evidence for a torque reversal, with
the source beginning to spin down to the most recently-measured period of
525.407 +/- 0.001 s. The most recent INTEGRAL observations of 4U 1907+09 are
not found to yield statistically significant pulse periods due to the
significantly lower flux from the source compared to 4U 1538-522. A spectral
model consisting of a power-law continuum with an exponential cutoff and
modified by two cyclotron resonance scattering features is found to fit both
sources well, with the cyclotron scattering features detected at ~22 and ~49
keV for 4U 1538-522 and at ~18 and ~36 keV in 4U 1907+09. The spectral
parameters of 4U 1538-522 are generally not found to vary significantly with
flux, and there is little to no variation across the torque reversal. Examining
our results in conjunction with previous work, we find no evidence for a
correlation between cyclotron line energy and luminosity for 4U 1538-522. 4U
1907+09 shows evidence for a positive correlation between cyclotron line energy

beyond the tight-binding limit. We observe a gapped density of states
consistent with a modified Hofstadter spectrum at a flux per plaquette of

bulk-states and de-localized edge-states. Time-resolved measurements reveal
dynamical separation of localized edge-excitations into spin-polarized
currents. The RF circuit paradigm is naturally compatible with non-local
coupling schemes, allowing us to implement a M\""{o}bius strip topology

illuminates the origins of topology in band-structure, and when combined with

over the space of n marked points on a sphere and has as integrand two factors.
The first factor is a combination of Parke-Taylor-like terms dressed with U(N)
color structures while the second is a Pfaffian. The S-matrix of a U(N)xU(N')
cubic scalar theory is obtained by simply replacing the Pfaffian with a U(N')
version of the previous U(N) factor. Given that gravity amplitudes are obtained
by replacing the U(N) factor in Yang-Mills by a second Pfaffian, we are led to
a natural color-kinematics correspondence. An expansion of the integrand of the
scalar theory leads to sums over trivalent graphs and are directly related to
the KLT matrix. We find a connection to the BCJ color-kinematics duality as
well as a new proof of the BCJ doubling property that gives rise to gravity
amplitudes. We end by considering a special kinematic point where the partial
amplitude simply counts the number of color-ordered planar trivalent trees,
which equals a Catalan number. The scattering equations simplify dramatically
and are equivalent to a special Y-system with solutions related to roots of
Chebyshev polynomials.

its equational properties. We formulate axioms for guarded fixpoint operators
generalizing the axioms of iteration theories of Bloom and Esik. Models of
these axioms include both standard (e.g., cpo-based) models of iteration
theories and models of guarded recursion such as complete metric spaces or the
topos of trees studied by Birkedal et al. We show that the standard result on
the satisfaction of all Conway axioms by a unique dagger operation generalizes
to the guarded setting. We also introduce the notion of guarded trace operator
on a category, and we prove that guarded trace and guarded fixpoint operators
are in one-to-one correspondence. Our results are intended as first steps
leading to the description of classifying theories for guarded recursion and
hence completeness results involving our axioms of guarded fixpoint operators
in future work.

(OSS). Recent research has been pursued to explore the statistical laws of such
an operation, but few of those papers conduct empirical investigations on
commit interval (i.e., the waiting time between two consecutive commits). In
this paper, we investigated software developer's collective and individual
commit behavior in terms of the distribution of commit intervals, and found
that 1) the data sets of project-level commit interval within both the
lifecycle and each release of the projects analyzed roughly follow power-law
distributions; and 2) lifecycle- and release-level collective commit interval
on class files can also be best fitted with power laws. These findings reveal
some general (collective) collaborative development patterns of OSS projects,
e.g., most of the waiting times between two consecutive commits to a central
repository are short, but only a few of them experience a long duration of
waiting. Then, the implications of what we found for OSS research were
outlined, which could provide an insight into understanding OSS development
processes better based on software developers' historical commit behavior.

source-destination pairs communicating with each other via two relays. We
analyze the degrees of freedom (DoF) of this network when the relays are
restricted to perform linear schemes, and the channel gains are constant (i.e.,
slow fading). We show that, somewhat surprisingly, by using vector-linear
strategies at the relays, it is possible to achieve 4/3 sum-DoF when the
channel gains are real. The key achievability idea is to alternate relaying
coefficients across time, to create different end-to-end interference
structures (or topologies) at different times. Although each of these
topologies has only 1 sum-DoF, we manage to achieve 4/3 by coding across them.
Furthermore, we develop a novel outer bound that matches our achievability,
hence characterizing the sum-DoF of two-hop interference channels with linear
schemes. As for the case of complex channel gains, we characterize the sum-DoF
with linear schemes to be 5/3. We also generalize the results to the
multi-antenna setting, characterizing the sum-DoF with linear schemes to be
2M-1/3 (for complex channel gains), where M is the number of antennas at each
node.

universal maximum speed of signal-propagation. Different field excitations see
a different effective metric and hence a different light cone. In these
theories, although one can define the Killing horizon in a conventional way,
this definition does not capture the notion of a black hole. This is so because
there exist modes which see a wider light cone than the one defined by the
Killing Horizon and therefore can escape to infinity. However, there exist
solutions of these theories which admit a special spacelike hypersurface which
acts as a one-way membrane. Signals from beyond this hypersurface can never
escape to infinity and are destined to hit the singularity. In this sense this
hypersurface acts like a black-hole horizon and is called the Universal Horizon
because it traps modes travelling with arbitrarily high velocities. We use the
Noether charge method {\it \`a la} Wald to show that a first law, which
resembles the first law of thermodynamics, can be formulated for universal
horizons in the Einstein-{\AE}ther theory. This seems to suggest that in
Lorentz violating theories one should ascribe the thermodynamical properties to
the universal horizon and not to the Killing horizon.

harmonic sums of multiple weights, which are multiplied by explicit powers of

to trap unwanted higher-order modes (HOMs) corresponding to zero-group-velocity

generally from photonic band and perturbation theoretical arguments. Transverse
wakefields resulting from this effect are observed in a hybrid dielectric PhC
accelerating cavity based on a triangular lattice of sapphire rods. These
wakefields are, on average, an order of magnitude higher than those in the

of translational symmetry (and, thus, the bandgap concept) can dramatically
improve HOM damping in PhC-based structures.

We find that the morphologies at 118 MHz and 1.4 GHz match very closely apart

significant spatial variation of the spectra across the extent of each lobe.
Both the spectral-index distribution and the morphology at low radio

by a phylogenetic tree has been the subject of many studies, and numerous
methods have been proposed to this purpose. Theoretical results are available
that show that when the mutation rate become too large, reconstructing the
ancestral state at the tree root is no longer feasible. Here, we also study the
reconstruction of the ancestral changes that occurred along the tree edges. We
show that, depending on the tree and branch length distribution, reconstructing
these changes (i.e. reconstructing the ancestral state of all internal nodes in
the tree) may be easier or harder than reconstructing the ancestral root state.
However, results from information theory indicate that for the standard Yule
tree, the task of reconstructing internal node states remains feasible, even
for very high substitution rates. Moreover, computer simulations demonstrate
that for more complex trees and scenarios, this result still holds. For a large
variety of counting, parsimony-based and likelihood-based methods, the
predictive accuracy of a randomly selected internal node in the tree is indeed
much higher than the accuracy of the same method when applied to the tree root.
Moreover, parsimony- and likelihood-based methods appear to be remarkably
robust to sampling bias and model mis-specification.

q, and present a detailed comparison of the methods' performance. Both methods
yield the same radial binary fraction profile for the same cluster, which
therefore supports the robustness and applicability of either method to young
star clusters which are as yet unaffected by the presence of multiple stellar
populations. The binary fractions in these two clusters are characterized by
opposite trends in their radial profiles. NGC 1805 exhibits a decreasing trend
with increasing radius in the central region, followed by a slow increase to
the field's binary-fraction level, while NGC 1818 shows a monotonically
increasing trend. This may indicate dominance of a more complicated physical
mechanism in the cluster's central region than expected a priori. Time-scale
arguments imply that early dynamical mass segregation should be very efficient
and, hence, likely dominates the dynamical processes in the core of NGC 1805.
Meanwhile, in NGC 1818 the behavior in the core is probably dominated by
disruption of soft binary systems. We speculate that this may be owing to the
higher velocity dispersion in the NGC 1818 core, which creates an environment
in which the efficiency of binary disruption is high compared with that in the
NGC 1805 core.

amino acids there are multiple synonymous codons that can encode the amino
acid. The translation speed can vary from one codon to another, thus there is
room for changing the ribosome speed while keeping the amino acid sequence and
hence the resulting protein. Recently, it has been noticed that the choice of
the synonymous codon, via the resulting distribution of slow- and
fast-translated codons, affects not only on the average speed of one ribosome
translating the messenger RNA (mRNA) but also might have an effect on nearby
ribosomes by affecting the appearance of ""traffic jams"" where multiple
ribosomes collide and form queues. To test this ""context effect"" further, we
here investigate the effect of the sequence of synonymous codons on the
ribosome traffic by using a ribosome traffic model with codon-dependent rates,
estimated from experiments. We compare the ribosome traffic on wild type
sequences and sequences where the synonymous codons were swapped randomly. By
simulating translation of 87 genes, we demonstrate that the wild type
sequences, especially those with a high bias in codon usage, tend to have the
ability to reduce ribosome collisions, hence optimizing the cellular investment
in the translation apparatus. The magnitude of such reduction of the
translation time might have a significant impact on the cellular growth rate
and thereby have importance for the survival of the species.

(TNOs) and Jupiter-family comets. For this reason it is possible to access the
smaller ones, which is more difficult to do with the TNO population. The goal
of this work is to characterize a set of 16 Centaurs in terms of their size,
albedo, and thermal properties. We study the correlations, for a more extended
sample obtained from the literature, of diameter, albedo, orbital parameters,
and spectral slopes. We performed three-band photometric observations using
Herschel-PACS and used a consistent method for the data reduction and aperture
photometry of this sample to obtain monochromatic flux densities at 70, 100,
and 160 $\mu$m. Additionally, we used Spitzer-MIPS flux densities at 24 and 70
$\mu$m when available. We also included in our Centaur sample scattered disk
objects (SDOs), a dynamical family of TNOS, using results previously published
by our team, and some Centaurs observed only with the Spitzer/MIPS instrument.
We have determined new radiometric sizes and albedos of 16 Centaurs. The first
conclusion is that the albedos of Centaur objects are not correlated with their
orbital parameters. Similarly, there is no correlation between diameter and
orbital parameters. Most of the objects in our sample are dark (pv < 7%) and
most of them are small (D < 120km). However, there is no correlation between
albedo and diameter, in particular for the group of the small objects as albedo
values are homogeneously distributed between 4 to 16%. The correlation with the
color of the objects showed that red objects are all small (mean diameter 65
km), while the gray ones span a wide range of sizes (mean diameter 120 km).
Moreover, the gray objects tend to be darker, with a mean albedo of 5.6%,
compared with a mean of 8.5% (ranging from 5 to 15%) for the red objects.

driven both theoretical and computational aspects of modeling its growth with
an aim to design and control film's surface morphology. Oftentimes, smooth
surface is desirable and is experimentally achievable via molecular-beam
epitaxy (MBE) growth technique with exceptionally low deposition flux. Adatoms
on the film grown with such a method tend to have large diffusion length which
can be computationally very costly when certain statistical aspects are
demanded. We present a graph theoretic approach to modeling MBE grown thin film
with long atomic mean free path. Using Markovian assumption and given a local
diffusion bias, we derive the transition probabilities for a random walker to
traverse from one lattice site to the others after a large, possibly infinite,
number of hopping steps. Only computation with linear-time complexity is
required for the surface morphology calculation without other probabilistic
measures. The formalism is applied to simulate thin film growth on a
two-dimensional flat substrate and around a screw dislocation under the
modified Wolf--Villain diffusion rule. A rectangular spiral ridge is observed
in the latter case with a smooth front feature similar to that obtained from
simulations using the well-known multiple registration technique. An algorithm
to compute the inverse of a class of sub-stochastic matrices is derived as a
corollary.

accretion disks formed by the Type II collapsars. In these collapsars, massive
stars undergo core collapse to form a proto-neutron star initially and a mild
supernova explosion is driven. The supernova ejecta lack momentum and
subsequently this newly formed neutron star gets transformed to a stellar mass
black hole via massive fallback. The hydrodynamics and the nucleosynthesis in
these accretion disks has been studied extensively in the past. Several heavy
elements are synthesized in the disk and much of these heavy elements are
ejected from the disk via winds and outflows. We study nucleosynthesis in the
outflows launched from these disks by using an adiabatic, spherically expanding
outflow model, to understand which of these elements thus synthesized in the
disk survive in the outflow. While studying this we find that many new elements
like isotopes of titanium, copper, zinc etc. are present in the outflows. 56Ni
is abundantly synthesized in most of the cases in the outflow which implies
that the outflows from these disks in a majority of cases will lead to an
observable supernova explosion. It is mainly present when outflow is considered
from the He-rich, 56Ni/54Fe rich zones of the disks. However, outflow from the
Si-rich zone of the disk remains rich in silicon. Although, emission lines of
many of these heavy elements have been observed in the X-ray afterglows of
several GRBs by Chandra, BeppoSAX, XMM-Newton etc., Swift seems to have not

that conform, approximately, to a network structure referred to as scale-free.
Preferential attachment is one of many algorithms that have been introduced to
model the growth and structure of scale-free networks. With so many different
models of scale-free networks it is unclear what properties of scale-free
networks are typical, and what properties are peculiarities of a particular
growth or construction process. We propose a simple maximum entropy process
which provides the best representation of what are typical properties of
scale-free networks, and provides a standard against which real and
algorithmically generated networks can be compared. As an example we consider
preferential attachment and find that this particular growth model does not
yield typical realizations of scale-free networks. In particular, the widely
discussed ""fragility"" of scale-free networks is actually found to be due to the
peculiar ""hub-centric"" structure of preferential attachment networks. We
provide a method to generate or remove this latent hub-centric bias --- thereby
demonstrating exactly which features of preferential attachment networks are
atypical of the broader class of scale-free networks. We are also able to
statistically demonstrate whether real networks are typical realizations of
scale-free networks, or networks with that particular degree distribution;
using a new surrogate generation method for complex networks, exactly analogous

acting on the $(j,0)\oplus(0,j)$ representation of the HLG, we propose a
formalism for the description of high spin matter fields, based on the
projection over subspaces of well-defined parity. We identify two possibilities
for the projection, on-shell and off-shell projection. For all $j$ except for
$j=1/2$, we find that the projection does not completely fix the properties of
the interacting theory. This freedom is related to the fact that the covariant
form of parity can be written in terms of one of the symmetric traceless
tensors in the covariant basis and in general allows for a free magnetic dipole
term in the lagrangian. We gauge the theory and construct the charge
conjugation operator. In the case of bosons, the parity invariant subspaces are
also invariant under charge conjugation and time reversal and the formulation
of a quantum field theory can be done using only these subspaces. As a first
exhaustive example we work out the electrodynamics for $j=1$ matter bosons,
rewrite the theory in terms of an antisymmetric tensor field and compare our
results with existing formalisms in the literature. We find that there are
three essentially different formalisms: i) formalisms equivalent to the
on-shell parity projection, ii) formalisms equivalent to the off-shell parity
projection and iii) the Poincar\'e projector formalism which describes a
degenerate parity doublet. We perform a chiral decomposition of these theories
and show that chiral symmetry can be realized linearly only for the theory
based on the on-shell projection. Chiral symmetry forbids mass and anomalous
magnetic dipole terms and in general admits six self-interaction terms. We
conclude that this is the appropriate framework to attempt the incorporation of
spin 1 matter bosons in chiral theories like the standard model.

the sphere. The previous problem is related to the one to find the maximal

bipartite graphs with one side containing only nodes of degree two and induced
subgraphs of the famous Heawood or Petersen graph. Decompositions are node
cutsets consisting of one or two nodes and edge cutsets called 1-joins. Our

explicitly constructed, and gluing them together by prescribed composition
operations; and all graphs built this way are in ${\cal C}$.

maximum clique of any graph in $\cal C$ and an ${\cal O}(nm)$-time coloring

second main result is devoted to the construction of a Lyapunov functional

proof of the inequality. The key observation is that the inequality on the line
is equivalent to Sobolev's inequality on the sphere, at least when the
dimension is an integer, or to the critical interpolation inequality for the
ultraspherical operator in the general case. The time derivative of the
functional along the flow is itself very interesting. It explains the machinery
of some rigidity estimates for nonlinear elliptic equations and shows how
eigenvalues of a linearized problem enter in the computations. Notions of
gradient flows are then discussed for various notions of distances. Throughout
this paper we shall deal with two classes of inequalities corresponding either

The elliptical galaxy NGC 3923 is surrounded by numerous stellar
shells that are concentric arcs centered on the galactic core. They are very
likely a result of a minor merger and they consist of stars in nearly radial
orbits. For a given potential, the shell radii at a given time after the merger
can be calculated and compared to observations. The Modified Newtonian Dynamics
(MOND) is a theory that aims to solve the missing mass problem by modifying the
laws of classical dynamics in the limit of small accelerations. Hernquist &
Quinn(1987) claimed that the shell distribution of NGC 3923 contradicted MOND,
but Milgrom(1988) found several substantial insufficiencies in their work.
  Aims. We test whether the observed shell distribution in NGC 3923 is
consistent with MOND using the current observational knowledge of the shell
number and positions and of the host galaxy surface brightness profile, which
supersede the data available in the 1980s when the last (and negative) tests of
MOND viability were performed on NGC 3923.
  Methods. Using the 3.6 um bandpass image of NGC 3923 from the Spitzer space
telescope we construct the mass profile of the galaxy. The evolution of shell
radii in MOND is then computed using analytical formulae. We use 27 currently
observed shells and allow for their multi-generation formation, unlike the
Hernquist & Quinn one-generation model that used the 18 shells known at the
time.
  Results. Our model reproduces the observed shell radii with a maximum
deviation of 5% for 25 out of 27 known shells while keeping a reasonable
formation scenario. A multi-generation nature of the shell system, resulting
from successive passages of the surviving core of the tidally disrupted dwarf
galaxy, is one of key ingredients of our scenario supported by the extreme
shell radial range. The 25 reproduced shells are interpreted as belonging to
three generations.

Birkhoff conjecture and the isospectral rigidity of convex billiards. Both
these problems, in fact, can be conveniently translated into questions on this

facial muscles and blood vessels. These temperature changes can be regarded as
texture features of images. A comparative study of face recognition methods
working in thermal spectrum is carried out in this paper. In these study two
local-matching methods based on Haar wavelet transform and Local Binary Pattern
(LBP) are analyzed. Wavelet transform is a good tool to analyze multi-scale,
multi-direction changes of texture. Local binary patterns (LBP) are a type of
feature used for classification in computer vision. Firstly, human thermal IR
face image is preprocessed and cropped the face region only from the entire
image. Secondly, two different approaches are used to extract the features from
the cropped face region. In the first approach, the training images and the
test images are processed with Haar wavelet transform and the LL band and the
average of LH/HL/HH bands sub-images are created for each face image. Then a
total confidence matrix is formed for each face image by taking a weighted sum
of the corresponding pixel values of the LL band and average band. For LBP
feature extraction, each of the face images in training and test datasets is
divided into 161 numbers of sub images, each of size 8X8 pixels. For each such
sub images, LBP features are extracted which are concatenated in row wise
manner. PCA is performed separately on the individual feature set for
dimensionality reeducation. Finally two different classifiers are used to
classify face images. One such classifier multi-layer feed forward neural
network and another classifier is minimum distance classifier. The Experiments
have been performed on the database created at our own laboratory and Terravic

studies were traditionally restricted to analyses of low-precision visual
observations, and more recently, accurate ground-based data. Here we present an
overview of M giant variability on a wide range of time-scales (hours to
years), based on analysis of thirteen quarters of Kepler long-cadence
observations (one point per every 29.4 minutes), with a total time-span of over
1000 days. About two-thirds of the sample stars have been selected from the
ASAS-North survey of the Kepler field, with the rest supplemented from a
randomly chosen M giant control sample.
  We first describe the correction of the light curves from different quarters,
which was found to be essential. We use Fourier analysis to calculate multiple
frequencies for all stars in the sample. Over 50 stars show a relatively strong
signal with a period equal to the Kepler-year and a characteristic phase
dependence across the whole field-of-view. We interpret this as a so far
unidentified systematic effect in the Kepler data. We discuss the presence of
regular patterns in the distribution of multiple periodicities and amplitudes.
In the period-amplitude plane we find that it is possible to distinguish
between solar-like oscillations and larger amplitude pulsations which are
characteristic for Mira/SR stars. This may indicate the region of the
transition between two types of oscillations as we move upward along the giant
branch.

the Plateau de Bure Interferometer in its most extended configuration at 843mum
wavelength, we achieved a spatial resolution of 0.2""x0.17"", corresponding to
~500AU at a distance of 2.7\,kpc. Results: For the first time, we have observed
the fragmentation of the dense inner core of this region with at least three
subsources within the inner 3000 AU. The outflow exhibits blue- and red-shifted
emission on both sides of the central source indicating that the current
orientation has to be close to the line-of-sight, which differs from other
recent models. We observe rotational signatures in northeast-southwest
direction; however, even on scales of 500 AU, we do not identify any Keplerian
rotation signatures. This implies that during the early evolutionary stages any
stable Keplerian inner disk has to be very small (<=500 AU). The high-energy
line HCN(4-3)v2=1 (E_u/k=1050K) is detected over an extent of approximately
3000 AU. In addition to this, the detection of red-shifted absorption from this
line toward the central dust continuum peak position allows us to estimate
infall rates of ~1.8x10^(-3)Msun/yr on the smallest spatial scales. Although
all that gas will not necessarily be accreted onto the central protostar,
nevertheless, such inner core infall rates are among the best proxies of the
actual accretion rates one can derive during the early embedded star formation
phase. These data are consistent with collapse simulations and the observed
high multiplicity of massive stars.

implies that the theory is quantized in the (linear covariant) background field
method (BFM) gauge. Thus, the BFM and its associated background Ward identity
naturally emerge from antiBRST invariance of the theory and need not be
introduced as an ad hoc gauge fixing procedure. Treating ghosts and antighosts
on an equal footing, as required by a BRST-antiBRST invariant formulation of
the theory, gives also rise to a local antighost equation that together with
the local ghost equation completely resolve the algebraic structure of the
ghost sector for any value of the gauge fixing parameter. We finally prove that
the background fields are stationary points of the background effective action
obtained when the quantum fields are integrated out.

the warped outer region is studied. We consider the stage of evolution after
the planet has cleared-out a gap, so that the planetary orbit evolves only
under the gravitational potential from the disc. We develop a secular analysis
and compute the evolution of the orbital elements by solving Lagrange's
equations valid to second order in the eccentricity. We also perform numerical
simulations with the full disc potential. In general, the interaction between
the disc and the planet leads to the precession of the orbit. The orbital plane
therefore becomes tilted relative to the disc's inner parts, with no change in
the eccentricity. When the inclination approaches 90 degrees, there is an
instability and the eccentricity increases. In this case, both the inclination
and the eccentricity develop large variations, with the orbit becoming
retrograde. As the eccentricity reaches high values, we would expect tidal
capture on a short orbit of the planet by the star to occur. This instability
happens when the disc is severely warped, or if there is a significant amount
of mass in a ring inclined by at least 45 degrees relative to the initial
orbital plane. The inclination of the orbit does not depend on the semimajor
axis nor on the planet's mass. However, for a significant inclination to be
generated on a timescale of at most a few Myr, the planet should be beyond the
snow line. The process described here would therefore produce two distinct
populations of inclined planets: one with objects beyond the snow line with at
most moderate eccentricities, and another with objects on short circularized
orbits.

we obtain closed formulas for the one-level density for two families of
L-functions attached to elliptic curves. From those closed formulas, we can
determine the underlying symmetry types of the families. The one-level scaling
density for the first family corresponds to the orthogonal distribution as
predicted by the conjectures of Katz and Sarnak, and the one-level scaling
density for the second family is the sum of the Dirac distribution and the even
orthogonal distribution. This seems to be a new phenomenon, caused by the fact
that the curves of the second families have odd rank. Then, there is a trivial
zero at the central point which accounts for the Dirac distribution, and also
affects the remaining part of the scaling density which is then (maybe
surprisingly) the even orthogonal distribution. The one-level density for this
second family was studied in the past for test functions with Fourier
transforms of small support, but since the Fourier transforms of the even
orthogonal and odd orthogonal distributions are undistinguishable for small
support, it was not possible to identify the distribution with those
techniques. This can be done with the ratios conjectures, and it sheds more
light on ""independent"" and ""non-independent"" zeroes and the repulsion
phenomenon.

exploit the deep L-band radio continuum image (with noise 11 \mu Jy/beam) to
identify galaxies with radio continuum emission. Infrared properties are
extracted from the Spitzer catalog. We detect HI in blue galaxies, but HI is
also detected in the group of red galaxies - albeit with smaller amounts than
for the blue sample. We identify a group of optically inactive galaxies with
early-type morphology that does not reveal any HI and ionized gas. These
inactive galaxies likely represent the genuine red and dead galaxies depleted
of all gas. Unlike inactive galaxies, HI is detected in red LINER-like objects.
Galaxies with radio continuum counterparts mostly belong to the sub-mJy
population, whose objects are thought to be a mixture of star-forming galaxies
and low-power AGNs. After using several AGN diagnostics, we conclude that the
radio emission in the majority of our sub-mJy radio sources stems from star
formation. LINERs appear to separate into two groups based on IR properties and
HI content. LINERs with a 24 \mu m detection show relatively large amounts of
HI and are also often detected in radio continuum as a result of ongoing star
formation. The LINER galaxies which are not detected at 24 \mu m are more like
the optically inactive galaxies by being depleted of HI gas and having no sign

large graphs, with hundreds of millions of vertices and edges. This volume of
information requires partitioning the graph across multiple nodes in a
distributed system. This has a deep effect on performance, as traversing edges
cut between partitions incurs a significant performance penalty due to the cost
of communication. Thus, several systems in the literature have attempted to
improve computational performance by enhancing graph partitioning, but they do
not support another characteristic of real-world graphs: graphs are inherently
dynamic, their topology evolves continuously, and subsequently the optimum
partitioning also changes over time.
  In this work, we present the first system that dynamically repartitions
massive graphs to adapt to structural changes. The system optimises graph
partitioning to prevent performance degradation without using data replication.
The system adopts an iterative vertex migration algorithm that relies on local
information only, making complex coordination unnecessary. We show how the
improvement in graph partitioning reduces execution time by over 50%, while
adapting the partitioning to a large number of changes to the graph in three
real-world scenarios.

recently developed in the frameworks of twisted and modular spectral triples.
First we compute the spectral dimension, using an appropriate weight, and show
that in general it coincides with the classical one. We also study the

Then we compare this notion of dimension with the one coming from homology. To
this end, we compute the twisted Hochschild dimension of the universal

avoids the dimension drop, similarly to other examples coming from quantum

The impact energy stored in the splash structures was estimated via a

rapidly through shear-thinning fluids, but is this behavior generic to all
microscopic swimmers, and what are the physics through which shear-thinning
rheology affects a swimmer's propulsion? We examine swimmers employing
prescribed stroke kinematics in two-dimensional, inertialess Carreau fluid:
shear-thinning ""Generalized Stokes"" flow. Swimmers are modeled, using the
method of femlets, by a set of immersed, regularized forces. The equations
governing the fluid dynamics are then discretized over a body-fitted mesh and
solved with the finite element method. We analyze the locomotion of three
distinct classes of microswimmer: (1) conceptual swimmers comprising sliding
spheres employing both one- and two-dimensional strokes, (2) slip-velocity
envelope models of ciliates commonly referred to as ""squirmers"" and (3)
monoflagellate pushers, such as sperm. We find that morphologically identical
swimmers with different strokes may swim either faster or slower in
shear-thinning fluids than in Newtonian fluids. We explain this kinematic
sensitivity by considering differences in the viscosity of the fluid
surrounding propulsive and payload elements of the swimmer, and using this
insight suggest two reciprocal sliding sphere swimmers which violate Purcell's
Scallop theorem in shear-thinning fluids. We also show that an increased flow
decay rate arising from shear-thinning rheology is associated with a reduction
in the swimming speed of slip-velocity squirmers. For sperm-like swimmers, a
gradient of thick to thin fluid along the flagellum alters the force it exerts
upon the fluid, flattening trajectories and increasing instantaneous swimming
speed.

transport associated with morphogenesis is modulated by the gradual emergence

distributions within a body-conforming finite element framework, allowing the

both cases swimming due to a prescribed beat is enhanced by shear-thinning,
with optimal Deborah number around 0.8. The sperm exhibits an almost perfect

detector accepts an image and produces a list of locations as $(x,y)$ pairs.

boosting differs from previous boosting algorithms because it optimizes a new
spatial loss function to combine object detectors, each of which may have
marginal performance, into a single, more accurate object detector. A
structured representation of object locations as a list of $(x,y)$ pairs is a
more natural domain for object detection than the spatially unstructured

to take advantage of the intuition that large areas of the background are
uninteresting and it is not worth expending computational effort on them. This
results in a more scalable algorithm because it does not need to take measures

employed by MiniBooNE to make event rate predictions using simulations on the
MiniBooNE target material CH$_{2}$. The axial mass is a free parameter in all

using cross section results. The large axial mass problem makes it necessary
for experiments to perform their own axial mass fits, but a prior fit to the
same dataset could mask a sterile oscillation signal if the sterile and cross
section model parameters are not independent. We find that for the NCEL dataset
there are significant correlations between the sterile and cross section model
parameters, making a fit to both models simultaneously necessary to get robust
results. Failure to do this results in stronger than warranted limits on the

for hot dwarfs and using $\log g $. The accuracy of the calibration is tested
against Hipparcos stars with better than 2% parallax errors, and by comparison
of the RAVE velocity distribution with that of Hipparcos, and is found to
improve upon previous estimates of luminosity distance. An estimate of the LSR

object and they do not consider the energies reflected from an object. Objects
living or non-living emit different amounts of IR energy according to their
body temperature and characteristics. Humans are homoeothermic and hence
capable of maintaining constant temperature under different surrounding
temperature. Face recognition from thermal (IR) images should focus on changes
of temperature on facial blood vessels. These temperature changes can be
regarded as texture features of images and wavelet transform is a very good
tool to analyze multi-scale and multi-directional texture. Wavelet transform is
also used for image dimensionality reduction, by removing redundancies and
preserving original features of the image. The sizes of the facial images are
normally large. So, the wavelet transform is used before image similarity is
measured. Therefore this paper describes an efficient approach of human face
recognition based on wavelet transform from thermal IR images. The system
consists of three steps. At the very first step, human thermal IR face image is
preprocessed and the face region is only cropped from the entire image.
Secondly, Haar wavelet is used to extract low frequency band from the cropped
face region. Lastly, the image classification between the training images and
the test images is done, which is based on low-frequency components. The
proposed approach is tested on a number of human thermal infrared face images
created at our own laboratory and Terravic Facial IR Database. Experimental
results indicated that the thermal infra red face images can be recognized by
the proposed system effectively. The maximum success of 95% recognition has
been achieved.

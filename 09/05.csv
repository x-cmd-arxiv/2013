  spectra using the damped-oscillator oscillator detector (DOOD)","25 pages, 10 figures",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Objective: The surgical resection of brain areas with high rates of visually
identified high frequency oscillations (HFOs) on EEG has been correlated with
improved seizure control. However, it can be difficult to distinguish normal
from pathological HFOs, and the visual detection of HFOs is very
time-intensive. An automated algorithm for detecting HFOs and for wide-band
spectral analysis is desirable.
  Methods: The damped-oscillator oscillator detector (DOOD) is adapted for HFO
detection, and tested on recordings from one rat and one human. The rat data
consist of recordings from the hippocampus just prior to induction of status
epilepticus, and again 6 weeks after induction, after the rat is epileptic. The
human data are temporal lobe depth electrode recordings from a patient who
underwent pre-surgical evaluation.
  Results: Sensitivities and positive predictive values are presented which
depend on specifying a threshold value for HFO detection. Wide-band
time-frequency and HFO-associated frequency spectra are also presented. In the
rat data, four high frequency bands are identified at 80-250 Hz, 250-500 Hz,
600-900 Hz and 1000-3000 Hz. The human data was low-passed filtered at 1000 Hz
and showed HFO-associated bands at 15 Hz, 85 Hz, 400 Hz and 700 Hz.
  Conclusion: The DOOD algorithm is capable of high resolution time-frequency
spectra, and it can be adapted to detect HFOs with high positive predictive
value. HFO-associated wide-band data show intricate low-frequency structure.
  Significance: DOOD may ease the labor intensity of HFO detection. DOOD
wide-band analysis may in future help distinguish normal from pathological
HFOs.

a vector space over a finite field, and randomly picking a low-degree curve in
it as the sample. Curve samplers exhibit a nice property besides the sampling
property: the restriction of low-degree polynomials over the domain to the
sampled curve is still low-degree. This property is often used in combination
with the sampling property and has found many applications, including PCP
constructions, local decoding of codes, and algebraic PRG constructions.
  The randomness complexity of curve samplers is a crucial parameter for its
applications. It is known that (non-explicit) curve samplers using $O(\log
N+\log(1/\delta))$ random bits exist, where $N$ is the domain size and $\delta$
is the confidence error. The question of explicitly constructing
randomness-efficient curve samplers was first raised in \cite{TU06} where they
obtained curve samplers with near-optimal randomness complexity.
  We present an explicit construction of low-degree curve samplers with {\em
optimal} randomness complexity (up to a constant factor), sampling curves of
degree $\left(m\log_q(1/\delta)\right)^{O(1)}$ in $\mathbb{F}_q^m$. Our
construction is a delicate combination of several components, including
extractor machinery, limited independence, iterated sampling, and
list-recoverable codes.

this protocol entanglement farming. It consists of successively sending pairs
of unentangled particles through an optical cavity. Using non-perturbative
Gaussian methods, we show that in certain generic circumstances this protocol
drives the cavity field towards a non-thermal metastable state. This state of
the cavity is such that successive pairs of unentangled particles sent through
the cavity will reliably emerge significantly entangled. We calculate
thermodynamic aspects of the harvesting process, such as energies and
entropies, and also the long-term behavior beyond the few-mode approximation.
Significant for possible experimental realizations is the fact that this
entangling fixed point state of the cavity is reached largely independently of
the initial state in which the cavity was prepared. Our results suggest that
reliable entanglement farming on the basis of such a fixed point state should
be possible also in various other experimental settings, namely with the
to-be-entangled particles replaced by arbitrary qudits and with the cavity
replaced by a suitable reservoir system.

few hundred million years after the Big Bang. The direct collapse of
protogalactic gas clouds in primordial halos with $\rm T_{vir} \geq 10^{4} K$
provides the most promising way to assemble massive black holes. In this study,
we aim to determine the characteristic mass scale of seed black holes and the
time evolution of the accretion rates resulting from the direct collapse model.
We explore the formation of supermassive black holes via cosmological large
eddy simulations (LES) by employing sink particles and following their
evolution for twenty thousand years after the formation of the first sink. As
the resulting protostars were shown to have cool atmospheres in the presence of
strong accretion, we assume here that UV feedback is negligible during this
calculation. We confirm this result in a comparison run without sinks. Our
findings show that black hole seeds with characteristic mass of $\rm 10^{5}
M_{\odot}$ are formed in the presence of strong Lyman Werner flux which leads
to an isothermal collapse. The characteristic mass is a about two times higher
in LES compared to the implicit large eddy simulations (ILES). The accretion
rates increase with time and reach a maximum value of 10 $\rm M_{\odot}/yr$
after $\rm 10^{4}$ years. Our results show that the direct collapse model is
clearly feasible as it provides the expected mass of the seed black holes.

$T_{VBS}$ the in-plane $c$-axis, along which the valence bonds form, contracts
while the second in-plane $a$-axis elongates by the same relative amount.
Surprisingly, the dominant effect is observed for the out-of-plane $b$-axis

anomaly in $\alpha_i$ around 40\,K is attributed to short-range magnetic

point is due to the degeneracy of the symmetric and the asymmetric eigenmodes
of the coupled surface plasmon polaritons. The optical nonlocality induced
epsilon-near-zero frequency shift for the multilayer stack compared to the
effective medium is studied. Furthermore, the giant optical nonlocality around
the Dirac point is explored with the iso-frequency contour analysis, while the
beam splitting phenomenon at the Dirac point due to the optical nonlocal effect

behavior in communication and computing systems, in this paper, we investigate
the fundamental benefit of predictive scheduling, i.e., predicting and
pre-serving arrivals, in controlled queueing systems. Based on a lookahead
window prediction model, we first establish a novel equivalence between the
predictive queueing system with a \emph{fully-efficient} scheduling scheme and
an equivalent queueing system without prediction. This connection allows us to
analytically demonstrate that predictive scheduling necessarily improves system
delay performance and can drive it to zero with increasing prediction power. We
then propose the \textsf{Predictive Backpressure (PBP)} algorithm for achieving
optimal utility performance in such predictive systems. \textsf{PBP}
efficiently incorporates prediction into stochastic system control and avoids
the great complication due to the exponential state space growth in the
prediction window size. We show that \textsf{PBP} can achieve a utility
performance that is within $O(\epsilon)$ of the optimal, for any $\epsilon>0$,
while guaranteeing that the system delay distribution is a
\emph{shifted-to-the-left} version of that under the original Backpressure
algorithm. Hence, the average packet delay under \textsf{PBP} is strictly
better than that under Backpressure, and vanishes with increasing prediction
window size. This implies that the resulting utility-delay tradeoff with
predictive scheduling beats the known optimal $[O(\epsilon),
O(\log(1/\epsilon))]$ tradeoff for systems without prediction.

that anomalies in the spatial Weyl symmetry will arise upon quantization. The
purpose of this short paper is to establish the tools required for an
investigation of the sort of anomalies that can possibly arise. The first step
is to adapt to our setting Barnich and Henneaux's formulation of gauge
cohomology in the Hamiltonian setting, which serve to decompose the anomaly
into a spatial component and time component. The spatial part of the anomaly,
i.e. the anomaly in the symmetry algebra itself ($[\Omega, \Omega]\propto
\hbar$ instead of vanishing) is given by a projection of the second ghost
cohomology of the Hamiltonian BRST differential associated to $\Omega$, modulo
spatial derivatives. The temporal part, $[\Omega, H]\propto\hbar$ is given by a
different projection of the first ghost cohomology and an extra piece arising
from a solution to a functional differential equation. Assuming locality of the
gauge cohomology groups involved, this part is always local. Assuming locality
for the gauge cohomology groups, using Barnich and Henneaux's results, the
classification of Weyl cohomology for higher ghost numbers performed by
Boulanger, and following the descent equations, we find a complete
characterizations of anomalies in 3+1 dimensions. The spatial part of the
anomaly and the first component of the temporal anomaly are always local given
these assumptions even in shape dynamics. The part emerging from the solution
of the functional differential equations explicitly involves the shape dynamics
Hamiltonian, and thus might be non-local. If one restricts this extra piece of
the temporal anomaly to be also local, then overall no \emph{local} Weyl
anomalies, either temporal or spatial, emerge in the 3+1 case.

enough to satisfy the bound from Planck if the dominant modulation of the
inflaton decay rate is linear in the modulating field $\sigma$. $\sigma$ must
then acquire a spatially-modulated power spectrum with a red scale-dependence.
This can be achieved if the primordial perturbation of $\sigma$ is generated
via tachyonic growth of a complex scalar field. Modulated reheating due to
$\sigma$ then produces a spatially modulated and scale-dependent sub-dominant
contribution to the adiabatic density perturbation. We show that it is possible
to account for the observed asymmetry while remaining consistent with bounds
from quasar number counts, non-Gaussianity and the CMB temperature quadupole.
The model predicts that the adiabatic perturbation spectral index and its
running will be modified by the modulated reheating component.

decoherence in the common case when the many-body electronic density matrix is
not known and only reduced information about the electronic subsystem is
available. Being defined from reduced electronic quantities, the interpretation
of the reduced purities is more intricate than the usual (many-body) purity.
This is because the nonidempotency of the $r$-body reduced electronic density

explicit expressions are provided for the one-body and two-body reduced

analytical expressions have not been previously derived. The method is
illustrated for both flat planes and corrugated planes which are exemplified by
{11-22} and {10-12} twinning modes, respectively. The method distinguishes
between shuffle displacements and net shuffles. While shuffle displacements
correspond to movements between ideal atom positions in the parent and twin
lattices, net shuffles comprise contributions from shear on overlying planes
which can operate along opposite directions to those of shuffle displacements.
Thus, net shuffles in the twinning direction can vanish in a limiting case, as
is interestingly the case for those needed in the second plane by the b_4

displacement vectors can be irrational when K_1 is corrugated, net shuffle
vectors are always rational.

or environment is a powerful test for galaxy formation models. Here we use
integral-field stellar kinematics to interpret the variation of the mass-size
distribution in two galaxy samples spanning extreme environmental densities.
The samples are both identically and nearly mass-selected (stellar mass M*>6e9
Msun) and volume-limited. The first consists of nearby field galaxies from the
Atlas3D parent sample. The second consists of galaxies in the Coma Cluster
(Abell 1656), one of densest environments for which good resolved spectroscopy
can be obtained. The mass-size distribution in the dense environment differs
from the field one in two ways: (i) spiral galaxies are replaced by
bulge-dominated disk-like fast-rotator early-type galaxies (ETGs), which follow
the SAME mass-size relation and have the SAME mass distribution as in the field
sample; (ii) the slow rotator ETGs are segregated in mass from the fast
rotators, with their size increasing proportionally to their mass. A transition
between the two processes appears around the stellar mass M_crit=2e11 Msun. We
interpret this as evidence for bulge growth (outside-in evolution) and
bulge-related environmental quenching dominating at low masses, with little
influence from merging, while significant dry mergers (inside-out evolution)
and halo-related quenching driving the mass and size growth at the high-mass
end. The existence of these two processes naturally explains the diverse size
evolution of galaxies of different masses and the separability of mass and
environmental quenching.

spurious radiation (or junk radiation) resulting from the initial data not
matching astrophysical quasi-equilibrium inspiral exactly. One traditionally
waits for the junk radiation to exit the computational domain before taking
physical readings, at the expense of throwing away a segment of the evolution,
and with the hope that junk radiation exits cleanly. We argue that this hope
does not necessarily pan out as junk radiation could excite long-lived
constraint violation. Another complication with the initial data is that it
contains orbital eccentricity that needs to be removed, usually by evolving the
early part of the inspiral multiple times with gradually improved input
parameters. We show that this procedure is also adversely impacted by junk
radiation. In this paper, we do not attempt to eliminate junk radiation
directly, but instead tackle the much simpler problem of ameliorating its
long-lasting effects. We report on the success of a method that achieves this
goal by combining the removal of junk radiation and eccentricity into a single
""joint-elimination"" procedure. This approach has the following benefits: (1) We
do not have to contend with the influence of junk radiation on eccentricity
measurements for later iterations of the eccentricity reduction procedure. (2)
We re-enforce constraints periodically by invoking the initial data solver,
removing the constraint violation excited by junk radiation previously. (3) The
wasted simulation segment associated with the junk radiation's evolution is
absorbed into the eccentricity reduction iterations. Furthermore, (1) and (2)
together allow us to carry out our joint-elimination procedure at low
resolution, even when the subsequent ""production run"" is intended as a high
resolution simulation.

code to constrain the temperature (T_kin), density (n(H2)) and column density
(N(12CO)) of the molecular gas. We find that the most probable scenario for the
eastern nucleus is a cold (T_kin = 38 K), moderately dense (n(H2) = 10^2.89
cm^-3) molecular gas component. We find the most probable 12CO to 13CO
abundance ratio ([12CO]/[13CO]) is 229, roughly three times higher than the
Milky Way value. This high abundance ratio may explain the observed high 12CO/
13CO line ratio (> 25). The unusual 13CO J=2-1/J=1-0 line ratio of 0.6 is
produced by a combination of moderate 13CO optical depths (tau = 0.4 - 1.1) and
extremely subthermal excitation temperatures. We measure the CO-to-H2
conversion factor, alpha_co to be 0.5 M_sol (K km s^-1 pc^2)^-1, which agrees
with the widely used factor for ultra luminous infrared galaxies of Downes &

superhorizon scales, modulating the preheating process at the end of inflation.
Consequently, the amplitude of the gravitational wave (GW) background produced
during preheating will also be modulated. The observed energy density of this
background will therefore appear anisotropic at different angles in the sky. We
provide a master formula for the angular power spectrum C_l of the anisotropies
in the GW background from preheating, valid for any scenario where the
anisotropies are due to the superhorizon modulation of a light degree of
freedom. Using lattice field theory simulations of massless preheating with
g^2/\lambda = 2, we find a flat angular spectrum l(l+1)C_l \approx 3x10^{-4},
which represents a strong anisotropy of order 1% variations on large angular
scales. For our choice of couplings, long wavelengths are amplified most
strongly during parametric resonance, which is crucial for the development of
the anisotropies. If future direct detection GW observatories are capable of
detecting backgrounds of cosmological origin, they should be able to detect
this effect. This could eventually become a powerful tool to discriminate among
inflationary and preheating scenarios.

2010), aims for protecting the integrity of information against tampering
attacks in situations where error-detection is impossible. Intuitively,
information encoded by a non-malleable code either decodes to the original
message or, in presence of any tampering, to an unrelated message. Dziembowski
et al. show existence of non-malleable codes for any class of tampering
functions of bounded size.
  We consider constructions of coding schemes against two well-studied classes
of tampering functions: bit-wise tampering functions (where the adversary
tampers each bit of the encoding independently) and split-state adversaries
(where two independent adversaries arbitrarily tamper each half of the encoded
sequence).
  1. For bit-tampering, we obtain explicit and efficiently encodable and
decodable codes of length $n$ achieving rate $1-o(1)$ and error (security)
$\exp(-\tilde{\Omega}(n^{1/7}))$. We improve the error to
$\exp(-\tilde{\Omega}(n))$ at the cost of making the construction Monte Carlo
with success probability $1-\exp(-\Omega(n))$. Previously, the best known
construction of bit-tampering codes was the Monte Carlo construction of
Dziembowski et al. (ICS 2010) achieving rate ~.1887.
  2. We initiate the study of seedless non-malleable extractors as a variation
of non-malleable extractors introduced by Dodis and Wichs (STOC 2009). We show
that construction of non-malleable codes for the split-state model reduces to
construction of non-malleable two-source extractors. We prove existence of such
extractors, which implies that codes obtained from our reduction can achieve
rates arbitrarily close to 1/5 and exponentially small error. Currently, the
best known explicit construction of split-state coding schemes is due to
Aggarwal, Dodis and Lovett (ECCC TR13-081) which only achieves vanishing
(polynomially small) rate.

equilibrium distribution. We find that the same qualitative results hold under
Fisher's geometric model. We also provide a simple intuition for the surprising
prevalence of unconditionally deleterious substitutions during early
adaptation. Importantly, the phenomenon we describe occurs on fitness
landscapes without any local maxima and is therefore distinct from
""valley-crossing"". Our results imply that the common practice of ignoring
deleterious substitutions leads to qualitatively incorrect predictions in many
regimes. Our results also have implications for the substitution process at
equilibrium and for the response to a sudden decrease in population size.

(VPOS), a thin plane perpendicular to the MW disc. Proper motion (PM)
measurements are now available for all of the 11 brightest, `classical'
satellites and allow an updated analysis of the alignment of their orbital
poles with this spatial structure. The coherent orbital alignment of 7 to 9 out
of 11 satellites demonstrates that the VPOS is a rotationally stabilized
structure and not only a pressure-supported, flattened ellipsoid. This allows
us to empirically and model independently predict the PMs of almost all
satellite galaxies by assuming that the MW satellite galaxies orbit within the
VPOS. As a test of our method, the predictions are best met by satellites whose
PMs are already well constrained, as expected because more uncertain
measurements tend to deviate more from the true values. Improved and new PM
measurements will further test these predictions. A strong alignment of the
satellite galaxy orbital poles is not expected in dark matter based simulations
of galaxy formation. Coherent orbital directions of satellite galaxies are,
however, a natural consequence of tidal dwarf galaxies formed together in the
debris of a galaxy collision. The orbital poles of the MW satellite galaxies
therefore lend further support to tidal scenarios for the origin of the VPOS
and are a very significant challenge for the standard LCDM model of cosmology.
We also note that the dependence of the MW satellite speeds on Galactocentric
distance appear to map an effective potential with a constant velocity of
approximately 240 km/s to about 250 kpc. The individual satellite velocities

implies that once we know the correct distances to the observed BAO, the tip
points of baryon acoustic peaks in the anisotropic correlation function of
galaxies, $\xi(\sigma,\pi)$, can form a great circle (hereafter 2D BAO circle)
in the $\sigma$ and $\pi$ plane, where $\sigma$ and $\pi$ are the separation of

(M_{tot}\sim4\times10^{12}M_{\sun}), covering the virial radius out to 310 kpc.
We perform detailed completeness estimations and select group member candidates
by a combination of automated object detection and visual inspection. A
fiducial sample of 48 member candidates down to M_R -10.5 mag is detected,
making this study the deepest of a fossil group up to now. We investigate the
photometric scaling relations, the colour-magnitude relation, and the
luminosity function of our galaxy sample. We find evidence of recent and
ongoing merger events among bright group galaxies. The colour-magnitude
relation is comparable to that of nearby galaxy clusters, and exhibits
significant scatter at the faintest luminosities. The completeness-corrected
luminosity function is dominated by early-type dwarfs and is characterized by a
faint end slope \alpha=-1.32\pm0.05. We conclude that the NGC 6482 fossil group
shows photometric properties consistent with those of regular galaxy clusters
and groups, including a normal abundance of faint satellites.

identification of emission lines of [OII], [OIII] and H-alpha from the host
galaxy of the GRB. This implies an energy release of Eiso = (3.0+/-0.2)x10^54

is hosted by a luminous galaxy, which we also proof to be compact, with a very
intense star formation. It is one of the most luminous host galaxies associated
with a GRB, showing that the host galaxies of long GRBs are not always blue

local H\alpha\ emission as an indicator of young environments. The Nearby
Supernova Factory has obtained flux-calibrated spectral timeseries for SNe Ia
using integral field spectroscopy, allowing the simultaneous measurement of the
SN and its immediate vicinity. For 89 SNe Ia we measure H\alpha\ emission
tracing ongoing star formation within a 1 kpc radius around each SN. This
constitutes the first direct study of the local environment for a large sample
of SNe Ia also having accurate luminosity, color and stretch measurements. We
find that SNe Ia with local H\alpha\ emission are redder by 0.036+/-0.017 mag,
and that the previously-noted correlation between stretch and host mass is
entirely driven by the SNe Ia coming from passive regions. Most importantly,
the mean standardized brightness for SNe Ia with local H\alpha\ emission is
0.094+/-0.031 mag fainter than for those without. This offset arises from a
bimodal structure in the Hubble residuals, that also explains the
previously-known host-mass bias. We combine this bimodality with the cosmic
star-formation rate to predict changes with redshift in the mean SN Ia
brightness and the host-mass bias. This change is confirmed using high-redshift
SNe Ia from the literature. These environmental dependences point to remaining
systematic errors in SNe Ia standardization. The observed brightness offset is
predicted to cause a significant bias in measurements of the dark energy
equation of state. Recognition of these effects offers new opportunities to
improve SNe Ia as cosmological probes - e.g. SNe Ia having local H\alpha\
emission are more homogeneous, having a brightness dispersion of 0.105+/-0.012

0.15 < z < 0.4 in the SDSS to investigate how the stacked stellar mass fraction
varies across a wide range of total mass, $M_{500}$. Our study improves upon
previous observational studies in a number of important ways, including having
a much larger sample size, an explicit inclusion of the intracluster light
(ICL) component, and a thorough examination of the accuracy of our total mass
estimates via comparisons to simulations and weak lensing observations. We find
that the stellar mass fraction depends only weakly on total mass and that the
contribution of ICL to the total stellar mass fraction is significant
(typically 20-40 per cent). Both of these findings are in excellent accordance
with the predictions of cosmological simulations. Under the assumption of a
Chabrier (Salpeter) IMF, the derived star formation efficiency
($f_{star}$/$f_{b}$, where $f_b=\Omega_b/\Omega_m$) is relatively low at 8 per
cent (14 per cent) and is consistent with the global star formation efficiency
of semi-analytic models that reproduce the galaxy stellar mass function. When
our measured stellar mass fractions are combined with the observed relation
between hot gas mass fraction and total mass from X-ray observations, our
results imply that galaxy groups have significantly lower baryon fractions than
massive clusters. Ejection of gas due to energetic AGN feedback (most likely at
high redshift) provides a plausible mechanism for explaining the trends we
observe.

important role in the geometry of Fano varieties. Tian showed that Fano
manifolds with big alpha-invariant can be equipped with a Kahler-Einstein
metric. In recent years Donaldson drafted a programme to determine when a
smooth Fano variety X admits a Kahler-Einstein metric. It was conjectured that
the existence of such a metric is equivalent to X being K-stable, an
algebraic-geometric property. A crucial step in Donaldson's programme consists
on finding a Kahler-Einstein metric with edge singularities of small angle
along a smooth anticanonical boundary. Jeffres, Mazzeo and Rubinstein showed
that a dynamic version of the alpha-invariant could be used to find such
metrics.
  The global log canonical threshold measures how anticanonical pairs fail to
be log canonical. In this thesis we compute the global log canonical threshold
of del Pezzo surfaces in various settings. We extend Cheltsov's computation of
the global log canonical threshold of complex del Pezzo surfaces to
non-singular del Pezzo surfaces over a ground field which is algebraically
closed and has arbitrary characteristic. Then we study which anticanonical
pairs fail to be log canonical, giving a classification of very singular
anticanonical pairs for del Pezzo surfaces of small degree. We conjecture under
which circumstances such a classification is plausible for an arbitrary Fano
variety and derive consequences. As an application, we compute the dynamic
alpha-invariant on smooth del Pezzo surfaces of small degree with any smooth
elliptic curve as boundary.
  The main result of this thesis is a computation of the dynamic
alpha-invariant on all smooth del Pezzo surfaces with boundary any smooth
elliptic curve C. The values of the alpha-invariant depend on the choice of C.
We apply our computation to find Kahler-Einstein metrics with edge
singularities.

of hard spheres or rods to dilute suspensions of hard spheres and depletants.
Entropic ordering of anisotropic shapes into complex crystals, liquid crystals,
and even quasicrystals has been demonstrated recently in computer simulations
and experiments. The ordering of shapes appears to arise from the emergence of
directional entropic forces (DEFs) that align neighboring particles, but these
forces have been neither rigorously defined nor quantified in generic systems.
Here, we show quantitatively that shape drives the phase behavior of systems of
anisotropic particles upon crowding through DEFs. We define DEFs in generic
systems, and compute them for several hard particle systems. We show that they
are on the order of a few kT at the onset of ordering, placing DEFs on par with
traditional depletion, van der Waals, and other intrinsic interactions. In
experimental systems with these other interactions, we provide direct
quantitative evidence that entropic effects of shape also contribute to
self-assembly. We use DEFs to draw a distinction between self-assembly and
packing behavior. We show that the mechanism that generates directional
entropic forces is the maximization of entropy by optimizing local particle
packing. We show that this mechanism occurs in a wide class of systems, and we
treat, in a unified way, the entropy-driven phase behavior of arbitrary shapes
incorporating the well-known works of Kirkwood, Onsager, and Asakura and
Oosawa.

ill-behaviour of gauge fixing conditions, one example being the gauge in which
theory is classically equivalent to standard General Relativity. The main
conclusions of our analysis are: (1) singularities signal a phase transition
from broken to unbroken phase of Weyl symmetry, (2) instead of a singularity
there is a ""baby-universe"" or a white hole inside a black hole, (3) in the baby
universe scenario there is a critical mass after which reducing mass makes
black hole larger as viewed by outside observers, (4) if a black hole could be
connected with white hole through the ""singularity"", this would require
breakdown of (classical) geometric description, (5) the singularity of
Schwarzschild BH solution is non-generic and so it is dangerous to rely on it
in deriving general results. Our results may have important consequences for
resolving issues related to information-loss puzzle. The theory we use is
basically a completion of General Relativity, containing neither additional
physical excitations nor higher-derivative terms, but requires physical scalar
field such as Higgs field of Standard Model. Though quantum effects are still
crucial and may change the proposed classical picture, a position of building
quantum theory around essentially regular classical solutions normally provides
a much better starting point.

matter halo membership and energy to classify our galaxy pairs. In terms of
halo membership, central-satellite pairs tend to be in isolation (in relation
to external more massive galaxies), are energetically- bound to each other, and
are also weakly-bound to a neighbouring massive galaxy. Satellite-satellite
pairs, instead, inhabit regions in close proximity to a more massive galaxy,
are energetically-unbound, and are often bound to that neighbour. We find that
60% of our paired galaxies are bound to both their companion and to a third
external object. Moreover, only 9% of our pairs resemble the kind of systems
described by idealised binary merger simulations in complete isolation. In sum,
we demonstrate the importance of properly connecting galaxy pairs to the rest

The CT AGN account for ~ 38% of the total accreted SMBH mass and contribute ~

body as determined by the Radau-Darwin Approximation (RDA) to its exact
hydrostatic MOI calculated to first order in the parameter q = w^2R^3/GM, where
w, R, and M are the spin angular velocity, radius, and mass of the body, and G
is the gravitational constant. RDA is in error by less than 1% for many
configurations of core sizes and layer densities congruent with those of solid
bodies in the Solar System. We determine the error in the MOI of icy satellites
calculated with the RDA due to nonhydrostatic effects by using a simple model
in which the core and outer shell have slight degree 2 distortions away from
their expected hydrostatic shapes. Since the hydrostatic shape has an
associated stress of order pw^2R^2 (where p is density) it follows that the
importance of nonhydrostatic effects scales with the dimensionless number
s/pw^2R^2, where s is the nonhydrostatic stress. This highlights the likely
importance of this error for slowly rotating bodies (e.g., Titan and Callisto)
and small bodies (e.g., Saturn moons other than Titan). We apply this model to
Titan, Callisto, and Enceladus and find that the RDA-derived MOI can be 10%
greater than the actual MOI for nonhydrostatic stresses as small as ~0.1 bars
at the surface or ~1 bar at the core-mantle boundary, while for Ganymede the
stresses necessary to produce the same MOI errors are an order of magnitude
greater due to its faster rotation. If satellites can reorient to the lowest
energy state then RDA will always give an overestimate of the true MOI.
Observations have shown that small nonhydrostatic gravity anomalies exist on
Ganymede and Titan. We conclude that nonhydrostatic effects could be present to
an extent that allows Callisto and Titan to be fully differentiated.

$\kappa$ which is close to normal LERW in Euclidean lattice. However our
results reveal that the LERW on critical incipient percolation clusters is
compatible with SLE, but with another diffusivity coefficient $\kappa$. Several
geometrical tests are applied to ascertain this. All calculations are
consistent with $\mathrm{SLE}_{\kappa}$, where $\kappa=1.732\pm0.016$. This
value of the diffusivity coefficient is outside of the well-known duality range

decreasing the value of the parameter $p$ from 1 to $p_c$. For finite systems,
two crossover exponents and a scaling relation can be derived. We believe that

K hotter than its quiescent value at three years post outburst, and still a few
hundred degrees hotter at four years post outburst. The white dwarf spin at
67.6 s and its second harmonic at 33.8 s are visible in the optical within a
month of outburst and are obvious in the later UV observations in the shortest
wavelength continuum and the UV emission lines, indicating an origin in high
temperature regions near the accretion curtains. The UV light curves folded on
the spin period show a double-humped modulation consistent with two-pole
accretion. The optical photometry two years after outburst shows a group of
frequencies present at shorter periods (250-263 s) than the periods ascribed to
pulsation at quiescence, and these gradually shift toward the quiescent
frequencies (300-360 s) as time progresses past outburst. The most surprising
result is that the frequencies near this period in the UV data are only
prominent in the emission lines, not the UV continuum, implying an origin away
from the white dwarf photosphere. Thus, the connection of this group of periods
with non-radial pulsations of the white dwarf remains elusive.

combination of SPH simulations and direct N-body simulations. We start by
performing SPH simulations of the giant molecular cloud with a turbulent
velocity field, a mass of $4\times10^4$ to $5\times10^6M_{\odot}$, and a
density between $1.7\times10^3$ and $170cm^{-3}$. We continue the SPH
simulations for a free-fall time scale, and analyze the resulting structure of
the collapsed cloud. We subsequently replace a density-selected subset of SPH
particles with stars by adopting a local star-formation efficiency proportional
to $\rho^{1/2}$. As a consequence, the local star formation efficiency exceeds
30 %, whereas globally only a few % of the gas is converted to stars. The
stellar distribution by the time gas is converted to stars is very clumpy, with
typically a dozen bound conglomerates that consist of 100 to $10^4$ stars. We
continue to evolve the stars dynamically using the collisional N-body method,
which accurately treats all pairwise interactions, stellar collisions and
stellar evolution. We analyze the results of the N-body simulations when the
stars have an age of 2 Myr and 10 Myr. During the dynamical simulations,
massive clusters grow via hierarchical merging of smaller clusters. The shape
of the cluster mass function that originates from an individual molecular cloud
is consistent with a Schechter function with a power-law slope of -1.73 at 2
Myr and -1.67 at 10 Myr, which fits to observed cluster mass function of the
Carina region. The superposition of mass functions have a power-law slope of <
-2, which fits the observed mass function of star clusters in the Milky Way,
M31 and M83. We further find that the mass of the most massive cluster formed
in a single molecular cloud with a mass of $M_g$ scales with $6.1M_g^{0.51}$
which also agrees with recent observation of the GMC and young clusters in M51.

about superhumps in dwarf novae. The signal of the positive superhump was only
transiently seen during the superoutburst, and it quickly decayed after the
superoutburst. The frequency variation of the negative superhump was similar to
the two previously studied dwarf novae in the Kepler field, V1504 Cyg and V344
Lyr. This is the first object in which the negative superhumps dominate
throughout the supercycle. Nevertheless, the superoutburst was faithfully
accompanied by the positive superhump, indicating that the tidal eccentric
instability is essential for triggering a superoutburst. All the pieces of
evidence strengthen the thermal-tidal instability as the origin of the
superoutburst and supercycle, making this object the third such example in the

we discussed that the object has a high mass-transfer rate close to the thermal

the dual problem and the cost function of the latter is, in fact, the
worst-case estimation error. Using geometric control theory, we construct an

problem needs to be approached first with a diagonalized form (the spectral
representation) to deal with degeneracy. Such a form is useful for this
parametrization in that the conditions to be a density matrix from a Hermitian
matrix are applied only to a diagonal eigenvalue matrix, not a unitary matrix.
Those conditions can be satisfied by parametrizing eigenvalues with squared
spherical coordinates in dimension of the matrix. Degeneracy in eigenvalues
brings symmetries between a eigenvalue matrix and a unitary matrix, which are
realized in a form of a commuting unitary matrix, called a commutant. The
associated redundant parameters in a unitary matrix have to be eliminated. It
is realized in this paper that degrees of degeneracies can be defined as the
total number of possible pairs of the same eigenvalues and one degree of
degeneracy corresponds to one phase and one two dimensional rotation in a
unitary matrix or a commutant. In this way all the degeneracies are identified
and assigned to one phase-one rotation block. Therefore, a unitary matrix or a
commutant is a product of these blocks and a general diagonal phase matrix. In
physics a unitary matrix is often parametrized by rotation and phase matrices,
called an angular representation here. There are many possible different phase
configurations. It is often not a trivial matter whether a given parametrized
unitary matrix is general. A simple diagram will be introduced to illustrate
how to transform one phase configuration to another.

that the spectral shape exhibits a double peak or a single peak depending on
the shock temperature at the shock breakout. If it is significantly smaller

display a few example of light curves, and estimate the total radiation energy.
In comparison with observations of gamma-ray bursts, a part of the higher
energy component in the spectra and the total energy can be reproduced by some

eclipsing binaries) that are observed from widely separated locations
(parallactic delay).
  Methods: A simple geometrical argument allow us to show that the apparent
timing difference depends also on the on-sky position angle of the planetary
(or secondary) orbit, relative to the ecliptic plane.
  Results: We calculate that on-sky position angle would be readily observable
using the future PLATO and CHEOPS missions data, and possibility observable
already in many known radial-velocity systems (if they exhibit transits). We
also find that on-sky coplanarity of multiple objects in the same system can be
probed more easily than the on-sky position angle of each of the objects
separately. We calculate the magnitude of the effect for all currently known
planets (should they exhibit transits), finding that almost 200 of them --
mostly radial-velocity detected planets -- have predicted timing effect larger
than 1 second. We also compute the theoretical timing precision for the PLATO
mission, that will observe a similar stellar population, and find that a 1
second effect would be frequently readily observable. We also find that on-sky
coplanarity of multiple objects in the same system can be probed more easily
than the on-sky position angle of each of the objects separately.
  Conclusions: We show a new observable from transit photometry becomes
available when very high precision transit timing is available. We find that
there is a good match between projected capabilities of the future space
missions PLATO and CHEOPS and the new observable. We give some initial science
question that such a new observable may be related to and help addressing.

in addition for each vertex v two intervals L_v and R_v called bounds. We ask
whether there exists a bounded representation in which each interval I_v has
its left endpoint in L_v and its right endpoint in R_v. We show that the
problem can be solved in linear time for interval graphs and in quadratic time
for proper interval graphs.
  Robert's Theorem states that the classes of proper interval graphs and unit
interval graphs are equal. Surprisingly the bounded representation problem is
polynomially solvable for proper interval graphs and NP-complete for unit
interval graphs [Klav\'{\i}k et al., arxiv:1207.6960]. So unless P = NP, the
proper and unit interval representations behave very differently.
  The bounded representation problem belongs to a wider class of restricted

well-understood recognition problem, and they ask whether there exists a
representation of G satisfying some additional constraints. The bounded
representation problems generalize many of these problems.

discovery of CFBDS J111807-064016, a T2 brown dwarf companion to 2MASS
J111806.99-064007.8, a low-mass M4.5-M5 star. The brown-dwarf was identified
from the Canada France Brown Dwarf Survey. At a distance of 50-120 pc, the 7.7
arcsec angular separation corresponds to projected separations of 390-900 AU.
The primary displays no Halpha emission, placing a lower limit on the age of
the system of about 6 Gyr. The kinematics is also consistent with membership in
the old thin disc. We obtained near-infrared spectra, which together with
recent atmosphere models allow us determine the effective temperature and
gravity of both components. From these parameters and the age constraint,
evolutionary models estimate masses of 0.10 to 0.15 Msol for the M dwarf, and
0.06 to 0.07 Msol for the T dwarf. This system is a particularly valuable
benchmark because the brown dwarf is an early T: the cloud-clearing that occurs
at the L/T transition is very sensitive to gravity, metallicity, and detailed
dust properties, and produces a large scatter in the colours. This T2 dwarf,
with its metallicity measured from the primary and its mass and gravity much
better constrained than those of younger early-Ts, will anchor our
understanding of the colours of L/T transition brown dwarfs. It is also one of
the most massive T dwarfs, just below the hydrogen-burning limit, and all this
makes it a prime probe a brown dwarf atmosphere and evolution models.

noncooperative, or temperature 1, model, proving it weaker than the full tile
assembly model. In the two-handed or hierarchal model, where large assemblies
can bind together on one step, we encounter an infinite set, of infinite
hierarchies, each with strictly increasing simulation power. Towards the end of
our trip, we find one tile to rule them all: a single rotatable flipable
polygonal tile that can simulate any tile assembly system. It seems this could
be the beginning of a much longer journey, so directions for future work are
suggested.

While sharing several similarities, the models have fundamental differences,
most notably the dynamic nature of CA (in which every cell location is allowed
to change state an infinite number of times) versus the static nature of the
aTAM (in which tiles are static components that can never change or be removed
once they attach to a growing assembly). We work with 2-dimensional systems in
both models, and for our results we first define what it means for CA systems
to simulate aTAM systems, and then for aTAM systems to simulate CA systems. We
use notions of simulate which are similar to those used in the study of
intrinsic universality since they are in some sense strict, but also
intuitively natural notions of simulation. We then demonstrate a particular
nondeterministic CA which can be configured so that it can simulate any
arbitrary aTAM system, and finally an aTAM tile set which can be configured so
that it can be used to simulate any arbitrary nondeterministic CA system which

finding rotation numbers of invariant curves in a two-dimensional Poincar\'{e}

an integrable system, and the rotation numbers obtained from the Birkhoff

(WEBT) in collaboration with the Steward Observatory allows us to perform a
detailed comparison with the daily gamma-ray observations by Fermi. Discrete
correlation analysis between the optical and gamma-ray emission reveals
correlation with a time lag of 0 +- 1 d, which suggests cospatiality of the
corresponding jet emitting regions. A better definition of the time lag is
hindered by the daily gaps in the sampling of the extremely fast flux
variations. In general, optical flares present more structure and develop on
longer time scales than corresponding gamma-ray flares. Observations at X-rays
and at millimetre wavelengths reveal a common trend, which suggests that the
region producing the mm and X-ray radiation is located downstream from the
optical and gamma-ray-emitting zone in the jet. The mean optical degree of
polarisation slightly decreases over the considered period and in general it is
higher when the flux is lower. The optical electric vector polarisation angle
(EVPA) shows a preferred orientation of about 15 deg, nearly aligned with the
radio core EVPA and mean jet direction. Oscillations around it increase during
the 2011-2012 outburst. We investigate the effects of a geometrical
interpretation of the long-term flux variability on the polarisation. A helical
magnetic field model predicts an evolution of the mean polarisation that is in
reasonable agreement with the observations. These can be fully explained by
introducing slight variations in the compression factor in a transverse shock
waves model.

timescale for gas accretion, (ii) the efficiency of star formation and (iii) a
threshold in the gas density for the star formation process, for each Galactic
component. We find that, in order to best fit the features of the solar
neighbourhood, the halo and thick disk must form on short timescales (~0.2 and
~1.25 Gyr, respectively), while a longer timescale is required for the
thin-disk formation. The efficiency of star formation must be maximum (10
Gyr-1) during the thick-disk phase and minimum (1 Gyr-1) during the thin-disk
formation. Also the threshold gas density for star formation is suggested to be
different in the three Galactic components. Our main conclusion is that in the
framework of our model an independent episode of accretion of extragalactic
gas, which gives rise to a burst of star formation, is fundamental to explain
the formation of the thick disk. We discuss our results in comparison to
previous studies and in the framework of modern galaxy formation theories.

processing. Dynamic nuclear polarization in semiconductors is commonly achieved
in the presence of a stabilizing external magnetic field. Here we report
efficient optical pumping of nuclear spins at zero magnetic field in strain
free GaAs quantum dots. The strong interaction of a single, optically injected
electron spin with the nuclear spins acts as a stabilizing, effective magnetic
field (Knight field) on the nuclei. We optically tune the Knight field
amplitude and direction. In combination with a small transverse magnetic field,
we are able to control the longitudinal and transverse component of the nuclear
spin polarization in the absence of lattice strain i.e. nuclear quadrupole
effects, as reproduced by our model calculations.

selection criterion including Monte Carlo simulations and derived a sample of
292 reliable cluster member galaxies for which we measured the following
properties: optical colours, stellar masses, ages, ultraviolet luminosities and
local densities. Using the MIPS 24um and Herschel data, we measured total IR
luminosities and SFR. Of the sample of 292 cluster galaxies, 38 show FIR
emission with an SFR between 0.5 and 45 Msun/yr. The spatial distribution of
the FIR emitters within the cluster density map and the filament-like
overdensities observed suggest that RXJ1257 is not virialised, but is in the
process of assembly. The average star formation as a function of the cluster
environment parametrised by the local density of galaxies does not show any
clear trend. However, the fraction of SF galaxies unveils that the cluster
intermediate-density regions is preferred for the SF activity to enhance, since
we observe a significant increase of the FIR-emitter fraction in this
environment. Focusing on the optically red SF galaxies, we can support the
interpretation of this population as dusty red galaxies, since we observe an
appreciable difference in their extinction compared with the blue population.

provide a more comprehensive description of interconnections in power systems
compared with the topological structure, which is based only on geographic
connections between network components. Motivated by these studies, in this
paper we revisit the phasor measurement unit (PMU) placement problem by
deriving the connectivity matrix of the network using resistance distances
between buses in the grid, and use it in the integer program formulations for
several standard IEEE bus systems. The main result of this paper is rather
discouraging: more number of PMUs are required, compared with those obtained
using the topological structure, to meet the desired objective of complete
network observability without zero injection measurements. However, in light of
recent advances in the electrical structure of the grid, our study provides a
more realistic perspective of PMU placement in power systems. By further
exploring the connectivity matrix derived using the electrical structure, we
devise a procedure to solve the placement problem without resorting to linear
programming.

example being the establishment of left-right asymmetry. Following the
dorsal-ventral and anterior-posterior axes, the left-right axis is the last to
be established; in several species it has been shown that an important process
involved with this is the production of a left-right asymmetric flow driven by
'whirling' cilia. It has previously been established in experimental and
mathematical models of the mouse ventral node that the combination of a
consistent rotational direction and posterior tilt creates left-right
asymmetric flow. The zebrafish organising structure, Kupffer's vesicle, has a
more complex internal arrangement of cilia than the mouse ventral node;
experimental studies show the flow exhibits an anticlockwise rotational motion
when viewing the embryo from the dorsal roof, looking in the ventral direction.
Reports of the arrangement and configuration of cilia suggest two possible
mechanisms for the generation of this flow from existing axis information: (1)
posterior tilt combined with increased cilia density on the dorsal roof, and
(2) dorsal tilt of 'equatorial' cilia. We develop a mathematical model of
symmetry breaking cilia-driven flow in Kupffer's vesicle using the regularized
Stokeslet boundary element method. Computations of the flow produced by tilted
whirling cilia in an enclosed domain suggest that a possible mechanism capable
of producing the flow field with qualitative and quantitative features closest
to those observed experimentally is a combination of posteriorly tilted roof
and floor cilia, and dorsally tilted equatorial cilia.

multiple structural breaks in the autocovariance function of a multivariate
(second- order) piecewise stationary process, which also identifies the
components of the series where the breaks occur. The new method is based on a
comparison of the estimated spectral distribution on different segments of the
observed time series and consists of three steps: it starts with a consistent
test, which allows to prove the existence of structural breaks at a controlled
type I error. Secondly, it estimates sets containing possible break points and
finally these sets are reduced to identify the relevant structural breaks and
corresponding components which are responsible for the changes in the
autocovariance structure. In contrast to all other methods which have been
proposed in the literature, our approach does not make any parametric
assumptions, is not especially designed for detecting one single change point
and addresses the problem of multiple structural breaks in the autocovariance
function directly with no use of the binary segmentation algorithm. We prove
that the new procedure detects all components and the corresponding locations
where structural breaks occur with probability converging to one as the sample
size increases and provide data-driven rules for the selection of all
regularization parameters. The results are illustrated by analyzing financial
returns, and in a simulation study it is demonstrated that the new procedure
outperforms the currently available nonparametric methods for detecting breaks

allows to perform stringent consistency tests of the Standard Model by means of
global electroweak fits, which in turn are sensitive to New Physics at scales
potentially higher than the ones explored in direct searches. From the
theoretical point of view, our limited knowledge of PDFs will be one of the
dominant sources of uncertainty in ongoing and future LHC determinations of
$M_W$. In this whitepaper, we have quantified the impact of PDF uncertainties
in the W mass extractions from the transverse mass distribution at the LHC. The
calculation has been performed using the NNPDF2.3 set, which includes direct
constrains on the W boson production kinematics with data for electroweak gauge
boson production from the LHC. Our results confirm previous estimates that PDF
uncertainties in the determination of $M_W$ from the $m_W^T$ distribution are
moderate, around 10 MeV at most. We briefly discuss also the case of the lepton

this cross-correlation is asymmetric under the exchange of the line-of-sight

bright galaxy is in front of, or behind, the faint galaxy. We give an
intuitive, quasi-Newtonian derivation of all the effects that contribute to
such an asymmetry in large-scale structure: gravitational redshift, Doppler
shift, lensing, light-cone, evolution and Alcock-Paczynski effects -
interestingly, the gravitational redshift term is exactly canceled by some of
the others, assuming geodesic motion. Most of these effects are captured by
previous calculations of general relativistic corrections to the observed
galaxy density fluctuation; the asymmetry arises from terms that are suppressed
by the ratio H/k - H is the Hubble constant and k is the wavenumber - which are
more readily observable than the terms suppressed by (H/k)^2. Some of the
contributions to the asymmetry, however, arise from terms that are generally
considered 'Newtonian' - the lensing and evolution - and thus represent a
contaminant in the search for general relativistic corrections. We propose
methods to disentangle these different contributions. A simple method reduces
the contamination to a level of < 10% for redshifts z<1. We also clarify the
relation to recent work on measuring gravitational redshifts by stacking
clusters.

partition a block of partially-received data packets in a novel way, based on

throughput-delay tradeoff becomes possible. We also propose implementations of

in-block performance adaption. Extensive simulations are then provided to
verify the performance of the proposed coding schemes and their

widest-field images of the EUV corona available from the perspective of the
Earth. By carefully processing and combining multiple SWAP images it is
possible to produce low-noise composites that reveal the structure of the EUV
corona to relatively large heights. A particularly important step in this
processing was to remove instrumental stray light from the images by
determining and deconvolving SWAP's point spread function (PSF) from the
observations. In this paper we use the resulting images to conduct the first
ever study of the evolution of the large-scale structure of the corona observed
in the EUV over a three-year period that includes the complete rise phase of
solar cycle 24. Of particular note is the persistence over many solar rotations
of bright, diffuse features composed of open magnetic field that overlie polar
crown filaments and extend to large heights above the solar surface. These
features appear to be related to coronal fans, which have previously been
observed in white-light coronagraph images and, at low heights, in the EUV. We
also discuss the evolution of the corona at different heights above the solar
surface and the evolution of the corona over the course of the solar cycle by

biological process with relevance to modern biotechnology. Here, we study
generic capsid ejection using Langevin dynamics. We show that even when the
ejection takes place within the drift-dominated region there is a very high
probability for the ejection process not to be completed. Introducing a small
aligning force at the pore entrance enhances ejection dramatically. Such a pore
asymmetry is a candidate for a mechanism by which a viral ejection is
completed. By detailed high-resolution simulations we show that such capsid
ejection is an out-of-equilibrium process that shares many common features with
the much studied driven polymer translocation through a pore in a wall or a
membrane. We find that the escape times scale with polymer length, $\tau \sim
N^\alpha$. We show that for the pore without the asymmetry the previous
predictions corroborated by Monte Carlo simulations do not hold. For the pore
with the asymmetry the scaling exponent varies with the initial monomer density
(monomers per capsid volume) $\rho$ inside the capsid. For very low densities
$\rho \le 0.002$ the polymer is only weakly confined by the capsid, and we
measure $\alpha = 1.33$, which is close to $\alpha = 1.4$ obtained for polymer
translocation. At intermediate densities the scaling exponents $\alpha = 1.25$
and $1.21$ for $\rho = 0.01$ and $0.02$, respectively. These scalings are in
accord with a crude derivation for the lower limit $\alpha = 1.2$. For the
asymmetrical pore precise scaling breaks down, when the density exceeds the
value for complete confinement by the capsid, $\rho \gtrapprox 0.25$. The
high-resolution data show that the capsid ejection for both pores, analogously
to polymer translocation, can be characterized as a multiplicative stochastic
process that is dominated by small-scale transitions.

a metal with strong spin-orbit coupling, an applied in-plane current induces
torques on the magnetization. The torques that arise from spin-orbit coupling
are of particular interest. Here, we calculate the current-induced torque in a
Pt-Co bilayer to help determine the underlying mechanism using first principles
methods. We focus exclusively on the analogue to the Rashba torque, and do not
consider the spin Hall effect. The details of the torque depend strongly on the
layer thicknesses and the interface structure, providing an explanation for the
wide variation in results found by different groups. The torque depends on the
magnetization direction in a way similar to that found for a simple Rashba
model. Artificially turning off the exchange spin splitting and separately the
spin-orbit coupling potential in the Pt shows that the primary source of the
""field-like"" torque is a proximate spin-orbit effect on the Co layer induced by
the strong spin-orbit coupling in the Pt.

radiation from small spinning dust grains. The aim of this paper is a
statistical study of the basic properties of AME regions and the environment in
which they emit. We used WMAP and Planck maps, combined with ancillary radio
and IR data, to construct a sample of 98 candidate AME sources, assembling SEDs
for each source using aperture photometry on 1deg-smoothed maps from 0.408 GHz
up to 3000 GHz. Each spectrum is fitted with a simple model of free-free,
synchrotron (where necessary), cosmic microwave background (CMB), thermal dust,
and spinning dust components. We find that 42 of the 98 sources have
significant (>5sigma) excess emission at frequencies between 20 and 60 GHz. An
analysis of the potential contribution of optically thick free-free emission
from ultra-compact HII regions, using IR colour criteria, reduces the
significant AME sample to 27 regions. The spectrum of the AME is consistent
with model spectra of spinning dust. The AME regions tend to be more spatially
extended than regions with little or no AME. The AME intensity is strongly
correlated with the submillimetre/IR flux densities and comparable to previous
AME detections in the literature. AME emissivity, defined as the ratio of AME
to dust optical depth, varies by an order of magnitude for the AME regions. The
AME regions tend to be associated with cooler dust in the range 14-20 K and an
average emissivity index of +1.8, while the non-AME regions are typically
warmer, at 20-27 K. In agreement with previous studies, the AME emissivity
appears to decrease with increasing column density. The emerging picture is
that the bulk of the AME is coming from the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
and small dust grains from the colder neutral interstellar medium phase
(Abridged).

the isolated benzene (C6H6) molecule. The quasiparticle energy levels and
especially the energies of the benzene excitons (triplet, singlet, optically
active and inactive) are in very good agreement with available experimental
results. It is shown that the vicinity of the various substrates
(pristine/doped graphene or (jellium) metal surface) reduces the quasiparticle
HOMO-LUMO gap by an amount that slightly depends on the substrate type. This is
consistent with the simple image theory predictions. It is even shown that the
substrate does not change the energy of the excitons in the isolated molecule.
We prove (in terms of simple image theory) that energies of the excitons are
indeed influenced by two mechanisms which cancel each other. We demonstrate
that the benzene singlet optically active (E1u) exciton couples to real
electronic excitations in the substrate. This causes it substantial decay, such
as {\Gamma} = 174 meV for pristine graphene and {\Gamma} = 362 meV for metal
surfaces as the substrate. However, we find that doping graphene does not
influence the E1u exciton decay rate.

goal is to put these observational features into the context of the evolution

quantify the role of massive stars for the chemical and dynamical evolution of
the ISM. Methods. Using the A-MAZE code, we perform 2d-axisymmetric
hydrodynamical simulations of the evolution of the CSM, shaped by stellar
winds, for a whole grid of massive stellar models from 15 to 120 Msun and
following the stellar evolution from the zero-age main-sequence to the time of
supernova explosion. In addition to the usual quantities, we also follow five
chemical species: H, He, C, N, and O. Results. We show how various quantities
evolve as a function of time: size of the bubble, position of the wind
termination shock, chemical composition of the bubble, etc. The chemical
composition of the bubble changes considerably compared to the initial
composition, particularly during the red-supergiant (RSG) and Wolf-Rayet (WR)
phases. In some extreme cases, the inner region of the bubble can be completely
depleted in hydrogen and nitrogen, and is mainly composed of carbon, helium and
oxygen. We argue why the bubble typically expands at a lower rate than
predicted by self-similarity theory. In particular, the size of the bubble is
very sensitive to the density of the ISM, decreasing by a factor of around 2.5
for each additional dex in ISM density. The bubble size also decreases with the
metallicity of the central star, as low-metallicity stars have weaker winds.
Our models qualitatively fit the observations of WR ejecta nebulae.

rerouted to a new location (for another service) after their service is
completed. In this work, we study mixed polling systems with rerouting. We
obtain their steady state performance by discretization using the known pseudo
conservation laws of discrete polling systems. Their stationary expected
workload is obtained as a limit of the stationary expected workload of a
discrete system. The main tools for our analysis are: a) the fixed point
analysis of infinite dimensional operators and; b) the convergence of Riemann
sums to an integral.

discuss the optimal system design. We consider a local area network, in which a
moving ferry facilitates communication (data transfer) using a wireless link.
We also consider a distributed waste collection system and derive the optimal
collection point. In both examples, the service requests can arrive anywhere in

Galaxy Survey (DGS), dedicated to the observation of the gas and dust in 48
low-metallicity environments. They were observed with PACS and SPIRE onboard
Herschel at 70,100,160,250,350, and 500 microns. We focus on a systematic
comparison of the derived FIR properties (FIR luminosity, dust mass, dust
temperature and emissivity index) with more metal-rich galaxies and investigate
the detection of a potential submm excess. The data reduction method is adapted
for each galaxy to derive the most reliable photometry from the final maps.
PACS flux densities are compared with the MIPS 70 and 160 microns bands. We use
colour-colour diagrams and modified blackbody fitting procedures to determine
the dust properties of the DGS galaxies. We also include galaxies from the
Herschel KINGFISH sample, containing more metal-rich environments, totalling
109 galaxies. The location of the DGS galaxies on Herschel colour-colour
diagrams highlights the differences in global environments of low-metallicity
galaxies. The dust in DGS galaxies is generally warmer than in KINGFISH
galaxies (T_DGS~32 K, T_KINGFISH~23 K). The emissivity index, beta, is ~1.7 in
the DGS, but metallicity does not make a strong effect on beta. The
dust-to-stellar mass ratio is lower in low-metallicity galaxies:
M_dust/M_star~0.02% for the DGS vs 0.1% for KINGFISH. Per unit dust mass, dwarf
galaxies emit ~6 times more in the FIR than higher metallicity galaxies. Out of
the 22 DGS galaxies detected at 500 micron, 41% present an excess in the submm
not explained by our dust SED model. The excess mainly appears in lower
metallicity galaxies (12+log(O/H) < 8.3), and the strongest excesses are
detected in the most metal-poor galaxies. We stress the need for observations
longwards of the Herschel wavelengths to detect any submm excess appearing
beyond 500 micron.

  Methanethiosulfonate Accessibility Experiments On Ion Channels","11 pages, includes 3 part figure",,,,"q-bio.BM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Standard models of ion channel voltage gating require substantial movement of
one transmembrane segment, S4, of the voltage sensing domain. Evidence comes
from the accessibility to external methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents of the
positively charged arginine residues (R) on this segment. These are first
mutated to cysteines (C), which in turn react with MTS reagents; it is assumed
that the C is passively carried in the S4 movement, becoming accessible on one
side or the other of the membrane. However, the Rs were salt bridged to
negatively charged residues on other transmembrane segments, or hydrogen
bonded, while C reacts as a negative ion. The space available for MTS is fairly
close to the difference in volume between the large R residue and much smaller
C, so the MTS is not severely sterically hindered. A reagent molecule can reach
a C side chain; the C can react if not repelled by a negative charge from the
amino acid to which the R had been salt bridged. Nearby protons may also make
reaction possible unless the C itself is protonated. Therefore interpretation
of the C substitution results requires reconsideration. To test the idea we
have done quantum calculations on part of a mutated S4 and the nearby section
of the channel. The mutation is R300C of the 2A79/3Lut structure, a mutation
that would be done to test MTS reagent access; there is a large cavity where
the R is replaced by C. Two quantum calculations show a substantial difference
in the structure of this cavity with 2 water molecules compared to 4. This
suggests that the structure, and presumably reaction probability, could depend
on water molecules, very likely also protons, in or near the cavity that the
R300C mutation produces.

violations of Bell's inequalities, bounds derived from the assumptions of
locality and realism, concepts integral to classical physics. Many tests of
Bell's inequalities have studied pairs of correlated particles; however, the
immense interest in multi-particle quantum correlations is driving the
experimental frontier to test systems beyond just pairs. All experimental
violations of Bell's inequalities to date require supplementary assumptions,
opening the results to one or more loopholes, the closing of which is one of
the most important challenges in quantum science. Individual loopholes have
been closed in experiments with pairs of particles and a very recent result
closed the detection loophole in a six ion experiment. No experiment thus far
has closed the locality loopholes with three or more particles. Here, we
distribute three-photon Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger entangled states using
optical fibre and free-space links to independent measurement stations. The
measured correlations constitute a test of Mermin's inequality while closing
both the locality and related freedom-of-choice loopholes due to our
experimental configuration and timing. We measured a Mermin parameter of 2.77

arXiv:1308.3762] has been used to study wave propagation in unbounded continua
with microstructure. By studying dispersion relations for the considered
relaxed medium, we are able to disclose precise frequency ranges (band-gaps)
for which propagation of waves cannot occur. These dispersion relations are
strongly nonlinear so giving rise to a macroscopic dispersive behavior of the
considered medium. We prove that the presence of band-gaps is related to a
unique elastic coefficient, the so-called Cosserat couple modulus $\mu_{c}$,
which is also responsible for the loss of symmetry of the Cauchy force stress
tensor. This parameter can be seen as the trigger of a bifurcation phenomenon
since the fact of slightly changing its value around a given threshold
drastically changes the observed response of the material with respect to wave
propagation. We finally show that band-gaps cannot be accounted for by
classical micromorphic models as well as by Cosserat and second gradient ones.
The potential fields of application of the proposed relaxed model are manifold,
above all for what concerns the conception of new engineering materials to be

nanoribbons are investigated by using the Peierls tight-binding model.
Quasi-Landau levels (QLLs), dispersionless Landau subbands within a certain
region of k-space, are resulted from the competition between magnetic and
quantum confinement effects. In bilayer system, the interlayer interactions
lead to two groups of QLLs, one occurring at the Fermi level and the other one
occurring at higher energies. Transverse electric fields are able to distort
energy spectrum, tilt two groups of QLLs and cause semiconductor-metal
transition. From the perspective of wave functions, the distribution of
electrons is explored, and the evolution of Landau states under the influence
of electric fields is clearly discussed. More interestingly, the band mixing
phenomena exhibited in the energy spectrum are related to the state mixing,
which can be apparently seen in the wave functions. The density of states,
which could be verified through surface inspections and optical experiments,
such as scanning tunneling spectroscopy and absorption spectroscopy, is
provided at last.

susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model is zero on random scale-free (SF)
networks with the small-world (SW) property. They drew the conclusion by taking
into account a long-range reinfection mechanism. In this Comment, we will show
that such an effect is too weak to guarantee an endemic phase with a {\em
finite} fraction of infected nodes. Consequently, the epidemic threshold can be
finite in random SF networks.

instantaneous frequencies and the corresponding decomposition by solving an
optimization problem. In this optimization problem, the basis to decompose the
signal is not known. Instead, it is adapted to the signal and is determined as
part of the optimization problem. In this sense, this optimization problem can
be seen as a dictionary learning problem. This dictionary learning problem is
solved by using the Augmented Lagrangian Multiplier method (ALM) iteratively.
We further accelerate the convergence of the ALM method in each iteration by
using the fast wavelet transform. We apply our method to decompose several
signals, including signals with poor scale separation, signals with outliers
and polluted by noise and a real signal. The results show that this method can
give accurate recovery of both the instantaneous frequencies and the intrinsic
mode functions.

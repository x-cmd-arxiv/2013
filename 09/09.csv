propagation with distribution at the infinite mathematical expectation of the
free path of the particle ($0<\alpha<1$). In the case $1<\alpha<2$, the

upper limits on gamma-ray fluxes of currently known radio pulsars and using the

beams that intersect our line of sight. By modeling the misalignment of radio
and gamma-ray beams of these pulsars, we find an average gamma-ray beaming
solid angle of about 3.7{\pi} for the OG model, assuming a uniform beam. Using

strength of the pulsar population of 3.8 and 3.2 X 10^{10} G, respectively. We
then predict the number of non-recycled pulsars detectable by the LAT based on
our population model. Using the two-year sensitivity, we find that the LAT is
capable of detecting emission from about 380 non-recycled pulsars, including
150 currently identified radio pulsars. Using the expected five-year
sensitivity, about 620 non-recycled pulsars are detectable, including about 220

previous optimisation strategies and analyse data read/write times for
different memory types. In LBM, the time propagation step (known as streaming),
involves shifting data to adjacent locations and is central to parallel
performance; here we examine three approaches which make use of different
hardware options. Two of which make use of `performance enhancing' features of
the GPU; shared memory and the new shuffle instruction found in Kepler based
GPUs. These are compared to a standard transfer of data which relies instead on
optimised storage to increase coalesced access. It is shown that the more
simple approach is most efficient; since the need for large numbers of
registers per thread in LBM limits the block size and thus the efficiency of
these special features is reduced. Detailed results are obtained for a D3Q19

case the use of a read-only data cache is explored, and peak performance of
over 1036 Million Lattice Updates Per Second (MLUPS) is achieved. The
appearance of a periodic bottleneck in the solver performance is also reported,
believed to be hardware related; spikes in iteration-time occur with a

molecules, have been recently ascribed to mixed aromatic/aliphatic organic
nanoparticles. More recently, an upper limit of <9% on the aliphatic fraction
(i.e., the fraction of carbon atoms in aliphatic form) of the UIE carriers
based on the observed intensities of the 3.4 and 3.3 micrometer emission
features by attributing them to aliphatic and aromatic C-H stretching modes,
respectively, and assuming A_34./A_3.3~0.68 derived from a small set of
aliphatic and aromatic compounds, where A_3.4 and A_3.3 are respectively the
band strengths of the 3.4 micrometer aliphatic and 3.3 micrometer aromatic C-H
bonds.
  To improve the estimate of the aliphatic fraction of the UIE carriers, here
we analyze 35 UIE sources which exhibit both the 3.3 and 3.4 micrometer C-H
features and determine I_3.4/I_3.3, the ratio of the power emitted from the 3.4
micrometer feature to that from the 3.3 micrometer feature. We derive the
median ratio to be <I_3.4/I_3.3> ~ 0.12. We employ density functional theory
and second-order perturbation theory to compute A_3.4/A_3.3 for a range of
methyl-substituted PAHs. The resulting A_3.4/A_3.3 ratio well exceeds 1.4, with
an average ratio of <A_3.4/A_3.3> ~1.76. By attributing the 3.4 micrometer
feature exclusively to aliphatic C-H stretch (i.e., neglecting anharmonicity
and superhydrogenation), we derive the fraction of C atoms in aliphatic form to
be ~2%. We therefore conclude that the UIE emitters are predominantly aromatic.

dozen Galactic and Magellanic Cloud carbon-rich post-asymptotic giant branch
(post-AGB) stars. The nature of its carrier remains unknown since the first
detection of the 21 micrometer feature in 1989. Over a dozen materials have
been suggested as possible carrier candidates. However, none of them has been
accepted: they either require too much material (compared to what is available
in the circumstellar shells around these post-AGB stars), or exhibit additional
emission features which are not seen in these 21 micrometer sources.
  Recently, iron monoxide (FeO) nanoparticles seem to be a promising carrier
candidate as Fe is an abundant element and FeO emits exclusively at ~21
micrometer. In this work, using the proto-typical protoplanetary nebula HD
56126 as a test case, we examine FeO nanoparticles as a carrier for the 21
micrometer feature by modeling their infrared emission, with FeO being
stochastically heated by single stellar photons. We find that FeO emits too
broad a 21 micrometer feature to explain the observed one and the Fe abundance
required to be locked up in FeO exceeds what is available in HD 56126. We
therefore conclude that FeO nanoparticles are unlikely responsible for the 21

correctly determining of the planetary parameters. For stars hosting a
transiting planet, determining of the planetary mass and radius depends on the
stellar mass and radius, which in turn depend on the atmospheric stellar
parameters. Different methods can provide different results, which leads to
different planet characteristics.}%Spectroscopic surface gravities have shown
to be poorly constrained, but the photometry of the transiting planet can
provide an independent measurement of the surface gravity.
  Aims. In this paper, we use a uniform method to spectroscopically derive
stellar atmospheric parameters, chemical abundances, stellar masses, and
stellar radii for a sample of 90 transit hosts. Surface gravities are also
derived photometrically using the stellar density as derived from the light
curve. We study the effect of using these different surface gravities on the
determination of the chemical abundances and the stellar mass and radius.
  Methods. A spectroscopic analysis based on Kurucz models in LTE was performed
through the MOOG code to derive the atmospheric parameters and the chemical
abundances. The photometric surface gravity was determined through isochrone
fitting and the use of the stellar density, directly determined from the light
curve. Stellar masses and radii are determined through calibration formulae.
  Results. Spectroscopic and photometric surface gravities differ, but this has
very little effect on the precise determination of the stellar mass in our
spectroscopic analysis. The stellar radius, and hence the planetary radius, is
most affected by the surface gravity discrepancies. For the chemical
abundances, the difference is, as expected, only noticable for the abundances
derived from analyzing of lines of ionized species.

estimation errors are confined into prescribed polyhedral sets and converge to
zero in absence of disturbances. Quite remarkably, the design of an LSE is
recast into an optimization problem that requires data from the corresponding
subsystem and its parents only. This allows one to synthesize LSEs in a
Plug-and-Play (PnP) fashion, i.e. when a subsystem gets added, the update of
the whole estimator requires at most the design of an LSE for the subsystem and

Two networks with real-valued edge labels are temporally isomorphic if there

which sequential edge labels are strictly increasing. An equivalence class of
temporally ismorphic networks is known as an isotemporal class. Methods to
determine the number of isotemporal classes of a particular graph structure
N(G) are non-obvious, and refractory to traditional techniques such as P\'olya
enumeration (P\'olya, 1937). Here, I present a simple formula for the number of

characterization of conics (""every set of $q+1$ points in $\mathrm{PG}(2,q)$,

proving a beautiful and interesting theorem; he in fact provided the starting

eigenvalues of the bipartite mixed states {\rho} with the property that
U^*{\rho}U is separable for all unitary matrices U. This problem has been
solved when the local dimensions m and n satisfy m = 2 and n <= 3. We solve all

of these cases we show that a state is separable from spectrum if and only if
U^*{\rho}U has positive partial transpose for all unitary matrices U. This
equivalence is in stark contrast with the usual separability problem, where a

concept in quantum mechanics - stems from the choice of the measurement
apparatus. The notion of complementarity is closely related to Heisenberg's
uncertainty principle, but the exact relation between the two remains a source
of debate. For example, knowledge of a particle's position in a double slit
interference experiment will quench its wave-like nature and, vice versa,
observing the wave property via interference implies lack of knowledge of the
particle's path. A canonical system for exploring complementarity is the
quantum eraser (QE), predominantly studied thus far in photonic systems. A QE
is an interference experiment consisting of two stages. First, one of the
interfering paths is coupled to a 'which path' (WP) detector - demonstrating
loss of interference due to acquisition of WP information. Second, the WP
information is being 'erased' by projecting the detector's wavefunction on a
particular basis; this renders the WP information inaccessible, thus allowing
reconstruction of the interference pattern. In this work, we present a first
implementation of a QE in an electronic system. Our system consists of two
identical electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) entangled via Coulomb
interactions. Such novel setup has already attracted a considerable theoretical
attention. With one MZI serving as a path detector and the other as the system
interferometer, the visibility of the Aharonov-Bohm oscillation in the System
can be controlled by the Detector. We demonstrate how a continuous change of
the measurement basis, followed by post selection (via cross correlation of
current fluctuations), allows a smooth transition between keeping and erasing
the WP information.

allows mapping thermal transport and temperatures in nanoscale devices, is
becoming a key approach that may help to resolve heat dissipation problems in
modern processors and develop new thermoelectric materials. Unfortunately,
performance of current SThM implementations in measurement of high thermal
conductivity materials continues to me limited. The reason for these
limitations is two-fold - first, SThM measurements of high thermal conductivity
materials need adequate high thermal conductivity of the probe apex, and
secondly, the quality of thermal contact between the probe and the sample
becomes strongly affected by the nanoscale surface corrugations of the studied
sample. In this paper we develop analytical models of the SThM approach that
can tackle these complex problems - by exploring high thermal conductivity
nanowires as a tip apex, and exploring contact resistance between the SThM
probe and studied surface, the latter becoming particularly important when both
tip and surface have high thermal conductivities. We develop analytical model
supported by the finite element analysis simulations and by the experimental
tests of SThM prototype using carbon nanotube (CNT) at the tip apex as a heat
conducting nanowire. These results elucidate vital relationships between the
performance of the probe in SThM from one side and thermal conductivity,
geometry of the probe and its components from the other, providing pathway for
overcoming current limitations of SThM.

hyperbolicity guarantees well-posedness of the initial value problem. Symmetric
hyperbolic systems are shown to render the initial boundary value problem
well-posed with maximally dissipative boundary conditions. I discuss the
Laplace-Fourier method for analyzing the initial boundary value problem.
Finally I state how these notions extend to systems that are first order in
time and second order in space. In the second lecture I discuss the effect that
the gauge freedom of electromagnetism has on the PDE status of the initial
value problem. I focus on gauge choices, strong-hyperbolicity and the
construction of constraint preserving boundary conditions. I show that strongly
hyperbolic pure gauges can be used to build strongly hyperbolic formulations. I
examine which of these formulations is additionally symmetric hyperbolic and
finally demonstrate that the system can be made boundary stable.

overcharged by a test particle but an extremal Reissner-Nordstr\""om de Sitter
(RN-dS) black hole cannot be overcharged. We also show that both extrmal
Kerr-de-Sitter (Kerr-dS) and Kerr-anti-de-Sitter (Kerr-AdS) black holes can be
overspun by a test particle, implying a possible breakdown of the cosmic
censorship conjecture. For the Kerr-AdS case, the overspinning requires that
the energy of the particle be negative, a reminiscent of the Penrose process.
In contrast to the extremal RN and Kerr black holes, in which cases the cosmic
censorship is upheld, our results suggest some subtle relations between the
cosmological constants and the comic censorship. We also discuss the effect of
radiation reaction for the Kerr-dS case and find that the magnitude of energy
loss due to gravitational radiation may not be enough to prevent the violation
of the cosmic censorship.

also turns out to enhance the degree of multipartite nonlocality in a broad

a fundamental problem in the biology of apoptosis and has implications for

Our results show that the type 1/type 2 choice is linked to deterministic

control of the apoptotic pathways. Consistent with previous findings, our
results indicate that caspase 8 activation level is a key regulator of the
choice between deterministic type 1 and stochastic type 2 pathways,

also regulate the type 1/type 2 choice. A simplified model of DISC clustering
elucidates the mechanism of increased active caspase 8 generation, and type 1

approximated in a suitable sense by finite symmetric groups and groups of
unitary matrices. These notions turned out to be very deep and fruitful, and
stimulated in the last 15 years an impressive amount of research touching
several seemingly distant areas of mathematics including geometric group
theory, operator algebras, dynamical systems, graph theory, and more recently
even quantum information theory. Several longstanding conjectures that are
still open for arbitrary groups were settled in the case of sofic or
hyperlinear groups. These achievements aroused the interest of an increasing
number of researchers into some fundamental questions about the nature of these
approximation properties. Many of such problems are to this day still open such
as, outstandingly: Is there any countable discrete group that is not sofic or
hyperlinear? A similar pattern can be found in the study of II_1 factors. In
this case the famous conjecture due to Connes (commonly known as the Connes
embedding conjecture) that any II_1 factor can be approximated in a suitable
sense by matrix algebras inspired several breakthroughs in the understanding of
II_1 factors, and stands out today as one of the major open problems in the
field. The aim of these notes is to present in a uniform and accessible way
some cornerstone results in the study of sofic and hyperlinear groups and the
Connes embedding conjecture. The presentation is nonetheless self contained and
accessible to any student or researcher with a graduate level mathematical
background. An appendix by V. Pestov provides a pedagogically new introduction

collisionless gas from a geometric perspective. We start by reviewing the rich
geometrical structure of the tangent bundle TM of a given spacetime manifold,
including the splitting of the tangent spaces of TM into horizontal and
vertical subspaces and the natural metric and symplectic structure it induces
on TM. Based on these structures we introduce the Liouville vector field L and
a suitable Hamiltonian function H on TM. The Liouville vector field turns out
to be the Hamiltonian vector field associated to H. On the other hand, H also
defines the mass shells as Lorentzian submanifolds of the tangent bundle. A
simple collisionless gas is described by a distribution function on a
particular mass shell, satisfying the Liouville equation. Together with the
Liouville vector field the distribution function can be thought of as defining
a fictitious incompressible fluid on the mass shells, with associated conserved
current density. Flux integrals of this current density provide the averaged
properties of the gas, while suitable fibre integrals of the distribution
function define divergence-free tensor fields on the spacetime manifold such as
the current density and stress-energy tensor. Finally, we discuss the
relationship between symmetries of the spacetime manifold and symmetries of the
distribution function.
  As a first application of our formalism we derive the most general
spherically symmetric distribution function on any spherically symmetric
spacetime and write the Einstein-Liouville equations as effective field
equations on the two-dimensional radial manifold. As a second application we
derive the most general collisionless distribution function on a Kerr black
hole spacetime background.

of dc-magnetization, ac-susceptibility, specific heat, and electrical
resistivity measurements. The dc-magnetization and ac-susceptibility
measurements have revealed that the transition temperature and the ordered
moment of the ferromagnetic order are strongly suppressed as La is substituted
for Sr. The ac-susceptibility exhibits a peak at T* due to the occurrence of
spontaneous spin polarization. Furthermore, we observed that T* shows clear
frequency variations for x>= 0.3. The magnitude of the frequency shifts of T*
is comparable to that of cluster-glass systems, and the frequency dependence is
well described in terms of the Vogel-Fulcher law. On the other hand, it is
found that the linear specific heat coefficient gamma enhances with the
suppression of the ferromagnetic order. The relatively large gamma values
reflect the presence of the Ru 4d state at Fermi level, and hence, the
magnetism of this system is considered to be tightly coupled with the itinerant
characteristics of the Ru 4d electrons. The present experimental results and
analyses suggest that the intrinsic coexistence of the spatially inhomogeneous
magnetic state and the itinerant nature of the Ru 4d electrons is realized in
this system, and such a feature may be commonly involved in La- and Ca-doped
SrRuO3.

This problem, which we call maximum submodular-function matching (MSM), is a
natural generalization of maximum weight matching (MWM), which is in turn a
generalization of maximum cardinality matching (MCM). We give two incomparable
algorithms for this problem with space usage falling in the semi-streaming

achieve approximation ratios of $7.75$ in a single pass and $(3+\epsilon)$ in

mimic those of Zelke's and McGregor's respective algorithms for MWM; the
novelty lies in the analysis for the MSM setting. In fact we identify a general
framework for MWM algorithms that allows this kind of adaptation to the broader

solar energetic particles to very high energies. Acceleration efficiency is
increased by entrapment through self-generated waves, which is highly dependent
on the amount of accelerated particles. This, in turn, is determined by the
efficiency of particle injection into the acceleration process.
  Aims: We present an analysis of the injection efficiency at coronal shocks of
varying obliquity. We assessed injection through reflection and downstream
scattering, including the effect of a cross-shock potential. Both quasi-thermal
and suprathermal seed populations were analysed. We present results on the
effect of cross-field diffusion downstream of the shock on the injection
efficiency.
  Methods: Using analytical methods, we present applicable injection speed
thresholds that were compared with both semi-analytical flux integration and
Monte Carlo simulations, which do not resort to binary thresholds. Shock-normal
angle and shock-normal velocity were varied to assess the injection efficiency
with respect to these parameters.
  Results: We present evidence of a significant bias of thermal seed particle
injection at small shock-normal angles. We show that downstream isotropisation
methods affect the theta-dependence of this result. We show a non-negligible
effect caused by the cross-shock potential, and that the effect of downstream
cross-field diffusion is highly dependent on boundary definitions.
  Conclusions: Our results show that for Monte Carlo simulations of coronal
shock acceleration a full distribution function assessment with downstream
isotropisation through scatterings is necessary to realistically model particle
injection. Based on our results, seed particle injection at quasi-parallel
coronal shocks can result in significant acceleration efficiency, especially
when combined with varying field-line geometry.

onset of the afterglow in their optical light curves. We find that Gamma_0 is
strongly correlated with both the isotropic equivalent luminosity L_iso and
energy E_iso and, with a larger scatter, also with the rest frame peak energy
E_peak. These new correlations allow us to interpret the spectral energy
correlations E_peak-L_iso (-E_iso) as a sequence of Gamma_0 factors. By
accounting for the beaming effects, we find that the comoving frame properties
of GRBs result clustered around typical values (e.g. L'_iso~5x10^48 erg/s).
Moreover, it is theoretically predicted that there should be a link between the
jet dynamics (Gamma_0) and its geometry (theta_jet). Through a population
synthesis code we reconstruct the Gamma_0 and theta_jet distributions and
search for a possible link between them. We find that Gamma_0 and theta_jet in
GRBs should have log-normal distributions and they should be anti correlated
(i.e. theta_jet^2*Gamma_0=const).

  arXiv:1308.0275",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A low-rank transformation learning framework for subspace clustering and
classification is here proposed. Many high-dimensional data, such as face
images and motion sequences, approximately lie in a union of low-dimensional
subspaces. The corresponding subspace clustering problem has been extensively
studied in the literature to partition such high-dimensional data into clusters
corresponding to their underlying low-dimensional subspaces. However,
low-dimensional intrinsic structures are often violated for real-world
observations, as they can be corrupted by errors or deviate from ideal models.
We propose to address this by learning a linear transformation on subspaces
using matrix rank, via its convex surrogate nuclear norm, as the optimization
criteria. The learned linear transformation restores a low-rank structure for
data from the same subspace, and, at the same time, forces a a maximally
separated structure for data from different subspaces. In this way, we reduce
variations within subspaces, and increase separation between subspaces for a
more robust subspace clustering. This proposed learned robust subspace
clustering framework significantly enhances the performance of existing
subspace clustering methods. Basic theoretical results here presented help to
further support the underlying framework. To exploit the low-rank structures of
the transformed subspaces, we further introduce a fast subspace clustering
technique, which efficiently combines robust PCA with sparse modeling. When
class labels are present at the training stage, we show this low-rank
transformation framework also significantly enhances classification
performance. Extensive experiments using public datasets are presented, showing
that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
for subspace clustering and classification.

using CAD drawings to generate robot programs off-line. Sensory feedback allows
minimization of the effects of uncertainty, providing information to adjust the
robot paths during robot operation.
  Findings - It was found that it is possible to generate a robot program from
a common CAD drawing and run it without any major concerns about calibration or
CAD model accuracy.
  Research limitations/implications - A limitation of the proposed system has
to do with the fact that it was designed to be used for particular

artificial vision and laser scanning to identify and characterize different
workpieces travelling on a conveyor. Using laser triangulation, the workpieces
are virtually reconstructed through a simplified cloud of three-dimensional
(3D) points. From those reconstructed models, several algorithms are
implemented to extract information about workpieces profile (pattern
recognition), size, boundary and pose. Such information is then used to on-line
adjust the base robot programmes. These robot programmes are off-line generated
from a 3D computer-aided design model of each different workpiece profile.
Finally, the robotic manipulator executes the coating process after its base
programmes have been adjusted. This is a low-cost and fully autonomous system
that allows adapting the robots behaviour to different manufacturing
situations. It means that the robot is ready to work over any piece at any
time, and thus, small production series can be reduced to as much as a
one-object series. No skilled workers and large setup times are needed to
operate it. Experimental results showed that this solution proved to be
efficient and can be applied not only for spray coating purposes but also for
many other industrial processes (automatic manipulation, pick-and-place,
inspection, etc.).

the interesting feature that the main Klein-Nishina line is accompanied by a
series of side-lines forming a broad plateau where up to ${\cal O} (10^3)$
laser photons participate simultaneously in a single scattering event. An
analytic formula for the width of the plateau is given. Due to the non-linear
mixing of X-ray and laser photons a frequency dependent rotation of the
polarization of the final state X-ray photons relative to the scattering plane
emerges. A consistent description of the scattering process with short laser
pulses requires to work with X-ray pulses. An experimental investigation can be
accomplished, e.g., at LCLS or the European XFEL in the near future.

  recognition","Industrial Robot: An International Journal","Industrial Robot: An International Journal, Vol. 37 Iss: 2, 2010,
  pp.137 - 147","10.1108/01439911011018911",,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose - Most industrial robots are still programmed using the typical
teaching process, through the use of the robot teach pendant. This is a tedious
and time-consuming task that requires some technical expertise, and hence new
approaches to robot programming are required. The purpose of this paper is to
present a robotic system that allows users to instruct and program a robot with
a high-level of abstraction from the robot language.
  Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents in detail a robotic system
that allows users, especially non-expert programmers, to instruct and program a
robot just showing it what it should do, in an intuitive way. This is done
using the two most natural human interfaces (gestures and speech), a force
control system and several code generation techniques. Special attention will
be given to the recognition of gestures, where the data extracted from a motion
sensor (three-axis accelerometer) embedded in the Wii remote controller was
used to capture human hand behaviours. Gestures (dynamic hand positions) as
well as manual postures (static hand positions) are recognized using a
statistical approach and artificial neural networks.
  Practical implications - The key contribution of this paper is that it offers
a practical method to program robots by means of gestures and speech, improving
work efficiency and saving time.
  Originality/value - This paper presents an alternative to the typical robot
teaching process, extending the concept of human-robot interaction and
co-worker scenario. Since most companies do not have engineering resources to
make changes or add new functionalities to their robotic manufacturing systems,
this system constitutes a major advantage for small- to medium-sized
enterprises.

wind clumping and porosity vary with velocity. We aim to demonstrate
empirically that while at most wind velocities optically thick clumps cover
only a fraction of the stellar surface, close to the terminal velocity where
narrow absorption components (NACs) appear in UV lines the covering factor is
approximately unity. SEI line-synthesis models are used to determine the radial
optical depths of blue and red components of the SiIV 1400 resonance line
doublet in a sample of 12 B0 to B4 supergiants. We focus on stars with well
developed NACs and relatively low terminal velocity so that the SiIV doublet
components can be treated as radiatively decoupled and formed independently.
For all 12 stars the mean optical depth ratio of the blue to red components is
closer to ~ 2 (i.e. the ratio of oscillator strengths) in the NACs than at
intermediate and lower velocities. The product of mass-loss rate and Si^3+ ion
fraction calculated from the NAC optical depths is a factor of ~ 2 to 9 higher
compared to mass-loss values sampled at ~ 0.4 to 0.6 of the terminal velocity.
Since the wind effectively becomes `smooth' at the high NAC velocities and the
column density is uniformly distributed over the stellar disk, the optical
depths of the NACs are not seriously affected by porosity and this feature thus
provides the most reliable measurement of mass-loss rate in the UV lines.
Applications of this result to the weak-wind problem of late O-dwarf stars and
the ""PV mass loss discordance"" in early O supergiants are discussed.

Hadron Collider is a Technicolor (TC) isosinglet scalar, the TC Higgs. By
comparison with quantum chromodynamics, we argue that the couplings of the TC
Higgs to the massive weak bosons are very close to the Standard Model (SM)
values. The couplings to photons and gluons are model-dependent, but close to
the SM values in several TC theories. The couplings of the TC Higgs to SM
fermions are due to interactions beyond TC, such as Extended Technicolor: if
such interactions successfully generate mass for the SM fermions, we argue that
the couplings of the latter to the TC Higgs are also SM-like.
  We suggest a generic parameterization of the TC Higgs interactions with SM
particles that accommodates a large class of TC models, and we perform a fit of
these parameters to the Higgs LHC data. The fit reveals regions of parameter
space where the form factors are of order unity and consistent with data at the
95% CL, in agreement with expectations in TC theories. This indicates that the
discovered Higgs boson is consistent with the TC Higgs hypothesis for several
TC theories.

point where it turns to zero. This equation describes the dynamics of the
magnetic---$m$, as well as the superconducting order parameter---$\Delta$. It
is valid at low temperatures $T$ and small $m$ (${T, m \ll \Delta}$) in a
region of coexistence of both order parameters, $m$ and $\Delta$. The boundary
of this region is found in the space of the nesting parameter
$\{\mu_{0},\mu_{\phi}\}$ where $\mu_{0}$ describes the relative position of the
electron and the hole pockets on the energy scale, and $\mu_{\phi}$ accounts
for the ellipticity of the electron pocket. At low $T$ the number of
quasiparticles is small due to the presence of the energy gap $\Delta$, and
therefore the quasiparticles do not play a role in the relaxation of $m$. This
circumstance allows one to derive the time-dependent equation for $m$ in
contrast to the case of conventional superconductors for which the
time-dependent Ginzburg--Landau equation can be derived near $T_{\text{c}}$
only in some special cases (high concentration of paramagnetic impurities. In
the stationary case the derived equation is valid at arbitrary temperatures. We
find a solution of the stationary equation which describes a domain wall in the
magnetic structure. In the center of the domain wall the superconducting order
parameter has a maximum, which means a local enhancement of superconductivity.
Using the derived time-dependent equation for $m$, we investgate also the
stability of a uniform commensurate SDW and obtain the values of $\{\mu_{0},
\mu_{\phi}\}$ at which the first order transition into the state with ${m = 0}$
takes place or the transition to the state with an inhomogeneous SDW occurs.

axions and photons of one order of magnitude beyond the limits of the current
detector, the CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST). The IAXO detector relies on a
high-magnetic field distributed over a very large volume to convert solar
axions to detectable X-ray photons. Inspired by the ATLAS barrel and end-cap
toroids, a large superconducting toroid is being designed. The toroid comprises
eight, one meter wide and twenty one meters long racetrack coils. The assembled
toroid is sized 5.2 m in diameter and 25 m in length and its mass is about 250
tons. The useful field in the bores is 2.5 T while the peak magnetic field in
the windings is 5.4 T. At the operational current of 12 kA the stored energy is
500 MJ. The racetrack type of coils are wound with a reinforced Aluminum
stabilized NbTi/Cu cable and are conduction cooled. The coils optimization is
shortly described as well as new concepts for cryostat, cold mass, supporting
structure and the sun tracking system. Materials selection and sizing,
conductor, thermal loads, the cryogenics system and the electrical system are
described. Lastly, quench simulations are reported to demonstrate the system's

interfaces between insulating complex oxides provides the opportunity for a new
generation of all-oxide electronics. Particularly, the 2DEG at the interface
between two perovskite insulators represented by the formula of ABO3, such as
LaAlO3 and SrTiO3, has attracted significant attention. In recent years,
progresses have been made to decipher the puzzle of the origin of interface
conduction, to design new types of oxide interfaces, and to improve the
interfacial carrier mobility significantly. These achievements open the door to
explore fundamental as well as applied physics of complex oxides. Here, we
review our recent experimental work on metallic and insulating interfaces
controlled by interfacial redox reactions in SrTiO3-based heterostructures. Due
to the presence of oxygen-vacancies at the SrTiO3 surface, metallic conduction
can be created at room temperature in perovskite-type interfaces when the
overlayer oxide ABO3 involves Al, Ti, Zr, or Hf elements at the B-sites.
Furthermore, relying on interface-stabilized oxygen vacancies, we have created
a new type of 2DEG at the heterointerface between SrTiO3 and a spinel
{\gamma}-Al2O3 epitaxial film with compatible oxygen ions sublattices. The
spinel/perovskite oxide 2DEG exhibits an electron mobility exceeding 100,000
cm2V-1s-1, more than one order of magnitude higher than those of hitherto
investigated perovskite-type interfaces. Our findings pave the way for design
of high-mobility all-oxide electronic devices and open a route towards studies
of mesoscopic physics with complex oxides.

largest global firms follow a Pareto distribution in an intermediate range,
that is ``interrupted'' by a sharp cut-off in its upper tail, where it is
totally dominated by financial firms. This flattening of the distribution
contrasts with a large body of empirical literature which finds a Pareto
distribution for firm sizes both across countries and over time. Pareto
distributions are generally traced back to a mechanism of proportional random
growth, based on a regime of constant returns to scale. This makes our findings
of an ``interrupted'' Pareto distribution all the more puzzling, because we
provide evidence that financial firms in our sample should operate in such a
regime. We claim that the missing mass from the upper tail of the asset size
distribution is a consequence of shadow banking activity and that it provides
an (upper) estimate of the size of the shadow banking system. This estimate --
which we propose as a shadow banking index -- compares well with estimates of
the Financial Stability Board until 2009, but it shows a sharper rise in shadow
banking activity after 2010. Finally, we propose a proportional random growth
model that reproduces the observed distribution, thereby providing a
quantitative estimate of the intensity of shadow banking activity.

profile of the lines to address the emitting region of the transitions and
directly probe the distribution of warm gas in the disk. The spectra reveal
double-peaked CO line profiles centered on the systemic velocity, consistent
with a disk origin. The J=16-15 line profile is broader than that of the J=10-9
line, which in turn is broader than those of lower J transitions (6-5, 3-2,
observed with APEX), thus showing a clear temperature gradient of the gas with
radius. A power-law flat disk model is used to fit the CO line profiles and the
CO rotational ladder simultaneously, yielding a temperature of T_0=1100 \pm 350
K (at r_0 = 13 AU) and an index of q=0.85 \pm 0.1 for the temperature radial
gradient. This indicates that the gas has a steeper radial temperature gradient
than the dust (mean q_{dust} ~ 0.5), providing further proof of the thermal
decoupling of gas and dust at the disk heights where the CO lines form. The
[CII] line profile shows a strong single-peaked profile red-shifted by 0.5 km
s-1 compared to the systemic velocity. We conclude that the bulk of the [CII]

order (NLO) is given for e^+ e^- scattering. A model with broken SU(3) symmetry
uses three input fragmentation functions \alpha(x, Q^2), \beta(x,Q^2) and
\gamma(x,Q^2) and a strangeness suppression parameter \lambda to describe all
the light quark fragmentation functions for the entire vector meson octet. At a
starting low energy scale of Q_0^2 = 1.5 GeV^2 for three light quarks (u, d, s)
along with initial parameterization, the fragmentation functions are evolved
through DGLAP evolution equations at NLO and the cross-section is calculated.
The heavy quarks contribution are added in appropriate thresholds during
evolution. The results obtained are fitted at the momentum scale of \sqrt{s}=
91.2 GeV for LEP and SLD data. Good-quality fits are obtained for \rho, K^*,
\omega and \phi mesons, implying the consistency and efficiency of this model
that explains the fragmentation functions of vector mesons both at the leading
and the next to leading order in QCD. Keywords: vector meson, fragmentation,
SU(3) symmetry, NLO .

distribution of unknown parameters, as suggested recently by Efron (2013). It
is applied to estimating the empirical distribution of the 'sampling
probabilities' of m sampled items. The estimated empirical distribution is used
to modify the Horvitz-Thompson estimator. The performance of the modified
Horvitz-Thompson estimator is studied in two examples. In one example the
sampling probabilities are estimated based on the number of visits until a
response was obtained. The other example is based on real data from panel
sampling, where in four consecutive months there are corresponding four
attempts to interview each member in a panel. The sampling probabilities are
estimated based on the number of successful attempts.
  We also discuss briefly, further applications of deconvolution, including
estimation of False discovery rate.

Q[X_1,\ldots,X_n]$ restricted to the vanishing locus $V\subset\mathbb R^n$ of
polynomials $f_1,\ldots, f_p\in\mathbb Q[X_1,\ldots, X_n]$ is of first
importance in several applications in optimization and in real algebraic
geometry. These points are solutions of a highly structured system of
multivariate polynomial equations involving maximal minors of a Jacobian
matrix. We investigate the complexity of solving this problem by using
Gr\""obner basis algorithms under genericity assumptions on the coefficients of
the input polynomials. The main results refine known complexity bounds (which
depend on the maximum $D=\max(deg(f_1),\ldots,deg(f_p),deg(q))$) to bounds
which depend on the list of degrees $(deg(f_1),\ldots,deg(f_p),deg(q))$: we
prove that the Gr\""obner basis computation can be performed in
$\delta^{O(\log(A)/\log(G))}$ arithmetic operations in $\mathbb Q$, where
$\delta$ is the algebraic degree of the ideal vanishing on the critical points,
and $A$ and $G$ are the arithmetic and geometric average of a multiset
constructed from the sequence of degrees. As a by-product, we prove that
solving such generic optimization problems with Gr\""obner bases requires at
most $D^{O(n)}$ arithmetic operations in $\mathbb Q$, which meets the best
known complexity bound for this problem. Finally, we illustrate these
complexity results with experiments, giving evidence that these bounds are
relevant for applications.

$T_{\mathrm{C}}\approx 170$ K and the transition at $T_{\mathrm{OO}}\approx 10$
K, which has been associated with orbital ordering, are only weakly shifted in
magnetic fields up to 9 T. The cubic lattice parameter is found to decrease
when entering the state below $T_{\mathrm{OO}}$. The magnetic moments of the
Cr- and Fe-ions are reduced from the spin-only values throughout the
magnetically ordered regime, but approach the spin-only values for fields
$>$5.5 T. Thermal expansion in magnetic fields and magnetostriction experiments
indicate a contraction of the sample below about 60 K. Below $T_{\mathrm{OO}}$
this contraction is followed by a moderate expansion of the sample for fields
larger than $\sim$4.5 T. The transition at $T_{\mathrm{OO}}$ is accompanied by
an anomaly in the dielectric constant. The dielectric constant depends on both
the strength and orientation of the external magnetic field with respect to the
applied electric field for $T<T_{\mathrm{OO}}$. A linear correlation of the
magnetic-field-induced change of the dielectric constant and the magnetic-field

existence of a ferroelectric polarization and a multiferroic ground state below
10 K.

revealed. Furthermore, we propose two suboptimal power allocation schemes based
on the upper bound solution. Simulation results demonstrate the excellent
performance and significant transmit power savings achieved by the proposed
schemes compared to isotropic energy signal generation.

planar arrays of randomly actuated synthetic jets. This arrangement creates
turbulence at high Reynolds number with low mean flow. Most importantly, it
exhibits a region of 3D homogeneous isotropic turbulence that is significantly
larger than the integral lengthscale. These features are essential for enabling
laboratory measurements of turbulent suspensions. We use quantitative imaging
to confirm isotropy at large, small, and intermediate scales by examining one--
and two--point statistics at the tank center. We then repeat these same
measurements to confirm that the values measured at the tank center are
constant over a large homogeneous region. In the direction normal to the
symmetry plane, our measurements demonstrate that the homogeneous region
extends for at least twice the integral length scale $L=9.5$ cm. In the
directions parallel to the symmetry plane, the region is at least four times
the integral lengthscale, and the extent in this direction is limited only by
the size of the tank. Within the homogeneous isotropic region, we measure a
turbulent kinetic energy of $6.07 \times 10^{-4} $m$^2$s$^{-2}$, a dissipation
rate of $4.65 \times 10^{-5} $m$^2$s$^{-3}$, and a Taylor--scale Reynolds
number of $R_\lambda=334$. The tank's large homogeneous region, combined with
its high Reynolds number and its very low mean flow, provides the best
approximation of homogeneous isotropic turbulence realized in a laboratory flow
to date. These characteristics make the stirred tank an optimal facility for
studying the fundamental dynamics of turbulence and turbulent suspensions.

explore the systematic error associated with fits to the Q^2 dependence of
lattice data for the hadronic electromagnetic current polarization function
which have been used in attempts to compute the leading order hadronic
contribution, a_\mu^HLO, to the muon anomalous magnetic moment. In contrast to
recent claims made in the literature, we find that a final error in this

vacuum polarization at low Q^2. We also find that fits to the vacuum

unreliable, in that the fit error on a_\mu^HLO is typically much smaller than
the difference between the value obtained from the fit and the exact model
value. The use of a sequence of Pade approximants known to converge to the true
vacuum polarization appears to represent a more promising approach.

magnitude, obtaining astrometry, photometry, and low resolution
spectrophotometry on one billion astronomical sources, plus radial velocities
for over one hundred million stars. Its main objective is to take a census of
the stellar content of our Galaxy, with the goal of revealing its formation and
evolution. Gaia's unique feature is the measurement of parallaxes and proper
motions with hitherto unparalleled accuracy for many objects. As a survey, the
physical properties of most of these objects are unknown. Here we describe the
data analysis system put together by the Gaia consortium to classify these
objects and to infer their astrophysical properties using the satellite's data.
This system covers single stars, (unresolved) binary stars, quasars, and
galaxies, all covering a wide parameter space. Multiple methods are used for
many types of stars, producing multiple results for the end user according to
different models and assumptions. Prior to its application to real Gaia data
the accuracy of these methods cannot be assessed definitively. But as an
example of the current performance, we can attain internal accuracies (RMS
residuals) on F,G,K,M dwarfs and giants at G=15 (V=15-17) for a wide range of
metallicites and interstellar extinctions of around 100K in effective
temperature (Teff), 0.1mag in extinction (A0), 0.2dex in metallicity ([Fe/H]),
and 0.25dex in surface gravity (logg). The accuracy is a strong function of the
parameters themselves, varying by a factor of more than two up or down over
this parameter range. After its launch in November 2013, Gaia will nominally
observe for five years, during which the system we describe will continue to
evolve in light of experience with the real data.

naturally stabilizes the column generation. As recently presented in the

interest and several models for a Xe reservoir have been proposed. Whether the
missing Xe is hiding in the Earth's core has remained a long unanswered
question. The key to address this issue lies in the reactivity of Xe with iron
(Fe, the main constituent of the Earth's core), which has been denied by
earlier studies. Here we report on the first evidence of the chemical reaction
of Xe and Fe at the conditions of the Earth's core, predicted through
first-principles calculations and unbiased structure searching techniques. We
find that Xe and Fe form a stable, inter-metallic compound of XeFe3, adopting a
Cu3Au-type face-centered cubic structure above 183 GPa and at 4470 K. As the
result of a Xe -> Fe charge transfer, Xe loses its chemical inertness by
opening up the filled 5p electron shell and functioning as a 5p-like element,
whilst Fe is unusually negatively charged, acting as an oxidant rather than a
reductant as usual. Our work establishes that the Earth's core is a natural
reservoir for Xe storage, and possibly provides the key to unlocking the
missing Xe paradox.

fascinating web of omnipresent filamentary structures. This highly anisotropic
ingredient of the interstellar material further complicates the difficult
problem of the systematic detection and measurement of dense cores in the
strongly variable but (relatively) isotropic backgrounds. Observational
evidence that stars form in dense filaments creates severe problems for
automated source extraction methods that must reliably distinguish sources not
only from fluctuating backgrounds and noise, but also from the filamentary
structures. A previous paper presented the multi-scale, multi-wavelength source
extraction method getsources based on a fine spatial scale decomposition and
filtering of irrelevant scales from images. In this paper, a multi-scale,
multi-wavelength filament extraction method getfilaments is presented that
solves this problem, substantially improving the robustness of source
extraction with getsources in filamentary backgrounds. The main difference is
that the filaments extracted by getfilaments are now subtracted by getsources
from detection images during source extraction, greatly reducing the chances of
contaminating catalogs with spurious sources. The intimate physical
relationship between forming stars and filaments seen in Herschel observations
demands that accurate filament extraction methods must remove the contribution
of sources and that accurate source extraction methods must be able to remove
underlying filamentary structures. Source extraction with getsources now
provides researchers also with clean images of filaments, free of sources,
noise, and isotropic backgrounds.

number of nodes grows to infinity. In dimension two, the average resistance
diverges: in this case, we are able to capture its rate of growth when the
sides of the grid grow at different rates. In higher dimensions, the average
resistance is bounded uniformly in the number of nodes: in this case, we
conjecture that its value is of order $1/d$ for large $d$. We prove this fact
for hypercubes and when the side lengths go to infinity.

connectivity of nodes is constrained by geographical distance. Specifically, we
use random geometric graphs as representative examples of such spatial
networks, and study the properties of cascading failures on them in the
presence of distributed flow. The key finding of this study is that the process
of cascading failures is non-self-averaging on spatial networks, and thus,
aggregate inferences made from analyzing an ensemble of such networks lead to
incorrect conclusions when applied to a single network, no matter how large the
network is. We demonstrate that this lack of self-averaging disappears with the
introduction of a small fraction of long-range links into the network. We
simulate the well studied preemptive node removal strategy for cascade
mitigation and show that it is largely ineffective in the case of spatial
networks. We introduce an altruistic strategy designed to limit the loss of
network nodes in the event of a cascade triggering failure and show that it
performs better than the preemptive strategy. Finally, we consider a real-world
spatial network viz. a European power transmission network and validate that
our findings from the study of random geometric graphs are also borne out by
simulations of cascading failures on the empirical network.

collective stochastic coherence and synchronizability are incompatible

their response to noise is indistinguishable to that of a single element.
Therefore one can expect systems that synchronize well to have a poor
collective response to noise. Here we show that, in spite of this apparent
conflict, a certain coupling architecture is able to reconcile the two
properties. Specifically, our results reveal that weighted scale-free networks
of diffusively coupled excitable elements exhibit both high synchronizability
of their subthreshold dynamics and a good collective response to noise of their
pulsed dynamics. This is established by comparing the behavior of this system
to that of random, regular, and unweighted scale-free networks. We attribute
the optimal response of weighted scale-free networks to the link homogeneity
(with respect to node degree) provided by the weighting procedure, which
balances the degree heterogeneity typical of SFNs.

and maxima episodes, are well established, observed features of the solar

solar cycle during Maunder minima-like episodes remain ill-understood. We
explore the origin of such extreme solar activity fluctuations and the role of
dual poloidal field sources, namely the Babcock-Leighton mechanism and the
mean-field alpha effect in the dynamics of the solar cycle. We mainly
concentrate on entry and recovery from grand minima episodes such as the
Maunder minimum and the dynamics of the solar cycle. We use a kinematic solar
dynamo model with a novel set-up in which stochastic perturbations force two
distinct poloidal field alpha effects. We explore different regimes of
operation of these poloidal sources with distinct operating thresholds, to
identify the importance of each. The perturbations are implemented
independently in both hemispheres which allows one to study the level of
hemispheric coupling and hemispheric asymmetry in the emergence of sunspots.
From the simulations performed we identify a few different ways in which the
dynamo can enter a grand minima episode. While fluctuations in any of the
$\alpha$ effects can trigger intermittency we find that the mean-field alpha
effect is crucial for the recovery of the solar cycle from a grand minima
episode which a Babcock-Leighton source alone, fails to achieve. Our
simulations also demonstrate other cycle dynamics. We conclude that stochastic
fluctuations in two interacting poloidal field sources working with distinct
operating thresholds is a viable candidate for triggering episodes of extreme
solar activity and that the mean-field alpha effect capable of working on weak,
sub-equipartition fields is critical to the recovery of the solar cycle
following an extended solar minimum.

observer is governed by a non-linear integro/partial differential system where
the two independent scalar variables indexing the pixels live on the unit
sphere of the 3D Euclidian space. The observer design and analysis are strongly
simplified by coordinate-free differential calculus on the unit sphere equipped
with its natural Riemannian structure. The observer convergence is investigated
under C^1 regularity assumptions on the object motion and its scene. It relies
on Ascoli-Arzela theorem and pre-compactness of the observer trajectories. It
is proved that the estimated biases converge towards the true ones, if and only
if, the scene admits no cylindrical symmetry. The observer design can be
adapted to realistic sensors where brightness and depth data are only available

deterministic capacities, provided that \sigma does not converge to 0 too fast.
We then establish scaling limits for the harmonic measure flow, showing that by
letting \alpha tend to 0 at different rates it converges to either the Brownian
web on the circle, a stopped version of the Brownian web on the circle, or the
identity map. As the harmonic measure flow is closely related to the internal
branching structure within the cluster, the above three cases intuitively

the basis for user participation and engagement. Groups are created explicitly
by members of the community, but also form organically as members interact. Due
to their importance, they have been studied widely (e.g., community detection,
evolution, activity, etc.). One of the key questions for understanding how such
groups evolve is whether there are different types of groups and how they
differ. In Sociology, theories have been proposed to help explain how such
groups form. In particular, the common identity and common bond theory states
that people join groups based on identity (i.e., interest in the topics
discussed) or bond attachment (i.e., social relationships). The theory has been
applied qualitatively to small groups to classify them as either topical or
social. We use the identity and bond theory to define a set of features to
classify groups into those two categories. Using a dataset from Flickr, we
extract user-defined groups and automatically-detected groups, obtained from a
community detection algorithm. We discuss the process of manual labeling of
groups into social or topical and present results of predicting the group label
based on the defined features. We directly validate the predictions of the
theory showing that the metrics are able to forecast the group type with high
accuracy. In addition, we present a comparison between declared and detected
groups along topicality and sociality dimensions.

determinations of fundamental constants. In addition to very precise frequency
measurements, the molar polarizability of an atomic gas has recently also been
measured very accurately. Part of the motivation for the measurements is due to
ongoing efforts to redefine the International System of Units (SI) for which an
accurate value of the Boltzmann constant is needed. Here, we calculate the
dominant shift of the molar polarizability in an atomic gas due to thermal
effects. It is given by the relativistic correction to the dipole interaction,
which emerges when the probing electric field is Lorenz transformed into the
rest frame of the atoms that undergo thermal motion. While this effect is small
when compared to currently available experimental accuracy, the relativistic
correction to the dipole interaction is much larger than the thermal shift of
the polarizability induced by blackbody radiation.

droplet detectors (SDD) are usually very unstable unless the detector is
fabricated using a suitable additive, which stabilizes the detector. The SDD is
known to have superheated droplets distributed in a short-lived and in a

response to neutrons using a 241AmBe neutron source and obtained the

graph with both attractive and repulsive links. At each time instant, a node is
randomly selected to interact with a random neighbor. Depending on if the link
between the two nodes belongs to a given subgraph of attractive or repulsive
links, the node update follows a standard attractive weighted average or a
repulsive weighted average, respectively. The repulsive update has the opposite
sign of the standard consensus update. In this way, it counteracts the
consensus formation and can be seen as a model of link faults or malicious
attacks in a communication network, or the impact of trust and antagonism in a
social network. Various probabilistic convergence and divergence conditions are
established. A threshold condition for the strength of the repulsive action is
given for convergence in expectation: when the repulsive weight crosses this
threshold value, the algorithm transits from convergence to divergence. An
explicit value of the threshold is derived for classes of attractive and
repulsive graphs. The results show that a single repulsive link can sometimes
drastically change the behavior of the consensus algorithm. They also
explicitly show how the robustness of the consensus algorithm depends on the
size and other properties of the graphs.

relating to machine learning theory and statistics. Two simple types of VC
classes which have been widely studied are the maximum classes (those which are
extremal with respect to Sauer's lemma) and so-called Dudley classes, which
arise as sets of positivity for linearly parameterized functions. These two
types of VC class were related by Floyd, who gave sufficient conditions for
when a Dudley class is maximum. It is widely known that Floyd's condition
applies to positive Euclidean half-spaces and certain other classes, such as
sets of positivity for univariate polynomials.
  In this paper we show that Floyd's lemma applies to a wider class of linearly
parameterized functions than has been formally recognized to date. In
particular we show that, modulo some minor technicalities, the sets of
positivity for any linear combination of real analytic functions is maximum on
points in general position. This includes sets of positivity for multivariate
polynomials as a special case.

the effect of collaboration on innovation. We find that statistically inventor
teams slightly outperform solo inventors while company teams perform equally
well as solo companies. By tracking the performance record of individual teams
we find that inventor teams' performance generally degrades with more repeat
collaborations. Though company teams' performance displays strongly bursty
behavior, long-term collaboration does not significantly help innovation at
all. To systematically study the effect of repeat collaboration, we define the
repeat collaboration number of a team as the average number of collaborations
over all the teammate pairs. We find that mild repeat collaboration improves
the performance of Japanese inventor teams and U.S. company teams. Yet,
excessive repeat collaboration does not significantly help innovation at both
the inventor and company levels in both countries. To control for unobserved
heterogeneity, we perform a detailed regression analysis and the results are
consistent with our simple observations. The presented results reveal the
intricate effect of collaboration on innovation, which may also be observed in
other creative projects.

common approach is to neglect the dynamics and see the problem as a sequence of
independent problems. This approach has two disadvantages. Firstly, the
temporal dependency in the state could be used to improve the accuracy of the
state estimates. Secondly, having an estimate for the state and its support
could be used to reduce the computational load of the subsequent step. In the
linear Gaussian setting, compressive sensing was recently combined with the
Kalman filter to mitigate above disadvantages. In the nonlinear dynamical case,
compressive sensing can not be used and, if the state dimension is high, the
particle filter would perform poorly. In this paper we combine one of the most
novel developments in compressive sensing, nonlinear compressive sensing, with
the particle filter. We show that the marriage of the two is essential and that
neither the particle filter or nonlinear compressive sensing alone gives a
satisfying solution.

second-harmonic generation of two non-collinear incident light beams that carry
orbital angular momentum (OAM). More specifically, the two incident beams
generate a third that, depending on the incident OAM, may experience a
significantly smaller conversion efficiency in comparison to that based on the
conventional phase-matching theory. This is the case even for incident angles
substantially less than those required for non-conservation of OAM in the
nonlinear interaction. Experiments are performed under different conditions and
are in excellent agreement with the theory. Our results have implications
beyond the specific case studied here of second-harmonic generation, in
particular for parametric down-conversion of photons.

relies on a set of candidate unifilar HMM (uHMM) topologies for inference of

enumeration of topological epsilon-machines. (A sequel then removes the
topological restriction.) This subset of the uHMM topologies has the added
benefit that inferred models are guaranteed to be epsilon-machines,

epsilon-machines and uHMMs allow for the derivation of analytic expressions for
estimating transition probabilities, inferring start states, and comparing the
posterior probability of candidate model topologies, despite process internal

effectiveness in estimating a process's randomness, as reflected by the Shannon
entropy rate, and its structure, as quantified by the statistical complexity.
We also compare using the posterior distribution over candidate models and the
single, maximum a posteriori model for point estimation and show that the
former more accurately reflects uncertainty in estimated values. We apply BSI

the regions of both the outer hotspots have close to power-law (rather than

material ejected in the previous episode just before the central engine stopped

the evolution of the primordial Vesta, in particular in terms of crater
saturation, crustal excavation and surface erosion. Both scenarios assuming the
planetesimals having formed in a quiescent or a turbulent nebula were explored
and both primordial and collisionally evolved size-frequency distributions were
considered. The results obtained indicate that, if the basaltic surface of
Vesta were already formed, the JEB would saturate it with craters and could
erode it to depths that vary from hundreds of meters to tens of kilometres. In
the latter cases, the surface erosion caused by the JEB would be comparable
with the thickness of the eucritic and diogenitic layers of Vesta. In the cases
where the global surface erosion is limited, however, large impactors, if too
abundant, can excavate the whole crust and extract significant quantities of
material from the vestan mantle, incompatible with the present understanding of
HED meteorites. This appears to be the case if the impacting planetesimals
formed in a turbulent nebula and Jupiter migrated by 0.5 AU or more. Globally,
the results obtained suggest that the scenarios where the planetesimal formed
in a quiescent nebula and Jupiter underwent a modest migration (i.e. up to 0.5
AU) are the most consistent with our understanding of Vesta, even if the cases
of planetesimals formed in a turbulent nebula with Jupiter undergoing limited
(i.e. about 0.25 AU) or no migration cannot be ruled out. Recent results on the
differentiation of the asteroid, however, raised the possibility that Vesta
originally possessed a now-lost undifferentiated crust. In this case, the
favoured scenarios would be those where the planetesimals formed in a quiescent
nebula and Jupiter underwent a more significant migration (i.e. between 0.5 AU

result which might be considered surprising given the very different lobe
dynamics expected in the first and second episode. We construct models for the
dynamics of radio galaxies, with an emphasis on their episodic behaviour, and
show that hotspot formation and confinement of lobes for the inner double of
double-double radio galaxies are possible even without any thermal matter in
the outer cocoon. We argue that (i) the observed similar injection spectral
indices are due to similar jet powers in the two episodes, (ii) the `spectral
index--radio power' correlation of a flux limited sample of radio galaxies is
the primary one, and not the `spectral index--redshift correlation', (iii) jets
are made of pair plasma and not electron-proton, (iv) and the Lorentz factor of

Furthermore, we argue that the observations show that higher power radio

a higher number density of particles in the jet rest frame. A consequence of
our models is that aligned double-double radio galaxies with very old

on correlation functions in gauge-fixed Yang-Mills theories, in particular in
the low momentum regime where standard perturbation theory based on the
Faddeev-Popov approach fails. Recent results, derived from functional tools
(Dyson-Schwinger equations or exact RG) or the effective Gribov-Zwanziger
action method, pointed towards e.g. gauge boson correlation functions that are
not compatible with the properties of observable degrees of freedom. Although
such an observation is a welcome feature for gauge theories exhibiting
confinement, it would be a discomfort for gauge theories supplemented with
Higgs fields, cfr. the experimental success of the electroweak model based on a
SU(2) x U(1) gauge group. The purpose of this short note is to assure that the
effective action resolution to the Gribov ambiguity reduces to the standard
Faddeev-Popov method in the perturbative regime of sufficiently small
coupling/large Higgs condensate, thereby not compromising the physical particle
spectrum of massive gauge bosons and a massless photon for the SU(2) x U(1)
gauge-Higgs model. The closer the theory gets to the limit of vanishing Higgs
condensate, the more the Gribov problem resurfaces with all its consequences.

the imposition of topological constraints like semi-positivity on the

very appealing approach that removed most of these restrictions is the approach

other approaches using abstract perturbation theory, it has the advantage that
the objects to be studied still are spaces of holomorphic maps defined on
Riemann surfaces.

each other via a nearest-neighbor (NN) exchange $J$ and competing interactions
taken from a truncated dipolar coupling. Each dimer occupies a link between two
nearest sites of a simple cubic lattice. We suppose that dimers are
self-avoiding and can have only three orientations which coincide with the $x$,
$y$ or $z$ direction. The interaction $J$ is attractive if the two dimers are
parallel with each other at the NN distance, zero otherwise. The truncated
dipolar interaction is characterized by two parameters: its amplitude $D$ and
the cutoff distance $r_c$. Using the steepest-descent method, we determine the
ground-state (GS) configuration as functions of $D$ and $r_c$. We then use
Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the nature of the low-temperature phase
and to determine characteristics of the phase transition from the ordered phase
to the disordered phase at high temperatures at a given dimer concentration. We
show that as the temperature increases, dimers remain in the compact state and
the transition from the low-$T$ compact phase to the disordered phase where
dimers occupy the whole space is of second order when $D$ is small, but it
becomes of first order for large enough $D$, for both polarized and non
polarized dimers. This transition has a resemblance with the unfolding polymer
transition. The effect of $r_c$ is discussed.

to transverse space velocities of $350\pm100\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ and

arbitrary choices for the routing of internal momenta and symmetry violating
terms. In the present work we extend a previous one on the same issue by
including vector interactions and performing the discussion in a more general
context: it is considered the role of scale arbitrariness for the consistency
of the calculations. We show that the imposition of arbitrary scale
independence for the consistent regularized amplitudes lead to additional
properties for the irreducible divergent objects. These properties allow us to
parametrize the remaining freedom in terms of a unique constant where resides
all the arbitrariness involved. By searching for the best value for the
arbitrary parameter we find a critical condition for the existence of an
acceptable physical value for the dynamically generated quark mass. Such
critical condition fixes the remaining arbitrariness turning the NJL into a
predictive model in the sense that its phenomenological consequences do not
depend on possible choices made in intermediary steps. Numerical results are
obtained for physical quantities like the vector and axial-vector masses and
their coupling constants as genuine predictions.

subspace of a Hamiltonian which is slowly changed such that a transformation
occurs within the subspace. Following the approach of Bacon and Flammia, we
show that any measurement-based quantum computation on a graph state with

as the degree of $H$, in analogy to the trade-off between the number of

scale-invariant parameters. Concentration (C), Asymmetry (A), Smoothness (S),
the Gini index (G), relative contribution of the brightest pixels to the second
order moment of the flux (M20), ellipticity (E), and the Gini index of the
second order moment (GM) have all been applied to morphologically classify
galaxies at various wavelengths. Here we present a catalog of these parameters
for the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S4G), a volume-limited
near-infrared imaging survey of nearby galaxies using the 3.6 and 4.5 micron
channels of the IRAC camera. Our goal is to provide a reference catalog of
near-infrared quantified morphology for high-redshift studies and galaxy
evolution models with enough detail to resolve stellar mass morphology.
  We explore where normal, non-interacting galaxies -those typically found on
the Hubble tuning fork- lie in this parameter space and show that there is a
tight relation between Concentration and M20 for normal galaxies. M20 can be
used to classify galaxies into earlier and later types (e.g., to separate
spirals from irregulars). Several criteria using these parameters exist to
select systems with a disturbed morphology, i.e., those that appear to be
undergoing a tidal interaction. We examine the applicability of these criteria
to Spitzer near-infrared imaging. We find that four relations, based on the
parameters A&S, G&M20, GM, and C&M20, respectively, select outliers in the
morphological parameter space, but each selects different subsets of galaxies.
Two criteria (GM > 0.6, G > -0.115 x M20 + 0.384) seem most appropriate to
identify possible mergers and the merger fraction in near-infrared surveys. We
find no strong relation between lopsidedness and most of these morphological
parameters, except for a weak dependence of lopsidedness on Concentration and
M20.

heavy gravitinos, followed by possible R-parity violating decays in the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) can generate the baryon asymmetry of the

carried by squarks or sleptons. These particles then decay through R-parity
violating operators generating a lepton asymmetry. The lepton asymmetry is
converted into a baryon asymmetry by weak sphalerons, as in the familiar case
of leptogenesis by Majorana neutrino decays. To ensure that the gravitino
decays while the sphaleron is still in equilibrium, we obtain a lower bound on
the gravitino mass, $m_{3/2} \gtrsim 10^{8} \GeV$, and therefore our mechanism
requires a high scale of SUSY breaking, as well as minimum reheating
temperature after inflation of $T\gtrsim 10^{12} \GeV$ in order to for the
gravitino density to be sufficiently large to generate the baryon asymmetry
today. We consider each of the MSSM's relevant R-parity violating operators in
turn, and derive constraints on parameters in order to give rise to a baryon
asymmetry comparable to that observed today, consistent with low energy
phenomenological bounds on SUSY models.

crystals have recently attracted much interest. Very high carrier mobility in a
graphene-on-boron nitride assembly is now well-established, but it has been
anticipated that appropriately designed hybrids could perform other tasks as
well. A heterostructure of graphene and molybdenum disulphide (MoS$_2$) is
expected to be sensitive to photo illumination due to the optical bandgap in
MoS$_2$. Despite significant advances in device architectures with both
graphene and MoS$_2$, binary graphene-MoS$_2$ hybrids have not been realized so
far, and the promising opto-electronic properties of such structures remain
elusive. Here we demonstrate experimentally that graphene-on-MoS$_2$ binary
heterostructures display an unexpected and remarkable persistent
photoconductivity under illumination of white light. The photoconductivity can
not only be tuned independently with both light intensity and back gate
voltage, but in response to a suitable combination of light and gate voltage
pulses the device functions as a re-writable optoelectronic switch or memory.
The persistent, or `ON', state shows virtually no relaxation or decay within
the the experimental time scales for low and moderate photoexcitation
intensity, indicating a near-perfect charge retention. A microscopic model
associates the persistence with strong localization of carriers in MoS$_2$.
These effects are also observable at room temperature, and with chemical vapour
deposited graphene, and hence are naturally scalable for large area
applications.

in a Coulomb system depends upon precisely what question is being asked. It is
shown that equilibrium (equation-of-state) phenomena and non-equilibrium
dynamical processes like photoionization are characterised by different values
of the IPD. In the former, the ionization potential of an atom embedded in
matter is the difference in the free energy of the many-body system between
states of thermodynamic equilibrium differing by the ionization state of just
one atom. Typically, this energy is less than that required to ionize the same
atom in vacuo. Probably, the best known example of such an IPD is that of
Stewart and Pyatt (SP). However, it is a common misconception that this formula
should apply directly to the energy of a photon causing photoionization, since
this is a local adiabatic process that occurs in the absence of a response from
the surrounding plasma. To achieve the prescribed final equilibrium state,
additional energy, in the form of heat and work, is transferred between the
atom and its surroundings. This additional relaxation energy is sufficient to
explain the discrepancy between recent spectroscopic measurements of IPD in
dense plasmas and the predictions of the SP formula. This paper provides a
detailed account of an analytical approach to calculating thermodynamic and
spectroscopic (adiabatic) IPDs in multicomponent Coulomb systems of arbitrary
coupling strength. The ramifications are carefully examined in order to
elucidate the roles of the various IPD forms. A formulation in terms of free
energy leads to an analytical equation of state (EoS) that is thermodynamically
self-consistent, provided that the bound and free electrons are dynamically
separable. Of the various proposed formulae, the Spectroscopic (adiabatic) IPD
gives the most consistent agreement with spectroscopic measurements.

them. Our reported $\sim$ 190 days TTV signal can be reproduced by either a
weak perturber in resonance with Qatar-1b, or by a massive body in the brown

However, the number and type of rigorously non-diffracting beams is severely

where the Helmholtz equation governing beam propagation is separable. Here, we
demonstrate a powerful technique that allows the generation of a rich variety
of quasi-non-diffracting optical beams featuring nearly arbitrary intensity
distributions in the transverse plane. These can be readily engineered via
modifications of the angular spectrum of the beam in order to meet the
requirements of particular applications. Such beams are not rigorously
non-diffracting but they maintain their shape over large distances, which may
be tuned by varying the width of the angular spectrum. We report the generation
of unique spiral patterns and patterns involving arbitrary combinations of
truncated harmonic, Bessel, Mathieu, or parabolic beams occupying different

spectroscopic analysis, measuring the electron temperature by modeling the
continuum and comparing it to the temperature given by the flux ratio of the
He-like and H-like lines of sulfur and of argon. Using these results, we find
that W49B is overionized in the west, with a gradient of increasing
overionization from east to west. As the ejecta expansion is impeded by
molecular material in the east but not in the west, our overionization maps
suggest the dominant cooling mechanism is adiabatic expansion of the hot

result of planetary secular perturbations to the disk inclination. In addition,

evidence of system-wide star - planet - disk alignment is therefore emerging,
with the exception of systems that host hot Jupiters. While this alignment

in estimating technologically relevant parameters such as phase, frequency, or
magnetic fields. Probe states are usually tailored on the particular dynamics
whose parameters are being estimated. Here we consider a novel framework where
quantum estimation is performed in an interferometric configuration, using
bipartite probe states prepared when only the spectrum of the generating
Hamiltonian is known. We introduce a figure of merit for the scheme, given by
the worst case precision over all suitable Hamiltonians, and prove that it
amounts exactly to a computable measure of discord-type quantum correlations
for the input probe. We complement our theoretical results with a metrology
experiment, realized in a highly controllable room-temperature nuclear magnetic
resonance setup, which provides a proof-of-concept demonstration for the
usefulness of discord in sensing applications. Discordant probes are shown to
guarantee a nonzero precision in the estimation procedure for different
generating Hamiltonians, while classically correlated probes are unable to
accomplish the estimation in a worst case setting. This work establishes a
rigorous and direct operational interpretation for general quantum
correlations, shedding light on their potential for quantum technology.

higher dimensional operator of a nonminimal scalar (complex linear) multiplet.
The latter differs from the stan- dard chiral multiplet in its auxiliary
sector, which contains, in addition to the complex scalar auxiliary of a chiral
superfield, a complex vector and two spinors auxiliaries. By adding an
appropriate higher di- mension operator, the scalar auxiliary may acquire a
nonzero vev triggering spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. We find that the
spectrum of the theory in the supersymmetry breaking vacuum consists of a free
chiral multiplet and a constraint chiral superfield describing the goldstino.
Interestingly, the latter turns out to be one of the auxiliary fermions, which
becomes dynamical in the supersymmetry breaking vacuum. In all cases we are
considering here, there is no sgoldstino mode and thus the goldstino does not
have a superpartner. The sgoldstino is decoupled since the goldstino is one of

developed in the companion paper. We computed for each 3D model the theoretical
power density spectrum (PDS) associated with the granulation as seen in
disk-integrated intensity on the basis of the theoretical model. For each PDS
we derived tau_eff and sigma and compared these theoretical values with the
theoretical scaling relations derived from the theoretical model and the Kepler

which show the same dependence on nu_max as the observed scaling relations. In
addition, we show that these quantities also scale as a function of the
turbulent Mach number (Ma) estimated at the photosphere. The theoretical
scaling relations for tau_eff and sigma match the observations well on a global
scale. Our modelling provides additional theoretical support for the observed
variations of sigma and tau_eff with nu_m max. It also highlights the important
role of Ma in controlling the properties of the stellar granulation. However,
the observations made with Kepler on a wide variety of stars cannot confirm the
dependence of our scaling relations on Ma. Measurements of the granulation
background and detections of solar-like oscillations in a statistically

topological field theories (TQFTs) by considering their compactifications to 2
dimensions. These TQFTs control the long-distance behavior of loop and surface
operators in 4d gauge theories with gapped phases. These were recently used in
work by S. Gukov and A. Kapustin in detecting phases not distinguishable by the
Wilson-'t Hooft criterion and by A. Kapustin and the author to construct
discrete theta-angles for lattice Yang-Mills theories. The strong-weak duality
is manifested in an exchange of dynamical and background degrees of freedom in
the compactified TQFTs.

fluctuating, inhomogeneous structure of such nano-scale systems. In contrast to
bulk materials, nano-scale systems exhibit substantial fluctuations in energy,
charge, and other extensive quantities as well as large surface effects. The
DSD is driven by the stochastic librational motion of the center of mass and
fluxional bonding at the nanoparticle surface due to thermal coupling with the
substrate. Our approach for calculating DSD is based on a combination of
statistical mechanics, transient coupled-oscillator models, and real-time
DFT/MD simulations. This approach treats thermal and dynamic effects over
multiple time-scales, including bond-stretching and -bending vibrations, DSD,
and transient tethering to the substrate at longer ps time-scales. Model
calculations of molecule-cluster interactions and molecular dissociation
reaction paths are presented in which the reactant molecules are adsorbed on
the surface of dynamically sampled clusters. This model suggests that DSD
affects both the prefactors and distribution of energy barriers in reaction
rates, and thus can strongly affect catalytic activity at the nano-scale.

Given the planets' short orbital periods, building the requisite
signal-to-noise to detect the candidates by stacking multiple transits requires
a much shorter observational baseline than for longer-period planets, and the
transits are likely more robust against the much larger instrumental variations
anticipated for the modified Kepler pointing capabilities. Searching for these
unusual planets will also leverage the Kepler mission's already considerable
expertise in planetary transit detection and analysis. These candidates may
represent an entirely new class of planet. They may also provide unprecedented
insights into planet formation and evolution and sensitive probes for
planet-star interactions and the stellar wind. Whatever their origins and

this problem, and its generalization to $N$ dimensions, allows us to discover a
quantized form of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) Lemma, i.e., one that combines
a linear dimensionality reduction procedure with a uniform quantization of
precision $\delta>0$. In particular, given a finite set $\mathcal S \subset
\mathbb R^N$ of $S$ points and a distortion level $\epsilon>0$, as soon as $M >
M_0 = O(\epsilon^{-2} \log S)$, we can (randomly) construct a mapping from
$(\mathcal S, \ell_2)$ to $(\delta\mathbb Z^M, \ell_1)$ that approximately
preserves the pairwise distances between the points of $\mathcal S$.
Interestingly, compared to the common JL Lemma, the mapping is quasi-isometric
and we observe both an additive and a multiplicative distortions on the
embedded distances. These two distortions, however, decay as $O(\sqrt{(\log
S)/M})$ when $M$ increases. Moreover, for coarse quantization, i.e., for high
$\delta$ compared to the set radius, the distortion is mainly additive, while
for small $\delta$ we tend to a Lipschitz isometric embedding. Finally, we
prove the existence of a ""nearly"" quasi-isometric embedding of $(\mathcal S,
\ell_2)$ into $(\delta\mathbb Z^M, \ell_2)$. This one involves a non-linear
distortion of the $\ell_2$-distance in $\mathcal S$ that vanishes for distant
points in this set. Noticeably, the additive distortion in this case is slower,

Here, the scattering from water, specifically light water, was measured on the
EQ-SANS instrument, a time-of-flight SANS instrument located at the Spallation
Neutron Source of Oak Ridge National Laboratory. A significant inelastic
process was observed in the TOF spectra of neutrons scattered from water.
Analysis of the TOF spectra from the sample showed that the scattered neutrons
have energies consistent with room-temperature thermal energies (~20 meV)
regardless of the incident neutron energy. With the aid of Monte Carlo particle
transport simulations, we conclude that the thermalization process within the
sample results in faster neutrons that arrive at the detector earlier than
expected based on the incident neutron energies. This thermalization process
impacts the measured SANS intensities in a manner that will ultimately be
sample- and temperature-dependent, necessitating careful processing of the raw
data into the SANS cross-section.

fast-faded multiple-input multiple-output multiple-antenna-eavesdropper
(MIMOME) wiretap channels with only statistical channel state information at
the transmitter (CSIT). When the legitimate receiver has more (or equal)
antennas than the eavesdropper, we prove the first MIMOME secrecy capacity with
partial CSIT by establishing a new secrecy capacity upper-bound. The key step
is to form an MIMOME degraded channel by dividing the legitimate receiver's
channel matrix into two submatrices, and setting one of the submatrices to be
the same as the eavesdropper's channel matrix. Next, under the total power
constraint over all transmit antennas, we analytically solve the channel-input
covariance matrix optimization problem to fully characterize the MIMOME secrecy
capacity. Typically, the MIMOME optimization problems are non-concave. However,
thank to the proposed degraded channel, we can transform the stochastic MIMOME
optimization problem to be a Schur-concave one and then find its solution.
Besides total power constraint, we also investigate the secrecy capacity when
the transmitter is subject to the practical per-antenna power constraint. The
corresponding optimization problem is even more difficult since it is not
Schuar-concave. Under the two power constraints considered, the corresponding
MIMOME secrecy capacities can both scale with the signal-to-noise ratios (SNR)
when the difference between numbers of antennas at legitimate receiver and
eavesdropper are large enough. However, when the legitimate receiver and
eavesdropper have a single antenna each, such SNR scalings do not exist for
both cases.

abundances of the stars in the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Fornax dSph)
provide excellent information for setting constraints on the models of the

approach, we fit the abundances of the Fornax dSph stars, including $\alpha$
elements, iron group elements and neutron-capture elements. For most sample
stars, the relative contributions from the various processes to the elemental
abundances are not usually in the MW proportions. We find that the
contributions from massive stars to the primary $\alpha$ elements and iron
group elements increase monotonously with increasing [Fe/H]. This means that
the effect of the galactic wind is not strong enough to halt star formation and
the contributions from massive stars to $\alpha$ elements did not halted for
[Fe/H]$\lesssim$-0.5. The average contributed ratios of various processes
between the dSph stars and the MW stars monotonously decrease with increasing
progenitor mass. This is important evidence of a bottom-heavy initial mass
function (IMF) for the Fonax dSph, compared to the MW. Considering a
bottom-heavy IMF for the dSph, the observed relations of [$\alpha$/Fe] versus
[Fe/H], [iron group/Fe] versus [Fe/H] and [neutron-capture/Fe] versus [Fe/H]

is believed to have been formed when a high-speed intruder to the group
collided with clumpy intergroup gas. Observations with the PACS spectrometer
provide evidence for broad (> 1000 km s^-1) luminous [CII] line profiles, as
well as fainter [OI]63micron emission. SPIRE FTS observations reveal water
emission from the p-H2O (111-000) transition at several positions in the
filament, but no other molecular lines. The H2O line is narrow, and may be
associated with denser intermediate-velocity gas experiencing the strongest
shock-heating. The [CII]/PAH{tot) and [CII]/FIR ratios are too large to be
explained by normal photo-electric heating in PDRs. HII region excitation or
X-ray/Cosmic Ray heating can also be ruled out. The observations lead to the
conclusion that a large fraction the molecular gas is diffuse and warm. We
propose that the [CII], [OI] and warm H2 line emission is powered by a
turbulent cascade in which kinetic energy from the galaxy collision with the
IGM is dissipated to small scales and low-velocities, via shocks and turbulent
eddies. Low-velocity magnetic shocks can help explain both the [CII]/[OI]
ratio, and the relatively high [CII]/H2 ratios observed. The discovery that
[CII] emission can be enhanced, in large-scale turbulent regions in collisional
environments has implications for the interpretation of [CII] emission in
high-z galaxies.

Andreev reflections (SESARs), in which incoming electrons with certain spin
polarization in the lead are reflected as counter propagating holes with the
same spin. The spin polarization direction of the electrons of this Andreev
reflected channel is selected by the Majorana fermions. Moreover, electrons
with opposite spin polarization are always reflected as electrons with
unchanged spin. As a result, the charge current in the lead is spin-polarized.
Therefore, a topological superconductor which supports Majorana fermions can be
used as a novel device to create fully spin-polarized currents in paramagnetic
leads. We point out that SESARs can also be used to detect Majorana fermions in
topological superconductors.

Recent works on the subject often use nuclear norm as a convex surrogate of the
rank function. Despite its solid theoretical foundation, the convex version of
the problem often fails to work satisfactorily in real-life applications. Real
data often suffer from very few observations, with support not meeting the
random requirements, ubiquitous presence of noise and potentially gross
corruptions, sometimes with these simultaneously occurring.
  This paper proposes a Proximal Alternating Robust Subspace Minimization
(PARSuMi) method to tackle the three problems. The proximal alternating scheme
explicitly exploits the rank constraint on the completed matrix and uses the
$\ell_0$ pseudo-norm directly in the corruption recovery step. We show that the
proposed method for the non-convex and non-smooth model converges to a
stationary point. Although it is not guaranteed to find the global optimal
solution, in practice we find that our algorithm can typically arrive at a good
local minimizer when it is supplied with a reasonably good starting point based
on convex optimization. Extensive experiments with challenging synthetic and
real data demonstrate that our algorithm succeeds in a much larger range of
practical problems where convex optimization fails, and it also outperforms
various state-of-the-art algorithms.

larger than the Hyades value. We suggest that, based on our theoretical and
observational understanding of Galactic chemical evolution, nitrogen abundances
may serve as a proxy for helium abundances of disk stars. Utilizing
high-resolution near-UV Keck/HIRES spectroscopy, we determine N abundances in
the Pleiades and Hyades dwarfs from NH features in the 3330 Ang region. While
our Hyades N abundances show a modest 0.2 dex trend over a 800 K Teff range, we
find the Pleiades N abundance (by number) is 0.13+/-0.05 dex lower than in the
Hyades for stars in a smaller overlapping Teff range around 6000 K; possible
systematic errors in the lower Pleiades N abundance result are estimated to be
at the <0.10 dex level. Our results indicate [N/Fe]=0 for both the Pleiades and
Hyades, consistent with the ratios exhibited by local Galactic disk field stars
in other studies. If N production is a reliable tracer of He production in the
disk, then our results suggest the Pleiades He abundance is no larger than that
in the Hyades. This finding is supported by the relative Pleiades-Hyades C, O,
and Fe abundances interpreted in the current context of Galactic chemical
evolution, and is resistant to the effects on our derived N abundances of a He
abundance difference like that needed to explain the Pleiades distance modulus
discrepancy. A physical explanation of the Pleiades distance modulus
discrepancy does not appear to be related to He abundance.

electromagnetic (EM) counterpart to gravitational wave detections (GW) during
the early years of only two advanced interferometers. The perils of such a
search may have appeared insurmountable when considering the coarse ring-shaped
GW localizations spanning thousands of deg^2 using time-of-arrival information
alone. We show that leveraging the amplitude and phase information of the
predicted GW signal narrows the localization to arcs with a median area of only
~250 deg^2, thereby making an EM search tractable. Based on the locations and
orientations of the two LIGO detectors, we find that the GW sensitivity is
limited to one polarization and thus to only two sky quadrants. Thus, the rates
of GW events with two interferometers is only ~40% of the rate with three
interferometers of similar sensitivity. Another important implication of the
sky quadrant bias is that EM observatories in North America and Southern Africa
would be able to systematically respond to GW triggers several hours sooner
than Russia and Chile. Given the larger sky areas and the relative proximity of
detected mergers, 1m-class telescopes with very wide-field cameras are well
positioned for the challenge of finding an EM counterpart. Identification of
the EM counterpart amidst the even larger numbers of false positives further
underscores the importance of building a comprehensive catalog of foreground
stellar sources, background AGN and potential host galaxies in the local
universe.

proposed, referred to as tree-based Chase-type algorithm}. The proposed

testing patterns, and hence definitely delivers the most-likely codeword
provided that the computational resources are allowed. All the testing patterns
are arranged in an ordered rooted tree according to the likelihood bounds of
the possibly generated codewords, which is an extension of Wu and Pados' method
from binary into $q$-ary linear block codes. While performing the algorithm,
the ordered rooted tree is constructed progressively by adding at most two
leafs at each trial. The ordered tree naturally induces a sufficient condition
for the most-likely codeword. That is, whenever the tree-based Chase-type
algorithm exits before a preset maximum number of trials is reached, the output
codeword must be the most-likely one. But, in fact, the algorithm can be
terminated by setting a discrepancy threshold instead of a maximum number of
trials. When the tree-based Chase-type algorithm is combined with
Guruswami-Sudan (GS) algorithm, each trial can be implement in an extremely
simple way by removing from the gradually updated Grobner basis one old point
and interpolating one new point. Simulation results show that the tree-based
Chase-type algorithm performs better than the recently proposed Chase-type
algorithm by Bellorado et al with less trials (on average) given that the
maximum number of trials is the same.

the seed for a cis > trans SNARE gradient that generates the predominantly
retrograde vesicle flux which further enhances the gradient. This flux in turn
yields the observed inhomogeneous steady-state distribution of Golgi enzymes,
which compete with each other and with the SNAREs for incorporation into
transport vesicles. We show analytically that the steady state SNARE
concentration decays exponentially with the cisterna number. Numerical
solutions of rate equations reproduce the experimentally observed SNARE
gradients, overlapping enzyme peaks in cis, medial and trans and the reported
change in vesicle nature across Golgi: Vesicles originating from younger
cisternae mostly contain Golgi enzymes and SNAREs enriched in these cisternae

subpopulation of vesicles contains Golgi proteins prevalent in older cisternae

the accuracy of the standard SED-fitting technique, finding it is not accurate
enough to provide reliable estimates of the galaxy physical parameters. We then
develop a new SED-fitting method that includes the IR luminosity as a prior and
a generalized Calzetti law with a variable RV . Then we exploit such a new
method to re-analyze our galaxy sample, and to robustly determine SFRs, stellar
masses and ages. We find that there is a general trend of increasing
attenuation with the SFR. Moreover, we find that the SFRs range between a few

masses, while the ages from a few tens of Myr to more than 1 Gyr. We discuss
how individual age easurements of highly attenuated objects indicate that dust
must form within a few tens of Myr and be copious already at ~100 Myr. In
addition, we find that low luminous galaxies harbor, on average, significantly
older stellar populations and are also less massive than brighter ones; we
discuss how these findings and the well known 'downsizing' scenario are
consistent in a framework where less massive galaxies form first, but their
star formation lasts longer. Finally, we find that the near-IR attenuation is

via quantum tunneling from the background false vacuum state. Our universe
lives inside the bubble, which can be described as a
Friedman-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe with negative spatial
curvature, undergoing slow-roll inflation. We pay special attention to the
issue of an initial state for quantum fluctuations. A ""vacuum state"" defined by
a positive-frequency mode in de Sitter space charted by open coordinates is
different from the Euclidean vacuum (which is equivalent to the so-called
""Bunch-Davies vacuum""). Quantum tunneling then modifies the initial state away
from the original Euclidean vacuum. While most of the previous study on
modifications of the initial quantum state introduces, by hand, an initial time
at which the quantum state is modified as well as the form of the modification,
an effective initial time naturally emerges and the form is fixed by quantum
tunneling in open inflation models. Therefore, open inflation enables a
self-consistent computation of the effect of a modified initial state on the
bispectrum. We find a term which goes as <\zeta_{k_1} \zeta_{k_2} \zeta_{k_3}>
\propto 1/k_1^2k_3^4 in the so-called squeezed configurations, k_3\ll
k_1\approx k_2, in agreement with the previous study. The bispectrum in the
exact folded limit, e.g., k_1=k_2+k_3, is also enhanced and remains finite.
However, these terms are exponentially suppressed when the wavelength of \zeta
is smaller than the curvature radius of the universe. The leading-order
bispectrum is equal to the usual one from single-field slow-roll inflation; the
terms specific for open inflation arise only in the sub-leading order when the
wavelength of \zeta is smaller than the curvature radius.

disorder due to rough edges and random grain boundaries is calculated by a
scattering matrix method. In addition, resistance of a corresponding metallic
wire is obtained from the Landauer formula and the electron mean free path
($l$) is determined. If disorder is due to the rough edges, a ballistic
persistent current $I_{typ} \simeq e v_F/L$ is found to coexist with the
diffusive resistance ($ \propto L/l$), where $v_F$ is the Fermi velocity and $L
\gg l$ is the ring length. This ballistic current is due to a single electron
that moves almost in parallel with the rough edges and thus hits them rarely
(it is shown that this parallel motion exists in the ring geometry owing to the
Hartree-Fock interaction). Our finding agrees with a puzzling experimental
result $I_{typ}\simeq e v_F/L$, reported by Chandrasekhar et al. [Phys. Rev.
Lett. \textbf{67}, 3578 (1991)] for metallic rings of length $L \simeq 100 l$.
If disorder is due to the grain boundaries, our data reproduce theoretical
result $I_{typ}\simeq (e v_F/L) (l/L)$ that holds for the white-noise-like
disorder and has been observed in recent experiments. Thus, result
$I_{typ}\simeq e v_F/L$ in a disordered metallic ring of length $L \gg l$ is as
normal as result $I_{typ}\simeq (e v_F/L)(l/L)$. Which result is observed
depends on the nature of disorder. Experiments that would determine $I_{typ}$
and $l$ in correlation with the nature of disorder can be instructive.

system to investigate how its liquid-gas phase separation kinetics depends on
temperature. A shallow quench leads to a fully demixed liquid-gas system
whereas a deep quench makes the dense phase undergo a glass transition and
become an amorphous solid. This glass has a gel-like bicontinuous structure
that evolves very slowly with time and becomes fully arrested in the limit
where thermal fluctuations become negligible. We show that the phase separation
kinetics changes qualitatively with temperature, the microscopic dynamics
evolving from a surface tension-driven diffusive motion at high temperature to
a strongly intermittent, heterogeneous and thermally activated dynamics at low
temperature, with a logarithmically slow growth of the typical domain size.
These results shed light on recent experimental observations of various porous
materials produced by arrested spinodal decomposition, such as nonequilibrium
colloidal gels and bicontinuous polymeric structures, and they elucidate the
microscopic mechanisms underlying a specific class of viscoelastic phase
separation.

  Producing a CAD for the original formulation of this problem is still
infeasible after 25 years of improvements in both CAD theory and computer
hardware. We review some alternative formulations in the literature which use
differing levels of geometric analysis before input to a CAD algorithm. Simpler
formulations allow CAD to easily address the question of the existence of a
path. We provide a new formulation for which both a CAD can be constructed and
from which an actual path could be determined if one exists, and analyse the
CADs produced using this approach for variations of the problem.
  This emphasises the importance of the precise formulation of such problems
for CAD. We analyse the formulations and their CADs considering a variety of
heuristics and general criteria, leading to conclusions about tackling other
problems of this form.

an outstanding problem. This is due to the need for a proper treatment of

becomes even more challenging for systems with large difference in atomic size
and mass. We propose a systematic density functional theory (DFT) based study
to predict the ab-initio force constants in random alloys. The method is based
on a marriage between special quasirandom structures (SQS) and the augmented

bcc TaW and fcc NiPt alloys are considered as the two distinct test cases.
Ta-Ta (W-W) bond distance in the alloy is predicted to be smaller (larger) than
those in pure Ta (W), which, in turn, yields stiffer (softer) force constants
for Ta (W). Pt-Pt force constants in the alloy, however, are predicted to be
softer compared to Ni-Ni, due to a large bond distance of the former. Our
calculated force constants, phonon spectra and DOS are compared with
experiments and other theoretical results, wherever available. Correct trend of
present results for the two alloys pave a path for further future studies in
more complex alloy systems.

investigated at Fermi energies with a beam of 84Kr at 35AMeV. A comparison of
the <N>/Z of light and medium products forward-emitted in the centre of mass
frame when the beam impinges on a n-poor 112Sn and a n-rich 124Sn targets is
presented. Data were collected by means of a three-layer telescope with very
good performances in terms of mass identification (full isotopic resolution up
to Z about 20 for ions punching through the first detector layer) built by the
FAZIA Collaboration and located just beyond the grazing angle for both
reactions. The <N>/Z of the decay products emitted when the n-rich target is
used is always higher than that associated to the n-poor one. Since the
detector was able to measure only fragments coming from the QuasiProjectile
decay and/or neck emission, the observed behaviour can be ascribed to the
isospin diffusion, driven by the isospin gradient between QuasiProjectile and
QuasiTarget. Moreover, for light fragments the <N>/Z as a function of the lab
velocity of the fragment increases when we move from the QuasiProjectile
velocity to the centre of mass (neck zone). This effect can be interpreted as
an evidence of isospin drift driven by the density gradient between the
QuasiProjectile zone (at normal density) and the more diluted neck zone.

cosmological structure formation is that the Universe should contain a wealth
of small-scale structure -- low-mass dark matter haloes and subhaloes. However,
galaxy formation is inefficient in their shallow potential wells and so we
expect these low-mass haloes and subhaloes to be dark. Can we tell the
difference between a Universe in which low-mass haloes are present but dark and
one in which they never formed, thereby providing a robust test of the CDM
model? We address this question using cosmological simulations to examine how
properties of low-mass haloes that are potentially accessible to observation,
such as their spatial clustering, rate of accretions and mergers onto massive
galaxies and the angular momentum content of massive galaxies, differ between a
LCDM model and dark matter models in which low-mass halo formation is
suppressed. Adopting an effective cut-off mass scale M_cut below which
small-scale power is suppressed in the initial conditions, we study dark matter
models in which M_cut varies between 5e9 Msol/h and 1e11 Msol/h, equivalent to
the host haloes of dwarf and low mass galaxies. Our results show that both the
clustering strength of low-mass haloes around galaxy-mass primaries and the
rate at which they merge with these primaries is sensitive to the assumed value
of M_cut; in contrast, suppressing low-mass halo formation has little influence
on the angular momentum content of galaxy-mass haloes -- it is the quiescence
or violence of a halo's assembly history that has a more marked effect.
However, we expect that measuring the effect on spatial clustering or the
merger rate is likely to be observationally difficult for realistic values of
M_cut, and so isolating the effect of this small-scale structure would appear
to be remarkably difficult to detect, at least in the present day Universe.

al. (2013) using dropout techniques with the 16-band HST photometry acquired as
part of the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH). Obtained
as part of the CLASH-VLT survey, the VIMOS medium-resolution spectra of this
source show a very faint continuum between ~8700A and ~9300A and a prominent
emission line at 8643A, which can be readily identified with Lyman-alpha at
z=6.110. The emission line exhibits an asymmetric profile, with a more
pronounced red wing. The rest-frame equivalent width of the line is EW=79+-10A.
After correcting for magnification, the star-formation rate (SFR) estimated
from the Lya line is SFR(Lya)=11 M_{sol}/yr and that estimated from the UV data
is SFR(UV)=3 M_{sol}/yr. We estimate that the effective radius of the source is
R_e<~0.4 kpc, which implies a star formation surface mass density Sigma_{SFR}>6
M_{sol}/yr/kpc^2 and, using the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, a gas surface mass
density Sigma_{gas}>10^3 M_{sol}/pc^2. Our results support the idea that this
magnified, distant galaxy is a young and compact object with 0.4 L^* at z=6,
with comparable amount of mass in gas and stars. Future follow-up observations
with ALMA will provide valuable insight into the SFR and molecular gas content
of this source. In the spirit of the Frontier Fields initiative, we also
publish the redshifts of several multiply imaged sources and other background

substantial difference of the two backgrounds. In this paper, we investigate if
the detection of the ""shadow"" of nearby super-massive black hole candidates by
near future mm/sub-mm very long baseline interferometry experiments can do the
job. More specifically, we consider the measurement of the Kerr spin parameter
of the Bardeen and Hayward regular black holes from their shadow, and we then
compare the result with the estimate inferred from the K$\alpha$ iron line and
from the frequency of the innermost stable circular orbit. For non-rotating
black holes, the shadow approach provides different values, and therefore the
Kerr black hole hypothesis can potentially be tested. For near extremal
objects, all the approaches give quite similar results, and therefore it is not
possible to constrain deviations from the Kerr solution. The present work
confirms that it is definitively challenging to test this kind of metrics, even
with future facilities. However, the detection of a source that looks like a
fast-rotating Kerr black hole can put meaningful constraints on the nature of
the compact object.

is now possible to observe in disk-integrated intensity the signature of this
phenomena in a growing number of stars. The space-based photometric
measurements show that the global brightness fluctuations and the lifetime
associated with granulation obeys characteristic scaling relations. We thus aim
at providing a simple theoretical modeling to reproduce these scaling relations
and subsequently at inferring the physical properties of granulation properties
across the HR diagram.
  We develop a simple 1D theoretical model that enable us to test any
prescription concerning the time-correlation between granules. The input
parameters of the model are extracted from 3D hydrodynamical models of the
surface layers of stars, and the free parameters involved in the model are
calibrated with solar observations. Two different prescriptions for
representing the eddy time-correlation in the Fourier space are compared: a
Lorentzian and an exponential form. Finally, we compare our theoretical
prediction with a 3D radiative hydrodynamical (RHD) numerical modeling of
stellar granulation (ab-initio approach). Provided that the free parameters are
appropriately adjusted, our theoretical model satisfactorily reproduces the
shape and the amplitude of the observed solar granulation spectrum. The best
agreement is obtained with an exponential form. Furthermore, our theoretical
model results in granulation spectra that consistently agree with the these
calculated on the basis of the ab-initio approach with two 3D RHD models.
Comparison between theoretical granulation spectra calculated with the present
model and high precision photometry measurements of stellar granulation is
undertaken in a companion paper.

synchronization or quasi-synchronization of the stellar spin in some extreme
cases. However, the nature of the mechanism responsible for the tidal
dissipation in such systems remains uncertain. In this paper, we claim that the
so-called elliptical instability may play a major role in these systems,
explaining some systematic features present in the observations. This
hydrodynamic instability, arising in rotating flows with elliptical
streamlines, is suspected to be present in both planet and star of such
systems, which are elliptically deformed by tides. The presence and the
influence of the elliptical instability in gaseous bodies, such as stars or hot
Jupiters, are most of the time neglected. In this paper, using numerical
simulations and theoretical arguments, we consider several features associated
to the elliptical instability in hot-Jupiter systems. In particular, the use of
ad hoc boundary conditions makes it possible to estimate the amplitude of the
elliptical instability in gaseous bodies. We also consider the influence of
compressibility on the elliptical instability, and compare the results to the
incompressible case. We demonstrate the ability for the elliptical instability
to grow in the presence of differential rotation, with a possible synchronized
latitude, provided that the tidal deformation and/or the rotation rate of the
fluid are large enough. Moreover, the amplitude of the instability for a
centrally-condensed mass of fluid is of the same order of magnitude as for an
incompressible fluid for a given distance to the threshold of the instability.
Finally, we show that the assumption of the elliptical instability being the
main tidal dissipation process in eccentric inflated hot Jupiters and
misaligned stars is consistent with current data.

that retains its topology and many of its significant morphological properties.
The process of obtaining the skeleton, referred to as skeletonization or
thinning, is a very active research area. It plays a central role in reducing
the amount of information to be processed during image analysis and
visualization, computer-aided diagnosis or by pattern recognition algorithms.
  This paper introduces a novel topology preserving thinning algorithm which
removes \textit{simple cells}---a generalization of simple points---of a given
cell complex. The test for simple cells is based on \textit{acyclicity tables}
automatically produced in advance with homology computations. Using acyclicity
tables render the implementation of thinning algorithms straightforward.
Moreover, the fact that tables are automatically filled for all possible
configurations allows to rigorously prove the generality of the algorithm and
to obtain fool-proof implementations. The novel approach enables, for the first
time, according to our knowledge, to thin a general unstructured simplicial
complex. Acyclicity tables for cubical and simplicial complexes and an open
source implementation of the thinning algorithm are provided as additional
material to allow their immediate use in the vast number of practical
applications arising in medical imaging and beyond.

  with arXiv:1204.1234",,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we study a model describing a copolymer in a micro-emulsion.
The copolymer consists of a random concatenation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic
monomers, the micro-emulsion consists of large blocks of oil and water arranged
in a percolation-type fashion. The interaction Hamiltonian assigns energy
$-\alpha$ to hydrophobic monomers in oil and energy $-\beta$ to hydrophilic
monomers in water, where $\alpha,\beta$ are parameters that without loss of
generality are taken to lie in the cone $\{(\alpha,\beta)
\in\mathbb{R}^2\colon\,\alpha \geq |\beta|\}$. Depending on the values of these
parameters, the copolymer either stays close to the oil-water interface
(localization) or wanders off into the oil and/or the water (delocalization).
Based on an assumption about the strict concavity of the free energy of a
copolymer near a linear interface, we derive a variational formula for the
quenched free energy per monomer that is column-based, i.e., captures what the
copolymer does in columns of different type. We subsequently transform this
into a variational formula that is slope-based, i.e., captures what the polymer
does as it travels at different slopes, and we use the latter to identify the
phase diagram in the $(\alpha,\beta)$-cone. There are two regimes:
supercritical (the oil blocks percolate) and subcritical (the oil blocks do not
percolate). The supercritical and the subcritical phase diagram each have two
localized phases and two delocalized phases, separated by four critical curves
meeting at a quadruple critical point. The different phases correspond to the
different ways in which the copolymer can move through the micro-emulsion. The
analysis of the phase diagram is based on three hypotheses of percolation-type
on the blocks. We show that these three hypotheses are plausible, but do not
provide a proof.

interference effects related to the mass hierarchy (i.e., the relative sign of
Delta m^2 and delta m^2). In order to take full advantage of these

spectra are required. In such a context, we revisit several input ingredients,
including: nucleon recoil in inverse beta decay and its impact on energy
reconstruction and resolution, hierarchy and matter effects in the oscillation
probability, spread of reactor distances, irreducible backgrounds from
geoneutrinos and from far reactors, and degeneracies between energy scale and
spectrum shape uncertainties. We also introduce a continuous parameter alpha,
which interpolates smoothly between normal hierarchy (alpha=+1) and inverted
hierarchy (alpha=-1). The determination of the hierarchy is then transformed
from a test of hypothesis to a parameter estimation, with a sensitivity given
by the distance of the true case (either alpha=+1 or alpha=-1) from the
undecidable case (alpha=0). Numerical experiments are performed for the
specific set up envisaged for the JUNO project, assuming a realistic sample of
O(10^5) reactor events. We find a typical sensitivity of ~2 sigma to the
hierarchy in JUNO, which, however, can be challenged by energy scale and
spectrum shape systematics, whose possible conspiracy effects are investigated.

  to Neural Populations",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Diffusion processes have been applied with great success to model the
dynamics of large populations throughout science, in particular biology. One
advantage is that they bridge two different scales: the microscopic and the
macroscopic one. Diffusion is a mathematical idealisation, however: it assumes
vanishingly small state changes at the microscopic level. In real biological
systems this is often not the case. The differential Chapman-Kolmogorov
equation is more appropriate to model population dynamics that is not well
described by drift and diffusion alone.
  Here, the method of characteristics is used to transform deterministic
dynamics away and find a coordinate frame where this equation reduces to a
Master equation. There is no longer a drift term, and solution methods there
are insensitive to density gradients, making the method suitable for jump
processes with arbitrary jump sizes. Moreover, its solution is universal: it no
longer depends explicitly on the deterministic system.
  We demonstrate the technique on simple models of neuronal populations.
Surprisingly, it is suitable for fast neural dynamics, even though in the new
coordinate frame state space may expand rapidly towards infinity. We
demonstrate universality: the method is applicable to any one dimensional
neural model and show this on populations of leaky- and
quadratic-integrate-and-fire neurons. In the diffusive limit, excellent
approximations of Fokker-Planck equations are achieved. Nothing in the approach
is particular to neuroscience, and the neural models are simple enough to serve
as an example of dynamical systems that demonstrates the method.

for full heavy-ion collisions, which numerically solves the 3+1D Boltzmann
equation based on 2->2 as well as inelastic 2<->3 scattering processes,
together with PYTHIA initial state conditions for the parton showers. Due to
the employed test-particle approach jet reconstruction within BAMPS events is
not trivial. We introduce a method that nevertheless allows the microscopic
simulation of the full evolution of the shower particles, recoiled medium
particles, and the underlying bulk medium in one common microscopic framework.
With this method it is possible to investigate the role of the medium recoil
for the momentum imbalance A_J while using well-established background
subtraction algorithms. Due to the available particle information in
configuration as well as momentum space within BAMPS, it is additionally
possible to reproduce the entire evolution of the reconstructed jets within the

suited to graphically depict assortative and disassortative variations within
networks. To quantify degree correlation variations, the joint probability
distribution between nodes with arbitrary degrees, P(k', k), is used.
Introduction of the end-degree probability function as a basic variable allows
using group theory to derive mathematical models for P(k', k). In this form, an
expression, representing a family of seven models, is constructed with the
needed normalization conditions. Applied to \Delta(k', k), this expression
predicts a nonuniform distribution of degree correlation in networks, organized
in two assortative and two disassortative zones. This structure is actually
observed in a set of four modeled, technological, social, and biological
networks. A regression study performed on 15 actual networks shows that the

stars and wels obtained from high-resolution spectrophotometric data. Our main
aims are to determine the chemical composition of the PNe and to study the
behaviour of the abundance discrepancy problem (ADF) in this type of planetary
nebulae. The detection of a large number of optical recombination lines (ORLs)
and collisionally excited lines (CELs) from different ions were presented
previously. Most of the ORLs were reported for the first time in these PNe.
Ionic abundances were derived from the available CELs and ORLs, using
previously determined physical conditions. Based on these two sets of ionic
abundances, we derived the total chemical abundances in the nebulae using
suitable ICFs (when available). In spite of the [WC] nature of the central
stars, moderate ADF(O^++), in the range from 1.2 to 4, were found for all the
objects. We found that when the quality of the spectra is high enough the ORLs
O^++/H^+ abundance ratios obtained from different multiplets excited mainly by
recombination are very similar. Possible dependence of ADFs with some nebular
characteristics were analysed, finding no correlation. Abundances derived from
CELs were corrected by determining the t^2 parameter. O abundances for PNe,
derived from ORLs, are in general larger than the solar abundance. We derived
the C/O ratio from ORLs and N/O and alpha-element/O ratios from CELs and found
that these PNe are, in average, N-and C-richer than the average of large PN
samples. About half of our sample is C-rich (C/O>1). The alpha-elements grow in
lockstep with O abundance. Comparing the N/O and C /O ratios with those derived
from stellar evolution models, we estimate that about half of our PNe have
progenitors with initial masses > 4 M_sun. No correlation was found between the
stellar [WC]-type and the nebular abundances.

identified more than 100 potential new candidate members in the {\ss} Pic
moving group, and in the Tucana-Horologium, Columba, Carina, and Argus
associations. In order to further assess and confirm their membership status,
we analysed radial velocity data and lithium equivalent widths extracted from
high-resolution spectra of 54 candidate stars. We identified 35 new
probable/possible young moving group members: 4 in the {\ss} Pic moving group,
11 in the Columba association, 16 in the Carina association, and 4 in the Argus
association. We found serendipitiously a new AB Dor moving group member as
well. For four Columba systems Hipparcos based parallaxes have already been
available and as they are consistent with the predicted kinematic parallaxes,
they can be considered as secure new members.

B-R=1.05+/-0.18 mag and a phase function with slope beta=0.95+/-0.41 mag/deg.
The large lightcurve range implies an extremely elongated shape for 2013 SQ317,
possibly as a single elongated object but most simply explained as a compact
binary. If modelled as a compact binary near hydrostatic equilibrium, the bulk
density of 2013 SQ317 is near 2670 kg m^(-3). If 2003 SQ317 is instead a
single, elongated object, then its equilibrium density is about 860 kg m^(-3).
These density estimates become uncertain at the 30% level if we relax the
hydrostatic assumption and account for solid, ""rubble pile""-type
configurations. 2013 SQ317 has been associated with the Haumea family based on
its orbital parameters and near-infrared colour; we discuss our findings in

young (10-17 Myr) A-type star HD95086. The strong infrared excess of the system
indicates that, similarly to HR8799, {\ss} Pic, and Fomalhaut, the star harbors
a circumstellar disk. Aiming to study the structure and gas content of the
HD95086 disk, and to investigate its possible interaction with the newly
discovered planet, here we present new optical, infrared and millimeter
observations. We detected no CO emission, excluding the possibility of an
evolved gaseous primordial disk. Simple blackbody modeling of the spectral
energy distribution suggests the presence of two spatially separate dust belts
at radial distances of 6 and 64 AU. Our resolved images obtained with the
Herschel Space Observatory reveal a characteristic disk size of ~6.0x5.4 arcsec
(540x490 AU) and disk inclination of ~25 degree. Assuming the same inclination
for the planet candidate's orbit, its re-projected radial distance from the
star is 62 AU, very close to the blackbody radius of the outer cold dust ring.
The structure of the planetary system at HD95086 resembles the one around
HR8799. Both systems harbor a warm inner dust belt and a broad colder outer
disk and giant planet(s) between the two dusty regions. Modelling implies that
the candidate planet can dynamically excite the motion of planetesimals even
out to 270 AU via their secular perturbation if its orbital eccentricity is
larger than about 0.4. Our analysis adds a new example to the three known
systems where directly imaged planet(s) and debris disks co-exist.

at short distances making the coupling parameter acquire an effective
(renormalized) value that falls within the weak range 0 to 1/4. This prevents
the oscillations form growing without limit giving a lower bound to the energy
spectrum and forcing the Hamiltonian of the system to be self-adjoint.
Technically, this translates into a regularization scheme whereby the inverse

interesting solutions in F(R) gravity without matter field (pure gravity). We
investigate the geometry of the solutions and find that there is an essential
singularity at the origin. In addition, we show that there is an analogy
between obtained solutions with the black holes of Einstein-Lambda
-power-Maxwell-invariant theory. Furthermore, we find that these solutions are
equivalent to the asymptotically Lifshitz black holes. Also, we calculate
d^2F/dR^2 to examine the Dolgov-Kawasaki stability criterion.

  Development of Open Source Software Packages at the International Centre for
  Theoretical Physics (ICTP)",,,,,"cs.SE cs.MS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A large number of computational scientific research projects make use of open
source software packages. However, the development process of such tools
frequently differs from conventional software development; partly because of
the nature of research, where the problems being addressed are not always fully
understood; partly because the majority of the development is often carried out
by scientists with limited experience and exposure to best practices of
software engineering. Often the software development suffers from the pressure
to publish scientific results and that credit for software development is
limited in comparison. Fundamental components of software engineering like
modular and reusable design, validation, documentation, and software
integration as well as effective maintenance and user support tend to be
disregarded due to lack of resources and qualified specialists. Thus innovative
developments are often hindered by steep learning curves required to master
development for legacy software packages full of ad hoc solutions. The growing
complexity of research, however, requires suitable and maintainable
computational tools, resulting in a widening gap between the potential users
(often growing in number) and contributors to the development of such a
package. In this paper we share our experiences aiming to improve the situation
by training particularly young scientists, through disseminating our own
experiences at contributing to open source software packages and practicing key
components of software engineering adapted for scientists and scientific
software development. Specifically we summarize the outcome of the Workshop in
Advanced Techniques for Scientific Programming and Collaborative Development of
Open Source Software Packages run at the Abdus Salam International Centre for
Theoretical Physics in March 2013, and discuss our conclusions for future
efforts.

and \delta\ cells. It has been observed that \alpha\ and \beta\ cells generate
out-of-phase synchronization in the release of glucagon and insulin,
counter-regulatory hormones for increasing and decreasing glucose levels, while
\beta\ and \delta\ cells produce in-phase synchronization in the release of the
insulin and somatostatin. Pieces of interactions between the islet cells have
been observed for a long time, although their physiological role as a whole has
not been explored yet. We model the synchronized hormone pulses of islets with
coupled phase oscillators that incorporate the observed cellular interactions.
The integrated model shows that the interaction from \beta\ to \delta\ cells,
of which sign has controversial reports, should be positive to reproduce the
in-phase synchronization between \beta\ and \delta\ cells. The model also
suggests that \delta\ cells help the islet system flexibly respond to changes
of glucose environment.

in the Andreev bound level of a single-channel weak link between two

occupations of the Andreev level induced by absorption and emission of both
photons and phonons. We apply the theory to a recent experiment [Phys. Rev.
Lett. 106, 257003 (2011)] in which the dynamics of the trapping of
quasiparticles in the Andreev levels of superconducting atomic contacts coupled
to a Josephson junction was measured. We show that the plasma energy $h\nu_p$
of the Josephson junction defines a rather abrupt transition between a fast
relaxation regime dominated by coupling to photons and a slow relaxation regime
dominated by coupling to phonons. With realistic parameters the theory provides
a semi-quantitative description of the experimental results.

pulsation may transport angular momentum to the stellar surface until (part of)
this excess supports the disk formation/replenishment. The nearby Be star
Achernar is presently building a new disk and offers an excellent opportunity
to observe this process from relatively close-up. Spectra from various sources
and epochs are scrutinized to identify the salient stellar parameters
characterizing the disk life cycle as defined by H\alpha emission. Variable
strength of the non-radial pulsation is confirmed, but does not affect the
further results. For the first time it is demonstrated that the photospheric
line width does vary in a Be star, by as much as \Delta v sin i \lesssim
35kms^{-1}. However, contrary to assumptions in which a photospheric spin-up
accumulates during the diskless phase and then is released into the disk as it
is fed, the apparent photospheric spin-up is positively correlated with the
appearance of H\alpha line emission: The photospheric line widths and
circumstellar emission increase together, and the apparent stellar rotation
declines to the value at quiescence after the H\alpha line emission becomes
undetectable.

observed that the exponential EC decay is modulated with a period $T =

from simultaneous observations with a capacitive pick-up, employed also in the
previous experiments. The modulation amplitudes amount to $a_R = 0.107(24)$ and
$a_P = 0.134(27)$ for the 245 MHz resonator and the capacitive pick-up,
respectively. These new results corroborate for both detectors {\it exactly}
our previous findings of modulation periods near to 7s, though with {\it
distinctly smaller} amplitudes. Also the three-body $\beta^+$ decays have been
analyzed. For a supposed modulation period near to 7s we found an amplitude $a

point at weak interaction as origin of the observed 7s-modulation of the EC

Different frameworks are discussed paying a special attention to unitarized
coupled-channel approaches which incorporate heavy-quark spin symmetry. Several
charmed baryon states with negative parity are generated dynamically by the
s-wave interaction between pseudoscalar and vector meson multiplets with
$1/2^+$ and $3/2^+$ baryons. These states are compared to experimental data.
Moreover, the properties of open-charm mesons in matter are analyzed. The
in-medium solution accounts for Pauli blocking effects, and for the meson
self-energies in a self-consistent manner. The behavior in the nuclear medium
of the rich spectrum of dynamically-generated baryon states is studied as well
as their influence in the self-energy and, hence, the spectral function of open
charm. The possible experimental signatures of the in-medium properties of open
charm are finally addressed, such as the formation of charmed nuclei, in

more slowly as they approach critical transitions---a phenomenon known as
critical slowing down. If the system is stochastically forced, autocorrelation
and variance in time-series data from the system often increase before the
transition, potentially providing an early warning of coming danger. In some
cases, these statistical patterns are sufficiently strong, and occur
sufficiently far from the transition, that they can be used to predict the
distance between the current operating state and the critical point. In other
cases CSD comes too late to be a good indicator. In order to better understand
the extent to which CSD can be used as an indicator of proximity to bifurcation
in power systems, this paper derives autocorrelation functions for three small
power system models, using the stochastic differential algebraic equations
(SDAE) associated with each. The analytical results, along with numerical
results from a larger system, show that, although CSD does occur in power
systems, its signs sometimes appear only when the system is very close to
transition. On the other hand, the variance in voltage magnitudes consistently
shows up as a good early warning of voltage collapse. Finally, analytical
results illustrate the importance of nonlinearity to the occurrence of CSD.

exhibit a very minor dependence on $x$, if truncation is excepted. This
suggests that the effective exchange interaction between Mn ions is essentially

of an astronomical population of sources of which only a small subset are
observed above some limiting flux density threshold. The method is most
naturally applied to astronomical source populations at a common distance
(e.g.,stellar populations in globular clusters), and can be applied even to
populations where a survey detects no objects. The model allows for the
inclusion of physical parameters of the stellar population and the detection
process. As an example, we apply this method to the current sample of radio
pulsars in Galactic globular clusters. Using the sample of flux density limits
on pulsar surveys in 94 globular clusters published by Boyles et al., we
examine a large number of population models with different dependencies. We
find that models which include the globular cluster two-body encounter rate,
$\Gamma$, are strongly favoured over models in which this is not a factor. The
optimal model is one in which the mean number of pulsars is proportional to
$\exp(1.5 \log \Gamma)$. This model agrees well with earlier work by Hui et al.
and provides strong support to the idea that the two-body encounter rate
directly impacts the number of neutron stars in a cluster. Our model predicts
that the total number of potentially observable globular cluster pulsars in the
Boyles et al. sample is 1070$^{+1280}_{-700}$, where the uncertainties signify
the 95% confidence interval. Scaling this result to all Galactic globular
clusters, and to account for radio pulsar beaming, we estimate the total

The initial intensity front of the jet had a projected velocity of 200 km/s and
line-of-sight (LOS) velocities measured by EIS are between 100 and 250 km/s.
The LOS velocities increased along the jet, implying an acceleration mechanism
operating within the body of the jet. The jet plasma had a density of 2.7 x
10^8 cm^-3, and a temperature of 1.4 MK. During the event a number of bright
kernels were seen at the base of the bright point. The kernels have sizes of
about 1000 km, are variable in brightness, and have lifetimes of 1-15 minutes.
An XRT filter ratio yields temperatures of 1.5-3.0 MK for the kernels. The
bright point existed for at least ten hours, but disappeared within two hours
after the jet, which lasted for 30 minutes. HMI data reveal converging

relevant quantities as a function of the gas parameter: the chemical potential,
the pressure and the sound velocity. In addition, within the Feynman's

excitation spectrum, which displays a maxon-roton behavior when the gas
parameter is close to the freezing value. Finally, the equations of superfluid

Coulomb-coupled non- concentric spherical two-dimensional electron gases

on the orientation with respect to the external electromagnetic probe field.
The origin of this anisotropy of the inter-sphere Coulomb interaction is due to
the directional asymmetry of the electrostatic coupling of electrons in excited
states which depend on both the angular momentum quantum number L and its
projection M on the axis of quantization taken as the probe E-field direction.
We demonstrate the anisotropic inter-sphere Coulomb coupling in space and
present semi-analytic results in the random-phase approximation both
perpendicular and parallel to the axis of quantization. For the incidence of
light with a finite orbital or spin angular momentum, the magnetic field
generated from an induced oscillating electric dipole on one sphere can couple
to an induced magnetic dipole on another sphere in a way depending on the
direction parallel or perpendicular to the probe E field. Such an effect from
the plasmon spatial correlation is expected to be experimentally observable by
employing circularly-polarized light or a helical light beam for incidence. The
S2DEG serves as a simple model for fullerenes as well as metallic dimers, when

magnetic fields. But the detailed mechanisms which can bring the corona towards
an eruptive stage, then trigger and drive the eruption, and finally make it
explosive, are not fully understood. A large variety of storage-and-release
models have been developed and opposed to each other since 40 years. For
example, photospheric flux emergence vs. flux cancellation, localized coronal
reconnection vs. large-scale ideal instabilities and loss of equilibria,
tether-cutting vs. breakout reconnection, and so on. The competition between
all these approaches has led to a tremendous drive in developing and testing
all these concepts, by coupling state-of-the-art models and observations.
Thanks to these developments, it now becomes possible to compare all these
models with one another, and to revisit their interpretation in light of their
common and their different behaviors. This approach leads me to argue that no
more than two distinct physical mechanisms can actually initiate and drive
prominence eruptions: the magnetic breakout and the torus instability. In this
view, all other processes (including flux emergence, flux cancellation, flare
reconnection and long-range couplings) should be considered as various ways
that lead to, or that strengthen, one of the aforementioned driving mechanisms.

cosmological tidal field, using the Astrophysical Multipurpose Software
Environment. We apply this method to star clusters embedded in the CosmoGrid
dark matter-only LambdaCDM simulation. Our star clusters are born at z = 10
(corresponding to an age of the Universe of about 500 Myr) by selecting a dark
matter particle and initializing a star cluster with 32,000 stars on its
location. We then follow the dynamical evolution of the star cluster within the
cosmological environment.
  We compare the evolution of star clusters in two Milky-Way size haloes with a
different accretion history. The mass loss of the star clusters is continuous
irrespective of the tidal history of the host halo, but major merger events
tend to increase the rate of mass loss. From the selected two dark matter
haloes, the halo that experienced the larger number of mergers tends to drive a
smaller mass loss rate from the embedded star clusters, even though the final
masses of both haloes are similar. We identify two families of star clusters:
native clusters, which become part of the main halo before its final major
merger event, and the immigrant clusters, which are accreted upon or after this
event; native clusters tend to evaporate more quickly than immigrant clusters.
Accounting for the evolution of the dark matter halo causes immigrant star
clusters to retain more mass than when the z=0 tidal field is taken as a static
potential. The reason for this is the weaker tidal field experienced by
immigrant star clusters before merging with the larger dark matter halo.

the nuclei of galaxies, in the form of an accreting supermassive black hole,
and star-formation activity in these galaxies. The exact nature of this link is
still under debate. Radio jets have long been argued to be an ideal mechanism
that allows AGN to interact with their host galaxy and regulate star-formation.
In this context, we are using a sample of radio sources in the North Ecliptic
Pole (NEP) field to study the nature of the putative link between AGN activity
and star-formation. This is done by means of spectral energy distribution (SED)
fitting. We use the excellent spectral coverage of the AKARI infrared space
telescope together with the rich ancillary data available in the NEP to build
SEDs extending from UV to far-IR wavelengths. Through SED fitting we constrain
both the AGN and host galaxy components. We find a significant AGN component in
our sample of relatively faint radio-sources ($<$mJy), that increases in power
with increasing radio-luminosity. At the highest radio-luminosities, the
presence of powerful jets dominates the radio emission of these sources. A
positive correlation is found between the luminosity of the AGN component and
that of star-formation in the host galaxy, independent of the radio luminosity.
By contrast, for a given redshift and AGN luminosity, we find that increasing
radio-luminosity leads to a decrease in the specific star-formation rate. The
most radio-loud AGN are found to lie on the main sequence of star-formation for
their respective redshifts. For the first time, such a two-sided feedback
process is seen in the same sample. We conclude that radio jets do suppress
star-formation in their host galaxies but appear not to totally quench it. Our
results therefore support the maintenance nature of ""radio-mode"" feedback from
radio-AGN jets.

Lyman-alpha forest flux in the high-redshift intergalactic medium. In this type
of model a dark matter particle decays into a slightly less massive stable dark
matter daughter particle and a comparably light particle. The small mass
splitting provides a non-relativistic kick velocity V_k to the daughter
particle resulting in free-streaming and subsequent damping of small-scale
density fluctuations. Current Lyman-alpha forest power spectrum measurements
probe comoving scales up to ~ 2-3 h^-1 Mpc at redshifts z ~ 2-4, providing one
of the most robust ways to probe cosmological density fluctuations on
relatively small scales. The suppression of structure growth due to the
free-streaming of dark matter daughter particles also has a significant impact
on the neutral hydrogen cloud distribution, which traces the underlying dark
matter distribution well at high redshift. We exploit Lyman-alpha forest power
spectrum measurements to constrain the amount of free-streaming of dark matter
in such models and thereby place limits on decaying dark matter based only on
the dynamics of cosmological perturbations without any assumptions about the
interactions of the decay products. We find that SDSS 1D Lyman-alpha forest
power spectrum data place a lifetime-dependent upper limit V_k < 30-70 km/s for
decay lifetimes < 10 Gyr. This is the most stringent model-independent bound on
invisible dark matter decays with small mass splittings. For large mass
splittings (large V_k), Lyman-alpha forest data restrict the dark matter
lifetime to Gamma^-1 > 40 Gyr. Forthcoming BOSS data should be able to provide
more stringent constraints on exotic dark matter, mainly because the larger
BOSS quasar spectrum sample will significantly reduce statistical errors.

considerably less effective in disrupting their host clouds than are HII

corresponding ionization-driven bubbles. Winds are roughly as effective in
destroying the very dense gas in which the O-stars are embedded, and thus
shutting down the main regions of star-forming activity in the model clouds.
However, their influence falls off rapidly with distance from the sources, so
they are not as good at sweeping up dense gas and triggering star formation
further out in the clouds. As a result, their effect on the star formation rate
and efficiency is generally more negative than that of ionization, if they
exert any effect at all.

spherical particle suspended in an incompressible fluid is an asymptotic result
in the limit of large Schmidt number, that is, when momentum diffuses much
faster than the particle. When the Schmidt number is moderate, which happens in
most particle methods for hydrodynamics, deviations from the Stokes-Einstein
prediction are expected. We study these corrections computationally using a
recently-developed minimally-resolved method for coupling particles to an
incompressible fluctuating fluid in both two and three dimensions. We find that
for moderate Schmidt numbers the diffusion coefficient is reduced relative to
the Stokes-Einstein prediction by an amount inversely proportional to the
Schmidt number in both two and three dimensions. We find, however, that the
Einstein formula is obeyed at all Schmidt numbers, consistent with linear
response theory. The numerical data is in good agreement with an approximate
self-consistent theory, which can be used to estimate finite-Schmidt number
corrections in a variety of methods. Our results indicate that the corrections
to the Stokes-Einstein formula come primarily from the fact that the particle
itself diffuses together with the momentum. Our study separates effects coming
from corrections to no-slip hydrodynamics from those of finite separation of
time scales, allowing for a better understanding of widely observed deviations
from the Stokes-Einstein prediction in particle methods such as molecular
dynamics.

and in the information available when making the decisions. For each scenario,
we derive a tight asymptotic lower bound on the regret that has to be satisfied
by any online routing policy. These bounds help us to understand the
performance improvements we can expect when (i) taking routing decisions at
each hop rather than at the source only, and (ii) observing per-link delays
rather than end-to-end path delays. In particular, we show that (i) is of no
use while (ii) can have a spectacular impact. Three algorithms, with a
trade-off between computational complexity and performance, are proposed. The
regret upper bounds of these algorithms improve over those of the existing
algorithms, and they significantly outperform state-of-the-art algorithms in

variance of an arbitrary source by uncorrelated stars. The required inputs are
the mean convergence and shear due to the smoothed potential of the lensing
galaxy, the stellar mass function, and the absolute square of the Fourier
transform of the surface brightness in the source plane. The mathematical
approach follows previous authors but has been generalized, streamlined, and
implemented in publicly available code. Examples of its application are given
for Dexter and Agol's inhomogeneous-disk models as well as the usual gaussian
sources. Since the quantity calculated is a second moment of the magnification,
it is only logarithmically sensitive to the sizes of very compact sources.
However, for the inferred sizes of actual QSOs, it has some discriminatory
power and may lend itself to simple statistical tests. At the very least, it
should be useful for testing the convergence of microlensing simulations.

transformations of very small changes in photon frequencies from curved

red-shift result or the analogous result from a Kerr wave equation. The LCM
maps the small curvatures of the emitter galactic frame onto those of the
receiver galactic frame, and then returns the map to the associated flat frames
where measurements are made. This treatment rests upon estimates of the
luminous matter in both the emitter and receiver galaxies to determine these
small curvatures. The LCM is tested on a sample of 23 galaxies, represented in
35 different data sets. LCM fits are compared to those of the Navarro, Frenk
and White (NFW) Dark Matter Model, and/or to the Modified Newtonian Dynamics
(MOND) model when possible. The high degree of sensitivity of the LCM to the
initial assumption of a luminous mass-to-light ratio ($M_L/L$) is shown. We

two-step multiple-kernel learning approach to integrate DNA sequence motifs,
evolutionary patterns, and thousands of diverse functional genomics datasets
from a variety of cell types and developmental stages. We trained
EnhancerFinder on hundreds of experimentally verified human developmental
enhancers from the VISTA Enhancer Browser, in contrast to histone mark or
sequence-based enhancer definitions commonly used. We comprehensively evaluated
EnhancerFinder, and found that our integrative approach improves enhancer
prediction accuracy over previous approaches that consider a single type of
data. Our evaluation highlights the importance of considering information from
many tissues when predicting specific types of enhancers. We find that VISTA
enhancers active in embryonic heart are easier to predict than enhancers active
in several other tissues due to their uniquely high GC content. We applied
EnhancerFinder to the entire human genome and predicted 84,301 developmental
enhancers and their tissue specificity. These predictions provide specific
functional annotations for large amounts of human non-coding DNA, and are
significantly enriched near genes with annotated roles in their predicted
tissues and hits from genome-wide association studies. We demonstrate the
utility of our enhancer predictions by identifying and validating a novel
cranial nerve enhancer in the ZEB2 locus. Our genome-wide developmental

interatomic potential has a strongly repulsive short ranged part. We assume
that interparticle collisions via this short ranged part of the potential are
sufficient to randomize the velocities of the particles on a very small time
scale compared with the fundamental time scale defined as the particle diameter
divided by the mean thermal velocity. When this is the case, the graphical
theory suggests that both the particle current correlation functions and the
memory function of the particle density correlation function evolve on two
distinct time scales, the very short time scale just mentioned and another that
is much longer than the fundamental time scale. The diagrams that describe the
motion on each of these time scales are identified. When the two time scales
are very different, a dramatic simplification of the diagrammatic theory at
long times takes place. We identify an irreducible memory function and a more
basic function, which we call the irreducible memory kernel. This latter
function evolves on the longer time scale only and determines the time
dependence of the density and current correlation functions of interest at long
times. In the following paper, a simple one-loop approximation for the
irreducible memory kernel is used to calculate correlation functions for a
Lennard-Jones fluid at high density and a variety of temperatures.

axisymmetric radial electric field is a challenging problem requiring
substantial modifications to gyrokinetic treatments. In this thesis, I study
the effect of turbulence on the global electric field and plasma flows. By

rest-frame UV magnitude M_1700 < -20 mag, and study the dust size,
dust-to-metal mass ratio, and dust composition. From the comparison of
calculated color excess between B and V-band (i.e., E(B-V)) and the

best-fitting dust grain size is ~ 0.05 micron, which is consistent with the
results of theoretical dust models for Type-II supernova. Our simulation with
the dust extinction effect can naturally reproduce the observed rest-frame UV
luminosity function of LBGs at z=3 without assuming an ad hoc constant
extinction value. In addition, in order to reproduce the observed mean E(B-V),
we find that the dust-to-metal mass ratio needs to be similar to that of the

usually focuses on measuring the similarity between objects with the same type.
However, in many scenarios, we need to measure the relatedness between objects
with different types. With the surge of study on heterogeneous networks, the
relevance measure on objects with different types becomes increasingly
important. In this paper, we study the relevance search problem in
heterogeneous networks, where the task is to measure the relatedness of
heterogeneous objects (including objects with the same type or different
types). A novel measure HeteSim is proposed, which has the following
attributes: (1) a uniform measure: it can measure the relatedness of objects
with the same or different types in a uniform framework; (2) a path-constrained
measure: the relatedness of object pairs are defined based on the search path
that connect two objects through following a sequence of node types; (3) a
semi-metric measure: HeteSim has some good properties (e.g., self-maximum and
symmetric), that are crucial to many data mining tasks. Moreover, we analyze
the computation characteristics of HeteSim and propose the corresponding quick
computation strategies. Empirical studies show that HeteSim can effectively and
efficiently evaluate the relatedness of heterogeneous objects.

comprising piezoelectric and magnetostrictive materials as an interconnect for

plate capacitor filled with a piezoelectric, where one of the plates is made of
a magnetoelastic material. The operation of the interconnect is based on the
effect of stress-mediated anisotropy modulation, where an electric field
applied across the piezoelectric material produces stress, which, in turn,
affects the anisotropy field in the magnetostrictive material. We present the
results of numerical modeling illustrating signal propagation through the
interconnect. The model combines electric and magnetic parts, where the
electric part describes the distribution of an electric field through the
piezoelectric and the magnetic part describes the change of magnetization in
the magnetoelastic layer. The model is based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert
equation with the electric field dependent anisotropy term included. The
utilization of the electro-magnetic coupling makes it possible to amplify
magnetic signal during its propagation via energy conversion from the electric
to magnetic domains. Potentially, synthetic multiferroic interconnects can be
implemented in a variety of spin-based devices ensuring reliable and low-energy
consuming data transmission. According to the estimates, the group velocity of
magnetic signals may be up to 100 km/s with energy dissipation less than aJ per

that the region is locally too massive to withstand self-gravity since Toomre's

large brain of Homo erectus facilitated the onset of recursive recall: the
ability to string thoughts together into a stream of potentially abstract or
imaginative thought. This hypothesis is supported by a set of computational
models where an artificial society of agents evolved to generate more diverse
and valuable cultural outputs under conditions of recursive recall. We propose
that the capacity to see things in context arose much later, following the
appearance of anatomically modern humans. This second transition was brought on
by the onset of contextual focus: the capacity to shift between a minimally
contextual analytic mode of thought, and a highly contextual associative mode
of thought, conducive to combining concepts in new ways and 'breaking out of a
rut'. When contextual focus is implemented in an art-generating computer
program, the resulting artworks are seen as more creative and appealing. We
summarize how both transitions can be modeled using a theory of concepts which
highlights the manner in which different contexts can lead to modern humans

added to the standard model Higgs field, which realizes inflation compatible
with observations. Recently, it was claimed that the generalized Galileon term
induces instabilities during the oscillation phase, and that the simplest Higgs
G-inflation model inevitably suffers from this problem. In this paper, we
extend the original Higgs G-inflation Lagrangian to a more general form, namely
introducing a higher-order kinetic term and generalizing the form of the
Galileon term, so that the Higgs field can oscillate after inflation without
encountering instabilities. Moreover, it accommodates a large region of the n_s
- r plane, most of which is consistent with current observations, leading us to
expect the detection of B-mode polarization in the cosmic microwave background
in the near future.

shown that the impurity atom can induce Dicke quantum phase transition (QPT)
from the normal phase to superradiant phase at a critic value of the impurity
population. It is found that the IDDM exhibits continuous Dicke QPT with an
infinite number of critical points, which is significantly different from that
observed in the standard Dicke model with only one critical point. It is
revealed that the impurity-induced Dicke QPT can happen in an arbitrary
coupling regime of the cavity field and atoms while the Dicke QPT in the
standard Dicke model occurs only in the strong coupling regime of the cavity
field and atoms. This opens a way to observe the Dicke QPT in the intermediate
and even weak coupling regime of the cavity field and atoms.

the Galaxy, obtained with the APEX telescope. We have mapped emission in
rotational lines of HCN J = 3-2, 4-3, and 8-7, as well as HCO+ J = 3-2, 4-3,
and 9-8. We also present spectra of H13CN and H13CO+ toward four positions in
the CND. Using the intensities of all of these lines, we present an excitation
analysis for each molecule using the non-LTE radiative transfer code RADEX. The
HCN line intensities toward the northern emission peak of the CND yield log
densities (cm^-3) of 5.6 +0.6/-0.6, consistent with those measured with HCO+,
as well as with densities recently reported for this region from an excitation
analysis of highly-excited lines of CO. These densities are too low for the gas
to be tidally stable. The HCN line intensities toward the CND's southern
emission peak yield log densities of 6.5 +0.5/-0.7, higher than densities
determined for this part of the CND with CO (although the densities measured
with HCO+, log [n] = 5.6 +0.2/-0.2, are more consistent with the CO-derived
densities). We investigate whether the higher densities we infer from HCN are
affected by mid-infrared radiative excitation of this molecule through its 14
micron rovibrational transitions. We find that radiative excitation is
important for at least one clump in the CND, where we additionally detect the J
= 4-3, v2=1 vibrationally-excited transition of HCN, which is excited by dust
temperatures of > 125-150 K. If this hot dust is present elsewhere in the CND,
it could lower our inferred densities, potentially bringing the HCN-derived
densities for the Southern part of the CND into agreement with those measured
using HCO+ and CO. Additional sensitive, high-resolution submillimeter
observations, as well as mid-infrared observations, would be useful to assess
the importance of the radiative excitation of HCN in this environment.

principle coefficients are assumed to be strictly positive definite, the
mathematical model discussed in the paper belongs to the second order parabolic
equations with non-negative characteristic form, namely that there exists
degeneracy on the lateral boundaries of the domain. The uniqueness of the
solution is obtained by the contraction mapping principle. Based on the optimal
control framework, the problem is transformed into an optimization problem and
the existence of the minimizer is established. After the necessary conditions
which must be satisfied by the minimizer are deduced, the uniqueness and
stability of the minimizer are proved. By minor modification of the cost
functional and some \emph{a-priori} regularity conditions imposed on the
forward operator, the convergence of the minimizer for the noisy input data is
obtained in the paper. The results obtained in the paper are interesting and
useful, and can be extended to more general degenerate parabolic equations.

where a file is divided in to parts which are then processed by a coding
mechanism and network coding to provide large number of parts. These are stored
at various nodes with more than one part at each node. These codes can generate
whole file and can repair a failed node by contacting some out of total
existing nodes. This property ensures reliability in case of node failure and
uses clever replication. This also optimizes bandwidth usage. In a practical
scenario, the original file will be read and updated many times. With every
update, we will have to update the data stored at many nodes. Handling multiple
requests at the same time will bring a lot of complexity. Reading and writing
or multiple writing on the same data at the same time should also be prevented.

keep an adequate amount of availability at the same time. We use a voting based

tremendous progressin experimental techniques that provide access to
cell-scale, quantitative information both on theshapes of cells within tissues
and on the genes being expressed. This information suggests that
ourunderstanding of the respective contributions of gene expression and
mechanics, and of their crucialentanglement, will soon leap forward.
Biomechanics increasingly benefits from models, which assistthe design and
interpretation of experiments, point out the main ingredients and assumptions,
andultimately lead to predictions. The newly accessible local information thus
calls for a reflectionon how to select suitable classes of mechanical models.
We review both mechanical ingredientssuggested by the current knowledge of
tissue behaviour, and modelling methods that can helpgenerate a rheological
diagram or a constitutive equation. We distinguish cell scale (""intra-cell"")and
tissue scale (""inter-cell"") contributions. We recall the mathematical framework
developpedfor continuum materials and explain how to transform a constitutive
equation into a set of partialdifferential equations amenable to numerical
resolution. We show that when plastic behaviour isrelevant, the dissipation
function formalism appears appropriate to generate constitutive equations;its
variational nature facilitates numerical implementation, and we discuss
adaptations needed in thecase of large deformations. The present article
gathers theoretical methods that can readily enhancethe significance of the
data to be extracted from recent or future high throughput
biomechanicalexperiments.

images needs to be classified as belonging to the same person or not. This
problem is relatively new and not well-explored in the literature. Current
methods mostly adopt techniques borrowed from face recognition, and process
each of the images in the pair independently, which is counter intuitive. In
contrast, we propose to extract cross-image features, i.e. features across the
pair of images, which, as we demonstrate, is more discriminative to the
similarity and the dissimilarity of faces. Our features are derived from the
popular Haar-like features, however, extended to handle the face verification
problem instead of face detection. We collect a large bank of cross-image
features using filters of different sizes, locations, and orientations.
Consequently, we use AdaBoost to select and weight the most discriminative
features. We carried out extensive experiments on the proposed ideas using
three standard face verification datasets, and obtained promising results
outperforming state-of-the-art.

uniformly to a positive stationary state for any $ \sigma > \sigma^*$. In the

increase the uncertainty if the system and particle entangled initially. On the
other hand, the entanglement could be generated from nonuniform motion once the
Unruh decoherence is prevented by utilizing the cavity. We show that, in a
uncertainty game between an inertial cavity and a nonuniformly accelerated one,
the uncertainty evolves periodically with respect to the duration of

selected jammers transmit independent and identically distributed Gaussian
signals to hinder the eavesdropper (Eve). Since the channels of Bob and Eve are
independent, we can select the jammers whose jamming channels are aligned at
Bob, but not at Eve. As a result, Eve cannot obtain any DoF unless it has more
than $KN_j$ receive antennas, where $N_j$ is the number of jammer's transmit
antenna each, and hence $KN_j$ can be regarded as defensible dimensions against
Eve. For the jamming signal alignment at Bob, we propose two opportunistic

$A$-distance antimagic labelling of $G$ is a bijection from $V(G)$ to $A$ such
that the vertices of $G$ have pairwise distinct weights, where the weight of a
vertex is the sum (under the operation of $A$) of the labels assigned to its
neighbours. An {$A$-distance magic labelling} of $G$ is a bijection from $V(G)$
to $A$ such that the weights of all vertices of $G$ are equal to the same
element of $A$. In this paper we study these new labellings under a general
setting with a focus on product graphs. We prove among other things several
general results on group antimagic or magic labellings for Cartesian, direct
and strong products of graphs. As applications we obtain several families of
graphs admitting group distance antimagic or magic labellings with respect to
elementary Abelian groups, cyclic groups or direct products of such groups.

linear-optical networks to solve sampling problems that appear to be
intractable for a classical computer. In arXiv:1306.3995, Gogolin et al.
claimed that even an ideal BosonSampling device's output would be
""operationally indistinguishable"" from a uniform random outcome, at least
""without detailed a priori knowledge""; or at any rate, that telling the two
apart might itself be a hard problem. We first answer these claims---explaining
why the first is based on a definition of ""a priori knowledge"" so strange that,
were it adopted, almost no quantum algorithm could be distinguished from a pure
random-number source; while the second is neither new nor a practical obstacle
to interesting BosonSampling experiments. However, we then go further, and
address some interesting research questions inspired by Gogolin et al.'s
mistaken arguments. We prove that, with high probability over a Haar-random
matrix A, the BosonSampling distribution induced by A is far from the uniform
distribution in total variation distance. More surprisingly, and directly
counter to Gogolin et al., we give an efficient algorithm that distinguishes
these two distributions with constant bias. Finally, we offer three ""bonus""
results about BosonSampling. First, we report an observation of Fernando
Brandao: that one can efficiently sample a distribution that has large entropy
and that's indistinguishable from a BosonSampling distribution by any circuit
of fixed polynomial size. Second, we show that BosonSampling distributions can
be efficiently distinguished from uniform even with photon losses and for
general initial states. Third, we offer the simplest known proof that
FermionSampling is solvable in classical polynomial time, and we reuse
techniques from our BosonSampling analysis to characterize random
FermionSampling distributions.

turn out to be the most important channels for access to massive information in
the era of Web 2.0. The dynamics of human activity and item popularity is a
crucial issue in social media networks. In this paper, by analyzing the growth
of user activity and item popularity in four empirical social media networks,
i.e., Amazon, Flickr, Delicious and Wikipedia, it is found that cross links
between users and items are more likely to be created by active users and to be
acquired by popular items, where user activity and item popularity are measured
by the number of cross links associated with users and items. This indicates
that users generally trace popular items, overall. However, it is found that
the inactive users more severely trace popular items than the active users.
Inspired by empirical analysis, we propose an evolving model for such networks,
in which the evolution is driven only by two-step random walk. Numerical
experiments verified that the model can qualitatively reproduce the
distributions of user activity and item popularity observed in empirical
networks. These results might shed light on the understandings of micro
dynamics of activity and popularity in social media networks.

construction and the generalised construction due to Argyros and Haydon. We
show how these two constructions are related, and as a corollary, are able to
prove that there exists some $\delta > 0$ and an uncountable set of isometries
on the original Bourgain-Delbaen spaces which are pairwise distance $\delta$
apart.
  We subsequently extend these ideas to obtain our main results. We construct
new Banach spaces of Bourgain-Delbaen type, all of which have $\ell_1$ dual.
The first class of spaces are HI and possess few, but not very few operators.
We thus have a negative solution to the Argyros-Haydon question. We remark that
all these spaces have finite dimensional Calkin algebra, and we investigate the
corollaries of this result. We also construct a space with $\ell_1$ Calkin
algebra and show that whilst this space is still of Bourgain-Delbaen type with
$\ell_1$ dual, it behaves somewhat differently to the first class of spaces.
  Finally, we briefly consider shift-invariant $\ell_1$ preduals, and hint at

(3TRF)"", I generalize the three term recurrence relation in the linear
differential equation for the infinite series and polynomial which makes B_n
term terminated including all higher terms of A_n's. In this series I will show
how to obtain the formula for the polynomial which makes A_n term terminated
including all higher terms of B_n's and infinite series of its power series
expansion. In the future series I will show you for the polynomial which makes
A_n and B_n terms terminated at same time; the power series, integral formalism
and generating function such as Heun, Mathieu, Lame and GCH equations will be
constructed analytically. In chapter 1, I will generalize the three term
recurrence relation in linear differential equation in a backward for the
infinite series and polynomial which makes A_n term terminated including all
higher terms of B_n's. In chapters 2-9, I will apply reversible three term
recurrence formula to (1) the power series expansion in closed forms, (2) its
integral representation and (3) generating functions of Heun, Confluent Heun,
GCH, Lame and Mathieu equations that consist of three term recursion relation
for the infinite series and polynomial which makes A_n term terminated.

interpretation' to the `potential interpretation' of the Aharonov-Bohm effect.
Everyone agrees that the inverse image $[A]=[A+d\lambda]_{\lambda}=d^{-1}F$ of
the electromagnetic field $F$ is a class, full of individuals; and that the
circulation $\small{\textsf{C}}$ of the electromagnetic potential $A$ around a
loop $\sigma_0$ encircling the solenoid is common to the whole class $[A]$, and
to the homotopy class or \emph{hoop} $[\sigma_0]$. If picking individuals out
of classes is the problem, picking an individual potential out of $[A]$ should
be no worse than picking an individual loop out of $[\sigma_0]$. The
individuals of $[A]$ can moreover be transcended---punctually, without
integration around loops---by an appropriate version of the electromagnetic
connection.

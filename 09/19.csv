examining and assessing the Blind Variation Selective Retention (BVSR) theory
of creativity. Nonmonotonicity--e.g. as indicated by a lack of similarity of
successive sketches--is not evidence of a selectionist process; Darwin's theory
explains adaptive change, not nonmonotonicity. Although the notion of blindness
originally implied randomness, it now encompasses phenomena that bias idea
generation, e.g. the influence of remote associations on sketch ideas. However,
for a selectionist framework is to be applicable, such biases must be
negligible, otherwise evolutionary change is attributed to those biases, not to
selection. The notion of 'variants' should not be applied to creativity;
without a mechanism of inheritance, there is no basis upon which to delineate,
for example, which sketch ideas are or are not variants of a given sketch idea.
The notion of selective retention is also problematic. Selection provides an
explanation when acquired change is not transmitted; it cannot apply to
Picasso's painting (or other creative acts) because his ideas acquired
modifications as he thought them through that were incorporated into paintings
and viewed by others. The generation of one sketch affects the criteria by
which the next is judged, so sequentially generated sketches cannot be treated
as members of a generation, and selected amongst. Although BVSR is
inappropriate as a theoretical framework for creativity, exploring to what
extent selectionism explains the generation of not just biological form but
masterpieces such as Picasso's Guernica is useful for gaining insight into
creativity.

Using these wave solutions, we single out two special points of the parametric

point at which the effective mass of the wave profile which is interpreted as a
scalar mode, completely saturates the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound of the
$AdS_3$ space in which the wave is propagating. The second special point is a

investigate the possibility of asymptotically Lifshitz black solutions to be

vacua considering specific relations between the mass parameters of $R^3$-NMG.
A certain polynomial equation arises at the first special point where solutions
with logarithmic fall-off in the $AdS_3$ space appear. Solving this polynomial
equation, we obtain the values of the dynamical exponent $z$ which correspond

  In this paper, we consider the Douglas-Rachford algorithm for finding a point
in the intersection of two subspaces. We prove that the method converges
strongly to the projection of the starting point onto the intersection.
Moreover, if the sum of the two subspaces is closed, then the convergence is
linear with the rate being the cosine of the Friedrichs angle between the
subspaces. Our results improve upon existing results in three ways: First, we
identify the location of the limit and thus reveal the method as a best
approximation algorithm; second, we quantify the rate of convergence, and
third, we carry out our analysis in general (possibly infinite-dimensional)
Hilbert space. We also provide various examples as well as a comparison with
the classical method of alternating projections.

a rather large range for $h_\pi= (1.1\pm 2)\cdot 10^{-6}$. This range is

of biological species, a second evolutionary process has appeared on our
planet. It is the evolution of culture-e.g., ideas, beliefs, and artifacts.
Does culture evolve in the same genuine sense as biological life? And if so,
does it evolve through natural selection, or by some other means? Why does no
other species remotely approach the degree of cultural complexity of humans?
These questions lie at the foundation of who we are and what makes our lives
meaningful. Although much research has been done on how selective pressures
operating at the biological level affect cognition and culture, little research
has focused on culture as an evolutionary process in its own right. Like
biological forms, cultural forms-ideas, attitudes, artifacts, mannerisms,
etc.-incrementally adapt to the constraints and affordances of their
environment through descent with modification. In some respects culture appears
to be Darwinian, i.e., a process of differential replication and selection
amongst randomly generated variants. This suggests that knowledge of biological
evolution can be put to use to gain insight into culture. However, attempts to
apply Darwinian theory to culture have not yielded the kind of unifying
framework for the social sciences that it provided for the biological sciences,
largely because of the nonrandom manner in which the mind-the hub of cultural
change-generates and assimilates novelty. This paper investigates how and when
humans became capable of supporting culture, and what previously held it back,
focusing on how we attained the creative powers we now possess. To invent in
the strategic, intuitive manner characteristic of humans requires a cognitive
architecture that supports the capacity to spontaneously adapt concepts to new
circumstances and merge them together to conceptualize new situations.

human decision making, combining state-of-the-art RL algorithms with an
application to prosthetics. Managing human-machine interaction is a problem of
considerable scope, and the simplification of human-robot interfaces is
especially important in the domains of biomedical technology and rehabilitation
medicine. For example, amputees who control artificial limbs are often required
to quickly switch between a number of control actions or modes of operation in
order to operate their devices. We suggest that by learning to anticipate
(predict) a user's behaviour, artificial limbs could take on an active role in
a human's control decisions so as to reduce the burden on their users.
Recently, we showed that RL in the form of general value functions (GVFs) could
be used to accurately detect a user's control intent prior to their explicit
control choices. In the present work, we explore the use of temporal-difference
learning and GVFs to predict when users will switch their control influence
between the different motor functions of a robot arm. Experiments were
performed using a multi-function robot arm that was controlled by muscle
signals from a user's body (similar to conventional artificial limb control).
Our approach was able to acquire and maintain forecasts about a user's
switching decisions in real time. It also provides an intuitive and reward-free
way for users to correct or reinforce the decisions made by the machine
learning system. We expect that when a system is certain enough about its
predictions, it can begin to take over switching decisions from the user to
streamline control and potentially decrease the time and effort needed to
complete tasks. This preliminary study therefore suggests a way to naturally
integrate human- and machine-based decision making systems.

the critical magnetic field, B_c, at which the spontaneous chiral symmetry
breaking happens. Both of these growths are even more when the magnetic field

in the high temperature limit where the temperature is kept fixed. However,

at the genomic level. For instance, the phylotypic stage expresses the oldest
and most conserved transcriptomes. However, the regulatory mechanism that
causes the hourglass pattern remains an open question. Here, we use an
evolutionary model of regulatory gene interactions during development to
identify the conditions under which the hourglass effect can emerge in a
general setting. The model focuses on the hierarchical gene regulatory network
that controls the developmental process, and on the evolution of a population
under random perturbations in the structure of that network. The model
predicts, under fairly general assumptions, the emergence of an hourglass
pattern in the structure of a temporal representation of the underlying gene
regulatory network. The evolutionary age of the corresponding genes also
follows an hourglass pattern, with the oldest genes concentrated at the
hourglass waist. The key behind the hourglass effect is that developmental
regulators should have an increasingly specific function as development
progresses. Analysis of developmental gene expression profiles from Drosophila
melanogaster and Arabidopsis thaliana provide consistent results with our
theoretical predictions.

structure parameter $C_n^2$ over large areas in the atmospheric surface layer.
Turbulent fluxes of heat and momentum are inferred through coupled sets of
equations derived from the Monin--Obukhov similarity hypothesis.
One-dimensional sensitivity functions have been produced that relate the
sensitivity of heat fluxes to uncertainties in single values of beam height
over flat terrain. However, real field sites include variable topography. We
develop here, using functional derivatives, the first analysis of the
sensitivity of scintillometer-derived sensible heat fluxes to uncertainties in
spatially distributed topographic measurements. Sensitivity is shown to be
concentrated in areas near the center of the beam path and where the underlying
topography is closest to the beam height. Relative uncertainty contributions to
the sensible heat flux from uncertainties in topography can reach 20\,\% of the
heat flux in some cases. Uncertainty may be greatly reduced by focusing
accurate topographic measurements in these specific areas. A~new
two-dimensional variable terrain sensitivity function is developed for
quantitative error analysis. This function is compared with the previous
one-dimensional sensitivity function for the same measurement strategy over
flat terrain. Additionally, a~new method of solution to the set of coupled
equations is produced that eliminates computational error.

closed timelike curves (CTCs) in the quantum information literature, for both
the Deutsch model of CTC interactions (D-CTCs) and the projective model
(P-CTCs). As a consequence, there is a prima facie argument exploiting
entanglement that CTC interactions would enable superluminal and, indeed,
effectively instantaneous signaling. In cases of spacelike separation between
the sender of a signal and the receiver, whether a receiver measures the local
part of an entangled state or a disentangled state to access the signal can
depend on the reference frame. We propose a consistency condition that gives
priority to either an entangled perspective or a disentangled perspective in
spacelike separated scenarios. For D-CTC interactions, the consistency
condition gives priority to frames of reference in which the state is
disentangled, while for P-CTC interactions the condition selects the entangled
state. Using the consistency condition, we show that there is a procedure that
allows Alice to signal to Bob in the past via relayed superluminal
communications between spacelike separated Alice and Clio, and spacelike
separated Clio and Bob. This opens the door to time travel paradoxes in the
classical domain. Ralph (arXiv:1107.4675) first pointed this out for P-CTCs,
but we show that Ralph's procedure for a 'radio to the past' is flawed. Since
both D-CTCs and P-CTCs allow classical information to be sent around a
spacetime loop, it follows from a result by Aaronson and Watrous
(Proc.Roy.Soc.A, 465:631-647 (2009)) for CTC-enhanced classical computation
that a quantum computer with access to P-CTCs would have the power of PSPACE,
equivalent to a D-CTC-enhanced quantum computer.

matter in high energy processes, they encounter difficulties when applied to
low-energy nuclear structure and reactions, and dense systems. Expected
increases in computational resources into the exa-scale during the next decade
will provide the ability to numerically compute a range of important strong

the technique of Lattice QCD. These calculations will refine the chiral nuclear
forces that are used as input into nuclear many-body calculations, including

interpretation. In this heterodox interpretation, the position of a quantum
particle exists and is piloted by the phase of the wave function. We show how
this position explains determinism and realism in the three most important
experiments of quantum measurement: double-slit, Stern-Gerlach and EPR-B.
First, we demonstrate the conditions in which the de Broglie-Bohm
interpretation can be assumed to be valid through continuity with classical
mechanics. Second, we present a numerical simulation of the double-slit
experiment performed by J\""onsson in 1961 with electrons. It demonstrates the
continuity between classical mechanics and quantum mechanics: evolution of the
probability density at various distances and convergence of the quantum
trajectories to the classical trajectories when h tends to 0. Third, we present
an analytic expression of the wave function in the Stern-Gerlach experiment.
This explicit solution requires the calculation of a Pauli spinor with a
spatial extension. This solution enables to demonstrate the decoherence of the
wave function and the three postulates of quantum measurement: quantization,
the Born interpretation and wave function reduction. The spinor spatial
extension also enables the introduction of the de Broglie-Bohm trajectories,
which gives a very simple explanation of the particles' impact and of the
measurement process. Finally, we study the EPR-B experiment, the Bohm version
of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiment. Its theoretical resolution in space
and time shows that a causal interpretation exists where each atom has a
position and a spin. This interpretation avoids the flaw of the previous causal
interpretation. We recall that a physical explanation of non-local influences
is possible.

significant short words, often containing cysteine, histidine or proline.
Typically, the significance of these words is independent of growth
temperature. In a novel approach, first-passage distributions are used to
capture correlations between discontiguous residues. We find a nearly universal

the superconductor-to-insulator transition takes place at a finite critical
disorder (on the order of V_c ~ 2t), where V is the typical width of the
distribution of random site energies and t is the hopping scale. In this
article we compare the localization/delocalization properties of one and two
particles. Whereas the metal-insulator transition is a consequence of
single-particle Anderson localization, the superconductor-insulator transition
(SIT) is due to pair localization - or, alternatively, fluctuations of the
phase conjugate to pair density. The central question we address is how
superconductivity emerges from localized single-particle states. We address
this question using inhomogeneous mean field theory and quantum Monte Carlo
techniques and make several testable predictions for local spectroscopic probes
across the SIT. We show that with increasing disorder, the system forms
superconducting blobs on the scale of the coherence length embedded in an
insulating matrix. In the superconducting state, the phases on the different
blobs are coherent across the system whereas in the insulator long-range phase
coherence is disrupted by quantum fluctuations. As a consequence of this
emergent granularity, we show that the single-particle energy gap in the
density of states survives across the transition, but coherence peaks exist
only in the superconductor. A characteristic pseudogap persists above the
critical disorder and critical temperature, in contrast to conventional
theories. Surprisingly, the insulator has a two-particle gap scale that
vanishes at the SIT despite a robust single-particle gap.

non-linear regime, 1 Mpc^{-1} < k < 10^2-10^3 Mpc^{-1} up to redshift of about
unity. By using the lensing dispersion and conservative estimates in this

telescopes, has greatly improved our knowledge of blazars, namely Flat Spectrum
Radio Quasars and BL Lac objects, since all but the most powerful emit most of
their electro-magnetic output at gamma-ray energies, while the very powerful
blazars emit mostly in the hard X-ray region of the spectrum. Often they show
coordinated variability at different frequencies, suggesting that in these
cases the same population of electrons is at work, in a single zone of the jet.
The location of this region along the jet is a matter of debate. The jet power
correlates with the mass accretion rate, with jets existing at all values of
disk luminosities, measured in Eddington units, sampled so far. The most
powerful blazars show clear evidence of the emission from their disks, and this
has revived methods of finding the black hole mass and accretion rate by
modelling a disk spectrum to the data. Being so luminous, blazars can be
detected also at very high redshift, and therefore are a useful tool to explore
the far universe. One interesting line of research concerns how heavy are their
black holes at high redshifts. If we associate the presence of a relativistic
jet with a fastly spinning black hole, then we naively expect that the
accretion efficiency is larger than for non-spinning holes. As a consequence,
the black hole mass in jetted systems should grow at a slower rate. In turn,
this would imply that, at high redshifts, the heaviest black holes should be in
radio-quiet quasars. We instead have evidences of the opposite, challenging our
simple ideas of how a black hole grows.

astrochemical reaction networks, both in the solid state and in the gas phase.
Measurements of the wavelength-dependent photodesorption rates of these two
infrared-inactive molecules provide astronomical and physical-chemical insights
into the conditions required for their photodesorption. Tunable radiation from
the DESIRS beamline at the SOLEIL synchrotron in the astrophysically relevant 7

Photodesorption of molecules is monitored through quadrupole mass spectrometry.
Absolute rates are calculated by using the well-calibrated CO photodesorption
rates. Strategic N2 and O2 isotopolog mixtures are used to investigate the
importance of dissociation upon irradiation. N2 photodesorption mainly occurs
through excitation of the b^1Pi_u state and subsequent desorption of surface
molecules. The observed vibronic structure in the N2 photodesorption spectrum,
together with the absence of N3 formation, supports that the photodesorption
mechanism of N2 is similar to CO, i.e., an indirect DIET (Desorption Induced by
Electronic Transition) process without dissociation of the desorbing molecule.
In contrast, O2 photodesorption in the 7 - 13.6 eV range occurs through
dissociation and presents no vibrational structure. Photodesorption rates of N2
and O2 integrated over the far-UV field from various star-forming environments
are lower than for CO. Rates vary between 10E-3 and 10E-2 photodesorbed
molecules per incoming photon.

providing a redshift and emission line luminosity to establish the relation
between star formation rate and stellar mass. With further $J$-band
spectroscopy for 89 of these, the level of dust extinction is assessed by
measuring the Balmer decrement using co-added spectra. We find that the
extinction ($0.6\lesssim A_\mathrm{H\alpha} \lesssim 2.5$) rises with stellar
mass and is elevated at high masses compared to low-redshift galaxies. Using
this subset of the spectroscopic sample, we further find that the differential
extinction between stellar and nebular emission

we assumed that the mother is unpolarized and has a generic boost distribution
in the laboratory frame. In this work we discuss how this observation can be
applied for determination of masses of new particles, without requiring a full

measurements of the peaks of energy distributions of a and b with that of the

principle possible to determine separately all three masses of the new
particles, in particular, without using any measurement of missing transverse
momentum. Furthermore, we show how the use of the peaks in an inclusive energy
distribution is generically less affected by combinatorial issues as compared
to other mass measurement strategies. For some simplified, yet interesting,
scenarios we find that these combinatorial issues are absent altogether. As an
example of this general strategy, we study SUSY models where gluino decays to
an invisible lightest neutralino via an on-shell bottom squark. Taking into

remains unresolved, with some evidence suggesting that the inner accretion disc
is truncated and replaced by a hot flow. However, the detection of relativistic
broadened Fe emission lines, even at relatively low luminosities, seems to
require an accretion disc extending fully to its innermost stable circular
orbit. Modelling such features is however highly susceptible to degeneracies,
which could easily bias any interpretation. We present the first systematic
study of the Fe line region to track how the inner accretion disc evolves in
the low/hard state of the black hole GX 339$-$4. Our four observations display
increased broadening of the Fe line over two magnitudes in luminosity, which we
use to track any variation of the disc inner radius. We find that the disc
extends closer to the black hole at higher luminosities, but is consistent with
being truncated throughout the entire low/hard state, a result which renders
black hole spin estimates inaccurate at these stages of the outburst.
Furthermore, we show that the evolution of our spectral inner disc radius
estimates corresponds very closely to the trend of the break frequency in
Fourier power spectra, supporting the interpretation of a truncated and
evolving disc in the hard state.

been one of the foremost concerns in modern cosmology as it provides valuable
information on the cosmology of the universe. However, an accurate estimation
of the CMB power spectrum faces many challenges as the CMB experiments
sensitivity increases. Furthermore, for polarization experiments the precision
of measurement is complicated by the fact that the polarisation signal is very
faint compared to the measured total intensity, and could be impossible to
detect in the presence of high level of systematics. One of the most important
source of errors in CMB polarization experiment is the beam asymmetry. For
large data set the estimation of the CMB polarization power spectrum with
standard optimal Maximum Likelihood (ML) is prohibitive for high resolution CMB
experiments due to the enormous required computation time. In this paper, we
present a semi-analytical framework using the pseudo-$C_{l}$ estimator to
compute the power spectrum TE of the temperature anisotropy and the E-component
of the polarization radiation field using non-circular beams. We adopt a model
of beams obtained from a perturbative expansion of the beam around a circular
(axisymmetric) one in harmonic space, and compute the resulting bias matrix
which relates the true power spectrum with the observed one using an efficient
algorithm for rapid computation. We show that for a multipole up to
$l_{max}=500$, the bias matrix can be computed in less than one second with a
single CPU processor at 2.53 GHz. We find that the uncertainties induced by the
beam asymmetry in the polarization power spectrum at the peak of the bias
matrix for WMAP and Planck experiments can be as large as a few 10 to 20%

the repeated formations and partial eruptions of kink unstable flux ropes as a
result of continued emergence of a twisted flux rope across the lower boundary
into a pre-existing coronal potential arcade field. The simulation shows that a
CME erupting into the open magnetic field created by a preceding CME has a
higher speed. The second of the three successive CMEs simulated is
cannibalistic catching up and merging with the first into a single fast CME
before exiting the domain. All the CMEs including the leading merged CME,
attained speeds of about 1000 km/s as they exit the domain. The reformation of
a twisted flux rope after each CME eruption during the sustained flux emergence

from the origami-like folding of an initially flat three-dimensional manifold
in 6D phase space. The ORIGAMI method identifies these structures in a
cosmological simulation, delineating the structures according to their outer
folds. Structure identification is a crucial step in comparing cosmological
simulations to observed maps of the Universe. The ORIGAMI definition is
objective, dynamical and geometric: filament, wall and void particles are
classified according to the number of orthogonal axes along which dark-matter
streams have crossed. Here, we briefly review these ideas, and speculate on how
ORIGAMI might be useful to find cosmic voids.

detected in Spitzer/IRS high-res spectra of 202 local LIRGs observed as part of
the GOALS project. We detect emission lines of [SIV], [NeII], [NeV], [NeIII],
[SIII]18.7, [OIV], [FeII], [SIII]33.5, and [SiII]. Over 75% of our galaxies are
classified as starburst (SB) sources in the MIR. We compare ratios of the
emission line fluxes to stellar photo- and shock-ionization models to constrain
the gas properties in the SB nuclei. Comparing the [SIV]/[NeII] and
[NeIII]/[NeII] ratios to the Starburst99-Mappings III models with an
instantaneous burst history, the line ratios suggest that the SB in our LIRGs
have ages of 1-4.5Myr, metallicities of 1-2Z_sun, and ionization parameters of
2-8e7cm/s. Based on the [SIII]/[SIII] ratios, the electron density in LIRG
nuclei has a median electron density of ~300cm-3 for sources above the low
density limit. We also find that strong shocks are likely present in 10 SB
sources. A significant fraction of the GOALS sources have resolved neon lines
and 5 show velocity differences of >200km/s in [NeIII] or [NeV] relative to
[NeII]. Furthermore, 6 SB and 5 AGN LIRGs show a trend of increasing line width
with ionization potential, suggesting the possibility of a compact energy
source and stratified ISM in their nuclei. We confirm a strong correlation
between the [NeII]+[NeIII] emission, as well as [SIII]33.5, with both the IR
luminosity and the 24um warm dust emission measured from the spectra. Finally,
we find no correlation between the hardness of the radiation field or the line
width and the ratio of the total IR to 8um emission (IR8). This may be because
the IR luminosity and the MIR fine-structure lines are sensitive to different
timescales over the SB, or that IR8 is more sensitive to the geometry of the
warm dust region than the radiation field producing the HII region emission.

The continuous system drive induces decoherence through the phase interruptions

and an increase of the frequency of oscillation. We report recent experiments
that implement a simple feedback mechanism to protect the quantum beat. We
continuously drive the system until a photon is detected, heralding the

the beats. The amplitude can increase by more than fifty percent, while the
frequency is unchanged by the feedback.

Bayesian approach that explicitly captures the community behavior via prior
specification. We further adopt a data augmentation strategy with latent
Polya-Gamma variables to obtain posterior samples. We conduct inference based
on a principled, canonically mapped centroid estimator that formally addresses
label non-identifiability and captures representative community assignments. We
demonstrate the proposed model and estimation on real-world as well as

investigating only the dynamics at intermediate times is sufficient to predict
the order of magnitude of the long-time diffusion coefficient and the timescale

For the structural properties, we find that PBEsol and WC are the closest to

actually improve over LDA and PBE in contrast with HTBS, which is shown to fail
dramatically for $\alpha$-quartz. For the vibrational and thermodynamical

cases, it outperforms PBE significantly and also the WC, PBEsol and AM05
functionals though by a smaller margin (and to the detriment of structural
parameters). On the other hand, HTBS performs also poorly for vibrational
quantities. For the dielectric properties, none of the functionals can be put
forward. They all (i) fail to reproduce the electronic dielectric constant due
to the well-known band gap problem and (ii) tend to overestimate the oscillator
strengths (and hence the static dielectric constant).

$\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ operations, it is fast even for large values of $n$. Our

interpreted within the scenario of the spin-state crossover from a
room-temperature mixture of the intermediate spin Co$^{3+}$ and low spin
Co$^{4+}$ (IS/LS) at the to the LS/LS mixture in the sample ground states. In
contrast to the yttrium free $y=0$ that retains the metallic-like character and
exhibits ferromagnetic ordering below 55 K, the doped system $y=0.15$ undergoes
a first-order metal-insulator transition at 132 K, during which not only the
crossover to low spin states but also a partial electron transfer from
Pr$^{3+}$ 4f to cobalt 3d states take place simultaneously. Taking into account
the non-magnetic character of LS Co$^{3+}$, such valence shift electronic
transition causes a magnetic dilution, formally to 0.12 LS Co$^{4+}$ or 0.12
$t_{2g}$ hole spins per f.u., which is the reason for an insulating, highly
non-uniform magnetic ground state without long-range order. Nevertheless, even
in that case there exists a relatively strong molecular field distributed over
all the crystal lattice. It is argued that the spontaneous FM order in $y=0$
and the existence of strong FM correlations in $y=0.15$ apparently contradict
the single $t_{2g}$ band character of LS/LS phase. The explanation we suggest
relies on a model of the defect induced, itinerant hole mediated magnetism,
where the defects are identified with the magnetic high-spin Co$^{3+}$ species
stabilized near oxygen vacancies.

bright end by coincidence loss, the superposition of multiple photons in the
individual frames recorded by the CCD. Photons which arrive during the brief
period in which the image frame is transferred for read out of the CCD are
displaced in the transfer direction in the recorded images. For sufficiently
bright sources, these displaced counts form read-out streaks. Using UVOT
observations of Tycho-2 stars, we investigate the use of these read-out streaks
to obtain photometry for sources which are too bright (and hence have too much
coincidence loss) for normal aperture photometry to be reliable. For
read-out-streak photometry, the bright-source limiting factor is coincidence
loss within the MCPs rather than the CCD. We find that photometric measurements
can be obtained for stars up to 2.4 magnitudes brighter than the usual
full-frame coincidence-loss limit by using the read-out streaks. The resulting
bright-limit Vega magnitudes in the UVOT passbands are UVW2=8.80, UVM2=8.27,
UVW1=8.86, u=9.76, b=10.53, v=9.31 and White=11.71; these limits are
independent of the windowing mode of the camera. We find that a photometric

signals, presumed to be a signature of cataclysmic events of extragalactic

radio telescope suggests that FRBs may occur at a high rate across the sky. The
Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) operates at low radio frequencies (80-300 MHz)
and is expected to detect FRBs due to its large collecting area (~2500 m^2) and
wide field-of-view (FOV, ~1000 square degrees at nu=200 MHz). We compute the
expected number of FRB detections for the MWA assuming a source population
consistent with the reported detections. Our formalism properly accounts for
the frequency-dependence of the antenna primary beam, the MWA system
temperature, and unknown spectral index of the source population, for three
modes of FRB detection: coherent; incoherent; and fast imaging. We find that
the MWA's sensitivity and large FOV combine to provide the expectation of
multiple detectable events per week in all modes, potentially making it an
excellent high time resolution science instrument. Deviations of the expected
number of detections from actual results will provide a strong constraint on
the assumptions made for the underlying source population and intervening
plasma distribution.

segregated domains across an asymmetric bilayer are strongly correlated with
each other and whether phase segregation in one leaflet can induce segregation
in the other. We answer both these questions in the affirmative, using an
atomistic molecular dynamics simulation to study the equilibrium statistical
properties of a 3-component {\em asymmetric} lipid bilayer comprising an
unsaturated POPC (palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidyl-choline), a saturated SM
(sphingomyelin) and cholesterol with different composition ratios. Our
simulations are done by fixing the composition of the upper leaflet to be at
the coexistence of the liquid ordered ($l_o$) - liquid disordered ($l_d$)
phases, while the composition of the lower leaflet is varied from the phase
coexistence regime to the mixed $l_d$ phase, across a first-order phase
boundary. In the regime of phase coexistence in each leaflet, we find strong
transbilayer correlations of the $l_o$ domains across the two leaflets,
resulting in {\it bilayer registry}. This transbilayer correlation depends
sensitively upon the chain length of the participating lipids and possibly
other features of lipid chemistry, such as degree of saturation. We find that
the $l_o$ domains in the upper leaflet can {\em induce} phase segregation in
the lower leaflet, when the latter is nominally in the mixed ($l_d$) phase.

Remarkably, $U(\zeta^2)$ has a unique form of a harmonic oscillator potential

thus obtains an effective light-front effective theory for general spin which

that a power-law distribution can be created through averaging an exponential

suggest a Euclidean dimension. Second, special power-law distributions can be
derived from exponential distributions, but they differ from the typical

this paper, I will present a new interpretation of the scaling exponent of
rank-size distributions. The ideas from fractal measure relation and the
principle of dimension consistency are employed to explore the essence of
Pareto's and Zipf's scaling exponents. The Pareto exponent proved to be a ratio
of the fractal dimension of a network of cities to the average dimension of
city population. Accordingly, the Zipf exponent is the reciprocal of this
dimension ratio. On a digital map, the Pareto exponent can be defined by the
scaling relation between a map scale and the corresponding number of cities
based on this scale. The cities of the United States of America in 1900, 1940,
1960, and 1980 and Indian cities in 1981, 1991, and 2001 are utilized to
illustrate the geographical spatial meaning of Pareto's exponent. The results
suggest that the Pareto exponent of city-size distribution is not a fractal
dimension, but a ratio of the urban network dimension to the city population
dimension. This conclusion is revealing for scientists to understand Zipf's law

functions are frustrated by the impact of bias, which generally is not
estimated consistently when using the bootstrap and conventionally smoothed

undersmooth, so as to reduce the impact of bias, or oversmooth, and thereby
introduce an explicit or implicit bias estimator. However, these approaches,
and others based on nonstandard smoothing methods, complicate the process of
inference, for example, by requiring the choice of new, unconventional
smoothing parameters and, in the case of undersmoothing, producing relatively
wide bands. In this paper we suggest a new approach, which exploits to our
advantage one of the difficulties that, in the past, has prevented an
attractive solution to the problem - the fact that the standard bootstrap bias
estimator suffers from relatively high-frequency stochastic error. The high
frequency, together with a technique based on quantiles, can be exploited to
dampen down the stochastic error term, leading to relatively narrow,
simple-to-construct confidence bands.

restrictive condition than sub-stream fairness, fairness between all streams of
each user. Thus sub-stream fairness alleviates utility loss as well as
complexity and overhead compared to stream fairness. Moreover, depending on
algorithmic parameters, conventional algorithms including distributed
interference alignment (DIA) may not provide sub-stream fairness, and generate
sub-streams with poor signal-to-interference plus noise ratios (SINRs), thus
with poor bit error rates (BERs). To this end, we propose a distributed power
control algorithm to render sub-stream fairness in the system, and establish
initiatory connections between sub-stream SINRs, BERs, and rates. Algorithms
have particular responses to parameters. In the paper, important algorithmic
parameters are analyzed to exhibit numerical correctness in benchmarking. The
distinction between separate filtering schemes that design each stream of a
user separately and group filtering schemes that jointly design the streams of
a user is also underscored in the paper. Finally, the power control law used in
the proposed algorithm is proven to linearly converge to a unique fixed-point,
and the algorithm is shown to achieve feasible SINR targets.

relativistic field theories. In an O(N) $\varphi^4$ theory in spatial dimension
$d\le 3$, a relaxation constant $\Gamma$ of a two-point function in an infrared
region is shown to be finite within the two-particle irreducible (2PI)
framework at the next-leading order (NLO) of 1/N expansion. This immediately
implies that a slow dissipative mode with a dispersion $p_0\sim i\Gamma \p^2$
is microscopically identified in the two-point function. Contrary, NLO
calculation in the one-particle irreducible (1PI) framework fails to yield a
finite relaxation constant. Comparing the results in 1PI and 2PI frameworks,
one concludes that dissipation emerges from multiple scattering of a particle
with a heat bath, which is appropriately treated in the 2PI-NLO calculation
through the resummation of secular terms to improve long-time behavior of the
two-point function. Assuming that this slow dissipative mode survives at the
critical point, one can identify the dynamic critical exponent $z$ for the
two-point function as $z=2-\eta$. We also discuss possible improvement of the
result.

occurrence of disease can generally be ascribed to certain loss of force

neglected, while the currently available cancer prevention and treatment
methods are generally either expensive or just cause too much side effect. In
this article, we present a systematic interpretation on a promising strategy
which was termed here as Mechanical Therapy for the first time based on the
fact that mechanical force closely accompanies the whole life (growth and
death) of a cell, and plays a crucial role in biological functions. In order to
mold the mechanical force as a practical tool for cancer therapy, we expound
the effects of the mechanical force related to the tumors from molecule to
tissue level and evaluate its feasibility for treatment purpose. It can be
conceived that given enough investigations, the mechanical therapy may generate
big potential to open new windows for cancer prevention, relieving or even
destroying if well administrated. As an easy going and convenient method, a
systematic and thorough study of mechanical therapy may clarify more options
for future clinical practices. Besides, when patients encounter various forces

turbulence. We conjecture that their kinematic arguments break down in
quasi-laminar 2D flows. We find some support for these ideas by using an
Eulerian coherent structure identification technique, which allows us to
determine the effect of flow topology on the enstrophy cascade. A key finding
is that ""centers"" are inefficient at transferring enstrophy between scales, in

self-regulation via the injection of supernova-driven turbulence. A system of
equations describing star formation, black hole accretion and angular momentum
transport was solved for an axisymmetric disk in which the gravitational
potential includes contributions from the black hole, the disk and the hosting
galaxy. Our model extends the framework provided by Kawakatu et al. (2008) by
separately considering the inner and outer part of the disk, and by introducing
a potentially non-linear dependence of the star formation rate on the gas
surface density and the turbulent velocity. The star formation recipes are
calibrated using observational data for NGC 1097, while the accretion model is
based on turbulent viscosity as a source of angular momentum transport in a
thin viscous accretion disk. We find that current data provide no strong
constraint on the star formation recipe, and can in particular not distinguish
between models entirely regulated by the surface density, and models including
a dependence on the turbulent velocity. The evolution of the black hole mass,
on the other hand, strongly depends on the applied star formation law, as well
as the mass supply from the host galaxy. We suggest to explore the star
formation process in local AGN with high-resolution ALMA observations to break

distribution, and suggest that inconsistences between distributions derived by
different methods for samples with different average ages can uncover field
decay or/and emerging field. We describe a new method to probe the magnetic
field decay in normal pulsars. The method is a modified pulsar current
approach, where we study pulsar flow along the line of increasing
characteristic age for constant field. Our calculations, performed with this
method, can be fitted with an exponential decay for ages in the range $8\times
10^4$--$3.5 \times 10^5$ yrs with a time scale $\sim 5 \times 10^5$ yrs. We
discuss several issues related to the unifying scenario. At first, we note that
the dichotomy, among local thermally emitting neutron stars, between normal
pulsars and the Magnificent Seven remains unexplained. Then we discuss the role
of high-mass X-ray binaries in the unification of neutron star evolution. We
note, that such systems allow to check evolutionary effects on a time scale
longer than what can be probed with normal pulsars alone. We conclude with a
brief discussion of importance of discovering old neutron stars accreting from
the interstellar medium.

switches, called the $k$-frame throughput maximization problem ($k$-FTM). This
problem models the situation where a large frame is fragmented into $k$ packets
and transmitted through the Internet, and the receiver can reconstruct the
frame only if he/she accepts all the $k$ packets. Kesselman et al.\ introduced
this problem and showed that its competitive ratio is unbounded even when
$k=2$. They also introduced an ""order-respecting"" variant of $k$-FTM, called
$k$-OFTM, where inputs are restricted in some natural way. They proposed an
online algorithm and showed that its competitive ratio is at most
$\frac{2kB}{\lfloor B/k \rfloor} + k$ for any $B \ge k$, where $B$ is the size
of the buffer. They also gave a lower bound of $\frac{B}{\lfloor 2B/k \rfloor}$
for deterministic online algorithms when $2B \geq k$ and $k$ is a power of 2.
In this paper, we improve upper and lower bounds on the competitive ratio of
$k$-OFTM. Our main result is to improve an upper bound of $O(k^{2})$ by
Kesselman et al.\ to $\frac{5B + \lfloor B/k \rfloor - 4}{\lfloor B/2k \rfloor}
= O(k)$ for $B\geq 2k$. Note that this upper bound is tight up to a
multiplicative constant factor since the lower bound given by Kesselman et al.\
is $\Omega(k)$. We also give two lower bounds. First we give a lower bound of
$\frac{2B}{\lfloor {B/(k-1)} \rfloor} + 1$ on the competitive ratio of
deterministic online algorithms for any $k \geq 2$ and any $B \geq k-1$, which
improves the previous lower bound of $\frac{B}{\lfloor 2B/k \rfloor}$ by a
factor of almost four. Next, we present the first nontrivial lower bound on the
competitive ratio of randomized algorithms. Specifically, we give a lower bound
of $k-1$ against an oblivious adversary for any $k \geq 3$ and any $B$.

At these scales,
the Universe is filled with inhomogeneously distributed discrete structures
(galaxies, groups and clusters of galaxies), which perturb the background
Friedmann model. Here, the mechanical approach (Eingorn & Zhuk, 2012) is the
most appropriate to describe the dynamics of the inhomogeneities which is
defined, on the one hand, by gravitational potentials of inhomogeneities and,
on the other hand, by the cosmological expansion of the Universe. In this
paper, we present additional arguments in favor of this approach. First, we
estimate the size of the cell of uniformity. With the help of the standard
methods of statistical physics and for the galaxies of the type of the Milky
Way and Andromeda, we get that it is of the order of 190 Mpc which is rather
close to observations. Then, we show that the nonrelativistic approximation
(with respect to the peculiar velocities) is valid for $z \lesssim 10$, i.e.
approximately for 13 billion years from the present moment. We consider scalar
perturbations and, within the $\Lambda$CDM model, justify the main equations.
Moreover, we demonstrate that radiation can be naturally incorporated into our
scheme. This emphasizes the viability of our approach. This approach gives a
possibility to analyze different cosmological models and compare them with the
observable Universe. For example, we indicate some problematic aspects of the
spatially flat models. Such models require a rather specific distribution of
the inhomogeneities to get a finite potential at any points outside gravitating
masses. We also criticize the application of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter
solution to the description of the motion of test bodies on the cosmological
background.

to be one of a growing number of sources that display ""failed outbursts"", in
which the self-absorbed radio jets of the transient source are never fully
quenched and the thermal emission from the geometrically-thin inner accretion
disk never fully dominates the X-ray flux. We present multifrequency data from
the Very Large Array, Australia Telescope Compact Array and Karoo Array

Our rich data set exposes radio emission that displays a high level of large
scale variability compared to the X-ray emission and deviations from the
standard radio--X-ray correlation that are indicative of an unstable jet and
confirm the outburst's transition from the canonical hard state to an
intermediate state. We also observe steepening of the spectral index and an
increase of the linear polarization to a large fraction (~50%) of the total
flux, as well as a rotation of the electric vector position angle. These are
consistent with a transformation from a self-absorbed compact jet to
optically-thin ejecta -- the first time such a discrete ejection has been
observed in a failed outburst -- and may imply a complex magnetic field
geometry.

on graphene and newly discovered surfaces that are derived from graphene. Among
these substrates are graphane (abbreviated GH), which has an H atom bonded to
each C atom, and fluorographene (GF). For the graphite case, extensive
experimental and theoretical investigations have revealed that the phase
diagrams of the bose gases 4He and para-H2 are qualitatively similar, differing
primarily in a higher characteristic temperature scale for H2 than for He. The
phase behaviors of these films on one side of pristine graphene, or both sides
of free-standing graphene, are expected to be similar to those on graphite. We
point out the possibility of novel phenomena in adsorption on graphene related
to the large flexibility of the graphene sheet, to the non--negligible
interaction between atoms adsorbed on opposite sides of the sheet and to the
perturbation effect of the adsorbed layer on the Dirac electrons. In contrast,
the behaviors predicted on GF and GH surfaces are very different from those on
graphite, a result of the different corrugation, i.e., the lateral variation of
the potential experienced by these gases. As a result of this novel geometry
and potential, distinct properties are observed. For example, the 4He film's
ground-state on graphite is a two-dimensional (2D) crystal commensurate with
the substrate; on GF and GH, instead, it is predicted to be an anisotropic
superfluid. On GF the anisotropy is so extreme that the roton excitations are
very anisotropic, as if the bosons are moving in a multiconnected space along
the bonds of a honeycomb lattice. Such a novel phase has not been predicted or
observed previously on any substrate. Also, in the case of 3He the film's
ground-state is a fluid, thus offering the possibility of studying an
anisotropic Fermi fluid with a tunable density.

flaring chromospheric material using numerous emission lines that appear in the

coarsely localise the flare event on the star. We specifically used the optical
high-cadence spectra to demonstrate that both, turbulent and Stark broadening
are present during the first ten minutes of the first flare. Also, in the first
few minutes of this flare, we find short-lived (one to several minutes)

crucial to sustain cellular growth in changing environments. Metabolic networks
are often studied at steady state using constraint-based models and
optimization techniques. However, metabolic adaptations driven by changes in
gene expression cannot be analyzed by steady state models, as these do not
account for temporal changes in biomass composition. Here we present a dynamic
optimization framework that integrates the metabolic network with the dynamics
of biomass production and composition, explicitly taking into account enzyme
production costs and enzymatic capacity. In contrast to the established dynamic
flux balance analysis, our approach allows predicting dynamic changes in both
the metabolic fluxes and the biomass composition during metabolic adaptations.
We applied our algorithm in two case studies: a minimal nutrient uptake
network, and an abstraction of core metabolic processes in bacteria. In the
minimal model, we show that the optimized uptake rates reproduce the empirical
Monod growth for bacterial cultures. For the network of core metabolic
processes, the dynamic optimization algorithm predicted commonly observed
metabolic adaptations, such as a diauxic switch with a preference ranking for
different nutrients, re-utilization of waste products after depletion of the
original substrate, and metabolic adaptation to an impending nutrient
depletion. These examples illustrate how dynamic adaptations of enzyme
expression can be predicted solely from an optimization principle.

choose candidate expansion terms, as usual, from a set of pseudo relevant
documents; however, the usefulness of these terms is measured based on their
definitions provided in a hand-crafted lexical resource like WordNet.
Experiments with a number of standard TREC collections show that this method
outperforms existing WordNet based methods. It also compares favorably with
established QE methods such as KLD and RM3. Leveraging earlier work in which a
combination of QE methods was found to outperform each individual method (as
well as other well-known QE methods), we next propose a combination-based QE
method that takes into account three different aspects of a candidate expansion
term's usefulness: (i) its distribution in the pseudo relevant documents and in
the target corpus, (ii) its statistical association with query terms, and (iii)
its semantic relation with the query, as determined by the overlap between the
WordNet definitions of the term and query terms. This combination of diverse
sources of information appears to work well on a number of test collections,
viz., TREC123, TREC5, TREC678, TREC robust new and TREC910 collections, and
yields significant improvements over competing methods on most of these

active components that transform chemical energy into directed motion. These
artificial realizations of motility point in the direction of a new paradigm in
en- gineering, through the design of emergent behavior by manipulating
properties at the scale of the individual components. Catalytic colloidal
swimmers are a particularly promising example of such systems. Here we present
a comprehensive theoretical description of gradient-sensing of an individual
swimmer, leading controllably to chemotactic or anti-chemotactic behavior, and
use it to construct a framework for studying their collective behavior. We find
that both the positional and the orientational degrees of freedom of the active
colloids can exhibit condensation, signalling formation of clusters and asters.
The kinetics of catalysis introduces a natural control parameter for the range
of the interaction mediated by the diffusing chemical species. For various
regimes in parameter space in the long-ranged limit our system displays precise
analogs to gravitational collapse, plasma oscillations and electrostatic
screening. We present prescriptions for how to tune the surface properties of

cooperation between genetic mutations and acquired changes (phenotypic
plasticity). It is also assumed in this model that natural selection operates
on phenotypes, rather than genotypes, of individuals, and that the relationship
between phenotypes and genotypes is one-to-many. In the simulations based on
these assumptions, individuals exhibited phenotypic changes in response to an
environmental change, corresponding multiple genetic mutations were
increasingly accumulated in individuals in the population, and phenotypic
plasticity was gradually replaced with genetic mutations. This result suggests
that Lamarck's law of use and disuse can effectively hold without conflicting

\gamma-rays. Additionally, they often exhibit rapid flaring events at all
frequencies with doubling time scale of the TeV and X-ray flux on the order of
minutes, and such rapid flaring events are hard to explain theoretically. We
explore the effect of the synchrotron-self Compton cooling, which is inherently
time-dependent, leading to a rapid cooling of the electrons. Having discussed
intensively the resulting effects of this cooling scenario on the spectral
energy distribution of blazars in previous papers, the effects of the
time-dependent approach on the synchrotron lightcurve are investigated here.
Taking into account the retardation due to the finite size of the source and
the source geometry, we show that the time-dependent synchrotron-self Compton
(SSC) cooling still has profound effects on the lightcurve compared to the
usual linear (synchrotron and external Compton) cooling terms. This is most
obvious if the SSC cooling takes longer than the light crossing time scale.
Then in most frequency bands the variability time scale is up to an order of
magnitude shorter than under linear cooling conditions. This is yet another
strong indication that the time-dependent approach should be taken into account
for modeling blazar flares from compact emission regions.

were done in 5200 - 9000 Ang wavelength range. All observations were carried

region C near Herbig-Haro object, HH 22A, have been undergoing a slow dimming
at a rate of ~0.04 mag/yr and ~0.05 mag/yr respectively in R-band, which is 6
times slower than the rate during similar stage of V1647 Ori in 2003 outburst.
We detected change in flux distribution over the reflection nebula implying
changes in circumstellar matter distribution between 2003 and 2008 outbursts.

reconnection driven winds. Forbidden [O I] 6300 Ang and [Fe II] 7155 Ang lines

binary GR Mus (XB 1254-690), and find strong evidence for the presence of a

This provides further support that GR Mus indeed harbours a precessing
accretion disk (with a period of 6.74+/-0.07 day) that has retrograde
precession and is completely tilted out of the orbital plane along its line of
nodes. This tilt causes a large fraction of the gas in the accretion stream to
either over- or underflow the accretion disk instead of hitting the disk rim,
and could be a feature of all low mass X-ray binaries with characteristics
similar to GR Mus (i.e. the so-called atoll sources). Furthermore, we also find
marginal evidence for the presence of a positive superhump, suggesting that the
accretion disk in GR Mus is eccentric due to tidal resonances. If true, than
the relationship between the positive superhump period excess and the mass
ratio (q) provides a constraint of q=M_donor/M_NS=0.33-0.36. Together with the
radial velocity semi-amplitude measurements of the compact object, and previous

our approach we can transparently decompose the conductivity into intrinsic

existence of ISK, which originates from asymmetric Mott scattering but is
clearly distinguishable from conventional skew-scattering in that it converges
to a finite value in clean limit, was pointed out by Sinitsyn et al. [Phys.

  We use the SPI spectrometer on INTEGRAL and its observations along the
Galactic ridge to trace the line shape of the 1808.63 keV gamma-ray line from
26Al decay. We determine line centroids and compare these to Doppler shift
expectations from large-scale systematic rotation around the Galaxy's center,
as observed in other Galactic objects.
  We measure the radial velocities of gas traced by 26Al, averaged over the
line of sight, as a function of Galactic longitude. We find substantially
higher velocities than expected from Galactic rotation, the average bulk
velocity being ~200 km s^-1 larger than the Galactic-rotation prediction. The
observed radial velocity spread implies a Doppler-broadening of the gamma-ray
line that is consistent with our measurements of the overall line width. We can
reproduce the observed characteristics with 26Al sources located along the
inner spiral arms, when we add a global blow-out into the forward direction
away from arms, such as expected from massive stars offset towards the
spiral-arm leading edge. The superbubbles-halo connection implies
angular-momentum transfer in the disk-halo system and also radial gas flows.

energy is consistent with previous results for decaying compressible MHD
turbulence characterized by rapid energy decay with a power-law form of
$E\propto t^{-1}$ and by short decay time compared to a flow crossing time. If
initial magnetic fields are strong and perpendicular to the sheet, however,
long-term evolution of the kinetic energy shows that a significant amount of
turbulent energy ($\sim 0.2E_0$) still remains even after ten flow crossing
times for models with periodic boundary conditions. The decay rate is also
greatly reduced as the field strength increases for such initial and boundary
conditions, but not if the boundary conditions are that for a completely
isolated sheet. We analyze velocity power spectra of the remaining turbulence
to show that in-plane, incompressible motions parallel to the sheet dominate at

arbitrarily close in trace distance to states of $\mathcal{O}(\log_2 n)$
qubits, thus exhibiting an exponential separation in communication complexity
compared to the classical case. The protocol uses a number of optical modes
that is proportional to the size $n$ of the input bit-strings, but a total mean
photon number that is constant and independent of $n$. Given the expended
resources, our protocol achieves a task that is provably impossible using
classical communication only. In fact, even in the presence of realistic
experimental errors and loss, we show that there exist a large range of input
sizes for which our quantum protocol requires communication that can be more
than two orders of magnitude smaller than a classical fingerprinting protocol.

in preprojective indecomposables and simple homogeneous regulars (with
dimension the minimal radical vector) as well as their Gabriel-Roiter measures
are field independent. Using this result we can prove in a more general setting
a theorem by Bo Chen which states that the Gabriel-Roiter submodule of a simple
homogeneous regular (with dimension the minimal radical vector) is a
preprojective indecomposable of defect -1. The generalization consists in
considering the originally missing case $\tilde E_8$ and using arbitrary fields

Ringel (used in the Dynkin quiver context) of comparing all possible
Ringel-Hall polynomials with the special form they take in case of a
Gabriel-Roiter inclusion. For this purpose we compute (using a program written

that weak value techniques can put all of the Fisher information about the

standard method can have much larger information about the detected parameter

superior. We also describe other technical advantages unique to imaginary weak

of dose assignment is determined by comparing the observed toxicity rate at the

toxicity rate is located within the interval, we retain the current dose; if
the observed toxicity rate is greater than the upper boundary of the interval,
we deescalate the dose; and if the observed toxicity rate is smaller than the

boundaries so as to minimize the probability of inappropriate dose assignment
for patients. We show, both theoretically and numerically, that the resulting

Hence, here we attempt to model the artificial financial market in which each
trader $i$ can choose his/her decision among `buying', `selling' or `staying
(taking a wait-and-see attitude)', each of which corresponds to a realization
of the three state Ising spin, namely, $S_{i}=+1$, -1 and $S_{i}=0$,
respectively. The decision making of traders is given by the Gibbs-Boltzmann
distribution with the energy function. The energy function contains three
distinct terms, namely, the ferromagnetic two-body interaction term (endogenous
information), random field term as external information (exogenous news), and
chemical potential term which controls the number of traders who are watching
the market calmly at the instance. We specify the details of the model system
from the past financial market data to determine the conjugate hyper-parameters
and draw each parameter flow as a function of time-step. Especially we will
examine to what extent one can characterize the crisis by means of a brand-new
order parameter --- `turnover' --- which is defined as the number of active
traders who post their decisions $S_{i}=1,-1$, instead of $S_{i}=0$.

scenarios have been proposed for the spore's core region, containing the DNA

framework permeated by mobile water. In the glass scenario, the entire core,
including the water, is an amorphous solid and the quenched molecular diffusion
accounts for the spore's dormancy and thermal stability. Here, we use $^2$H
magnetic relaxation dispersion to selectively monitor water mobility in the
core of Bacillus subtilis spores in the presence and absence of core Mn$^{2+}$

value has been found in the initial spread of beam-particle momenta. This
threshold allows to discriminate between the resonant and non-resonant regimes.
The analysis of the thermalization of a few percents of the beam population

beam itself) is also performed and it confirms and deepens the understanding of

measured with radio antenna arrays - like LOPES at the Karlsruhe Institute of
Technology in Germany. To improve the understanding of the radio emission, we
test theoretical descriptions with measured data. The observables used for
these tests are the absolute amplitude of the radio signal, and the shape of
the radio lateral distribution. We compare lateral distributions of more than
500 LOPES events with two recent and public Monte Carlo simulation codes, REAS
3.11 and CoREAS (v 1.0). The absolute radio amplitudes predicted by REAS 3.11
are in good agreement with the LOPES measurements. The amplitudes predicted by
CoREAS are lower by a factor of two, and marginally compatible with the LOPES
measurements within the systematic scale uncertainties. In contrast to any
previous versions of REAS, REAS 3.11 and CoREAS now reproduce the shape of the
measured lateral distributions correctly. This reflects a remarkable progress
compared to the situation a few years ago, and it seems that the main processes
for the radio emission of air showers are now understood: The emission is
mainly due to the geomagnetic deflection of the electrons and positrons in the
shower. Less important but not negligible is the Askaryan effect (net charge
variation). Moreover, we confirm that the refractive index of the air plays an
important role, since it changes the coherence conditions for the emission:
Only the new simulations including the refractive index can reproduce rising
lateral distributions which we observe in a few LOPES events. Finally, we show
that the lateral distribution is sensitive to the energy and the mass of the
primary cosmic ray particles.

given to calculate the Taylor series of $X(N)$, $b(N)$ and $B(N)$. With this
scheme, the Taylor coefficients are calculated up to 5th order. The obtained
0th to 3rd order coefficients agree with the values presently available in the
literature. To the authors knowledge, the 4th and 5th order coefficients are
new results. It is then argued that a different series description of these
functions, based on the Taylor series of $c(N) \equiv b^{-1/3}X^{-4/3}$, leads
to a significant improvement in convergence.

"1309.6651","Pu Gao","Pu Gao and Michael Molloy","Inside the clustering threshold for random linear equations",,,,,"cs.DM math.CO math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study a random system of $cn$ linear equations over $n$ variables in
GF(2), where each equation contains exactly $r$ variables; this is equivalent
to $r$-XORSAT. \cite{ikkm,amxor} determined the clustering threshold, $c^*_r$:
if $c=c^*_r+\e$ for any constant $\e>0$, then \aas the solutions partition into
well-connected, well-separated {\em clusters} (with probability tending to 1 as
$n\rightarrow\infty$). This is part of a general clustering phenomenon which is
hypothesized to arise in most of the commonly studied models of random
constraint satisfaction problems, via sophisticated but mostly non-rigorous
techniques from statistical physics. We extend that study to the range
$c=c^*_r+o(1)$, showing that if $c=c^*_r+n^{-\d}, \d>0$, then the connectivity
parameter of each $r$-XORSAT cluster is $n^{\Theta(\d)}$, as compared to
$O(\log n)$ when $c=c^*_r+\e$. This means that one can move between any two
solutions in the same cluster via a sequence of solutions where consecutive
solutions differ on at most $n^{\Theta(\d)}$ variables; this is tight up to the
implicit constant. In contrast, moving to a solution in another cluster
requires that some pair of consecutive solutions differ in at least
$n^{1-O(\d)}$ variables.
  Along the way, we prove that in a random $r$-uniform hypergraph with
edge-density $n^{-\d}$ above the $k$-core threshold, \aas every vertex not in
the $k$-core can be removed by a sequence of $n^{\Theta(\d)}$ vertex-deletions
in which the deleted vertex has degree less than $k$; again, this is tight up
to the implicit constant.

  Time","9 pages, 1 figure",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.89.052102",,"cond-mat.stat-mech gr-qc quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we lay out an argument that generically the psychological arrow
of time should align with the thermodynamic arrow of time where that arrow is
well-defined. This argument applies to any physical system that can act as a
memory, in the sense of preserving a record of the state of some other system.
This result follows from two principles: the robustness of the thermodynamic
arrow of time to small perturbations in the state, and the principle that a
memory should not have to be fine-tuned to match the state of the system being
recorded. This argument applies even if the memory system itself is completely
reversible and non-dissipative. We make the argument with a paradigmatic
system, then formulate it more broadly for any system that can be considered a
memory. We illustrate these principles for a few other example systems, and
compare our criteria to earlier treatments of this problem.

the Brillouin zone. In the absence of any band crossing, each NL connects two
time reversal invariant momenta (TRIM) as partners. In the presence of a pair
of Dirac points (band crossing), for each band that crosses and for each WF

tissue is a much sought-after goal for biomedical applications such as
photodynamic therapy, optical manipulation, and photostimulation. However,
focusing with conventional lenses is restricted to one transport mean free path
in scattering media, limiting both optical penetration depth and resolution.
Focusing deeper is possible by using optical phase conjugation or wavefront
shaping to compensate for the scattering. For practical applications, wavefront
shaping offers the advantage of a robust optical system that is less sensitive
to optical misalignment. Here, the phase of the incident light is spatially
tailored using a phase-shifting array to pre-compensate for scattering. The
challenge, then, is to determine the phase pattern which allows light to be
optimally delivered to the target region. Optimization algorithms are typically
employed for this purpose, with visible particles used as targets to generate
feedback. However, using these particles is invasive, and light delivery is
limited to fixed points. Here, we demonstrate a method for non-invasive and
dynamic focusing, by using ultrasound encoding as a virtual guide star for
feedback to an optimization algorithm. The light intensity at the acoustic
focus was increased by an order of magnitude. This technique has broad
biomedical applications, such as in optogenetics or photoactivation of drugs.

show that the FLRW solutions are nonlinearly globally future-stable under small

harmonic-type coordinate system, in which the cosmological constant results in
the presence of dissipative terms in the evolution equations. Our result
extends the results of [38,44,42], where analogous results were proved for the
Euler-Einstein system under the equations of state p = c_s^2 \rho, 0<c_s^2 <=

difficulty that we overcome is that the energy density of the dust loses one
degree of differentiability compared to the cases 0 < c_s^2 <= 1/3. Because the
dust-Einstein equations are coupled, this loss of differentiability introduces
new obstacles for deriving estimates for the top-order derivatives of all
solution variables. To resolve this difficulty, we commute the equations with a
well-chosen differential operator and derive a collection of elliptic estimates
that complement the energy estimates of [38,44]. An important feature of our
analysis is that we are able to close our estimates even though the top-order

paradigm for a magnetic obstacle which will deviate the streamlines due to
Lorentz forces acting on the fluid elements. The duct is of square
cross-section. The dipole is located above the top wall and is centered in
spanwise direction. Our model uses the quasi-static approximation which is
applicable in the limit of small magnetic Reynolds numbers. The analysis covers
the stationary flow regime at small hydrodynamic Reynolds numbers Re as well as
the transitional time-dependent regime at higher values which may generate a
turbulent flow in the wake of the magnetic obstacle. We present a systematic

Hartmann number Ha, a measure of the strength of the magnetic dipole field.
Furthermore, three orientations of the dipole are compared: streamwise,
spanwise and wall-normal oriented dipole axes. The most efficient generation of
turbulence at a fixed distance above the duct follows for the spanwise
orientation, which is caused by a certain configuration of Hartmann layers and
reversed flow at the top plate. The enstrophy in the turbulent wake grows
linearly with Ha which is connected with a dominance of the wall-normal
z-derivative of the streamwise velocity.

of relaxation equations towards statistical equilibrium. These relaxation
equations can be used as a numerical algorithm to compute the maximum entropy
state. We mention the analogies with the Fokker-Planck equations derived by
Debye and H\""uckel for electrolytes. We then consider the limit of strong
mixing (or low energy). To leading order, the relationship between the
vorticity and the stream function at equilibrium is linear and the maximization
of the entropy becomes equivalent to the minimization of the enstrophy. This
expansion is similar to the Debye-H\""uckel approximation for electrolytes,
except that the temperature is negative instead of positive so that the
effective interaction between like-sign vortices is attractive instead of
repulsive. This leads to an organization at large scales presenting
geometry-induced phase transitions, instead of Debye shielding. We compare the
results obtained with point vortices to those obtained in the context of the
statistical mechanics of continuous vorticity fields described by the
Miller-Robert-Sommeria (MRS) theory. At linear order, we get the same results
but differences appear at the next order. In particular, the MRS theory
predicts a transition between sinh and tanh-like \omega-\psi relationships
depending on the sign of Ku-3 (where Ku is the Kurtosis) while there is no such
transition for point vortices which always show a sinh-like \omega-\psi
relationship. We derive the form of the relaxation equations in the strong

delays in the tracking system combined with typical high stiffness at contact
challenge the stability of the closed-loop system. The proposed concept of
operations is hybrid: the feedback signal is a superposition of a measured

functions with negative values, have been created so far only in a heralded
fashion. In this case, the desired output emerges rarely and randomly from a
quantum-state generator. An important example is the heralded production of
high-purity single-photon states, typically based on some nonlinear optical
interaction. In contrast, on-demand single-photon sources were also reported,
exploiting the quantized level structure of matter systems. These sources,
however, lead to highly impure output states, composed mostly of vacuum. While
such impure states may still exhibit certain single-photon-like features such
as anti-bunching, they are not enough nonclassical for advanced quantum
information processing. On the other hand, the intrinsic randomness of pure,
heralded states can be circumvented by first storing and then releasing them on
demand. Here we propose such a controlled release, and we experimentally
demonstrate it for heralded single photons. We employ two optical cavities,
where the photons are both created and stored inside one cavity, and finally
released through a dynamical tuning of the other cavity. We demonstrate storage
times of up to 300 ns, while keeping the single-photon purity around 50% after
storage. This is the first demonstration of a negative Wigner function at the
output of an on-demand photon source or a quantum memory. In principle, our
storage system is compatible with all kinds of nonclassical states, including
those known to be essential for many advanced quantum information protocols.

small subregions of computer model input space that have been identified in
previous experiments as worthy of further study. The method is capable of
producing uniform designs in subregions of computer model input space defined
by a membership function that consists of a continuous function passing a
threshold test, and does so far more efficiently than current methods when
these subregions are small. Our application is designing for regions of input
space that are not ruled out by history matching, a statistical methodology
applied in numerous diverse scientific applications whereby model runs are used
to cut out regions of input space that are incompatible with real world
observations. History matching defines a membership function for a region of
input space that is not ruled out yet by observations in the form of a distance
metric called implausibility. We use this distance metric to drive a new type
of Evolutionary Monte Carlo algorithm with a uniform distribution on the not
ruled out yet region as its target distribution. The algorithm can locate and
generate uniform points within extremely small subspaces of the computer model
input space with complex and even disconnected topologies. We illustrate the
performance of the technique in comparison to current methods with a number of
idealised examples. We then apply our algorithm to generating an optimal design
for the not ruled out yet region of a galaxy simulation model called GALFORM

supernovae, X-ray binaries, gravitational wave sources, and gamma ray bursts as

measure how the close binary properties of O and B-type stars vary with
metallicity. We have studied eclipsing binaries with early-B main-sequence
primaries in three galaxies with different metallicities: the Large and Small
Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC, respectively) as well as the Milky Way (MW).
The observed fractions of early-B stars which exhibit deep eclipses 0.25 <
Delta(m) (mag) < 0.65 and orbital periods 2 < P (days) < 20 in the MW, LMC, and
SMC span a narrow range of (0.7-1.0)%, which is a model independent result.
After correcting for geometrical selection effects and incompleteness toward
low-mass companions, we find for early-B stars in all three environments: (1) a
close binary fraction of (22+/-5)% across orbital periods 2 < P (days) < 20 and
mass ratios q = M_2/M_1 > 0.1, (2) an intrinsic orbital period distribution
slightly skewed toward shorter periods relative to a distribution that is
uniform in log P, (3) a mass-ratio distribution weighted toward low-mass
companions, and (4) a small, nearly negligible excess fraction of twins with q
> 0.9. Our fitted parameters derived for the MW eclipsing binaries match the
properties inferred from nearby, early-type spectroscopic binaries, which
further validates our results. There are no statistically significant trends
with metallicity, demonstrating that the close binary properties of massive
stars do not vary across metallicities -0.7 < log(Z/Z_sun) < 0.0 beyond the
measured uncertainties.

perspective on time series analysis. In its most abstract form, a mixed
membership model aims to associate an individual entity with some set of
attributes based on a collection of observed data. Although much of the
literature on mixed membership models considers the setting in which
exchangeable collections of data are associated with each member of a set of
entities, it is equally natural to consider problems in which an entire time
series is viewed as an entity and the goal is to characterize the time series
in terms of a set of underlying dynamic attributes or ""dynamic regimes"".
Indeed, this perspective is already present in the classical hidden Markov
model, where the dynamic regimes are referred to as ""states"", and the
collection of states realized in a sample path of the underlying process can be
viewed as a mixed membership characterization of the observed time series. Our
goal here is to review some of the richer modeling possibilities for time
series that are provided by recent developments in the mixed membership
framework.

suggestion that the brain is at, or close to, a critical state and may be a
self-organised critical system. Within the framework of self-organised
criticality a separation of timescales is thought to be crucial for the
observation of power-law dynamics and computational models are often
constructed with this property. However, this is not necessarily a
characteristic of physiological neural networks - external input does not only
occur when the network is at rest/a steady state. In this paper we study a
simple neuronal network model driven by a continuous external input (i.e.\ the
model does not have a separation of timescales) and analytically tuned to
operate in the region of a critical state (it reaches the critical regime
exactly in the absence of input - the case studied in the companion paper to
this article). The system displays avalanche dynamics in the form of cascades
of neuronal firing separated by periods of silence. We observe partial
scale-free behaviour in the distribution of avalanche size for low levels of
external input. We analytically derive the distributions of waiting times and
investigate their temporal behaviour in relation to different levels of
external input, showing that the system's dynamics can exhibit partial
long-range temporal correlations. We further show that as the system approaches
the critical state by two alternative `routes', different markers of
criticality (partial scale-free behaviour and long-range temporal correlations)
are displayed. This suggests that signatures of criticality exhibited by a
particular system in close proximity to a critical state are dependent on the
region in parameter space at which the system (currently) resides.

the initial stages of surfactant self-healing, Marangoni forces drive an
axisymmetric ridge inward to coalesce into a growing central distension; this
is unlike outward-spreading, in which the ridge decays. In later dynamics, the
distension slowly decays and the surfactant concentration equilibrates. We
present results from experiments in which we simultaneously measure the
surfactant concentration (using fluorescently-tagged lipids) and the fluid
height profile (via laser profilometry). We compare the results to simulations
of a mathematical model using parameters from our experiments. For surfactant
concentrations close to but below the critical monolayer concentration, we
observe agreement between the height profiles in the numerical simulations and
the experiment, but disagreement in the surfactant distribution. In experiments
at lower concentrations, the surfactant spreading and formation of a Marangoni
ridge are no longer present, and a persistent lipid-free region remains. This
observation, which is not captured by the simulations, has undesirable
implications for applications where uniform coverage is advantageous. Finally,
we probe the generality of the effect, and find that distensions of similar

certain isotopic abundances in oxygen-neon novae. Models currently predict as
much as 150 times the solar abundance of 33S in oxygen-neon nova ejecta. This
overproduction factor may, however, vary by orders of magnitude due to
uncertainties in the 33S(p,\gamma)34Cl reaction rate at nova peak temperatures.
Depending on this rate, 33S could potentially be used as a diagnostic tool for
classifying certain types of presolar grains. Better knowledge of the
33S(p,\gamma)34Cl rate would also aid in interpreting nova observations over
the S-Ca mass region and contribute to the firm establishment of the maximum
endpoint of nova nucleosynthesis. Additionally, the total S elemental abundance
which is affected by this reaction has been proposed as a thermometer to study
the peak temperatures of novae. Previously, the 33S(p,\gamma)34Cl reaction rate
had only been studied directly down to resonance energies of 432 keV. However,
for nova peak temperatures of 0.2-0.4 GK there are 7 known states in 34Cl both
below the 432 keV resonance and within the Gamow window that could play a
dominant role. Direct measurements of the resonance strengths of these states
were performed using the DRAGON recoil separator at TRIUMF. Additionally two
new states within this energy region are reported. Several hydrodynamic
simulations have been performed, using all available experimental information
for the 33S(p,\gamma)34Cl rate, to explore the impact of the remaining
uncertainty in this rate on nucleosynthesis in nova explosions. These
calculations give a range of ~ 20-150 for the expected 33S overproduction
factor, and a range of ~ 100-450 for the 32S/33S ratio expected in ONe novae.

displacement (MSD) of atoms and molecules in proteins from finite time
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Typical data from simulations are limited
to times of 1 to 10 ns and over this time period the calculated MSD continues
to increase without a clear limiting value. The proposed method consists of
fitting a model to MD simulation-derived values of the incoherent intermediate
neutron scattering function, $I_{inc}(Q,t)$, for finite times. The infinite
time MSD, $<r^2>$, appears as a parameter in the model and is determined by
fits of the model to the finite time $I_{inc}(Q,t)$. Specifically, the $<r^2>$
is defined in the usual way in terms of the Debye-Waller factor as $I(Q,t =
\infty) = \exp(- Q^2 <r^2 > /3)$. The method is illustrated by obtaining the
intrinsic MSD $<r^2>$ of hydrated lysozyme powder (h = 0.4 g water/g protein)
over a wide temperature range. The intrinsic $<r^2>$ obtained from data out to
1 ns and to 10 ns is found to be the same. The intrinsic $<r^2>$ is
approximately twice the value of the MSD that is reached in simulations after
times of 1 ns which correspond to those observed using neutron instruments that
have an energy resolution width of 1 \mu eV.

aspects of direct numerical simulations (DNS) regarding the growth rate of this
large-scale instability, shape of the resulting magnetic structures, and their
height as a function of magnetic field strength. Unlike the case of an imposed
horizontal field, for a vertical one, magnetic flux concentrations of
equipartition strength with the turbulence can be reached. This results in
magnetic spots that are reminiscent of sunspots. Here we want to find out under
what conditions magnetic flux concentrations with vertical field occur and what
their internal structure is. We use a combination of MFS, DNS, and implicit
large-eddy simulations to characterize the resulting magnetic flux
concentrations in forced isothermal turbulence with an imposed vertical
magnetic field. We confirm earlier results that in the kinematic stage of the
large-scale instability the horizontal wavelength of structures is about 10
times the density scale height. At later times, even larger structures are
being produced in a fashion similar to inverse spectral transfer in helically
driven turbulence. Using turbulence simulations, we find that magnetic flux
concentrations occur for different values of the Mach number between 0.1 and
0.7. DNS and MFS show magnetic flux tubes with mean-field energies comparable
to the turbulent kinetic energy. The resulting vertical magnetic flux tubes are
being confined by downflows along the tubes and corresponding inflow from the
sides, which keep the field concentrated.

is doing fine, including QCD, the electroweak sector and flavour physics. The
good news is that a Standard-Model-like Higgs boson has appeared with the
predicted mass, but the bad news is that the LHC has provided no hint of other
new physics. On the other hand, physics beyond the Standard Model is needed to
explain neutrino masses and mixing, and we look forward to experiments
revealing their mass hierarchy and CP violation. Cosmology and astrophysics
also require new physics to explain the origin of matter, dark matter, dark
energy and the CMB fluctuations. I still think that supersymmetry is the
best-motivated extension of the Standard Model, and look forward to the next
phases of LHC operation at higher energy and luminosity. In the mean time,
ideas abound for a new accelerator to study the Higgs boson in detail and/or
whatever else the LHC may reveal in its next run.

that AGNs divide into two relatively distinct populations or ""branches"" in the
plane of MIR and radio luminosity. Seyfert galaxies lie almost exclusively on a
MIR-bright branch (Branch A), while low-ionization nuclear emission line
galaxies (LINERs) are split evenly into Branch A and the MIR-faint Branch B. We
devise various tests to constrain the processes that define the branches,
including a comparison to the properties of pure star-forming (SF) inactive
galaxies on the MIR-Radio plane. We demonstrate that the total MIR emission of
objects on Branch A, including most Seyfert galaxies, is governed primarily by
host star-formation, with about 15% of the 22 micron luminosity coming from
AGN-heated dust. This implies that on-going dusty star-formation is a general
property of Seyfert host galaxies. We show that the 12 micron broad-band
luminosity of AGNs on Branch A is suppressed with respect to star-forming
galaxies, possibly due to the destruction of PAHs or deeper 10 microns Si
absorption in AGNs. We uncover a correlation between the MIR luminosity and [O
III] luminosity in AGNs. This suggests a relationship between the SFR and
nuclear luminosity in the AGN population, but we caution on the importance of
selection effects inherent to such AGN-dominated emission-line galaxies in
driving such a correlation. We highlight the MIR-radio plane as a useful tool
in comparative studies of SF and nuclear activity in AGN.

observable is based on the thrust cone jet algorithm, which involves a veto
scale for out-of-jet radiation. The previously uncomputed part of our result
depends in a complicated way on the jet cone size, r, and at intermediate
stages of the calculation we actually encounter a new class of multiple
polylogarithms. We employ an extension of the coproduct calculus to
systematically exploit functional relations and represent our results
concisely. In contrast to the individual contributions, the sum of all global
terms can be expressed in terms of classical polylogarithms. Our explicit
two-loop calculation enables us to clarify the small r picture discussed in
earlier work. In particular, we show that the resummation of the logarithms of
r that appear in the previously uncomputed part of the two-loop integrated jet
thrust distribution is inextricably linked to the resummation of the non-global
logarithms. Furthermore, we find that the logarithms of r which cannot be
absorbed into the non-global logarithms in the way advocated in earlier work
have coefficients fixed by the two-loop cusp anomalous dimension. We also show
that, given appropriate L-loop contributions to the integrated hemisphere soft
function, one can straightforwardly predict a number of potentially large
logarithmic contributions at L loops not controlled by the factorization
theorem for jet thrust.

chemically indistinguishable from Milky Way field stars with the exception of
one candidate, C222531-145437. From its position, velocity, and detailed

analysis indicates the low and medium-probability target are metal-rich field
stars. The remaining three high-probability targets range over $\sim$1 dex in
metallicity, and are chemically distinct compared to the other 2 targets and
all standard stars: low [$\alpha$/Fe] abundance ratios are observed, and lower
limits are ascertained for [Ba/Y], which sit well above the Milky Way trend.
These chemical signatures demonstrate that the undiscovered parent system is
unequivocally a dwarf spheroidal galaxy, consistent with dynamical constraints
inferred from the stream width and arc. As such, we firmly exclude the proposed
association between NGC 2419 and the Orphan stream. A wide range in
metallicities adds to the similarities between the Orphan stream and Segue 1,

for twelve galaxy clusters and groups at z~0.1 with M=1-5e14 Msun. This paper
improves upon our previous work through the addition of XMM data, enabling
measurements of the total mass and masses of each major baryonic component ---
ICM, intracluster stars, and stars in galaxies --- for each system. We recover
a relation for the stellar mass versus halo mass consistent with our previous
result. We confirm that the partitioning of baryons between the stellar and hot
gas components is a strong function of M500; the fractions of total mass in
stars and X-ray gas within r500 scale as M500^-0.45 and M500^0.26,
respectively. We also confirm that the combination of the BCG and intracluster
stars is an increasingly important contributor to the stellar baryon budget in
lower halo masses. We find a weak, but statistically significant, dependence of
the total baryon fraction upon halo mass, scaling as M500^0.16. For M500>2e14,
the total baryon fractions within r500 are on average 18% (7%) below the
Universal value from the WMAP7 (Planck) analysis. For Planck, the difference
between the Universal value and cluster baryon fractions is less than the
systematic uncertainties associated with M500. The total baryon fractions
exhibit significant scatter, particularly at M500<2e14 Msun where they range
from 60-90% (65-100%) of the Universal value for WMAP7 (Planck). The ratio of
the stellar-to-gas mass within r500, a measure of star formation efficiency,
strongly decreases with M500. The fact that this relation remains tight at low
mass implies that the larger scatter in the total baryon fractions at these
masses arises from either true scatter in the total baryon content or
observational scatter in M500, rather than late-time physical processes such as
redistribution of gas to beyond r500. (abridged)

discrete (or spreads in) populations in colour-magnitude diagrams and abundance
variations in light elements (e.g., Na, O, Al). Multiple models have been put
forward to explain the observed anomalies, although all have serious
shortcomings (e.g., requiring a non-standard initial mass function of stars and
GCs to have been initially 10-100 times more massive than observed today).
These models also do not agree with observations of massive stellar clusters
forming today, which do not display significant age spreads nor have gas/dust
within the cluster. Here we present a model for the formation of GCs, where low
mass pre-main sequence (PMS) stars accrete enriched material released from
interacting massive binary and rapidly rotating stars onto their circumstellar
discs, and ultimately onto the young stars. As was shown in previous studies,
the accreted material matches the unusual abundances and patterns observed in
GCs. The proposed model does not require multiple generations of
star-formation, conforms to known properties of massive clusters forming today,
and solves the ""mass budget problem"" without requiring GCs to have been
significantly more massive at birth. Potential caveats to the model as well as

are almost as tuned as the simplest version of SUSY, the MSSM: at best at the
percent level. In this paper, we further examine how current LHC results
constrain naturalness in three classes of models that may relax LHC bounds on
sparticles: split families, baryonic RPV, and Dirac gauginos. In models of
split families and bRPV, the bounds on the gluino are only slightly reduced,
resulting in a few percent tuning. In particular, having a natural spectrum in
bRPV models typically implies that tops, Ws, and Zs are easily produced in the
cascade decays of squarks and gluinos. The resulting leptons and missing energy
push the gluino mass limit above 1 TeV. Even when the gluino has a Dirac mass

calculable models because there is no symmetry imposing the supersoft limit. We
conclude that, even if sparticles are found at LHC-14, naturalness will not

In the case of pulsed light for high harmonic generation, we find the radiated

parameters of the system, except for the amplitude of the driving field, which
determines the range of high harmonics generated and a tendency toward a

classes of functional equation. Let $Z$ be a compact Abelian group and $U_1$,
\ldots, $U_k \leq Z$ be closed subgroups. Given $f:Z\to\mathbb{T}$ and $w \in

notation, we shall study solutions to the system of difference equations
\[d_{u_1}\cdots d_{u_k}f \equiv 0 \quad \forall (u_1,\ldots,u_k) \in
\prod_{i\leq k}U_i,\] and to the zero-sum problem \[f_1 + \cdots + f_k = 0\]
for functions $f_i:Z\to \mathbb{T}$ that are $U_i$-invariant for each $i$.
  Part I of this work showed that the $Z$-modules of solutions to these
problems can be described using a general theory of `almost modest
$\P$-modules'. Much of the global structure of these solution $Z$-modules could
then be extracted from results about the closure of this general class under
certain natural operations, such as forming cohomology groups. The main result
of the present paper is that solutions to either problem can always be
decomposed into summands which either solve a simpler system of equations, or
have some special `step polynomial' structure. This will be proved by
augmenting the definition of `almost modest $\mathcal{P}$-modules' further, to
isolate a subclass in which elements can be represented by the desired `step
polynomials'. We will then find that this subclass is closed under the same
operations.

estimating redshifts of galaxy spectra in spectral surveys that is particularly
adept in the very low SNR regime. We use a standard cross-correlation method to
estimate the redshifts of galaxies, using a template set built using a PCA
analysis on a set of simulated, noise-free spectra. Darth Fader employs wavelet
filtering to both estimate the continuum & to extract prominent line features
in each galaxy spectrum. A simple selection criterion based on the number of
features present in the spectrum is then used to clean the catalogue: galaxies
with fewer than six total features are removed as we are unlikely to obtain a
reliable redshift estimate. Applying our wavelet-based cleaning algorithm to a
simulated testing set, we successfully build a clean catalogue including
extremely low signal-to-noise data (SNR=2.0), for which we are able to obtain a
5.1% catastrophic failure rate in the redshift estimates (compared with 34.5%
prior to cleaning). We also show that for a catalogue with uniformly mixed SNRs
between 1.0 & 20.0, with realistic pixel-dependent noise, it is possible to
obtain redshifts with a catastrophic failure rate of 3.3% after cleaning (as
compared to 22.7% before cleaning). Whilst we do not test this algorithm
exhaustively on real data, we present a proof of concept of the applicability
of this method to real data, showing that the wavelet filtering techniques
perform well when applied to some typical spectra from the SDSS archive. The
Darth Fader algorithm provides a robust method for extracting spectral features
from very noisy spectra. The resulting clean catalogue gives an extremely low
rate of catastrophic failures, even when the spectra have a very low SNR. For
very large sky surveys, this technique may offer a significant boost in the
number of faint galaxies with accurately determined redshifts.

antiferromagnet. Behavior of these quantities is presented in the
temperaturefield parameter space for selected mild degrees of dilution. It is
found that, besides the anomalies associated with phase transitions from the
ferrimagnetic to the paramagnetic state, in some regions of the parameter space
these functions display some more anomalies and peculiarities, as a result of
joint effects of the geometrical frustration, magnetic dilution, thermal
fluctuations and the applied magnetic field.

GJ 581, an M3 dwarf, hosts a rich system of exo-planets, some of
which are potentially within or at the edge of the Habitable Zone. Nevertheless
the system habitability might be reduced by large and sterilizing high energy
emission flares, if these are frequent. Aims. The GJ 581 radiation environment
was studied with simultaneous X-ray and UV observations, performed with the XRT
and UVOT instruments, respectively, on board of the SWIFT satellite. Methods.
X-ray and UV data were analysed with the distributed standard tools. Results.
GJ 581 was detected for the first time in the 0.2-10 keV range, with an
intensity of (8+-2)x10^{-4} cts/s and a signal-to-noise ratio of 3.6. If
black-body or APEC spectra are assumed then the source X-ray flux is found to
be between 1.8 and 3.3x10^{-14}erg cm^{-2}s^{-1} and log10(L_{X}) between
25.914 and 26.176. Despite hints of X-ray variability, better statistics will
be needed to establish robust evidence for that. The UV measurements, obtained
during 13 pointings, are also reported. A combination of these Swift X-ray and
Hubble Space Telescope UV measurements (with Lyman-alpha) indicate a low X-ray
to UV luminosity ratio of ~4%. Conclusions. Simultaneous X-ray and UV
observations of GJ 581 are reported. These constitute an experimental view of
the system radiation environment, which will be a useful input for the
habitability studies of the GJ 581 planetary system.

methods: direct construction of the Newman-Penrose (NP) scalar $\Psi_4$ at a
finite distance from the source and Cauchy-characteristic extraction (CCE). The
direct NP approach is simpler than CCE, but NP waveforms can be contaminated by
near-zone effects---unless the waves are extracted at several distances from
the source and extrapolated to infinity. Even then, the resulting waveforms can
in principle be contaminated by gauge effects. In contrast, CCE directly
provides, by construction, gauge-invariant waveforms at future null infinity.
We verify the gauge invariance of CCE by running the same physical simulation
using two different gauge conditions. We find that these two gauge conditions
produce the same CCE waveforms but show differences in extrapolated-$\Psi_4$
waveforms. We examine data from several different binary configurations and
measure the dominant sources of error in the extrapolated-$\Psi_4$ and CCE
waveforms. In some cases, we find that NP waveforms extrapolated to infinity
agree with the corresponding CCE waveforms to within the estimated error bars.
However, we find that in other cases extrapolated and CCE waveforms disagree,
most notably for $m=0$ ""memory"" modes.

groups and clusters identified in the MaxBCG sample. We fit two models to the
MOF, a power law and a 4-parameter model. The number distribution of quasars in
host halos is close to Poisson, and the slopes of the MOF obtained from our
best-fit models (for the power law case) favor a MOF that monotonically
increases with halo mass. The best-fit slopes are $0.53 \pm 0.04$ and $1.03\pm
1.12$ for the power law model and the 4-parameter model, respectively. We
measure the radial distribution of quasars within dark matter halos and find it
to be adequately described by a power law with a slope $-2.3 \pm 0.4$. We
measure the conditional luminosity function (CLF) of quasars and show that
there is no evidence that quasar luminosity depends on host halo mass, similar
to the inferences drawn from clustering measurements. We also measure the
conditional black hole mass function (CMF) of our quasars. Although the results
are consistent with no dependence on halo mass, we observe a slight indication
of downsizing of the black hole mass function. The lack of halo mass dependence
in the CLF and CMF shows that quasars residing in galaxy clusters have
characteristic luminosity and black hole mass scales.

to the outer haloes. We find the transition radius between the relative
dominance of the inner-halo and outer-halo stellar populations to be ~15-20 kpc
for most of our haloes, similar to that inferred for the Milky Way from recent
observations. While the number density of stars in the simulated inner-halo
populations decreases rapidly with distance, the outer-halo populations
contribute about 20-40 per cent in the fiducial solar neighborhood, in
particular at the lowest metallicities. We have determined [Fe/H] profiles for
our simulated haloes; they exhibit flat or mild gradients, in the range
[-0.002, -0.01 ] dex/kpc. The metallicity distribution functions exhibit
different features, reflecting the different assembly history of the individual
stellar haloes. We find that stellar haloes formed with larger contributions
from massive subgalactic systems have steeper metallicity gradients. Very
metal-poor stars are mainly contributed to the halo systems by lower-mass
satellites. There is a clear trend among the predicted metallicity distribution
functions that a higher fraction of low-metallicity stars are found with
increasing radius. These properties are consistent with the range of behaviours
observed for stellar haloes of nearby galaxies.

pattern intensities from two-dimensional (2D) planar detectors with good
estimates of their standard deviations. We describe methods to estimate
uncertainties when the same image is measured in multiple frames as well as
from a single frame. We show the importance of considering the correlation of
diffraction points during the integration and the re-sampling process of data
analysis. We find that correlations between adjacent pixels in the image can
lead to seriously overestimated uncertainties if it is neglected in the
integration process. Off-diagonal entries in the variance-covariance (VC)
matrix are problematic as virtually all data processing and modeling programs
cannot handle the full VC matrix. We show the off-diagonal terms come mainly
from the pixel splitting algorithm used as the default integration algorithm in
many popular 2D integration programs, as well as from re-binning and
re-sampling steps later in the processing. When the full VC matrix can be
propagated during the data reduction, it is possible to get accurate refined
parameters and their uncertainties at the cost of increasing computational
complexity. However, as this is not normally possible, we explore the best
approximate methods for data processing in order to estimate uncertainties on
refined parameters with the greatest accuracy from just the diagonal variance
terms in the VC matrix.

Application layer multicast builds a peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay multicast tree
topology consisting of end-to-end unicast connections between end-hosts. End
users self organize themselves into logical overlay networks for efficient data
delivery. Major concern in designing ALM protocol is how to build and maintain
a topology, to route data efficiently and reliably. We propose here a scheme in
which the topology is built incrementally while maintaining dual feeds of the
media stream to any node from the source with minimum differential delay in
receiving packets from both alternatives. We have made the assumption of
availability of a P2P query search network. This enables building of multicast
tree directly as an overlay. There is no need of maintaining an overlaid mesh
and running multicast routing protocol to maintain a multicast tree in this
mesh. Thus the scheme is much more simplified than in the earlier work on
multicast overlay mesh creation and management and then creation and management

interfaces with preexisting cracks and on the interface crack dynamics was
investigated using MD for both <100> and <110> aluminum STGBs. In simulations
with a crack at the interface, this research shows how the maximum normal
strength of the interface correlates with the respective GB energy, the GB
misorientation, and the GB structural description. For instance, the normal
interface strength for GBs containing D structural unit (SU) or stacking faults
in the GB structural description ({\Sigma}13 (510) {\theta}=22.6{\deg} and
{\Sigma}97 (940) {\theta}=47.9{\deg}) shows a noticeable decrease in interface
strength, as compared to other evaluated <100> GBs that contained favored SUs.
In the case of <110> interfaces, the presence of the E SU in the GB structure
lowers the maximum normal interface strength by 35%. Further investigation of
the deformation at the crack tip in GBs containing the E structure revealed
that the E SU underwent atomic shuffling to accommodate intrinsic stacking
faults (ISFs) along the interface, which in turn acts as a site for partial
dislocation nucleation. Interestingly, regardless of GB misorientation, GB
interfaces examined here containing the E structure in their structural period
exhibited relatively small variation in maximum normal strength of interface.
The GB volume ahead of the crack tip underwent structural rearrangement which,
in turn, influenced the crack propagation mechanism. In most GBs, the crack
propagation was due to alternating mechanisms of dislocation emission, followed
by propagation of dislocation (blunting) and cleavage/crack advance. Moreover,
the crack growth rates along the GB interface were strongly influenced by the
initial free volume at the interface, i.e., faster crack growth was observed
along interfaces with higher initial free volume.

qualitatively similar from one day to the next. 38% of the contacts occurred

could potentially act as super-spreaders. Wearable sensors represent a novel
tool for the measurement of contact patterns in hospitals. The collected data
provides information on important aspects that impact the spreading patterns of
infectious diseases, such as the strong heterogeneity of contact numbers and
durations across individuals, the variability in the number of contacts during
a day, and the fraction of repeated contacts across days. This variability is
associated with a marked statistical stability of contact and mixing patterns

major challenge of online social networks (OSNs). State of the art requires
prior interaction to grant access. Sharing with users who are not subscribed or
previously have not been accepted as contacts in any case is only possible via
public posts, which can easily be abused by automatic harvesting for user
profiling, targeted spear-phishing, or spamming. Moreover, users are restricted
to the access rules defined by the provider, which may be overly restrictive,
cumbersome to define, or insufficiently fine-grained.
  We suggest a complementary approach that can be easily deployed in addition
to existing access control schemes, does not require any interaction, and
includes even public, unsubscribed users. It exploits the fact that different
social circles of a user share different experiences and hence encrypts
arbitrary posts. Hence arbitrary posts are encrypted, such that only users with
sufficient knowledge about the owner can decrypt.
  Assembling only well-established cryptographic primitives, we prove that the
security of our scheme is determined by the entropy of the required knowledge.
We consequently analyze the efficiency of an informed dictionary attack and
assess the entropy to be on par with common passwords. A fully functional
implementation is used for performance evaluations, and available for download

Consequently, solving for these degrees of freedom involves the solution of a
potentially much smaller system. This not only reduces storage requirements,

adaptation is driven by an error estimate obtained via a discrete adjoint
approach. Furthermore, the computed target functional can be corrected with

velocity follows by a Fourier transform from the frequency- dependence of the
impedance involving friction coefficient, body mass, and added fluid mass. A
term proportional to the square root of frequency in the asymptotic high
frequency expansion of the impedance, with a Basset coefficient, describes the
initial decay in time from the initial value determined by the effective mass.
It is shown from numerical evidence based on the exact multipole expansion of
the solution for the flow field in terms of spheroidal wavefunctions that the
knowledge of the Basset coefficient is insufficient for a reliable estimate of
the deviations from a simple two-pole approximation to the complete behavior in
time. The two-pole approximation can be calculated from the effective mass and
the steady state friction coefficient.

($\sim11$\,keV and $\sim0.33$\,solar) plasmas; the former is localized at the

these ICM emissions, a strongly absorbed power-law component is found, which is
due to an active galactic nucleus (AGN) in the cluster center. The absorption
column density and unobscured luminosity of the AGN are
$\sim3.2\times10^{23}$\,cm$^{-2}$ and $\sim4.7\times10^{45}$\,ergs\,s$^{-1}$
(2-10\,keV), respectively. Furthermore, a neutral iron (\ion{Fe}{1}) K-shell
line is discovered for the first time with the equivalent width (EW) of
$\sim150$\,eV at the rest frame. The column density and the EW of the
\ion{Fe}{1} line are exceptionally large for such a high luminosity AGN, and
hence the AGN is classified as a type 2 quasi-stellar object (QSO). We
speculate that the significant fraction of the ICM cooled gas would be consumed
to maintain the torus and to activate the type 2 QSO. The Phoenix cluster has a
massive starburst in the central galaxy, indicating suppression in the cooling
flow is less effective. This may be because the onset of the latest AGN
feedback has occurred recently and it has not yet been effective.
Alternatively, the AGN feedback is predominantly in radiative-mode not in
kinetic-mode and the torus may work as a shield to reduce its effect.

it requires the feedback of the instantaneous channel state information (CSI)

amplifies its analog noisy observation using a quantized version of its optimal

over time at the server asking for a specific page. When the server transmits a
page, all outstanding requests for the page are simultaneously satisfied, and
this is what distinguishes broadcast scheduling from the standard scheduling
setting where each job must be processed separately by the server. Broadcast
scheduling has received a considerable amount of attention due to the
algorithmic challenges that it gives in addition to its applications in
multicast systems and wireless and LAN networks. In this paper, we give the
following new approximation results for two popular objectives:
  - For the objective of minimizing the maximum flow time, we give the first
PTAS. Previously, it was known that the algorithm First-In-First-Out (FIFO) is
a 2-approximation, and it is tight. It has been suggested as an open problem to
obtain a better approximation.
  - For the objective of maximizing the throughput, we give a
0.7759-approximation which improves upon the previous best known
0.75-approximation.
  Our improved results are enabled by our novel rounding schemes and linear
programming which can effectively reduce congestion in schedule which is often
the main bottleneck in designing scheduling algorithms based on linear
programming. We believe that our algorithmic ideas and techniques could be of
potential use for other scheduling problems.

partial differential equations describing the non-ideal transport of a
N-component electrolyte in a dilute Newtonian solvent through a rigid porous
medium. Realistic non-ideal effects are taken into account by an approach based
on the mean spherical approximation (MSA) model which takes into account finite
size ions and screening effects. We first consider equilibrium solutions in the
absence of external forces. In such a case, the velocity and diffusive fluxes
vanish and the equilibrium electrostatic potential is the solution of a variant
of Poisson-Boltzmann equation coupled with algebraic equations. Contrary to the
ideal case, this nonlinear equation has no monotone structure. However, based
on invariant region estimates for Poisson-Boltzmann equation and for small
characteristic value of the solute packing fraction, we prove existence of at
least one solution. To our knowledge this existence result is new at this level
of generality. When the motion is governed by a small static electric field and
a small hydrodynamic force, we generalize O'Brien's argument to deduce a
linearized model. Our second main result is the rigorous homogenization of
these linearized equations and the proof that the effective tensor satisfies
Onsager properties, namely is symmetric positive definite. We eventually make
numerical comparisons with the ideal case. Our numerical results show that the
MSA model confirms qualitatively the conclusions obtained using the ideal model
but there are quantitative differences arising that can be important at high
charge or high concentrations.

Penna, Akshay Kulkarni, Ramesh Narayan","A new equilibrium torus solution and GRMHD initial conditions","8 pages, 4 figures, A&A accepted",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201219666",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  General relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations are providing
influential models for black hole spin measurements, gamma ray bursts, and
supermassive black hole feedback. Many of these simulations use the same
initial condition: a rotating torus of fluid in hydrostatic equilibrium. A
persistent concern is that simulation results sometimes depend on arbitrary
features of the initial torus. For example, the Bernoulli parameter (which is
related to outflows), appears to be controlled by the Bernoulli parameter of
the initial torus. In this paper, we give a new equilibrium torus solution and
describe two applications for the future. First, it can be used as a more
physical initial condition for GRMHD simulations than earlier torus solutions.
Second, it can be used in conjunction with earlier torus solutions to isolate
the simulation results that depend on initial conditions. We assume
axisymmetry, an ideal gas equation of state, constant entropy, and ignore
self-gravity. We fix an angular momentum distribution and solve the
relativistic Euler equations in the Kerr metric. The Bernoulli parameter,
rotation rate, and geometrical thickness of the torus can be adjusted
independently. Our torus tends to be more bound and have a larger radial extent
than earlier torus solutions. While this paper was in preparation, several
GRMHD simulations appeared based on our equilibrium torus. We believe it will
continue to provide a more realistic starting point for future simulations.

systems. RoCTL* extends CTL* with the addition of Obligatory and Robustly
operators, which quantify over failure-free paths and paths with one more
failure respectively. We present a number of examples of problems to which
RoCTL* can be applied. The core result of this paper is to show that RoCTL* is
expressively equivalent to CTL* but is non-elementarily more succinct. We
present a translation from RoCTL* into CTL* that preserves truth but may result
in non-elementary growth in the length of the translated formula as each nested
Robustly operator may result in an extra exponential blowup. However, we show
that this translation is optimal in the sense that any equivalence preserving
translation will require an extra exponential growth per nested Robustly. We
also compare RoCTL* to Quantified CTL* (QCTL*) and hybrid logics.

high-resolution hyperspectral images. At the core of the algorithm, a new
rank-two nonnegative matrix factorizations (NMF) algorithm is used to split the
clusters, which is motivated by convex geometry concepts. The method starts
with a single cluster containing all pixels, and, at each step, (i) selects a
cluster in such a way that the error at the next step is minimized, and (ii)
splits the selected cluster into two disjoint clusters using rank-two NMF in
such a way that the clusters are well balanced and stable. The proposed method
can also be used as an endmember extraction algorithm in the presence of pure
pixels. The effectiveness of this approach is illustrated on several synthetic
and real-world hyperspectral images, and shown to outperform standard
clustering techniques such as k-means, spherical k-means and standard NMF.

to suffer from the problems of either large backreaction or strong coupling,
which make it difficult to self-consistently achieve cosmic magnetic fields
from inflation with a field strength larger than $10^{-32} G$ today on the
$\Mpc$ scale. Such a strength is insufficient to act as seed for the galactic
dynamo effect, which requires a magnetic field larger than $10^{-20} G$. In
this paper we analyze simple extensions of the minimal model, which avoid both
the strong coupling and back reaction problems, in order to generate
sufficiently large magnetic fields on the Mpc scale today. First we study the
possibility that the coupling function which breaks the conformal invariance of
electromagnetism is non-monotonic with sharp features. Subsequently, we
consider the effect of lowering the energy scale of inflation jointly with a
scenario of prolonged reheating where the universe is dominated by a stiff
fluid for a short period after inflation. In the latter case, a systematic
study shows upper bounds for the magnetic field strength today on the Mpc scale
of $10^{-13} G$ for low scale inflation and $10^{-25} G$ for high scale
inflation, thus improving on the previous result by 7-19 orders of magnitude.
These results are consistent with the strong coupling and back reaction
constraints.

Third, as a conditioned average of generalized observable eigenvalues it

atoms can be effectively described as macroscopic single particle systems in a
mean-field approximation. In the case of a Bose-Hubbard system, modelling
bosons on a discrete lattice with on-site interactions, this yields a discrete
nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation of Gross-Pitaevskii type. It has been recently
shown that the correspondence between the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and the
Bose-Hubbard system breaks down for complex extensions. In particular, for a
Bose-Hubbard dimer with complex on-site energy the mean-field approximation
yields a generalised complex nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation. Conversely, a
Gross-Pitaevskii equation with complex on-site energies arises as the
mean-field approximation of many-particle Lindblad dynamics rather than a
complex extension of the Bose-Hubbard system. Here we address the question of
how the mean-field description is modified in the presence of a complex-valued
particle interaction term for a Bose-Hubbard dimer. We derive the mean-field
equations of motion leading to nonlinear dissipative Bloch dynamics, related to
a nontrivial complex generalisation of the nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation.
The resulting dynamics are analysed in detail. It is shown that depending on
the parameter values there can be up to six stationary states, and for small
values of the interaction strength there are limit cycles. Furthermore, we show
how a Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a complex interaction term can be derived
as the mean-field approximation of a Bose-Hubbard dimer with an additional
Lindblad term modelling two-particle losses.

merger-driven growth of bulges. These processes are implicit in semi-analytical
models of galaxy formation, with bulge growth in particular relating directly
to the hierarchical build-up of halos and their galaxies. In this paper, we
consider several implementations of two semi-analytical models. Focusing on
implementations in which bulges are formed during mergers only, we examine the
fractions of elliptical galaxies and both passive and star-forming disk
galaxies as functions of stellar and halo mass, for central and satellite
systems. This is compared to an observational cross-matched SDSS+RC3 z ~ 0
sample of galaxies with accurate visual morphological classifications and
M_{stellar} > 10^10.5 M_{sol}. The models qualitatively reproduce the observed
increase of elliptical fraction with stellar mass, and with halo mass for
central galaxies, supporting the idea that observed ellipticals form during
major mergers. However, the overall elliptical fraction produced by the models
is much too high compared with the z ~ 0 data. Since the ""passive"" -- i.e.
non-star-forming -- fractions are approximately reproduced, and since the
fraction which are star-forming disc galaxies is also reproduced, the problem
is that the models overproduce ellipticals at the expense of passive S0 and
spiral galaxies. Bulge-growth implementations (tuned to reproduce simulations)
which allow the survival of residual discs in major mergers still destroy too
much of the disc. Increasing the lifetime of satellites, or allowing
significant disc regrowth around merger remnants, merely increases the fraction
of star-forming disc galaxies. Instead, it seems necessary to reduce the mass
ratios of merging galaxies, so that most mergers produce modest bulge growth in
disc-galaxy remnants instead of ellipticals. [Abridged]

which a similar device can be used as an electric generator, converting the
rotating mechanical energy to electrical energy. The liquid film electric
generator (LFEG) is in stark contrast to the LFM, both of which could be
designed similarly in very small scales like micro scales with different
applications. Although the device is comparable to commercial electric motors
or electric generators, there is a significant difference in their working
principles. Usually in an electric motor or generator the magnetic field causes
the driving force, while in a LFM or LFEG the Coulomb force is the driving
force. This fact is also interesting from the Bio-science point of view and
brings a similarity to bio motors. Here we have investigated the electrical
characteristics of such a generator for the first time experimentally and

describes the development and application of matrix factorizations for

sequences. The matrix factorization model allows the user to home in on and
display interesting, underlying structure and its evolution over time. The
methods are scalable to weighted networks with a large number of time points or
nodes, and can accommodate sudden changes to graph topology. Our techniques are
demonstrated with several dynamic graph series from both synthetic and real

how users can steer the techniques and combine them with existing methods to
discover and display meaningful patterns in sizable graphs over many time

the gates into the bipolar $npn$ doping regime, as the ON state in the near

because the switching involves a transmission gap instead of a structural
band-gap that would reduce the number of available channels of conduction.

a subthermal turn-on that beats the Landauer bound on switching energy limiting

derived algebraic geometry to deduce general fixed point and character
formulas. The formalism of dimension (or Hochschild homology) of a dualizable
object in the context of higher algebra provides a unifying framework for
classical notions such as Euler characteristics, Chern characters, and
characters of group representations. Moreover, the simple functoriality
properties of dimensions clarify celebrated identities and extend them to new
contexts.
  We observe that it is advantageous to calculate dimensions, traces and their
functoriality directly in the nonlinear geometric setting of correspondence
categories, where they are directly identified with (derived versions of) loop
spaces, fixed point loci and loop maps, respectively. This results in universal
nonlinear versions of Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorems, Atiyah-Bott-Lefschetz
trace formulas, and Frobenius-Weyl character formulas. On the one hand, we can
then linearize by applying sheaf theories, such as the theories of coherent
sheaves and D-modules, developed by Gaitsgory and Rozenblyum, as functors out
of correspondence categories (in the spirit of topological field theory). This
recovers the familiar classical identities, in families and without any
smoothness or transversality assumptions. On the other hand, the formalism also
applies to higher categorical settings not captured within a linear framework,
such as characters of group actions on categories.

objects and provides clues to the history of volatiles in the inner solar
system. We search the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) survey to derive upper
limits on the population size of active main-belt comets (MBCs). From data
collected March 2009 through July 2012, we extracted 2 million observations of
220 thousand known main-belt objects (40% of the known population, down to 1-km
diameter) and discovered 626 new objects in multi-night linked detections. We
formally quantify the extendedness of a small-body observation, account for
systematic variation in this metric (e.g., due to on-sky motion) and evaluate
this method's robustness in identifying cometary activity using observations of
115 comets, including two known candidate MBCs and six newly-discovered
non-main-belt comets (two of which were originally designated as asteroids by
other surveys). We demonstrate a 66% detection efficiency with respect to the
extendedness distribution of the 115 sampled comets, and a 100% detection
efficiency with respect to extendedness levels greater than or equal to those
we observed in the known candidate MBCs P/2010 R2 (La Sagra) and P/2006 VW139.
Using a log-constant prior, we infer 95% confidence upper limits of 33 and 22
active MBCs (per million main-belt asteroids down to 1-km diameter), for
detection efficiencies of 66% and 100%, respectively. In a follow-up to this
morphological search, we will perform a photometric (disk-integrated
brightening) search for MBCs.

Setting the order of the R\'enyi entropy q to one, it reduces to the

the scaling dimension of twist operators.

Comparatively less work has been devoted to the study of transformations of

time-spans by using a subgroup of the affine group in one dimension. In our
previous work, the work of Lewin has been included in the more general

generalizations have a categorical background in free monoidal categories
generated by a group-as-category. In particular, symmetric monoidal categories
allow to deal with the possible interexchanges between timelines. We also show
that more general time-spans can be considered, in which single time-spans are
encapsulated in a ""bracket"" of time-spans, which allows for the description of
complex rhythms.

backgrounds in rapidly adapting populations has a striking impact on
evolutionary dynamics. This effect, known as clonal interference, causes
erratic fluctuations in the frequencies of observed mutations, randomizes the
fixation times of successful mutations, and leaves distinct signatures on
patterns of genetic variation. Here, we show how this form of `genetic draft'
affects the forward-time dynamics of site frequencies in rapidly adapting
asexual populations. We calculate the probability that mutations at individual
sites shift in frequency over a characteristic timescale, extending Gillespie's
original model of draft to the case where many strongly selected beneficial
mutations segregate simultaneously. We then derive the sojourn time of mutant
alleles, the expected fixation time of successful mutants, and the site
frequency spectrum of beneficial and neutral mutations. We show how this form
of draft affects inferences in the McDonald-Kreitman test, and how it relates
to recent observations that some aspects of genetic diversity are described by
the Bolthausen-Sznitman coalescent in the limit of very rapid adaptation.
Finally, we describe how our method can be extended to model evolution on
fitness landscapes that include some forms of epistasis, such as landscapes
that are partitioned into two or more incompatible evolutionary trajectories.

with realistic equations of state (EoS) within the Cowling approximation. We
derive improved empirical relations for gravitational wave asteroseismology
with f-modes and for the first time we consider not only quadrupolar
oscillations but also modes with higher spherical order (l=|m|=3,4). After
performing a systematic comparison with polytropic EoS, it is shown that the
empirical relations found in this case approximately also hold for realistic
EoS. Even more, we show that these relations will not change significantly even
if the Cowling approximation is dropped and the full general relativistic case
is considered, although the normalization used here(frequencies and damping
times in the nonrotating limit) could differ considerably. We also address the
inverse problem, i.e. we investigate in detail what kind of observational data
is required in order to determine characteristical neutron star parameters. It
is shown that masses, radii and rotation rates can be estimated quite
accurately using the derived asteroseismology relations. We also compute the
instability window for certain models, i.e. the limiting curve in a
T-\Omega-plane where the secular Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz(CFS) instability
overcomes dissipative effects, and show that some of the modern realistic EoS
will lead to a larger instability window compared to all of the polytropic ones
presented so far in the literature. Additionally, we calculate the r-mode
instability window and compare it with the f-mode-case. The overall results for
the instability window suggest that it is vital to take into account
oscillations with l=3,4 when considering gravitational wave asteroseismology
using the f-mode in rapidly rotating neutron stars, as these modes can become
CFS unstable for a much larger range of parameters than pure quadrupolar
oscillations.

notion of projective non-Abelian statistics for them. The critical phenomena
between topologically distinct gapped boundaries can be understood in terms of
a general class of quantum spin chains or, equivalently, ""generalized

When the conductivity is bounded in $L^1$ and the constant of the

$\ep^{-2}$, the first Bloch eigenvalue converges as $\ep\to 0$ to a limit which
preserves the second-order expansion with respect to the Bloch parameter. In
dimension two the expansion of the limit can be improved until the fourth-order
under the same hypotheses. On the contrary, in dimension three a fibers
reinforced medium combined with a $L^1$-unbounded conductivity leads us to a
discontinuity of the limit first Bloch eigenvalue as the Bloch parameter tends
to zero but remains not orthogonal to the direction of the fibers. Therefore,
the high contrast conductivity of the microstructure induces an anomalous

three-dimensional (3D) topological insulators (TIs). We consider the quantum
entanglement of spins by calculating the exchange energy. A gap is opened up at
the Fermi level between the valence and conduction bands in the absence of
doping when graphene as well as 3D TIs are irradiated with circularly-polarized
light. This energy band gap is dependent on the intensity and frequency of the
applied electromagnetic field. The electron-photon coupling also gives rise to
a unique energy dispersion of the dressed states which is different from either
graphene or the conventional two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). In our
calculations, we obtained the dynamical polarization function for imaginary
frequencies which is then employed to determine the exchange energy. The
polarization function is obtained with the use of both the energy eigenstates
and the overlap of pseudo-spin wave functions. We have concluded that while
doping has a significant influence on the exchange energy and consequently on
the entanglement, the gap of the energy dispersions affects the exchange
slightly, which could be used as a good technique to tune and control
entanglement for quantum information purposes.

condensed matter for many years. An example is superfluid $^3$He-B, where the
broken symmetry leads to 4 Goldstone modes and at least 14 Higgs modes, which
are characterized by angular momentum quantum number $J$ and parity. Based on
the relation $E_{J+}^2+E_{J-}^2=4\Delta^2$ for the energy spectrum of these
modes, Yoichiro Nambu proposed the general sum rule, which relates masses of
Higgs bosons and masses of fermions. If this rule is applicable to Standard
Model, one may expect that the observed Higgs boson with mass $M_{{\rm
H}1}=125$ GeV has a Nambu partner -- the second Higgs boson with mass $M_{{\rm
H}2}=325$ GeV. Together they satisfy the Nambu relation $M_{{\rm H}1}^2 +
M_{{\rm H}2}^2 = 4 M_{\rm top}^2$, where $M_{\rm top}$ is the top quark mass.
Also the properties of the Higgs modes in superfluid $^3$He-A, where the
symmetry breaking is similar to that of the Standard Model, suggest the
possible existence of two electrically charged Higgs particles with masses
$M_{{\rm H}+}=M_{{\rm H}-}\sim 245$ GeV, which together obey the Nambu rule
$M_{{\rm H}+}^2 + M_{{\rm H}-}^2 = 4 M_{\rm top}^2$. A certain excess of events
at 325 GeV and at 245 GeV has been reported in 2011, though not confirmed in
2012 experiments. Besides, we consider the particular relativistic model of top
- quark condensation that suggests the possibility that two twice degenerated
Higgs bosons contribute to the Nambu sum rule. This gives the mass around 210
GeV for the Nambu partner of the 125 GeV Higgs boson. We also discuss the other
possible lessons from the condensed matter to Standard Model, such as hidden
symmetry, where light Higgs emerges as quasi Nambu-Goldstone mode, and the role
of broken time reversal symmetry.

best fit to the Coma central region underestimates the rotation measure in the

conclude that an amplification of the magnetic field along the South-West

disk that has been resolved in scattered light. We observed the HD32297 debris
disk in the far-infrared and sub-millimeter with the Herschel Space Observatory
PACS and SPIRE instruments, populating the spectral energy distribution (SED)
from 63 to 500{\mu}m. We aimed to determine the composition of dust grains in
the HD32297 disk through SED modeling, using geometrical constraints from the
resolved imaging to break degeneracies inherent in SED modeling. We found the
best fitting SED model has 2 components: an outer ring centered around 110 AU,
seen in the scattered light images, and an inner disk near the habitable zone
of the star. The outer disk appears to be composed of grains > 2{\mu}m
consisting of silicates, carbonaceous material, and water ice with an abundance
ratio of 1:2:3 respectively and 90% porosity. These grains appear consistent
with cometary grains, implying the underlying planetesimal population is
dominated by comet-like bodies. We also discuss the 3.7{\sigma} detection of [C
II] emission at 158{\mu}m with the Herschel PACS Spectrometer, making HD32297
one of only a handful of debris disks with circumstellar gas detected.

well as metallicity-dependent yields and a reformulation of the associated

of this new implementation with data on a) local, star-forming galaxies, b)
Milky Way disc G dwarfs, and c) local, elliptical galaxies. We find that the
z=0 gas-phase mass-metallicity relation is very well reproduced for all forms
of DTD considered, as is the [Fe/H] distribution in the Milky Way disc. The
[O/Fe] distribution in the Milky Way disc is best reproduced when using a DTD
with less than or equal to 50 per cent of SNe-Ia exploding within ~400 Myrs.
Positive slopes in the mass-[alpha/Fe] relations of local ellipticals are also
obtained when using a DTD with such a minor `prompt' component. Alternatively,
metal-rich winds that drive light alpha elements directly out into the
circumgalactic medium also produce positive slopes for all forms of DTD and
SN-II yields considered. Overall, we find that the best model for matching the
wide range of observational data considered here should include a power-law
SN-Ia DTD, SN-II yields that take account of prior mass loss through stellar
winds, and some direct ejection of light alpha elements out of galaxies.

the mechanism and efficiency of angular momentum transport as well as the level
of turbulence in protoplanetary disks (PPDs), which are key to understanding
PPD evolution and planet formation. It was shown in our previous work that at 1
AU, the magnetorotational instability (MRI) is completely suppressed when both
Ohmic resistivity and ambipolar diffusion (AD) are taken into account,
resulting in a laminar flow with accretion driven by magnetocentrifugal wind.
In this work, we study the radial dependence of the laminar wind solution using
local shearing-box simulations. Scaling relation on the angular momentum
transport for the laminar wind is obtained, and we find that the wind-driven
accretion rate can be approximated as
M_dot~0.91x10^(-8)R_AU^(1.21)(B_z/10mG)^(0.93)M_Sun/yr, where B_z is the
strength of the large-scale vertical magnetic field threading the disk. The
result is independent of disk surface density. Four criteria are outlined for
the existence of the laminar wind solution: 1). Ohmic resistivity dominated
midplane region; 2). AD dominated disk upper layer; 3). Presence of (not too
weak) net vertical magnetic flux. 4). Sufficiently well ionized gas beyond disk
surface. All these criteria are likely to be met in the inner region of the
disk from ~0.3 AU to about 5-10 AU for typical PPD accretion rates. Beyond this
radius, angular momentum transport is likely to proceed due to a combination of
the MRI and disk wind, and eventually dominated by the MRI (in the presence of
strong AD) in the outer disk. Our simulation results provide key ingredients
for a new paradigm on the accretion processes in PPDs.

finite momentum pairing and internodal BCS superconductivity are allowed. For
local attractive interaction the finite momentum pairing state with chiral
p-wave symmetry is found to be most favorable at finite chemical potential. The

evaluate the effectiveness of this technique to identify obscured AGN missed in
X-ray surveys. To do so we study the WISE properties of AGN independently
selected in hard X-ray and optical surveys. We use the largest catalogue of 887
[O III]{\lambda}5007-selected type 2 quasars (QSO2s) at z<0.83 in the
literature from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and the 258 hard (>4.5 keV)
X-ray-selected AGN from the Bright Ultrahard XMM-Newton Survey (BUXS). The
fraction of SDSS QSO2s in our infrared AGN selection region (wedge) increases
with the AGN luminosity, reaching 66.1+4.5_4.7% at the highest [O III]
luminosities in the sample. This fraction is substantially lower than for the
BUXS type 1 AGN (96.1+3.0_6.3%), but consistent, within the uncertainties, with
that for the BUXS type 2 AGN (75.0+14.1_19.1%) with the same luminosity. The
SDSS QSO2s appear to reside in more luminous (massive) hosts than the BUXS AGN,
due to the tight magnitude limits applied in the SDSS spectroscopic target
selection. Since host galaxy dilution can reduce substantially the
effectiveness of MIR-based techniques, this may explain the lower fraction of
SDSS QSO2s in the WISE AGN wedge. The fraction of SDSS QSO2s identified as
Compton-thick candidates that fall in the wedge is consistent with the fraction
of all SDSS QSO2s in that zone. At the AGN luminosities involved in the
comparison, Compton-thick and Compton-thin SDSS QSO2s have similar WISE colour
distributions. We conclude that at high luminosities and z<1 our MIR technique
is very effective at identifying both Compton-thin and Compton-thick AGN.

ambient medium and with the extreme gravitational field of the supermassive
black hole in the Galactic Center must be taken into account for such a source
scenario. The thermal pressure of the hot and dense atmosphere confines the
wind, while its ram pressure shapes it via stripping along the orbit, with the
details depending on the wind parameters. Tidal forces squeeze the wind near
pericenter, reducing it to a thin and elongated filament. We also find that in
this scenario most of the Br\gamma\ luminosity is expected to come from the
densest part of the wind, which has a highly filamentary structure with low
filling factor. The observations can be best matched by a mass outflow rate of
Mdot,w=8.8 x 10^{-8} Msun/yr and a wind velocity of vw = 50 km/s. These values
are compatible with those of a young T Tauri star wind, as already suggested by
(Scoville & Burkert 2013).

In the Spitzer 3.6micron and 4.5micron bands, we find that modeled SEDs
systematically over-predict observed luminosities by up to ~0.2 dex, depending
on treatment of the TP-AGB stars in the synthesis models. We assess the
reliability of UV luminosity as a SFR indicator, in light of independently
constrained SFHs. We find that fluctuations in the SFHs alone can cause factor
of ~2 variations in the UV luminosities relative to the assumption of a
constant SFH over the past 100 Myr. These variations are not strongly
correlated with UV-optical colors, implying that correcting UV-based SFRs for
the effects of realistic SFHs is difficult using only the broadband SED.
Additionally, for this diverse sample of galaxies, we find that stars older
than 100 Myr can contribute from <5% to100% of the present day UV luminosity,
highlighting the challenges in defining a characteristic star formation
timescale associated with UV emission. We do find a relationship between UV
emission timescale and broadband UV-optical color, though it is different than
predictions based on exponentially declining SFH models. Our findings have
significant implications for the comparison of UV-based SFRs across

to enable massive MIMO like gains and simplified system operations for
Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD) systems. The key idea lies in partitioning
the users into groups with approximately similar covariances, and use a two
stage downlink beamforming: a pre-beamformer that depends on the channel
covariances and minimizes interference across groups and a multiuser MIMO
precoder for the effective channel after pre-beamforming, to counteract
interference within a group. We first focus on the regime of a fixed number of
antennas and large number of users, and show that opportunistic beamforming
with user selection yields significant gain, and thus, channel correlation may
yield a capacity improvement over the uncorrelated ""isotropic"" channel result
of Sharif and Hassibi. We prove that in the presence of different correlations
among groups, a block diagonalization approach for the design of
pre-beamformers achieves the optimal sum-rate scaling. Next, we consider the
regime of large number of antennas and users, where user selection does not
provide significant gain. Here, we propose a simplified user grouping algorithm
to cluster users into groups when the number of antennas becomes very large, in
a realistic setting where users are randomly distributed and have different
angles of arrival and angular spreads depending on the propagation environment.
Our subsequent analysis leads to a probabilistic scheduling algorithm, where
users within each group are preselected at random based on probabilities
derived from the large system analysis, depending on the fairness criterion.
This is advantageous since only the selected users are required to feedback
their channel state information (CSIT).

electron temperature.
  This manuscript provides a kinetic description of APRS valid for all

of the probe with the plasma of its influence domain. In a first step, the
kinetic free energy of that domain is established which has a definite time
derivative with respect to the RF power. In the absence of RF excitation, it
assumes the properties of a Lyapunov functional; its minimum provides the
stable equilibrium of the plasma-probe system. Equipped with a scalar product
motivated by the second variation of the free energy, the set of all
perturbations of the equilibrium forms a Hilbert space. The dynamics of the
perturbations can be cast in an evolution equation in that space. The spectral
response function of the plasma-probe system consists of matrix elements of the
resolvent of the dynamical operator. An interpretation in terms of an
equivalent electric circuit model is given and the residual broadening of the
spectrum in the collisionless regime is explained.

noise from horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Compositional convergence is a
likely cause of controversy regarding phylogeny of the SAR11 group of
Alphaproteobacteria that have extremely streamlined, A+T-biased genomes. While
careful modeling can reduce artifacts caused by convergence, the most
consistent and robust phylogenetic signal in genomes may lie distributed among
encoded functional features that govern macromolecular interactions. Here we
develop a novel phyloclassification method based on signatures derived from
bioinformatically defined tRNA Class-Informative Features (CIFs). tRNA CIFs are
enriched for features that underlie tRNA-protein interactions. Using a simple
tRNA-CIF-based phyloclassifier, we obtained results consistent with those of
bias-corrected whole proteome phylogenomic studies, rejecting monophyly of
SAR11 and affiliating most strains with Rhizobiales with strong statistical
support. Yet SAR11 and Rickettsiales tRNA genes share distinct patterns of
A+T-richness, as expected from their elevated genomic A+T compositions. Using
conventional supermatrix methods on total tRNA sequence data, we could recover
the artifactual result of a monophyletic SAR11 grouping with Rickettsiales.
Thus tRNA CIF-based phyloclassification is more robust to base content
convergence than supermatrix phylogenomics on whole tRNA sequences. Also, given
the notoriously promiscuous HGT of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, tRNA CIF-based
phyloclassification may be relatively robust to HGT of network components. We
describe how unique features of tRNA-protein interaction networks facilitate
the mining of traits governing macromolecular interactions from genomic data,
and discuss why interaction-governing traits may be especially useful to solve
difficult problems in microbial classification and phylogeny.

Such extreme vortex flows are found systematically via numerical solution of

demonstrating that this analysis is in fact sharp. In the limit of small

for large palinstrophies they exhibit a self-similar multipolar structure. It
is also shown that the time evolution obtained using the instantaneously
optimal states with fixed energy and palinstrophy as the initial data saturates

standard model. We propose a novel method to measure top-quark polarization,
based on the charged lepton energy fraction in top-quark decay, and illustrate
the method with a detailed simulation of top-quark pairs produced in
supersymmetric top squark pair production. We show that the lepton energy ratio
distribution that we define is very sensitive to the top-quark polarization but
insensitive to the precise measurement of the top-quark energy.

the present amount of optical loss. Furthermore, our result proves that the
employed combination of a bright coherent state and a squeezed vacuum state is
generally the optimum practical approach for phase estimation with high

  solutions","99 pages. [v4:] Several minor corrections, and some longer proofs
  substantially simplified",,,,"math.FA math.AC math.CO math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Consider a compact Abelian group $Z$ and closed subgroups $U_1$, \ldots, $U_k
\leq Z$. Let $\mathbb{T} := \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$. This paper examines two
kinds of functional equation for measurable functions $Z\to \mathbb{T}$.
  First, given $f:Z\to \mathbb{T}$ and $w \in Z$, the resulting differenced
function is \[d_wf(z) := f(z-w) - f(z).\] In this notation, we study solutions
to the system of difference equations \[d_{u_1}\cdots d_{u_k}f \equiv 0 \quad
\forall u_1 \in U_1,\ u_2 \in U_2,\ \ldots\ u_k \in U_k.\] Second, we study
tuples of measurable functions $f_i:Z\to \mathbb{T}$ such that $f_i$ is
invariant under translation by $U_i$ and also \[f_1 + \cdots + f_k = 0.\]
  For these equations, the solutions form a subgroup of $\mathcal{F}(Z)$ or
$\mathcal{F}(Z)^k$, where $\mathcal{F}(Z)$ is the group of measurable functions
$Z\to \mathbb{T}$ modulo Haar-a.e. equality. The subgroup of solutions is
closed under convergence in probability and is globally invariant under
rotations of $Z$, so it is a complete metrizable $Z$-module. We will give a
recursive description of the structure of this $Z$-module relative to the
solution-modules of lower-order equations of the same kind.
  These results are obtained as applications of an abstract theory of a special
class of $Z$-modules. Most of our work will go into showing that this class of
modules is closed under various natural operations. Knowing that, the above
descriptions follow as easy consequences.
  Partial difference equations of the above kind can be seen as an extremal
version of the inverse problem for the higher-dimensional, directional analogs
of Gowers' uniformity norms. Our methods also give some information about the
`stability' version of this inverse problem, which concerns functions whose
Gowers norm is sufficiently close to being maximal.

is determined by how strongly it interacts with its environment. This
interaction entangles the quantum state with the inherent fluctuations of the
environment. If these fluctuations are not measured, the environment can be
viewed as a source of noise, causing random evolution of the quantum system
from an initially pure state into a statistical mixture-a process known as
decoherence. However, by accurately measuring the environment in real time, the
quantum system can be maintained in a pure state and its time evolution
described by a quantum trajectory conditioned on the measurement outcome. We
employ weak measurements to monitor a microwave cavity embedding a
superconducting qubit and track the individual quantum trajectories of the
system. In this architecture, the environment is dominated by the fluctuations
of a single electromagnetic mode of the cavity. Using a near-quantum-limited
parametric amplifier, we selectively measure either the phase or amplitude of
the cavity field, and thereby confine trajectories to either the equator or a
meridian of the Bloch sphere. We perform quantum state tomography at discrete
times along the trajectory to verify that we have faithfully tracked the state
of the quantum system as it diffuses on the surface of the Bloch sphere. Our
results demonstrate that decoherence can be mitigated by environmental
monitoring and validate the foundations of quantum feedback approaches based on
Bayesian statistics. Moreover, our experiments suggest a new route for
implementing what Schrodinger termed ""quantum steering""-harnessing action at a
distance to manipulate quantum states via measurement.

  Networks: A Lower Bound Analysis","11 pages, 6 figures, 1 table",,,,"cs.NI cs.MA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","  Accurate location information is essential for many wireless sensor network
(WSN) applications. A location-aware WSN generally includes two types of nodes:
sensors whose locations to be determined and anchors whose locations are known
a priori. For range-based localization, sensors' locations are deduced from
anchor-to-sensor and sensor-to-sensor range measurements. Localization accuracy
depends on the network parameters such as network connectivity and size. This
paper provides a generalized theory that quantitatively characterizes such
relation between network parameters and localization accuracy. We use the
average degree as a connectivity metric and use geometric dilution of precision
(DOP), equivalent to the Cramer-Rao bound, to quantify localization accuracy.
We prove a novel lower bound on expectation of average geometric DOP
(LB-E-AGDOP) and derives a closed-form formula that relates LB-E-AGDOP to only
three parameters: average anchor degree, average sensor degree, and number of
sensor nodes. The formula shows that localization accuracy is approximately
inversely proportional to the average degree, and a higher ratio of average
anchor degree to average sensor degree yields better localization accuracy.
Furthermore, the paper demonstrates a strong connection between LB-E-AGDOP and
the best achievable accuracy. Finally, we validate the theory via numerical
simulations with three different random graph models.

in the few-cycle limit may exhibit two independent curved wavefronts,
associated with phase and group retardations, respectively. Focusing optical
elements will generally affect these two wavefronts differently, thus leading
to very different behavior of the pulse near focus. As limiting cases, we
consider an ideal diffractive lens introducing only phase retardations and a
perfect non-dispersive refractive lens (or a curved mirror) introducing equal
phase and group retardations. We study the resulting diffraction effects on the
pulse, finding both strong deformations of the pulse shape and shifts in the
spectrum. We then show how important these effects can be in highly nonlinear
optics, by studying their role in attosecond pulse generation. In particular,
the focusing effects are found to affect substantially the generation of
isolated attosecond pulses in gases from few-cycle fundamental optical fields.

ITC approach for classification of a diverse set of 508 chemicals regarding
mutagenicity. A large number of topological indices (TIs), 3-dimensional, and
quantum chemical descriptors, as well as atom pairs (APs) have been used as
explanatory variables. In this paper, ITC has been used only for predictor
selection, after which ridge regression is employed to build the final
predictive model. The proper leave-one-out (LOO) method of cross-validation in
this scenario is to take as holdout each of the 508 compounds before predictor
thinning and compare the predicted values with the experimental data. ITC based
results obtained here are comparable to those developed earlier.

the phase space in f(R) gravity by compactifying the infinite phase space into
a finite space via the Poincare transformation. On the expansion branch of the
phase space, the constraint surface has a repeller and a de Sitter attractor;
while on the contraction branch, the constraint surface has an attractor and a
de Sitter repeller. Generally, the phase currents originate from the repeller
and terminate at the corresponding attractor in each space. The trajectories
between the repeller and the attractor in the presence of matter density are
different from those in the vacuum case. The phase analysis techniques
developed in this paper are very general, and can be applied to other similar

performance tracking is essential to its physics program including precision
Higgs studies. One of major challenges for a detector such as the proposed
International Large Detector (ILD) is to provide excellent momentum resolution
in a magnetic filed with small (but non-negligible) non-uniformity. The
non-uniform magnetic field implies deviation from a helical track and hence
requires the extension of a helical track model used for track fitting in a
uniform magnetic field. In this paper, a segment-wise helical track model is
introduced as such an extension. The segment-wise helical track model
approximates the magnetic field between two nearby measurement sites to be
uniform and steps between the two sites along a helix. The helix frame is then
transformed according to the new magnetic field direction for the next step, so
as to take into account the non-uniformity of the magnetic field. Details of
the algorithm and mathematical aspects of the segment-wise helical track model
in a Kalman-filter-based track fitting in the non-uniform magnetic field are
elaborated. The new track model is implemented and successfully tested in the
framework of the Kalman filter tracking software package, KalTest, which was
originally developed for tracking in a uniform magnetic field.

applications. The problem of hyperspectral unmixing has proven to be a
difficult task in unsupervised work settings where the endmembers and
abundances are both unknown. What is more, this task becomes more challenging
in the case that the spectral bands are degraded with noise. This paper
presents a robust model for unsupervised hyperspectral unmixing. Specifically,
our model is developed with the correntropy based metric where the non-negative
constraints on both endmembers and abundances are imposed to keep physical
significance. In addition, a sparsity prior is explicitly formulated to
constrain the distribution of the abundances of each endmember. To solve our
model, a half-quadratic optimization technique is developed to convert the
original complex optimization problem into an iteratively re-weighted NMF with
sparsity constraints. As a result, the optimization of our model can adaptively
assign small weights to noisy bands and give more emphasis on noise-free bands.
In addition, with sparsity constraints, our model can naturally generate sparse
abundances. Experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate the
effectiveness of our model in comparison to the related state-of-the-art
unmixing models.

fairness (i.e., fairness between all streams) thus sum-rate degradation is
milder. Algorithmic parameters can significantly differentiate the results of
numerical algorithms. A complete picture for comparison of algorithms can only
be depicted by varying these parameters. For example, a predetermined iteration
number or a negligible increment in the sum-rate can be the stopping criteria
of an algorithm. While the distributed interference alignment (DIA) can
reasonably achieve sub-stream fairness for the later, the imbalance between
sub-streams increases as the preset iteration number decreases. Thus comparison
of max-SINR and DIA with a low preset iteration number can only depict a part
of the picture. We analyze such important parameters and their effects on SINR

enhancement caused by moderate addition of gadolinium complexes. In this
manuscript, we first show experimentally that the nuclear steady state
polarization reached in solutions of pyruvic acid with 15 mM trityl radicals is
substantially independent from the average internuclear distance. This
evidences a leading role of electron (over nuclear) spin relaxation processes
in determining the ultimate performances of DNP. Accordingly, we have devised a
variant of the Thermal Mixing model for inhomogenously broadened electron
resonance lines which includes a relaxation term describing the exchange of
magnetic anisotropy energy of the electron spin system with the lattice. Thanks
to this additional term, the dependence of the nuclear polarization on the
electron concentration can be properly accounted for. Moreover, the model
predicts a strong increase of the final polarization on shortening the electron

importance for management. Levins-like models, in which local patches are
treated as either occupied or empty, have been used extensively for this
purpose, but they ignore the important role of local population dynamics. In
this paper, we consider a stochastic metapopulation model where local
populations follow a Ricker dynamics, and use this framework to investigate the
behaviour of the metapopulation at the brink of extinction. As long as
dispersal rates are not too large, the system is shown to have a time evolution
consistent with Levins' dynamics. We derive analytical expressions for the
colonisation and extinction rates (c and e) in Levins-type models in terms of
reproduction, survival, and dispersal parameters of the local populations,
providing an avenue to parameterising Levins-like models from the type of
information on local demography that is available for a number of species. To
facilitate applying our results, we provide a numerical implementation for
computing c and e.

equatorial plane of the Sun, but there is evidence that in extrasolar systems
the inclination can be very high. This spin-orbit misalignment is unexpected,
as planets form in a protoplanetary disc supposedly aligned with the stellar
spin. Planet-planet interactions are supposed to lead to a mutual inclination,
but the effects of the protoplanetary disc are still unknown. We investigate
therefore planet-disc interactions for planets above 1M_Jup. We check the
influence of the inclination i, eccentricity e, and mass M_p of the planet. We
perform 3D numerical simulations of protoplanetary discs with embedded
high-mass planets. We provide damping formulae for i and e as a function of i,
e, and M_p that fit the numerical data. For highly inclined massive planets,
the gap opening is reduced, and the damping of i occurs on time-scales of the
order of 10^-4 deg/yr M_disc/(0.01 M_star) with the damping of e on a smaller
time-scale. While the inclination of low planetary masses (<5M_Jup) is always
damped, large planetary masses with large i can undergo a Kozai-cycle with the
disc. These Kozai-cycles are damped in time. Eccentricity is generally damped,
except for very massive planets (M_p = 5M_Jup) where eccentricity can increase
for low inclinations. The dynamics tends to a final state: planets end up in
midplane and can then, over time, increase their eccentricity as a result of
interactions with the disc. The interactions with the disc lead to damping of i
and e after a scattering event of high-mass planets. If i is sufficiently
reduced, the eccentricity can be pumped up because of interactions with the
disc. If the planet is scattered to high inclination, it can undergo a
Kozai-cycle with the disc that makes it hard to predict the exact movement of
the planet and its orbital parameters at the dispersal of the disc.

strongly restricted by the admissible input power of the broadband

of these high-extinction polarization geometries with enhancement of the

sources of variation in data such as individual samples, multiple experimental
conditions, and multi-variable network-level responses. In multiparametric
cytometry, which is often used for analyzing patient samples, such issues are
critical. While computational methods can identify cell populations in
individual samples, without the ability to automatically match them across
samples, it is difficult to compare and characterize the populations in typical
experiments, such as those responding to various stimulations or distinctive of
particular patients or time-points, especially when there are many samples.
Joint Clustering and Matching (JCM) is a multi-level framework for simultaneous
modeling and registration of populations across a cohort. JCM models every
population with a robust multivariate probability distribution. Simultaneously,
JCM fits a random-effects model to construct an overall batch template -- used
for registering populations across samples, and classifying new samples. By
tackling systems-level variation, JCM supports practical biomedical
applications involving large cohorts.

beta-equilibrated nuclear matter is considered. We employ Quantum
Hadrodynamics, a relativistic field theory description of nuclear matter with
meson degrees of freedom, and include couplings between the baryon (proton and
neutron) magnetic dipole moment as well as between their charge and the
magnetic field in the Lagrangian density describing such a system. We vary the
strength of the baryon magnetic dipole moment till a non-zero value of the
magnetic field, for which the total energy density of the magnetised system is
at a minimum, is found. The system is then assumed to be in the ferromagnetic
state.
  The ferromagnetic equation of state is employed to study matter in the
neutron star interior. We find that as the density increases the ferromagnetic
field does not increase continuously, but exhibit sudden rapid increases. These
sudden increases in the magnetic field correspond to shifts between different
configurations of the charged particle's Landau levels and can have significant
observational consequences for neutron stars. We also found that although the
ferromagnetic phase softens the neutron star equation of state it does not
significantly alter the star's mass-radius relationship.
  The properties of magnetised symmetric nuclear matter were also studied. We
confirm that magnetised matter tends to be more proton-rich but become more
weakly bound for stronger magnetic fields. We show that the behaviour of the
compressibility of nuclear matter is influenced by the Landau quantisation and
tends to have an oscillatory character as it increases with the magnetic field.
The symmetry energy also exhibits similar behaviour.

envelope of the swept volume, that is the boundary of the volume obtained by
sweeping an input solid along a trajectory of rigid motions. Our framework is
adapted to the well-established industry-standard brep format to enable its
implementation in modern CAD systems. This is achieved via a ""local analysis"",
which covers parametrization and singularities, as well as a ""global theory""
which tackles face-boundaries, self-intersections and trim curves. Central to
the local analysis is the ""funnel"" which serves as a natural parameter space
for the basic surfaces constituting the sweep. The trimming problem is reduced
to the problem of surface-surface intersections of these basic surfaces. Based
on the complexity of these intersections, we introduce a novel classification
of sweeps as either decomposable or non-decomposable. Further, we construct an
{\em invariant} function $\theta$ on the funnel which efficiently separates
decomposable and non-decomposable sweeps. Through a geometric theorem we also
show intimate connections between $\theta$, local curvatures and the inverse
trajectory used in earlier works as an approach towards trimming. In contrast
to the inverse trajectory approach, $\theta$ is robust and is the key to a
complete structural understanding, and an efficient computation of both, the
singular locus and the trim curves, which are central to a stable
implementation. Several illustrative outputs of a pilot implementation are

ISM properties: dense extraplanar gas visible in CO, large linewidths (>= 50
km/s), strong mid-infrared H_2 line emission, low star formation activity, and
strong radio continuum emission. Gas-gas collisions can occur in the form of
ICM ram pressure stripping, galaxy head-on collisions, compression of the
intragroup gas and/or galaxy ISM by an intruder galaxy which flies through the
galaxy group at a high velocity, or external gas accretion on an existing gas
torus in a galactic center. We suggest that the common theme of all these
gas-gas interactions is adiabatic compression of the ISM leading to an increase
of the turbulent velocity dispersion of the gas. The turbulent gas clouds are
then overpressured and star formation is quenched. Within this scenario we
developed a model for turbulent clumpy gas disks where the energy to drive
turbulence is supplied by external infall or the gain of potential energy by
radial gas accretion within the disk. The cloud size is determined by the size
of a C-type shock propagating in dense molecular clouds with a low ionization
fraction at a given velocity dispersion. We give expressions for the expected
volume and area filling factors, mass, density, column density, and velocity
dispersion of the clouds. The latter is based on scaling relations of
intermittent turbulence whose open parameters are estimated for the CND in the
Galactic Center. The properties of the model gas clouds and the external mass
accretion rate necessary for the quenching of the star formation rate due to
adiabatic compression are consistent with those derived from high-resolution
H_2 line observations. Based on these findings, a scenario for the evolution of
gas tori in galactic centers is proposed and the implications for star
formation in the Galactic Center are discussed.

that the mass-radius relationship of the DM admixed neutron stars (DANSs)
depends sensitively on the mass of DM candidates, the amount of DM, and
interactions among DM candidates. The existence of DM in DANSs results in a
spread of mass-radius relationships that cannot be interpreted with a unique
equilibrium sequence. In some cases, the DM distribution can surpass the NM
distribution to form DM halo. In particular, it is favorable to form an
explicit DM halo, provided the repulsion of DM exists. It is interesting to
find that the difference in particle number density distributions in DANSs and
consequently in star radii caused by various density dependencies of nuclear
symmetry energy tends to disappear as long as the repulsion of accumulated DM
is sufficient. These phenomena indicate that the admixture of DM in neutron
stars can significantly affect the astrophysical extraction of nuclear equation
of state by virtue of neutron star measurements. In addition, the effect of the
DM admixture on the star maximum mass is also investigated.

the dynamical structure of their atmosphere. Lines asymmetry is used to derive
the center-of-mass velocity of the star, while a direct measurement of the
atmospheric velocity gradient helps determine the projection factor used in the
Baade-Wesselink method of distance determination. We aim at deriving the
center-of-mass velocity and the projection factor of the beta-Cephei star
alpha-Lup. We present HARPS high spectral resolution observations of alpha-Lup.
We calculate the first-moment radial velocities and fit the spectral line
profiles by a bi-Gaussian to derive line asymmetries. Correlations between the
gamma-velocity and the gamma-asymmetry (defined as the average values of the
radial velocity and line asymmetry curves respectively) are used to derive the
center-of-mass velocity of the star. By combining our spectroscopic
determination of the atmospheric velocity gradient with a hydrodynamical
modelof the photosphere of the star, we derive a semi-theoretical projection
factor for alpha Lup. We find a center-of-mass velocity of Vgamma = 7.9 +/- 0.6
km/s and that the velocity gradient in the atmosphere of alpha Lup isnull. We
apply to alpha Lup the usual decomposition of the projection factor into three
parts, p = p0 fgrad fog (originally developed for Cepheids), and derive a
projection factor of p = 1.43 +/-0.01. By comparing our results with previous

  design",,,,,"physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose: Stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM) diffusion MRI can be
advantageous over pulsed-gradient spin-echo (PGSE) for diffusion times that are
long compared to $\ttwo$. It is important therefore for biomedical diffusion
imaging applications at 7T and above where $\ttwo$ is short. However, imaging
gradients in the STEAM sequence contribute much greater diffusion weighting
than in PGSE, but are often ignored during post-processing. We demonstrate here
that this can severely bias parameter estimates.
  Method: We present models for the STEAM signal for free and restricted
diffusion that account for crusher and slice-select (butterfly) gradients to
avoid such bias. The butterfly gradients also disrupt experiment design,
typically by skewing gradient-vectors towards the slice direction. We propose a
simple compensation to the diffusion gradient vector specified to the scanner
that counterbalances the butterfly gradients to preserve the intended
experiment design.
  Results: High-field data fixed from a monkey brain experiments demonstrate
the need for both the compensation during acquisition and correct modelling
during post-processing for both diffusion tensor imaging and ActiveAx
axon-diameter index mapping. Simulations support the results and indicate a
similar need in in-vivo human applications.
  Conclusion: Correct modelling and compensation are important for practical
applications of STEAM diffusion MRI.

that is expected to emit thermal radiation in form of dileptons. These
dileptons are not affected by the strong force and are therefore a clean probe
for the possible creation of a Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP). However, electroweak
decays of open-charm mesons are expected to induce a substantial background in
the invariant mass region between the $\phi$ and $J/\Psi$ peak ($1\,\text{GeV}
\lesssim M_{\ell^+ \ell^-} \lesssim 3 \,\text{GeV}$) of the thermal QGP
radiation. To evaluate this background radiation we apply a Langevin approach
for the transport of charm quarks in the UrQMD (hydrodynamics + Boltzmann)
hybrid model. Due to the inclusion of event-by-event fluctuations and a full
(3+1)-dimensional hydrodynamic evolution, the UrQMD hybrid approach provides a
more realistic model for the evolution of the matter produced in heavy ion
collisions as compared to simple homogeneous fireball expansions usually
employed before. As drag and diffusion coefficients we use a resonance approach
for elastic heavy-quark scattering and assume a decoupling temperature of the
charm quarks from the hot medium of $130\,\text{MeV}$. For the hadronization of
the charm quarks we employ a coalescence approach at the decoupling temperature
from the medium. In this letter we present our calculations of the D-meson
correlations and the invariant mass spectra of the dilepton decays in heavy-ion
collisions at FAIR, RHIC, and LHC energies using different interaction
scenarios.

protection from wind and waves and thus coastal communities have been developed

Will these islands act as natural barriers ? Recent post-tsunami survey data,
supported by numerical simulations, reveal that the run-up on coastal areas
behind small islands was significantly higher than on neighboring locations not
affected by the presence of the island. To study the conditions of this run- up
amplification, we solve numerically the nonlinear shallow water equations
(NSWE). We use the simplified geometry of a conical island sitting on a flat
bed in front of a uniform sloping beach. By doing so, the experimental setup is
defined by five physical parameters, namely the island slope, the beach slope,
the water depth, the distance between the island and the plane beach and the
incoming wavelength, while the wave height was kept fixed. The objective is
twofold: Find the maximum run-up amplification with the least number of
simulations. To achieve this goal, we build an emulator based on Gaussian
Processes to guide the selection of the query points in the parameter space.

their early evolutionary history, we analyzed novel high-quality genome
sequences of three gray wolves, one from each of three putative centers of dog
domestication, two ancient dog lineages (Basenji and Dingo) and a golden jackal
as an outgroup. We find dogs and wolves diverged through a dynamic process
involving population bottlenecks in both lineages and post-divergence gene
flow, which confounds previous inferences of dog origins. In dogs, the
domestication bottleneck was severe involving a 17 to 49-fold reduction in
population size, a much stronger bottleneck than estimated previously from less
intensive sequencing efforts. A sharp bottleneck in wolves occurred soon after
their divergence from dogs, implying that the pool of diversity from which dogs
arose was far larger than represented by modern wolf populations. Conditional
on mutation rate, we narrow the plausible range for the date of initial dog
domestication to an interval from 11 to 16 thousand years ago. This period
predates the rise of agriculture, implying that the earliest dogs arose
alongside hunter-gathers rather than agriculturists. Regarding the geographic
origin of dogs, we find that surprisingly, none of the extant wolf lineages
from putative domestication centers are more closely related to dogs, and the
sampled wolves instead form a sister monophyletic clade. This result, in
combination with our finding of dog-wolf admixture during the process of
domestication, suggests a re-evaluation of past hypotheses of dog origin is
necessary. Finally, we also detect signatures of selection, including evidence
for selection on genes implicated in morphology, metabolism, and neural
development. Uniquely, we find support for selective sweeps at regulatory sites
suggesting gene regulatory changes played a critical role in dog domestication.

amplitudes (DAs) which are universal physical quantities in the high energy
processes involving hadron for applying pQCD to exclusive processes. Even for
the simplest pion, one can't discriminate from different DA models. Inversely,
one expects that processes involving pion can in principle provide strong
constraints on the pion DA. For example, the pion-photon transition form factor
(TFF) can get accurate information of the pion wave function or DA, due to the
single pion in this process. However, the data from Belle and BABAR have a big
difference on TFF in high $Q^2$ regions, at present, they are helpless for
determining the pion DA. At the present paper, we think it is still possible to
determine the pion DA as long as we perform a combined analysis of the most
existing data of the processes involving pion such as $\pi \to \mu \bar{\nu}$,
$\pi^0 \to \gamma \gamma$, $B\to \pi l \nu$, $D \to \pi l \nu$, and etc. Based
on the revised light-cone harmonic oscillator model, a convenient DA model has
been suggested, whose parameter $B$ which dominates its longitudinal behavior
for $\phi_{\pi}(x,\mu^2)$ can be determined in a definite range by those
processes. A light-cone sum rule analysis of the semi-leptonic processes $B \to
\pi l \nu$ and $D \to \pi l \nu$ leads to a narrow region $B = [0.01,0.14]$,
which indicate a slight deviation from the asymptotic DA. Then, one can predict
the behavior of the pion-photon TFF in high $Q^2$ regions which can be tested
in the future experiments. Following this way it provides the possibility that
the pion DA will be determined by the global fit finally.

manipulation is restricted to Local Operations assisted by Classical
Communication (LOCC). It is therefore of paramount importance to decide which
LOCC transformations are possible and, particularly, which states are maximally
useful under this restriction. While the bipartite maximally entangled state is
well known (it is the only state that cannot be obtained from any other and, at
the same time, it can be transformed to any other by LOCC), no such state
exists in the multipartite case. In order to cope with this fact, we introduce
here the notion of the Maximally Entangled Set (MES) of n-partite states. This
is the set of states which are maximally useful under LOCC manipulation, i.e.
any state outside of this set can be obtained via LOCC from one of the states
within the set and no state in the set can be obtained from any other state via
LOCC. We determine the MES for states of three and four qubits and provide a
simple characterization for them. In both cases, infinitely many states are
required. However, while the MES is of measure zero for 3-qubit states, almost
all 4-qubit states are in the MES. This is because, in contrast to the 3-qubit
case, deterministic LOCC transformations are almost never possible among fully
entangled four-partite states. We determine the measure-zero subset of the MES
of LOCC convertible states. This is the only relevant class of states for
entanglement manipulation.

dynamically young, likely Type Ia SNR. A long (980 ks) Chandra observation in
2011 allowed spatially-resolved spectroscopy of heavy-element ejecta. We
denoised Chandra data with the spatio-spectral method of Krishnamurthy et al.,
and used a wavelet-based technique to spatially localize thermal emission
produced by intermediate-mass elements (IMEs: Si and S) and iron. The spatial
distribution of both IMEs and Fe is extremely asymmetric, with the strongest
ejecta emission in the northern rim. Fe Kalpha emission is particularly
prominent there, and fits with thermal models indicate strongly oversolar Fe
abundances. In a localized, outlying region in the northern rim, IMEs are less
abundant than Fe, indicating that undiluted Fe-group elements (including 56Ni)
with velocities larger than 18,000 km/s were ejected by this SN. But in the
inner west rim, we find Si- and S-rich ejecta without any traces of Fe, so
high-velocity products of O-burning were also ejected. G1.9+0.3 appears similar
to energetic Type Ia SNe such as SN 2010jn where iron-group elements at such
high free-expansion velocities have been recently detected. The pronounced
asymmetry in the ejecta distribution and abundance inhomogeneities are best
explained by a strongly asymmetric SN explosion, similar to those produced in
some recent 3D delayed-detonation Type Ia models.

While
a basic understanding of the most simple systems in question (i.e. bipartite
systems) has been established over the past few decades, multipartite
entanglement still holds many unsolved questions and intriguing riddles. In
particular, it is completely unclear how several concepts from the bipartite
case can be generalised in a meaningful way to multipartite scenarios. In this
work, the main issues of multipartite entanglement detection, characterisation
and classification are discussed. The differences and similarities between the
bipartite and the multipartite situation are reviewed, various possible
generalisations are presented and results are obtained in several areas. The
focus of this work particularly lies on a formalism - the so called HMGH
framework, which has been developed and expanded for the past several years -
which allows for construction of very specific separability criteria, capable
of discriminating between different kinds of multipartite entanglement. By
means of these criteria, the questions of partial separability, genuine
multipartite entanglement and - ultimately - multipartite entanglement
classification (which appear to contain the most striking differences to
bipartite entanglement) are adressed and discussed. In order to illustrate the
theoretical conclusions in these respects, several examples are given from
different (and differently closely related) fields, showing the capabilities,
strengths and weaknesses of the HMGH framework as well as giving insights into
the current status of research in multipartite entanglement theory as a whole.

systems that increases in difficulty proportional to the size of the system.
The need for robust monitoring tools has become more evident with the advent of
cloud computing. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) clouds allow end users to
deploy vast numbers of virtual machines as part of dynamic and transient
architectures. Current monitoring solutions, including many of those in the
open-source domain rely on outdated concepts including manual deployment and
configuration, centralised data collection and adapt poorly to membership
churn.
  In this paper we propose the development of a cloud monitoring suite to
provide scalable and robust lookup, data collection and analysis services for
large-scale cloud systems. In lieu of centrally managed monitoring we propose a
multi-tier architecture using a layered gossip protocol to aggregate monitoring
information and facilitate lookup, information collection and the
identification of redundant capacity. This allows for a resource aware data
collection and storage architecture that operates over the system being
monitored. This in turn enables monitoring to be done in-situ without the need
for significant additional infrastructure to facilitate monitoring services. We
evaluate this approach against alternative monitoring paradigms and demonstrate
how our solution is well adapted to usage in a cloud-computing context.

  regression framework",,,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stochastic simulators such as Monte-Carlo estimators are widely used in
science and engineering to study physical systems through their probabilistic
representation. Global sensitivity analysis aims to identify the input
parameters which have the most important impact on the output. A popular tool
to perform global sensitivity analysis is the variance-based method which comes
from the Hoeffding-Sobol decomposition. Nevertheless, this method requires an
important number of simulations and is often unfeasible under reasonable time
constraint. Therefore, an approximation of the input/output relation of the
code is built with a Gaussian process regression model. This paper provides
conditions which ensure the asymptotic normality of a Sobol's index estimator
evaluated through this surrogate model. This result allows for building
asymptotic confidence intervals for the considered Sobol index estimator. The
presented method is successfully applied on an academic example on the heat
equation.

open horizontal tubes with smooth walls is revisited. It is proved that in long
tubes, this process can be considered quasi-steady, and an equation for the
flame front position is derived using the on-shell description. Numerical
solutions of this equation are found which show that as in the case of uniform
flame movement, there are two essentially different regimes of flame
propagation. In the type I regime, the flame speed and its acceleration are
comparatively low, whereas the type II regime is characterized by significant
flame acceleration that rapidly increases as the flame travels along the tube.
A detailed comparison of the obtained results with the experimental data on
flame acceleration in methane-air mixtures is given. In particular, it is
confirmed that flames propagating in near-stoichiometric mixtures and mixtures
near the limits of inflammability belong to the types II and I, respectively,
whereas flames in transient mixtures undergo transitions between the two
regimes during their travel.

over all cases. The latter one can provide a complete proof based on
abstractions of unbounded network. However, it usually needs user intervention

effects of these motions, on magnetohydrodynamic wave excitation from broadband
photospheric drivers. Numerical experiments of linear magnetohydrodynamic wave
propagation in a magnetic flux tube embedded in a realistic gravitationally
stratified solar atmosphere between the photosphere and the low choromosphere
(above $\beta=1$) are performed. Horizontal and vertical velocity field drivers
mimic granular buffeting and solar global oscillations. A uniform torsional
driver as well as Archimedean and logarithmic spiral drivers mimic observed
torsional motions in the solar photosphere. The results are analysed using a
novel method for extracting the parallel, perpendicular and azimuthal
components of the perturbations, which caters for both the linear and
non-linear case. Employing this method yields the identification of the wave
modes excited in the numerical simulations and enables a comparison of excited
modes via velocity perturbations and wave energy flux. The wave energy flux
distribution is calculated, to enable the quantification of the relative
strengths of excited modes. The torsional drivers excite primarily Alfv\'en
modes (~60% of the total flux) with small contributions from the slow kink
mode, and, for the logarithmic spiral driver, small amounts of slow sausage
mode. The horizontal and vertical drivers excite primarily slow kink or fast
sausage modes respectively, with small variations dependent upon flux surface
radius.

is introduced following the same idea of a scalar curvaton, which must not
affect the inflationary dynamics since its energy density during inflation is
negligible compared to the total energy density in the Universe. Using this
hypothesis, the vector curvaton will be solely responsible for generating the
primordial curvature perturbation \zeta. We have found that the spectra of the
vector field perturbations are scale-invariant in superhorizon scales due to
the suitable choice of the time dependence of the kinetic function and the
effective mass during inflation. The preferred direction, generated by the
vector field, makes the spectrum of \zeta depend on the wavevector, i.e. there
exists statistical anisotropy in \zeta. This is discussed principally in the
case where the mass of the vector field increases with time during inflation,
where it is possible to find a heavy field (M >> H) at the end of inflation,
making the particle production be practically isotropic; thus, the longitudinal
and transverse spectra are nearly the same order which in turn causes that the
statistical anisotropy generated by the vector field is within the

on the variation of electrical and other properties. Detailed introduction to
sensing methods based on electrical variation is discussed through further

Methods based on other kinds of variations such as optical, calorimetric,

control of packet-forwarding switches to a set of software controllers. The
most fundamental task of these controllers is the correct implementation of the
\emph{network policy}, i.e., the intended network behavior. In essence, such a
policy specifies the rules by which packets must be forwarded across the
network.
  This paper studies a distributed SDN control plane that enables
\emph{concurrent} and \emph{robust} policy implementation. We introduce a
formal model describing the interaction between the data plane and a
distributed control plane (consisting of a collection of fault-prone
controllers). Then we formulate the problem of \emph{consistent} composition of
concurrent network policy updates (short: the \emph{CPC Problem}). To
anticipate scenarios in which some conflicting policy updates must be rejected,
we enable the composition via a natural \emph{transactional} interface with
all-or-nothing semantics.
  We show that the ability of an $f$-resilient distributed control plane to
process concurrent policy updates depends on the tag complexity, i. e., the
number of policy labels (a.k.a. \emph{tags}) available to the controllers, and
describe a CPC protocol with optimal tag complexity $f+2$.

smaller gain than this amount. This means that, in principle, the system lacks

configurations where a particular value of the gain coefficient yields an
effective excitation of two distant SGMs. This induces lasing at two different

the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is a key step towards a full exploitation
of the scientific potential of this probe. In the context of pseudo-spectrum
methods the major challenge is related to a contamination of the B-mode
spectrum estimate with residual power of much larger E-mode. This so-called
E-to-B leakage is unavoidably present whenever an incomplete sky map is only
available, as is the case for any realistic observation. The leakage has to be
then minimized or removed and ideally in such a way that neither a bias nor
extra variance is introduced. In this paper, we compare from these two
perspectives three different methods proposed recently in this context Refs.
Smith 2006, Zhao & Baskaran 2010, Kim & Naselsky 2010, which we first introduce
within a common algebraic framework of the so-called chi-fields and then study
their performance on two different experimental configurations - one
corresponding to a small-scale experiment covering 1% of the sky motivated by
current ground-based or balloon-borne experiments and another - to a nearly
full-sky experiment, e.g., a possible CMB B-mode satellite mission. We find
that though all these methods allow to reduce significantly the level of the
E-to-B leakage, it is the method of Smith 2006, which at the same time ensures
the smallest error bars in all experimental configurations studied here, owing
to the fact that it permits straightforwardly for an optimization of the sky
apodization of the polarization maps used for the estimation. For a
satellite-like experiment, this method enables a detection of B-mode power
spectrum at large angular scales but only after appropriate binning. The method
of Zhao & Baskaran 2010 is a close runner-up in the case of a nearly full sky

  Experimental Evaluation of Algorithms for Steiner Tree on Tree Decompositions",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dynamic programming on tree decompositions is a frequently used approach to
solve otherwise intractable problems on instances of small treewidth. In recent
work by Bodlaender et al., it was shown that for many connectivity problems,
there exist algorithms that use time, linear in the number of vertices, and
single exponential in the width of the tree decomposition that is used. The
central idea is that it suffices to compute representative sets, and these can
be computed efficiently with help of Gaussian elimination.
  In this paper, we give an experimental evaluation of this technique for the
Steiner Tree problem. A comparison of the classic dynamic programming algorithm
and the improved dynamic programming algorithm that employs the table reduction
shows that the new approach gives significant improvements on the running time
of the algorithm and the size of the tables computed by the dynamic programming
algorithm, and thus that the rank based approach from Bodlaender et al. does
not only give significant theoretical improvements but also is a viable
approach in a practical setting, and showcases the potential of exploiting the
idea of representative sets for speeding up dynamic programming algorithms.

processes and is now being explored as a method for DNA/polymer sequencing and
detection. Although apparently simple in its scope, the study of ionic dynamics
in confined geometries has revealed interesting new phenomena that have an
almost one-to-one correspondence with the quantum regime. The picture that
emerges is that ions can form two `quasi-particle' states, one in which they
surround themselves with other ions of opposite charge - ionic atmosphere - and
one in which semi-bound water molecules form layers at different distances from
the ions - hydration layers. The second state gives rise to two additional
effects. In the first, which is a single quasi-particle effect, the ionic
conductance through a nanopore is predicted to be `quantized' as a function of
pore radius, with the corresponding `quantization units' not related to
universal constants - like the Plank constant and the elementary charge - but
rather to the radii of the hydration layers. The second effect instead involves
the many-body interaction among ionic quasi-particles of the same sign, and
occurs when the pore has a finite capacitance to accommodate ions so that there
is a threshold concentration beyond which ions of the same sign are not
energetically allowed to enter the pore. Similar to the electron transport
case, the ionic counterpart appears only in the `quantum' regime, when the
hydration layers forming the ionic quasi-particles need to break in order to
pass through the pore. Here, we review all these phenomena, and discuss the
conditions under which they may be detected making the analogy with the
electronic transport case. Since nanopores are being considered for a host of
technological applications in DNA sequencing and detection, we expect these
phenomena will become very relevant and their understanding paramount to
progress.

particles is effectively different from the standard one in General Relativity:
this is the case of coupled dark energy models, where dark matter particles
feel the presence of a fifth force, larger than gravity by a factor beta^2. We
investigate constraints on the strength of the coupling beta in view of Planck
data. Interestingly, we show that a non-zero coupling is compatible with data
and find a likelihood peak at beta = 0.036 \pm 0.016 (Planck + WP + BAO)
(compatible with zero at 2sigma). The significance of the peak increases to
beta = 0.066 \pm 0.018 (Planck + WP + HST) (around 3.6sigma) when Planck is
combined to Hubble Space Telescope data. This peak comes mostly from the small
difference between the Hubble parameter determined with CMB measurements and
the one coming from astrophysics measurements. In this sense, future
observations and further tests of current observations are needed to determine
whether the discrepancy is due to systematics in any of the datasets. Our aim
here is not to claim new physics but rather to show how Planck data can be used
to provide information on dynamical dark energy and modified gravity, allowing
us to test the strength of an effective fifth force between dark matter
particles with precision smaller than 2%.

300\,TeV) and a limited range in \tan \beta \simeq 1.7--2.5. Here we generalize
the theory to allow for non-universality in the Higgs soft masses. This
introduces zero, one or two new free parameters associated with Higgs soft
masses. This generalization allows us to greatly increase the allowed range in
\tan \beta and it allows one to find viable solutions with lower m_{3/2}. The
latter is important if we hope to find a low energy signal from gluinos. Some

dynamical instability of a spherically symmetric expansionfree gravitational
collapse. Darmois junction conditions are formulated by matching interior
spherically symmetric spacetime to exterior Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{o}$m
spacetime. We investigate the role of different terms in the dynamical equation
at Newtonian and post Newtonian regimes by using perturbation scheme. It is
concluded that instability range depends upon pressure anisotropy, radial
profile of energy density and electromagnetic field, but not on the adiabatic
index $\Gamma$. In particular, the electromagnetic field reduces the unstable
region.

  Local Energy Policy Design in the UK","Energy Policy 47, 102-110, 2012",,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper reviews major studies in three traditional lines of research in
residential energy consumption in the UK, i.e. economic/infrastructure,
behaviour, and load profiling. Based on the review the paper proposes a
three-dimensional model for archetyping residential energy consumers in the UK
by considering property energy efficiency levels, the greenness of household
behaviour of using energy, and the duration of property daytime occupancy. With
the proposed model, eight archetypes of residential energy consumers in the UK
have been identified. They are: pioneer greens, follower greens, concerned
greens, home stayers, unconscientious wasters, regular wasters, daytime
wasters, and disengaged wasters. Using a case study, these archetypes of
residential energy consumers demonstrate the robustness of the 3-D model in
aiding local energy policy/intervention design in the UK.

  pole. Rationals related to Dirichlet L-functions","25 pages",,,,"math.GM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We believe that Euler constant is not just the ""renormalized"" value of the
Riemann zeta function in 1. In a sense that we shall clarify it is in fact the
normal and natural value of zeta of 1. In this paper we first propose a limit
definition of a function whose values coincide everywhere with those of the
Riemann zeta function, save in 1, where our limit definition yields the Euler
constant. Since in the literature one can find more than one way to regularize
the value of the zeta function at s=1, we give asymptotic expansions where, by
dint of some extended analogies, Euler constant appears to be the true
""renormalized"" value. As a striking example of such analogies, we propose an
expansion of the logarithm function based on Euler constant and on all values
of the zeta function at odd positive integers, in which all these presumably
irrational numbers are accompanied by Harmonic numbers of corresponding orders.
The other aim of this paper is to show how sequences of rationals, often the
same, arise in computations related to Dirichlet L-functions. Here, a
connection with the Liouville lambda function appears to have been found. Thus
we raise the question about the possible usefulness of an extension of the
Liouville lambda function to rationals. .

hope arises that the properties of the minimal partial triangulations will be
very useful for the solution of the Four Color Problem. That is why the
material of this paper is devoted to the examination of the specific partial
graphs and their properties. Such graphs will have all the elements of the
planar triangulation, but will have the minimal size. And it will be quite
interesting to found out their properties in order to search in the sequel for
the possibility to prove the Four Color Problem on the base of their
characteristics.

Several laboratory experiments have established upper limits on the energy
associated with various fermion-spin orientations relative to the Earth. We
combine the results from three of these experiments with the geoelectron-spin
model to obtain bounds on the velocity-dependent interactions that couple
electron spin to the spins of electrons, neutrons and protons. Five of the six
possible potentials investigated were previously unbounded. The bound achieved
on V8 is about 30 orders of magnitude more restrictive in the long-range limit
than the only previously established constraint.

"1306.1166","Mark Burgin","Mark Burgin","Negative probability in the framework of combined probability",,,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Negative probability has found diverse applications in theoretical physics.
Thus, construction of sound and rigorous mathematical foundations for negative
probability is important for physics. There are different axiomatizations of
conventional probability. So, it is natural that negative probability also has
different axiomatic frameworks. In the previous publications (Burgin, 2009;
2010), negative probability was mathematically formalized and rigorously
interpreted in the context of extended probability. In this work, the axiomatic
system that synthesizes conventional probability and negative probability is
constructed in the form of combined probability. In a mathematically rigorous
way, both theoretical concepts - combined probability and extended probability
- stretch conventional probability so that it can takes negative values. After
introducing axioms for combined probability, we study its properties, as well
as relations to extended probability and conventional probability.

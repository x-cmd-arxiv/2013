The emissions of the three molecules show marked differences. The CO emission
near the systemic velocity is filtered out by the telescopes, and CO mostly
traces the high-velocity gas. The HCO+ and HCN emissions are more centrally

shell flash, but it has been suggested recently that it may instead have been
an ONe nova. The new images provide an 18 year baseline for the expansion of
the ejecta from the 1919 event. In addition, the central star has been directly
detected in the visible for the first time since 1923, when it faded from sight
due to obscuration by dust. The expansion of the ejecta has a velocity of ~200
km/s, and an angular expansion rate of ~10 mas/yr, consistent with a 1919
ejection. This implies a geometric distance of 4.6 kpc for V605 Aql, consistent
with previous estimates. The gas mass in the central knot of ejecta was
previously estimated to be 5 x 10^-5 M(Sun). It is estimated that warm dust
associated with this gas has a mass of ~10^-5 M(Sun). There is also evidence
for a significant amount, 10^-3 M(Sun), of cold (75 K) dust, which may be
associated with its PN. The knot ejected in 1919 is asymmetrical and is

cosmic abundance of lithium in the early universe. Combining the standard Big
Bang nucleosynthesis model with Galactic production through cosmic ray
spallation, these stars at [Fe/H]<-2 are expected to show an undetectably small
6Li/7Li isotopic signature. Evidence to the contrary may necessitate an
additional pre-galactic production source or a revision of the standard model
of Big Bang nucleosynthesis. We revisit the isotopic analysis of four halo
stars, two with claimed 6Li-detections in the literature, to investigate the
influence of improved model atmospheres and line formation treatment. For the
first time, a combined 3D, NLTE (non-local thermodynamic equilibrium) modelling
technique for Li, Na, and Ca lines is utilised to constrain the intrinsic
line-broadening and to determine the Li isotopic ratio. We discuss the
influence of 3D NLTE effects on line profile shapes and assess the realism of
our modelling using the Ca excitation and ionisation balance. By accounting for
NLTE line formation in realistic 3D hydrodynamical model atmospheres, we can
model the Li resonance line and other neutral lines with a consistency that is
superior to LTE, with no need for additional line asymmetry caused by the
presence of 6Li. Contrary to the results from 1D and 3D LTE modelling, no star
in our sample has a significant 2-sigma detection of the lighter isotope in
NLTE. Over a large parameter space, NLTE modelling systematically reduces the
best-fit Li isotopic ratios by up to five percentage points. As a bi-product,
we also present the first ever 3D NLTE Ca and Na abundances of halo stars,
which reveal significant departures from LTE. The observational support for a
significant and non-standard 6Li production source in the early universe is
substantially weakened by our findings.

generalisation of quantum theory in which it is postulated that the
configuration space path actually followed by a closed quantum system is
probabilistically chosen. This is done a postulate defining probabilities for
paths, which we propose are determined by an expression involving path
amplitudes and a distance function that quantifies path separation. We suggest
a possible form for a path probability postulate and explore possible choices
of distance function, including choices suitable for Lorentz or generally
covariant versions of real path quantum theory. We set out toy models of
quantum interferometry and show that in these models the probability postulate
and specific distance functions do indeed give a physically sensible path
ontology. These functions can be chosen so as to predict quantum interference
for interference of microscopic quantum systems and the failure of interference
for macroscopic quantum systems. More generally, they predict interference when
the beams are close, and its failure when they are far apart, as determined by
the distance function. If taken seriously in its present relatively
unconstrained form, real path quantum theory thus motivates experimental tests
of quantum interference in all unexplored regimes defined by potentially
physically interesting parameters, including the mass of the beam object, the
beam separation distance, the beam separation time, and many others. We discuss

so-called magnetically silent variants of atomic magnetometers have been
developed. While in conventional magnetometers the magnetic resonance
transitions between atomic sublevels are phase-coherently driven by a weak
oscillating magnetic field, silent magnetometers use schemes in which either
the frequency (FM) or the amplitude (AM) of the light beam is modulated. Here
we present a theoretical model that yields algebraic expressions for the
parameters of the multiple resonances that occur when either amplitude-,
frequency- or polarization-modulated light of circular polarization is used to
drive the magnetic resonance transition in a transverse magnetic field. The
relative magnitudes of the resonances that are observed in the transmitted
light intensity at harmonic m of the Larmor frequency \omega_L (either by DC or
phase sensitive detection at harmonics q of the modulation frequency

excellent quantitative agreement with an experimental case study using

minors is the Grid-Minor Theorem (also called the Excluded Grid Theorem). The
theorem states that for every grid $H$, every graph whose treewidth is large
enough relative to $|V(H)|$ contains $H$ as a minor. This theorem has found
many applications in graph theory and algorithms. Let $f(k)$ denote the largest
value such that every graph of treewidth $k$ contains a grid minor of size
$(f(k)\times f(k))$. The best previous quantitative bound, due to recent work
of Kawarabayashi and Kobayashi, and Leaf and Seymour, shows that
$f(k)=\Omega(\sqrt{\log k/\log \log k})$. In contrast, the best known upper
bound implies that $f(k) = O(\sqrt{k/\log k})$. In this paper we obtain the
first polynomial relationship between treewidth and grid minor size by showing
that $f(k)=\Omega(k^{\delta})$ for some fixed constant $\delta > 0$, and
describe a randomized algorithm, whose running time is polynomial in $|V(G)|$
and $k$, that with high probability finds a model of such a grid minor in $G$.

cooperators fixate the population and replace all defectors. We analytically

that are much larger than those permitted by the Courant-Friedrich-Lewy
criterion characterizing time-explicit methods. This advantage comes, however,
with a cost: the solution of a system of nonlinear equations is required at
each time step. In this work, the nonlinear system results from the
discretization of the hydrodynamical equations with the Crank-Nicholson scheme.
We compare the cost of different methods, based on Newton-Raphson iterations,
to solve this nonlinear system, and benchmark their performances against
time-explicit schemes. Since our general scientific objective is to model
stellar interiors, we use as test cases two realistic models for the convective
envelope of a red giant and a young Sun. Focusing on 2D simulations, we show
that the best performances are obtained with the quasi-Newton method proposed
by Broyden. Another important concern is the accuracy of implicit calculations.
Based on the study of an idealized problem, namely the advection of a single
vortex by a uniform flow, we show that there are two aspects: i) the nonlinear
solver has to be accurate enough to resolve the truncation error of the
numerical discretization, and ii) the time step has be small enough to resolve
the advection of eddies. We show that with these two conditions fulfilled, our
implicit methods exhibit similar accuracy to time-explicit schemes, which have
lower values for the time step and higher computational costs. Finally, we
discuss in the conclusion the applicability of these methods to fully implicit
3D calculations.

incompleteness resulting from point source confusion (i.e., crowding). An
artificial star addition and extraction analysis demonstrates that completeness
is strongly dependent on local background brightness and structure, with
high-surface-brightness regions suffering up to five magnitudes of reduced
sensitivity to point sources. This effect is most pronounced at the IRAC 5.8

determining spectroscopic stellar parameters. The independent log(g) value from
asteroseismology can be used as a fixed value in the spectroscopic analysis to
reduce uncertainties due to the fact that log(g) and effective temperature can
not be determined independently from spectra. Since 2012, a combined analysis
of seismically and spectroscopically derived stellar properties is ongoing for
a large survey with SDSS/APOGEE and Kepler. Therefore, knowledge of any
potential biases and uncertainties in asteroseismic log(g) values is now
becoming important. Aims: The seismic parameter needed to derive log(g) is the
frequency of maximum oscillation power (nu_max). Here, we investigate the
influence of nu_max derived with different methods on the derived log(g)
values. The large frequency separation between modes of the same degree and
consecutive radial orders (Dnu) is often used as an additional constraint for
the determination of log(g). Additionally, we checked the influence of small
corrections applied to Dnu on the derived values of log(g). Methods We use
methods extensively described in the literature to determine nu_max and Dnu
together with seismic scaling relations and grid-based modeling to derive
log(g). Results: We find that different approaches to derive oscillation
parameters give results for log(g) with small, but different, biases for
red-clump and red-giant-branch stars. These biases are well within the quoted
uncertainties of ~0.01 dex (cgs). Corrections suggested in the literature to
the Dnu scaling relation have no significant effect on log(g). However somewhat
unexpectedly, method specific solar reference values induce biases of the order
of the uncertainties, which is not the case when canonical solar reference
values are used.

the gamma-subunit to rotate within the ATP-producing complex (F1) overcoming,
with the aid of thermal fluctuations, an opposing torque that rises and falls
with angular position. Using the analogy with thermal Brownian motion of a

production, which scales inversely with the number of proton binding sites on

helical wavefronts, - could become a novel tool in the physics of
electromagnetic radiation. They carry a non-zero intrinsic orbital angular
momentum (OAM) $\ell$ with respect to the propagation axis and, for \ell \gg 1,
a large OAM-induced magnetic moment, \mu ~ \ell \mu_B (\mu_B is the Bohr
magneton), which influences the radiation of electromagnetic waves. Here, we
consider in detail the OAM-induced effects by such electrons in two forms of
polarization radiation, namely in Cherenkov radiation and transition radiation.
Thanks to the large \ell, we can neglect quantum or spin-induced effects, which
are of the order of \hbar \omega/E_e \ll 1, but retain the magnetic moment
contribution \ell \hbar \omega/E_e \lesssim 1, which makes the quasiclassical
approach to polarization radiation applicable. We discuss the magnetic moment
contribution to polarization radiation, which has never been experimentally
observed, and study how its visibility depends on the kinematical parameters
and the medium permittivity. In particular, it is shown that this contribution
can, in principle, be detected in azimuthally non-symmetrical problems, for
example when vortex electrons obliquely cross a metallic screen (transition
radiation) or move nearby it (diffraction radiation). We predict a left-right
angular asymmetry of the transition radiation (in the plane where the charge
radiation distributions would stay symmetric), which appears due to an
effective interference between the charge radiation field and the magnetic
moment one. Numerical values of this asymmetry for vortex electrons with E_e =
300keV and \ell = O(100-1000) are O(0.1-1%), and we argue that this effect
could be detected with existing technology. The finite conductivity of the
target and frequency dispersion play the crucial roles in these predictions.

consistent with previous results compiled with the larger sample. For the first
time it is shown that SNe Ibc are located in pairs with significantly smaller

luminosity ratio of host and neighbor galaxies in pairs. The orientation of SNe
with respect to the preferred direction toward neighbor galaxy is found to be
isotropic and independent of kinematical properties of the galaxy pair.

time-resolved measurements of the two spin impurities. The increased effective

to single magnon excitations. In our measurements, we also determine the decay
time of bound magnons, which is most likely limited by scattering on thermal

these sources lack prominent radio or X-ray counterparts, and so have been
considered promising sites for hadron acceleration within our Galaxy. Modeling
the TeV UnID sources as Galactic hypernova remnants, we predict Sub-PeV

spatial distribution of the Sub-PeV neutrinos and TeV UnID sources, which finds
that a best-fit of one, and maximum of 3.8 (at 90%-confidence), of the ~16

young (<120Myr) systems, with a ~1% occurrence rate. We show that a two
component in situ model where all stars have initially massive warm disks and
in which warm debris is also generated at some random time along the stars'
main-sequence lifetime, perhaps due to a collision, can explain the
observations. However, if all stars only have initially massive warm disks
these would not be visible at Gyr ages, and random collisions on the
main-sequence are too infrequent to explain the high disk occurrence rate for
young stars. That is, neither component can explain the observations on their
own. Despite these conclusions, we cannot rule out an alternative model in
which comets are scattered from outer regions because the distribution of
systems with the appropriate dynamics is unknown. Our in situ model predicts
the fraction of stars with exo-Zodi bright enough to cause problems for future
exo-Earth imaging attempts is at least ~10%, and is higher for populations of
stars younger than a few Gyr. This prediction of ~10% applies to old stars
because bright systems like BD+20 307 imply a population of fainter systems
that were once bright but are now decaying through fainter levels. Our
prediction should be strongly tested by the Large Binocular Telescope
Interferometer, providing valuable input for more detailed evolution models. A
detection fraction lower than our prediction could indicate that the hot dust
in systems like BD+20 307 has a cometary origin due to the quirks of the

covered by current electroweakino and fourth generation searches. If quadratic
divergences are canceled by terms bilinear in the Higgs field, then the
signatures are highly dependent on the quantum numbers of the new particles.
Precision Higgs measurements can reveal the presence of new particles with
either vevs or Standard Model charges. If the new particles are scalar dark
matter candidates, their direct and indirect detection signatures will be
highly correlated and within the reach of XENON100 and Fermi. Observation at
one of these experiments would imply observation at the other one. Observable
LHC decay channels can also arise if the new particles mix with lighter states.
This decay channel involves only the Higgs boson and not the gauge bosons.
Observation of such decays would give evidence that the new particle is tied to
the naturalness problem.

Nonetheless, it is important to examine the space of particle theories capable
of explaining this excess, to see what theories are capable of explaining it,

We examine a simplified model containing a scalar mediator particle, and find

invariants (i.e. constants of motion) in time-dependent gravitational
potentials. The method relies on the construction of a canonical transformation
that removes the explicit time-dependence from the Hamiltonian of the system.
By referring the phase-space locations of particles to a coordinate frame in
which the potential remains `static' the dynamical effects introduced by the
time evolution vanish. It follows that dynamical invariants correspond to the
integrals of motion for the static potential expressed in the transformed
coordinates. The main difficulty of the method reduces to solving the
differential equations that define the canonical transformation, which are
typically coupled with the equations of motion. We discuss a few examples where
both sets of equations can be exactly de-coupled, and cases that require
approximations. The construction of dynamical invariants has far-reaching
applications. These quantities allow us, for example, to describe the evolution
of (statistical) microcanonical ensembles in time-dependent gravitational
potentials without relying on ergodicity or probability assumptions. As an
illustration, we follow the evolution of dynamical fossils in galaxies that
build up mass hierarchically. It is shown that the growth of the host potential
tends to efface tidal substructures in the integral-of-motion space through an
orbital diffusion process. The inexorable cycle of deposition, and progressive
dissolution, of tidal clumps naturally leads to the formation of a `smooth'
stellar halo.

While the acceleration of electrons for injection into shock acceleration
processes to produce cosmic rays has received considerable attention, the
related problem of the shock heating of quasi-thermal electrons has been
relatively neglected. In this paper we review that state of our knowledge of
electron heating in astrophysical shocks, mainly associated with supernova
remnants (SNRs), shocks in the solar wind associated with the terrestrial and
Saturnian bowshocks, and galaxy cluster shocks. The solar wind and SNR samples
indicate that the ratio of electron temperature to ion temperature declines
with increasing shock speed or Alfvenic Mach number. We discuss the extent to
which such behavior can be understood via cosmic ray-generated waves in a shock
precursor, which then subsequently damp by heating electrons. Finally, we
speculate that a similar mechanism may be at work for both solar wind and SNR
shocks.

accurate dynamical description is provided by the third convention, in which
the particle experiences a drift originating from the dissipation instead of
the fluctuation term. This feature is directly related to the fact that the
drift is a result of an inertial effect that cannot be well understood in the

We introduce the concept of domain types, which classify the program variables
into types that are more fine-grained than standard declared types, such as int
or long, in order to guide the selection of an appropriate abstract domain for
a model checker. Our implementation determines the domain type for each
variable in a pre-processing step, based on the variable usage in the program,
and then assigns each variable to an abstract domain. The model-checking
framework that we use supports to specify a separate analysis precision for
each abstract domain, such that we can freely configure the analysis. We
experimentally demonstrate a significant impact of the choice of the abstract
domain per variable. We consider one explicit (hash tables for integer values)
and one symbolic (binary decision diagrams) domain. The experiments are based
on standard verification tasks that are taken from recent competitions on
software verification. Each abstract domain has unique advantages in
representing the state space of variables of a certain domain type. Our
experiments show that software model checkers can be improved with a
domain-type guided combination of abstract domains.

photoevaporative winds operate concurrently. Hence, disentangling their
relative contribution to disk dispersal requires identifying diagnostics that
trace different star-disk environments. Here, we analyze the low velocity
component (LVC) of the Oxygen optical forbidden lines, which is found to be
blueshifted by a few km/s with respect to the stellar velocity. We find that
the [OI] LVC profiles are different from those of [NeII] at 12.81\mu m and CO
at 4.7\mu m lines pointing to different origins for these gas lines. We report
a correlation between the luminosity of the [OI] LVC and the accretion
luminosity Lacc. We do not find any correlation with the X-ray luminosity,
while we find that the higher is the stellar FUV luminosity, the higher is the
luminosity of the [OI] LVC. In addition, we show that the [OI]6300\AA/5577\AA\
ratio is low (ranging between 1 and 8). These findings favor an origin of the
[OI] LVC in a region where OH is photodissociated by stellar FUV photons and
argue against thermal emission from an X-ray-heated layer. Detailed modeling of
two spectra with the highest S/N and resolution shows that there are two
components within the LVC: a broad, centrally peaked component that can be
attributed to gas arising in a warm disk surface in Keplerian rotation (with
FWHM between ~40 and ~60 km/s), and a narrow component (with FWHM ~10 km/s and
small blueshifts of ~2 km/s) that may arise in a cool (<1,000 K) molecular

points in a plane with assigned unit tangent vectors. The interpolation problem
is a system of three nonlinear equations with multiple solutions which is
difficult to solve also numerically. Here the solution of this system is
reduced to the computation of the zeros of one single function in one variable.
The location of the zero associated to the relevant solution is studied
analytically: the interval containing the zero where the solution is proved to
exists and to be unique is provided. A simple guess function allows to find
that zero with very few iterations in all possible configurations.
  The computation of the clothoid curves and the solution algorithm call for
the evaluation of Fresnel related integrals. Such integrals need asymptotic
expansions near critical values to avoid loss of precision. This is necessary
when, for example, the solution of the interpolation problem is close to a
straight line or an arc of circle. A simple algorithm is presented for
efficient computation of the asymptotic expansion.
  The reduction of the problem to a single nonlinear function in one variable
and the use of asymptotic expansions make the present solution algorithm fast
and robust. In particular a comparison with algorithms present in literature
shows that the present algorithm requires less iterations. Moreover accuracy is
maintained in all possible configurations while other algorithms have a loss of
accuracy near the transition zones.

on it) {\it pullback} space (action). In such general setting a negative answer
follows from a recent result of O. Baker and T. Riley [BR].
  Suppose, in addition, that the initial actions are relatively hyperbolic that
is they are non-parabolic and the induced action on the distinct pairs are
cocompact. Then the existence of the pullback space if $G$ is finitely
generated follows from \cite{Ge2}. The main result of the paper claims that the
pullback space exists if and only if the maximal parabolic subgroups of one of
the actions are dynamically quasiconvex for the other one.
  We provide an example of two relatively hyperbolic actions of the free group
$G$ of countable rank for which the pullback action does not exist.
  We study an analog of the notion of geodesic flow for relatively hyperbolic
groups. Further these results are used to prove the main theorem.

machine learning and computational neuroscience. An important but poorly
understood aspect of sensory processing is the role of active sensing. Here, we
present a Bayes-optimal inference and control framework for active sensing,
C-DAC (Context-Dependent Active Controller). Unlike previously proposed
algorithms that optimize abstract statistical objectives such as information
maximization (Infomax) [Butko & Movellan, 2010] or one-step look-ahead accuracy
[Najemnik & Geisler, 2005], our active sensing model directly minimizes a
combination of behavioral costs, such as temporal delay, response error, and
effort. We simulate these algorithms on a simple visual search task to
illustrate scenarios in which context-sensitivity is particularly beneficial
and optimization with respect to generic statistical objectives particularly
inadequate. Motivated by the geometric properties of the C-DAC policy, we
present both parametric and non-parametric approximations, which retain
context-sensitivity while significantly reducing computational complexity.
These approximations enable us to investigate the more complex problem
involving peripheral vision, and we notice that the difference between C-DAC
and statistical policies becomes even more evident in this scenario.

problem in the broken phase of the SM. In the broken phase a light Higgs turns
out to be natural as it appears self-protected and self-tuned by the
spontaneous symmetry breaking. It means that the scalar Higgs needs not be
protected by any extra symmetry, specifically super symmetry, in order not to
be much heavier than the other SM particles, which are protected by gauge- or
chiral-symmetry. Thus the existence of quadratic cutoff effects in the SM
cannot motivate the need for a super symmetric extensions of the SM, but in
contrast plays an important role in triggering the electroweak phase transition
at a scale about 10^{17} GeV and in shaping the Higgs potential in the early
universe to drive inflation as supported by observation. The impact on the
inflation profile of the quadratically enhanced bare Higgs mass term in the
unbroken phase is discussed in some detail. My analysis suggests that inflation
in the early universe is a direct consequence of the SM Higgs sector with its
quadratic enhancement of the bare Higgs mass term

employed to semi-discrete the fractional diffusion equations. This spatial
discretization can reduce to the large system of ordinary differential
equations (ODEs) with initial values. Recently, boundary value method (BVM) was
developed as a popular algorithm for solving large systems of ODEs. This method
requires the solutions of one or more nonsymmetric, large and sparse linear
systems. In this paper, the GMRES method with the block circulant
preconditioner is proposed for solving these linear systems. One of the main
results is that if an $A_{\nu_1,\nu_2}$-stable boundary value method is used
for an m-by-m system of ODEs, then the preconditioner is invertible and the
preconditioned matrix can be decomposed as I+L, where I is the identity matrix
and the rank of L is at most $2m(\nu_1+\nu_2)$. It means that when the GMRES
method is applied to solve the preconditioned linear systems, the method will
converge in at most $2m(\nu_1+\nu_2)+1$ iterations.Finally, extensive numerical
experiments are reported to illustrate the effectiveness of our methods for
solving the fractional diffusion equations.

{\beta}-model; and the model described in Olamaie et al. 2012 with the pressure
profile fixed according to Arnaud et al. 2010. The cluster mass derived from
these different models is comparable but our Bayesian evidences indicate a
preference for the {\beta}-profile which we, therefore, use throughout our
analysis. From the CARMA data alone we obtain a Bayesian probability of
detection ratio of 12.8:1 when assuming that a cluster exists within our search
area; alternatively assuming that Jenkins et al. 2001 accurately predicts the
number of clusters as a function of mass and redshift, the Bayesian probability
of detection is 0.29:1. From the analysis of the AMI or AMI & CARMA data the
probability of detection ratio exceeds 4.5x10^3:1. Performing a joint analysis
of the AMI & CARMA data with a physical cluster model we derive the total mass
internal to r200 as MT,200 = 4.1x10^14Msun. Using a phenomenological
{\beta}-model to quantify the temperature decrement as a function of angular
distance we find a central SZ temperature decrement of 170{\mu}K in the AMI &
CARMA data. The SZ decrement in the CARMA data is weaker than expected and we
speculate that this is a consequence of the cluster morphology. In a
forthcoming study we will assess the impact of cluster morphology on the SZ
decrements that are observed with interferometers such as AMI and CARMA.

strategy works in the sense that the dissipation of mass occurs most locally

strategy where the nodes are chosen randomly. Although the random control has
some ability to reduce the probability of large avalanches, its performance is
much worse than the one based on the choice of the highest degree nodes.

its ability to reduce the concentration of mass on the network.

The line is centered at a velocity of ~960kms-1, which is redshifted by about
400kms-1 from the systemic velocity. Such an offset, as well as the width of
~120kms-1, could be consistent with either a nuclear maser arising from an
accretion disk of the central supermassive black hole, or for a jet maser that
is emitted from the material that is shocked near the base of the jet in
Centaurus\,A. The best spatial resolution of our ATCA data constrains the
origin of the maser feature within <3pc from the supermassive black hole. The
maser exhibits a luminosity of ~1Lo, which classifies it as a kilomaser, and
appears to be variable on timescales of months. A kilomaser can also be emitted
by shocked gas in star forming regions. Given the small projected distance from
the core, the large offset from systemic velocity, as well as the smoothness of
the line feature, we conclude that a jet maser line emitted by shocked gas
around the base of the AGN is the most likely explanation. For this scenario we
can infer a minimum density of the radio jet of ~>10cm-3, which indicates
substantial mass entrainment of surrounding gas into the propagating jet

the second most massive body in the main belt. The high quality of the gathered
data provides us with an unique opportunity to determine the surface and
internal properties of one of the most important and intriguing main belt
asteroids (MBAs). In this paper, we focus on the size frequency distributions
(SFDs) of sub-kilometer impact craters observed at high spatial resolution on
several selected young terrains on Vesta. These small crater populations offer
an excellent opportunity to determine the nature of their asteroidal precursors
(namely MBAs) at sizes that are not directly observable from ground-based
telescopes (i.e., below ~100 m diameter). Moreover, unlike many other MBA
surfaces observed by spacecraft thus far, the young terrains examined had
crater spatial densities that were far from empirical saturation. Overall, we
find that the cumulative power-law index (slope) of small crater SFDs on Vesta
is fairly consistent with predictions derived from current collisional and
dynamical models down to a projectile size of ~10 m diameter (Bottke et al.,
2005a,b). The shape of the impactor SFD for small projectile sizes does not
appear to have changed over the last several billions of years, and an argument
can be made that the absolute number of small MBAs has remained roughly
constant (within a factor of 2) over the same time period. The apparent steady
state nature of the main belt population potentially provides us with a set of
intriguing constraints that can be used to glean insights into the physical
evolution of individual MBAs as well as the main belt as an ensemble.

renormalized transfer matrix method (RTMM) by setting up a set of linear
equations from U times of multiplication of traditional transfer matrix
(U=N/S}with N and S being the atom number of length and the transfer step), and
smaller S is required for wider systems. Then we solve the above linear
equations by Gauss elimination method and further optimize to reduce the
computational complexity from O(U^3M^3) to O(UM^3), in which M is the atom
number of the width. Applying RTMM, we study transport properties of large
scale pure and long-range correlated disordered armchair graphene nanoribbon
(AGR) (carbon atoms up to 10^6 for pure case) between quantum wire contacts. As
for pure AGR, the conductance is superlinear with the Fermi energy and the
conductance is linear with the width while independent of the length, showing
characteristics of ballistic transport. As for disordered AGR with long-range
correlation, there is metal-insulator transition induced by the correlation
strength of disorder. It is straightforward to extend RTMM to investigate
transport in large scale system with irregular structure.

potentially leads to the expansion of the just formed stellar cluster and

star formation efficiency and scales with the mass and size of the stellar
group as long as stellar interactions can be neglected. We investigate under
which circumstances stellar interactions between cluster members become so
important that the fraction of bound stars after gas expulsion is significantly
altered. The Nbody6 code is used to simulate the cluster dynamics after gas
expulsion for different SFEs. Concentrating on the most massive clusters
observed in the Milky Way, we test to what extend the results depend on the
model, i.e. stellar mass distribution, stellar density profile etc., and the
cluster parameters, such as cluster density and size.We find that stellar
interactions are responsible for up to 20% mass loss in the most compact
massive clusters in the Milky Way, making ejections the prime mass loss process
in such systems. Even in the loosely bound OB associations stellar interactions
are responsible for at least ~5% mass loss. The main reason why the importance
of encounters for massive clusters has been largely overlooked is the often
used approach of a single-mass representation instead of a realistic
distribution for the stellar masses. The density-dependence of the
encounter-induced mass loss is shallower than expected because of the
increasing importance of few-body interactions in dense clusters compared to
sparse clusters where 2-body encounters dominate.

collapse or shift regimes suddenly and without rapid external forcing poses a
serious challenge to our understanding and management of the natural world. The
potential to identify early warning signals that would allow researchers and
managers to predict such events before they happen has therefore been an
invaluable discovery that offers a way forward in spite of such seemingly
unpredictable behavior. Research into early warning signals has demonstrated
that it is possible to define and detect such early warning signals in advance
of a transition in certain contexts. Here we describe the pattern emerging as
research continues to explore just how far we can generalize these results. A
core of examples emerges that shares three properties: the phenomenon of rapid
regime shifts, a pattern of 'critical slowing down' that can be used to detect
the approaching shift, and a mechanism of bifurcation driving the sudden
change. As research has expanded beyond these core examples, it is becoming
clear that not all systems that show regime shifts exhibit critical slowing
down, or vice versa. Even when systems exhibit critical slowing down,
statistical detection is a challenge. We review the literature that explores
these edge cases and highlight the need for (a) new early warning behaviors
that can be used in cases where rapid shifts do not exhibit critical slowing
down, (b) the development of methods to identify which behavior might be an
appropriate signal when encountering a novel system; bearing in mind that a
positive indication for some systems is a negative indication in others, and
(c) statistical methods that can distinguish between signatures of early
warning behaviors and noise.

small tasks at a much lower price compared with traditional in-house solutions,
it suffers from quality problems due to the lack of incentives. On the other
hand, providing incentives for microtask crowdsourcing is challenging since
verifying the quality of submitted solutions is so expensive that will negate
the advantage of microtask crowdsourcing. We study cost-effective incentive
mechanisms for microtask crowdsourcing in this paper. In particular, we
consider a model with strategic workers, where the primary objective of a
worker is to maximize his own utility. Based on this model, we analyze two
basic mechanisms widely adopted in existing microtask crowdsourcing
applications and show that, to obtain high quality solutions from workers,
their costs are constrained by some lower bounds. We then propose a
cost-effective mechanism that employs quality-aware worker training as a tool
to stimulate workers to provide high quality solutions. We prove theoretically
that the proposed mechanism, when properly designed, can obtain high quality
solutions with an arbitrarily low cost. Beyond its theoretical guarantees, we
further demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed mechanisms through a set
of behavioral experiments.

geosynchronous magnetopause crossings (GMCs) and about 6000 minutes when
geosynchronous satellites of GOES and LANL series are located in the
magnetosheath (so-called MSh intervals) in 1994 to 2001. Minimizing of the Psw
required for GMCs and MSh intervals at various locations, Bz and SYM-H allows
describing both an effect of magnetopause dawn-dusk asymmetry and saturation of
Bz influence for very large southward IMF. The asymmetry is strong for large
negative Bz and almost disappears when Bz is positive. We found that the larger
amplitude of negative SYM-H the lower solar wind pressure is required for GMCs.
We attribute this effect to a depletion of the dayside magnetic field by a
storm-time intensification of the cross-tail current. It is also found that the
magnitude of threshold for Bz saturation increases with SYM-H index such that
for small negative and positive SYM-H the effect of saturation diminishes. This
supports an idea that enhanced thermal pressure of the magnetospheric plasma
and ring current particles during magnetic storms results in the saturation of
magnetic effect of the IMF Bz at the dayside magnetopause. A noticeable
advantage of the model prediction capabilities in comparison with other
magnetopause models makes the model useful for space weather predictions.

duskward shifting of the cutoff boundaries in relation to intensification of
the cross-tail current, field-aligned currents, and symmetrical and

a polar cap absorption (PCA) effects observed at high latitudes by CADI network

the ionization of ionospheric D-layer at altitudes of ~75 to 85 km. This

investigated for a cylindrical two-dimensional electron gas confined in a

interaction. We present analytical solutions for the two limiting cases, in
which the spin-orbit interaction results from (A) the radial electric field and
(B) the electric field applied along the axis z of the nanotube. In case (A),
the superposition of the two lowest-energy bands corresponding to the opposite
spins leads to the precession of electron spin around the nanowire axis. We
have found that the direction of the spin precession changes from clockwise to
counterclockwise if the energy of the injected electron achieves the value
corresponding to the crossing of energy levels associated with the two
components of the superposition state. In case (B), we have obtained the damped
oscillations of the z spin component with the period that changes as a function
of the coordinate z. We have also shown that the damped oscillations of the
average value of the z spin component form beats localized along the nanowire

define a geometrical notion of temperature for quantum isolated horizons. This
is done by demanding that the horizon state satisfying the boundary conditions
be a Kubo-Martin-Schwinger state. The exact formula for the temperature can be
derived by imposing the reality conditions in the form of the linear simplicity
constraints for an imaginary Barbero-Immirzi parameter. Thus, our analysis
reveals the connection between the analytic continuation to the Ashtekar
self-dual variables and the thermality of the horizon. The horizon thermal
equilibrium state can then be used to compute both the entanglement and the
Boltzmann entropies. We show that the two provide the same finite answer, which
allows us to recover the Bekenstein-Hawking formula in the semi-classical
limit. In this way, we shed new light on the microscopic origin of black hole
entropy by revealing the equivalence between the near-horizon degrees of
freedom entanglement proposal and the state-counting interpretation. The
connection with the Connes-Rovelli thermal time proposal for a general

a set system of larger size. Except for the case k=2, solved by Ahlswede and

  Our ultimate goal is a detection and analysis of an extended sample of Gamma
Dor-type pulsating stars with the aim to search for observational evidence of
non-uniform period spacings and rotational splittings of gravity modes in
main-sequence stars typically twice as massive as the Sun.
  We applied an automated supervised photometric classification method to
select a sample of 69 Gamma Doradus candidate stars. We used an advanced method
to extract the Kepler light curves from the pixel data information using custom
masks. For 36 of the stars, we obtained high-resolution spectroscopy with the
HERMES spectrograph installed at the Mercator telescope.
  We find that all stars for which spectroscopic estimates of Teff and logg are
available fall into the region of the HR diagram where the Gamma Dor and Delta
Sct instability strips overlap. The stars cluster in a 700 K window in
effective temperature, logg measurements suggest luminosity class IV-V. From
the Kepler photometry, we identify 45 Gamma Dor-type pulsators, 14 Gamma
Dor/Delta Sct hybrids, and 10 stars which are classified as ""possibly Gamma
Dor/Delta Sct hybrid pulsators"".
  The results of photometric and spectroscopic classifications according to the
type of variability are in perfect agreement. We find a clear correlation
between the spectroscopically derived vsini and the frequencies of independent
pulsation modes and show that it has nothing to do with rotational modulation
of the stars but is related to their stellar pulsations. Our sample and
frequency determinations offer a good starting point for seismic modelling of
slow to moderately rotating Gamma Dor stars.

and quiet phases that alternate quasi-periodically; the variation of the
slowing-down rate of its period between active and quiet phases; and because
there are no timing residuals, it is highly unlikely that the pulsar has a
massive companion. Here, we examine the effects that one putative companion
immersed in the magnetospheric plasma or the wind of the pulsar might have, as
well as the associated electric current distribution. We analysed several
possibilities for the distance and orbit of this hypothetical companion and the
nature of its interaction with the neutron star. We show that if the
quasi-periodic behaviour of PSR B1931+24 was caused by a companion orbiting the
star with a period of 35 or 70 days, the radio emissions, usually considered to

their magnetospheric activity is interrupted or reduced. We constrained our
analysis on eight fundamental properties of PSR B1931+24 that summarise the
observations. We considered that the disruption/activation of the
magnetospheric activity would be caused by the direct interaction of the star
with the Alfv\'en wings emanating from the companions. We also considered the
recurrence period of 70 days to be the period of precession of the periastron
of the companions orbit. We analysed in which way the time scale of the
""on/off"" pseudo-cycle would be conditioned by the precession of the periastron
and not by the orbital time scale, and we derived a set of orbital constraints
that we solved. We then compared the model, based on PSR 1931+24, with the
known properties of PSR 1841+0500. We conclude that PSR B1931+24 may be
surrounded at a close distance to the star by a stream of small bodies of
kilometric or sub-kilometric sizes that could originate from the tidal
disruption of a body of moderate size that fell at a close distance to the
neutron star on an initially very eccentric orbit. This scenario is also
compatible with the properties of PSR J1841-0500, although the properties of
PSR J1841-0500 are, by now, less constrained. These results raise new

the reciprocal transformation to the Novikov equation. We also show by
specifying a complex phase parameter that the smooth soliton is converted to a
novel singular soliton with single cusp and double peaks. We demonstrate that
both the smooth and singular solitons converge to a peakon as the background
field tends to zero whereby we employ a method that has been developed for
performing the similar limiting procedure for the multisoliton solutions of the

disordered graphene systems with two kinds of disorder, Anderson type
impurities and random dopants. To avoid the brute-force calculation which is
time consuming and impractical at low doping concentration, we develop an
expansion method based on the coherent potential approximation (CPA) to
calculate the average of four Green's functions and the results are obtained by
truncating the expansion up to 6th order in terms of ""single-site-T-matrix"".
Since our expansion is with respect to ""single-site-T-matrix"" instead of
disorder strength $W$, good result can be obtained at 6th order for finite $W$.
We benchmark our results against brute-force method on disordered graphene
systems as well as the two dimensional square lattice model systems for both
Anderson disorder and the random doping. The results show that in the regime
where the disorder strength $W$ is small or the doping concentration is low,
our results agree well with the results obtained from the brute-force method.
Specifically, for the graphene system with Anderson impurities, our results for
conductance fluctuation show good agreement for $W$ up to $0.4t$, where $t$ is
the hopping energy. While for average shot noise, the results are good for $W$
up to $0.2t$. When the graphene system is doped with low concentration 1%, the
conductance fluctuation and shot noise agrees with brute-force results for
large $W$ which is comparable to the hopping energy $t$. At large doping
concentration 10%, good agreement can be reached for conductance fluctuation
and shot noise for $W$ up to $0.4t$. We have also tested our formalism on

magnetostriction, and thermal-expansion measurements were performed to
characterize the magnetic phase diagram. In particular, for magnetic fields
along the b axis five different magnetic regions have been detected, some of
them exhibiting short-range-order effects. The experimental magnetic entropy
and magnetization are compared to a theoretical modelling of these quantities
using DMRG and TMRG approaches. Within the framework of a purely 1D isotropic
model Hamiltonian, only a qualitative agreement between theory and the
experimental data can be achieved. Instead, it is demonstrated that a
significant symmetric anisotropic exchange of about 10% is necessary to account
for the basic experimental observations, including the 3D saturation field, and
which in turn might stabilize a triatic (three-magnon) multipolar phase.

interesting candidates for spintronics applications. In the present paper we
propose two models for description of the current-induced phenomena in
antiferromagnetic textures. We show that the magnetization that originates from
rotation or oscillations of antiferromagnetic vector can, via $sd$-exchange
coupling, polarize the current and give rise to adiabatic and nonadiabatic spin
torques. Due to the Lorentz-type dynamics of antiferromagnetic moments (unlike
the Galilenian-like dynamics in ferromagnets), the adiabatic spin torque
affects the characteristic lengthscale of the moving texture. Nonadiabatic spin
torque contributes to the energy pumping and can induce the stable motion of
antiferromagnetic texture, but, in contrast to ferromagnets, has pure dynamic
origin. We also consider the current-induced phenomena in artificial
antiferromagnets where the current maps the staggered magnetization of the
structure. In this case the effect of nonadiabatic spin torque is similar to
that in ferromagnetic constituents of the structure. In particular, the current
can remove degeneracy of the translational antiferromagnetic domains
indistinguishable in the external magnetic field and thus can set into motion
the 180$^\circ$ domain wall.

that these fluids are sometimes also called Korteweg-de Vries or Cahn-Allen. In
general continua whose deformation energy depend on the second gradient of
placement are called second gradient (or Piola-Toupin or Mindlin or
Green-Rivlin or Germain or second gradient) continua. In the present paper, a
material description for second gradient continua is formulated. A Lagrangian
action is introduced in both material and spatial description and the
corresponding Euler-Lagrange bulk and boundary conditions are found. These
conditions are formulated in terms of an objective deformation energy volume
density in two cases: when this energy is assumed to depend on either C and
grad C or on C^-1 and grad C^-1 ; where C is the Cauchy-Green deformation
tensor. When particularized to energies which characterize fluid materials, the
capillary fluid evolution conditions (see e.g. Casal or Seppecher for an
alternative deduction based on thermodynamic arguments) are recovered. A

mechanically stable range of fluorite structure of UO2, which dictates the
maximum possible pressure of relevant pseudo-phase transitions, gives rise to
defect formation energies that span a wide band and overlap with the existing
experimental estimates. We reveal that the knowledge about pseudo-phase
boundaries can not only provide important information of energetics that is
helpful for reducing the scattering in current estimates, but also be valuable
for guiding theoretical assessments, even to validate or disprove a theory. In
order to take defect interactions into account and to extrapolate the physical
quantities at finite stoichiometry deviations to that near the stoichiometry,
we develop a general formalism to describe the thermodynamics of a defective
system. We also show that it is possible to include interactions among defects
in a simple expression of point defect model (PDM) by introducing an auxiliary
constant mean-field. This generalization of the simple PDM leads to great
versatility that allows one to study nonlinear effects of stoichiometry
deviation on materials' behavior. It is a powerful tool to extract the defect
energetics from finite defect concentrations to the dilute limit. Besides
these, the full content of the theoretical formalism and some relevant and
interesting issues, including reentrant pseudo-transition, multi-defect
coexistence, charged defects, and possible consequence of instantaneous

first is the direct Device-to-Device (D2D) communications, which enables direct

the objective is to attach a large number of low-rate low-power devices, termed
Machine-Type Devices (MTDs) to the cellular network. MTDs pose new challenges
to the cellular network, one if which is that the low transmission power can
lead to outage problems for the cell-edge devices. Another issue imminent to
MTC is the \emph{massive access} that can lead to overload of the radio
interface. In this paper we explore the opportunity opened by D2D links for
supporting MTDs, since it can be desirable to carry the MTC traffic not through
direct links to a Base Station, but through a nearby relay. MTC is modeled as a
fixed-rate traffic with an outage requirement. We propose two network-assisted
D2D schemes that enable the cooperation between MTDs and standard cellular
devices, thereby meeting the MTC outage requirements while maximizing the rate
of the broadband services for the other devices. The proposed schemes apply the
principles Opportunistic Interference Cancellation and the Cognitive Radio's

simulates the entire discharge, a planar radio frequency capacitively coupled

the recently published scheme Ensemble-in-Spacetime (EST); it resolves only the

sheath charge-voltage relation; also other ion transit time effects are found.
The two codes are in good agreement, both with respect to the spatial and
temporal dynamics of the sheath and with respect to the ion energy
distributions at the electrodes. It is concluded that the EST scheme may serve
as an efficient post-processor for fluid or global simulations and for

extra dimensions are subsequently removed by closed string tachyon
condensation, which breaks the continuous symmetry but preserves a discrete

ranging from 0.4g to 1.2g. With the aid of discrete element modeling
simulations, we reproduce these results and extend this range to include
objects as small as asteroids and as large as Jupiter. Surprisingly, we find
that the final sink depth is independent of the gravitational acceleration, an
observation with immediate relevance to the design of future extraterrestrial
structures land-roving spacecraft. Using a phenomenological equation of motion
that includes a gravity-loaded frictional term, we are able to quantitatively
explain the experimental and simulation results.

is developed. This memory means the dependence between arbitrary number of
successive jumps of the process, while waiting times between jumps are
considered as i.i.d. random variables. The dependence was found by analysis of
empirical histograms for the stochastic process of a single share price on a
market within the high frequency time scale, and justified theoretically by
considering bid-ask bounce mechanism containing some delay characteristic for
any double-auction market. Our model turns out to be exactly analytically
solvable, which enables a direct comparison of its predictions with their
empirical counterparts, for instance, with empirical velocity autocorrelation
function. Thus this paper significantly extends the capabilities of the CTRW

`redback' with a near Roche-lobe filling $\sim$0.2 solar mass non-degenerate

covered a full binary orbit for each pulsar. Two pulsars, PSRs J2215+5135 and
J2256$-$1024, show significant orbital variability while PSR J1124$-$3653 shows
marginal orbital variability. The lightcurves for these three pulsars have
X-ray flux minima coinciding with the phases of the radio eclipses. This
phenomenon is consistent with an intrabinary shock emission interpretation for
the X-rays. The other two pulsars, PSRs J0023+0923 and J1810+1744, are fainter

model, and a combined model with both power-law and blackbody components. The
preferred spectral fits yield power-law indices that range from 1.3 to 3.2 and
blackbody temperatures in the hundreds of eV. The spectrum for PSR J2215+5135
shows a significant hard X-ray component, with a large number of counts above 2
keV, which is additional evidence for the presence of intrabinary shock
emission and is similar to what has been detected in the low-mass X-ray binary

the fronts connecting two stable states. In particular we show that non local

creation of localized structures, emerging from pinning between two fronts. In
parameter space the region where fronts are oscillatory is limited by three
transitions: the modulational instability of the homogeneous state, the
Belyakov-Devaney transition in which monotonic fronts acquire spatial
oscillations with infinite wavelength, and a crossover in which monotonically
decaying fronts develop oscillations with a finite wavelength. We show how
these transitions are organized by codimension 2 and 3 point s and illustrate
how by changing the parameters of the nonlocal coupling it is possible to bring
the system into the region where localized structures can be formed.

In a
rumor process a signal starts from the stations of a fixed vertex (the root)
and travels on a graph from vertex to vertex. We consider two rumor processes.
In the firework process each station, when reached by the signal, transmits it
up to a random distance. In the reverse firework process, on the other hand,
stations do not send any signal but they ""listen"" for it up to a random
distance. The first random environment that we consider is the deterministic
1-dimensional tree N with a random number of stations on each vertex; in this
case the root is the origin of N. We give conditions for the
survival/extinction on almost every realization of the sequence of stations.
Later on, we study the processes on Galton-Watson trees with random number of
stations on each vertex. We show that if the probability of survival is
positive, then there is survival on almost every realization of the infinite
tree such that there is at least one station at the root. We characterize the
survival of the process in some cases and we give sufficient conditions for

information processing. They give access to large Hilbert spaces and, in turn,
enable the encoding of quantum information on multiple modes. One method to
create such quantum states is parametric down-conversion (PDC) in waveguide
arrays (WGAs) which allows for the creation of highly entangled photon-pairs in
controlled, easily accessible spatial modes, with unique spectral properties.
In this paper we examine both theoretically and experimentally the PDC process
in a lithium niobate WGA. We measure the spatial and spectral properties of the
emitted photon-pairs, revealing strong correlations between spectral and
spatial degrees of freedom of the created photons. Our measurements show that,
in contrast to prior theoretical approaches, spectrally dependent coupling
effects have to be taken into account in the theory of PDC in WGAs. To
interpret the results, we developed a theoretical model specifically taking
into account spectrally dependent coupling effects, which further enables us to
explore the capabilities and limitations for engineering the spatial
correlations of the generated quantum states.

near-field enhancement around the surface of metallic nanoparticles of
arbitrary shape. The method is based on the boundary integral equation in the
electrostatic limit. Besides the nanoparticle polarizability and the far-field
response, the near-field enhancement around nanoparticles can be also
conveniently expressed as an eigenmode sum of resonant terms. Moreover, the
spatial configuration of the near-field enhancement depends explicitly on the
eigenfunctions of both the BIE integral operator and of its adjoint. It is also
established a direct physical meaning of the two types of eigenfunctions. While
it is well known that the eigenfunctions of the BIE operator are electric
charge modes, it is less known and used that the eigenfunctions of the adjoint
represent the electric potential generated by the charge modes. For the
enhanced spectroscopies the present method allows an easy identification of hot
spots which are located in the regions with maximum charge densities and/or
regions with fast variations of the electric potential generated by the charge
modes on the surface. This study also clarifies the similarities and the
differences between the far-field and the near-field behavior of plasmonic
systems. Finally, the analysis of concrete examples like the nearly touching
dimer, the prolate spheroid, and the nanorod illustrate some modalities to
improve the near-field enhancement.

transferable to the condensed phase when the inter-molecular interactions are

form well separated resonances. When stepping from $^{144}$Sm to $^{154}$Sm, we
observe an increase of the toroidal, compression and vortical contributions in
the low-energy region (often called pygmy resonance). The strength in this

core bounce and subsequent neutrino heating and is a unique example
successfully produced by first-principle simulations. This allows us to derive
a first self-consistent multicolor light curves of a CCSN. Adopting the

$2.5\times10^{-3}M_\odot$, we perform a multigroup radiation hydrodynamics

with various envelope mass and hydrogen abundance. We demonstrate that a shock
breakout has peak luminosity of $L\sim2\times10^{44}$ erg/s and can evaporate
circumstellar dust up to $R\sim10^{17}$ cm for a case of carbon dust, that
plateau luminosity and plateau duration of ECSNe are $L\sim10^{42}$ erg/s and
$t\sim60-100$ days, respectively, and that a plateau is followed by a tail with
a luminosity drop by $\sim4$ mag. The ECSN shows a bright and short plateau
that is as bright as typical Type II plateau supernovae, and a faint tail that
might be influenced by spin-down luminosity of a newborn pulsar. Furthermore,
the theoretical models are compared with ECSN candidates: SN 1054 and SN 2008S.
We find that SN 1054 shares the characteristics of the ECSNe. For SN 2008S, we
find that its faint plateau requires an ECSN model with a significantly low
explosion energy of $E\sim10^{48}$ erg.

back laser pulses to the emitting ground station. This allows accurate
positioning of the satellite, which is important for measuring the very small
deviations from Galilei-Newton's laws. In 2008, ASI selected the prime

We interpret this as photo-electrically generated charges on insulating

the exposure of the ion trap to a beam of Ba atoms mainly exhibit slow dynamics
on the order of months. We explain this observation as a consequence of a
coating of the trap electrodes by the atomic beam. This may lead to contact
potentials which can slowly drift over time due to atomic diffusion and
chemical processes on the surface. In order not to perturb the field
evolutions, we suppress the generation of additional charges and atomic
coatings in the Paul trap during the measurements. For this, we shield the ion
trap from ambient light and only allow the use of near-infrared lasers.
Furthermore, we minimize the flux of atoms into the ion trap chamber. Long-term
operation of our shielded trap led us to a regime of very low residual electric

other GRBs with spectroscopically confirmed SNe. In our dense photometric
monitoring, we detect excess flux in the host-subtracted r-band light curve,
consistent with what expected from an emerging SN, ~0.2 mag fainter than the
prototypical SN 1998bw. A spectrum obtained around the time of the SN peak
(16.7 days after the GRB) reveals broad undulations typical of SNe Ic-BL,
confirming the presence of a SN, designated SN 2013cq. The spectral shape and
early peak time are similar to those of the high expansion velocity SN 2010bh
associated with GRB 100316D. Our findings demonstrate that high-energy
long-duration GRBs, commonly detected at high redshift, can also be associated
with SNe Ic-BL, pointing to a common progenitor mechanism.

beyond the standard model which contains the $\tau$-lepton anomalous magnetic
moment, electric dipole moment and weak dipole moments in two operators of
dimension six. We include in our study two additional operators of dimension
eight that directly couple the $\tau$-leptons to gluons and are therefore
enhanced at the LHC. We consider the two main effects from these couplings:
modifications to the Drell-Yan cross-section and to the $\tau$-lepton pair
production in association with a Higgs boson. We find that a measurement of the
former at the 14% level can produce constraints comparable to existing ones for
the anomalous dipole couplings; and that a bound on the latter at a sensitivity
level of $500\ \sigma_{SM}$ or better would produce the best constraint on the
$\tau$-gluonic couplings.

meson system gives us access to a mass eigenstate rate asymmetry for each B_s
transition. This observable is not only the key ingredient in converting
between differing definitions of a B_s branching ratio, but can also be a
sensitive probe of New Physics that does not require flavour tagging. We
discuss how a pair of effective lifetimes for CP even and odd final states,
which probe this asymmetry, can constrain the parameters of B_s mixing. We then
shift our focus to the rare decay B_s to mu+ mu-, for which the Standard Model
branching ratio prediction receives a sizable correction due to a maximal
asymmetry. We present how this asymmetry, which can be extracted from an
untagged time-dependent measurement, serves as a new observable, complementary
to the branching ratio, for constraining New Physics. Further, we analyse types
of models beyond the Standard Model that this pair of observables for B_s to
mu+ mu- can discriminate between.

further and further away. In time, the universe asymptotes towards an
equilibrium state of the gravitational field. Flat Minkowski space is the limit
of this process. It is indistinguishable from a space with an extremely small
cosmological constant (\Lambda -> 0) and thus has divergent entropy.

tremendous mass, was proposed to explain why galaxies hold together and rotate
faster at their edges than predicted by Newton's Inverse Square (1/r2) Law of
Gravity. Here we propose an alternative, an Inverse Law (1/r), which explains
galactic morphology and rotation without dark matter. By varying initial
conditions, the Inverse Law can systematically and easily generate realistic
galactic formations including spirals, cartwheels (extremely difficult under
Newtonian gravity), bars, rings, and spokes. This model can also produce
filaments and void structures reminiscent of the large-scale structure of the
universe. Newtonian gravity cannot do all this without dark matter. Occam's
Razor suggests that at galactic scales, gravity should be 1/r and dark matter
is unnecessary. This simple model with its self-organizing emergent properties,
combined with dynamical systems theory, has broader implications. It may help
us understand more complex systems.

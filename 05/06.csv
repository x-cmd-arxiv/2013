reached with non-zero probabilities. These outcomes resemble those found in the
quench of the 2d Ising model; however, the variety of static states in the
q-state Potts model (with q>=3) is much richer than in the Ising model, where
static states are either ground or stripe states. Another possibility is that
the system gets trapped on a set of equal-energy blinker states where a subset
of spins can flip ad infinitum; these states are similar to those found in the
quench of the 3d Ising model. The evolution towards the final energy is also
unusual---at long times, sudden and massive energy drops may occur that are
accompanied by macroscopic reordering of the domain structure. This
indeterminacy in the zero-temperature quench of the kinetic Potts model is at
odds with basic predictions from the theory of phase-ordering kinetics. We also
propose a continuum description of coarsening with more than two equivalent
ground states. The resulting time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations reproduce

embedding the modified standard model into a SO(10) chiral gauge theory and
then putting the SO(10) chiral gauge theory on a 3D spatial lattice with a

Hamiltonian quantum theory with a finite-dimensional Hilbert space for a finite

symmetry-protected topological orders, we show that any chiral gauge theory can

inclusion of realistic transverse expansion for the medium strongly suppresses
elliptic flow at high p_T compared to calculations with longitudinal Bjorken

Transverse expansion also enhances the high-p_T suppression, while fluctuations
in energy loss with the rescattering location of the jet parton in the medium

  Festschrift: Celebrating 45 Years of Astrochemistry (in press)",,"10.1021/jp311240h",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present 74 MHz radio continuum observations of the Galactic center region.
These measurements show nonthermal radio emission arising from molecular clouds
that is unaffected by free-free absorption along the line of sight. We focus on
one cloud, G0.13--0.13, representative of the population of molecular clouds
that are spatially correlated with steep spectrum
(alpha^{74MHz}_{327MHz}=1.3\pm0.3) nonthermal emission from the Galactic center
region. This cloud lies adjacent to the nonthermal radio filaments of the Arc
near l~0.2^0 and is a strong source of 74 MHz continuum, SiO (2-1) and FeI
Kalpha 6.4 keV line emission. This three-way correlation provides the most
compelling evidence yet that relativistic electrons, here traced by 74 MHz
emission, are physically associated with the G0.13--0.13 molecular cloud and
that low energy cosmic ray electrons are responsible for the FeI Kalpha line
emission. The high cosmic ray ionization rate ~10-13 s-1 H-1 is responsible for
heating the molecular gas to high temperatures and allows the disturbed gas to
maintain a high velocity dispersion. LVG modeling of multi-transition SiO
observations of this cloud implies H2 densities ~104-5 cm-3 and high
temperatures. The lower limit to the temperature of G0.13-0.13 is ~100K,
whereas the upper limit is as high as 1000K. Lastly, we used a time-dependent
chemical model in which cosmic rays drive the chemistry of the gas to
investigate for molecular line diagnostics of cosmic ray heating. When the
cloud reaches chemical equilibrium, the abundance ratios of HCN/HNC and
N2H+/HCO+ are consistent with measured values. In addition, significant
abundance of SiO is predicted in the cosmic ray dominated region of the
Galactic center. We discuss different possibilities to account for the origin
of widespread SiO emission detected from Galactic center molecular clouds.

force-extension curve and the differential stiffness exactly and discuss
several limiting cases. Cross-links effectively stiffen the chain pair by
reducing thermal fluctuations transverse to the force and alignment direction.
The extra alignment due to cross-links increases both with growing number and
with growing strength of the cross-links, and is most prominent for small force
f. For large f, the additional, cross-link-induced extension is subdominant
except for the case of linking the chains rigidly and continuously along their
contour. In this combined limit, we recover asymptotically the elasticity of a
weakly bending wormlike chain without constraints, stiffened by a factor four.
The increase in differential stiffness can be as large as 100% for small f or
large numbers of cross-links.

  Covariance Estimation for Maximum Likelihood Estimates","PhD dissertation",,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Maximum likelihood estimation is a popular method in statistical inference.
As a way of assessing the accuracy of the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE),
the calculation of the covariance matrix of the MLE is of great interest in
practice. Standard statistical theory shows that the normalized MLE is
asymptotically normally distributed with covariance matrix being the inverse of
the Fisher information matrix (FIM) at the unknown parameter. Two commonly used
estimates for the covariance of the MLE are the inverse of the observed FIM
(the same as the inverse Hessian of the negative log-likelihood) and the
inverse of the expected FIM (the same as the inverse FIM). Both of the observed
and expected FIM are evaluated at the MLE from the sample data. In this
dissertation, we demonstrate that, under reasonable conditions similar to
standard MLE conditions, the inverse expected FIM outperforms the inverse
observed FIM under a mean squared error criterion. Specifically, in an
asymptotic sense, the inverse expected FIM (evaluated at the MLE) has no
greater mean squared error with respect to the true covariance matrix than the
inverse observed FIM (evaluated at the MLE) at the element level. This result
is different from widely accepted results showing preference for the observed
FIM. In this dissertation, we present theoretical derivations that lead to the
conclusion above. We also present numerical studies on three distinct problems
to support the theoretical result. This dissertation also includes two
appendices on topics of relevance to stochastic systems. The first appendix
discusses optimal perturbation distributions for the simultaneous perturbation
stochastic approximation (SPSA) algorithm. The second appendix considers Monte
Carlo methods for computing FIMs when closed forms are not attainable.

correlators of surface operators $\mathcal{W}\left( \Sigma\right)$ defined
along a surface $\Sigma$ within the boundary gauge theory. This construction
relies on the strong analogies between the twist field operators appearing in
the replica trick method used for the computation of the entanglement entropy,
and the disorder-like surface operators in gauge theories. In the AdS/CFT
correspondence, a surface operator $\mathcal{W}\left( \Sigma\right)$
corresponds to having a D3-brane in $AdS_5 \times S^5$ ending on the boundary
along the prescribed surface $\Sigma$. Then, a long distance expansion for
$\mathcal{I}_{AB}$ is provided. The coefficients of the expansion appear as a
byproduct of the operator product expansion for the correlators of the
operators $\mathcal{W}(\Sigma)$ with the chiral primaries of the theory. We
find that, while undergoing a phase transition at a critical distance, the
holographic mutual information, instead of strictly vanishing, decays with a
power law whose leading contributions of order $\mathcal{O}(N^0)$, originate
from the exchange of pairs of the lightest bulk particles between $A$ and $B$.

at a quantum critical point (QCP), sub-leading scaling can contain universal
behaviour. Such universal quantities are commonly studied in non-interacting
field theories, however it typically requires numerical calculation to access
them in interacting theories. In this paper, we use large-scale T=0 quantum
Monte Carlo simulations to examine in detail the second R\'enyi entropy of
entangled regions at the QCP in the transverse-field Ising model in 2+1
space-time dimensions -- a fixed point for which there is no exact result for
the scaling of entanglement entropy. We calculate a universal coefficient of a
vertex-induced logarithmic scaling for a polygonal entangled subregion, and
compare the result to interacting and non-interacting theories. We also examine
the shape-dependence of the R\'enyi entropy for finite-size toroidal lattices
divided into two entangled cylinders by smooth boundaries. Remarkably, we find
that the dependence on cylinder length follows a shape-dependent function

function approach. Our approach exploits recent advances in using an
established graph partitioning approach. The developed method has the
capability to handle open boundary conditions that are represented by full self
energy matrices required for realistic modeling of nanoscale devices. Our
method to calculate the electron density has a reduced complexity compared to
the established recursive Greens function approach. As an example, we apply our
algorithm to a quantum well superlattice and a carbon nanotube, which are
represented by a continuum and tight binding Hamiltonian respectively, and
demonstrate significant speed up over the recursive method.

isogeometric analysis heterogeneous multiscale method (IGA-HMM) investigated in
this paper is regarded as an alternative approach to the standard Finite
Element Heterogeneous Multiscale Method (FE-HMM) which is currently an
effective framework to solve these problems. The method utilizes non-uniform
rational B-splines (NURBS) in both macro and micro levels instead of standard
Lagrange basis. Beside the ability to describe exactly the geometry, it
tremendously facilitates high-order macroscopic/microscopic discretizations
thanks to the flexibility of refinement and degree elevation with an arbitrary
continuity level provided by NURBS basis functions. A priori error estimates of
the discretization error coming from macro and micro meshes and optimal micro
refinement strategies for macro/micro NURBS basis functions of arbitrary orders
are derived. Numerical results show the excellent performance of the proposed

that the flow through the NS is highly variable and controlled by mesoscale and

western part of the NR is negatively correlated with the flux through its

the northward water transport through the strait. Positive wind stress curl
over the strait area in winter--spring generates the cyclonic circulation and
thereby enhances the southward flow in the western part ($r=-0.68$) and
northward flow in the eastern part ($r=0.61$) of the NR. In fall, the water
transport in different parts of the NS is determined by the strength of the

virial estimators of black hole mass in quasars. Which is more reliable?
Comparison of MgII 2800 and Hbeta profile measures in the same sources and
especially FWHM measures that provide the virial broadening estimator.
Identification of 680 bright Sloan Digital Sky Survey DataRelease 7 quasars
with spectra showing both MgII 2800 and Hbeta lines, at redshift 0.4 < z <
0.75. The s/n of these spectra are high enough to allow binning in the
""four-dimensional (4D) eigenvector 1'' optical plane and construction of high
s/n composite spectra. We confirm that MgII 2800 shows a profile that is ~ 20%
narrower as suggested in some previous studies. FWHM measures for Population B
sources (i.e., with FWHM of Hbeta larger than 4000 km/s) are uncertain because
they show complex profiles with at least two broad-line components involving a
nearly unshifted broad and redshifted very-broad component. Only the broad
component is likely to be a valid virial estimator. If Hbeta and MgII 2800 are
not corrected for the very broad component then black hole mass values for
Population B sources will be systematically overestimated by up to logM ~
0.3-0.4 dex. We suggest a simple correction that can be applied to the majority
of sources. MgII 2800 is the safer virial estimator for Population B sources
because the centroid shifts with respect to rest frame are lower than for
Hbeta. In the broad and very broad component profile interpretation this is a
consequence of the lower very broad to broad component intensity ratio for MgII
2800. Effective discrimination of black hole mass and Eddington ratio at fixed
redshift is not achieved via luminosity binning but rather by binning in a ""4D
eigenvector 1'' context that reflects different broad line region
geometry/kinematics likely driven by Eddington ratio.

bosons and light fermions loaded in an optical lattice. We focus on the effect
of the light fermions on the dynamics of the heavy bosons. It is shown that,
when the lattice potential is sufficiently deep to confine the bosons to one
dimension but allowing the fermions to freely move in three dimensions (i.e. a
mixed-dimensionality lattice), the fermions act as an ohmic bath for bosons
leading to screening and dissipation effects on the bosons. Using a
perturbative renormalization-group analysis, it is shown that the
fermion-induced dissipative effects have no appreciable impact on the
transition from the superfluid to the Mott-insulator state at integer filling.
On the other hand, dissipative effects are found to be very important in the
half-filled case near the critical point. In this case, in the presence of a
finite incommensurability that destabilizes the Mott phase, the bosons can
still be localized by virtue of dissipative effects.

nearby galaxies has been obtained using UH88/SNIFS and Gemini-N/GMOS. The use
of integral field spectroscopy enables us to obtain both spatial and spectral
information of the explosion site, allowing the identification of the parent
stellar population of the supernova progenitor star. The spectrum of the parent
population provides metallicity determination via strong-line method and age
estimation obtained via comparison with simple stellar population (SSP) models.
We adopt this information as the metallicity and age of the supernova
progenitor, under the assumption that it was coeval with the parent stellar
population. The age of the star corresponds to its lifetime, which in turn
gives the estimate of its initial mass. With this method we were able to
determine both the metallicity and initial (ZAMS) mass of the progenitor stars
of the type Ib and Ic supernovae. We found that on average SN Ic explosion
sites are more metal-rich and younger than SN Ib sites. The initial mass of the
progenitors derived from parent stellar population age suggests that SN Ic have
more massive progenitors than SN Ib. In addition, we also found indication that
some of our SN progenitors are less massive than ~25 Msun, indicating that they
may have been stars in a close binary system that have lost their outer
envelope via binary interactions to produce Ib/c supernovae, instead of single
Wolf-Rayet stars. These findings support the current suggestions that both
binary and single progenitor channels are in effect in producing type Ib/c
supernovae. This work also demonstrates the power of integral field
spectroscopy in investigating supernova environments and active star forming
regions.

to separate, for the first time at far-IR wavelengths, the emission toward the

strong [OIII], [OI], [CII], [NIII], [NII], and [CI] fine structure lines (in
decreasing order of luminosity) arising in gas irradiated by UV-photons from
the central stellar cluster. In addition, rotationally excited lines of 12CO
(from J=4-3 to 24-23), 13CO, H2O, OH, H3O+, HCO+ and HCN, as well as
ground-state absorption lines of OH+, H2O+, H3O+, CH+, H2O, OH, HF, CH and NH
are detected. The excitation of the 12CO ladder is consistent with a hot
isothermal component at Tk ~ 10^{3.1} K and n(H2)< 10^4 cm^{-3}. It is also
consistent with a distribution of temperature components at higher density with
most CO at Tk<300 K. The detected molecular features suggest that, at present,
neither very enhanced X-ray, nor cosmic-ray fluxes play a dominant role in the
heating of the hot molecular gas. The hot CO component (either the bulk of the
CO column or just a small fraction depending on the above scenario) results
from a combination of UV- and shock-driven heating. If irradiated dense
clumps/clouds do not exist, shocks likely dominate the heating of the hot
molecular gas. This is consistent with the high-velocity gas detected toward
SgrA*.

highly dynamic networks that experience heavy node churn (i.e., nodes join and
leave the network continuously over time). Our goal is to guarantee, despite
high node churn rate, that a large number of nodes in the network can store,
retrieve, and maintain a large number of data items. Our main contributions are
fast randomized distributed algorithms that guarantee the above with high
probability (whp) even under high adversarial churn:
  1. A randomized distributed search algorithm that (whp) guarantees that
searches from as many as $n - o(n)$ nodes ($n$ is the stable network size)
succeed in ${O}(\log n)$-rounds despite ${O}(n/\log^{1+\delta} n)$ churn, for
any small constant $\delta > 0$, per round. We assume that the churn is
controlled by an oblivious adversary (that has complete knowledge and control
of what nodes join and leave and at what time, but is oblivious to the random
choices made by the algorithm).
  2. A storage and maintenance algorithm that guarantees (whp) data items can
be efficiently stored (with only $\Theta(\log{n})$ copies of each data item)
and maintained in a dynamic P2P network with churn rate up to
${O}(n/\log^{1+\delta} n)$ per round. Our search algorithm together with our

Coronal X-ray activity cycles have only been discovered in a few stars other
than the Sun, all of them with an older age and a lower activity level than
iota Hor. Aims: We intended to find the X-ray coronal counterpart of the
chromospheric cycle for i Hor. This represents the first X-ray cycle observed
in an active star, as well as the paradigm of the first coronal cycles in the
life of a solar-like star. Methods: We monitored i Hor with XMM-Newton
observations spanning almost two years. The spectra of each observation are fit
with two-temperature coronal models to study the long-term variability of the
star. Results: We find a cyclic behavior in X-rays very similar to the
contemporaneous chromospheric cycle. The continuous chromospheric monitoring
for more than three cycle lengths shows a trend toward decreasing amplitude,
apparently modulated by a longer term trend. The second cycle is disrupted
prior to reaching its maximum, followed by a brief episode of chaotic
variability before the cyclic behavior resumes, only to be disrupted again
after slightly more than one cycle. Conclusions: We confirm the presence of an
activity cycle of ~1.6 yr in i Hor both in X-rays and Ca II H&K. It is likely
subject to the modulation of a longer, not yet constrained second cycle. The
1.6 yr cycle is the shortest coronal one observed to date, and i Hor represents
the most active star for which a coronal activity cycle has been found. This
cycle is probably representative of the first coronal cycles in the life of a
solar-like star, at the age when life started on Earth.

vector regression (SVR) constitute a broad and flexible class of methods which
are theoretically well investigated and commonly used in nonparametric

Tikhonov regularization which is also common in inverse problems, this article
investigates the use of regularized kernel methods for inverse problems in a
unifying way. Regularized kernel methods are based on the use of reproducing
kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) which lead to very good computational properties.
It is shown that similar properties remain true in solving statistical inverse
problems and that standard software implementations developed for ordinary
regression problems can still be used for inverse regression problems.
Consistency of these methods and a rate of convergence for the risk is shown
under quite weak assumptions and rates of convergence for the estimator are

This postfilter is used to jointly suppress late reverberation, residual echo,

result obtains by suppressing both interferences together after the Acoustic
echo cancellation (AEC). The main advantage of this approach is that the
residual echo and noise suppression does not suffer from the existence of a
strong acoustic echo component. Furthermore, the Acoustic echo cancellation
(AEC) does not suffer from the time-varying noise suppression. A disadvantage
is that the input signal of the Acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) has a low

proposed where, apart from the joint suppression, a noise-reduced signal is

determined by the strength of the SO coupling. The modes are constructed

stable, alternating between odd and even shapes, while the simplest single-DW

ground states under the action of the SO coupling. The addition of the Zeeman
splitting transforms the odd modes into asymmetric ones via spontaneous

sourced from chlorophyll a and b. Chlorophyll concentration is normally
measured using a spectrophotometer in laboratory. In some remote observation
places, it is impossible to collect the leaves, preserve them, and bring them
to laboratory to measure their chlorophyll content. Based on this need,
measurement of chlorophyll content is observed through its color. Using CIE
chromaticity diagram leaf color information in RGB is transformed into
wavelength (in nm). Paddy seed with variety name IR-64 is used in observation
during its vegetation stage t (age of 0-10 days). Light exposure time {\tau} is
chosen as environmental change, which normally should be about 12 hours/day, is
varied (0-12 hours/day). Each day sample from different exposure time is taken,
its color is recorded using HP Deskjet 1050 scanner with 1200 dpi, and its
chlorophyll content is obtained from absorption spectrum measured using
Campspec M501 Single Beam UV/Vis Spectrophotometer after it is rinsed in 85 %
acetone solution and the information from the spectrum is calculated using
Arnon method. It has been observed that average wavelength of leaf color
{\lambda}avg is decreased from 570.55 nm to 566.01 nm as is measured for t = 1

increased from 0.015 g/l to 3.250 g/l and from 0.000 g/l to 0.774 g/l for
chlorophyll a and b, respectively. Other value of {\tau} gives similar results.
Based on these results an empirical relation between concentration of

studies for understanding population dynamics. Theory has run ahead of
experiment in solving equations describing ecological systems (the
Lotka-Volterra equations, for example). Modeling approaches depend upon
quantitative knowledge of interaction strengths among species, yet there are
few methods available for estimating strengths of interactions between species,
especially in the field. Competition and predation in fishes is traditionally
studied with a variety of methods, most requiring extensive sampling to
determine stock densities or extensive stomach content or isotope analysis.
Average relative weight of fish species in an ecosystem can usually be
accurately determined with much smaller sample sizes than required for accurate
determination of stock densities. Correlations of mean annual relative weights
may be used to test hypotheses and establish interaction strengths regarding
competition and predation among fishes. The trends are sufficiently suggestive
to use a strong positive correlation as supporting evidence of competition and
possibly indicative of the magnitude of competition if other evidence such as
analysis of stomach contents is also present. Likewise, a strong negative
correlation might be interpreted as relevant when forming a hypothesis of
predation and as supporting evidence of the magnitude of predation if other
evidence is also present. In systems where regular weight and length survey
data are available, this method can suggest the likely strength of competitive
and predatory relationships and may be more cost effective than stomach content
or isotope analysis.

gamma-ray burst (GRB) damped Lyman-alpha absorbers (DLAs), we measure these
ratios using the dust-depletion pattern observed in UV/optical afterglow
spectra associated with the ISM at the GRB host-galaxy redshifts. Our sample
consists of 20 GRB absorbers and a comparison sample of 72 QSO-DLAs with
redshift 1.2 < z < 4.0 and down to Z = 0.002 Z_Sol metallicities. The
dust-to-metal ratio in QSO- and GRB-DLAs increases both with metallicity and
metal column density, spanning ~10--110% of the Galactic value and pointing to
a non universal dust-to-metal ratio. The low values of dust-to-metal ratio
suggest that low-metallicity systems have lower dust fractions than typical
spiral galaxies and perhaps that the dust in these systems is produced
inefficiently, i.e. by grain growth in the low-metallicity regime with
negligible contribution from supernovae (SNe) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB)
stars. On the other hand, some GRB- and QSO-DLAs show high dust-to-metal ratio
values out to z ~ 4, requiring rapid dust production, such as in SN ejecta, but
also in AGB winds and via grain growth for the highest metallicity systems.
GRB-DLAs overall follow the dust-to-metal-ratio properties of QSO-DLAs, GRBs
probing up to larger column and volume densities. For comparison, the
dust-to-metal ratio that we derive for the SMC and LMC are ~82--100% and ~98%
of the Galactic value, respectively. The literature dust-to-metal ratio of the
low-metallicity galaxy I Zw 18 (< 37%) is consistent with the distribution that
we find. The dust extinction Av increases steeply with the column density of
iron in dust, N(Fe)dust, calculated from relative metal abundances, confirming
that dust extinction is mostly occurring in the host galaxy ISM. Most GRB-DLAs
display log N(Fe)dust > 14.7, above which several QSO-DLAs reveal H2
(abridged).

polarized laser field. Starting from the Schroedinger equation, we determine
the states of two-level atoms in a plane-wave field respecting propagation
directions both of the atom and the field. For such laser-driven two-level
atoms, we construct Bessel beams beyond the typical paraxial approximation. We
show that the probability density of these atomic beams obtains a non-trivial,
Bessel-squared-type behavior and can be tuned under the special choice of the
atom and laser parameters, such as the nuclear charge, atom velocity, laser
frequency, and propagation geometry of the atom and laser beams. Moreover, we
spatially and temporally characterize the beam of hydrogen and selected
(neutral) alkali-metal atoms that carry non-zero orbital angular momentum
(OAM). The proposed spatiotemporal Bessel states (i) are able to describe, in
principle, twisted states of any two-level system which is driven by the
radiation field and (ii) have potential applications in atomic, nuclear
processes and quantum communication.

between finite substructures extends to an endomorphism of the structure. This
notion was introduced recently by Cameron and Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il. In this paper
we consider a strengthening of homomorphism-homogeneity --- we call a
relational structure polymorphism-homogeneous if every partial polymorphism
with a finite domain extends to a global polymorphism of the structure. It
turns out that this notion (under various names and in completely different
contexts) has been existing in algebraic literature for at least 30 years.
Motivated by this observation, we dedicate this paper to the topic of
polymorphism-homogeneous structures. We study polymorphism-homogeneity from a
model-theoretic, an algebraic, and a combinatorial point of view. E.g., we
study structures that have quantifier elimination for positive primitive
formulae, and show that this notion is equivalent to polymorphism-homogeneity
for weakly oligomorphic structures. We demonstrate how the Baker-Pixley theorem
can be used to show that polymorphism-homogeneity is a decidable property for
finite relational structures. Eventually, we completely characterize the
countable polymorphism-homogeneous graphs, the polymorphism-homogeneous posets
of arbitrary size, and the countable polymorphism-homogeneous strict posets.

enhance the specular reflection probability for certain angles of incidence in
bilayer-based hybrid structures. When transmission is permitted, the Andreev
reflection manifests itself in isolated peaks and asymmetric resonances

non-equilibrium stationary and even non-stationary processes. The method is
applied to varying quickly the external field in a wide range B=3 <-> 0 for
critical (T=2.269) two-dimensional Ising system of size LxL=128x128. To obtain
free energy differences from the work distributions, they must be studied in
ranges where the probabilities are as small as 10^{-240}, which is not possible
using direct simulation approaches. By comparison with the exact free energies,
which are available for this model for the zero-field case, one sees that the
present approach allows one to obtain the free energy with a very high relative
precision of 10^{-4}. This works well also for non-zero field, i.e., for a case
where standard umbrella-sampling methods seem to be not so efficient to
calculate free energies. Furthermore, for the present case it is verified that
the resulting distributions of work for forward and backward process fulfill
Crooks theorem with high precision. Finally, the free energy for the Ising

are called asperity cells. These asperity cells support much higher failure
stresses than the surrounding regular lattice sites but eventually rupture when
the applied stress reaches their threshold stress. We find that changing the
spatial configuration of those stronger sites generally increases capability of
the fault system to generate larger events, but that the total percentage of
asperities is important as well. We also observe an increasing number of larger
events associated with the total number of asperities in the lattice.

which, on the steady background equilibrium, is ensured by the validity of the

rather natural and it implies that the azimuthal component of the linear plasma
shift is reabsorbed in the expression for the non stationary electric field (in
principle, at any order of approximation) and can no longer provide a non-zero
azimuthal component of the magnetic tension field. As a result, the
Magneto-rotational instability is suppressed and the magnetic field has the
effect to stabilize the plasma configuration with respect to the pure

the influence from different noise regions strongly depends on the

communication systems, cumulative PN that appears near carrier is of relatively
low importance compared to the white PN far from carrier. Our results also show
that 1/f^3 noise is more predictable compared to 1/f^2 noise and in a fair

within the scope of the large-scale interplanetary magnetic field (IMF)
structure investigation. The work is focused on revealing of the radial IMF
component (Br) variations with heliocentric distance and latitude as seen by
Ulysses. It was found out that |Br| decreases as ~r^-5/3 in the ecliptic plane
vicinity (10 deg. of latitude). This is consistent with the previous results
obtained on the basis of five spacecraft in-ecliptic measurements (Khabarova,
Obridko, 2012). The difference between the experimentally found (r^-5/3) and
commonly used (r^-2) radial dependence of Br may lead to mistakes in the IMF
recalculations from point to point in the heliosphere. This can be one of the
main sources of the 'magnetic flux excess' effect, which is exceeding of the
distantly measured magnetic flux over the values obtained through the
measurements at the Earth orbit. It is shown that the radial IMF component can

More detailed analysis demonstrates an expressed |Br| (as well as the IMF
strength) increase in the latitudinal vicinity of 30 deg. relative to the
ecliptic plane. Also, a slight increase of the both parameters is observed in
the polar solar wind. The analysis of the latitudinal and radial dependences of
the Br distribution's bimodality is performed. The investigation has not
revealed any dependence between Br and the solar wind speed V. Meanwhile, the
two-peak distribution of the solar wind speed as measured by Ulysses is a
consequence of a strong latitudinal and solar cycle dependence of V. It is
shown that the solar wind speed in high latitudes (above 40 deg.)
anti-correlates with a solar activity: V is maximal during the solar cycle
minima, and it has a minimum at the maximum of solar activity.

representation of images. The main contribution of this work is to explore the
capabilities of the A Contrario reasoning when applied to the segmentation
problem, and to overcome the limitations of current algorithms within that
framework. This exploratory approach has three main goals.
  Our first goal is to extend the search space of greedy merging algorithms to
the set of all partitions spanned by a certain hierarchy, and to cast the
segmentation as a selection problem within this space. In this way we increase
the number of tested partitions and thus we potentially improve the
segmentation results. In addition, this space is considerably smaller than the
space of all possible partitions, thus we still keep the complexity controlled.
  Our second goal aims to improve the locality of region merging algorithms,
which usually merge pairs of neighboring regions. In this work, we overcome
this limitation by introducing a validation procedure for complete partitions,
rather than for pairs of regions.
  The third goal is to perform an exhaustive experimental evaluation
methodology in order to provide reproducible results.
  Finally, we embed the selection process on a statistical A Contrario
framework which allows us to have only one free parameter related to the
desired scale.

Transcendental equation for transition temperature and expression for the

accurately represent national university systems as their original purpose is
only to rank world-class universities. Another one has to do with the lack of
representativeness of universities' disciplinary profiles as they usually
provide a unique table. Although some rankings offer a great coverage and
others offer league tables by fields, no international ranking does both. In
order to surpass such limitation from a research policy viewpoint, this paper
analyzes the possibility of using national rankings in order to complement
international rankings. For this, we analyze the Spanish university system as a

sampled at stopping times in a nonsynchronous manner. In this article we
establish a central limit theorem for the pre-averaged Hayashi-Yoshida
estimator of their integrated covariance in a general endogenous time setting.
In particular, we show that the time endogeneity has no impact on the
asymptotic distribution of the pre-averaged Hayashi-Yoshida estimator, which
contrasts the case for the realized volatility in a pure diffusion setting. We
also establish a central limit theorem for the modulated realized covariance,
which is another pre-averaging based integrated covariance estimator, and
demonstrate the above property seems to be a special feature of the
pre-averaging technique.

criterion, in measure spaces, for a class of source distributions. The class of
source distributions is described by a relative entropy constraint set between
the true and a nominal distribution. The rate distortion problem for the class
is thus formulated and solved using minimax strategies, which result in robust
source coding with fidelity criterion. It is shown that minimax and maxmin
strategies can be computed explicitly, and they are generalizations of the
classical solution. Finally, for discrete memoryless uncertain sources, the
rate distortion theorem is stated for the class omitting the derivations while
the converse is derived.

strictly hyperbolic operator with Zygmund continuous second order coefficients
both in time and in space. In particular, this estimate implies the
well-posedness for the related Cauchy problem. On the one hand, this result is
quite surprising, because it allows to consider coefficients which are not
Lipschitz continuous in time. On the other hand, it holds true only in the very
special case of initial data in $H^{1/2}\times H^{-1/2}$. Paradifferential
calculus with parameters is the main ingredient to the proof.

acoustic waves through temporal phononic crystals (TPCs), which are designed
structures with periodically time-varying density and bulk modulus. In our
experiment, the TPCs are instanced as the media that swap between air and
carbon dioxide repetitively, in between the sound source and the detector. The
transmission spectra for monochromatic incident acoustic waves exhibit a series
of equidistant peaks, manifesting novel up- and down-conversion effects while
not employing material nonlinearity. These experimental results agree with the
theoretical calculations based on the plane wave expansion in time domain.

integer optimization problems is introduced. The approach is based on the
calculation of a mean field probability distribution for the decision variables
which is consistent with the objective function and the constraints. The
original discrete task is in this way transformed into a continuous variational
problem. In the context of particular problem classes at small and medium
sizes, the mean field results are comparable to those of standard specialized
methods, while at large sized instances is capable to find feasible solutions
in computation times for which standard approaches can't find any valuable
result. The mean field variational framework remains valid for widely diverse
problem structures so it represents a promising paradigm for large dimensional
nonlinear combinatorial optimization tasks.

quantum scalar field, minimally coupled with a spherically symmetric static
Lukewarm black hole. In two dimensional analog the minimal coupling reduces to
the conformal coupling and the stress tensor is found to be determined by the
nonlocal contribution of the anomalous trace and some additional parameters in
close relation to the work presented by Christensen and Fulling. Lukewarm black
holes are a special class of Reissner- Nordstr\""{o}m-de Sitter space times
where its electric charge is equal to its mass. Having the obtained
renormalized stress tensor we attempt to obtain a time-independent solution of
the well known metric back reaction equation. Mathematical derivations predict
that the final state of an evaporating quantum Lukewarm black hole reduces to a
remnant stable mini black hole with moved locations of the horizons. Namely the
perturbed black hole (cosmological) horizon is compressed (extended) to scales
which is smaller (larger) than the corresponding classical radius of the event
horizons. Hence there is not obtained an deviation on the cosmic sensor-ship
hypothesis.

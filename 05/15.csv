pulsar timing arrays enter a new regime where the signal to noise only scales
as $\sqrt{T}$. In addition, in this regime the quality of the pulsar timing
data and the cadence become relatively un-important. This occurs because the
lowest frequencies of the pulsar timing residuals become gravitational-wave
dominated. Pulsar timing arrays enter this regime more quickly than one might
naively suspect. For T=10 yr observations and typical stochastic background
amplitudes, pulsars with residual RMSs of less than about $1\,\mu$s are already
in that regime. The best strategy to increase the detectability of the
background in this regime is to increase the number of pulsars in the array. We
also perform realistic simulations of the NANOGrav pulsar timing array, which
through an aggressive pulsar survey campaign adds new millisecond pulsars
regularly to its array, and show that a detection is possible within a decade,

the East West equator of the Sun in accordance with Joys law that describes the
average tilt angle as a function of latitude. Mt. Wilson observatory data from
1917 to 1985 are used to analyze the active-region tilt angle as a function of
solar cycle, hemisphere, and longitude, in addition to the more common
dependence on latitude. Our main results are as follows: i) We recommend a
revision of Joys law toward a weaker dependence on latitude (slope of 0.13 to
0.26) and without forcing the tilt to zero at the Equator. ii) We determine
that the hemispheric mean tilt value of active regions varies with each solar
cycle, although the noise from a stochastic process dominates and does not
allow for a determination of the slope of Joys law on an 11-year time scale.
iii) The hemispheric difference in mean tilt angles, 1.1 degrees + 0.27, over
Cycles 16 to 21 was significant to a three-sigma level, with average tilt
angles in the northern and southern hemispheres of 4.7 degrees + 0.26 and 3.6
degrees + 0.27 respectively. iv) Area-weighted mean tilt angles normalized by
latitude for Cycles 15 to 21 anticorrelate with cycle strength for the southern
hemisphere and whole-Sun data, confirming previous results by Dasi-Espuig,
Solanki, Krivova, et al. (2010, Astron. Astrophys. 518, A7). The northern
hemispheric mean tilt angles do not show a dependence on cycle strength. vi)
Mean tilt angles do not show a dependence on longitude for any hemisphere or
cycle. In addition, the standard deviation of the mean tilt is 29 to 31 degrees
for all cycles and hemispheres indicating that the scatter is due to the same
consistent process even if the mean tilt angles vary.

systematic approach to consistently resumming non-perturbative effects in
Quantum Thermal Field Theory. One major limitation of the CJT effective action
is that its loopwise expansion introduces residual violations of possible
global symmetries, thus giving rise to massive Goldstone bosons in the
spontaneously broken phase of the theory. In this paper we develop a novel
symmetry-improved CJT formalism for consistently encoding global symmetries in
a loopwise expansion. In our formalism, the extremal solutions of the fields
and propagators to a loopwise truncated CJT effective action are subject to
additional constraints given by the Ward identities due to global symmetries.
By considering a simple O(2) scalar model, we show that, unlike other methods,
our approach satisfies a number of important field-theoretic properties. In
particular, we find that the Goldstone boson resulting from spontaneous
symmetry breaking of O(2) is massless and the phase transition is a second
order one, already in the Hartree-Fock approximation. After taking the sunset
diagrams into account, we show how our approach properly describes the
threshold properties of the massless Goldstone boson and the Higgs particle in
the loops. Finally, assuming minimal modifications to the Hartree-Fock
approximated CJT effective action, we calculate the corresponding
symmetry-improved CJT effective potential and discuss the conditions for its
uniqueness for scalar-field values away from its minimum.

the assumption of perfect quasi-static dynamics. As a consequence of this
assumption, ideal engines operate at the maximum efficiency but have zero
power. Realistic engines, on the other hand, operate in finite-time and are
intrinsically irreversible, implying friction effects at short cycle times. The
engineering goal is to find the maximum efficiency allowed at the maximum
possible power. In the current technological age, with our ability to
manipulate devices at the nanoscale and beyond, one must understand the
consequences of engines which operate at the quantum mechanical level. In this
domain one cannot avoid the emergence of both quantum and thermal fluctuations
which drastically alter the energetics of the cycle. Very recently, it has been
shown that the Hamiltonian of a quantum system may be manipulated in such a way
as to mimic an adiabatic process via a non-adiabatic shortcut. A surge of
experimental progress has demonstrated several of these proposals in the
laboratory. In this paper we show that, by utilising shortcuts to adiabaticity
in a quantum engine cycle, one can engineer a thermodynamical cycle working at
finite power and zero friction. Our findings are elucidated using a harmonic

  Specifically, we first develop conditions under which optimum

we are to achieve any nontrivial rate with vanishing probability of error over
the binary erasure or binary symmetric channels. Moreover, we show there exist
capacity-achieving codes with this scaling.
  With respect to local repairability, we develop tight upper and lower bounds
on the number of remaining encoded bits that are needed to recover a single
lost bit of the encoding. In particular, we show that if the code-rate is
$\epsilon$ less than the capacity, then for optimal codes, the maximum number

$\log1/\epsilon$.

with host star mass, a clue to how planets like Jupiter form. One missing piece
of the puzzle is the occurrence around late K dwarf stars (masses of
0.5-0.75Msun and effective temperatures of 3900-4800K). We analyzed four years
of Doppler radial velocities data of 110 late K dwarfs, one of which hosts two
previously reported giant planets. We estimate that 4.0+/-2.3% of these stars
have Saturn-mass or larger planets with orbital periods <245d, depending on the
planet mass distribution and RV variability of stars without giant planets. We
also estimate that 0.7+/-0.5% of similar stars observed by Kepler have giant
planets. This Kepler rate is significantly (99% confidence) lower than that
derived from our Doppler survey, but the difference vanishes if only the single
Doppler system (HIP 57274) with completely resolved orbits is considered. The
difference could also be explained by the exclusion of close binaries (without
giant planets) from the Doppler but not Kepler surveys, the effect of
long-period companions and stellar noise on the Doppler data, or an intrinsic
difference between the two populations. Our estimates for late K dwarfs bridge
those for solar-type stars and M dwarfs and support a positive trend with
stellar mass. Small sample size precludes statements about finer structure,
e.g. a ""shoulder"" in the distribution of giant planets with stellar mass.
Future surveys such as the Next Generation Transit Survey and the Transiting

therefore spin), only a slight inverse correlation is found between the
Doppler-corrected radio luminosity at 5 GHz (a proxy for jet power) and line
width. When the Seyfert reflection features are fit with
relativistically-blurred disk reflection models that measure spin, there is a
tentative positive correlation between the Doppler-corrected radio luminosity
and the spin measurement. Further, when we include stellar-mass black holes in
the sample, to examine the effects across the mass scale, we find a slightly
stronger correlation with radio luminosity per unit mass and spin, at a
marginal significance (2.3 sigma confidence level). Finally, when we include
neutron stars, in order to probe lower spin values, we find a positive
correlation (3.3 sigma confidence level) between radio luminosity per unit mass

in determining the jet luminosity. In addition, we find a slightly more

per Bolometric luminosity and spin, using our entire sample of black holes and
neutrons stars. Again, although tentative, these relations point to the
possibility that the mass accretion rate, i.e. Bolometric luminosity, is also
important in determining the jet luminosity, in addition to spin. Our analysis
suggests that mass accretion rate and disk or coronal magnetic field strength
may be the ""throttle"" in these compact systems, to which the Eddington limit

  affine morphisms","44 pages, the final version","Journal of the EMS, 20 (2018) 15-59",,,"math.AG math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An enumerative problem on a variety $V$ is usually solved by reduction to
intersection theory in the cohomology of a compactification of $V$. However, if
the problem is invariant under a ""nice"" group action on $V$ (so that $V$ is
spherical), then many authors suggested a better home for intersection theory:
the direct limit of the cohomology rings of all equivariant compactifications
of $V$. We call this limit the affine cohomology of $V$ and construct affine
characteristic classes of subvarieties of a complex torus, taking values in the
affine cohomology of the torus.
  This allows us to make the first steps in computing affine Thom polynomials.
Classical Thom polynomials count how many fibers of a generic proper map of a
smooth variety have a prescribed collection of singularities, and our affine
version addresses the same question for generic polynomial maps of affine
algebraic varieites. This notion is also motivated by developing an
intersection-theoretic approach to tropical correspondence theorems: they can
be reduced to the computation of affine Thom polynomials, because the
fundamental class of a variety in the affine cohomology is encoded by the
tropical fan of this variety.
  The first concrete answer that we obtain is the affine version of what were,
historically speaking, the first three Thom poylnomials -- the Plucker formulas
for the degree and the number of cusps and nodes of a projectively dual curve.
This, in particular, classifies toric varieties, whose projective dual is a
hypersurface, computes the tropical fan of the variety of double tangent
hyperplanes to a toric variety, and describes the Newton polytope of the
hypersurface of non-Morse polynomials of a given degree. We also make a
conjecture on the general form of affine Thom polynomials -- a key ingredient
is the $n$-ary fan, generalizing the secondary polytope.

probability distributions established from hydrogen-atmosphere spectral fits of
quiescent sources, we apply this model to compute alternate sets of probability
distributions. We perform Bayesian analyses to estimate neutron star
mass-radius curves and equation of state (EOS) parameters that best-fit each
set of distributions, assuming the existence of a known low-density neutron
star crustal EOS, a simple model for the high-density EOS, causality, and the
observation that the neutron star maximum mass exceeds $2~M_\odot$. We compute
the posterior probabilities for each set of distance measurements and
assumptions about absorption and composition. We find that, within the context
of our assumptions and our parameterized EOS models, some absorption models are
disfavored. We find that neutron stars composed of hadrons are favored relative
to those with exotic matter with strong phase transitions. In addition, models
in which all five stars have hydrogen atmospheres are found to be weakly
disfavored. Our most likely models predict neutron star radii that are

on the idea of an inverse renormalization group strategy. With this strategy we
construct the multivariate distributions of elementary returns based on the
scaling with time of the probability density of their aggregates. In its
simplest version the model is the product of an endogenous auto-regressive
component and a random rescaling factor designed to embody also exogenous
influences. Mathematical properties like increments' stationarity and
ergodicity can be proven. Thanks to the relatively low number of parameters,
model calibration can be conveniently based on a method of moments, as
exemplified in the case of historical data of the S&P500 index. The calibrated
model accounts very well for many stylized facts, like volatility clustering,
power law decay of the volatility autocorrelation function, and multiscaling
with time of the aggregated return distribution. In agreement with empirical
evidence in finance, the dynamics is not invariant under time reversal and,
with suitable generalizations, skewness of the return distribution and leverage
effects can be included. The analytical tractability of the model opens
interesting perspectives for applications, for instance in terms of obtaining
closed formulas for derivative pricing. Further important features are: The
possibility of making contact, in certain limits, with auto-regressive models
widely used in finance; The possibility of partially resolving the long-memory
and short-memory components of the volatility, with consistent results when
applied to historical series.

predicting huge class of physical phenomena. Ironically, in spite of all its
successes, there is a notorious problem: how does Nature create a ''bridge''
from fragile quanta to the robust, objective world of everyday experience? It
is now commonly accepted that the most promising approach is the Decoherence
Theory, based on the system-environment paradigm. To explain the observed
redundancy and objectivity of information in the classical realm, Zurek
proposed to divide the environment into independent fractions and argued that
each of them carries a nearly complete classical information about the system.
This Quantum Darwinism model has nevertheless some serious drawbacks: i) the
entropic information redundancy is motivated by a priori purely classical
reasoning; ii) there is no answer to the basic question: what physical process
makes the transition from quantum description to classical objectivity
possible? Here we prove that the necessary and sufficient condition for
objective existence of a state is the spectrum broadcasting process, which, in
particular, implies Quantum Darwinism. We first show it in general, using
multiple environments paradigm, a suitable definition of objectivity, and
Bohr's notion of non-disturbance, and then on the emblematic example for
Decoherence Theory: a dielectric sphere illuminated by photons. We also apply
Perron-Frobenius Theorem to show a faithful, ''decoherence-free'' form of
broadcasting. We suggest that the spectrum broadcasting might be one of the
foundational properties of Nature, which opens a ''window'' for life processes.

logic. They admit two notions of morphism: logical morphisms which preserve all
of the structure and therefore the interpretation of higher order logic, and
geometric morphisms which only preserve only some of the structure and
therefore only some of the interpretation of higher order logic. The question
then arises: what kinds of higher order theories are preserved by geometric
morphisms? It is known that certain first order theories called internal
geometric theories are preserved by geometric morphisms, and these admit what
are known as classifying topoi. Briefly, a classifying topos for an internal
geometric theory $\mathbb{T}$ in a topos $\mathcal{E}$ is a topos
$\mathcal{E}[\mathbb{T}]$ such that models of $\mathbb{T}$ in any topos
$\mathcal{F}$ with a geometric morphism to $\mathcal{E}$ are in one to one
correspondence with geometric morphisms from $\mathcal{F}$ to
$\mathcal{E}[\mathbb{T}]$ over $\mathcal{E}$. One useful technique for showing
that a higher order theory $\mathcal{T}$ is preserved by geometric morphisms is
to define an internal geometric theory $\mathbb{T}$ of ""bad sets"" for
$\mathcal{T}$ and show that $\mathcal{T}$ is equivalent to the higher order
theory which says ""the classifying topos for $\mathbb{T}$ is degenerate"". We
set up a deduction calculus for internal geometric theories and show that it
proves a contradiction if and only if the classifying topos of that theory is
degenerate. We use this result to study a variant of the higher order theory of
Dedekind finite objects and the higher order theory of field objects considered

for substellar evolution and ultracool atmospheres at lower surface gravities

we conclude the ""underluminosity"" of the young planetary-mass companions HR

free-floating brown dwarfs, though the effect is not as extreme. At the same
time, some young objects over the full spectral type range of our sample are
similar to field objects, and thus a simple correspondence between youth and
magnitude offset relative to the field population appears to be lacking.
Comparing the kinematics of our sample to nearby stellar associations and
moving groups, we identify several new moving group members, including the
first free-floating L dwarf in the AB Dor moving group, 2MASS J0355+11.
Altogether, the effects of surface gravity (age) and dust content on the

planets with low geometric albedos (<0.3). For TrES-2 and KOI-13, the Kepler

Seyfert 1s (NLSy1s) have been considered a special class of active galactic
nuclei (AGN). Here, we summarize observational results from different groups to
conclude that none of the characteristics that are typically used to define the
NLSy1s as a distinct group - from the, nowadays called, Broad Line Seyfert 1s
(BLSy1s) - is unique, nor ubiquitous of these particular sources, but shared by
the whole Type 1 AGN. Historically, the NLSy1s have been distinguished from the
BLSy1s by the narrow width of the broad Hbeta emission line. The upper limit on
the full width at half maximum of this line is 2000 km/s for NLSy1s, while in
BLSy1s it can be of several thousands of km/s. However, this border has been
arbitrarily set and does not correspond to the change of any physical property.
All observed parameters in Type 1 AGN cover continues ranges of values, which
does not allow to infer the existence of two different kind of populations with
FWHM(Hbeta,broad) = 2000 km/s as dividing point. We argue that the usage of
this velocity limit to define samples of NLSy1s galaxies - as it is usually
done in comparative studies -, together with the well known observational
biases, naturally favors the selection of sources with low black hole masses
and high Eddington ratios that are hosted by blue spiral galaxies. Therefore
selection biases might be responsible for the reported differences between
NLSy1 and BLSy1 sources.

the light of recent Higgs measurements, mainly its di-photon decay rate, where
the data might indicate a slight excess over the SM prediction. That excess
could be fitted by the contribution of light charginos provided tan(beta) is
low to moderate, a possibility that is receiving much attention for other
theoretical reasons. We investigate the implications of this scenario for other
observables, such as dark matter constraints, electroweak observables and
experimental signals at the LHC, like di-lepton, tri-lepton and same-sign
dilepton. An important part of the models survive all the constraints and are

particles of an N-body system has on the rate of two-body relaxation. To this
end, we derive an accretion-modified relaxation time by adapting Spitzer's
two-component model to include the damping effects of accretion. We consider
several different mass-dependencies and efficiency factors for the accretion
rate, as well as different mass ratios for the two components of the model.
  The net effect of accretion is to accelerate mass segregation by increasing
the average mass $\bar{m}$, since the relaxation time is inversely proportional
to $\bar{m}$. Under the assumption that the accretion rate increases with the
accretor mass, there are two additional effects that accelerate mass
segregation. First, accretion acts to increase the range of any initial mass
spectrum, quickly driving the heaviest members to even higher masses. Second,
accretion acts to reduce the velocities of the accretors due to conservation of
momentum, and it is the heaviest members that are affected the most. Using our
two-component model, we quantify these effects as a function of the accretion
rate, the total cluster mass, and the component masses. We conclude by
discussing the implications of our results for the dynamical evolution of
primordial globular clusters, primarily in the context of black holes formed
from the most massive stellar progenitors.

structure formation, we carry out a suite of high-resolution Adaptive Mesh
Refinement (AMR) cosmological simulations, which use Smoothed Particle
Hydrodynamic datasets as initial conditions, converted using a new tool
developed for this work. These simulations resolve structures with masses as
small as a few 100 M$_\odot$, and we focus on the $10^6$ M$_\odot$ ""mini-halos""
in which the first stars formed. At $z \approx 17,$ the presence of stream
velocities has only a minor effect on the number density of halos below $10^6$
M$_\odot$, but it greatly suppresses gas accretion onto all halos and the dark
matter structures around them. Stream velocities lead to significantly lower
halo gas fractions, especially for $\approx 10^5$ M$_\odot$ objects, an effect
that is likely to depend on the orientation of a halo's accretion lanes. This
reduction in gas density leads to colder, more compact radial profiles, and it
substantially delays the redshift of collapse of the largest halos, leading to
delayed star formation and possibly delayed reionization. These many
differences suggest that future simulations of early cosmological structure
formation should include stream velocities to properly predict gas evolution,
star-formation, and the epoch of reionization.

this fact to show that the phases of non-abelian GLSMs can be obtained from the
secondary fan of the associated abelian GLSM. We prove that the partition
function of any abelian GLSM satisfies a set of linear differential equations;
these reduce to the familiar A-hypergeometric system of Gel'fand, Kapranov, and
Zelevinski for GLSMs describing complete intersections in toric varieties. We
develop a set of conditions that are necessary for a GLSM phase to admit an
interpretation as the low-energy limit of a non-linear sigma model with a
Calabi-Yau threefold target space. Through the application of these criteria we
discover a class of GLSMs with novel geometric phases corresponding to
Calabi-Yau manifolds that are branched double-covers of Fano threefolds. These
criteria provide a promising approach for constructing new Calabi-Yau
geometries.

time disperses due to photoevaporation, accretion, and possibly planet
formation. The accretion shock on the central star produces an UV/optical
veiling continuum, line emission, and X-ray signatures. As the accretion rate
decreases, the impact on the central star must change. In this article we study
MN Lup, a young star where no indications of a disk are seen in IR
observations. We present XMM-Newton and VLT/UVES observations, some of them
taken simultaneously. The X-ray data show that MN Lup is an active star with
L_X/L_bol close to the saturation limit. However, we find high densities (n_e >
3e10 /cm^3) in the X-ray grating spectrum. This can be well fitted using an
accretion shock model with an accretion rate of 2e-11 M_sun/yr. Despite the
simple Halpha line profile which has a broad component, but no absorption
signatures as typically seen on accreting TTS, we find rotational modulation in
Ca II K and in photospheric absorption lines. In the Halpha line we see a
prominence in absorption about 2R_* above the stellar surface - the first of
its kind on a TTS. MN Lup is also the only TTS where accretion is seen, but no
dust disk is detected that could fuel it. We suggest that MN Lup presents a
unique and short-lived state in the disk evolution. It may have lost its dust
disk only recently and is now accreting the remaining gas at a very low rate.

its binary companion ADS 16402 A, which provides an excellent photometric
reference, simplifying the usual steps in removing instrumental artifacts from
HST time-series photometry. We find that without this reference star, we would
need to detrend the lightcurve with the time of the exposures as well as the
first three powers of HST orbital phase, and this would introduce a strong bias
in the results for the albedo. However, with this reference star, we only need
to detrend the data with the time of the exposures to achieve the same

the global structure of these networks which usually display a hierarchical
spatial organization. The link between local constraints and large-scale

the growth of spatial networks based on the general concept of cost benefit
analysis. This model depends essentially on one single scale and produces a
family of networks which range from the star-graph to the minimum spanning tree
and which are characterised by a continuously varying exponent. We show that
spatial hierarchy emerges naturally, with structures composed of various hubs
controlling geographically separated service areas, and appears as a
large-scale consequence of local cost-benefit considerations. Our model thus
provides the first building blocks for a better understanding of the evolution
of spatial networks and their properties. We also find that, surprisingly, the
average detour is minimal in the intermediate regime, as a result of a large
diversity in link lengths. Finally, we estimate the important parameters for
various world railway networks and find that --remarkably-- they all fall in
this intermediate regime, suggesting that spatial hierarchy is a crucial

variability down to timescales of hundreds of seconds. The UV-to-X-ray spectrum
of GSN 069 is consistent with a pure accretion disc model which implies an
Eddington ratio of ~0.5 and a black hole mass of ~ 1.2 million solar masses. A
new optical spectrum, obtained ~3.5 months after the XMM-Newton slew detection,
is consistent with earlier spectra and lacks any broad line component,
classifying the source as a Seyfert 2 galaxy. The lack of cold X-ray absorption

conventional quantum mechanics and quantum computation emerge locally (though

needed to describe the system and the size of the second quantifies the

sensitive room-temperature detection of THz is notoriously difficult. The
hot-electron photothermoelectric effect in graphene is a promising detection
mechanism: photoexcited carriers rapidly thermalize due to strong
electron-electron interactions, but lose energy to the lattice more slowly. The
electron temperature gradient drives electron diffusion, and asymmetry due to
local gating or dissimilar contact metals produces a net current via the
thermoelectric effect. Here we demonstrate a graphene thermoelectric THz
photodetector with sensitivity exceeding 10 V/W (700 V/W) at room temperature
and noise equivalent power less than 1100 pW/Hz^1/2 (20 pW/Hz^1/2), referenced
to the incident (absorbed) power. This implies a performance which is
competitive with the best room-temperature THz detectors for an optimally
coupled device, while time-resolved measurements indicate that our graphene
detector is eight to nine orders of magnitude faster than those. A simple model
of the response, including contact asymmetries (resistance, work function and
Fermi-energy pinning) reproduces the qualitative features of the data, and
indicates that orders-of-magnitude sensitivity improvements are possible.

commensurate ($q=0$) nematic order, and two incommensurate nematic phases with
modulation wavevectors that are either axial or oriented along the Brillouin

clouds. Experiments and observations have shown that the ice is significantly
processed after the freeze-out of molecules onto grains. The processing is
caused by cosmic-ray particles and cosmic-ray-induced UV photons. These
transformations are included in current astrochemical models only to a very
limited degree. Aims. We aim to establish a model of the ""cold"" chemistry in
interstellar ices and to evaluate its general impact on the composition of
interstellar ices. Methods. The ice was treated as consisting of two layers -
the surface and the mantle (or subsurface) layer. Subsurface chemical processes
are described with photodissociation of ice species and binary reactions on the
surfaces of cavities inside the mantle. Hydrogen atoms and molecules can
diffuse between the layers. We also included deuterium chemistry. Results. The
modeling results show that the content of chemically bound H is reduced in
subsurface molecules by about 30 % on average. This promotes the formation of
more hydrogen-poor species in the ice. The enrichment of ice molecules with
deuterium is significantly reduced by the subsurface processes. On average, it
follows the gas-phase atomic D-to-H abundance ratio, with a delay. The delay
produced by the model is on the order of several Myr. Conclusions. The
processing of ice may place new constraints on the production of deuterated
species on grains. In a mantle with a two-layer structure the upper layer (CO)
should be processed substantially more intensively than the lower layer (H2O).
Chemical explosions in interstellar ice might not be an important process. They
destroy the structure of the mantle, which forms over long timescales. Besides,
ices may lack the high radical content needed for the explosions.

consider its application to linear interference suppression in direct-sequence
ultra-wideband (DS-UWB) systems. Firstly, we investigate a generic reduced-rank
scheme that jointly optimizes a projection vector and a reduced-rank filter by
using the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) criterion. Then a low-complexity
scheme, denoted switched approximation of adaptive basis functions (SAABF), is
proposed. The SAABF scheme is an extension of the generic scheme, in which the
complexity reduction is achieved by using a multi-branch framework to simplify
the structure of the projection vector. Adaptive implementations for the SAABF
scheme are developed by using least-mean squares (LMS) and recursive
least-squares (RLS) algorithms. We also develop algorithms for selecting the
branch number and the model order of the SAABF scheme. Simulations show that in
the scenarios with severe inter-symbol interference (ISI) and multiple access
interference (MAI), the proposed SAABF scheme has fast convergence and
remarkable interference suppression performance with low complexity.

for high luminosity stellar mass black hole X-ray binary systems. We first use
a dissipation profile based on scaling the results of shearing box simulations
of Hirose et al. (2009) to a range of annuli parameters. We simultaneously
scale the effective temperature, orbital frequency and surface density with
luminosity and radius according to the standard \alpha-model (Shakura &
Sunyaev, 1973). This naturally brings increased dissipation to the disk surface
layers (around the photospheres) at small radii and high luminosities. We find
that the local spectrum transitions directly from a modified black body to a
saturated Compton scattering spectrum as we increase the effective temperature
and orbital frequency while decreasing midplane surface density. Next, we
construct annuli models based on the parameters of a L/L_Edd=0.8 disk orbiting
a 6.62 solar mass black hole using two modified dissipation profiles that
explicitly put more dissipation per unit mass near the disk surface. The new
dissipation profiles are qualitatively similar to the one found by Hirose et
al. (2009), but produce strong near power-law spectral tails. Our models also
include physically motivated magnetic acceleration support based once again on
scaling the Hirose et al. (2009) results. We present three full-disk spectra
each based on one of the dissipation prescriptions. Our most aggressive
dissipation profile results in a disk spectrum that is in approximate
quantitative agreement with certain observations of the steep power law (SPL)
spectral states from some black hole X-ray binaries.

made at four microwave frequencies (\omega/2\pi = 2.64, 4.51, 9.12 and 13.97
GHz), for magnetic fields ranging from 0 to 7 T. From these data we obtain the
field, frequency and temperature dependence of the vortex viscosity, pinning
constant, depinning frequency and flux-flow resistivity. The vortex viscosity,
\eta(\omega,T), has a surprisingly strong frequency dependence and bears a
striking resemblance to the zero-field quasiparticle conductivity,
\sigma_qp(\omega,T), suggesting that the dominant dissipative mechanism for the
flux lines is induced electric fields coupling to bulk, long-lived d-wave
quasiparticles outside the vortex cores. This is in sharp contrast to the
conventional Bardeen-Stephen picture, in which dissipation takes place inside
quasi-normal vortex cores. The strong frequency dependence of the vortex
viscosity in the microwave range requires us to treat it as a complex response
function, with an imaginary part that is predicted to contribute to the
apparent pinning force on the vortices. Measurements of the frequency
dependence of the pinning force confirm that this term is present, and in a
form consistent with the requirements of causality. At low temperatures the
flux-flow resistivity, \rho_ff \propto 1/\eta, has the form \rho_ff(T) = \rho_0

current questions of star formation. To better understand the process of star
and cluster formation, we need to study in detail the physical structure and
properties of the parental molecular cloud. The Spokes cluster, or NGC 2264 D,
is a rich protostellar cluster where previous N2H+(1-0) observations of its
dense cores presented linewidths consistent with supersonic turbulence.
However, the fragmentation of the most massive of these cores appears to have a
scale length consistent with that of the thermal Jeans length, suggesting that
turbulence was not dominant. Aims. These two results probe different density
regimes. Our aim is to determine if there is subsonic or less-turbulent gas
(than previously reported) in the Spokes cluster at higher densities. Methods.
We present APEX N2H+(3-2) and N2D+(3-2) observations of the NGC2264-D region to
measure the linewidths and the deuteration fraction of the higher density gas.
The critical densities of the selected transitions are more than an order of
magnitude higher than that of N2H+(1-0). Results. We find that the N2H+(3-2)
and N2D+(3-2) emission present significantly narrower linewidths than the
emission from N2H+(1-0) for most cores. In two of the spectra, the nonthermal
component is close (within 1-sigma) to the sound speed. In addition, we find
that the three spatially segregated cores, for which no protostar had been
confirmed show the highest levels of deuteration. Conclusions. These results
show that the higher density gas, probed with N2H+ and N2D+(3-2), reveals more
quiescent gas in the Spokes cluster than previously reported. More high-angular
resolution interferometric observations using high-density tracers are needed
to truly assess the kinematics and substructure within NGC2264-D. (Abridged)

realizes integration of physical world with the cyber ones. One of the most
promising is the Internet of Things (IoT), a vision in which the Internet
extends into our daily activities through wireless networks of uniquely
identifiable objects. Given that modern RFID systems are being deployed in
large-scale for different applications, without optimizing reader's
distribution, many of the readers will be redundant, resulting waste of energy.
Additionally, eliminating redundant eaders can also decrease probability of
reader collisions, as a result, enhancing system performance and efficiency. In
this paper, an overlap aware (OA) technique is proposed for eliminating
redundant readers. The OA is a distributed approach, which does not need to
collect global information for centralizing control, aims to detect maximum
amount of redundant readers could be safely removed or turned off with
preserving original RFID network coverage. A significant improvement of the OA
scheme is that the amount of ""write-to-tag"" operations could be largely reduced
during the redundant reader identification phase. In order to accurately
evaluate the performance of the proposed method, it was performed in a variety
of scenarios. The experiment results show that the proposed method can provide
reliable performance with detecting higher redundancy and has lower algorithm
overheads as compared with several well known methods, such as the RRE, LEO,
the hybrid algorithm (LEO+RRE) and the DRRE.

non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function can be the spectrum of a
self-adjoint operator. So far no such operator was found. However the
suggestion of Hilbert and P\'olya, in the context of spectral theory, can be
extended to approach other problems and so it is natural to ask if there is a
quantum mechanical system related to other sequences of numbers which are
originated and motivated by Number Theory.
  In this paper we show that the functional integrals associated with a
hypothetical class of physical systems described by self-adjoint operators
associated with bosonic fields whose spectra is given by three different
sequence of numbers cannot be constructed. The common feature of the sequence
of numbers considered here, which causes the impossibility of zeta
regularization, is that the various Dirichlet series attached to such sequences
- such as those which are sums over ""primes"" of $(\mathrm{norm} \ P)^{-s}$ have
a natural boundary, i.e., they cannot be continued beyond the line
$\mathrm{Re}(s)=0$. The main argument is that once the regularized determinant
of a Laplacian is meromorphic in $s$, it follows that the series considered
above cannot be a regularized determinant. In other words we show that the
generating functional of connected Schwinger functions of the associated
quantum field theories cannot be constructed.

Thus, all the active femtocells are located in the poor macrocell coverage

279 at 1.3 mm (230 GHz) in 2011. The measured nonzero closure phases on
triangles including stations in Arizona, California and Hawaii indicate that
the source structure is spatially resolved. We find an unusual inner jet
direction at scales of $\sim$1 parsec extending along the northwest-southeast
direction (PA = $127^{\circ}\pm3^{\circ}$), as opposed to other (previously)
reported measurements on scales of a few parsecs showing inner jet direction
extending to the southwest. The 1.3 mm structure corresponds closely with that
observed in the central region of quasi-simultaneous super-resolution VLBA
images at 7 mm. The closure phase changed significantly on the last day when
compared with the rest of observations, indicating that the inner jet structure
may be variable on daily timescales. The observed new direction of the inner
jet shows inconsistency with the prediction of a class of jet precession
models. Our observations indicate a brightness temperature of $\sim
8\times10^{10}$ K in the 1.3 mm core, much lower than that at centimeter
wavelengths. Observations with better uv coverage and sensitivity in the coming
years will allow the discrimination between different structure models and will
provide direct images of the inner regions of the jet with 20--30 $\mu$as (5--7
light months) resolution.

  (ISIT) 2013",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Diversity-multiplexing trade-off has been studied extensively to quantify the
benefits of different relaying strategies in terms of error and rate
performance. However, even in the case of a single half-duplex relay, which
seems fully characterized, implications are not clear. When all channels in the
system are assumed to be independent and identically fading, a fixed schedule
where the relay listens half of the total duration for communication and
transmits the second half combined with quantize-map-and-forward relaying
(static QMF) is known to achieve the full-duplex performance [1]. However, when
there is no direct link between the source and the destination, a dynamic
decode-and-forward (DDF) strategy is needed [2]. It is not clear which one of
these two conclusions would carry to a less idealized setup, where the direct
link can be neither as strong as the other links nor fully non-existent.
  In this paper, we provide a generalized diversity-multiplexing trade-off for
the half-duplex relay channel which accounts for different channel strengths
and recovers the two earlier results as two special cases. We show that these
two strategies are sufficient to achieve the diversity-multiplexing trade-off
across all channel configurations, by characterizing the best achievable
trade-off when channel state information (CSI) is only available at the
receivers (CSIR). However, for general relay networks we show that a
generalization of these two schemes through a dynamic QMF strategy is needed to
achieve optimal performance.

The hourly wind
speed data were generally required for precisely wind erosion modeling. In this

  A typical windy location with 3285 days (9 years) measured hourly wind speed
data were used to validate the downscaling method. The results showed that the
overall agreement between observed and simulated cumulative wind speed
probability distributions appears excellent, especially for the wind speeds
greater than 5 m s-1 range (erosive wind speed). The results further revealed
that the values of daily average erosive wind power density (AWPD) calculated
from generated wind speeds fit the counterparts computed from measured wind
speeds well with high models' efficiency (Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient). So that
the hourly wind speed data can be predicted from daily average and maximum wind

for general $L-$channel MD problem, based on a technique called `Combinatorial
Message Sharing' (CMS), where every subset of the descriptions shares a
distinct common message. The new achievable region subsumes the most well known
region for the general problem, due to Venkataramani, Kramer and Goyal (VKG)
[2]. Moreover, we showed in [3] that the new scheme provides a strict
improvement of the achievable region for any source and distortion measures for
which some 2-description subset is such that the Zhang and Berger (ZB) scheme
achieves points outside the El-Gamal and Cover (EC) region. In this paper, we
show a more surprising result: CMS outperforms VKG for a general class of
sources and distortion measures, which includes scenarios where for all
2-description subsets, the ZB and EC regions coincide. In particular, we show
that CMS strictly extends VKG region, for the $L$-channel quadratic Gaussian MD
problem for all $L\geq3$, despite the fact that the EC region is complete for
the corresponding 2-descriptions problem. Using the encoding principles
derived, we show that the CMS scheme achieves the complete rate-distortion
region for several asymmetric cross-sections of the $L-$channel quadratic

supposedd that under the basic hypothesis the trend coefficient depends on the

The underlying statistics depends on the deviation of the local time estimator
from the invariant density with parameter replaced by the maximum likelihood

the test statistics to the integral of Wiener process. Therefore the test based

stable phase control mechanisms are necessary but are difficult to achieve
because the total amount of optical loss to the entangled beams needs to be
small. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a control scheme for two-mode
squeezed vacuum states at the telecommunication wavelength of 1550 nm. Our
states exhibited an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen covariance product of 0.0309 \pm

Specifically, we represent users' behavior patterns based on topological graph

rating values. In the next step we find a correlation between behavior patterns
in the source domain and behavior patterns in the target domain. This mapping
is considered a bridge between the two domains. Based on the correlation and

strong diffuse neutron scattering is observed, which hints at short-range

with their red-supergiant (RSG) star progenitors. Using MESA STAR, we modulate
the parameters (e.g., mixing length, overshoot, rotation, metallicity) that
control the evolution of a 15Msun main-sequence star to produce a variety of
physical pre-SN models and SN II-P ejecta. We extend previous modeling of SN
II-P radiation to include photospheric and nebular phases, as well as
multi-band light curves and spectra. Our treatment does not assume local
thermodynamic equilibrium, is time dependent, treats explicitly the effects of
line blanketing, and incorporates non-thermal processes. We find that the color
properties of SNe II-P require large model atoms for FeI and FeII, much larger
than adopted in Dessart & Hillier (2011). The color properties also imply RSG
progenitors of limited extent (~500Rsun) --- larger progenitor stars produce a
SN II-P radiation that remains too blue for too long. This finding calls for a
reduction of RSG radii, perhaps through a strengthening of convective energy
transport in RSG envelopes. Increased overshoot and rotation reduce the ratio
of ejecta to helium-core mass, similarly to an increase in main-sequence mass,
and thus complicate the inference ofprogenitor masses. In contrast to the great
sensitivity on progenitor radius, SN II-P color evolution appears insensitive
to variations in explosion energy. Finally, we document the numerous SN II-P
signatures that vary with progenitor metallicity, revealing their potential for
metallicity determinations in the nearby and distant Universe.

semi-classical approach is adopted, where the graviton one-loop contribution to
a classical energy in a background spacetime is computed through a variational
approach with Gaussian trial wave functionals. The energy density of the
graviton one-loop contribution, in this context, acts as a source for the
electric/magnetic charge. The ultraviolet (UV) divergences, which arise
analyzing this procedure, are kept under control with the help of an
appropriate choice of the Rainbow's functions. In this way we avoid the
introduction of any regularization/renormalization scheme. A comparison with
the observed data lead us to determine the size of the electron and of the
magnetic monopole which appear to be of Planckian size. Both results seem to be
of the same order for a Schwarzschild and a de Sitter background, respectively.
Estimates on the magnetic monopole size have been done with the help of the
Dirac quantization procedure. We find that the monopole radius is larger than
the electron radius. Even in this case the ratio between the electric and
magnetic monopole radius appears to be of the same order for both geometries.

the radiation dominated phase produce a characteristic spectrum of
gravitational waves. We calculate the complete gravitational wave spectrum due
to inflation, preheating and cosmic strings, which turns out to have several

we fill this gap by addressing probabilistic nearest neighbor queries in

specifically the Markov chain model. We study three nearest neighbor query
semantics that take as input a query state or trajectory $q$ and a time

evaluation algorithms, while for the general case, we propose a sophisticated

sampling approach can be used in Monte-Carlo based approximation solutions. We
include an extensive experimental study to support our theoretical results.

action of gravitational torques in the massive disk during its early formation.
We develop a simplified one-dimensional accretion disk model that takes into
account the infall of gas from the envelope onto the disk and the transfer of
angular momentum in the disk with an effective viscosity. First we evaluate the
gas accretion rate from the cloud core onto the disk by approximately
estimating the effects of gas pressure and gravity acting on the cloud core. We
formulate the effective viscosity as a function of the Toomre Q parameter that
measures the local gravitational stability of the rotating thin disk. We use a
function for viscosity that changes sensitively with Q when the disk is
gravitationally unstable. We find a strong self-regulation mechanism in the
disk evolution. During the formation stage of protoplanetary disks, the
evolution of the surface density does not depend on the other details of the
modeling of effective viscosity, such as the prefactor of the viscosity
coefficient. Next, to verify our model, we compare the time evolution of the
disk calculated with our formulation with that of three-dimensional
hydrodynamical simulations. The structures of the resultant disks from the
one-dimensional accretion disk model agree well with those of the
three-dimensional simulations. Our model is a useful tool for the further
modeling of chemistry, radiative transfer, and planet formation in
protoplanetary disks.

Among the stellar complexes identified by young clusters, the most metal-poor

the OpenFOAM library for Computational Continuum Mechanics (CCM) using the C++
programming language with modern policy based design for high program code
modularity. The development of the geometrical VoF algorithm significantly
extends the method base of the OpenFOAM library by geometrical volumetric flux

  For the volume fraction advection, a novel unsplit geometrical algorithm is
developed, which inherently sustains volume conservation utilizing unique
Lagrangian discrete trajectories located in the mesh points. This practice
completely eliminates the possibility of an overlap between the flux polyhedra
and hence significantly increases volume conservation. A new efficient
(quadratic convergent) and accurate iterative flux correction algorithm is
developed, which avoids topological changes of the flux polyhedra. Our
geometrical VoF algorithm is dimension agnostic, providing automatic support
for both 2D and 3D computations, following the established practice in
OpenFOAM. The geometrical algorithm used for the volume fraction transport has
been extended to support dynamic local AMR available in OpenFOAM. Furthermore,
the existing dynamic mesh capability of OpenFOAM has been modified to support
the geometrical mapping algorithm executed as a part of the dynamic local AMR
cycle. The method implementation is fully parallelized using the domain
decomposition approach.

theoretical problem. An extremely high mutation rate allows the virus to
escape, at each epidemic season, the host immune protection elicited by
previous infections. At the same time, at each given epidemic season a single
quasi-species, that is a set of closely related strains, is observed. A
non-trivial relation between the genetic (i.e., at the sequence level) and the
antigenic (i.e., related to the host immune response) distances can shed light
into this puzzle. In this paper we introduce a model in which, in accordance
with experimental observations, a simple interaction rule based on spatial
correlations among point mutations dynamically defines an immunity space in the
space of sequences. We investigate the static and dynamic structure of this
space and we discuss how it affects the dynamics of the virus-host interaction.

astrophysics, but there still exist large gaps in our understanding of their
properties and formation because they are rare and therefore distant. It has
been found that most O-stars are multiples. HD 150 136 is the nearest system to
Earth with >100 M_sol, and provides a unique opportunity to study an extremely
massive system. Recently, evidence for the existence of a third component in HD
150 136, in addition to the tight spectroscopic binary that forms the main
component, was found in spectroscopic observations. Our aim was to image and
obtain astrometric and photometric measurements of this component using long
baseline optical interferometry to further constrain the nature of this
component. We observed HD150136 with the near-infrared instrument AMBER
attached to the ESO VLT Interferometer. The recovered closure phases are robust
to systematic errors and provide unique information on the source asymmetry.
Therefore, they are of crucial relevance for both image reconstruction and
model fitting of the source structure. The third component in HD 150 136 is
clearly detected in the high-quality data from AMBER. It is located at a
projected angular distance of 7.3 mas, or about 13 AU at the line-of-sight
distance of HD 150 136, at a position angle of 209 degrees East of North, and
has a flux ratio of 0.25 with respect to the inner binary. We resolved the
third component of HD 150 136 in J, H and K filters. The luminosity and color
of the tertiary agrees with the predictions and shows that it is also an O
main-sequence star. The small measured angular separation indicates that the
tertiary may be approaching the periastron of its orbit. These results, only
achievable with long baseline near infrared interferometry, constitute the
first step towards the understanding of the massive star formation mechanisms.

increasing rate of ~17 ms per year and therefore to confirm the signal as the
spin period of an accreting, spinning-down neutron star. The pulse profile of
1RXS J2253 (~50-60% pulsed fraction) is complex and energy independent (within
the statistical uncertainties). The 1-10 keV Chandra spectra are well fit by an
absorbed power-law model with photon index ~1.4 and observed flux of (2-5)e-12
erg cm^-2 s^-1. The source was also detected by INTEGRAL in the 17-60 keV band

around 15 keV. We also carried out optical spectroscopic follow-up observations

to first classify the companion of 1RXS J2253 as a B0-1III-Ve (most likely a

Hydrodynamical simulations show that convective motions lead to significant
differences in the atmospheric structures of red giants with respect to those
predicted by the classical 1D model atmospheres. Results of these simulations
also show that in certain cases 1D models fail to reproduce even the average
properties of the 3D hydrodynamical models, such as P-T profiles. Large
horizontal temperature fluctuations in the 3D model atmospheres, as well as
differences between the temperature profiles of the average <3D> and 1D models,
lead to large discrepancies in the strengths of spectral lines predicted by the
3D and 1D model atmospheres. This is especially important in models at lowest
metallicities ([M/H]<-2.0) where the 3D-1D abundance differences may reach (or
even exceed) -0.6 dex for lines of neutral atoms and molecules. We also discuss
several simplifications and numerical aspects involved in the present 3D

that the question whether such a theory can be treated as a kind of
""generalization"" of the quantum theory of the two-qubit system cannot be
answered positively. Some of its features put it closer to the quantum world,
for example measurements must be destructive, on the other hand the Heisenberg
uncertainty relations are not satisfied. Another interesting property
contrasting it from quantum mechanics is that the subset of ""classically
correlated states,"" i.e.\ the states with only classical correlations, does not
reproduce the classical world of two two-state systems. Our results establish a
new link between quantum information theory and the well-developed theory of
quantum logics and can shed new light on the problem why quantum mechanics is
distinguished among non-signaling theories.

Obvious applications range from infrastructural to technological networks. By

300$^\circ$C to 600$^\circ$C, the film goes from a disordered nanocrystalline
phase to $B2$ ordered and finally to the $L2_1$ ordered alloy. The saturation
magnetic moment improves with structural ordering and approaches the
Slater-Pauling value of $\approx 5.0 \mu_B$ per formula unit for $T_A$ =
600$^\circ$C. At this stage the films are soft magnets with coercive and
saturation fields as low as $\approx$ 7 mT and 350 mT, respectively. Remarkable
effects of improved structural order are also seen in longitudinal resistivity
($\rho_{xx}$) and residual resistivity ratio. A model based upon electronic
transparency of grain boundaries illucidates the transition from a state of
negative $d\rho/dT$ to positive $d\rho/dT$ with improved structural order. The
Hall resistivity ($\rho_{xy}$) derives contribution from the normal scattering
of charge carriers in external magnetic field, the anomalous effect originating
from built-in magnetization and a small but distinct topological Hall effect in
the disordered phase. The carrier concentration ($n$) and mobility ($\mu$) have
been extracted from the high field $\rho_{xy}$ data. The highly ordered films
are characterized by $n$ and $\mu$ of 1.19$\times$ 10$^{29}$ m$^{-3}$ and 0.4

$\rho_{xx}$ indicates the dominance of skew scattering in our films, which
shows a monotonic drop on raising the $T_A$. The topological Hall effect is

IRAM30m telescope to map 14 massive star-forming regions in the SiO(2-1),
SiO(5-4) and HCO+(1-0) outflow lines, and in several dense gas and hot core
tracers. Hi-GAL data was used to improve the spectral energy distributions and
the L/M ratio, which is believed to be a good indicator of the evolutionary
stage of the YSO. We detect SiO and HCO+ outflow emission in all the sources,
and bipolar structures in six of them. The outflow parameters are similar to
those found toward other massive YSOs. We find an increase of the HCO+ outflow
energetics as the object evolve, and a decrease of the SiO abundance with time,
from 10^(-8) to 10^(-9). The SiO(5-4) to (2-1) line ratio is found to be low at
the ambient gas velocity, and increases as we move to high velocities,
indicating that the excitation conditions of the SiO change with the velocity
of the gas (with larger densities and/or temperatures for the high-velocity gas
component). The properties of the SiO and HCO+ outflow emission suggest a
scenario in which SiO is largely enhanced in the first evolutionary stages,
probably due to strong shocks produced by the protostellar jet. As the object
evolves, the power of the jet would decrease and so does the SiO abundance.
During this process, however, the material surrounding the protostar would have
been been swept up by the jet, and the outflow activity, traced by entrained
molecular material (HCO+), would increase with time.

standard experimental setup a beam of parallel light with a 'short' wavelength
$\lambda \ll 2 \pi/q$ passes the nematic layer. Recording the transmitted light
the patterns are either directly visualized by shadowgraphy or characterized
more indirectly by the diffraction fringes due to the optical grating effects
of the pattern. In this work we present a systematic short-wavelength analysis
of these methods for the commonly used planar orientation of the optical axis
of liquid crystal at the confining surfaces. Our approach covers general 3D
experimental geometries with respect to the relative orientation of $\bm q$ and
of the wavevector $\bm k$ of the incident light. In particular the importance
of phase grating effects is emphasized, which are not accessible in a pure
geometric optics approach. Finally, as a byproduct we present also an optical
analysis of convection rolls in Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, where the
refraction index of the fluid is isotropic in contrast to its uniaxial symmetry
in nematic liquid crystals. Our analysis is in excellent agreement with an
earlier physical optics approach by Trainoff and Cannell [Physics of Fluids

modelling the black hole by its set of quasinormal modes. The horizon then
becomes a extended region: the quantum ergosphere. The interaction of the
quantum ergosphere and the quantum field provides a natural regularization
mechanism. The width of the quantum ergosphere provides the right cut-off for

previous approaches involving polar interpolation for compressive parameter
estimation in two aspects: (i) we extend the formulation from real non-negative
amplitude parameters to arbitrary complex ones, and (ii) we allow for mismatch
between the manifold described by the parameters and its polar approximation.
To quantify the improvements afforded by the proposed extensions, we evaluate
six algorithms for estimation of parameters in sparse translation-invariant
signals, exemplified with the time delay estimation problem. The evaluation is
based on three performance metrics: estimator precision, sampling rate and
computational complexity. We use compressive sensing with all the algorithms to
lower the necessary sampling rate and show that it is still possible to attain
good estimation precision and keep the computational complexity low. Our
numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithms outperform existing
approaches that either leverage polynomial interpolation or are based on a
conversion to a frequency-estimation problem followed by a super-resolution
algorithm. The algorithms studied here provide various tradeoffs between
computational complexity, estimation precision, and necessary sampling rate.
The work shows that compressive sensing for the class of sparse
translation-invariant signals allows for a decrease in sampling rate and that
the use of polar interpolation increases the estimation precision.

a persistent, non-uniform density modulation in force space, which emerges at

to various parameters such as $R_0$ (the basic reproduction number), $N$, $n$
are investigated on simulations. Two models, $SIR$ and $SIRS$, corresponding to
single and recurrent outbreaks, respectively, are used to simulate data. The
findings indicate that our estimators have good asymptotic properties and
behave noticeably well for realistic numbers of observations and population
sizes. This study lays the foundations of a generic inference method currently
under extension to incompletely observed epidemic data. Indeed, contrary to the
majority of current inference techniques for partially observed processes,
which necessitates computer intensive simulations, our method being mostly an
analytical approach requires only the classical optimization steps.

  Codes",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Distributed storage systems employ codes to provide resilience to failure of
multiple storage disks. Specifically, an $(n, k)$ MDS code stores $k$ symbols
in $n$ disks such that the overall system is tolerant to a failure of up to
$n-k$ disks. However, access to at least $k$ disks is still required to repair
a single erasure. To reduce repair bandwidth, array codes are used where the
stored symbols or packets are vectors of length $\ell$. MDS array codes have
the potential to repair a single erasure using a fraction $1/(n-k)$ of data
stored in the remaining disks. We introduce new methods of analysis which
capitalize on the translation of the storage system problem into a geometric
problem on a set of operators and subspaces. In particular, we ask the
following question: for a given $(n, k)$, what is the minimum vector-length or
sub-packetization factor $\ell$ required to achieve this optimal fraction? For
\emph{exact recovery} of systematic disks in an MDS code of low redundancy,
i.e. $k/n > 1/2$, the best known explicit codes \cite{WTB12} have a
sub-packetization factor $\ell$ which is exponential in $k$. It has been
conjectured \cite{TWB12} that for a fixed number of parity nodes, it is in fact
necessary for $\ell$ to be exponential in $k$. In this paper, we provide a new
log-squared converse bound on $k$ for a given $\ell$, and prove that $k \le
2\log_2\ell\left(\log_{\delta}\ell+1\right)$, for an arbitrary number of parity
nodes $r = n-k$, where $\delta = r/(r-1)$.

bounded (baryonic) mass, M, is phi(r)=(MGa0)^{1/2}ln(r); a0 is the MOND
constant. Relativistic MOND theories predict that the lensing effects of M are
dictated by phi(r) as general-relativity lensing is dictated by the Newtonian
potential. Thus, MOND predicts that the asymptotic Newtonian potential deduced
from galaxy-galaxy gravitational lensing will have: (1) a logarithmic r
dependence, and (2) a normalization (parametrized standardly as 2s^2) that
depends only on M: s=(MGa0/4)^{1/4}. I compare these predictions with recent
results of galaxy-galaxy lensing, and find agreement on all counts. For the
""blue""-lenses subsample (""spiral"" galaxies) MOND reproduces the observations
well with an r'-band M/L of 1-3 solar units, and for ""red"" lenses (""elliptical""
galaxies) with M/L of 3-6 solar units, both consistent with baryons only. In
contradistinction, Newtonian analysis requires, typically, M/L values of about
130 solar units, bespeaking a mass discrepancy of a factor of about 40.
Compared with the staple, rotation-curve tests, MOND is here tested in a wider
population of galaxies, through a different phenomenon, using relativistic test
objects, and is probed to several-times-lower accelerations--as low as a few
percent of a0.

framework for this forward calculation, beginning with an efficient numerical
method for solving the Fokker-Planck equation in the presence of an electric
field of arbitrary strength. The approach is continuum (Eulerian), and we
employ a relativistic collision operator, valid for arbitrary energies. Both
primary and secondary runaway electron generation are included. For cases in
which primary generation dominates, a time-independent formulation of the
problem is described, requiring only the solution of a single sparse linear
system. In the limit of dominant secondary generation, we present the first
numerical verification of an analytic model for the distribution function. The
numerical electron distribution function in the presence of both primary and
secondary generation is then used for calculating the synchrotron emission
spectrum of the runaways. It is found that the average synchrotron spectra
emitted from realistic distribution functions are not well approximated by the
emission of a single electron at the maximum energy.

onto a space $Y_N$ spanned by the reduced basis functions which are constructed

parameter dependence, we use the offline-online computational procedures
developed earlier to split the computational procedure into offline and online
stages. We verify the proposed computational procedure by applying it to a
three-dimensional simulation dental implant problem. The good numerical results
show that our proposed procedure performs better than the standard POD--Greedy

dust budget of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) are studied with evolutionary
dust models with the main goals (1) to investigate how the amount and
composition of dust from AGB stars vary over galactic history; (2) to
characterise the mass and metallicity distribution of the present population of
AGB stars; (3) to quantify the contribution of AGB stars of different mass and
metallicity to the present stardust population in the interstellar medium
(ISM). We use models of the stardust lifecycle in the ISM developed and tested
for the Solar neighbourhood. The first global spatially resolved reconstruction
of the star formation history of the LMC from the Magellanic Clouds Photometric
Survey is employed to calculate the stellar populations in the LMC. The dust
input from AGB stars is dominated by carbon grains from stars with masses < 4
Msun almost over the entire history of the LMC. The production of silicate,
silicon carbide and iron dust is delayed until the ISM is enriched to about
half the present metallicity in the LMC. For the first time, theoretically
calculated dust production rates of AGB stars are compared to those derived
from IR observations of AGB stars for the entire galaxy. We find good agreement
within scatter of various observational estimates. We show that the majority of
silicate and iron grains in the present stardust population originate from a
small population of intermediate-mass stars consisting of only about 4% of the
total number of stars, whereas in the Solar neighbourhood they originate from
low-mass stars. With models of the lifecycle of stardust grains in the ISM we
confirm a large discrepancy between dust input from stars and the existing
interstellar dust mass in the LMC reported in Matsuura et al. 2009.

from the standard model prediction can be completely explained by mixing of the
muon with extra vectorlike leptons, L and E, near the electroweak scale. This
mixing simultaneously contributes to the muon mass. We show that the
correlation between contributions to the muon mass and muon g-2 is controlled
by the mass of the neutrino originating from the doublet L. Positive
correlation, simultaneously explaining both measured values, requires this mass
below 200 GeV. The decay rate of the Higgs boson to muon pairs is modified and,
in the region of the parameter space that can explain the muon anomalous
magnetic moment within one standard deviation, it ranges from 0.5 to 24 times
the standard model prediction. In the same scenario, $h \to \gamma \gamma$ can
be enhanced or lowered by ~50% from the standard model prediction. The
explanation of the muon g-2 anomaly and predictions for $h \to \gamma \gamma$
are not correlated since these are controlled by independent parameters. This
scenario can be embedded in a model with three complete vectorlike families
featuring gauge coupling unification, sufficiently stable proton, and the Higgs
quartic coupling remaining positive all the way to the grand unification scale.

that as it may, the process used, is described in the paper, Windtalking

cryptanalysis efforts of that method and; a real world application of that
method as an answer to the increasing problem of password file hacking. The
premise is that the technique is a variant of one time pad, using a novel way
to produce one time pad output for digital input. There is no record in the
literature of such a method being used for encryption at all. Digital
encryption generally treats the letters of the plaintext as a binary number and
does some mathematical computation to produce ciphertext. The idea of inserting
bits with a random generated key is new. Therefore (because a uniquely random
generated key is used), the encryption is cryptanalytically unbreakable and/or
computationally secure and/or information theoretic. An academic version was
made. Challenges for decryption have not produced to-date a decryption.
Advantages and disadvantages of the method are discussed.
  Hackers are constantly penetrating networks and stealing password files.
Which, once in possession of a password file, hackers individually or
collectively with distributed processing over the Internet, decrypt the values
of the hash passwords. Thereby gaining access to systems. This problem has
become sufficiently significant for CAESAR (Competition for Authenticated
Encryption: Security, Applicability, and Robustness) to make calls for papers
for solutions. Herein is one proposed solution. While one time pad presents a
problem being computationally intensive, for the relatively short length of
passwords, the cost of computation may be cost effective for the security
provided.

where the automorphic function takes a value only once, and a linear-fractional
transformation tessellates the plane in replicas of the fundamental region. The
condition that the homologues of the poles, representing vertices, be angles
places restrictions on quantum numbers which are no longer integers, for,
otherwise, the phase factors would become unity. Restriction must be made to
regular singular points for only then will solutions to the differential
equation be rational functions so that the covering group will be cyclic and
the covering space be a ""spiral staircase"". Many of the equations of
mathematical physics, with essential singularities, become Fuchsian
differential equations, with regular singularities, at zero kinetic energy.
Examples of geometric phase include the phasor, the Pancharatnam phase of beams
of polarized light in different states, the Aharanov-Bohm phase, and angular
momentum with centripetal ""attraction"". In the latter example, the phase is
one-half the area of the lune, which disappears when the pole at infinity

The behavior of an automorphic function at a limit point on the boundary is
analogous to the confluence of two regular singularities in a linear

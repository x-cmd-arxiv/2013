first appearance. CS exploits the signal's sparsity or compressibility in a
particular domain and integrates data compression and acquisition, thus
allowing exact reconstruction through relatively few non-adaptive linear
measurements. While conventional CS theory relies on data representation in the
form of vectors, many data types in various applications such as color imaging,
video sequences, and multi-sensor networks, are intrinsically represented by
higher-order tensors. Application of CS to higher-order data representation is
typically performed by conversion of the data to very long vectors that must be
measured using very large sampling matrices, thus imposing a huge computational
and memory burden. In this paper, we propose Generalized Tensor Compressive
Sensing (GTCS)--a unified framework for compressive sensing of higher-order
tensors which preserves the intrinsic structure of tensor data with reduced
computational complexity at reconstruction. GTCS offers an efficient means for
representation of multidimensional data by providing simultaneous acquisition
and compression from all tensor modes. In addition, we propound two
reconstruction procedures, a serial method (GTCS-S) and a parallelizable method
(GTCS-P). We then compare the performance of the proposed method with Kronecker
compressive sensing (KCS) and multi way compressive sensing (MWCS). We
demonstrate experimentally that GTCS outperforms KCS and MWCS in terms of both
reconstruction accuracy (within a range of compression ratios) and processing
speed. The major disadvantage of our methods (and of MWCS as well), is that the
compression ratios may be worse than that offered by KCS.

decades of research. Here, we propose a mathematical model of cellular aging
based on a model gene interaction network. Our network model is made of only
non-aging components - the biological functions of gene interactions decrease
with a constant mortality rate. Death of a cell occurs in the model when an
essential gene loses all of its interactions to other genes, equivalent to the
deletion of an essential gene. Gene interactions are stochastic based on a
binomial distribution. We show that the defining characteristic of biological
aging, the exponential increase of mortality rate over time, can arise from
this gene network model during the early stage of aging. Hence, we demonstrate
that cellular aging is an emergent property of this model network. Our model
predicts that the rate of aging, defined by the Gompertz coefficient, is
approximately proportional to the average number of active interactions per
gene and that the stochastic heterogeneity of gene interactions is an important
factor in the dynamics of the aging process. This theoretic framework offers a
mechanistic foundation for the pleiotropic nature of aging and can provide
insights on cellular aging.

the nearby (9.8 Mpc) irregular galaxy NGC 3239. The photometric evolution is
that of a normal type IIP supernova. The absolute maximum magnitude, with MB =
-16.23 +- 0.16 mag. SN2012A reached a peak luminosity of about 2X10**42 erg/s,
which is brighter than those of other SNe with a similar 56Ni mass. The latter
was estimated from the luminosity in the exponential tail of the light curve
and found to be M(56Ni) = 0.011 +-0.004 Msun. The spectral evolution of SN
2012A is also typical of SN IIP, from the early spectra dominated by a blue
continuum and very broad (~10**4 km/s) Balmer lines, to the late-photospheric
spectra characterized by prominent P-Cygni features of metal lines (Fe II, Sc
II, Ba II, Ti II, Ca II, Na ID). The photospheric velocity is moderately low,
~3X10**3 km/s at 50 days, for the low optical depth metal lines. The nebular
spectrum obtained 394 days after the shock breakout shows the typical features
of SNe IIP and the strength of the [O I] doublet suggests a progenitor of
intermediate mass, similar to SN 2004et (~15 Msun). A candidate progenitor for
SN 2012A has been identified in deep, pre-explosion K'-band Gemini North (NIRI)
images, and found to be consistent with a star with a bolometric magnitude
-7.08+-0.36 (log L/Lsun = 4.73 +- 0.14$ dex). The magnitude of the recovered
progenitor in archival images points toward a moderate-mass 10.5 (-2/+4.5) Msun
star as the precursor of SN 2012A. The explosion parameters and progenitor mass
were also estimated by means of a hydrodynamical model, fitting the bolometric
light curve, the velocity and the temperature evolution. We found a best fit
for a kinetic energy of 0.48 foe, an initial radius of 1.8X10**13 cm and ejecta
mass of 12.5 Msun.

into galaxy formation and evolution. We build analytic models for the
distribution of galaxy shapes based on halo properties extracted from the
Millennium Simulation, differentiating between early- and late-type galaxies as
well as central galaxies and satellites. The resulting ellipticity correlations
are investigated for their physical properties and compared to a suite of
current observations. The best-faring model is then used to predict the
intrinsic alignment contamination of planned weak lensing surveys. We find that
late-type galaxy models generally have weak intrinsic ellipticity correlations,
marginally increasing towards smaller galaxy separation and higher redshift.
The signal for early-type models at fixed halo mass strongly increases by three
orders of magnitude over two decades in galaxy separation, and by one order of
magnitude from z=0 to z=2. The intrinsic alignment strength also depends
strongly on halo mass, but not on galaxy luminosity at fixed mass, or galaxy
number density in the environment. We identify models that are in good
agreement with all observational data, except that all models over-predict
alignments of faint early-type galaxies. The best model yields an intrinsic
alignment contamination of a Euclid-like survey between 0.5-10% at z>0.6 and on
angular scales larger than a few arcminutes. Cutting 20% of red foreground
galaxies using observer-frame colours can suppress this contamination by up to

first, the gas flow is well described by the Navier-Stokes equations, while in

Maxwell-Boltzmann energy distribution of the neutral particles is the natural
outcome, the results of the gas flow differ significantly. The fluid model

continuum. This is due to exclusion of non-local effects in the multi

factor. Contrary to what is done in the Cox model, the baseline risk is one

estimate. As in Extreme Value Theory, all the high level events will be used to
make estimation and the results will be extrapolated to the extreme level ones.
After a precise description of the model, we present the estimation results and
a model extension. A prediction for the current solar cycle (24th) is also
proposed.

While the generalized gradient approximation fails to describe the electronic
structure of the N impurity in ZnO correctly, methods that widen the band gap
of ZnO by introducing additional non-local potentials yield the formation
energy and charge transfer level of the impurity in reasonable agreement with
hybrid functional calculations. Summarizing the results obtained with different
methods, we corroborate earlier findings that the formation of substitutional N
impurities at the oxygen site in ZnO from N atoms is most likely slightly
endothermic under oxygen-rich preparation conditions, and introduces a deep
level more than 1eV above the valence band edge of ZnO. Moreover, the
comparison of methods elucidates subtle differences in the predicted electronic
structure, e.g. concerning the orientation of unoccupied orbitals in the
crystal field and the stability of the charged triplet state of the N impurity.
Further experimental or theoretical analysis of these features could provide
useful tests for validating the performance of DFT methods in their application

(DLs) ALC, ALCI, ALCQ, as well as ALCO, ALCQO, ALCQIO and EL.
  TBoxes of ALC, ALCI and ALCQ are characterised as fragments of FO which are
invariant under global bisimulation and disjoint unions. The logics ALCO, ALCQO
and ALCQIO, which incorporate individuals, are characterised w.r.t. to the
class K of all interpretations which interpret individuals as singleton sets.
The characterisations for TBoxes of ALCO and ALCQO both require additionally
that an FO-sentence is, under certain circumstances, preserved under forward
generated subinterpretations. FO-sentences equivalent to ALCQIO-TBoxes, are -
due to ALCQIO's inverse roles - characterised similarly but are required to be
preserved under generated subinterpretations.
  EL as sub-boolean DL is characterised on concept level as the FO-fragment
which is preserved under simulation and preserved under direct products.
Equally valid is the characterisation by being preserved under simulation and
having minimal models. For EL-TBoxes, a global version of simulation was not
sufficient but FO-sentences of EL-TBoxes are invariant under global
equi-simulation, disjoint unions and direct products.
  For each of these description logics, the characteristic concepts are
explicated and the characterisation is accompanied by an investigation under
which notion of saturation the logic in hand enjoys the
Hennessy-and-Milner-Property.
  As application of the results we determine the minimal globally bisimilar
companion w.r.t. ALCQO-bisimulation and introduce the L1-to-L2-rewritability

shifts, normalized annihilation rates $Z_{\rm eff}$ and annihilation gamma
spectra for positron collisions with the hydrogen-like ions He$^+$, Li$^{2+}$,
B$^{4+}$ and F$^{8+}$. Short-range electron-positron correlations and
longer-range positron-ion correlations are accounted for by evaluating nonlocal
corrections to the annihilation vertex and the exact positron self-energy. The
numerical calculation of the many-body theory diagrams is performed using
B-spline basis sets. To elucidate the r\^ole of the positron-ion repulsion, the
annihilation rate is also estimated analytically in the Coulomb-Born
approximation. It is found that the energy dependence and magnitude of $Z_{\rm
eff}$ is governed by the Gamow factor that characterizes the suppression of the
positron wave function near the ion. For all of the H-like ions, the
correlation enhancement of the annihilation rate is found to be predominantly
due to corrections to the annihilation vertex, while the corrections to the
positron wave function play only a minor r\^ole. Results of the calculations
for $s$, $p$ and d-wave incident positrons of energies up to the positronium
formation threshold are presented. Where comparison is possible, our values are
in excellent agreement with the results obtained using other, e.g.,
variational, methods. The annihilation vertex enhancement factors obtained in
the present calculations are found to scale approximately as
$1+(1.6+0.46\ell)/Z_i$, where $Z_i$ is the net charge of the ion and $\ell$ is
the positron orbital angular momentum. Our results for positron annihilation in
H-like ions provide insights into the problem of positron annihilation with

coupled to the reservoirs. The first one corresponds to filling $\nu=1$ and
tunneling coupling to the reservoirs. The second one corresponds to integer or
fractional filling of the sequence $\nu=1/m$ (with $m$ odd), and capacitive
coupling to the reservoirs. In both cases we solve the problem by means of
non-equilibrium Green function formalism. We show that heat propagates chirally
along the edge in the two setups. We identify two temperature regimes, defined
by $\Delta$, the mean level spacing of the edge. At low temperatures, $T<
\Delta$, finite size effects play an important role in heat transport, for both
types of contacts. The nature of the contacts manifest themselves in different
power laws for the thermal conductance as a function of the temperature. For
capacitive couplings a highly non-universal behavior takes place, through a
prefactor that depends on the length of the edge as well as on the coupling
strengths and the filling fraction. For larger temperatures, $T>\Delta$,
finite-size effects become irrelevant, but the heat transport strongly depends
on the strength of the edge-reservoir interactions, in both cases. The thermal
conductance for tunneling coupling grows linearly with $T$, whereas for the
capacitive case it saturates to a value that depends on the coupling strengths
and the filling factors of the edge and the contacts.

while some of the non-standard models provide a better fit to the solar

rest-frame FIR emission from typical SF systems (LBGs) at redshift 3, 4, and 5.
We initially concentrate on LBGs at z~3 and select three subsamples on stellar
mass, extinction corrected SF and rest-frame UV-magnitude. We produce composite
870micron images of the typical source in our subsamples, obtaining ~4sigma
detections and suggesting a correlation between FIR luminosity and stellar
mass. We apply a similar procedure to our full samples at z~3, 4, 4.5 and 5 and
do not obtain detections - consistent with a simple scaling between FIR
luminosity and stellar mass. In order to constrain the FIR SED of these systems
we explore their emission at multiple wavelengths spanning the peak of dust
emission at z~3 using the Herschel SPIRE observations of the field. We obtain
detections at multiple wavelengths for both our stellar mass and UV-magnitude
selected samples, and find a best-fit SED with T_dust in the ~33-41K range. We
calculate L_FIR, obscured SFRs and M_dust, and find that a significant fraction
of SF in these systems is obscured. Interestingly, our extinction corrected SFR
sample does not display the large FIR fluxes predicted from its red UV-spectral
slope. This suggests that the method of assuming an intrinsic UV-slope and
correcting for dust attenuation may be invalid for this sample - and that these
are not in fact the most actively SF systems. All of our z~3 samples fall on
the `main sequence' of SF galaxies at z~3 and our detected subsamples are
likely to represent the high obscuration end of LBGs at their epoch. We compare
the FIR properties of our subsamples with various other populations, finding
that our stellar mass selected sample shows similar FIR characteristics to SMGs

rod-shaped Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis cells, we demonstrate that
the cells can exhibit two fundamentally different modes of deformation. The
cells behave like elastic rods when subjected to transient forces, but deform
plastically when significant cell wall synthesis occurs while the force is
applied. The deformed cells always recover their shape. The experimental
results are in quantitative agreement with the predictions of the theory of
dislocation-mediated growth. In particular, we find that a single dimensionless

properties of the cell, can describe the cell's responses under various
experimental conditions. These findings provide insight into how living cells
robustly maintain their shape under varying physical environments.

8$\deg$ to 45$\deg$, for an Sb galaxy, and from 10$\deg$ to 60$\deg$, for an Sc

Based on ordered behavior, periodic orbits studies show that for pitch angles
up to approximately $15\deg$, $18\deg$, and $20\deg$ for Sa, Sb and Sc
galaxies, respectively, the density response supports the spiral arms
potential, a requisite for the existence of a long-lasting large-scale spiral

potential imposed by mantaining lower pitch angles in the density response; in
that case the spiral arms may be explained as transient features rather than
long-lasting large-scale structures. In a second limit, from a phase space

reversal (T) symmetry are characterized by gapless Majorana cones on their
surface. Free fermion phases with this symmetry (class DIII) are indexed by an
integer n, of which n=1 is realized by the B-phase of superfluid Helium-3.
Previously it was believed that the surface must be gapless unless time
reversal symmetry is broken. Here we argue that a fully symmetric and gapped
surface is possible in the presence of strong interactions, if a special type
of topological order appears on the surface. The topological order realizes T
symmetry in an anomalous way, one that is impossible to achieve in purely two
dimensions. For odd n TScs, the surface topological order must be non-Abelian.
We propose the simplest non-Abelian topological order that contains electron
like excitations, SO(3)_6, with four quasiparticles, as a candidate surface
state. Remarkably, this theory has a hidden T invariance which however is
broken in any 2D realization. By explicitly constructing an exactly soluble
Walker-Wang model we show that it can be realized at the surface of a short
ranged entangled 3D fermionic phase protected by T symmetry, with bulk
electrons trasforming as Kramers pairs, i.e. T^2=-1 under time reversal. We
also propose an Abelian theory, the semion-fermion topological order, to
realize an even n TSc surface, for which an explicit model is derived using a
coupled layer construction. We argue that this is related to the n=2 TSc, and
use this to build candidate surface topological orders for n=4 and n=8 TScs.
The latter is equivalent to the three fermion state which is the surface
topological order of a Z2 bosonic topological phase protected by T invariance.
One particular consequence of this is that an n=16 TSc admits a trivially
gapped T-symmetric surface.

perspective to be distributed to some extent non-locally because of
correlations extant among the system's components. This non-locality allows
users to transfer, in effect, locally accessible energy between sites of
different system components by LOCC (local operations and classical
communication). Quantum energy teleportation is a three-step LOCC protocol,
accomplished without an external energy carrier, for effectively transferring
energy between two physically separated, but correlated, sites. We apply this
LOCC teleportation protocol to a model Heisenberg spin particle pair initially
in a quantum thermal Gibbs state, making temperature an explicit parameter. We
find in this setting that energy teleportation is possible at any temperature,
even at temperatures above the threshold where the particles' entanglement
vanishes. This shows for Gibbs spin states that entanglement is not
fundamentally necessary for energy teleportation; correlation other than
entanglement can suffice. Dissonance---quantum correlation in separable
states---is in this regard shown to be a quantum resource for energy
teleportation, more dissonance being consistently associated with greater
energy yield. We compare energy teleportation from particle A to B in Gibbs
states with direct local energy extraction by a general quantum operation on B
and find a temperature threshold below which energy extraction by a local
operation is impossible. This threshold delineates essentially two regimes: a
high temperature regime where entanglement vanishes and the teleportation
generated by other quantum correlations yields only vanishingly little energy
relative to local extraction and a second low-temperature teleportation regime
where energy is available at B only by teleportation.

environment. Principles of biological terrestrial locomotion have been
discovered on unconfined vertical and horizontal substrates. However a
diversity of organisms construct, inhabit, and move within confined spaces.
Such animals are faced with locomotor challenges including limited limb range
of motion, crowding, and visual sensory deprivation. Little is known about how
these organisms accomplish their locomotor tasks, and such environments
challenge human-made devices. To gain greater insight into how animals move
within confined spaces we study the confined locomotion of the fire ant {\em
Solenopsis invicta}, which constructs subterranean tunnel networks (nests).
Laboratory experiments reveal that ants construct tunnels with diameter, D,
comparable to bodylength, L=3.5 $\pm$ 0.5 mm. Ants can move rapidly (> 9
bodylengths/sec) within these environments; their tunnels allow for effective
limb, body, and antennae interaction with walls which facilitate rapid
slip-recovery during ascending and descending climbs. To examine the limits of
slip-recovery in artificial tunnels we perform perturbations consisting of
rapid downward accelerations of the tunnels, which induce falls. Below a
critical tunnel diameter, $D_s = 1.31 \pm 0.02$ L, falls are always arrested
through rapid interaction of appendages and antennae with tunnel walls to jam
the falls. $D_s$ is comparable to the size of incipient nest tunnels (D = 1.06

thresholding of singular values, where singular values below a prescribed
threshold $\lambda$ are set to 0. We study the asymptotic MSE in a framework
where the matrix size is large compared to the rank of the matrix to be
recovered, and the signal-to-noise ratio of the low-rank piece stays constant.
The AMSE-optimal choice of hard threshold, in the case of n-by-n matrix in
noise level \sigma, is simply $(4/\sqrt{3}) \sqrt{n}\sigma \approx 2.309
\sqrt{n}\sigma$ when $\sigma$ is known, or simply $2.858\cdot y_{med}$ when
$\sigma$ is unknown, where $y_{med}$ is the median empirical singular value.
For nonsquare $m$ by $n$ matrices with $m \neq n$, these thresholding
coefficients are replaced with different provided constants. In our asymptotic
framework, this thresholding rule adapts to unknown rank and to unknown noise
level in an optimal manner: it is always better than hard thresholding at any
other value, no matter what the matrix is that we are trying to recover, and is
always better than ideal Truncated SVD (TSVD), which truncates at the true rank
of the low-rank matrix we are trying to recover. Hard thresholding at the
recommended value to recover an n-by-n matrix of rank r guarantees an AMSE at
most $3nr\sigma^2$. In comparison, the guarantee provided by TSVD is
$5nr\sigma^2$, the guarantee provided by optimally tuned singular value soft
thresholding is $6nr\sigma^2$, and the best guarantee achievable by any
shrinkage of the data singular values is $2nr\sigma^2$. Empirical evidence
shows that these AMSE properties of the $4/\sqrt{3}$ thresholding rule remain
valid even for relatively small n, and that performance improvement over TSVD
and other shrinkage rules is substantial, turning it into the practical hard

dynamic properties, such as the viscosity, the relaxation time, and the
diffusion constant, can be described under different thermodynamic conditions
in terms of a unique scaling function of the ratio rho^gamma/T, where rho is
the density, T is the temperature, and gamma is a material dependent constant.
Given the successes of the generalized entropy theory in elucidating the
influence of molecular details on the universal properties of glass-forming
polymers, this theory is extended here to investigate the thermodynamic scaling
in polymer melts. The predictions of theory are in accord with the appearance
of thermodynamic scaling for pressures not in excess of about 50 MPa. (The
failure at higher pressures arises due to inherent limitations of a lattice
model.) In line with arguments relating the magnitude of gamma to the steepness
of the repulsive part of the intermolecular potential, the abrupt, square-well
nature of the lattice model interactions lead, as expected, to much larger
values of the scaling exponent. Nevertheless, the theory is employed to study
how individual molecular parameters affect the scaling exponent in order to
extract a molecular understanding of the information content contained in the
exponent. The chain rigidity, cohesive energy, chain length, and the side group
length are all found to significantly affect the magnitude of the scaling
exponent, and the computed trends agree well with available experiments. The
variations of gamma with these molecular parameters are explained by
establishing a correlation between the computed molecular dependence of the
scaling exponent and the fragility. Thus, the efficiency of packing the
polymers is established as the universal physical mechanism determining both
the fragility and the scaling exponent gamma.

are available, when the data are very high in dimension. Statistical
Significance of Clustering (SigClust) is a recently developed cluster
evaluation tool for high dimensional low sample size data. An important
component of the SigClust approach is the very definition of a single cluster
as a subset of data sampled from a multivariate Gaussian distribution. The
implementation of SigClust requires the estimation of the eigenvalues of the
covariance matrix for the null multivariate Gaussian distribution. We show that
the original eigenvalue estimation can lead to a test that suffers from severe
inflation of type-I error, in the important case where there are a few very
large eigenvalues. This paper addresses this critical challenge using a novel
likelihood based soft thresholding approach to estimate these eigenvalues,
which leads to a much improved SigClust. Major improvements in SigClust
performance are shown by both mathematical analysis, based on the new notion of
Theoretical Cluster Index, and extensive simulation studies. Applications to
some cancer genomic data further demonstrate the usefulness of these
improvements.

(HetNet) due to its multi-tier topological structure. We propose almost blank
resource block (ABRB) for interference control in HetNet. When an ABRB is
scheduled in a macro BS, a resource block (RB) with blank payload is
transmitted and this eliminates the interference from this macro BS to the pico
BSs. We study a two timescale hierarchical radio resource management (RRM)
scheme for HetNet with dynamic ABRB control. The long term controls, such as
dynamic ABRB, are adaptive to the large scale fading at a RRM server for
co-Tier and cross-Tier interference control. The short term control (user
scheduling) is adaptive to the local channel state information within each BS
to exploit the multi-user diversity. The two timescale optimization problem is
challenging due to the exponentially large solution space. We exploit the
sparsity in the interference graph of the HetNet topology and derive structural
properties for the optimal ABRB control. Based on that, we propose a two
timescale alternative optimization solution for the user scheduling and ABRB
control. The solution has low complexity and is asymptotically optimal at high

all thermo chemical quantities in a reacting flow by computing only the mixture
fraction Z and a progress variable C. When using such a method to predict a
turbulent combustion in conjunction with a turbulence model, a probability
density function (PDF) is required to evaluate statistical averages (e.g.,
Favre average) of chemical quantities. The choice of the PDF is a compromise
between computational costs and accuracy level. The aim of this paper is to
investigate the influence of the PDF choice and its modeling aspects in the
simulation of non premixed turbulent combustion. Three different models are
considered: the standard one, based on the choice of a beta distribution for Z
and a Dirac distribution for C; a model employing a beta distribution for both
Z and C; a third model obtained using a beta distribution for Z and the
statistical most likely distribution (SMLD) for C. The standard model, although
widely used, doesn't take into account the interaction between turbulence and
chemical kinetics as well as the dependence of the progress variable not only
on its mean but also on its variance. The SMLD approach establishes a
systematic framework to incorporate informations from an arbitrary number of
moments, thus providing an improvement over conventionally employed presumed
PDF closure models. The rational behind the choice of the three PDFs is
described in some details and the prediction capability of the corresponding
models is tested versus well known test cases, namely, the Sandia flames, and a
test case for supersonic combustion provided by Cheng.

graph C*-algebras and has two main components. Firstly, for a groupoid it is
shown that the notions of strength of convergence in the orbit space and
measure-theoretic accumulation along the orbits are equivalent ways of
realising multiplicity numbers associated to a sequence of induced
representations of the groupoid C*-algebra. Examples of directed graphs are
given, showing how to determine the multiplicity numbers associated to various
sequences of induced representations of the directed graph C*-algebras.
  The second component of this dissertation uses path groupoids to develop
various characterisations of the C*-algebras of higher-rank graphs. Necessary
and sufficient conditions are developed for the Cuntz-Krieger C*-algebras of
row-finite higher-rank graphs to be liminal and to be postliminal. When Kumjian
and Pask's path groupoid is principal, it is shown precisely when these
C*-algebras have bounded trace, are Fell, and have continuous trace. Necessary
and sufficient conditions are provided for the path groupoids of row-finite
higher-rank graphs without sources to have closed orbits and to have locally
closed orbits. When these path groupoids are principal, necessary and
sufficient conditions are provided for them to be integrable, to be Cartan and
to be proper.

under the action of the third-order dispersion (TOD) is demonstrated. The
formation of the NC structure plays an important role in the process of fission
of higher-order N-solitons in optical fibers. After the splitting of the
initial N--soliton into a nonuniform chain of fundamental quasi-solitons, the
tallest one travels along the entire chain, through consecutive collisions with
other solitons, and then escapes, while the remaining chain of pulses stays as
a bound state, due to the radiation-mediated interaction between them.
Increasing the initial soliton's order, $N$, leads to the transmission through,
and release of additional solitons with enhanced power, along with the emission
of radiation, which may demonstrate a broadband supercontinuum spectrum. The NC
dynamical regime remains robust in the presence of extra perturbations, such as
the Raman and self-steepening effects, and dispersions terms above the third
order. It is demonstrated that essentially the same NC mechanism is induced by
the TOD in finite segments of periodic wavetrains (in particular, soliton
chains). A strong difference from the mechanical NC is that the TOD-driven
pulse passing through the soliton array collects energy and momentum from other
solitons. Thus, uniform and non-uniforms arrays of nonlinear wave pulses offer
an essential extension of the mechanical NC, in which the quasi-particles,
unlike mechanical beads, interact inelastically, exchanging energy and
generating radiation. Nevertheless, the characteristic phenomenology of NC
chains may be clearly identified in these nonlinear-wave settings too.

Gamma=2.6+-0.2 at a 4 sigma statistical significance. This measurement, even if
considered to be an upper limit, strongly constrains Compton emission of the
steady radio jet, present in that state. The number of relativistic electrons
in the jet has to be low enough for the spectral components due to Compton
upscattering of the stellar blackbody and synchrotron radiation to be within
the observed fluxes. If optically-thin synchrotron emission of the jet is to
account for the MeV tail, as implied by the recently-claimed strong
polarization in that energy range, the magnetic field in the jet has to be much
above equipartition. The GeV-range measurements also strongly constrain models
of hot accretion flows, most likely present in the hard state, in which
gamma-rays are produced from decay of neutral pions produced in collisions of

functions by statistical thermodynamics is illustrated, and applied to the case

the minimum entropy production, which applies only to the linear regime near a
stationary thermodynamically non-equilibrium state and the maximum entropy
principle under the scale invariance restrictions. This procedure may be
adopted for a system subject to an arbitrary number of thermodynamic forces,
however, for concreteness, we analyze, afterwords, a magnetically confined
plasma subject to three thermodynamic forces, and three energy sources: i) the
total Ohmic heat, supplied by the transformer coil, ii) the energy supplied by
Neutral Beam Injection (NBI), and iii) the RF energy supplied by Ion Cyclotron
Resonant Heating (ICRH) system which heats the minority population. In this
limit case, we show that the derived expression of the distribution function is
more general than that one, which is currently used for fitting the numerical
steady-state solutions obtained by simulating the plasma by gyro-kinetic codes.
An application to a simple model of fully ionized plasmas submitted to an
external source is discussed. Through kinetic theory, we fixed the values of
the free parameters linking them with the external power supplies. The
singularity at low energy in the proposed distribution function is related to
the intermittency in the turbulent plasma.

coupled. It is therefore important to simulate both tissue morphogenesis and

resolution of the processes depends on the questions of interest. As part of
this chapter we will introduce different descriptions of tissue morphogenesis.
In the most simple approximation tissue is a continuous domain and tissue
expansion is described according to a pre-defined function of time (and
possibly space). In a slightly more advanced version the expansion speed and
direction of the tissue may depend on a signaling variable that evolves on the
domain. Both versions will be referred to as 'prescribed growth'. Alternatively
tissue can be regarded as incompressible fluid and can be described with
Navier-Stokes equations. Local cell expansion, proliferation, and death are
then incorporated by a source term. In other applications the cell boundaries
may be important and cell-based models must be introduced. Finally, cells may
move within the tissue, a process best described by agent-based models.

are both considered as potential progenitors for the formation of supermassive
black holes. They are expected to form from rapidly accreting protostars in
massive primordial halos. We explore how long rapidly accreting protostars
remain on the Hayashi track, implying large protostellar radii and weak
accretion luminosity feedback. We assess the potential role of energy
production in the nuclear core, and determine what regulates the evolution of
such protostars into quasi-stars or supermassive stars. We follow the
contraction of characteristic mass scales in rapidly accreting protostars, and
infer the timescales for them to reach nuclear densities. We compare the
characteristic timescales for nuclear burning with those for which the extended
protostellar envelope can be maintained. We find that the extended envelope can
be maintained up to protostellar masses of 3.6x10^8 \dot{m}^3 solar, where
\dot{m} denotes the accretion rate in solar masses per year. We expect the
nuclear core to exhaust its hydrogen content in 7x10^6 yrs. If accretion rates
\dot{m}>>0.14 can still be maintained at this point, a black hole may form
within the accreting envelope, leading to a quasi-star. Alternatively, the
accreting object will gravitationally contract to become a main-sequence
supermassive star. Due to the limited gas reservoir in dark matter halos with
10^7 solar masses, the accretion rate onto the central object may drop at late
times, implying the formation of supermassive stars as the typical outcome of
direct collapse. However, if high accretion rates are maintained, a quasi-star
with an interior black hole may form.

rapidities in proton-nucleus collisions provides direct information about high
gluon density effects, like gluon saturation, in the nuclear wavefunction. In
the kinematical conditions for proton-lead collisions at the LHC, the forward
di-hadron production is dominated by partonic processes in which a gluon from
the proton splits into a pair of gluons, while undergoing multiple scattering
off the dense gluon system in the nucleus. We compute the corresponding
cross-section using the Colour Glass Condensate effective theory, which enables
us to include the effects of multiple scattering and gluon saturation in the
leading logarithmic approximation at high energy. This opens the way towards
systematic studies of angular correlations in two-gluon production, similar to
previous studies for quark-gluon production in the literature. We consider in
more detail two special kinematical limits: the ""back-to-back correlation
limit"", where the transverse momenta of the produced gluons are much larger
than the nuclear saturation momentum, and the ""double parton scattering limit"",
where the two gluons are produced by a nearly collinear splitting occurring
prior to the collision. We argue that saturation effects remain important even
for relatively high transverse momenta (i.e. for nearly back-to-back
configurations), leading to geometric scaling in the azimuthal distribution.

demonstrate that the addition of a ""filtering"" biocatalytic process leads to a
considerable reduction of the noise transmission factor and the resulting gate

an indicator of liver damage, but only if both of these of the inputs are

earlier that in the regime of extreme pattern dilution, a system with $N_T$
T-lymphocytes can manage a number $N_B!=!\order(N_T^\delta)$ of B-lymphocytes
simultaneously, with $\delta!<!1$. Here we study this model in the extensive

agreement with immunological findings. We use graph theory and statistical
mechanical analysis based on replica methods to show that in the
finite-connectivity regime, where each T-lymphocyte interacts with a finite
number of B-lymphocytes as $N_T\to\infty$, the T-lymphocytes can coordinate
effective immune responses to an extensive number of distinct antigen invasions
in parallel. As $\alpha$ increases, the system eventually undergoes a second
order transition to a phase with clonal cross-talk interference, where the
system's performance degrades gracefully. Mathematically, the model is
equivalent to a spin system on a finitely connected graph with many short

the recent experiments with muonic hydrogen induced news discussions on the
subject, and now some physicists are ready to adopt the exotic properties of
muon, lying beyond the Standard Model, in order to explain the difference
between the results of muonic hydrogen experiments (r=0.84087(39) fm) and
CODATA-2010 value r=0.8775(51) fm based on electron-proton scattering and H
spectroscopy. In the present contribution we suggest a way to achieve a
progress in the entire problem via paying attention on a logical inconsistency
of fundamental equations of atomic physics, constructed by analogy with
corresponding classical equations without, however, taking into account a
purely bound nature of electromagnetic field generated by electrically bound
particles in the stationary energy states. We suggest eliminating this
inconsistency via introducing some appropriate correcting factors into these
equations, which involve the requirement of total momentum conservation in the
system of bound particles in the absence of electromagnetic radiation. We
further show that this approach allows not only eliminating long-standing
discrepancies between theory and experiment in physics of simple atoms, but
also yields the same estimation for the proton size in the classic 2S-2P Lamb
shift in hydrogen, 1S Lamb shift in hydrogen, and 2S-2P Lamb shift in muonic
hydrogen, with the mean value r=0.841 fm. Finally, we suggest the crucial
experiment for verification of the validity of pure bound field corrections:
the measurement of lifetime of bound moun in meso-atoms with large Z, where the
standard calculations and our predictions essentially deviate from each other,
and some of the available experimental results (Yovanovitch, Phys. Rev. 117

of diverging exponentially with the distance from the critical point, the

different parts of the world we need to have an expertise in their respective
languages. Learning all these languages is not at all possible; therefore we
need a mechanism which can do this task for us. Machine translators have
emerged as a tool which can perform this task. In order to develop a machine
translator we need to develop several different rules. The very first module
that comes in machine translation pipeline is morphological analysis. Stemming
and lemmatization comes under morphological analysis. In this paper we have
created a lemmatizer which generates rules for removing the affixes along with
the addition of rules for creating a proper root word.

first presented by Aguirre et al. (2011) and Rosolowsky et al. (2010). The BGPS
is a 1.1 mm survey of dust emission in the Northern galactic plane, covering
longitudes -10 < \ell < 90 and latitudes |b| < 0.5 with a typical 1-\sigma RMS
sensitivity of 30-100 mJy in a 33"" beam. Version 2 of the survey includes an
additional 20 square degrees of coverage in the 3rd and 4th quadrants and 2
square degrees in the 1st quadrant. The new data release has improved angular
recovery, with complete recovery out to 80"" and partial recovery to 300"", and
reduced negative bowls around bright sources resulting from the atmospheric
subtraction process. We resolve the factor of 1.5 flux calibration offset
between the v1.0 data release and other data sets and determine that there is
no offset between v2.0 and other data sets. The v2.0 pointing accuracy is
tested against other surveys and demonstrated to be accurate and an improvement
over v1.0. We present simulations and tests of the pipeline and its properties,
including measurements of the pipeline's angular transfer function. The Bolocat
cataloging tool was used to extract a new catalog, which includes 8594 sources,
with 591 in the expanded regions. We have demonstrated that the Bolocat 40"" and
80"" apertures are accurate even in the presence of strong extended background
emission. The number of sources is lower than in v1.0, but the amount of flux
and area included in identified sources is larger.

congruence. Finally, we investigate the complete lattice of congruences of a
completely inverse $AG^{**}$-groupoids. In particular, we describe congruences
on completely inverse $AG^{**}$-groupoids by their kernel and trace.

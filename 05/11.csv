$f(\phi,\chi)=\mathrm{Tr}\,\Omega\rho$ as a function of $\phi$ and $\chi$ is a
nonnegative biquadratic form. Every zero of $f(\phi,\chi)$ imposes real-linear
constraints on $f$ and $\Omega$. The Hessian matrix at the zero must be
nonnegative. Its eigenvectors with zero eigenvalue, if any, we call Hessian
zeros. A zero of $f(\phi,\chi)$ is quadratic if it has no Hessian zeros,
otherwise it is quartic. We call a witness quadratic if it has only quadratic
zeros, and quartic otherwise. We prove that a witness is extremal if and only
if no other witness has the same, or a larger, set of zeros and Hessian zeros.
A quadratic extremal witness has a minimum number of isolated zeros depending
on dimensions. If a witness is not extremal, the constraints defined by its
zeros and Hessian zeros determine all directions in which to search for
witnesses having more zeros or Hessian zeros. A finite number of iterated
searches in random directions lead to an extremal witness which is usually
quadratic with the minimum number of zeros. We discuss some topics related to
extremal witnesses, in particular the relation between the facial structures of
the dual sets of witnesses and separable states. We discuss the relation
between extremality and optimality of witnesses, and a conjecture of

those outside of the shape. Each participant was assigned to one particular

differences. The paper also presents triangulation based algorithms for
reconstruction and recognition of a shape from a set of isolated dots.
Experiments showed that the algorithms were more effective and perceptually

Detailed analysis of the synthetic observables provides insight into how
observations should be analyzed to derive information about physical variables

optically thin atmosphere requires the combination of Doppler shifts and
spectral line asymmetry to determine the velocity in the jet. Other properties
differ from the observations, especially in the chromospheric lines. The mass
density of the part of the spicule with a chromospheric temperature is too low

discrepancies are described in detail, and we discuss which mechanisms and

routinely use a variety of manuscript preparation, correction or editing
services, a practice that is openly endorsed by many journals and scientific
institutions. These services vary tremendously in their scope; at one end there
is simple proof-reading, and at the other extreme there is in-depth and
extensive peer-reviewing, proposal preparation, statistical analyses,
re-writing and co-writing. In this paper, the various types of service are
reviewed, along with authorship guidelines, and the question is raised of
whether the high-end services surpass most guidelines' criteria for authorship.
Three other factors are considered. First, the ease of collaboration possible
in the internet era allows multiple iterations between authors and the editing
service, so essentially, papers can be co-written. Second, 'editing services'
often offer subject-specific experts who comment not only on the language, but
interpret and improve scientific content. Third, the trend towards heavily
multi-authored papers implies that the threshold necessary to earn authorship
is declining. The inevitable conclusion is that at some point the contributions
by 'editing services' should be deemed sufficient to warrant authorship. Trying
to enforce any guidelines would likely be futile, but nevertheless, it might be
time to revisit the ethics of using some of the high-end 'editing services'. In
an increasingly international job market, recognizing this problem might prove
progressively more important in authorship disputes, the allocation of research

succeed in building and deploying complex software solutions, an architecture
is essential. For many in the industry structured reviews of these
architectures is also de rigor. Practices for such reviews have been developed
and reported on for years. One aspect that does not receive as much attention
but is no less important is the relationship between these architectures and
the requirements for deploying them into production environments. At Wolters
Kluwer's Corporate Legal Services we first established a typical architecture
review process and then established a two phase production preparation review
process. This paper describes in detail how these practices work and some of
the technical results of these reviews including the frequency and style of the
reviews, the process automation around them, and the number and nature of some
of the technical flaws eliminated by enforcing these reviews. This paper lays
the ground work for others who would be interested in following similar
practices.

moduli in n-dimensions and we study the suggested spherically symmetric
classical geometry in n=4 in detail, identifying two 1-parameter subcases where
the Einstein tensor matches that of a perfect fluid for (a) positive pressure,
zero density and (b) negative pressure and positive density with ratio
w_Q=-{1\over 2}. The classical geometry is conformally flat and its geodesics
motivate new coordinates which we extend to the quantum case as a new
description of the quantum spacetime model as a quadratic algebra. The
noncommutative Riemannian geometry is fully solved for $n=2$ and includes the
quantum Levi-Civita connection and a second, nonperturbative, Levi-Civita
connection which blows up as \lambda\to 0. We also propose a `quantum Einstein
tensor' which is identically zero for the main part of the moduli space of
connections (as classically in 2D). However, when the quantum Ricci tensor and
metric are viewed as deformations of their classical counterparts there would
be an O(\lambda^2) correction to the classical Einstein tensor and an
O(\lambda) correction to the classical metric.

weak-measurement-based procedure for directly measuring a sub-system's density
matrix should yield, under appropriate circumstances, the Bohmian ""conditional

position, allowing determinations of effective volume as a function of
luminosity. We fit the faint-end slope of the luminosity function to be alpha =
-1.74 +/-0.08, consistent with the values obtained for 2.5 < z < 6. There is no
turnover in the luminosity function down to MUV = -13. The trend of
increasingly redder UV spectral slopes with luminosity at higher redshifts is
observed in our sample, but with redder slopes at all luminosities and average
reddening of < E(B - V) >= 0.15. We assume the stars in these galaxies are
metal poor (0.2Z_sun) compared to their brighter counterparts (Z_sun),

extinction. The total UV luminosity density at z ~ 2 is 4.31x10^26

a Kroupa IMF) of 0.148 M/yr/Mpc^3, significantly higher than previous

a new phase with the discovery of a Standard Model (SM)-like Higgs at the LHC.
The measurement of Higgs couplings and direct searches for additional scalars
provide complementary avenues for the discovery of new degrees of freedom. This
complementarity is particularly sharp in two Higgs doublet models (2HDMs) where
the couplings of the SM-like Higgs may be directly related to the LHC signals
of additional scalars. In this work we develop a strategy for searching for the
second Higgs doublet given the LHC signals of the recently discovered SM-like
Higgs. We focus on a motivated parameter space of flavor- and CP-conserving
2HDMs in which the couplings of all scalars to SM states are controlled by two
parameters. We construct fits in this parameter space to the signals of the
SM-like Higgs and translate these fits into signal expectations for future
measurements of both the SM-like Higgs and additional scalars, identifying the
most promising search channels for discovery or exclusion of new physics. When
kinematically accessible, decays of the heavy neutral scalar Higgs to two light
Higgs scalars, $H \to hh$, and decays of the pseudoscalar Higgs to a light
Higgs scalar and $Z$ boson, $A \to Zh$, provide promising avenues for discovery
even when the couplings of the light Higgs are within a few percent of SM
predictions. When the couplings of the light Higgs are exceptionally close to
those of the SM, decays of heavier neutral scalars to $\gamma \gamma$ and
$\tau^+ \tau^-$ become particularly important for discovery.

consequences of ignition at several locations within such dwarfs. Here we
assume central ignition, which has been explored before, however, the problem
is worth revisiting, if only to validate those previous studies and to further
elucidate the relevant physics for future work. A perturbed sphere of hot iron
ash with a radius of ~100 km is initialized at the middle of the star. The
subsequent explosion is followed in several simulations using a thickened flame
model in which the flame speed is either fixed --- within the range expected
from turbulent combustion --- or based on the local turbulent intensity. Global
results, including the explosion energy and bulk nucleosynthesis (e.g. 56Ni of
0.48--0.56 $\Msun$) turn out to be insensitive to this speed. In all completed
runs, the energy released by the nuclear burning is adequate to unbind the
star, but not enough to give the energy and brightness of typical SNe Ia. As
found previously, the chemical stratification observed in typical events is not
reproduced. These models produce a large amount of unburned carbon and oxygen
in central low velocity regions, which is inconsistent with spectroscopic
observations, and the intermediate mass elements and iron group elements are
strongly mixed during the explosion.

generalize and extend a manifestly unitary field theoretical method to obtain
the time evolution of the quantum state. We consider the decay of a light
scalar field with mass $M\ll H$ with a cubic coupling in de Sitter space-time.
Radiative corrections feature an infrared enhancement manifest as poles in
$\Delta=M^2/3H^2$ and we obtain the quantum state in an expansion in $\Delta$.
To leading order in $\Delta$ the pure state density matrix describing the decay

the wave equation is obtained from Einstein's equations and how many and how
are the polarization modes of these waves. It is discussed the reasons why GWs
sources should be of astrophysical or cosmological origin. Thus, it is
discussed what would be the most likely sources of GWs to be detected by the
detectors of GWs currently in operation and those that should be operational in
the future, emphasizing in particular the sources involving compact objects.
The compact objects such as neutron stars, black holes and binary systems
involving compact stars can be important sources of GWs. Last but not least, it
is discussed the GWs astrophysics that is already possible to do, in particular
involving the compact objects.

  Minimizing $L_p$ Norm of Costs","16 pages",,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the problem of locating a single facility on the real line. This
facility serves a set of agents, each of whom is located on the line, and
incurs a cost equal to his distance from the facility. An agent's location is
private information that is known only to him. Agents report their location to
a central planner who decides where to locate the facility. The planner's
objective is to minimize a ""social"" cost function that depends on the
agent-costs. However, agents might not report truthfully; to address this
issue, the planner must restrict himself to {\em strategyproof} mechanisms, in
which truthful reporting is a dominant strategy for each agent. A mechanism
that simply chooses the optimal solution is generally not strategyproof, and so
the planner aspires to use a mechanism that effectively {\em approximates} his
objective function. In our paper, we study the problem described above with the
social cost function being the $L_p$ norm of the vector of agent-costs. We show
that the median mechanism (which is known to be strategyproof) provides a
$2^{1-\frac{1}{p}}$ approximation ratio, and that is the optimal approximation
ratio among all deterministic strategyproof mechanisms. For randomized
mechanisms, we present two results. First, we present a negative result: we
show that for integer $\infty>p>2$, no mechanism---from a rather large class of
randomized mechanisms--- has an approximation ratio better than that of the
median mechanism. This is in contrast to the case of $p=2$ and $p=\infty$ where
a randomized mechanism provably helps improve the worst case approximation
ratio. Second, for the case of 2 agents, we show that a mechanism called LRM,
first designed by Procaccia and Tennenholtz for the special case of
$L_{\infty}$, provides the optimal approximation ratio among all randomized
mechanisms.

tidal debris (streams and other unbound substructure) in fully cosmological
simulations of structure formation. We use one tracking and three non-tracking
codes to identify substructure (bound and unbound) in a Milky Way type
simulation from the Aquarius suite (Springel et al., 2008) and post-process
their output with a common pipeline to determine the properties of these
substructures in a uniform way. By using output from a fully cosmological
simulation, we also take a step beyond previous studies of tidal debris that
have used simple toy models. We find that both tracking and non-tracking codes
agree well on the identification of subhaloes and more importantly, the {\em
unbound tidal features} associated with them. The distributions of basic
properties of the total substructure distribution (mass, velocity dispersion,
position) are recovered with a scatter of $\sim20%$. Using the tracking code as
our reference, we show that the non-tracking codes identify complex tidal
debris with purities of $\sim40%$. Analysing the results of the substructure
finders, we find that the general distribution of {\em substructures} differ
significantly from the distribution of bound {\em subhaloes}. Most importantly,
both bound and unbound {\em substructures} together constitute $\sim18%$ of the
host halo mass, which is a factor of $\sim2$ higher than the fraction in
self-bound {\em subhaloes}. However, this result is restricted by the remaining
challenge to cleanly define when an unbound structure has become part of the
host halo. Nevertheless, the more general substructure distribution provides a
more complete picture of a halo's accretion history.

variational formulations of symmetric saddle point systems. The algorithm is
based on availability of families of stable finite element pairs and on the
availability of fast and accurate solvers for it symmetric positive definite
systems. On each fixed level an efficient solver such as the gradient or the
conjugate gradient algorithm for inverting a Schur complement is implemented.
The level change criterion follows the cascade principle and requires that the
iteration error be close to the expected discretization error. We prove new
estimates that relate the iteration error and the residual for the constraint
equation. The new estimates are the key ingredients in imposing an efficient
level change criterion. The first iteration on each new level uses information
about the best approximation of the discrete solution from the previous level.
The theoretical results and experiments show that the algorithms achieve
optimal or close to optimal approximation rates by performing a non-increasing
number of iterations on each level. Even though numerical results supporting
the efficiency of the algorithms are presented for the Stokes system, the
algorithms can be applied to a large class of boundary value problems,
including first order systems that can be reformulated at the continuous level
as symmetric saddle point problems, such as the Maxwell equations.

bright GRB 130427A at z=0.340, spanning 0.67 to 12 days after the burst. Taken
in conjunction with detailed multi-band UV, optical, NIR, and X-ray
observations we find that the broad-band afterglow emission is composed of
distinct reverse shock and forward shock contributions. The reverse shock
emission dominates in the radio/millimeter and at <0.1 days in the
UV/optical/NIR, while the forward shock emission dominates in the X-rays and at
>0.1 days in the UV/optical/NIR. We further find that the optical and X-ray
data require a Wind circumburst environment, pointing to a massive star
progenitor. Using the combined forward and reverse shock emission we find that
the parameters of the burst are an isotropic kinetic energy of E_Kiso~2e53 erg,
a mass loss rate of Mdot~3e-8 Msun/yr (for a wind velocity of 1,000 km/s), and
a Lorentz factor at the deceleration time of Gamma(200s)~130. Due to the low
density and large isotropic energy, the absence of a jet break to ~15 days
places only a weak constraint on the opening angle of theta_j>2.5 deg, and
therefore a total energy of E_gamma+E_K>1.2e51 erg, similar to other GRBs. The
reverse shock emission is detectable in this burst due to the low circumburst
density, which leads to a slow cooling shock. We speculate that this is a
required property for the detectability of reverse shocks in the radio and
millimeter bands. Following on GRB 130427A as a benchmark event, observations
of future GRBs with the exquisite sensitivity of VLA and ALMA, coupled with
detailed modeling of the reverse and forward shock contributions will test this
hypothesis.

architectures such as distributed antenna systems (DAS), however, promise to
boost cell-edge SNR, creating the environment needed to realize practical IA
gains. Existing IA solutions cannot be applied to DAS as they neglect the
per-remote-radio power constraints imposed on distributed precoders. This paper
considers two types of distributed antenna IA systems: ones with a limit on
maximum per-radio power, and ones with a strict equality constraint on
per-radio power. The rate-loss incurred by a simple power back-off strategy,
used in systems with maximum power constraints, is characterized analytically.
It is also shown that enforcing strict power constraints avoids such a
rate-loss but negatively affects IA feasibility. For such systems, an IA
algorithm is proposed and feasibility conditions are derived based on the
concept of system properness. Finally, numerical results validate the analysis
and demonstrate that IA and DAS can be successfully combined to mitigate
inter-cell interference and improve performance for most mobile users,

Surveys have leveraged both high spectroscopic resolution enabling internal
velocity measurements and high spatial resolution from AO techniques and sites
with excellent natural seeing. For the first time, we have been able to glimpse
the kinematic state of matter in young, assembling star-forming galaxies and
learn detailed astrophysical information about the physical processes and
compare their kinematic scaling relations with those in the local Universe.
Observers have measured disc galaxy rotation, merger signatures, and
turbulence-enhanced velocity dispersions of gas-rich discs. Theorists have
interpreted kinematic signatures of galaxies in a variety of ways (rotation,
merging, outflows, and feedback) and attempted to discuss evolution vs.
theoretical models and relate it to the evolution in galaxy morphology. A key
point that has emerged from this activity is that substantial fractions of
high-redshift galaxies have regular kinematic morphologies despite irregular
photometric morphologies and this is likely due to the presence of a large
number of highly gas-rich discs. There has not yet been a review of this
burgeoning topic. In this first Dawes review, I will discuss the extensive

phenomena that one would like to explain are, for example, convergence to

correlations (entanglement), or the emergence of heat and particle fluxes in

the main challenges is to derive the irreversible dynamics of the open system,
starting from a unitary dynamics of the system and its environment.
  The repeated interactions systems considered in these notes are models of
non-equilibrium quantum statistical mechanics. They are relevant in quantum
optics, and more generally, serve as a relatively well treatable approximation
of a more difficult quantum dynamics. In particular, the repeated interaction
models allow to determine the large time (stationary) asymptotics of quantum

important task. In many scientific fields, appropriate scores were tailored to
tackle the problems at hand. A proper score is a popular tool to obtain
statistically consistent forecasts. Furthermore, a mathematical
characterization of the proper score was studied. As a result, it was revealed
that the proper score corresponds to a Bregman divergence, which is an
extension of the squared distance over the set of probability distributions. In
the present paper, we introduce composite scores as an extension of the typical
scores in order to obtain a wider class of probabilistic forecasting. Then, we
propose a class of composite scores, named Holder scores, that induce
equivariant estimators. The equivariant estimators have a favorable property,
implying that the estimator is transformed in a consistent way, when the data
is transformed. In particular, we deal with the affine transformation of the
data. By using the equivariant estimators under the affine transformation, one
can obtain estimators that do no essentially depend on the choice of the system
of units in the measurement. Conversely, we prove that the Holder score is
characterized by the invariance property under the affine transformations.
Furthermore, we investigate statistical properties of the estimators using
Holder scores for the statistical problems including estimation of regression
functions and robust parameter estimation, and illustrate the usefulness of the
newly introduced scores for statistical forecasting.

fractions of the blue supergiants having different histories depend on the
internal mixing and mass-loss during the red supergiant stage. We study the
possibility to use diagnostics based on stellar pulsation to discriminate blue
supergiants having different evolution histories. For this purpose we have
studied the pulsation property of massive star models calculated with the
Geneva stellar evolution code for initial masses ranging from 8 to 50 M$_\odot$
with a solar metallicity of $Z=0.014$. We have found that radial pulsations are
excited in the blue-supergiant region only in the models that had been
red-supergiants before. This would provide us with a useful mean to diagnose
the history of evolution of each blue-supergiant. At a given effective
temperature, much more nonradial pulsations are excited in the model after the
red-supergiant stage than in the model evolving towards the red-supergiant. The
properties of radial and nonradial pulsations in blue supergiants are
discussed. Predicted periods are compared with period ranges observed in some
\alpha-Cygni variables in the Galaxy and NGC 300. We have found that blue
supergiant models after the red-supergiant stage roughly agree with observed
period ranges in most cases. However, we are left with the puzzle that the
predicted surface N/C and N/O ratios seem to be too high compared with those of
Deneb and Rigel.

separate fluid systems where they can exchange momentum through collisions.
However, ions have direct interaction with the magnetic field lines but
neutrals are not affected by the field directly. The equations of our two-fluid
model are linearized and by applying a set of proper boundary conditions, a
general dispersion relation is derived for our two superposed fluids separated
by a horizontal boundary. We found two unstable modes for a range of the
wavenumbers. It seems that one of the unstable modes corresponds to the ions
and the other one is for the neutrals. Both modes are reduced with increasing
the collision rate of the particles and the ionization fraction. We show that
if the two-fluid nature is considered, RT instability would not be suppressed
and also show that the growth time of the perturbations increases. As an
example, we apply our analysis to the Local clouds which seems to have arisen
because of the RT instability. Assuming that the clouds are partially ionized,

that have signatures of cool dust but lack significant near infra-red emission
from warm dust) are associated with the presence of planets (or brown dwarfs).
These are assumed to filter the dust content of any gas flow within the
planetary orbit and produce an inner `opacity hole'. In order to match the
properties of transition discs with the largest (~50 A.U. scale) holes, we
place such `planets' at large radii in massive discs and then follow the
evolution of the tidally coupled disc-planet system, comparing the system's
evolution in the plane of mm flux against hole radius with the properties of
observed transition discs. We find that, on account of the high disc masses in
these systems, all but the most massive `planets' (100 Jupiter masses) are
conveyed to small radii by Type II migration without significant fading at
millimetre wavelengths. Such behaviour would contradict the observed lack of mm
bright transition discs with small (<10 A.U.) holes. On the other hand, imaging
surveys clearly rule out the presence of such massive companions in transition
discs. We conclude that this is a serious problem for models that seek to
explain transition discs in terms of planetary companions unless some mechanism
can be found to halt inward migration and/or suppress mm flux production. We
suggest that the dynamical effects of substantial accretion on to the
planet/through the gap may offer the best prospect for halting such migration
but that further long term simulations are required to clarify this issue.

observations were made of molecular line emission from 16 globulettes

we collected information from several transitions in 12CO and 13CO were
modelled using a spherically symmetric model. The best fit to observed line
ratios and intensities was obtained by assuming a model composed of a cool and
dense centre and warm and dense surface layer. The average masses derived range
from about 50 to 500 Jupiter masses, which is similar to earlier estimates
based on extinction measures. The globulettes selected are dense, with very
thin layers of fluorescent H2 emission. The NIR data shows that several
globulettes are very opaque and contain dense cores. Because of the high
density encountered already at the surface, the rims become thin, as evidenced
by our P beta images.
  We conclude that the entire complex of shells, elephant trunks, and
globulettes in the northern part of the nebula is expanding with nearly the
same velocity of ~22 km/s, and with a very small spread in velocity among the
globulettes. Some globulettes are in the process of detaching from elephant
trunks and shells, while other more isolated objects must have detached long
ago and are lagging behind in the general expansion of the molecular shell. The
suggestion that some globulettes might collapse to form planetary-mass objects
or brown dwarfs is strengthened by our finding of dense cores in several
objects.

convex nonlinearities we prove that the extremal solution is bounded in
dimensions $n<4s$. We also show that, for exponential and power-like
nonlinearities, the extremal solution is bounded whenever $n<10s$. In the limit
$s\uparrow1$, $n<10$ is optimal. In addition, we show that the extremal
solution is $H^s(\R^n)$ in any dimension whenever the domain is convex.

linear Dirichlet problem for the fractional Laplacian with $L^p$ data. We prove
optimal $L^q$ and $C^\beta$ estimates, depending on the value of $p$. These
estimates follow from classical embedding results for the Riesz potential in
$\R^n$.

magnetic field induced transition becomes the dominant decay channel for the
light elements even in a relatively weak magnetic field, and it will therefore
prove useful in diagnostics of the strength of magnetic fields in different
plasmas. The influence of an external magnetic field on the lifetime of the

show that if a cutoff surface is close to a horizon of the D0-brane black hole,

the hydrodynamics exactly, which is consistent with previous works on a Rindler

to trigger, to watch, and to control atomic and molecular motion. This tutorial
focuses on experimental and theoretical advances which are used to study the
dynamics of electrons and molecules in the presence of ultrashort pulses. In
the first part, the rotational dynamics of molecules, which happens on
picosecond and femtosecond time scales, is reviewed. Well-aligned molecules are
particularly suitable for angle-dependent investigations like x-ray diffraction
or strong-field ionization experiments. In the second part, the ionization
dynamics of atoms is studied. The characteristic time scale lies, here, in the
attosecond to few-femtosecond regime. Although a one-particle picture has been
successfully applied to many processes, many-body effects do constantly occur.
After a broad overview of the main mechanisms and the most common tools in
attosecond physics, examples of many-body dynamics in the attosecond world
(e.g., in high-harmonic generation and attosecond transient absorption
spectroscopy) are discussed.

The NECPA is formulated by contour ordered nonequilibrium Green's function
(NEGF) where the disorder average is carried out within the coherent potential
approximation on the complex-time contour. We have derived a set of new rules
that supplement the celebrated Langreth theorem and, as a whole, the

averaged nonequilibrium density matrix as well as other relevant quantities for
quantum transport calculations. We establish the excellent accuracy of NECPA by
comparing its results to brute force numerical calculations of disordered
tight-binding models. Moreover, the connection of NECPA equations which are
derived on the complex-time contour, to the nonequilibrium vertex correction
theory which is derived on the real-time axis, is made. As an application, we
demonstrate that NECPA can be combined with density functional theory to enable
analysis of nanoelectronic device physics from atomistic first principles.

Schr\""odinger equation is proposed to describe the time evolution of a quantum
dissipative system under continuous measurement. Within the Bohmian mechanics
framework, a solution to this equation reveals a novel result: it displays a
time constant which should represent the dividing line between the quantum and
classical trajectories. It is shown that continuous measurements and damping
not only disturb the particle but compel the system to converge in time to a
Newtonian regime. While the width of the wave packet may reach a stationary
regime, its quantum trajectories converge exponentially in time to classical
trajectories. In particular, it is shown that damping tends to suppress further
quantum effects on a time scale shorter than the relaxation time of the system.
If the initial wave packet width is taken to be equal to 2.8 10^{-15} m (the
approximate size of an electron), the Bohmian time constant is found to have an
upper limit, i. e., ${\tau_{B\max}} = {10^{- 26}}s$.

graded modules for the current algebra associated to a simple Lie algebra.
These modules are indexed by a tuple of partitions one for each positive root
of the simple Lie algebra. We assume that the partitions satisfy a natural
compatibility condition. In the case when the partitions are all rectangular,
for instance, we prove that these are precisely the Demazure modules which are
stable under the action of the simple Lie algebra. As a consequence we see that
the defining relations of these Demazure modules can be greatly simplified. We
use this simplified presentation to relate our results to the fusion products
(defined by Feigin and Loktev) of representations of the current algebra. We
prove that the Q--system can be actually thought of as a canonical short exact
of the fusion products of representations associated to certain special
partitions. Finally, in the last section we deal with the case of sl(2) and
prove that the modules we define are just fusion products of irreducible
representations of the associated current algebra. We also give monomial bases
for these modules.

charges, both electric and magnetic, and a resulting linear system are
sufficient for the derivation of the generalized vacuum Maxwell equations with
both charges. The derivative admits another set of Maxwell equations for
charges that are the opposite-parity partners of the usual electric and
magnetic charges. These new charges and their photons are parts of the parallel
universe of dark matter.

the free induction algebra over the empty set (and at such allows definitions
of maps by primitive recursion) and it is the free monoid over a one-element
set, the latter structure being a consequence of the former. In this
contribution, we study the corresponding structure in the linear setting, i.e.,
in the category of modules over a commutative ring rather than in the category
of sets, namely the free module generated by the integers. It also provides
free structures of induction algebra and of monoid (in the category of
modules). Moreover we prove that each of its linear endomorphisms admits a
unique normal form, explicitly constructed, as a non-commutative formal power
series.

and triangles have been derived and verified in the existing work. All of these
geometric shapes are related to each other and have various applications in
wireless communications, transportation, etc. Hexagons are widely used to model
the cells in cellular networks, while trapezoids can be utilized to model the
edge users in a cellular network with a hexagonal tessellation. In this report,
the distributions of the random distances associated with unit trapezoids are
derived, when two random points are within a unit trapezoid or in two neighbor
unit trapezoids. The mathematical expressions are verified through simulation.
Further, we present the polynomial fit for the PDFs, which can be used to
simplify the computation.

(sub-100fs) of the non-equilibrium dynamics of photo-excited electrons in
graphene. We employ the semiclassical Boltzmann equation with a collision
integral that includes contributions from electron-electron (e-e) and
electron-optical phonon interactions. Taking advantage of circular symmetry and
employing the massless Dirac Fermion (MDF) Hamiltonian, we are able to perform
an essentially analytical study of the e-e contribution to the collision
integral. This allows us to take particular care of subtle collinear scattering
processes - processes in which incoming and outgoing momenta of the scattering
particles lie on the same line - including carrier multiplication (CM) and
Auger recombination (AR). These processes have a vanishing phase space for two
dimensional MDF bare bands. However, we argue that electron-lifetime effects,
seen in experiments based on angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, provide
a natural pathway to regularize this pathology, yielding a finite contribution
due to CM and AR to the Coulomb collision integral. Finally, we discuss in
detail the role of physics beyond the Fermi golden rule by including screening
in the matrix element of the Coulomb interaction at the level of the Random
Phase Approximation (RPA), focusing in particular on the consequences of
various approximations including static RPA screening, which maximizes the
impact of CM and AR processes, and dynamical RPA screening, which completely
suppresses them.

electronic commerce and online shopping nowadays. They have multiple slots to
provide deals with significant discounts to their visitors every day. The
current user traffic allocation mostly relies on human decisions. We study the
problem of automatically allocating the user traffic of a group-buying website
to different deals to maximize the total revenue and refer to it as the
Group-buying Allocation Problem (\GAP). The key challenge of \GAP\ is how to
handle the tipping point (lower bound) and the purchase limit (upper bound) of
each deal. We formulate \GAP\ as a knapsack-like problem with variable-sized
items and majorization constraints. Our main results for \GAP\ can be
summarized as follows. (1) We first show that for a special case of \GAP, in
which the lower bound equals the upper bound for each deal, there is a simple
dynamic programming-based algorithm that can find an optimal allocation in
pseudo-polynomial time. (2) The general case of \GAP\ is much more difficult
than the special case. To solve the problem, we first discover several
structural properties of the optimal allocation, and then design a two-layer
dynamic programming-based algorithm leveraging those properties. This algorithm
can find an optimal allocation in pseudo-polynomial time. (3) We convert the
two-layer dynamic programming based algorithm to a fully polynomial time
approximation scheme (FPTAS), using the technique developed in
\cite{ibarra1975fast}, combined with some careful modifications of the dynamic
programs. Besides these results, we further investigate some natural
generalizations of \GAP, and propose effective algorithms.

separated by semipermeable membranes: cell insides and cell walls. The assembly
of all cell insides and cell walls are termed symplast and apoplast,
respectively. Water transport is pressure driven in both, where osmosis plays
an essential role in membrane crossing. In this paper, a microscopic model of
water flow and transport of an osmotically active solute in a plant tissue is
considered. The model is posed on the scale of a single cell and the tissue is
assumed to be composed of periodically distributed cells. The flow in the
symplast can be regarded as a viscous Stokes flow, while Darcy's law applies in
the porous apoplast. Transmission conditions at the interface (semipermeable
membrane) are obtained by balancing the mass fluxes through the interface and
by describing the protein mediated transport as a surface reaction. Applying
homogenization techniques, macroscopic equations for water and solute transport
in a plant tissue are derived. The macroscopic problem is given by a Darcy law
with a force term proportional to the difference in concentrations of the
osmotically active solute in the symplast and apoplast; i.e. the flow is also
driven by the local concentration difference and its direction can be different
than the one prescribed by the pressure gradient.

iteratively adding not only the sets that are definable over what has been

the correlator is equivalent to a gauge invariant correlation function of a
static quark anti-quark pair and a static adjoint quark, the resulting

representing losslessly a non-identity discrete function of the data encoded
independently by the encoders of several correlated sources with memory. This
paper investigates this problem under Markovian conditions, namely either the
sources or the functions considered are Markovian. We propose using linear
mappings over finite rings as encoders. If the function considered admits
certain polynomial structure, the linear encoders can make use of this
structure to establish ""implicit collaboration"" and boost the performance. In
fact, this approach universally applies to any scenario (arbitrary function)
because any discrete function admits a polynomial presentation of required
format.
  There are several useful discoveries in the paper. The first says that linear
encoder over non-field ring can be equally optimal for compressing data
generated by an irreducible Markov source. Secondly, regarding the previous
function-encoding problem, there are infinitely many circumstances where linear
encoder over non-field ring strictly outperforms its field counterpart. To be
more precise, it is seen that the set of coding rates achieved by linear
encoder over certain non-field rings is strictly larger than the one achieved
by the field version, regardless which finite field is considered. Therefore,
in this sense, linear coding over finite field is not optimal. In addition, for
certain scenarios where the sources do not possess the ergodic property, our
ring approach is still able to offer a solution.

the dwarf spheroidal galaxies surrounding the Milky Way. These are the most
dark matter dominated galaxies, and as such may be considered ideal
laboratories to test the current concordance cosmological model, and in
particular provide constraints on the nature of the dominant form of dark
matter. We discuss the latest observations of the kinematics of stars in these
systems, and how these may be used to derive their mass distribution. We tour
through the various dynamical techniques used, with emphasis on the
complementarity and limitations, and discuss what the results imply also in the
context of cosmological models. Finally we provide an outlook on exciting
developments in this field.

observed abundance anomalies, we assume that the super-massive stars had lost
significant parts of their initial masses when only a small mass fraction of

required mass loss might be caused by the super-Eddington radiation

This particle filter is referred to as the interacting multiple model-feedback

each discrete mode, and an exact filter recursion for the mode association

The interaction/merging process is also handled via a control-based approach.
The theoretical results are illustrated with the aid of a numerical example

10^{45.5} erg s^{-1} and 10^{44.9} erg s^{-1} (14--195 keV), respectively.
Based on the radio core luminosity, we estimate that the X-ray spectrum of 3C
206 contains a significant (~ 60% in the 14--195 keV band) contribution from
the jet, while it is negligible in PKS 0707-35. We can successfully model the
spectra with the jet component (for 3C 206), the transmitted emission, and two
reflection components from the torus and the accretion disk. The reflection
strengths from the torus are found to be R_{torus} (= \Omega/2\pi) = 0.29 +-
0.18 and 0.41 +- 0.18 for 3C 206 and PKS 0707-35, respectively, which are
smaller than those in typical Seyfert galaxies. Utilizing the torus model by
Ikeda et al. (2009), we quantify the relation between the half opening angle of
a torus (\theta_{oa}) and the equivalent width of an iron-K line. The observed
equivalent width of 3C 206, < 71 eV, constrain the column density in the
equatorial plane to N_{H}^{eq} < 10^{23} cm^{-2}, or the half opening angle to
\theta_{oa} > 80^\circ if N_{H}^{eq} = 10^{24} cm^{-2} is assumed. That of PKS
0707-35, 72 +- 36 eV, is consistent with N_{H}^{eq} ~ 10^{23} cm^{-2}. Our
results suggest that the tori in luminous radio-loud AGNs are only poorly
developed. The trend is similar to that seen in radio-quiet AGNs, implying that
the torus structure is not different between AGNs with jets and without jets.

  Lower-Bounded Facility Location",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The metric uncapacitated facility location problem (UFL) enjoys a special
stature in approximation algorithms as a testbed for various techniques. Two
generalizations of UFL are capacitated facility location (CFL) and
lower-bounded facility location (LBFL). In the former, every facility has a
capacity which is the maximum demand that can be assigned to it, while in the
latter, every open facility is required to serve a given minimum amount of
demand. Both CFL and LBFL are approximable within a constant factor but their
respective natural LP relaxations have an unbounded integrality gap. According
to Shmoys and Williamson, the existence of a relaxation-based algorithm for CFL
is one of the top 10 open problems in approximation algorithms.
  In this paper we give the first results on this problem. We provide
substantial evidence against the existence of a good LP relaxation for CFL by
showing unbounded integrality gaps for two families of strengthened
formulations.
  The first family we consider is the hierarchy of LPs resulting from repeated
applications of the lift-and-project Lov\'{a}sz-Schrijver procedure starting
from the standard relaxation. We show that the LP relaxation for CFL resulting
after $\Omega(n)$ rounds, where $n$ is the number of facilities in the
instance, has unbounded integrality gap. Note that the Lov\'{a}sz-Schrijver
procedure is known to yield an exact formulation for CFL in at most $n$ rounds.
  We also introduce the family of proper relaxations which generalizes to its
logical extreme the classic star relaxation, an equivalent form of the natural
LP. We characterize the integrality gap of proper relaxations for both LBFL and
CFL and show a threshold phenomenon under which it decreases from unbounded to
1.

""subtracting off"" the steady state of a linear parabolic partial differential

the start-up of the flow of, e.g., a Newtonian fluid between parallel plates,
it can lead to erroneous solutions to the corresponding problem for a class of
non-Newtonian fluids. We show that the reason for this is the non-rigorous
enforcement of the start-up condition in the textbook approach, which leads to
a violation of the principle of causality. Nevertheless, these boundary-value
problems can be solved correctly using eigenfunction expansions, and we present
the formulation that makes this possible (in essence, an application of
Duhamel's principle). The solutions obtained by this new approach are shown to
agree identically with those obtained by using the Laplace transform in time
only, a technique that enforces the proper start-up condition implicitly
(hence, the same error cannot be committed).

two independent constant parameters, which are respectively related to the mass
and angular momentum of the black hole in a particular way. As long as the
angular momentum does not vanish, the metric can have zero, one or two
horizons. The case with no horizon is physically uninteresting because of the
curvature singularity lying at the origin. We identified the necessary
conditions for at least one horizon to be present in the solution, which
imposes some bound on the mass-angular momentum ratio. For some particular
choice of parameters our solution degenerates into some previously known black

to transmit and receive/sense at the same time. Following a brief sensing
period, the SU can operate in either simultaneous transmit-and-sense (TS) mode
or simultaneous transmit-and-receive (TR) mode. We analytically study the
performance metrics for the two modes, namely the detection and false-alarm
probabilities, the PU outage probability, and the SU throughput. From this
analysis, we evaluate the sensing-throughput tradeoff for both modes. Our
objective is to find the optimal sensing and transmission durations for the SU

explore the spectrum awareness/efficiency tradeoff that arises from the two
modes by determining an efficient adaptive strategy for the SU link. This
strategy has a threshold structure, which depends on the PU traffic load. Our

of the source normally extends along PA -20 deg, in the 28 May 2009 and 23 July

stretched out nearly along the constant galactic latitude line with a local PA
40 deg, indicating that the direction of relative motion of the plasma lens is
close to orbital. Weaker but still detectable imaging patterns at similar
position angles are sporadically manifest at several other epochs. Modeling the
ESE that occurred in early 2009 and lasted ~0.14 yr, we determined that the
foreground screen has a double-lens structure, with proper motion (~6.8
mas/yr), and angular size (~0.27 mas). We also found that the angular
separation between the two brightest sub-images roughly follows a
wavelength-squared dependence expected from plasma scattering. Furthermore, by
analyzing archival non-simultaneous VLBA observations covering a wide frequency

permitted to use the spectrum allocated to the primary user as long as the
caused interference at the primary receiver is tolerable. With both secondary
SNR constraint and primary interference power constraint, we aim to minimize
the secondary transmit power consumption. By exploiting the individual SNR
requirements, we formulate this cognitive beamforming problem as an
optimization problem on the Stiefel manifold. Both zero forcing beamforming
(ZFB) and nonzero forcing beamforming (NFB) are considered. For the ZFB case,
we derive a closed form beamforming solution. For the NFB case, we prove that
the strong duality holds for the nonconvex primal problem and thus the optimal
solution can be easily obtained by solving the dual problem. Finally, numerical
results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed cognitive
beamforming solutions.

effects occurring in the interaction between coherent optical light and an
ensemble of $^{229}$Th nuclei are investigated theoretically. We consider the
scenario of nuclei doped in vacuum ultraviolet-vacuum ultraviolet transparent

therefore different lattice fields that broaden the nuclear transition width.
This effect is shown to come in interplay with interference effects due to the
hyperfine splitting of the ground and isomeric nuclear states. We investigate
possible experimentally available situations involving two-, three- and
four-level schemes of quadrupole sublevels of the ground and isomeric nuclear
states coupling to one or two coherent fields. Specific configurations which
offer clear signatures of the isomer excitation advantageous for the more
precise experimental determination of the transition energy are identified.
Furthermore, it is shown that population trapping into the isomeric state can
be achieved. This paves the way for further nuclear quantum optics applications
with $^{229}$Th such as nuclear coherent control.

Here we present a dynamical analysis of the photometry and three-dimensional
kinematics of omega Cen, 47 Tuc, and M15, by means of a recently introduced
family of self-consistent axisymmetric rotating models. The three clusters,
characterized by different relaxation conditions, show evidence of differential
rotation and deviations from sphericity. The combination of line-of-sight
velocities and proper motions allows us to determine their internal dynamics,
predict their morphology, and estimate their dynamical distance. The
well-relaxed cluster 47 Tuc is very well interpreted by our model; internal
rotation is found to explain the observed morphology. For M15, we provide a
global model in good agreement with the data, including the central behavior of
the rotation profile and the shape of the ellipticity profile. For the
partially relaxed cluster omega Cen, the selected model reproduces the complex
three-dimensional kinematics; in particular the observed anisotropy profile,
characterized by a transition from isotropy, to weakly-radial anisotropy, and
then to tangential anisotropy in the outer parts. The discrepancy found for the
steep central gradient in the observed line-of-sight velocity dispersion
profile and for the ellipticity profile is ascribed to the condition of only
partial relaxation of this cluster and the interplay between rotation and
radial anisotropy.

  breaking",,"Reports on Progress in Physics 75, 114502 (2012)","10.1088/0034-4885/75/11/114502",,"cond-mat.supr-con","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The orbital upper critical field $H_{c2} $ is evaluated for isotropic
materials with arbitrary transport and pair-breaking scattering rates. It is
shown that unlike transport scattering which enhances $H_{c2} $, the pair
breaking suppresses the upper critical field and reduces the dimensionless
ratio $h^*(0)=H_{c2}(0)/T_c(dH_{c2}/dT)_{T_c} $ from the Helfand-Werthamer
value of $\approx 0.7$ to 0.5 for a strong pair-breaking. $h^*(T)$ is evaluated
for arbitrary transport and pair-breaking scattering.
  A phenomenological model for the pair-breaking suppression by magnetic fields
is introduced. It shows qualitative features such as a positive curvature of
$H_{c2}(T) $ and the low temperature upturn usually associated with multi-band
superconductivity.

  Large Number of Colors",,"INTEGERS 14 (2014), Article A7",,,"math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In his 1984 AMS Memoir, George Andrews defined the family of $k$--colored
generalized Frobenius partition functions. These are denoted by $c\phi_k(n)$
where $k\geq 1$ is the number of colors in question. In that Memoir, Andrews
proved (among many other things) that, for all $n\geq 0,$ $c\phi_2(5n+3) \equiv
0\pmod{5}.$ Soon after, many authors proved congruence properties for various
$k$--colored generalized Frobenius partition functions, typically with a small
number of colors.
  Work on Ramanujan--like congruence properties satisfied by the functions
$c\phi_k(n)$ continues, with recent works completed by Baruah and Sarmah as
well as the author. Unfortunately, in all cases, the authors restrict their
attention to small values of $k.$ This is often due to the difficulty in
finding a ""nice"" representation of the generating function for $c\phi_k(n)$ for
large $k.$ Because of this, no Ramanujan--like congruences are known where $k$
is large. In this note, we rectify this situation by proving several infinite
families of congruences for $c\phi_k(n)$ where $k$ is allowed to grow
arbitrarily large. The proof is truly elementary, relying on a generating
function representation which appears in Andrews' Memoir but has gone
relatively unnoticed.

  Astrophysics",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201321628",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Flows on the solar surface are linked to solar activity, and LCT is one of
the standard techniques for capturing the dynamics of these processes by
cross-correlating solar images. However, the link between contrast variations
in successive images to the underlying plasma motions has to be quantitatively
confirmed. Radiation hydrodynamics simulations of solar granulation
(e.g.,CO5BOLD) provide access to both the wavelength-integrated, emergent
continuum intensity and the 3D velocity field at various heights in the solar
atmosphere. Thus, applying LCT to continuum images yields horizontal proper
motions, which are then compared to the velocity field of the simulated
(non-magnetic) granulation. In this study, we evaluate the performance of an
LCT algorithm previously developed for bulk-processing Hinode G-band images,
establish it as a quantitative tool for measuring horizontal proper motions,
and clearly work out the limitations of LCT or similar techniques designed to
track optical flows. Horizontal flow maps and frequency distributions of the
flow speed were computed for a variety of LCT input parameters including the
spatial resolution, the width of the sampling window, the time cadence of
successive images, and the averaging time used to determine persistent flow
properties. Smoothed velocity fields from the hydrodynamics simulation at three
atmospheric layers (log tau=-1,0,and +1) served as a point of reference for the
LCT results. LCT recovers many of the granulation properties, e.g.,the shape of
the flow speed distributions, the relationship between mean flow speed and
averaging time, and also--with significant smoothing of the simulated velocity
field--morphological features of the flow and divergence maps. However, the
horizontal proper motions are grossly underestimated by as much as a factor of
three. The LCT flows match best the flows deeper in the atmosphere at log
tau=+1.

Recently, the scaling limit of near-critical percolation was also constructed
by Garban, Pete and Schramm. The aim of this very modest contribution is to
explain how these results imply the convergence, as p tends to p_c, of the
Wulff crystal to a Euclidean disk. The main ingredient of the proof is the
rotational invariance of the scaling limit of near-critical percolation proved
by these three mathematicians.

dimension calculation on a given set $E$ (i. e., special relatively narrow
families of coverings leading to the classical Hausdorff dimension of an
arbitrary subset of $E$) and which are natural generalizations of comparable
net-coverings. They are shown to be very useful for the determination or
estimation of the Hausdorff dimension of sets and probability measures.
  We give general necessary and sufficient conditions for a covering family to
be faithful and new techniques for proving faithfulness/non-faithfulness for
the family of cylinders generated by expansions of real numbers. Motivated by
applications in the multifractal analysis of infinite Bernoulli convolutions,
we study in details the Cantor series expansion and prove necessary and
sufficient conditions for the corresponding net-coverings to be faithful. To
the best of our knowledge this is the first known sharp condition of the
faithfulness for a class of covering families containing both faithful and
non-faithful ones.
  Applying our results, we characterize fine fractal properties of probability
measures with independent digits of the Cantor series expansion and show that a
class of faithful net-coverings essentially wider that the class of comparable
ones. We construct, in particular, rather simple examples of faithful families
$\mathcal{A}$ of net-coverings which are ""extremely non-comparable"" to the
Hausdorff measure.

extension of the theory of bounded rationality. In particular, it is proposed
that a decision making process involves two components and these are the
correlation machine, which estimates missing values, and the causal machine,
which relates the cause to the effect. Rational decision making involves using
information which is almost always imperfect and incomplete as well as some
intelligent machine which if it is a human being is inconsistent to make
decisions. In the theory of bounded rationality this decision is made
irrespective of the fact that the information to be used is incomplete and
imperfect and the human brain is inconsistent and thus this decision that is to
be made is taken within the bounds of these limitations. In the theory of
semi-bounded rationality, signal processing is used to filter noise and
outliers in the information and the correlation machine is applied to complete
the missing information and artificial intelligence is used to make more
consistent decisions.

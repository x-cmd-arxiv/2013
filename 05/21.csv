often do so at the cost of memory comsumption and complex code. Real-life
software optimisation however lies in optimising at the same time speed and
memory usage as well as keeping code simple. This paper first presents some
thoughts on the available algorithms in terms of memory usage leading to a very
simple scan-line-based algorithm aiming at answering that challenge. Although
sub-optimal in terms of speed it is optimal if both speed and memory space are
taken together and is very easy to implement. For N segments and k
intersections it uses only N additional integers and lists the intersections in
O(N^1.26) or corrects them in O((N+k) N^0.26) at most in average, with a high
probability of a much lower exponent around 0.16 and even as low as 0.1. It is
therefore well adapted for inclusion in larger software and seems like a good
compromise. Worst-case is in O(N^2). Then the paper will focus on differences
between available methods and the brute-force algorithm and a solution is
proposed. Although sub-optimal its applications could mainly be to answer in a
fast way a number of scattered unrelated intersection queries using minimal
complexity and additional resources.

involves use of single epoch spectra with s/n and resolution that permit
accurate measurement of the width of a broad line assumed to be a reliable
virial estimator. Coupled with an estimate of the radius of the broad line
region this yields M_BH. The radius of the broad line region (BLR) may be
inferred from an extrapolation of the correlation between source luminosity and
reverberation derived r_BLR measures (the so-called Kaspi relation involving
about 60 low z sources). We are exploring a different method for estimating
r_BLR directly from inferred physical conditions in the BLR of each source. We
report here on a comparison of r_BLR estimates that come from our method and
from reverberation mapping. Our ""photoionization"" method employs diagnostic
line intensity ratios in the rest-frame range 1400-2000 A
(AlIII1860/SiIII]1892, CIV1549/AlIII1860) that enable derivation of the product
of density and ionization parameter with the BLR distance derived from the
definition of the ionization parameter. We find good agreement between our
estimates of the density, ionization parameter and r_BLR and those from
reverberation mapping. We suggest empirical corrections to improve the
agreement between individual photoionization-derived r_BLR values and those
obtained from reverberation mapping. The results in this paper can be exploited
to estimate M_BH for large samples of high-z quasars using an appropriate
virial broadening estimator. We show that the width of the UV intermediate
emission lines are consistent with the width of H beta, therefore providing a
reliable virial broadening estimator that can be measured in large samples of
high-z quasars.

relies on the UGC, we demonstrate, nevertheless, that the corresponding PCP

""translate"" the integrality gap instance of Unique Games to an integrality gap

The transport anomalies are \emph{dip} and overshoot effects, where the Hall
resistance decreases (or increases) unexpectedly at the quantized resistance
plateaus intervals. We report on our numerical findings of the \emph{dip}
effect in the Hall resistance, considering GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures in
which we investigated the effect under different experimental conditions. We
show that, similar to overshoot, the amplitude of the dip effect is strongly
influenced by the edge reconstruction due to electrostatics. It is observed
that the steep potential variation close to the physical boundaries of the
sample results in narrower incompressible strips, hence, the experimental
observation of the dip effect is limited by the properties of these current
carrying strips. By performing standard Hall resistance measurements on gate
defined narrow samples, we demonstrate that the predictions of the screening
theory is in well agreement with our experimental findings.

triangle, the interference between two paths results in formation of ""beats""
and ""steps"" pattern in the time-dependent transition probability. The
characteristic time scales describing the ""beats"" and ""steps"" depend on a dwell
time through the triangle. These scales are related to the geometric size of
the interferometer. We formulate the SU(3) Landau - Zener problem in terms of
Bloch dynamics of a unit vector and find a solution of eight-dimensional Bloch
equations in the limit of a non-adiabatic transition. Possible experiments in
triangular and linearly arranged triple quantum dots where Landau - Zener
interferometry can be used for finding manifestations of SU(3) symmetry are
discussed.

by a non-thermal population of electrons and positrons in a single homogeneous
emission region, partially upscattered to gamma-rays by the particles
themselves. The model is usually considered as degenerate, given that the
number of free parameters is higher than the number of observables. It is thus
common to model the SED by choosing a single set of values for the SSC-model
parameters that provide a good description of the data, without studying the
entire parameter space. We present here a new numerical algorithm which permits
us to find the complete set of solutions, using the information coming from the
detection in the GeV and TeV energy bands. The algorithm is composed of three
separate steps: we first prepare a grid of simulated SEDs and extract from each
SED the values of the observables; we then parametrize each observable as a
function of the SSC parameters; we finally solve the system for a given set of
observables. We iteratively solve the system to take into account uncertainties
in the values of the observables, producing a family of solutions. We present a
first application of our algorithm to the typical high-frequency-peaked BL Lac

only have period orbits of size at most two as limit sets. The attractor states
are characterized for general graphs and enumerated in the special case of

user (all values in dB scale), then the simple scheme of using point to point
Gaussian codebooks with appropriate power levels at each transmitter and
treating interference as noise at every receiver (in short, TIN scheme)
achieves all points in the capacity region to within a constant gap. The
generalized degrees of freedom (GDoF) region under this condition is a
polyhedron, which is shown to be fully achieved by the same scheme, without the
need for time-sharing. The results are proved by first deriving a polyhedral
relaxation of the GDoF region achieved by TIN, then providing a dual
characterization of this polyhedral region via the use of potential functions,
and finally proving the optimality of this region in the desired regime.

quite different between the two environments. GMCs exist almost exclusively
along HI spiral arms and filaments in the disks of local small galaxies (LMC,

perturbed onto orbits that bring them close to the SMBH. If the star is in a
binary system, the three-body interaction with the SMBH can lead to large
changes in orbital energy, depositing one of the two stars on a tightly-bound
orbit, and its companion into a hyperbolic orbit that may escape the galaxy. In
this Letter, we show that the disruption of solitary stars can also lead to
large positive increases in orbital energy. The kick velocity depends on the
amount of mass the star loses at pericenter, but not on the ratio of black hole
to stellar mass, and are at most the star's own escape velocity. We find that
these kicks are usually too small to result in the ejection of stars from the

reducing their probability of being disrupted again. We estimate that ~10^5

relation given by M_corr = -22.24 - 10.05[log(W_corr) - 2.5], with an average
dispersion of sigma_WISE = 0.686 magnitudes. There is some tension between WISE
TF and a preliminary 3.6-micron relation, which has a shallower slope and
almost no intrinsic dispersion. However, our results agree well with a more
recent relation constructed from a large sample of cluster galaxies. We
additionally compare WISE TF to the near-infrared 2MTF template relations,
finding a good agreement between the TF parameters and total dispersions of
WISE TF and the 2MTF K-band template. This fact, coupled with typical galaxy
colors of (K - W1) ~ 0, suggests that these two bands are tracing similar
stellar populations, including the older, centrally-located stars in the
galactic bulge which can (for galaxies with a prominent bulge) dominate the
light profile.

changes its longitude on timescales of weeks to months. The quasi-periods of

curve amplitude consistent with that inferred from LOS velocity studies. The
implied disk viewing angles agree with the range of values found in the

asymmetric drift. Outside the central region, the circular velocity is

asymptotic results show that by increasing the number of antennas one can
achieve a large array gain and at the same time naturally decorrelate the user

intended destinations without causing much inter-user interference. Since these
results rely on asymptotics, it is important to investigate whether the
conventional system models are still reasonable in the asymptotic regimes. This
paper analyzes the fundamental limits of large-scale multiple-input
single-output (MISO) communication systems using a generalized system model
that accounts for transceiver hardware impairments. As opposed to the case of

on the estimation accuracy and capacity of large-scale MISO systems.
Surprisingly, the performance is only limited by the hardware at the
single-antenna user terminal, while the impact of impairments at the
large-scale array vanishes asymptotically. Furthermore, we show that an
arbitrarily high energy efficiency can be achieved by reducing the power while

effect of rippled shock -- by using three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics

anisotropic velocity dispersion that leads to a selective amplification of the
radial component of the magnetic field. The Richtmyer-Meshkov instability is
induced by the interaction between the shock and upstream density fluctuations.
Future high-resolution polarization observations can distinguish the following
candidates responsible for the upstream density fluctuations: (i) inhomogeneity
caused by the cascade of large-scale turbulence in the ISM so-called the
big-power-law-in-the-sky, (ii) structures generated by the Drury instability in
the cosmic-ray modified shock, and (iii) fluctuations induced by the non-linear

that there are two distinct regimes of [alpha/Fe] versus age which we identify
as the epochs of the thick and thin disk formation. A tight correlation between
metallicity and [alpha/Fe] versus age is clearly identifiable on thick disk
stars, implying that this population formed from a well mixed ISM, over a time
scale of 4-5 Gyr. Thick disk stars vertical velocity dispersion correlate with
age, with the youngest objects having as small scale heights as those of thin
disk stars. A natural consequence of these two results is that a vertical
metallicity gradient is expected in this population. We suggest that the thick
disk set the initial conditions for the formation of the inner thin disk. This
provides also an explanation of the apparent coincidence between the step in
metallicity at 7-10 kpc in the thin disk and the confinment of the thick disk
at about R<10 kpc. We suggest that the outer thin disk developped outside the
influence of the thick disk, but also that the high alpha-enrichment of the
outer regions may originate from a primordial pollution by the gas expelled
from the thick disk. Local metal-poor thin disk stars, whose properties are
best explained by an origin in the outer disk, are shown to be as old as the
youngest thick disk (9-10 Gyr), implying that the outer thin disk started to
form while the thick disk formation was still on-going in the inner Galaxy. We
point out that, given the tight age-abundance relations in the thick disk, an
inside-out process would give rise to a radial gradient in abundances in this
population which is not observed. Finally, we argue that the data discussed
here leave little room for radial migration, either to have contaminated the
solar vicinity, or, to have redistributed stars in significant proportion
across the solar annulus.

the application of a tailored field. The observable value as a function of the
field constitutes a quantum control landscape. Previous works have shown, under
specified conditions, that the quantum control landscape should be free of
suboptimal critical points. This favorable landscape topology is one factor
contributing to the efficiency of climbing the landscape. An additional,
complementary factor is the landscape \textit{structure}, which constitutes all
non-topological features. If the landscape's structure is too complex, then
climbs may be forced to take inefficient convoluted routes to finding optimal
controls. This paper provides a foundation for understanding control landscape
structure by examining the linearity of gradient-based optimization
trajectories through the space of control fields. For this assessment, a metric
$R\geq 1$ is defined as the ratio of the path length of the optimization
trajectory to the Euclidean distance between the initial control field and the
resultant optimal control field that takes an observable from the bottom to the
top of the landscape. Computational analyses for simple model quantum systems
are performed to ascertain the relative abundance of nearly straight control
trajectories encountered when optimizing a state-to-state transition
probability. The collected results indicate that quantum control landscapes
have very simple structural features. The favorable topology and the
complementary simple structure of the control landscape provide a basis for
understanding the generally observed ease of optimizing a state-to-state
transition probability.

initial geometrical fluctuations, and it is the hydrodynamic evolution of the
system that transforms those initial spatial irregularities into final state
momentum anisotropies. Cumulant analysis provides a mathematical tool to
decompose those initial fluctuations in terms of radial and azimuthal
components. It is usually thought that a specified order of azimuthal cumulant,
for the most part, linearly produces flow harmonic of the same order. In this
work, we carry out a systematic study on the connection between cumulants and
flow harmonics using a hydrodynamic code called NeXSPheRIO. We conduct three
types of calculations, by explicitly decomposing the initial conditions into
components corresponding to a given eccentricity and studying the out-coming
flow through hydrodynamic evolution. It is found that for initial conditions
deviating significantly from Gaussian, such as those from NeXuS, the linearity
between eccentricities and flow harmonics partially breaks down. Combining with
the effect of coupling between cumulants of different orders, it causes the
production of extra flow harmonics of higher orders. We argue that these
results can be seen as a natural consequence of the non-linear nature of
hydrodynamics, and they can be understood intuitively in terms of the
peripheral-tube model.

topology of the network can be changed by the nodes in the network. For
example, peer-to-peer, wireless and ad-hoc networks are reconfigurable. More
generally, many social networks, such as a company's organizational chart;
infrastructure networks, such as an airline's transportation network; and
biological networks, such as the human brain, are also reconfigurable. Modern
reconfigurable networks have a complexity unprecedented in the history of
engineering, resembling more a dynamic and evolving living animal rather than a
structure of steel designed from a blueprint. Unfortunately, our mathematical
and algorithmic tools have not yet developed enough to handle this complexity
and fully exploit the flexibility of these networks.
  We believe that it is no longer possible to build networks that are scalable
and never have node failures. Instead, these networks should be able to admit
small, and maybe, periodic failures and still recover like skin heals from a
cut. This process, where the network can recover itself by maintaining key
invariants in response to attack by a powerful adversary is what we call
\emph{self-healing}.
  Here, we present several fast and provably good distributed algorithms for
self-healing in reconfigurable dynamic networks. Each of these algorithms have
different properties, a different set of gaurantees and limitations. We also
discuss future directions and theoretical questions we would like to answer.

interest in analyzing social phenomena. Among the different models of opinion
dynamics, bounded confidence models have been studied in different contexts and
shown interesting dynamics [1-3]. In [E. Kurmyshev, H.A. Ju\'arez, and R.A.

model and studied the self-formation of opinion in heterogeneous societies
composed by agents of two psychological types, concord (C-) and partial
antagonism (PA-) agents. In this work we study the influence of ""leaders"" on
the clustering of opinions. Mixed C/PA-societies along with the pure C- and
PA-society are studied. The influence of the leader's connectivity in the
network, his toughness or tolerance and his opinion on the opinion dynamics is
studied as a function of the initial opinion uncertainty (tolerance) of the
population. Numerical results obtained with leaders at low, high and average
tolerance show complex bifurcation patterns of the group opinion; a decrease or
even the total lost of control of the leader over the society is observed in
different intervals of tolerance of agents in the case of C/PA-societies. We
found that in the C-society a leader showing high opinion tolerance has more
control over the population. In the PA-society a leader changes the bifurcation
pattern of group opinion in a drastic and unexpected way, contrary to the
common sense, and generates stronger polarization in the opposite opinion
groups; the connectivity of the leader is an important factor that usually
improves the adhesion of agents to the leader's opinion. A low tolerance
(authoritarian) leader has greater control over a PA-society than that of a
high tolerance (democratic) one; the opposite result is obtained in the
C-society.

From this study, we make a general formulation of this extended density matrix

found that we can distinguish intrinsic quantum entanglement from the thermal

finite temperatures. Through the above examination, our method using TFD can be
applied not only to equilibrium states but also to non-equilibrium states. This
is shown using some simple finite systems in the present paper.

noise, dispersion, scattering and motion. Large transmitted powers suggest
maximizing power efficiency (ratio of information rate to average signal power)
as opposed to restricting bandwidth. The fundamental limit to reliable
communication is determined, and is not affected by carrier frequency,
dispersion, scattering, or motion. The available efficiency is limited by noise
alone, and the available information rate is limited by noise and available
average power. A set of five design principles (well within our own
technological capability) can asymptotically approach the fundamental limit; no
other civilization can achieve greater efficiency. Bandwidth can be expanded in
a way that avoids invoking impairment by dispersion or scattering. The
resulting power-efficient signals have characteristics very different from
current SETI targets, with wide bandwidth relative to the information rate and
a sparse distribution of energy in both time and frequency. Information-free
beacons achieving the lowest average power consistent with a given receiver
observation time are studied. They need not have wide bandwidth, but do
distribute energy more sparsely in time as average power is reduced. The
discovery of both beacons and information-bearing signals is analyzed, and most
closely resembles approaches that have been employed in optical SETI. No
processing is needed to account for impairments other than noise. A direct
statistical tradeoff between a larger number of observations and a lower
average power (including due to lower information rate) is established. The
""false alarms"" in current searches are characteristic signatures of these
signals. Joint searches for beacons and information-bearing signals require
straightforward modifications to current SETI pattern recognition approaches.

Making use of the recent theory of Jacobians of noncommutative motives, we

Jacobian carrying a principal polarization, we prove that the morphism t
preserves this extra structure. As an application, we obtain categorical

so-called {\it Trugman loop} processes, where the hole goes nearly twice around
closed loops, first creating and then removing wrongly-oriented spins, and
ending up at a different lattice site. This generates effective second- and

very different spectrum than when the quasiparticle and impurity are on the

individual vortices) lead to scaling of typical winding numbers W trapped
inside a loop of circumference C with the square root of C when the expected
winding numbers are large. Such scaling is consistent with the Kibble-Zurek
mechanism (KZM). By contrast, distribution of individual vortices with randomly
assigned topological charges would result in the dispersion of W scaling with
the square root of the area inside C. Scaling of the dispersion of W and of the
probability of detection of non-zero W with C can be also studied for loops so
small that non-zero windings are rare. In this case I show a doubling of the
scaling of dispersion with C when compared to the scaling of dispersion in the
large W regime. Moreover, probability of trapping of a non-zero W becomes, in
this case, proportional to the area subtended by C (hence, to the square of
circumference). This quadruples, as compared with large winding numbers regime,
the exponent in the power law dependence of the frequency of trapping of W=+1
or W=-1 on C. Such change of the power law exponent by a FACTOR OF FOUR implies

players. Each player has a private input, and they communicate by sending
messages to one another over private channels. While this model has been used
extensively in distributed computing and in multiparty computation, lower
bounds on communication complexity in this model and related models have been
somewhat scarce. In recent work \cite{phillips12,woodruff12,woodruff13}, strong
lower bounds of the form $\Omega(n \cdot k)$ were obtained for several
functions in the message-passing model; however, a lower bound on the classical
Set Disjointness problem remained elusive.
  In this paper, we prove tight lower bounds of the form $\Omega(n \cdot k)$
for the Set Disjointness problem in the message passing model. Our bounds are
obtained by developing information complexity tools in the message-passing
model, and then proving an information complexity lower bound for Set
Disjointness. As a corollary, we show a tight lower bound for the task
allocation problem \cite{DruckerKuhnOshman} via a reduction from Set
Disjointness.

Kapovich)","103 pages (including an appendix by Michael Kapovich)",,,,"math.AG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The classical Hermitian eigenvalue problem addresses the following question:
What are the possible eigenvalues of the sum A+B of two Hermitian matrices A
and B, provided we fix the eigenvalues of A and B. A systematic study of this
problem was initiated by H. Weyl (1912). By virtue of contributions from a long
list of mathematicians, notably Weyl (1912), Horn (1962), Klyachko (1998) and
Knutson-Tao (1999), the problem is finally settled. The solution asserts that
the eigenvalues of A+B are given in terms of certain system of linear
inequalities in the eigenvalues of A and B. These inequalities are given
explicitly in terms of certain triples of Schubert classes in the singular
cohomology of Grassmannians and the standard cup product. Belkale (2001) gave
an optimal set of inequalities for the problem in this case. The Hermitian
eigenvalue problem has been extended by Berenstein-Sjamaar (2000) and
Kapovich-Leeb-Millson (2005) for any semisimple complex algebraic group G.
Their solution is again in terms of a system of linear inequalities obtained
from certain triples of Schubert classes in the singular cohomology of the
partial flag varieties G/P (P being a maximal parabolic subgroup) and the
standard cup product. However, their solution is far from being optimal. In a
joint work with P. Belkale, we define a deformation of the cup product in the
cohomology of G/P and use this new product to generate our system of
inequalities which solves the problem for any G optimally (as shown by
Ressayre). This article is a survey (with more or less complete proofs) of this
additive eigenvalue problem.

uncovers a qualitatively new behaviour, which leads us to investigate a novel

features of the emergent quantum geometry in numerical simulations with a
classical minisuperspace formulation, we find partial agreement. By measuring
the correlation matrix of volume fluctuations we succeed in reconstructing the

controller, such as device-to-device communication systems, has created the
need for new problem frameworks to design and analyze the performance of such

paper examines the strategic behavior of \emph{receivers} in a Gaussian
broadcast channel (BC) and \emph{transmitters} in a multiple access channel
(MAC) with sum power constraints (sum power MAC) using the framework of
non-cooperative game theory. These signaling scenarios are modeled as
generalized Nash equilibrium problems (GNEPs) with jointly convex and coupled
constraints and the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium achieving
strategies and equilibrium utilities are characterized for both the Gaussian BC
and the sum power MAC. The relationship between Pareto-optimal boundary points
of the capacity region and the generalized Nash equilibria (GNEs) are derived
for the several special cases and in all these cases it is shown that all the
GNEs are Pareto-optimal, demonstrating that there is no loss in efficiency when
players adopt strategic behavior in these scenarios. Several key equivalence
relations are derived and used to demonstrate a game-theoretic duality between
the Gaussian MAC and the Gaussian BC. This duality allows a parametrized
computation of the equilibria of the BC in terms of the equilibria of the MAC
and paves the way to translate several MAC results to the dual BC scenario.

Inspired by various applications, we focus on the case when the nonsmooth part
is a composition of a proper closed convex function P and a nonzero affine map,
with the proximal mappings of \tau P, \tau > 0, easy to compute. In this case,
a direct application of the widely used proximal gradient algorithm does not
necessarily lead to easy subproblems. In view of this, we propose a new
algorithm, the proximal-proximal gradient algorithm, which admits easy
subproblems. Our algorithm reduces to the proximal gradient algorithm if the
affine map is just the identity map and the stepsizes are suitably chosen, and
it is equivalent to applying a variant of the alternating minimization
algorithm [35] to the dual problem. Moreover, it is closely related to inexact
proximal gradient algorithms [29,33]. We show that the whole sequence generated
from the algorithm converges to an optimal solution. We also establish an upper
bound on iteration complexity. Our numerical experiments on the stochastic
realization problem and the logistic fused lasso problem suggest that the

deterministic textures is virtually non-existent. In nature, especially in
squamata, there are many examples of deterministic structured textures that
allow species to control friction and condition their tribological response for
efficient function. In this work, we draw a comparison between industrial
surfaces and reptilian surfaces. We chose the python regius species as a
bio-analogue with a deterministic surface. We first study the structural make
up of the ventral scales of the snake (both construction and metrology). We
further compare the metrological features of the ventral scales to
experimentally recommended performance indicators of industrial surfaces
extracted from open literature. The results indicate the feasibility of
engineering a Laser Textured Surface based on the reptilian ornamentation
constructs. It is shown that the metrological features, key to efficient
function of a rubbing deterministic surface, are already optimized in the
reptile. We further show that optimization in reptilian surfaces is based on
synchronizing surface form, textures and aspects to condition the frictional
response. Mimicking reptilian surfaces, we argue, may form a design methodology
potentially capable of generating advanced deterministic surface constructs
capable of efficient tribological function.

resolution along the co-evolved F1 dimension and (b) rapid identification of
sequential HSQC peaks on its F2(15N)- F3(1H) planes. The current implementation
is based on the fact that the linear combination of 15N and 13CO/13Ca chemical
shifts offers relatively better dispersion and randomness compared to the
individual chemical shifts; thus enables the assignment of crowded HSQC spectra
by resolving the ambiguities generally encountered in HNCN based assignment
protocol because of amide 15N shift degeneracy. Additionally, each of these
experiments enables assignment of backbone 13CO/13Ca resonances as well.
Overall, the reduced dimensionality tailored HNCN experiments presented here
will be of immense value for various structural and functional proteomics
studies by NMR; particularly of intrinsically or partially/unstructured
proteins and medium sized (MW ~12-15 kDa) folded proteins. The experiments,
like any other experiment that yields protein assignments, would be extremely
valuable for protein folding and drug discovery programs as well.

An analysis of the oscillations above sunspots was carried out using

(SiI 10827A, HeI 10830A, FeI 6173A, 1700A, HeII 304A, FeIX 171A).
  Aims. Investigation of the spatial distribution of oscillation power in the
frequency range 1-8 mHz for the different height levels of the solar
atmosphere. Measuring the time lags between the oscillations at the different
layers.
  Methods. We used frequency filtration of the intensity and Doppler velocity
variations with Morlet wavelet to trace the wave propagation from the
photosphere to the chromosphere and the corona.
  Results. The 15 min oscillations are concentrated near the outer penumbra in
the upper photosphere (1700 A), forming a ring, that expands in the transition
zone. These oscillations propagate upward and reach the corona level, where
their spatial distribution resembles a fan structure. The spatial distribution
of the 5 min oscillation power looks like a circle-shape structure matching the
sunspot umbra border at the photospheric level. The circle expands at the
higher levels (HeII 304A and FeIX 171A). This indicates that the low-frequency
oscillations propagate along the inclined magnetic tubes in the spot. We found
that the inclination of the tubes reaches 50--60 degrees in the upper
chromosphere and the transition zone. The main oscillation power in the 5-8 mHz
range concentrates within the umbra boundaries at all the levels. The highest
frequency oscillations (8 mHz) are located in the peculiar points inside the
umbra. These points probably coincide with umbral dots. We deduced the
propagation velocities to be 28+-15 km/s, 26+-15 km/s, and 55+-10 km/s for the
SiI 10827A-HeI 10830A, 1700A-HeII 304A, and HeII 304A-FeIX 171A height levels,

Known conversions from directed HCP to undirected HCP, and sub-cubic HCP to
cubic HCP are given. We introduce a subgraph called a 4-gate and show that it
may be used to convert sub-quartic HCP into sub-cubic HCP. We further

This result improves upon the previously best known approach which results in
cubic growth in the size of the instance. We further prove that the quadratic
function is reduced to a linear function if the maximum initial degree is
bounded above by a constant. Motivated by this result, we describe an algorithm
to convert general HCP to HCP of bounded degree and prove that it results in
only linear growth. All of the above results are then used in the proof that

deformations of an anisotropic linearly elastic material, as conditions to be
satisfied by the elastic compliances. These conditions make it straightforward
to derive results for incompressible materials from those established for the
compressible materials. As an illustration, the explicit secular equation is
obtained for surface waves in incompressible monoclinic materials with the
symmetry plane at x_3=0. This equation also covers the case of incompressible
orthotropic materials.
  The displacements and stresses for surface waves are often expressed in terms
of the elastic stiffnesses, which can be unbounded in the incompressible limit.
An alternative formalism in terms of the elastic compliances presented recently
by Ting is employed so that surface wave solutions in the incompressible limit
can be obtained. A different formalism, also by Ting, is employed to study the
solutions to two-dimensional elastostatic problems.
  In the special case of incompressible monoclinic material with the symmetry
plane at x_3=0, one of the three Barnett-Lothe tensors S vanishes while the
other two tensors H and L are the inverse of each other. Moreover, H and L are
diagonal with the first two diagonal elements being identical. An interesting
physical phenomenon deduced from this property is that there is no
interpenetration of the interface crack surface in an incompressible

the image force due to a line dislocation in a half-space or in a bimaterial

Redundant data avoidance, congestion control are the important metrics that
affect the performance of wireless sensor network. As many approaches were
proposed to increase the performance of a wireless sensor network among them
clustering is one of the efficient approaches in sensor network. Many
clustering algorithms concentrate mainly on power Optimization like FSCH,
LEACH, and EELBCRP. There is necessity of the above metrics in wireless sensor
network where nodes are densely deployed in a given network area. As the nodes
are deployed densely there is maximum possibility of nodes appear in the
sensing region of other nodes. So there exists an option that nodes have to
send the information that is already reached the base station by its own
cluster members or by members of other clusters. This mechanism will affect the
QoI, Energy factor and congestion control of the wireless sensor networks. Even
though clustering uses TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) for avoiding
congestion control for intra clustering data transmission, but it may fail in
some critical situation. This paper proposed a energy efficient clustering
which avoid data redundancy in a dense sensor network until the network becomes
sparse and hence uses the TDMA efficiently during high density of the nodes.

Fourier transform in the linear circuit model has been a long standing open
problem. All lower bounds so far have made strong restrictions on the
computational model. One of the most well known results, by Morgenstern from
1973, provides an $\Omega(n \log n)$ lower bound for the \emph{unnormalized}
FFT when the constants used in the computation are bounded. The proof uses a
potential function related to a determinant. The determinant of the
unnormalized Fourier transform is $n^{n/2}$, and thus by showing that it can
grow by at most a constant factor after each step yields the result.
  This classic result, however, does not explain why the \emph{normalized}
Fourier transform, which has a unit determinant, should take $\Omega(n\log n)$
steps to compute. In this work we show that in a layered linear circuit model
restricted to unitary $2\times 2$ gates, one obtains an $\Omega(n\log n)$ lower
bound. The well known FFT works in this model. The main argument concluded from
this work is that a potential function that might eventually help proving the
$\Omega(n\log n)$ conjectured lower bound for computation of Fourier transform
is not related to matrix determinant, but rather to a notion of matrix entropy.

the DBMS model with one-way rate-limited public communication, (iii) the 1-to-m

although they may not achieve the secret-key capacity. For models (i), (ii) and

we provide special cases of these models for which no seed is required.
Finally, we show an application of our results to secrecy and privacy for
biometric systems. We thus provide the first examples of low-complexity

promises significant improvements in system throughput and power efficiency. In
effect, a new class of large multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
communication systems has recently emerged and attracted both scientific and
industrial attention. To analyze these systems in realistic scenarios, one has
to include such aspects as co-channel interference, multiple access and spatial
correlation. In this paper, we study the properties of correlated MIMO
multiple-access channels in the presence of external interference. Using the
replica method from statistical physics, we derive the ergodic sum-rate of the
communication for arbitrary signal constellations when the numbers of antennas
at both ends of the channel grow large. Based on these asymptotic expressions,
we also address the problem of sum-rate maximization using statistical channel
information and linear precoding. The numerical results demonstrate that when
the interfering terminals use discrete constellations, the resulting
interference becomes easier to handle compared to Gaussian signals. Thus, it
may be possible to accommodate more interfering transmitter-receiver pairs
within the same area as compared to the case of Gaussian signals. In addition,
we demonstrate numerically for the Gaussian and QPSK signaling schemes that it
is possible to design precoder matrices that significantly improve the
achievable rates at low-to-mid range of signal-to-noise ratios when compared to
isotropic precoding.

this paper, we present a method to attach affinity scores to the implicit
labels of individual points in a clustering. The affinity scores capture the
confidence level of the cluster that claims to ""own"" the point. This method is
very general: it can be used with clusterings derived from Euclidean data,
kernelized data, or even data derived from information spaces. It smoothly
incorporates importance functions on clusters, allowing us to eight different
clusters differently. It is also efficient: assigning an affinity score to a
point depends only polynomially on the number of clusters and is independent of
the number of points in the data. The dimensionality of the underlying space
only appears in preprocessing. We demonstrate the value of our approach with an
experimental study that illustrates the use of these scores in different data
analysis tasks, as well as the efficiency and flexibility of the method. We
also demonstrate useful visualizations of these scores; these might prove
useful within an interactive analytics framework.

theory fails to predict transition in wall-bounded shear ow. The shortcoming of
this modal approach was found 20 years ago and is linked to the
non-orthogonality of the eigenmodes of the linearised problem, de noted by the
Orr Sommerfeld and Squire equations. The associated eigenmodes of this
linearised problem are the normal velocity and the normal vorticity eigenmodes,
which are not dimensionally homogeneous quantities. Thus non-orthogonality
condition between these two families of eigenmodes have not been clearly
demonstrated yet. Using an orthogonal decomposition of solenoidal velocity
fields, a velocity perturbation is expressed as an L2 orthogonal sum of an
OrrSommerfeld velocity field (function of the perturbation normal velocity) and
a Squirevelocity field (function of the perturbation normal vorticity). Using
this decomposition,a variational formulation of the linearised problem is
written, that is equivalent to the Orr Sommerfeld and Squire equations, but
whose eigenmodes consist of two families of velocity eigenmodes (thus
dimensionally homogeneous). We demonstrate that these two sets are
non-orthogonal and linear combination between them can produce large transient
growth. Using this new formulation, the link between optimal mode and
continuous mode transition will also be clari fied, as the role of direct
resonance. Numerical solutions are presented to illustrate the analysis in the
case of thin boundary layers developing between two parallel walls at large
Reynolds number. Characterisations of the destabilizing perturbations will be

librations of Mercury's mantle. These librations have previously been studied
for a planet with two layers: a mantle and a liquid core. Here, we calculate
how the presence of a solid inner core in the liquid outer core influences the
long-period forced librations. Mantle-inner core coupling affects the
long-period libration dynamics mainly by changing the free libration: first, it
lengthens the period of the free libration of the mantle, and second, it adds a
second free libration, closely related to the free gravitational oscillation
between the mantle and inner core. The two free librations have periods between
2.5 and 18 y depending on the internal structure. We show that large amplitude
long-period librations of 10's of arcsec are generated when the period of a
planetary forcing approaches one of the two free libration periods. These
amplitudes are sufficiently large to be detectable by spacecraft measurements
of the libration of Mercury. The amplitudes of the angular velocity of
Mercury's mantle at planetary forcing periods are also amplified by the
resonances, but remain much smaller than the current precision of Earth-based
radar observations unless the period is very close to a free libration period.
The inclusion of mantle-inner core coupling in the rotation model does not
significantly improve the fit to the radar observations. This implies that it
is not yet possible to determine the size of the inner core of Mercury on the
basis of available observations of Mercury's rotation rate. Future observations
of the long-period librations may be used to constrain the interior structure
of Mercury, including the size of its inner core.

The predicted abundance of OI absorbers is in reasonable agreement with
observations. At z=10, roughly 70% of sightlines through atomically-cooled
halos encounter a visible (N_OI > 10^14 cm^-2) column. Reionization ionizes and
removes gas from halos less massive than 10^8.4 M_0, but 20% of sightlines
through more massive halos encounter visible columns even at z=5. The mass
scale of absorber host halos is 10-100 times smaller than the halos of Lyman

ionizing sources more directly. OI absorbers have neutral hydrogen columns of
10^19-10^21 cm^-2, suggesting a close resemblance between objects selected in
OI and HI absorption. Finally, the absorption in the foreground of the z=7.085

at the observed HI column density is enriched enough to violate the upper

(Berkeley, Calif., 1986) (1987) 1528-1577 Amer. Math. Soc.] proposed two
general conjectures about repeated games: the first one is that, in any
two-person zero-sum repeated game, the asymptotic value exists, and the second
one is that, when Player 1 is more informed than Player 2, in the long run
Player 1 is able to guarantee the asymptotic value. We disprove these two
long-standing conjectures by providing an example of a zero-sum repeated game
with public signals and perfect observation of the actions, where the value of
the $\lambda$-discounted game does not converge when $\lambda$ goes to 0. The
aforementioned example involves seven states, two actions and two signals for
each player. Remarkably, players observe the payoffs, and play in turn.

Moving cosmic string loops seed filamentary nonlinear objects. We analytically

show that the brightness temperature reaches 200 mK for a loop whose tension is
about the current upper limit, $G\mu\sim10^{-7}$. We also calculate the angular
power spectrum, assuming scaling in loop distribution. We find that the angular
power spectrum for $G\mu>10^{-8}$ at $z=30$ or $G\mu>10^{-10}$ at $z=20$ can
dominate the spectrum of the primordial density fluctuations. Finally we show
that a future SKA-like observation has the potential to detect the power

measure is reliable reception of at least some data from as many as possible

As a first step for improving reliable reception, and motivated by the recent

transmission interval to group packets from the same meter. We derive the
probability of falsely pairing packets from different senders in the simple
case of no channel errors, and show through simulation and data from an

The pairing is an essential step towards recovery of metering data from as many

horizons never form and therefore the outcome of the collapse is not a black
hole, in the sense that there are no regions causally disconnected from future

critical value, disappear when the matter density approaches an upper bound and
gravity becomes very weak (asymptotic freedom regime), form again after the
bounce as a consequence of the decrease in the matter density, and eventually
disappear when the density becomes too low and the matter is radiated away. The

of why isospin asymmetries have to decrease for large $q^2$ (towards the

(UV) isospin violation due to differences between operators coupling to up and
down quarks, and infrared (IR) isospin violation where a photon is emitted from
the spectator quark and is hence proportional to the difference between the up-
and down-quark charges. These isospin violating processes may be subdivided
into weak annihilation (WA), quark loop spectator scattering (QLSS) and a
chromomagnetic contribution. Furthermore we discuss generic selection rules
based on parity and angular momentum for the $B \to Kll$ transition as well as
specific selection rules valid for WA at leading order in the strong coupling
constant. We clarify that the relation between the $K$ and the longitudinal
part of the $K^*$ only holds for leading twist and for left-handed currents. In
general the $B \to \rho ll$ and $B \to K^*ll$ isospin asymmetries are
structurally different yet the closeness of $\alpha_{\rm CKM}$ to ninety
degrees allows us to construct a (quasi) null test for the SM out of the

this paper, we propose to mine the top-k granular association rules for each

the source coverage which measures the user granule size, the target coverage
which measures the item granule size, and the confidence which measures the
strength of the association. With the confidence measure, rules can be ranked
according to their strength. Then we propose algorithms for training the
recommender and suggesting items to each user. Experimental are undertaken on a
publicly available data set MovieLens. Results indicate that the appropriate
setting of granule can avoid over-fitting and at the same time, help obtaining

rainfall-induced shallow landslides are based on deterministic laws. These
models extend spatially the static stability models adopted in geotechnical
engineering, and adopt an infinite-slope geometry to balance the resisting and
the driving forces acting on the sliding mass. An infiltration model is used to
determine how rainfall changes pore-water conditions, modulating the local
stability/instability conditions. A problem with the operation of the existing
models lays in the difficulty in obtaining accurate values for the several
variables that describe the material properties of the slopes. The problem is
particularly severe when the models are applied over large areas, for which
sufficient information on the geotechnical and hydrological conditions of the
slopes is not generally available. To help solve the problem, we propose a
probabilistic Monte Carlo approach to the distributed modeling of
rainfall-induced shallow landslides. For the purpose, we have modified the
Transient Rainfall Infiltration and Grid-Based Regional Slope-Stability
Analysis (TRIGRS) code. The new code (TRIGRS-P) adopts a probabilistic approach
to compute, on a cell-by-cell basis, transient pore-pressure changes and
related changes in the factor of safety due to rainfall infiltration.
Infiltration is modeled using analytical solutions of partial differential
equations describing one-dimensional vertical flow in isotropic, homogeneous
materials. Both saturated and unsaturated soil conditions can be considered.
TRIGRS-P copes with the natural variability inherent to the mechanical and
hydrological properties of the slope materials by allowing values of the TRIGRS
model input parameters to be sampled randomly from a given probability
distribution. [..]

Cluster and field galaxies are investigated with respect to [OII] and H{\alpha}
equivalent width, SFR and morphological descriptors such as concentration index
and Gini coefficient. We study these cluster galaxy properties as a function of
clustercentric distance and investigate the spatial distribution of various
galaxy types. Applying the DS-test we find a 3rd component (A3921-C) in
addition to the two main subclusters (A3921-A and A3921-B) already known. The
re-determined mass ratio between the main components A and B is approx. 2:1.
Similar to prev. studies of galaxy clusters, we find that a large fraction of
the disk galaxies close to the cluster core show no detectable star formation.
These are likely systems that are quenched due to ram pressure stripping. We
also find quenched spirals at rather large distances of 3 to 4 Mpc from the
cluster core. A3921-C might be a group of galaxies falling onto the main
cluster components. We speculate that the unexpected population of quenched
spirals at large clustercentric radii in A3921-A and A3921-B might be an effect
of the ongoing cluster merger: shocks in the ICM might give raise to enhanced
ram pressure stripping and at least in part be the cause for the quenching of
star formation. These quenched spirals might be an interm. stage in the
morphological transformation of field spirals into cluster S0s.

achieved only by using more available data and making no additional

topological distance between them dictates the existence or absence of such a
threshold. In particular, small-world random networks with a degree
distribution decaying slower than an exponential have a vanishing epidemic
threshold in the thermodynamic limit.

get relations between the lepton mixing elements immediately without explicit

$(c\bar{b})$-quarkonium states together with the color-octet $S$-wave

generate the similar charmonium and bottomnium states via the semi-exclusive

is a Fortran programme written in a PYTHIA-compatible format and is written in

A method to improve the efficiency of generating unweighted events within

etc.).
  We use difference image analysis (DIA) to extract precise light curves in the

known variables and lead to new discoveries. We determine the physical
parameters of the only RR0 star using light curve Fourier decomposition

follow-up observations. Assuming that the SX Phe stars are cluster members and
using the period-luminosity relation for these stars, we estimate their
distances as ~25.2+-1.8 and 26.8+-1.8 kpc, and identify their possible modes of
oscillation. We refine the periods of the two RR Lyrae stars in our field of

exhibits the Blazhko effect. Fourier decomposition of the light curve of the
RR0 star V1 allows us to estimate the metallicity [Fe/H]_ZW-1.68+-0.10 or

support to a special symmetry of the Bremsstrahlung function under the formal
discrete Z_2 symmetry L -> -1-L. In this context, it is the counterpart of the
reciprocity invariance discovered in the past in the spectrum of various gauge
invariant composite operators. The Z_2 symmetry has remarkable consequences in
the scaling limit where L is taken to be large with fixed ratio to the 't Hooft
coupling. This limit organizes in inverse powers of the coupling and resembles
the semiclassical expansion of the dual string theory which is indeed known to
capture the leading classical term. We show that the various higher-order
contributions to the Bremsstrahlung function obey several constraints and, in
particular, the next-to-leading term, formally associated with the string
one-loop correction, is completely determined by the classical contribution.

dual conformal field theory to Gauss-Bonnet gravity by modeling a thin-shell of
dust that interpolates between a pure AdS and a Gauss-Bonnet AdS black brane.
The renormalized geodesic length and minimal area surface, which in the dual
conformal field theory correspond to two-point correlation function and
expectation value of Wilson loop, are investigated respectively as
thermalization probes. The result shows that as the Gauss-Bonnet coefficient
increases, the thermalization time decreases for both the thermalization
probes, which can also be confirmed by studying the motion profile of the
geodesic and minimal area surface. In addition, for both the renormalized
geodesic length and minimal area surface, there is an overlapped region for a
fixed boundary separation, which implies that the Gauss-Bonnet coupling
constant has little effect on the thermalization probes there.

defined by fast spinning and strongly magnetized neutron stars, called pulsars.
Their beamed periodic signals have timing stabilities comparable to atomic

and thermally biased tunnel junction between two ferromagnets with
non-collinear magnetizations. Besides the well-known charge and spin currents
we show that a non-zero spin-quadrupole current flows between the ferromagnets.
This tensor-valued current describes the non-equilibrium transport of
spin-anisotropy relating to both local and non-local multi-particle spin
correlations of the circuit. This quadratic spin-anisotropy, quantified in
terms of the spin-quadrupole moment, is fundamentally a two-electron quantity.
In spin-valves with an embedded quantum dot such currents have been shown to
result in a quadrupole accumulation that affects the measurable quantum dot
spin and charge dynamics. The spin-valve model studied here allows fundamental
questions about spin-quadrupole storage and transport to be worked out in
detail, while ignoring the detection by a quantum dot. This physical
understanding of this particular device is of importance for more complex
devices where spin-quadrupole transport can be detected. We demonstrate that,
as far as storage and transport are concerned, the spin anisotropy is only
partly determined by the spin polarization. In fact, for a thermally biased
spin-valve the charge- and spin-current may vanish, while a pure exchange
spin-quadrupole current remains, which appears as a fundamental consequence of
Pauli's principle. We extend the real-time diagrammatic approach to efficiently
calculate the average of multi-particle spin-observables, in particular the
spin-quadrupole current. Although the paper addresses only leading order and
spin-conserving tunneling we formulate the technique for arbitrary order in an
arbitrary, spin-dependent tunnel coupling in a way that lends itself to
extension to quantum-dot spin-valve structures.

great importance in identifying an asteroid taxonomy. The new availability of
geometric albedo data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE)

WISE geometric albedo for the whole main belt (and the Hungaria and Cybele

undifferentiated parent body, they are expected to be homogeneous in colors and
albedo. The new method is quite effective in determining objects belonging to a
family halo, with low percentages of likely interlopers, and results that are
quite consistent in term of taxonomy and geometric albedo of the halo members.

supported by one laboratory data set alone) have been proposed. We argue herein
that this lack of agreement can largely be traced to electrode effects that
have not been properly taken into account. A series of drainage and imbibition
experiments are considered, in which we find that previously proposed
approaches to remove electrode effects are unlikely to provide adequate
corrections. Instead, we explicitly model the electrode effects together with
classical SP contributions using a flow and transport model. The simulated data
agree overall with the observed SP signals and allow decomposing the different
signal contributions to analyze them separately. By reviewing other published
experimental data, we suggest that most of them include electrode effects that
have not been properly taken into account. Our results suggest that previously
presented SP theory works well when considering the modeling uncertainties
presently associated with electrode effects. Additional work is warranted to
not only develop suitable electrodes for laboratory experiments, but also to
assure that associated electrode effects that appear inevitable in longer-term
experiments are predictable, such that they can be incorporated in the modeling
framework.

quantify the similarity of two or more terms belonging to the same ontology.
Ontology terms may be associated to concepts, for instance in computational

Thus, SSMs may be used to quantify the similarity of genes and proteins
starting from the comparison of the associated annotations. SSMs have been
recently used to compare genes and proteins even on a system level scale. More
recently some works have focused on the building and analysis of Semantic
Similarity Networks (SSNs) i.e. weighted networks in which nodes represents
genes or proteins while weighted edges represent the semantic similarity score
among them. SSNs are quasi-complete networks, thus their analysis presents
different challenges that should be addressed. For instance, the need for the
introduction of reliable thresholds for the elimination of meaningless edges
arises. Nevertheless, the use of global thresholding methods may produce the
elimination of meaningful nodes, while the use of local thresholds may
introduce biases. For these aims, we introduce a novel technique, based on
spectral graph considerations and on a mixed global-local focus. The
effectiveness of our technique is demonstrated by using markov clustering for
the extraction of biological modules. We applied clustering to simplified

particle, such as its mass. However, higher-order contributions to the ideal
fields result in amplitude-dependent frequency-shifts. In turn, these
frequency-shifts need to be understood for estimating systematic experimental
errors, and eventually for correcting them by means of calibrating the
imperfections. The problem of calculating the frequency-shifts caused by small
imperfections of a near-ideal trap yields nicely to perturbation theory,
producing analytic formulas that are easy to evaluate for the relevant
parameters of an experiment. In particular, the frequency-shifts can be
understood on physical rather than purely mathematical grounds by considering
which terms actually drive them. Based on identifying these terms, we derive
general formulas for the first-order frequency-shifts caused by any
perturbation parameter Bn or Cn.

straight and fully overcharged DNA (up to its maximal acceptance by multivalent
counterions) to a circle releases some of the adsorbed (correlated)counterions
but still remains fully overcharged. This phenomenon seems to be inherent to
the minimum energy state of a DNA. By definition, the total electrostatic
potential energy of a macroion-counterion system reaches to its lowest point at
maximal acceptance of overcharging counterions that ensures the most stable
conformation. This intermediate phenomenon of release of cations from DNA
surface due to bending can be taken into account in theoretical modeling of
some ionic concentration dependent physico-chemical aspects of DNA solutions in
strong Coulomb coupling regimes.

their multi-component structure makes them rich astrophysical laboratories. The
accretion of a high mass loss rate red giant wind on to a white dwarf (WD)
makes them promising Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) progenitors. Systematic
surveys for new Galactic symbiotic stars are critical to identify new promising
SNe Ia progenitors (e.g. RS Oph) and to better estimate the total population
size to compare against SNe Ia rates. Central to the latter objective is
building a complete census of symbiotic stars towards the Galactic Bulge. Here
we report on the results of a systematic survey of Halpha emission line stars
covering 35 deg^2. It is distinguished by the combination of deep optical
spectroscopy and long-term lightcurves that improve the certainty of our
classifications. A total of 20 bona-fide symbiotic stars are found (13 S-types,
6 D-types and 1 D'-type), 35% of which show the symbiotic specific
Raman-scattered OVI emission bands, as well as 15 possible symbiotic stars that
require further study (6 S-types and 9 D-types). Lightcurves show a diverse
range of variability including stellar pulsations (semi-regular and Mira),
orbital variations and slow changes due to dust. Orbital periods are determined
for 5 S-types and pulsation periods for 3 D-types. The most significant D-type
found is H1-45 and its carbon Mira with a pulsation period of 408.6 days,
corresponding to a distance of ~6.2+-1.4 kpc and M_K=-8.06+-0.12 mag. If H1-45
belongs to the Galactic Bulge, then it would be the first bona-fide luminous
Galactic Bulge carbon star. The lack of luminous carbon stars in the Bulge is a
longstanding unsolved problem. A possible explanation for H1-45 may be that the
carbon enhancement was accreted from the progenitor of the WD companion. A wide
variety of unusual emission line stars were also identified. (abridged)

recycled millisecond pulsar and a companion of unknown nature. Whilst the low
eccentricity of the system favors a white dwarf companion, an unusual double
neutron star system is also a possibility, and optical observations will be
able to distinguish between these possibilities. In order to allow the absolute
luminosity (or upper limit) of the companion object to be properly calibrated,
we undertook astrometric observations with the Very Long Baseline Array to
constrain the system distance via a measurement of annual geometric parallax.
With these observations, we measure the parallax of the J2222-0137 system to be
3.742 +0.013 -0.016 milliarcseconds, yielding a distance of 267.3 +1.2 -0.9 pc,
and measure the transverse velocity to be 57.1 +0.3 -0.2 km/s. Fixing these
parameters in the pulsar timing model made it possible to obtain a measurement
of Shapiro delay and hence the system inclination, which shows that the system
is nearly edge-on (sin i = 0.9985 +/- 0.0005). Furthermore, we were able to
detect the orbital motion of J2222-0137 in our VLBI observations and measure
the longitude of ascending node. The VLBI astrometry yields the most accurate
distance obtained for a radio pulsar to date, and is furthermore the most
accurate parallax for any radio source obtained at ""low"" radio frequencies
(below ~5 GHz, where the ionosphere dominates the error budget). Using the
astrometric results, we show the companion to J2222-0137 will be easily
detectable in deep optical observations if it is a white dwarf. Finally, we
discuss the implications of this measurement for future ultra-high-precision
astrometry, in particular in support of pulsar timing arrays.

the nature and thermodynamic evolution of the LSB cluster by studying the
physical properties of the hot intracluster medium in A76. Methods: We
conducted two-pointed Suzaku observations of A76 and examined the global gas
properties of the cluster by XIS spectral analysis. We also performed
deprojection analysis of annular spectra and derived radial profiles of gas
temperature, density and entropy out to approximately 850 kpc (~ 0.6 r_200) and
560 kpc (~0.4 r_200) in A76 East and A76 West, respectively. Results: The
measured global temperature and metal abundance are approximately 3.3 keV and
0.24 solar, respectively. From the deprojection analysis, the entropy profile
is found to be flat with respect to radius. The entropy within the central
region (r < 0.2r_200) is exceptionally high (~400 keV cm^2). This phenomenon is
not readily explained by either gravitational heating or preheating. The X-ray
morphology is clumped and irregular, and the electron density is extremely low
(1e-4 -- 1e-3 cm^-3) for the observed high temperature, suggesting that A76 is
in the early phase of cluster formation and the gas compression due to
gravitational potential confinement is lagging behind the gas heating.

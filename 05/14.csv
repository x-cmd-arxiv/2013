transport properties of 3D topological insulator surface states is developed.
We focus on a slab geometry (characteristic for most experiments) and show that
interactions between the top and bottom surfaces are important at not too high
temperatures. We treat the general case of different surfaces (different
carrier densities, uncorrelated disorder, arbitrary dielectric environment,
etc.). In order to access the low-energy behavior of the system we renormalize
the interacting diffusive sigma model in the one loop approximation. It is
shown that intersurface interaction is relevant in the renormalization group
(RG) sense and the case of decoupled surfaces is therefore unstable. An
analysis of the emerging RG flow yields a rather rich behavior. We discuss
realistic experimental scenarios and predict a characteristic non-monotonic
temperature dependence of the conductivity. In the infrared (low-temperature)
limit, the systems flows into a metallic fixed point. At this point, even
initially different surfaces have the same transport properties. Investigating
topological effects, we present a local expression of the $\mathbb Z_2$ theta
term in the sigma model by first deriving the Wess-Zumino-Witten theory for
class DIII by means of non-abelian bosonization and then breaking the symmetry
down to AII. This allows us to study a response of the system to an external
electromagnetic field. Further, we discuss the difference between the system of
Dirac fermions on the top and bottom surfaces of a topological insulator slab
and its non-topological counterpart in a double-well structure with strong
spin-orbit interaction.

group. It appears to be two overlapping families of different asteroid
taxonomies: (44) Nysa is an E-type asteroid with the lowest number in the midst
of a predominantly S-type cluster and (142) Polana is a B-type asteroid near
the low-albedo B- and C-type cluster.
  Using the data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mission we
have re-analyzed the region around the Nysa-Polana complex in the inner Main
Belt, focusing on the low-albedo population. (142) Polana does not appear to be
a member of the family of low-albedo asteroids in the Nysa-Polana complex.
Rather, the largest is asteroid (495) Eulalia. This asteroid has never before
been linked to this complex for an important dynamical reason: it currently has
a proper eccentricity slightly below the range of most of the family members.
However, its orbit is very close to the 3:1 mean motion resonance with Jupiter
and is in a weak secular resonance. We show that its osculating eccentricity
varies widely on short timescales and the averaged value diffuses over long
timescales. The diffusive orbit, low-albedo, taxonomic similarity and semimajor
axis strongly suggests that despite its current proper eccentricity, (495)
Eulalia could have recently been at an orbit very central to the family.
Hierarchical Clustering Method tests confirm that at an eccentricity of e=0.15,
(495) Eulalia could be the parent of the family. The ``Eulalia family'' was
formed between 900--1500 Myr ago, and likely resulted from the breakup of a
100--160 km parent body. There is also compelling evidence for an older and
more widespread primitive family in the same region of the asteroid belt
parented by asteroid (142) Polana.

lanthanide) exhibits a coupled valence and spin-state transition (VSST) at a
temperature T*, which involves two concomitant modifications: (i) a change in
the spin state of Co3+ from low-spin (T < T*) to a higher spin-state (T > T*),
and (ii) a change in the valence state of Pr, from a mixed Pr4+/Pr3+ state (T <
T*) to a purely trivalent state (T > T*), accompanied by an equivalent charge
transfer within the Co3+/Co4+ subsystem. In the present paper, the VSST taking
place in (Pr0.7Sm0.3)0.7Ca0.3CoO3 at T* = about 90 K is investigated by
magnetization and heat capacity measurements. First, we quantitatively
characterized the jumps in magnetic susceptibility (khi) and entropy (S) around
T*. Then, these values were compared to those calculated as a function of the
variations in the population of the different cationic species involved in the
VSST. X-ray absorption spectroscopy experiments recently showed that the higher
spin state above T* should be regarded as an inhomogeneous mixture between
low-spin (LS) and high-spin (HS) states. In the frame of this description, we
demonstrate that the jumps in both khi and S can be associated to the same
change in the Co3+ HS content around T*. This result lends further support to
the relevance of the LS/HS picture for the VSST, challenging the currently
dominant interpretation based on the occurrence of an intermediate-spin (IS)
state of Co3+ above T*.

proposal. Under certain assumptions we use the idea of equivariant localization
to non-rigid backgrounds and show that the path integral of off-shell
supergravity on the near horizon background, which is a circle fibration over
AdS_2xS^2, reduces to a finite dimensional integral over n_V+1 parameters C^A,
where n_V is the number of vector multiplets of the theory while the C^0 mode
corresponds to a normalizable fluctuation of the metric. The localization
solutions, which rely only on off-shell supersymmetry, become after a field
redefinition, the solutions found for localization of supergravity on
AdS_2xS^2. We compute the renormalized action on the localization locus and
show that, in the absence of higher derivative corrections, it agrees with the
four dimensional counterpart computed on AdS_2x S^2. These results together
with possible one-loop contributions can be used to establish an exact
connection between five and four dimensional quantum entropies.

The problem can be informally stated as: how many (not necessarily convex)
windows should we place on the external walls of a dark building, in order to
completely illuminate its interior?
  We consider both closed and open face guards (i.e., faces with or without
their boundary), and we study several classes of polyhedra, including
orthogonal polyhedra, 4-oriented polyhedra, and 2-reflex orthostacks.
  We give upper and lower bounds on the minimum number of faces required to
guard the interior of a given polyhedron in each of these classes, in terms of
the total number of its faces, f. In several cases our bounds are tight: f/6
open face guards for orthogonal polyhedra and 2-reflex orthostacks, and f/4
open face guards for 4-oriented polyhedra. Additionally, for closed face guards
in 2-reflex orthostacks, we give a lower bound of (f+3)/9 and an upper bound of
(f+1)/7.
  Then we show that it is NP-hard to approximate the minimum number of (closed
or open) face guards within a factor of Omega(log f), even for polyhedra that
are orthogonal and simply connected. We also obtain the same hardness results
for polyhedral terrains.
  Along the way we discuss some applications, arguing that face guards are not
a reasonable model for guards patrolling on the surface of a polyhedron.

function (IMF) slope in elliptical galaxies. We use the MILES stellar library
in the wavelength range [3500-7500] {\AA} to select indices that are sensitive
to cool dwarf stars and that only weakly depend on age and metallicity. In this
wavelength range, the response of a change in the effective temperature of the
cool red giant population is similar to the response of a change in the number
of dwarf stars in the galaxy. We investigate the degeneracy between IMF
variation and Teff,RGB and show that it is possible to break it with the new
IMF indicators defined here. In particular, we define a CaH1 index around
{\lambda}6380 {\AA} that arises purely from cool dwarfs, does not strongly
depend on age and is anti-correlated with [a/Fe]. This index allows the
determination of the the IMF slope when combined with TiO lines and age- and
metallicity-dependent features. The use of several indicators is crucial to
break degeneracies between IMF, age, abundance pattern and Teff of the RGB
population. We measure line-index strengths of the optical IMF indicators in
the SSP models and compare these with index strengths of the same features in
stacked SSDSS early-type galaxy spectra with varying velocity dispersions.
Using 10 different indicators, we find a clear trend of a steepening IMF with
increasing velocity dispersion described by the equation
x=(2.3+-0.1)*log{\sigma}200+(2.13+-0.15), where x is the IMF slope and
{\sigma}200 is the central stellar velocity dispersion measured in units of
200km/s. We compute the 'IMF mismatch' parameter as the ratio of stellar
mass-to-light ratio predicted from the x-{\sigma}200 relation to that inferred
from SSP models assuming a Salpeter IMF and find good agreement with

mechanism of seed particle formation for silicate dust in stellar outflows with
an oxygen rich element mixture. Previous results indicated that condensation
temperatures based on this mechanism are significant lower than what is really
observed. This negative result strongly rests on experimental data on vapour
pressure of SiO. New determinations show the older data to be seriously in
error. Here we aim to check with improved data the possibility that SiO
nucleation triggers the cosmic silicate dust formation. First we present
results of our measurements of vapour pressure of solid SiO. Second, we use the
improved vapour pressure data to re-calibrate existing experimental data on SiO
nucleation from the literature. Third, we use the re-calibrated data on SiO
nucleation in a simple model for dust-driven winds to determine the
condensation temperature of silicate in stellar outflows from AGB stars. We
show that onset of nucleation under circumstellar conditions commences at
higher temperature than was previously found. Calculated condensation
temperatures are still by about 100 K lower than observed ones, but this may be
due to the greenhouse effect of silicate dust temperatures. The assumption that
the onset of silicate dust formation in late-type M stars is triggered by
cluster formation of SiO is compatible with dust condensation temperatures
derived from IR observations.

rotating turbulent flow is of great interest. In rotor-stator cavities, the

producing a secondary flow in the meridian plane composed of two thin boundary
layers along the disks separated by a non-viscous geostrophic core. Most
numerical simulations have been performed using RANS and URANS modelling, and
very few investigations have been performed using LES. This paper reports on
quantitative comparisons of two high-order LES methods to predict a turbulent
rotor-stator flow at the rotational Reynolds number Re=400000. The classical
dynamic Smagorinsky model for the subgrid-scale stress (Germano et al., Phys
Fluids A 3(7):1760-1765, 1991) is compared to a spectral vanishing viscosity
technique (S\'everac & Serre, J Comp Phys 226(2):1234-1255, 2007). Numerical
results include both instantaneous data and postprocessed statistics. The
results show that both LES methods are able to accurately describe the unsteady
flow structures and to satisfactorily predict mean velocities as well as
Reynolds stress tensor components. A slight advantage is given to the spectral
SVV approach in terms of accuracy and CPU cost. The strong improvements
obtained in the present results with respect to RANS results confirm that LES
is the appropriate level of modelling for flows in which fully turbulent and
transition regimes are involved.

field is spatially modulated. The change in direction and intensity of the
magnetic field acts as a perturbation that mixes spin projections. This is
exemplified by a ferromagnetic nanowire. There the local field varies smoothly
its direction generating a domain wall (DW) as described by the well-known
Cabrera-Falicov model. Here, we generalize this model to include also a
strength modulation. We identify two striking diabatic regimes that appear when
such magnetic inhogeneity occurs. 1) If the field strength at the DW is weak
enough, the local Zeeman energies result in an avoided crossing. Thus, the
spin-flip probability follows the Landau-Zener formula. 2) For strong fields,
the spin-dependent conductance shows oscillations as a function of the DW
width. We interpret them in terms of Rabi oscillations. Time and length scales
obtained from this simplified view show an excellent agreement with the exact
dynamical solution of the spin-dependent transport. These results remain valid
for other situations involving modulated magnetic structures and thus they open
new prospects for the use of quantum interferences in spin-based devices.

detected in images at 70, 160, 250, 350, and 500 \mu m; 49 Cet is significantly

158 \mu m. The CII line was detected at the 5\sigma\ level - the first
detection of atomic emission from the disk. No other emission lines were seen,
despite the fact that the OI line is the brightest one observed in Herschel
protoplanetary disk spectra (Meeus et al. 2012; Dent et al. 2013). We present

confirms the two-component structure of the disk: warm inner dust and cold
outer dust that produces most of the observed excess. Finally, we discuss
preliminary thermochemical modeling of the 49 Cet gas/dust disk and our

systems, including the Ising and hard-core models, showing that the
computational complexity of approximating the partition function for graphs
with maximum degree D undergoes a phase transition that coincides with the
statistical physics uniqueness/non-uniqueness phase transition on the infinite
D-regular tree. Despite this clear picture for 2-spin systems, there is little
known for multi-spin systems. We present the first analog of the above
inapproximability results for multi-spin systems.
  The main difficulty in previous inapproximability results was analyzing the
behavior of the model on random D-regular bipartite graphs, which served as the
gadget in the reduction. To this end one needs to understand the moments of the
partition function. Our key contribution is connecting: (i) induced matrix
norms, (ii) maxima of the expectation of the partition function, and (iii)
attractive fixed points of the associated tree recursions (belief propagation).
The view through matrix norms allows a simple and generic analysis of the
second moment for any spin system on random D-regular bipartite graphs. This
yields concentration results for any spin system in which one can analyze the
maxima of the first moment. The connection to fixed points of the tree
recursions enables an analysis of the maxima of the first moment for specific
models of interest.
  For k-colorings we prove that for even k, in the tree non-uniqueness region
(which corresponds to k<D) it is NP-hard, unless NP=RP, to approximate the
number of colorings for triangle-free D-regular graphs. Our proof extends to
the antiferromagnetic Potts model, and, in fact, to every antiferromagnetic
model under a mild condition.

unclear. In this paper a proper definition of timescale for long time evolution
is discussed and several numerical results are presented, for different values

preliminary results presented here shows indicates that time scale goes as

are key factors in understanding the performance of non-aqueous Li-air
batteries. Towards revealing these mechanisms, here we use first-principles
calculations to predict the concentrations and mobilities of charge carriers
and intrinsic defects in Li2O2 as a function of cell voltage. Our calculations
reveal that changes in the charge state of O2 dimers controls the defect
chemistry and conductivity of Li2O2. Negative lithium vacancies (missing Li+)
and small hole polarons are identified as the dominant charge carriers. The
electronic conductivity associated with polaron hopping (5 x 10-20 S/cm) is
comparable to the ionic conductivity arising from the migration of Li-ions (4 x
10-19 S/cm), suggesting that charge transport in Li2O2 occurs through a mixture
of ionic and polaronic contributions. These data indicate that the bulk regions
of crystalline Li2O2 are insulating, with appreciable charge transport
occurring only at moderately high charging potentials that drive partial
delithiation. The implications of limited charge transport on discharge and
recharge mechanisms are discussed, and a two-stage charging process linking
charge transport, discharge product morphology, and overpotentials is

efficient charging will depend upon access to alternative mechanisms that
bypass bulk charge transport. More generally, we describe how the presence of a

loading. This is required to simultaneously reproduce the stellar mass content

is implemented assuming an average spectral energy distribution and a
luminosity-dependent scaling of obscuration effects. This form of feedback
suppresses star formation more efficiently than continuous thermal quasar-mode
feedback alone, but is less efficient than mechanical radio-mode feedback in
regulating star formation in massive haloes. We contrast simulation predictions
for different variants of our galaxy formation model with key observations. Our
best match model reproduces, among other things, the cosmic star formation
history, the stellar mass function, the stellar mass - halo mass relation, g-,
r-, i-, z-band SDSS galaxy luminosity functions, and the Tully-Fisher relation.
We can achieve this success only if we invoke very strong forms of stellar and
AGN feedback such that star formation is adequately reduced in both low and
high mass systems. In particular, the strength of radio-mode feedback needs to
be increased significantly compared to previous studies to suppress efficient
cooling in massive, metal-enriched haloes.

data. We measure each cluster's central cooling time, central entropy, and mass
deposition rate, and compare to local cluster samples. We find no significant
evolution from z~0 to z~1 in the distribution of these properties, suggesting
that cooling in cluster cores is stable over long periods of time. We also find
that the average cool core entropy profile in the inner ~100 kpc has not
changed dramatically since z ~ 1, implying that feedback must be providing
nearly constant energy injection to maintain the observed ""entropy floor"" at
~10 keV cm^2. While the cooling properties appear roughly constant over long
periods of time, we observe strong evolution in the gas density profile, with
the normalized central density (rho_0/rho_crit) increasing by an order of
magnitude from z ~ 1 to z ~ 0. When using metrics defined by the inner surface
brightness profile of clusters, we find an apparent lack of classical, cuspy,
cool-core clusters at z > 0.75, consistent with earlier reports for clusters at
z > 0.5 using similar definitions. Our measurements indicate that cool cores
have been steadily growing over the 8 Gyr spanned by our sample, consistent
with a constant, ~150 Msun/yr cooling flow that is unable to cool below
entropies of 10 keV cm^2 and, instead, accumulates in the cluster center. We
estimate that cool cores began to assemble in these massive systems at z ~ 1,
which represents the first constraints on the onset of cooling in galaxy
cluster cores. We investigate several potential biases which could conspire to
mimic this cool core evolution and are unable to find a bias that has a similar
redshift dependence and a substantial amplitude.

to continuously join a zweibein solution on the other side of the singularity

continuous solution is not the choice conventionally made in the previous

wealth of cosmological information, but extracting this information is a
non-trivial task since galaxies and their host haloes are stochastic tracers of
the matter density field. This stochasticity is usually modeled as Poisson shot
noise, which is constant as a function of wavenumber with amplitude given by
1/n, where n is the number density of galaxies. Here we use dark matter haloes
in N-body simulations to show evidence for deviations from this simple
behaviour and develop models that explain the behaviour of the large scale
stochasticity. First, haloes are extended, non-overlapping objects, i.e., their
correlation function needs to go to -1 on small scales. This leads to a
negative correction to the stochasticity relative to the Poisson value at low
wavenumber k, decreasing to zero for wavenumbers large compared to the inverse
exclusion scale. Second, haloes show a non-linear enhancement of clustering
outside the exclusion scale, leading to a positive stochasticity correction.
Both of these effects go to zero for high-k, making the stochasticity scale
dependent even for k<0.1 h/Mpc. We show that the corrections in the low-k
regime are the same in Eulerian and Lagrangian space, but that the transition
scale is pushed to smaller scales for haloes observed at present time, relative
to the initial conditions. These corrections vary with halo mass and redshift.
We also discuss simple applications of these effects to the galaxy samples with
non-vanishing satellite fraction, where the stochasticity can again deviate
strongly from the fiducial Poisson expectation. Overall these effects affect
the clustering of galaxies at a level of a few percent even on very large
scales and need to be modelled properly if we want to extract high precision
cosmological information from the upcoming galaxy surveys.

rethinking of the assumptions underlying the MSSM. Because the large missing
$E_T$ searches are inadequate to detect a LSP decaying within the detector,
R-parity violating supersymmetry is still a good candidate for low energy,
natural supersymmetry. We show that, in Froggatt-Nielsen-like models of
horizontal symmetries, specific textures for the R-parity violating couplings
are dictated by the symmetry, with the largest coupling involving the third
generation fields. Lepton number can be an accidental symmetry of the
renormalizable superpotential and barion number violation is given by a $\bar
u\bar d\bar d$ operator. The collider phenomenology then mimics the main
features of MFV R-parity violating supersymmetry. The LSP can evade current LHC
supersymmetry searches, is allowed to be well below 1 TeV and at the same time
all the constraints from proton decay and other low energy decays can be
satisfied; in particular, dimension five operators allowed by R-parity but
dangerous for the proton are under control, while neutrino masses are generated
by the Weinberg operator. Assuming sub TeV ({\it natural}) superpartners, we
obtain both upper and lower limits on the magnitude of the dominant R-parity
violating coupling: a lower limit of order $10^{-9}$ arises from null LHC
searches on R-hadrons and heavy stable charged particles, while a upper limit
of order $10^{-3}$ follows from constraints on low-energy flavor changing

containing Class 0 protostars: L483, L1157, L1448-IRS2, and Serp-FIR1. This is
the second paper in a larger survey aimed at testing magnetically regulated
models for core-collapse. One key prediction of these models is that the mean
magnetic field in a core should be aligned with the symmetry axis (minor axis)
of the flattened YSO inner envelope (aka pseudodisk). Furthermore, the field
should exhibit a pinched or hour-glass shaped morphology as gravity drags the
field inward towards the central protostar. We combine our results for the four
cores with results for three similar cores that were published in the first
paper from our survey. An analysis of the 350 micron polarization data for the
seven cores yields evidence of a positive correlation between mean field
direction and pseudodisk symmetry axis. Our rough estimate for the probability
of obtaining by pure chance a correlation as strong as the one we found is
about 5%. In addition, we combine together data for multiple cores to create a
source-averaged magnetic field map having improved signal-to-noise ratio, and
this map shows good agreement between mean field direction and pseudodisk axis
(they are within 15 degrees). We also see hints of a magnetic pinch in the
source-averaged map. We conclude that core-scale magnetic fields appear to be
strong enough to guide gas infall, as predicted by the magnetically regulated

properties. However, the link between dust and attenuation is not
straightforward and depends on both the amount of dust and its distribution.
Herschel imaging of nearby galaxies undertaken as part of the KINGFISH project
allows us to map the dust as seen in emission with unprecedented sensitivity
and ~1 kpc resolution. We present here new optical integral field unit
spectroscopy for eight of these galaxies that provides complementary 100-200 pc
scale maps of the dust attenuation through observation of the reddening in both
the Balmer decrement and the stellar continuum. The stellar continuum
reddening, which is systematically less than that observed in the Balmer
decrement, shows no clear correlation with the dust, suggesting that the
distribution of stellar reddening acts as a poor tracer of the overall dust
content. The brightest HII regions are observed to be preferentially located in
dusty regions, and we do find a correlation between the Balmer line reddening
and the dust mass surface density for which we provide an empirical relation.
Some of the high-inclination systems in our sample exhibit high extinction, but
we also find evidence that unresolved variations in the dust distribution on
scales smaller than 500 pc may contribute to the scatter in this relation. We
caution against the use of integrated A_V measures to infer global dust
properties.

by which of these terms are in balance at a given radius - direct accretion is
balanced by star formation and galactic winds near galactic centers, and by
transport at larger radii. We predict that galaxies undergo a smooth transition

literature as object 'B1' (Francis et al. 1996), lies at a redshift where the
main optical emission lines are accessible in the observed near-infrared. We
detect luminous [OIII]4959,5007A and Ha emission with a spatial extent of at
least 32x40 kpc (4""x5""). The dominant optical emission line component shows
relatively broad lines (600-800 km/s, FWHM) and line ratios consistent with
AGN-photoionization. The new evidence for AGN photoionization, combined with
previously detected CIV and luminous, warm infrared emission, suggest that B1
is the site of a hidden quasar. This is confirmed by the fact that [OII] is
relatively weak compared to [OIII] (extinction-corrected [OIII]/[OII] of about
3.8), which is indicative of a high, Seyfert-like ionization parameter. From
the [OIII] luminosity we infer a bolometric AGN luminosity of ~3e46 erg/s, and
further conclude that the obscured AGN may be Compton-thick given existing
X-ray limits. The large line widths observed are consistent with clouds moving
within the narrow line region of a luminous QSO. The AGN scenario is capable of
producing sufficient ionizing photons to power the Lya, even in the presence of
dust. By performing a census of similar objects in the literature, we find that
virtually all luminous LABs harbor obscured quasars. Based on simple duty-cycle
arguments, we conclude that AGN are the main drivers of the Lya in LABs rather
than the gravitational heating and subsequent cooling suggested by cold stream
models. We also conclude that the empirical relation between LABs and overdense
environments at high redshift must be due to a more fundamental correlation
between AGN (or massive galaxies) and environment.

physical processes as possible beyond the standard gravitational and
hydrodynamical physics. Most of this extra physics takes place below the
resolution level of the simulations and is added in a sub-grid fashion.
However, these sub-grid processes affect the macroscopic hydrodynamical
properties of the gas and thus couple to the on-grid physics that is explicitly
integrated during the simulation. In this paper, we focus on the link between
partial ionization and the hydrodynamical equations. We show that the energy
stored in ions and free electrons constitutes a potential energy term which
breaks the linear dependence of the internal energy on temperature. Correctly
taking into account ionization hence requires modifying both the equation of
state and the energy-temperature relation. We implemented these changes in the
cosmological simulation code Gadget2. As an example of the effects of these
changes, we study the propagation of Sedov-Taylor shock waves through an
ionizing medium. This serves as a proxy for the absorption of supernova
feedback energy by the interstellar medium. Depending on the density and
temperature of the surrounding gas, we find that up to 50% of the feedback
energy is spent ionizing the gas rather than heating it. Thus, it can be
expected that properly taking into account ionization effects in galaxy
evolution simulations will drastically reduce the effects of thermal feedback.
To the best of our knowledge, this potential energy term is not used in current
simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.

in which slow-roll inflation is achieved by ""magnetic drift"" as opposed to
Hubble friction. In this work, we give an account of the perturbations at
linear order in this model. Our analysis uncovers two novel phenomena. First,
the amplitude of scalar curvature perturbations is not directly tied to the
shape of the inflationary potential. This allows the theory to violate na\""ive
formulations of the Lyth bound. Second, the tensor sector of the theory is
significantly altered from the usual case: the non-Abelian gauge field
perturbations have a tensor degree of freedom. One chirality of the this tensor
can be exponentially enhanced by a temporary instability near horizon crossing;
this chiral instability exists because of the classical gauge field background,
which violates parity. These tensor fluctuations of the gauge field also couple
to gravitational waves at linear order in perturbation theory and source a
chiral spectrum of gravitational waves. This spectrum can be exponentially
enhanced over the usual inflationary spectrum due to the instability in the
gauge sector. These new features cause the theory in its present form to be in
significant tension with current observational data. This is because the new
scalar physics leads to a significant reddening of the spectral tilt in the
same region of parameter space where the exponential enhancement of the
gravitational wave amplitude is small enough to satisfy current constraints on
the tensor-to-scalar index. Hence, the model either predicts a spectral tilt
that is too red, or it overproduces gravitational waves, or both.

transition amplitudes from the past boundary to the future boundary. To the
extent that we have so far investigated them, these transition amplitudes
appear consistent with the gravitational effective action previously found to
characterize the ground state of quantum spacetime geometry within the
Euclidean de Sitter-like phase. Certain of these transition amplitudes
convincingly demonstrate that the so-called stalks present in this phase are
numerical artifacts of the lattice regularization, seemingly indicate that the
quantization technique of causal dynamical triangulations differs in detail
from that of the no-boundary proposal of Hartle and Hawking, and possibly
represent the first numerical simulations of portions of temporally unbounded

In large networks without edge condensation, the expected temporal dynamics is
a time-rescaled version of the aggregate dynamics. Even for single sequential
realizations, diffusive dynamics is slower in temporal networks. These
discrepancies are due to the noncommutability of interactions. We illustrate

distribution is a generalization, or superset, of the Maxwellian, so they are
able to fit line profiles more precisely than a Gaussian. In most of the data,
the best-fit kappa model produces much lower residuals across the profile than
any single Gaussian and sometimes double Gaussian. Most importantly, the

  corrections to affiliations)",,"10.1088/0004-637X/772/2/135",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the m=1 distortions (lopsidedness) in the stellar components of 167
nearby galaxies that span a wide range of morphologies and luminosities. We
confirm the previous findings of 1) a high incidence of lopsidedness in the
stellar distributions, 2) increasing lopsidedness as a function of radius out
to at least 3.5 exponential scale lengths, and 3) greater lopsidedness, over
these radii, for galaxies of later type and lower surface brightness.
Additionally, the magnitude of the lopsidedness 1) correlates with the
character of the spiral arms (stronger arm patterns occur in galaxies with less
lopsidedness), 2) is not correlated with the presence or absence of a bar, or
the strength of the bar when one is present, 3) is inversely correlated to the
stellar mass fraction, f_*, within one radial scale length, and 4) correlates
directly with f_* measured within the radial range over which we measure
lopsidedness. We interpret these findings to mean that lopsidedness is a
generic feature of galaxies and does not, generally, depend on a rare event,
such as a direct accretion of a satellite galaxy onto the disk of the parent
galaxy. While lopsidedness may be caused by several phenomena, moderate
lopsidedness (<A_1>_i + <A_1>_o)/2 < 0.3) is likely to reflect halo asymmetries
to which the disk responds or a gravitationally self-generated mode . We
hypothesize that the magnitude of the stellar response depends both on how
centrally concentrated the stars are with respect to the dark matter and
whether there are enough stars in the region of the lopsidedness that
self-gravity is dynamically important.

ilk) represent the most extreme sites of star-formation in the distant universe
and contribute significantly to overall cosmic star-formation beyond z>1.5.
Some stars formed in these environments may also explode as GRBs and contribute
to the population of ""dark"" bursts. Here we present VLA wideband
radio-continuum observations of 15 heavily dust-obscured Swift GRBs to search
for radio synchrotron emission associated with intense star-formation in their
host galaxies. Most of these targets (11) are not detected. Of the remaining
four objects, one detection is marginal and for two others we cannot yet rule
out the contribution of a long-lived radio afterglow. The final detection is
secure, but indicates a star-formation rate roughly consistent with the
UV-inferred value. Most galaxies hosting obscured GRBs are therefore not
forming stars at extreme rates, and the amount of optical extinction seen along
a GRB afterglow sightline does not clearly correlate with the likelihood that
the host has a sufficiently high star-formation rate to be radio-detectable.
While some submillimeter galaxies do readily produce GRBs, these GRBs are often
not heavily obscured - suggesting that the outer (modestly obscured) parts of
these galaxies overproduce GRBs and the inner (heavily obscured) parts
underproduce GRBs relative to their respective contributions to star-formation,
hinting at strong chemical or IMF gradients within these systems.

literature, as well as measured from HI data, we present a method for
classifying disk galaxies by their kinematics. In order to investigate
fundamental kinematic properties we concentrate on non-interacting spiral
galaxies. We employ a simple parameterized form for the rotation curve in order
to derive the three parameters: the maximum rotational velocity, the turnover
radius and a measure of the slope of the rotation curve beyond the turnover
radius. Our approach uses the statistical Hierarchical Clustering method to
guide our division of the resultant 3D distribution of galaxies into five
classes. Comparing the kinematic classes in this preliminary classification
scheme to a number of galaxy properties we find that our class containing
galaxies with the largest rotational velocities has a mean morphological type
of Sb/Sbc while the other classes tend to later types. Other trends also
generally agree with those described by previous researchers. In particular we
confirm correlations between increasing maximum rotational velocity and the
following observed properties: increasing brightness in B-band, increasing size
of the optical disk (D_25) and increasing star formation rate (as derived using
radio continuum data). Our analysis also suggests that lower velocities are
associated with a higher ratio of the HI mass over the dynamical mass.
Additionally, three galaxies exhibit a drop in rotational velocity amplitude of
>~ 20% after the turnover radius. However recent investigations suggest that
they have interacted with minor companions which is a common cause for
declining rotation curves. (Figures 12, 14, 16 and 17 are interactive in the

dynamical M_BH measurements, we update sigma for 28 galaxies using homogeneous
H-band measurements that are corrected for galaxy rotation. For active
galaxies, we collect 25 reverberation-mapped AGNs and improve sigma measurement
for two objects . Combining the two samples, we determine the virial factor
$f$, first by scaling the active galaxy sample to the M-sigma relation of
quiescent galaxies, and second by simultaneously fitting the quiescent and
active galaxy samples, as f=5.1_{-1.1}^{+1.5} and f=5.9_{-1.5}^{+2.1},
respectively. The M-sigma relation of active galaxies appears to be shallower
than that of quiescent galaxies. However, the discrepancy is caused by a
difference in the accessible M_BH distribution at given sigma, primarily due to
the difficulty of measuring reliable stellar velocity dispersion for the host
galaxies of luminous AGNs. Accounting for the selection effects, we find that
active and quiescent galaxies are consistent with following intrinsically the
same M-sigma relation.

elastic cross-sections as a function of energy is presented. The dataset
comprises pp and \bar{p}p scattering in the c.m energy interval 5 GeV-8 TeV.
The parametrization for the total cross-section at low and intermediate
energies follows the usual reggeonic structure (non-degenerate trajectories).
For the leading high-energy pomeron contribution, we consider three distinct
analytic parametrizations: either a power (P) law, or a log-squared (L2) law or
a log-raised-to-gamma (Lgamma) law, where the exponent gamma is treated as a
real free fit parameter. The parametrizations are also extended to fit the
elastic (integrated) cross-section data in the same energy interval. Our main
conclusions are the following: the data reductions with the logarithmic laws
show strong dependence on the unknown energy scale involved, which is treated
here either as a free parameter or fixed at the energy threshold; the fit
results with the P law, the L2 law (free scale) and the Lgamma law (fixed scale
and exponent gamma above 2) are all consistent within their uncertainties and
with the experimental data up to 7 TeV, but they partially underestimate the
high-precision TOTEM measurement at 8 TeV; once compared with these results,
the L2 law with fixed scale is less consistent with the data and, in the case
of a free scale, this pomeron contribution decreases as the energy increases
below the scale factor (which lies above the energy cutoff); in all cases
investigated, the predictions for the asymptotic ratio between the elastic and
total cross-sections, within the uncertainties, do not exceed the value 0.430
(therefore, below the black-disc limit) and the results favor rational limits
between 1/3 and 2/5. We are led to conclude that the rise of the hadronic
cross-sections at the highest energies still constitutes an open problem.

(EoE) framework is introduced, to efficiently combine the outputs of various
methods. The proposed framework offers a new selection process of the
binarization methods, which are actually the experts in the ensemble, by
introducing three concepts: confidentness, endorsement and schools of experts.
The framework, which is highly objective, is built based on two general
principles: (i) consolidation of saturated opinions and (ii) identification of
schools of experts. After building the endorsement graph of the ensemble for an
input document image based on the confidentness of the experts, the saturated
opinions are consolidated, and then the schools of experts are identified by
thresholding the consolidated endorsement graph. A variation of the framework,
in which no selection is made, is also introduced that combines the outputs of
all experts using endorsement-dependent weights. The EoE framework is evaluated
on the set of participating methods in the H-DIBCO'12 contest and also on an
ensemble generated from various instances of grid-based Sauvola method with
promising performance.

the WIMP and the charged messengers. While strong coupling by itself is not a

We also discuss more generally the effects of these form-factors on signals in

in colliders. In particular, for low masses of the charged messengers the
production rate at the LHC enjoys an enhancement from the threshold singularity

model, the collision of a single molecular cloud with a circum-nuclear gas disk
(similar to the one observed presently) leads to multiple streams of gas
flowing towards the black hole and creating accretion disks with angular
momentum depending on the ratio of cloud and circum-nuclear disk material. The
infalling gas creates two inclined, counter-rotating sub-parsec scale accretion
disks around the supermassive black hole with the first disk forming roughly 1
Myr earlier, allowing it to fragment into stars and get dispersed before the
second, counter-rotating disk forms. Fragmentation of the second disk would
lead to the two inclined, counter-rotating stellar disks which are observed at
the Galactic Center. A similar event might be happening again right now at the
Milky Way Galactic Center. Our model predicts that the collision event
generates spiral-like filaments of gas, feeding the Galactic Center prior to
disk formation with a geometry and inflow pattern that is in agreement with the
structure of the so called mini-spiral that has been detected in the Galactic
Center.

Inspired by the experimental observation of a Hopf bifurcation in a

substantially richer set of dynamical behaviors, including both local and
global oscillations. Prompted by the observation of relaxation oscillations in
the reverse metabolator, we study the role that a separation of genetic and

a local level. In addition, we consider supervised functional classification
problems, focusing on cases in which the differences between groups are not
extremely clear-cut or the data may contain outlying curves. We perform
classification by means of some available robust methods that involve the use
of a given functional depth, including FSD and KFSD, among others. We use the
functional \textit{k}-nearest neighbor classifier as a benchmark procedure. The
results of a simulation study indicate that the KFSD-based classification
approach leads to good results. Finally, we consider two real classification
problems, obtaining results that are consistent with the findings observed with
simulated curves.

to suppress cooling flows predicted in hot gas in elliptical galaxies, galaxy
groups and clusters. Previous studies have focused on if and how AGN feedback
heats the gas, but little paid attention to its triggering mechanism. Using
spherically symmetric simulations, we investigate how large-scale cooling flows
are accreted by central supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in eight well-observed
systems and find an interesting dichotomy. In massive clusters, the gas
develops a central cooling catastrophe within about the cooling time (typically
~ 100 - 300 Myr), resulting in a cold-mode accretion onto SMBHs. However, in
our four simulated systems on group and galaxy scales at a low metallicity
Z=0.3Z_{sun}, the gas quickly settles into a long-term state which has a cuspy
central temperature profile extending to several tens to about 100 pc. At the
more realistic solar metallicity, two groups (with R_{e} ~ 4 kpc) still host
the long-term hot-mode accretion. Both accretion modes naturally appear in our
idealized calculations where only cooling, gas inflow, and compressional
heating are considered. The long-term hot-mode accretion is maintained by the
quickly-established closeness between the timescales of these processes,
preferably in systems with low gas densities, low gas metallicities, and
importantly, compact central galaxies, which result in strong gravitational
acceleration and compressional heating at the intermediate radii. Our
calculations predict that central cuspy temperature profiles appear more often
in smaller systems than galaxy clusters, which instead often host significant
cold gas and star formation.

coronae of hot plasma that may contain a significant fraction of the so-called
missing baryons. We investigate whether the local (|vLSR|<400 km/s) warm-hot
absorption features observed towards extra-Galactic sources or halo stars are
consistent with being produced by the cooling of the Milky Way's corona. In our
scheme, cooling occurs at the interface between the disc and the corona and it
is triggered by positive supernova feedback. We combine hydrodynamical
simulations with a dynamical 3D model of the galactic fountain to predict the
all-sky distribution of this cooling material, and we compare it with the
observed distribution of detections for different `warm' (SiIII, SiIV, CII,
CIV) and `hot' (OVI) ionised species. The model reproduces the
position-velocity distribution and the column densities of the vast majority of
warm absorbers and about half of OVI absorbers. We conclude that the warm-hot
gas responsible for most of the detections lies within a few kiloparsecs from
the Galactic plane, where high-metallicity material from the disc mixes
efficiently with the hot corona. This process provides an accretion of a few
Mo/yr of fresh gas that can easily feed the star formation in the disc of the
Galaxy. The remaining OVI detections are likely to be a different population of
absorbers, located in the outskirts of the Galactic corona and/or in the
circumgalactic medium of nearby galaxies.

matrix that performs dimensionality reduction and a reduced-rank filter that
produces the output. In the proposed receiver, the transformation matrix and
the reduced-rank filter are updated jointly and iteratively to minimize the
constant modulus (CM) cost function subject to a constraint. Adaptive
implementations for the JIO receiver are developed by using the normalized
stochastic gradient (NSG) and recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithms. In
order to obtain a low-complexity scheme, the columns of the transformation
matrix with the RLS algorithm are updated individually. Blind channel
estimation algorithms for both versions (NSG and RLS) are implemented. Assuming
the perfect timing, the JIO receiver only requires the spreading code of the
desired user and the received data. Simulation results show that both versions
of the proposed JIO receivers have excellent performance in suppressing the
inter-symbol interference (ISI) and multiple access interference (MAI) with a

parameters. The rule stipulates that if N order parameters are such that their
cyclic products equal +1 or -1 then the presence of any N-1 of them will
necessarily induce the missing order parameter as a hidden order. We
demonstrate that the rule results from general microscopic mean field theory
and is thus universally valid. Of exceptional physical interest are the cases
N=4 called quartets, and all N>4 cases decompose into overlaping quartets which
are the building blocks of observable patterns of condensates. Quartets may be
found in two regimes, the ""hierarchy"" regime and the ""equity"" regime, and

A dilemma on whether to cooperate or Defect. Defection by a buyer to seller
and/or seller to buyer might give each a better profit at the cost of the loss
of other. However, if these parties were to interact in future too, a bad past
reference might prevent cooperative actions, thus depriving each other from a
better gain. The anonymity of the players and an absence of central governing
body still make this environment tempting for the defectors. What might be the
evolutionary behavior of defectors in such environment? How could their
increasing population be controlled? It is these two questions basically that
we attempt to address in this research work. A genetic algorithm based spatial
iterated prisoners dilemma (SIPD) environment has been used to simulate the
experiments. A case where compensation for the looser is provided by the system
is modeled and analyzed through experiments. Our results show that compensation
can be useful in decreasing defective population in the society, however, this
might not be enough for the evolution of a cooperative and reliable society of
trustworthy players.

models, but in many cases they pose a challenging problem: how to estimate the
gradient of a loss function with respect to the input of such stochastic
neurons, i.e., can we ""back-propagate"" through these stochastic neurons? We
examine this question, existing approaches, and present two novel families of
solutions, applicable in different settings. In particular, it is demonstrated
that a simple biologically plausible formula gives rise to an an unbiased (but
noisy) estimator of the gradient with respect to a binary stochastic neuron
firing probability. Unlike other estimators which view the noise as a small
perturbation in order to estimate gradients by finite differences, this
estimator is unbiased even without assuming that the stochastic perturbation is
small. This estimator is also interesting because it can be applied in very
general settings which do not allow gradient back-propagation, including the
estimation of the gradient with respect to future rewards, as required in
reinforcement learning setups. We also propose an approach to approximating
this unbiased but high-variance estimator by learning to predict it using a
biased estimator. The second approach we propose assumes that an estimator of
the gradient can be back-propagated and it provides an unbiased estimator of
the gradient, but can only work with non-linearities unlike the hard threshold,
but like the rectifier, that are not flat for all of their range. This is
similar to traditional sigmoidal units but has the advantage that for many
inputs, a hard decision (e.g., a 0 output) can be produced, which would be
convenient for conditional computation and achieving sparse representations and
sparse gradients.

spectrum of each galaxy in the sample is fitted by the full spectrum fitting

higher S/Ns, the ages of stellar populations obtained from ULySS are slightly
older than that from STARLIGHT, and metallicities derived from ULySS are
slightly richer than that from STARLIGHT. In general, both packages can give
roughly consistent fitting results. (2) for low S/N spectra, it is possible
that the fitting by ULySS can be trapped some local minimum parametric regions
during execution and thus may give unreliable results, while STARLIGHT can
still give reliable results. Based on the fitting results of LRGs, we further
analyse their star formation history (SFH) and the relation between their age

networks. The Shannon's sampling theorem states that to recover a signal, the
sampling rate must be as least the Nyquist rate. Compressed sensing (CS) is
based on the surprising fact that to recover a signal that is sparse in certain
representations, one can sample at the rate far below the Nyquist rate. Since
its inception in 2006, CS attracted much interest in the research community and
found wide-ranging applications from astronomy, biology, communications, image
and video processing, medicine, to radar. CS also found successful applications
in communications networks. CS was applied in the detection and estimation of
wireless signals, source coding, multi-access channels, data collection in
sensor networks, and network monitoring, etc. In many cases, CS was shown to
bring performance gains on the order of 10X. We believe this is just the
beginning of CS applications in communications networks, and the future will
see even more fruitful applications of CS in our field.

Herschel 36, the star illuminating the bright Hourglass region of the H II
region Messier 8. Interstellar absorption from excited CH+ in the J=1 level and
from excited CH in the J=3/2 level is also seen. To our knowledge, neither
those excited molecular lines nor such strongly extended DIBs have previously
been seen in absorption from interstellar gas. These unusual features appear to
arise in a small region near Herschel 36 which contains most of the neutral
interstellar material in the sight line. The CH+ and CH in that region are
radiatively excited by strong far-IR radiation from the adjacent infrared
source Her 36 SE. Similarly, the broadening of the DIBs toward Herschel 36 may
be due to radiative pumping of closely spaced high-J rotational levels of
relatively small, polar carrier molecules. If this picture of excited
rotational states for the DIB carriers is correct and applicable to most DIBs,
the 2.7 degree cosmic microwave background may set the minimum widths (about
0.35 A) of known DIBs, with molecular processes and/or local radiation fields
producing the larger widths found for the broader DIBs. Despite the intense
local UV radiation field within the cluster NGC 6530, no previously undetected
DIBs stronger than 10 mA in equivalent width are found in the optical spectrum
of Herschel 36, suggesting that neither dissociation nor ionization of the
carriers of the known DIBs by this intense field creates new carriers with
easily detectable DIB-like features. Possibly related profile anomalies for
several other DIBs are noted.

since the conversions occur rarely and the occurrence feedback is normally

tries to select high quality impressions and adjust the bid price based on the
prior performance distribution in an adaptive manner by distributing the budget

reachability for better performance. This trade-off between reachability and
performance illustrates a need for a forecasting system that can quickly
predict/estimate (with good accuracy) this trade-off. Designing such a system
is challenging due to (a) the huge amount of data to process, and, (b) the need
for fast and accurate estimates. In this paper, we propose a distributed fault
tolerant system that can generate such estimates fast with good accuracy. The
main idea is to keep a small representative sample in memory across multiple

The key challenge is to find the best strata across the past data, perform
multivariate stratified sampling while ensuring fuzzy fall-back to cover the

for injection of a pure spin current from a ferromagnet (FM) into a

believed that this pumping proceeds exclusively via a short-range exchange
interaction at the FM/NM interface. Here we report robust, long-range spin
pumping from the ferrimagnetic double perovskite Sr2FeMoO6 (SFMO) into Pt
across an insulating barrier up to 200 nm thick, and systematically rule out
all known spurious effects. This result demonstrates dynamic spin injection
over a distance far beyond the coupling range of the exchange interaction,
exposing the need to consider other coupling mechanisms. The characteristic
length scale for magnetic textures in Sr2FeMoO6 is approximately 150 nm,
resulting from structural antiphase boundaries, thus raising the possibility
that magnetic dipole coupling underlies the observed long range spin transfer.
This discovery reveals a route to dynamic angular momentum transfer between a
FM and a NM in the absence of mediation by itinerant electrons and promises new
spin-functional devices employing long-range spin pumping.

Suzaku and Chandra observations out to the virial radius report in several

Moreover, the gas mass fraction appears to be inconsistent with the cosmic
value measured from the CMB. Such findings can be interpreted as an evidence
for an additional nonthermal pressure in the outskirts of these clusters. This
nonthermal component may be due to turbulence stirred by residual bulk motions
of extragalactic gas infalling into the cluster. Here we present a SuperModel
analysis of Abell 1835 observed by Chandra out to the virial radius. The
SuperModel formalism can include in the equilibrium a nonthermal component
whose level and distribution are derived imposing that the gas mass fraction
f_{gas} equals the cosmic value at the virial radius. Including such a
nonthermal component, we reconstruct from X rays an increasing mass profile
consistent with the hydrostatic equilibrium also in the cluster outskirts and

magnetic flux in the shallow convection zone of the Sun, and show estimates of
the emerging speed and its decelerating nature. In order to evaluate the speed
of subsurface flux that creates an active region, we apply six Fourier filters
to the Doppler data of NOAA AR 10488, observed with SOHO/MDI, to detect the
reduction of acoustic power at six different depths from -15 to -2 Mm. All the
filtered acoustic powers show reductions, up to 2 hours before the magnetic
flux first appears at the visible surface. The start times of these reductions
show a rising trend with a gradual deceleration. The obtained velocity is first
several km s^-1 in a depth range of 15--10 Mm, then ~1.5 km s^-1 at 10-5 Mm,
finally ~0.5 km s^-1 at 5-2 Mm. If we assume that the power reduction is
actually caused by the magnetic field, the velocity of order of 1 km s^-1 is
well in accordance with previous observations and numerical studies. Moreover,
the gradual deceleration strongly supports the theoretical model that the
emerging flux slows down in the uppermost convection zone before it expands
into the atmosphere to build an active region.

usual problems of massive gravity theories (fatal ghosts instabilities,

action proposed in the context of the degravitation idea. We show that it is

describes the five degrees of freedom of a massive graviton plus a scalar
ghost. However, contrary to generic non-linear extensions of Fierz-Pauli
massive gravity, the ghost has the same mass m as the massive graviton,
independently of the background, and smoothly goes into a non-radiative degree
of freedom for m-> 0. As a consequence, for $m\sim H_0$ the vacuum instability
induced by the ghost is irrelevant even over cosmological time-scales. We
finally show that an extension of the model degravitates a vacuum energy
density of order $M_{Planck}^4$ down to a value of order $M_{Planck}^2 m^2$,
which for $m \sim H_0$ is of order of the observed value of the vacuum energy
density.

this paper, we propose PPB (Phase-Priority Based) cache coherence protocol, an
optimization of modern directory coherence protocol. We take advantage of the
observation that transient states occur in directory coherence protocol,
resulting in some unnecessary transient states and stalling. PPB cache
coherence protocol decouples a coherence transaction and introduces the idea of
phase message. This phase is considered as the priority of the message.
Additionally, we also add new priority-based arbitrators in on-chip network to
support PPB cache coherence protocol. This mechanism in on-chip network can
support effective cache access, which makes the on-chip network more efficient.
Our analysis on an execution-driven full system simulator using SPLASH-2

k-inflation models can be tightly constrained by adding the bounds from the
scalar non-Gaussianities. The small-field inflationary models with asymptotic
flat Einstein-frame potentials in the regime phi >> M_{pl} generally fit the
data very well. These include the models such as Kahler-moduli inflation,
non-minimally coupled Higgs inflation, and inflation in Brans-Dicke theories in
the presence of the potential V(phi)=3M^2 (phi-M_{pl})^2/4 with the Brans-Dicke

to gold electrodes using first-principles calculations. We find excellent
agreement with experiments for both molecules when exchange-correlation effects
are described by the many-body GW approximation. In contrast, results from
standard density functional theory (DFT) deviate from experiments by up to two
orders of magnitude. The failure of DFT is particularly pronounced for the
n-type BDCN junction due to the severe underestimation of the lowest unoccupied

correcting the molecular energy levels for self-interaction errors and image
charge effects. Finally, we show that the conductance and thermopower of the

synchronous temporal oscillations of all Stokes parameters of an initially
linearly or circularly polarized, spectrally broad optical pulse of 150 fs
duration propagating through the crystal. Strong dispersion for photon energies
close to the exciton resonance leads to stretching of the optical pulse to a
duration of 200$-$300 ps and enhancement of magneto-optical effects such as the
Faraday rotation and the non-reciprocal birefringence. The oscillation
frequency of the exciton-polariton polarization increases with magnetic field
$B$, reaching 10 GHz at $B\sim 5$T. Surprisingly, the relative contributions of
Faraday rotation and non-reciprocal birefringence undergo strong changes with
photon energy, which is attributed to a non-trivial spectral dependence of
Faraday rotation in the vicinity of the exciton resonance. This leads to
polarization nutation of the transmitted optical pulse in the time domain. The
results are well explained by a model that accounts for Faraday rotation and
magneto-spatial dispersion in zinc-blende crystals. We evaluate the exciton
$g$-factor $|g_{\rm exc}|=0.2$ and the magneto-spatial constant $V= 5 \times

beamforming to establish network coding on-the-fly at the relay in the uplink,

min{2M_2+2M_3,M_1+M_2+M_3,2N} DoF, where M_j and N represent the number of
antennas at user j and the relay, respectively. Thus, in the extreme case where

the same DoF as the MAC between the 3 users and the relay. In this case, a
decode and forward strategy is optimal. In the other extreme where 2N

(Non)linearity and modal properties in the low- and mid- frequency ranges,
Journal of Sound and Vibration 332 (5) (2013) 1288-1305]. The apparent modal
density of the soundboard of an upright piano in playing condition, as seen
from various points of the structure, exhibits two well-separated regimes,
below and above a frequency flim that is determined by the wood characteristics
and by the distance between ribs. Above flim, most modes appear to be
localised, presumably due to the irregularity of the spacing and height of the
ribs. The low-frequency regime is predicted by a model which consists of
coupled sub-structures: the two ribbed areas split by the main bridge and, in
most cases, one or two so-called cut-off corners. In order to assess the
dynamical properties of each of the subplates (considered here as homogeneous
plates), we propose a derivation of the (low-frequency) modal density of an
orthotropic homogeneous plate which accounts for the boundary conditions on an
arbitrary geometry. Above flim, the soundboard, as seen from a given excitation
point, is modelled as a set of three structural wave-guides, namely the three
inter-rib spacings surrounding the excitation point. Based on these low- and
high-frequency models, computations of the point-mobility and of the apparent
modal densities seen at several excitation points match published measurements.
The dispersion curve of the wave-guide model displays an acoustical radiation
scheme which differs significantly from that of a thin homogeneous plate. It
appears that piano dimensioning is such that the subsonic regime of acoustical
radiation extends over a much wider frequency range than it would be for a
homogeneous plate with the same low-frequency vibration. One problem in piano
manufacturing is examined in relationship with the possible radiation schemes
induced by the models.

patterns in the pattern mining literatures, where most works deal with
databases holding a number of graph transactions, e.g., chemical structures of
compounds. These methods rely heavily on the downward-closure property (DCP) of
the support measure to ensure an efficient pruning of the candidate patterns.
When switching to the emerging scenario of single-graph databases such as
Google Knowledge Graph and Facebook social graph, the traditional support
measure turns out to be trivial (either 0 or 1). However, to the best of our
knowledge, all attempts to redefine a single-graph support resulted in measures
that either lose DCP, or are no longer semantically intuitive.
  This paper targets mining patterns in the single-graph setting. We resolve
the ""DCP-intuitiveness"" dilemma by shifting the mining target from frequent
subgraphs to frequent neighborhoods. A neighborhood is a specific topological
pattern where a vertex is embedded, and the pattern is frequent if it is shared
by a large portion (above a given threshold) of vertices. We show that the new
patterns not only maintain DCP, but also have equally significant semantics as
subgraph patterns. Experiments on real-life datasets display the feasibility of
our algorithms on relatively large graphs, as well as the capability of mining
interesting knowledge that is not discovered in prior works.

by calculating a specific example. This is to be regarded as work in progress.
  We analyze a two-particle state and show that when mismatching the detector
frequency response and the field frequency spectrum, several anomalous features
become apparent. In particular, while we find several well known features, such
as $g^{(2)}(\tau=0)=1/2$ for completely indistinguishable particles, we also
find that as the photons are slightly separated and may be distinguished,
$g^{(2)}$ may oscillate as a function of the detector bandwidth. Beyond the
latter interesting observation for which we cannot find a simple physical
origin, we also suggest, an interpretation with regard to an oscillating
$g^{(2)}$ complementarity.

specific interior spacetime setup, namely the homogeneous and isotropic FLRW
metric, we obtain two classes of solutions to the field equations where
depending on the relation between spin source parameters, $(i)$ the collapse
procedure culminates in a spacetime singularity or $(ii)$ it is replaced by a
non-singular bounce. We show that, under certain conditions, for a specific
subset of the former solutions, the formation of trapped surfaces is prevented
and thus the resulted singularity could be naked. The curvature singularity
that forms could be gravitationally strong in the sense of Tipler. Our
numerical analysis for the latter solutions shows that the collapsing dynamical
process experiences four phases, so that two of which occur at the pre-bounce
and the other two at post-bounce regimes. We further observe that there can be
found a minimum radius for the apparent horizon curve, such that the main
outcome of which is that there exists an upper bound for the size of the
collapsing body, below which no horizon forms throughout the whole scenario.

preserving Nos\'{e}-Hoover thermostat was used to control the temperature. The
droplet nucleation, motion, collision and coalescence dynamics in the
nonequilibrium case were studied in the canonical ensemble with Nos\'{e}-Hoover
thermostat. There it was observed that the average droplet volume grows
linearly with time. Between two successive collisions, the size of the droplets
remain same even though all the constituent particles do not move with the
droplets \textminus some leave, others join. It is seen that the number of
original particles in a droplet decays exponentially fast. Results from a

to characterize the extrasolar planet and its atmosphere. The observational
challenges of these measurements require dedicated instrumentation and only the
space environment allows an undisturbed access to earth-like atmospheric
features such as water or carbon-dioxide. Therefore, several exoplanet-specific
space missions are currently being studied. One of them is EChO, the Exoplanet
Characterization Observatory, which is part of ESA's Cosmic Vision 2015-2025
program, and which is one of four candidates for the M3 launch slot in 2024. In
this paper we present the results of our assessment study of the EChO
spectrometer, the only science instrument onboard this spacecraft. The
instrument is a multi-channel all-reflective dispersive spectrometer, covering
the wavelength range from 400 nm to 16 microns simultaneously with a moderately
low spectral resolution. We illustrate how the key technical challenge of the
EChO mission - the high photometric stability - influences the choice of
spectrometer concept and drives fundamentally the instrument design. First
performance evaluations underline the fitness of the elaborated design solution
for the needs of the EChO mission.

and 22 March 2012, during the quiescent state of the neutron-star X-ray binary
SAX J1750.8-2900. In these observations, the source was either just detected or
undetected, depending on the exposure length (which ranged from ~0.3 to ~3.8
ks). The upper limits for the non-detections were consistent with the detected
luminosities (when fitting a thermal model to the spectrum) of ~1E34 erg/s
(0.5-10 keV). This level is consistent with what has been measured previously
for this source in quiescence. However, on March 17 the source was found to
have an order of magnitude larger count rate. When fitting the flare spectrum
with an absorbed power-law model, we obtained a flare luminosity of (3-4) 1E34
erg/s (0.5-10 keV). Follow-up Swift observations showed that this flare lasted
<16 days. This event was very likely due to a brief episode of low-level
accretion onto the neutron star and provides further evidence that the
quiescent state of neutron-star X-ray transients might not be as quiet as is
generally assumed. The detection of this low-level accretion flare raises the
question whether the quiescent emission of the source (outside the flare) could
also be due to residual accretion, albeit continuous instead of episodic.
However, we provide arguments which would suggest that the lowest intensity
level might instead represent the cooling of the accretion-heated neutron star.

Multi-coupled DE (McDE) model was proposed by Baldi 2012 as a particular
realization of an interacting Dark Energy field characterized by an effective
screening mechanism capable of suppressing the effects of the coupling at the
background and linear perturbation level. In the present paper, for the first
time, we challenge the McDE scenario through a direct comparison with real
data, in particular with the luminosity distance of Type Ia supernovae. By
studying the existence and stability conditions of the critical points of the
associated background dynamical system, we select only the cosmologically
consistent solutions, and confront their background expansion history with
data. Confirming previous qualitative results, the McDE scenario appears to be
fully consistent with the adopted sample of Type Ia supernovae, even for
coupling values corresponding to an associated scalar fifth-force about four
orders of magnitude stronger than standard gravity. Our analysis demonstrates
the effectiveness of the McDE background screening, and shows some new
non-trivial asymptotic solutions for the future evolution of the universe. Our
results show how the background expansion history might be highly insensitive

semimajor axis drift and rotational acceleration. We produce a unified model
that can accurately match both observed effects using a single set of
thermophysical properties derived from ground-based observations, and we
determine Apollo's long term evolution. We use light-curve shape inversion
techniques and the ATPM on published light-curve, thermal-infrared, and radar
observations to constrain Apollo's thermophysical properties. The derived
properties are used to make detailed predictions of Apollo's Yarkovsky and YORP
effects, which are then compared with published measurements of orbital drift
and rotational acceleration. The ATPM explicitly incorporates 1D heat
conduction, shadowing, multiple scattering of sunlight, global self-heating,
and rough surface thermal-infrared beaming in the model predictions. We find
that ATPM can accurately reproduce the light-curve, thermal-infrared, and radar
observations of Apollo, and simultaneously match the observed orbital drift and
rotational acceleration using: a shape model with axis ratios of
1.94:1.65:1.00, an effective diameter of 1.55 +/- 0.07 km, a geometric albedo
of 0.20 +/- 0.02, a thermal inertia of 140 +140/-100 J m-2 K-1 s-1/2, a highly
rough surface, and a bulk density of 2850 +480/-680 kg m-3. Using these
properties we predict that Apollo's obliquity is increasing towards the 180
degree YORP asymptotic state at a rate of 1.5 +0.3/-0.5 degrees per 10^5 yr.
The derived thermal inertia suggests that Apollo has loose regolith material
resting on its surface, which is consistent with Apollo undergoing a recent
resurfacing event based on its observed Q-type spectrum. The inferred bulk
density is consistent with those determined for other S-type asteroids, and
suggests that Apollo has a fractured interior.

superconducting wire after instant in time and local in space heating, which
models the absorption of the single photon by the wire. We find that the
presence of constriction favors detection of photons of various energies but
the presence of turn increases only ability to detect relatively ""low"" energy
photons. The main reason is that in case of constriction the current density is
increased over whole length and width of the constriction while in case of the
turn the current density is enhanced only near the inner corner of the turn. It
results in inhomogeneous Joule heating near the turn and worsens the conditions
for appearance of the normal domain at relatively small currents when the
""high"" energy photons already could create normal domain in straight part of
the wire. We also find that the amplitude of the voltage pulse depends on the
place where the photon is absorbed. It is the smallest one when photon is
absorbed near the turn and it is the largest one when photon is absorbed near
the constriction. This effect comes from the difference in resistance of
constriction and the turn in the normal state from the resistance of the rest
of the wire.

galaxies were identified as having a peculiar dynamical $M/L$. The aim of this
study is to confirm or disprove the preliminary findings, indicating a
non-standard stellar initial mass function (IMF) for the galaxies. The surface
photometry in B, V, and R bands was carried out with the Apache Point 0.5-m
telescope and the \ion{H}{I} data cubes were obtained with the Westerbork
Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT). Photometric profiles were decomposed into
bulge and exponential disk components. Using the obtained \ion{H}{I} data
cubes, rotation curves of both galaxies were constructed. Employing the
photometric profiles, the mass distribution of the galaxies was decomposed into
mass components: bulge, stellar disk, gas, and pseudo-isothermal dark halo. We
conclude that NGC 6824 possesses a stellar disk with mass-to-light ratio
$(M/L_B)_{\rm disk} = 2.5$, in agreement with its color $(B-V)_0$. On the
contrary, UGC 11919 appears to have a very lightweight disk. Its dynamically
estimated mass corresponds to a low stellar disk mass-to-light ratio
$(M/L_B)_{\rm disk} \approx 0.5$. Under standard assumptions, this ratio does
not agree with the relatively red color of the disk, while a bottom light
stellar initial mass function is needed to explain the observations.

that the critical control parameter a_c is bounded by its limit values for weak

differs. For weak noise the distribution is Gaussian and the symmetry is broken
as the whole distribution is shifted in either the positive or the negative

the symmetry is broken as the weights of the peaks become different. We derive
an ordinary differential equation whose solution describes the critical

determine the critical manifold for weak and for strong noise and compare it to

excellent opportunity to study the distribution and properties of the dust
within them. The HEROES project was set up to observe a sample of seven large
edge-on galaxies across various wavelengths for this investigation.
  Aims. Within this first paper, we present the Herschel observations and
perform a qualitative and quantitative analysis on them, and we derive some
global properties of the far infrared and submillimetre emission.
  Methods. We determine horizontal and vertical profiles from the Herschel
observations of the galaxies in the sample and describe the morphology.
Modified black-body fits to the global fluxes, measured using aperture
photometry, result in dust temperatures and dust masses. The latter values are
compared to those that are derived from radiative transfer models taken from
the literature.
  Results. On the whole, our Herschel flux measurements agree well with
archival values. We find that the exponential horizontal dust distribution
model often used in the literature generally provides a good description of the
observed horizontal profiles. Three out of the seven galaxies show signatures
of extended vertical emission at 100 and 160 {\mu}m at the 5{\sigma} level, but
in two of these it is probably due to deviations from an exactly edge-on
orientation. Only for NGC 4013, a galaxy in which vertically extended dust has
already been detected in optical images, we can detect vertically extended
dust, and the derived scaleheight agrees with the value estimated through
radiative transfer modelling. Our analysis hints at a correlation between the
dust scaleheight and its degree of clumpiness, which we infer from the
difference between the dust masses as calculated from modelling of optical data
and from fitting the spectral energy distribution of Herschel datapoints.

immediate corollary of this construction is that the curved superspace is
conformally flat if and only if the super Cotton tensor vanishes. Upon

the strong attractive force and results in a significant reduction of adhesion
and sliding friction. When two graphene layers are inserted, each graphene is
attached to one of the metal surfaces with a significant binding and reduces
the adhesion further. In the sliding motion of these surfaces the transition
from stick-slip to continuous sliding is attained, whereby non-equilibrium
phonon generation through sudden processes is suppressed. The adhesion and
corrugation strength continues to decrease upon insertion of the third graphene
layer and eventually saturates at a constant value with increasing number of
graphene layers. In the absence of Ni surfaces, the corrugation strength of
multilayered graphene is relatively higher and practically independent of the
number of layers. Present first-principles calculations reveal the
superlubricant feature of graphene layers placed between pseudomorphic Ni(111)
surfaces, which is achieved through the coupling of Ni-3d and graphene-$\pi$

systems is expected to include the formation of gaps and the depletion of dust
and gas. *Aims A special group of flaring disks around Herbig Ae/Be stars do
not show prominent silicate emission features. We focus our attention on four
key Herbig Ae/Be stars to understand the structural properties responsible for
the absence of silicate feature emission. *Methods We investigate Q- and N-band
images taken with Subaru/COMICS, Gemini South/T-ReCS and VLT/VISIR. Our
radiative transfer modeling solutions require a separation of inner- and outer-
disks by a large gap. From this we characterize the radial density structure of
dust and PAHs in the disk. *Results The inner edge of the outer disk has a high
surface brightness and a typical temperature between ~100-150 K and therefore
dominates the emission in the Q-band. We derive radii of the inner edge of the
outer disk of 34, 23, 30 and 63 AU for HD97048, HD169142, HD135344B and Oph IRS
48 respectively. For HD97048 this is the first detection of a disk gap. The
continuum emission in the N-band is not due to emission in the wings of PAHs.
This continuum emission can be due to VSGs or to thermal emission from the
inner disk. We find that PAH emission is not always dominated by PAHs on the
surface of the outer disk. *Conclusions. The absence of silicate emission
features is due to the presence of large gaps in the critical temperature
regime. Many, if not all Herbig disks with Spectral Energy Distribution (SED)
classification `group I' are disks with large gaps and can be characterized as
(pre-) transitional. An evolutionary path from the observed group I to the
observed group II sources seems no longer likely. Instead, both might derive
from a common ancestor.

off-diagonal elements store the correlations between the collapsing shell and

collapsed body. The rate of escape of information is initially very small,
increasing to order one by the Page time, when the black hole has lost half its

the high-mass young stellar object NGC 7538 IRS9, whose weak complex molecule
emission previously escaped detection, quantifying the emission and abundance
profiles of key organic molecules as a function of distance from the central
protostar. We find that emission from N-bearing organics and saturated
O-bearing organics present large increases in emission around 8000 AU and
R<3000 AU, while O-bearing molecules and hydrocarbons do not. The increase in
flux from some complex molecules in the envelope, around 8000 AU or 25 K, is
consistent with recent model predictions of an onset of complex ice chemistry
at 20-30 K. The emission increase for some molecules at R<3000 AU suggests the
presence of a weak hot core, where thermal ice evaporation and hot gas-phase
chemistry drives the chemistry. Complex organics thus form at all radii and

optical spectroscopic observations from 4 to 270 days after explosion of a
newly discovered type II SN 2012aw in a nearby (~9.9 Mpc) galaxy M95. The
light-curve characteristics of apparent magnitudes, colors, bolometric
luminosity and the presence and evolution of prominent spectral features are
found to have striking similarity with the archetypal IIP SNe 1999em, 1999gi
and 2004et. The early time observations of SN 2012aw clearly detect minima in
the light-curve of V, R and I bands near 37 days after explosion and this we
suggest to be an observational evidence for emergence of recombination phase.
The mid-plateau MV magnitude (-16.67 $\pm$ 0.04) lies in between the bright (~
-18) and subluminous (~ -15) IIP SNe. The mass of nickel is 0.06$\pm$0.01
M_sun. The SYNOW modelling of spectra indicate that the value and evolution of
photospheric velocity is similar to SN 2004et, but about ~600 km/s higher than
that of SNe 1999em and 1999gi at comparable epochs. This trend is more apparent
in the line velocities of H alpha and H beta. A comparison of ejecta velocity
properties with that of existing radiation-hydrodynamical simulations indicate
that the energy of explosion lies in the range 1-2x10^51 ergs; a further
comparison of nebular phase [Oi] doublet luminosity with SNe 2004et and 1987A
indicate that the mass of progenitor star is about 14-15 M_sun. The presence of
high-velocity absorption features in the mid-to-late plateau and possibly in
early phase spectra show signs of interaction between ejecta and the
circumstellar matter; being consistent with its early-time detection at X-ray
and radio wavebands.

approaches to quantum-gravity, whereby the spectral dimension of spacetime runs
from the standard value of 4 in the infrared (IR) to a smaller value in the
ultraviolet (UV). Specifically, we invoke the picture where the phenomenon is
associated with modified dispersion relations. With minimal assumptions, we
find that UV behaviour leading to 2 spectral dimensions results in an exactly
scale-invariant spectrum of vacuum scalar and tensor fluctuations, regardless
of the equation of state. The fluctuation production mechanism is analogous to
the one known for varying speed of sound/light models and, unlike in inflation,
the spectrum is already scale-invariant before leaving the horizon, remaining
so after freeze-in. In the light of Planck's recent results we also discuss
scenarios that break exact scale-invariance, such as the possibility that the
spectral dimension runs down to a value slightly higher than 2, or runs down to
2 but with an extremely slow transient. We further show that the tensor to
scalar ratio is fixed by the UV ratio between the speed of gravity and the
speed of light. Not only does our model not require inflation, but at its most
minimal it seems incompatible with it. In contrast, we find that running
spectral dimensions can improve the outlook of the cyclic/ekpyrotic scenario,
solving the main problems present in its simplest and most appealing
realisations.

comes at the cost of compile-time predictability. Many of the hallmarks of
dynamic languages such as closures, continuations, various forms of reflection,
and a lack of static types make many programmers rejoice, while compiler
writers, tool developers, and verification engineers lament. The dynamism of
these features simply confounds statically reasoning about programs that use
them. Consequently, static analyses for dynamic languages are few, far between,
and seldom sound.
  The ""abstracting abstract machines"" (AAM) approach to constructing static
analyses has recently been proposed as a method to ameliorate the difficulty of
designing analyses for such language features. The approach, so called because
it derives a function for the sound and computable approximation of program
behavior starting from the abstract machine semantics of a language, provides a
viable approach to dynamic language analysis since all that is required is a
machine description of the interpreter.
  The original AAM recipe produces finite state abstractions, which cannot
faithfully represent an interpreter's control stack. Recent advances have shown
that higher-order programs can be approximated with pushdown systems. However,
these automata theoretic models either break down on features that inspect or
modify the control stack.
  In this paper, we tackle the problem of bringing pushdown flow analysis to
the domain of dynamic language features. We revise the abstracting abstract
machines technique to target the stronger computational model of pushdown
systems. In place of automata theory, we use only abstract machines and
memoization. As case studies, we show the technique applies to a language with
closures, garbage collection, stack-inspection, and first-class composable
continuations.

track the evolution. We show that at least some of the emission must come from
highly relativistic material since two show an apparent super-luminal expansion
of the thermal component. Furthermore we determine very large luminosities and
high temperatures for many of the components-too high to originate in a SN
shock break-out. Instead we suggest that the component may be modelled as late
photospheric emission from the jet, linking it to the apparently thermal
component observed in the prompt emission of some GRBs at gamma-ray and hard
X-ray energies. By comparing the parameters from the prompt emission and the
early afterglow emission we find that the results are compatible with the

been shown to hold generally. But suppose we introduce an inhomogeneous
metamaterial into a cavity that effectively implements a simple distortion of
the coordinate system. Considered in its 'virtual space', the optical
properties of such a material are homogeneous and consequently free from the
cutoff-dependency associated with inhomogeneous media. This conclusion should
be reconciled with recent advances in our understanding of Casimir-Lifshitz
forces. We consider an example of such a system here and demonstrate that,
whilst the size of the Casimir force is modified by the inhomogeneous medium,
the force is cutoff-independent and can be stated exactly. The apparent paradox
dissolves when we recognise that an idealised metamaterial that could implement
a virtual geometry for all frequencies would be devoid of internal scattering,
and would not give rise to a cutoff-dependency in the Casimir force for that
reason.

dominantly left-handed in the Standard Model (SM), but the right-handed
polarization may be enhanced in some new physics models with right-handed
currents, such as the Left-Right Symmetric Model (LRSM). In this article, we
investigate how large this wrong polarization could be within the allowed
parameter space of the LRSM. We show that in LRSM, the right-handed
polarization of the photon in the $b\to s\gamma$ processes could be largely
enhanced by the $W_L-W_R$ mixing contributions because of the helicity flip on
the internal top quark line of the penguin diagrams and the enhancement by the
CKM factor $V_{ts}^R/V_{ts}^L$. We discuss the sensitivity of the proposed
methods to determine the $b\to s\gamma$ photon polarization to the LRSM as well
as their complementary role compared to the direct search of right-handed
charged gauge bosons at LHC.

charge current or by applying external time-dependent fields. On the other
hand, theoretical approaches to calculate them operate with both the
nonequilibrium (carried by electrons around the Fermi surface) and the
equilibrium (carried by the Fermi sea electrons) contributions. Thus, an
unambiguous procedure should remove the equilibrium contributions, thereby
rendering the nonequilibrium ones which are measurable and satisfy the
gauge-invariant condition according to which expectation values of physical
quantities should not change when electric potential everywhere is shifted by a
constant amount. Using the framework of nonequilibrium Green functions, we
delineate such procedure which yields the proper gauge-invariant nonequilibrium
density matrix in the linear-response and elastic transport regime for
current-carrying steady state of an open quantum system connected to two
macroscopic reservoirs. Its usage is illustrated by computing: (i) conventional
spin-transfer torque (STT) in asymmetric F/I/F magnetic tunnel junctions
(MTJs); (ii) unconventional STT in asymmetric N/I/F semi-MTJs with the strong
Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) at the I/F interface and injected current
perpendicular to that plane; and (iii) current-driven spin density within a
clean ferromagnetic Rashba spin-split two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) which
generates SO torque in laterally patterned N/F/I heterostructures when such
2DEG is located at the N/F interface and injected charge current flows parallel

transition in the holographic superconductor using the probe limit for a
nonlinear Maxwell field strength coupled to a massless scalar field. By
analytic methods, based on the variational Sturm- Liouville minimization
technique, we study the effects of the space-time dimension and the
non-linearity parameter on the critical temperature and the scalar condensation
of the dual operators on the boundary. Further, as a motivated result, we
analytically deduce the DC conductivity in the low and zero temperatures
regime. Especially in the zero temperature limit and in two dimensional toy
model, we thoroughly compute the conductivity analytically. Our work clarifies
more features of the holographic superconductors both in different space
dimensions and on the effect of the non-linearity in Maxwell's strength field.

solving a system of linear equations under the context of FFT, the time
complexity of computer based phase retrieval algorithm would be reduced. Here I
present such a method which is recursive but highly non-linear in nature, based
on a close look at the Fourier spectrum of the square of the function norm. In
a one dimensional problem it takes $O(N^2)$ steps of calculation to recover the
phases of an N component complex vector. This method could work in 1, 2 or even
higher dimensional finite Fourier analysis without changes in the behavior of
time complexity. For one dimensional problem the performance of an algorithm
based on this method is shown, where the limitations are discussed too,
especially when subject to random noises which contains significant high
frequency components.

Brans-Dicke (BD) model in which the scalar field is allowed to couple
non-minimally with matter sector. Extended holographic Ricci dark energy
(EHRDE) has been considered in the above framework of BD cosmology. Some
restrictions have been derived for the BD parameter $\omega$ and a stronger
matter-chameleon coupling has been observed with expansion of the universe. In
this framework, the equation of state parameter of EHRDE has behaved like
quintom. Also, we have reconstructed the potential and coupling function for BD
model for the EHRDE. It has been observed that potential function is increasing
as the matter-chameleon coupling is getting stronger.

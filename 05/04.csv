which are obervable in experiments, are related by a single parameter, the
fugacities $\xi=\exp(\mu/T)$. With the charge parity invariance, $Z_n$ and
$\xi$ can be determined. Thermodynamic quantities such as the number density
susceptibility and the kurtosis are then calculated from the grand canonical
partition function $Z(\xi,T)=\sum Z_n(T) \xi^n$, ($n=-N_{\rm max},\cdots,
N_{\rm max}$), for any chemical potential $\mu$, although the region over which
the results are reliable for these quantities is constrained by $N_{\rm max}$.
  We then calculate the Lee-Yang zeros, which are the zeros of $Z(\xi)$ in the
complex fugacity plane, as poles of $d\log Z(\xi)/d\xi$ by using the Cauchy
integral theorem. With the help of a multiple precision library, this method
provides any precision required without misidentification of the zeros.
  We analyse $Z_n$ from the net-proton number distributions recently measured
at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) by assuming the net-proton number
is approximately propotional to that of the baryon after the freeze-out, and
calculate the moments. We also evaluate the Lee-Yang zero structures obtained
from RHIC data and compare them with those obtained from lattice quantum
chromodynamics (QCD) calculations.
  Possible regions of QCD phase transition lines are estimated from the
thermodynamics quantities and the Lee-Yang zeros. We discuss how the limited
$N_{\rm max}$ in both experimental and numerical studies affects the
reliability of the thermodynamic results and Lee-Yang zeros.

probabilities <p_i>, given the observed set of items {m_i}, that are
distributed among n bins with an (unknown) set of probabilities {p_i} for being
placed in the ith bin. The problem is often formulated using Bayes theorem and
the multinomial distribution, along with a constant prior for the values of the
p_i, leading to a Dirichlet distribution for the {p_i}. The moments of the p_i
can then be calculated exactly. Here a new approach is suggested for the
calculation of the moments, that uses a change of variables that reduces the
problem to an integration over a portion of the surface of an n-dimensional
sphere. This greatly simplifies the calculation by allowing a straightforward
integration over (n-1) independent variables, with the constraints on the set
of p_i being automatically satisfied. For the Dirichlet and similar
distributions the problem simplifies even further, with the resulting integrals
subsequently factorising, allowing their easy evaluation in terms of Beta
functions. A proof by induction confirms existing calculations for the moments.
The advantage of the approach presented here is that the methods and results
apply with minimum or no modifications to numerical calculations that involve
more complicated distributions or non-constant prior distributions, for which
cases the numerical calculations will be greatly simplified.

structure. It was recently discovered that the symmetry of such a system allows
for interesting Rashba spin-orbit effects. A perpendicular electric field is
able to couple to the sublattice pseudospin, making it possible to electrically
tune and close the band gap. Therefore, external electric fields may generate a
topological phase transition from a topological insulator to a normal insulator
(or semimetal) and vice versa. The contribution of the present article to the
study of silicene is twofold: First, we perform a group theoretical analysis to
systematically construct the Hamiltonian in the vicinity of the $K$ points of
the Brillouin zone and discover a new, but symmetry allowed term. Subsequently,
we identify a tight binding model that corresponds to the group theoretically
derived Hamiltonian near the $K$ points. Second, we start from this tight
binding model to analyze the topological phase diagram of silicene by an
explicit calculation of the $Z_2$ topological invariant of the band structure.
To this end, we calculate the $Z_2$ topological invariant of the honeycomb
lattice in a manifestly gauge invariant way which allows us to include $S_z$
symmetry breaking terms -- like Rashba spin orbit interaction -- into the
topological analysis. Interestingly, we find that the interplay of two Rashba
terms can generate a non-trivial quantum spin Hall phase in silicene. This is
in sharp contrast to the more extensively studied honeycomb system graphene
where Rashba spin orbit interaction is known to compete with the quantum spin
Hall effect in a potentially detrimental way.

accretion in low-mass protostellar disks. Here we present the first analysis of
the global structure and evolution of non-ideal MRI-driven T-Tauri disks on
million-year timescales. We accomplish this in a 1+1D simulation by calculating
magnetic diffusivities and utilizing turbulence activity criteria to determine
thermal structure and accretion rate without resorting to a 3-D
magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulation. Our major findings are as follows.
First, even for modest surface densities of just a few times the minimum-mass
solar nebula, the dead zone encompasses the giant planet-forming region,
preserving any compositional gradients. Second, the surface density of the
active layer is nearly constant in time at roughly 10 g/cm2, which we use to
derive a simple prescription for viscous heating in MRI-active disks for those
who wish to avoid detailed MHD computations. Furthermore, unlike a standard
disk with constant-alpha viscosity, the disk midplane does not cool off over
time, though the surface cools as the star evolves along the Hayashi track. The
ice line is firmly in the terrestrial planet-forming region throughout disk
evolution and can move either inward or outward with time, depending on whether
pileups form near the star. Finally, steady-state mass transport is a poor
description of flow through an MRI-active disk. We caution that MRI activity is
sensitive to many parameters, including stellar X-ray flux, grain size,
gas/small grain mass ratio and magnetic field strength, and we have not
performed an exhaustive parameter study here.

cloud superposed on the faint western part of the SNR. The cloud was elongated

the radio features of the SNR. We carried out 12CO J=2-1 line observations of

relation, strongly suggested that the molecular cloud was interacting with the
SNR. The systemic velocity of the molecular cloud (-13 km/s) gave a kinematic
distance of 3.0 kpc to the SNR-molecular cloud system. We derived the physical
parameters of the SNR based on this new distance. We examined the variation of
the radio spectral index over the remnant and found that it was flatter in the
western part, wherein the SNR was interacting with the molecular cloud. We
therefore propose that 3C434.1 is the remnant of a supernova explosion that
occurred just outside the boundary of a relatively thin, sheetlike molecular
cloud. We present a hydrodynamic model showing that its asymmetric radio
morphology can result from its interaction with this blocking molecular cloud.

combinatorial explosion in the number of contingencies, by seeking
vulnerabilities in intermediary solutions and constraining the design space
accordingly. Our approach is built on our ability to identify such system
vulnerabilities quickly. Our empirical studies on modified instances from the
IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 57-bus systems show the effectiveness of our methods. We
were able to solve the transmission and generation expansion problems for k=4
under 2 minutes, while other approaches failed to provide a solution at the end

orders of magnitude leading to the change of the radiation regime -- from
synchrotron to the curvature mode. To explore the character of this transition,
we solve numerically the equations of motion of a test particle in a dipole
magnetic field, and calculate the energy spectrum of magnetic bremsstrahlung
self-consistently, i.e. without a priori assumptions on the radiation regime.
In this way we can trace the transitions between the synchrotron and curvature
regimes, as well as study the third (intermediate or the so-called
synchro-curvature) regime. We briefly discuss three interesting astrophysical
scenarios, the radiation of electrons in the pulsar magnetosphere in the polar

At time zero the test particle is described by a spherical wave, i.e. a highly
correlated continuous superposition of states with well localized position and
momentum, and the oscillators are in the ground state. Under suitable
assumptions on the physical parameters characterizing the model, we give an
asymptotic expression of the solution of the Schr\""odinger equation of the

approximate expression of the wave function is the sum of two terms, orthogonal
in $L^2(\erre^{3(N+1)})$ and describing rather different situations. In the
first one all the oscillators remain in their ground state and the test
particle is described by the free evolution of a slightly deformed spherical
wave. The second one consists of a sum of $N$ terms where in each term there is
only one excited oscillator and the test particle is correspondingly described
by the free evolution of a wave packet, well concentrated in position and

average momentum parallel to the line joining the oscillator with the center of
the initial spherical wave. Such wave packet represents a semiclassical state
for the test particle, propagating along the corresponding classical

  Reordering and Minor Revisions. Four figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The concept of entangled quantum states is considered in the context of
systems of identical particles, based on the requirement that in order to
represent physical states both for the overall system and the sub-systems which
may be entangled, the density operators must satisfy the symmetrisation
principle and global and local super-selection rules that prohibit states in
which there are coherences between differing particle numbers. These
requirements and their justification are fully discussed. In the second
quantisation approach used, both the system and the sub-systems are modes (or
sets of modes) rather than particles, particles being associated with different
occupancies of the modes. The definition of entangled states is based on first
defining the non-entangled states - after specifying which modes constitute the
sub-systems. This paper mainly focuses on two mode entanglement for massive
bosons. Several inequalities involving variances and mean values of operators
involving mode annihilation, creation operators have been proposed as tests for
two mode entangled states, including the inequalities that define spin
squeezing. Spin squeezing criteria in two mode systems are examined, and spin
squeezing is best considered for principle spin operator components where the
covariance matrix is diagonal. It is shown that the presence of spin squeezing
in at least one of the spin components requires entanglement of the relevant
pair of modes. Several of the other proposed tests for entanglement, including
ones based on the sum of the variances for two spin components are considered.
All of the tests are still valid when the present concept of entanglement based
on the symmetrisation and super-selection rule criteria is applied, but further
tests have been obtained here. Sometimes the new tests are satisfied whilst
than those obtained in other papers are not.

suggests the SUSY particles are of order 100 GeV, which is also supported by
discussions on the little hierarchy problem. However, the LHC experiments have
found no scalar-quarks or gluinos in such mass range, and moreover, the Higgs
boson mass of 126 GeV requires, within the MSSM framework, the scalar-top mass
of order 1-10 TeV. This current status forces us to abandon the simplest
supersymmetry-breaking frameworks of the CMSSM and the GMSB scenarios.
  The V-MSSM is investigated in this dissertation, which is proposed as an
extension of the MSSM with a (10 + 10bar) pair of the SU(5) decuplets. In the
framework the Higgs mass is increased by effect from the extra matters, and
thus the 126 GeV is achieved with the scalar-top having a lighter mass. This
fact resurrects the CMSSM and the GMSB scenarios. This dissertation examines
the GMSB scenario under the V-MSSM; it is called V-GMSB scenario.
  It is shown that the V-GMSB has a potential to realize the 126 GeV mass of
the Higgs boson with holding the explanation of the muon magnetic moment
discrepancy, if the masses of the extra quarks are approximately less than 1.2
TeV. Constraints on the V-GMSB from the LHC experiments are discussed then; it
is concluded that the gluino mass must be approximately heavier than 1.1 TeV,
and that the extra quarks be heavier than 300-650 GeV depending on the decay
branches of them.
  LHC prospects are briefly discussed. As the extra quarks are expected to be
approximately less than 1.2 TeV, searches for the particles are of great
interest at the 14 TeV LHC; constraints from the supersymmetry search,
especially on the gluino mass, are expected to be much improved there.
Therefore, it is expected that the fate of the V-GMSB is adjudicated at the
court of the 14 TeV LHC.

for constraining cosmological parameters compared to other cosmological probes.
The statistical power of a weak lensing survey is determined by the sky
coverage, the inverse of the noise in shear measurements, and the galaxy number
density. The combination of the latter two factors is often expressed in terms
of $n_{\rm eff}$ -- the ""effective number density of galaxies used for weak
lensing measurements"". In this work, we estimate $n_{\rm eff}$ for the Large
Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) project, the most powerful ground-based
lensing survey planned for the next two decades. We investigate how the
following factors affect the resulting $n_{\rm eff}$ of the survey with
detailed simulations: (1) survey time, (2) shear measurement algorithm, (3)
algorithm for combining multiple exposures, (4) inclusion of data from multiple
filter bands, (5) redshift distribution of the galaxies, and (6) masking and
blending. For the first time, we quantify in a general weak lensing analysis
pipeline the sensitivity of $n_{\rm eff}$ to the above factors.
  We find that with current weak lensing algorithms, expected distributions of
observing parameters, and all lensing data ($r$- and $i$-band, covering 18,000
degree$^{2}$ of sky) for LSST, $n_{\rm eff} \approx37$ arcmin$^{-2}$ before
considering blending and masking, $n_{\rm eff} \approx31$ arcmin$^{-2}$ when
rejecting seriously blended galaxies and $n_{\rm eff} \approx26$ arcmin$^{-2}$
when considering an additional 15% loss of galaxies due to masking. With future
improvements in weak lensing algorithms, these values could be expected to
increase by up to 20%. Throughout the paper, we also stress the ways in which
$n_{\rm eff}$ depends on our ability to understand and control systematic
effects in the measurements.

the spatial directions (infinite slab). Using the framework of grand-canonical
statistics, we consider the number of particles, the condensate fraction and
the specific heat. After obtaining asymptotic expansions for large system size,
which are valid throughout the BEC regime, we describe analytically how the
thermodynamic limit behaviour is approached. In particular, in the critical
region of the BEC transition, we express the chemical potential and the
specific heat as simple explicit functions of the temperature, highlighting the
effects of finite size. These effects are seen to be different for the two
different geometries. We also consider the Bose gas in a one-dimensional box, a
system which does not possess BEC in the sense of a phase transition even in
the infinite volume limit.

This result is a generalization of a result of Cimpri\vc, Helton, McCullough,
and the author.
  In the free left $\RR\axs$-module $\RR^{1 \times \ell}\axs$ we introduce
notions of the (noncommutative) zero set of a left $\RR\axs$-submodule and of a
real left $\RR\axs$-submodule. We prove that every element from $\RR^{1 \times

from a finite subset $S \subset \RR^{1 \times \ell}\axs$ belongs to the
smallest real left $\RR\axs$-submodule containing $S$. Using this, we derive a

  The other main contribution of this article is an efficient, implementable
algorithm which for every finite subset $S \subset \RR^{1 \times \ell}\axs$
computes the smallest real left $\RR\axs$-submodule containing $S$. This
algorithm terminates in a finite number of steps. By taking advantage of the
rigid structure of $\RR\axs$, the algorithm presented here is an improvement
upon the previously known algorithm for $\RR\axs$.

many events that are widely separated in space while occurring close together
in time. In some cases, sets of coronal events are evidently causally related,
while in many other instances indirect evidence can be found. We present case
studies to highlight a variety of coupling processes involved in coronal
events. We find that physical linkages between events do occur, but concur with
earlier studies that these couplings appear to be crucial to understanding the
initiation of major eruptive or explosive phenomena relatively infrequently. We
note that the post-eruption reconfiguration time scale of the large-scale
corona, estimated from the EUV afterglow, is on average longer than the mean
time between CMEs, so that many CMEs originate from a corona that is still
adjusting from a previous event. We argue that the coronal field is
intrinsically global: current systems build up over days to months, the
relaxation after eruptions continues over many hours, and evolving connections
easily span much of a hemisphere. This needs to be reflected in our modeling of
the connections from the solar surface into the heliosphere to properly model
the solar wind, its perturbations, and the generation and propagation of solar
energetic particles. However, the large-scale field cannot be constructed
reliably by currently available observational resources. We assess the
potential of high-quality observations from beyond Earth's perspective and
advanced global modeling to understand the couplings between coronal events in
the context of CMEs and solar energetic particle events.

including the physics of the polarized Compton process in the instrument
simulation, we are able to determine the instrument response for a linearly
polarized emission at any position angle. We compare the observed data with the
simulation sets by a minimum \chi^2 technique to determine the polarization
parameters of the source (angle and fraction). We have tested our analysis
procedure with Crab nebula observations and find a position angle similar to
those previously reported in the literature, with a comfortable significance.
Since the instrument response depends on the incident angle, each exposure in
the SPI data requires its own set of simulations, calculated for 18
polarization angles (from 0{\deg} to 170{\deg} in steps of 10{\deg}) and
unpolarized emission. The analysis of a large amount of observations for a
given source, required to obtain statistically significant results, represents
a large amount of computing time, but it is the only way to access this
complementary information in the hard X-ray regime. Indeed, major scientific
advances are expected from such studies since the observational results will
help to discriminate between the different models proposed for the high energy

from an optically-excited metal nanocrystal to a semiconductor contact or to
attached molecules. The distributions of optically-excited hot carriers are
dramatically different in metal nanocrystals with large and small sizes. In
large nanocrystals, most carriers have very small energies and the hot carrier
distribution resembles the case of a plasmon wave in bulk. In nanocrystals
smaller than 20nm, the carrier distribution extends to larger energies and
occupies the whole region E_{F}<E<omega. The physical reason for the above
behaviors is non-conservation of momentum in a nanocrystal. Because of the
above properties, nanocrystals of small sizes are most suitable for designing
of opto-electronic and photosynthetic devices based on injection of plasmonic
electrons and holes. The central parameter of the problem is
DeltaN=omega/q_{L}*v_{F}, where q_{L} is the momentum transfer and v_{F} is the
Fermi velocity. In gold nanocrystals, when DeltaN<7, the high-energy
hot-electron generation is efficient. For larger parameters DeltaN, the number
of high-energy electrons is greatly reduced. Another important factor is the
polarization of the exciting light. For efficient excitation of carriers with
high energies, the electric-field polarization vector should be perpendicular
to a prism-like nanoantenna (slab or platelet) with a small width ~ 10-20 nm.
We also show the relation between our theory for injection in plasmonic
nanocrystals and the Fowler theory of injection from a bulk metal. Along with a
prism geometry (or platelet geometry), we consider cubes. The results can be
applied to design both purely solid-state opto-electronic devices and systems
for photo-catalysis and solar conversion.

During encryption this stream is chopped into manageable sized blocks with

square matrix of suitable order following the concept of Spiral matrix. This
square matrix splits into 2x2 sub-matrices. Bits are taken column-wise from all
2x2 sub-matrices to form the encrypted binary string. Cipher text is generated
from this encrypted binary string. Combination of values of block length and
no. of blocks of a session generates the session key for SMBBOT. For decryption
the cipher text is considered as binary bit string. Processing the session key
information, this binary string is broken down into predefined blocks. Bits of
these blocks are taken from MSB to LSB to fit column-wise into 2x2 square
matrices. Using these sub-matrices a single square matrix with suitable order
is formed. The decrypted binary string is formed after taking the bits from the
square matrix following the reverse concept of Spiral Matrix. The plain text is
regenerated from decrypted binary string. A comparison of SMBBOT with existing

anticorrelation of the peak flux with the peak epoch: F_p ~ t_p^{-2.0} in the
optical, F_p ~ t_p^{-1.6} in the X-ray, the distributions of the peak epochs
being consistent with each other. We investigate the ability of two
forward-shock models for afterglow light-curve peaks -- an observer location
outside the initial jet aperture and the onset of the forward-shock
deceleration -- to account for those peak correlations. For both models, the
slope of the F_p - t_p relation depends only on the slope of the afterglow
spectrum. We find that only a conical jet seen off-aperture and interacting
with a wind-like medium can account for both the X-ray peak relation, given the
average X-ray spectral slope beta_x = 1.0, and for the larger slope of the
optical peak relation. However, any conclusion about the origin of the peak
flux - peak epoch correlation is, at best, tentative, because the current
sample of X-ray peaks is too small to allow a reliable measurement of the F_p -

the trend of an increase of the variability periods as long as the stars
evolve. This evolutionary behavior is also noticed when comparing the period
distribution in the Galactic center and anti-center directions. These aspects
indicate a compatibility with stellar rotation, although more information is

hemispherical asymmetry generated in the models of multiple fields inflation.
We show that $A$ is controlled by the weighted sum of non-Gaussianity

decode-and-forward (DF) protocols are considered. We propose the AF and DF

wireless security against eavesdropping attack. For the purpose of comparison,
we examine the traditional AFbORS and DFbORS schemes, denoted by T-AFbORS and
TDFbORS, respectively. We also investigate a so-called multiple relay combining
(MRC) framework and present the traditional AF and DF based MRC schemes, called
T-AFbMRC and TDFbMRC, where multiple relays participate in forwarding the
source signal to destination which then combines its received signals from the
multiple relays. We derive closed-form intercept probability expressions of the
proposed AFbORS and DFbORS (i.e., P-AFbORS and P-DFbORS) as well as the
T-AFbORS, TDFbORS, T-AFbMRC and T-DFbMRC schemes in the presence of
eavesdropping attack. We further conduct an asymptotic intercept probability
analysis to evaluate the diversity order performance of relay selection schemes
and show that no matter which relaying protocol is considered (i.e., AF and
DF), the traditional and proposed optimal relay selection approaches both
achieve the diversity order M where M represents the number of relays. In
addition, numerical results show that for both AF and DF protocols, the
intercept probability performance of proposed optimal relay selection is
strictly better than that of the traditional relay selection and multiple relay
combining methods.

In line with previous studies, we find that the gas at the centre of
high-redshift minihaloes becomes chemothermally unstable as three-body
reactions convert the atomic hydrogen into a fully molecular gas. The
competition between the increasing rate at which the gas cools and the
increasing optical depth to H2 line emission creates a characteristic dip in
the cooling time over the free-fall time on a scale of 100 au. As a result, the
free-fall time decreases to below the sound-crossing time, and the cloud may
become gravitationally unstable and fragment on a scale of a few tens of au
during the initial free-fall phase. In three of the nine haloes investigated,
secondary clumps condense out of the parent cloud, which will likely collapse
in their own right before they are accreted by the primary clump. In the other
haloes, fragmentation at such an early stage is less likely. However, given
that previous simulations have shown that the infall velocity decreases
substantially once the gas becomes rotationally supported, the amount of time
available for perturbations to develop may be much greater than is evident from
the limited period of time simulated here.

deviations from a Gaussian universe, except for projection effects. In
particular, the primordial contributions to the squeezed CMB bispectrum and

perturbations. The contributions to observed correlations are then only due to
projection effects such as gravitational lensing and redshift perturbations.

Our dynamical model provides a good match to the observed nuclear and overlap
star formation, especially when using a range of rather inefficient stellar
feedback efficiencies (0.01 < q_EoS < 0.1). In this case a simple conversion of
local star formation to molecular hydrogen surface density motivated by
observations accounts well for the observed distribution of CO. Using radiative
transfer post-processing we model synthetic far-infrared spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) and two-dimensional emission maps for direct comparison
with Herschel-PACS observations. For a gas-to-dust ratio of 62:1 and the best
matching range of stellar feedback efficiencies the synthetic far-infrared SEDs
of the central star forming region peak at values of ~65 - 81 Jy at 99 - 116
um, similar to a three-component modified black body fit to infrared
observations. Also the spatial distribution of the far-infrared emission at 70

emission in each band is concentrated in the overlap region while only < 30% (<
15%) is distributed to the combined emission from the two galactic nuclei in
the simulations (observations). As a proof of principle we show that parameter
variations in the feedback model result in unambiguous changes both in the
global and in the spatially resolved observable far-infrared properties of

spatially resolved comparative studies of matched galaxy merger simulations as
a valuable tool to constrain the fundamental star formation and feedback

characterised by different background and perturbation behaviours as a
consequence of the interaction between the DE field and CDM. We study the
results from three models differing in the background and perturbations
evolution, with the purpose to isolate their imprints in the lensing
observables. The scenarios investigated include a reference LCDM cosmology, a
standard coupled DE (cDE) scenario, and a ""bouncing"" cDE scenario. For the
standard cDE scenario, we find that differences in the lensing potential result
from two effects: the enhanced growth of linear CDM density fluctuations with
respect to the LCDM case, and the modified nonlinear dynamics of collapsed
structures induced by the DE-CDM interaction. As a consequence, CMB lensing
highlights the DE impact in the cosmological expansion, even in the degenerate
case where the amplitude of the linear matter density perturbations,
parametrised through sigma_8, is the same in both the standard cDE and LCDM
cosmologies. For the bouncing scenario, we find that the two opposite
behaviours of the lens density contrast and of the matter abundance lead to a
counter-intuitive effect, making the power of the lensing signal lower by 10%
than in the LCDM scenario. Moreover, we compare the behaviour of CDM and
baryons in CoDECS separately, in order to isolate effects coming from the
coupling with the DE component. We find that, in the bouncing scenario, baryons
show an opposite trend with respect to CDM, due to the coupling of the latter
with the DE component. [abridged]

component of gamma rays has been identified from the direction of the Galactic
Center, peaking at energies of ~2-3 GeV. More recently, it has been shown that
this signal is not confined to the innermost hundreds of parsecs of the Galaxy,
but instead extends to at least ~3 kpc from the Galactic Center. While the
spectrum, intensity, and angular distribution of this signal is in good
agreement with predictions from annihilating dark matter, it has also been
suggested that a population of unresolved millisecond pulsars could be
responsible for this excess GeV emission from the Inner Galaxy. In this paper,
we consider this later possibility in detail. Comparing the observed spectral
shape of the Inner Galaxy's GeV excess to the spectrum measured from 37
millisecond pulsars by Fermi, we find that these sources exhibit a spectral
shape that is much too soft at sub-GeV energies to accommodate this signal. We
also construct population models to describe the spatial distribution and
luminosity function of the Milky Way's millisecond pulsars. After taking into
account constraints from the observed distribution of Fermi sources (including
both sources known to be millisecond pulsars, and unidentified sources which
could be pulsars), we find that millisecond pulsars can account for no more
than ~10% of the Inner Galaxy's GeV excess. Each of these arguments strongly
disfavor millisecond pulsars as the source of this signal.

driving galaxy-wide superwinds in rapidly star-forming galaxies. We calculate
the combined dust and gas Eddington ratio (Gamma) for the archetypal superwind
of M82. By combining archival GALEX data, a standard dust model, Monte Carlo
dust scattering calculations, and the Herschel map of the dust surface density
distribution, the observed FUV/NUV surface brightness in the outflow constrains
both the total UV luminosity escaping from the starburst along its minor axis
(L_*, UV) and the flux-mean opacity, thus allowing a calculation of Gamma. We
find that L_(*, UV) ~ 1-6*10^42 ergs s^-1, ~2-12 times greater than the UV
luminosity observed from our line of sight. On a scale of 1-3 kpc above the
plane of M82, we find that Gamma ~ 0.01 - 0.06. On smaller scales (~0.25-0.5
kpc), where the enclosed mass decreases, our calculation of L_(*, UV) implies
that Gamma ~ 0.1 with factor of few uncertainties. Within the starburst itself,
we estimate the single-scattering Eddington ratio to be of order unity. Thus,
although radiation pressure is weak compared to gravity on kpc scales above the
plane of M82, it may yet be important in launching the observed outflow. We
discuss the primary uncertainties in our calculation, the sensitivity of Gamma
to the dust grain size distribution, and the time evolution of the wind
following M82's recent starburst episodes.

supernova remnant (Cas A, for short) has renewed tremendous interest in the
cooling mechanisms of neutron stars. In particular, the formation of
superconducting protons and superfluid neutrons deep inside the cores of
neutron stars have become focal points of the discussion. The purpose of this
letter is to add a new aspect to this discussion, which focuses on the
connection between proton superconductivity and the masses of neutron stars.
  Assuming (as is currently the case) that the temperature evolution of Cas A
is largely controlled by superconducting protons, we study a series of
phenomenological proton-pairing models to determine how deep into the stellar
core superconducting protons actually penetrate. This allows us to establish a
heretofore unknown relationship between the mass of the neutron star in Cas A
and the penetration depth of the superconducting proton phase. This
relationship can be used to either predict the depth of the superconducting
proton phase, or, conversely, determine the mass of Cas A from a reliable
calculation of the size of the proton superconducting phase in superdense
neutron star matter. We emphasize that the strategy outlined in this paper can
be applied to any other neutron star of similar age, whose temperature might be
reliably monitored over a several years period. High-mass neutron stars, such
as the recently discovered neutron stars J1614-2230 ($1.97 \pm 0.04\, \msun$)
and J0348+0432 ($2.01 \pm 0.04 \, \msun$), appear particularly appealing as a
significant fraction of the protons in their cores may be superconducting.

of the $B(B_s \to \mu^+ \mu^-)$ is in a remarkable agreement with the Standard

to that of the SM) makes the bounds on the RPV coupling products significantly

about 10000 channels. The ATLAS upgrade program is divided in three phases: The
Phase~0 occurs during 2013-2014, Phase~1 during 2018-1019 and finally Phase~2,
which is foreseen for 2022-2023, whereafter the peak luminosity will reach 5-7
x 10$^{34}$ cm$^2$s$^{-1}$ (HL-LHC). The main TileCal upgrade is focused on the
Phase~2 period. The upgrade aims at replacing the majority of the on- and
off-detector electronics so that all calorimeter signals are directly digitized
and sent to the off-detector electronics in the counting room. All new
electronics must be able to cope with the increased radiation levels. An
ambitious upgrade development program is pursued to study different electronics
options. Three options are presently being investigated for the front-end
electronic upgrade. The first option is an improved version of the present
system built using commercial components, the second alternative is based on
the development of a dedicated ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit)
and the third is the development of a new version of the QIE (Charge Integrator
and Encoder) based on the one developed for Fermilab. All three options will
use the same readout and control system using high speed (up to 40 Gb/s) links
for communication and clock synchronization. For the off-detector electronics a
new back-end architecture is being developed. A demonstrator prototype read-out
for a slice of the calorimeter with most of the new electronics, but still
compatible with the present system, is planned to be inserted in ATLAS already

crystal surfaces. For the square lattice, a lateral displacement between
opposing lattice electrodes modifies the pattern-forming behavior of the
system. In a stripe-electrode arrangement, each discharge filament terminates
in two dissimilar footprints, and the resulting pattern exhibits smectic
behavior. A circular ring template establishes periodic boundary conditions and
produces a new pattern in which adjacent filament footprints differ in shape.
Finally, electrodes featuring isolated and twinned pins are used to investigate
the pairing and clustering of filaments. We find that under certain conditions,
filament pairs may stabilize at either of two characteristic bonding distances.
We also study the range of distances over which a filament will either prevent

restrict our approaches to precoding-based linear schemes, where the senders
use precoding matrices to encode source symbols. We adapt a precoding-based
interference alignment technique, originally developed for the wireless

refer to as as a {\em precoding-based network alignment scheme (PBNA)}. A
primary difference between this setting and the wireless interference channel
is that the network topology can introduce dependencies between elements of the
transfer matrix, which we refer to as coupling relations, and can potentially
affect the achievable rate of PBNA. We identify all possible such coupling
relations, and interpret these coupling relations in terms of network topology
and present polynomial-time algorithms to check the presence of these coupling

dictionary atoms on statistics of the corresponding sparse coefficients.
Thirdly, adjust the rarity according to specific application and form a new

sparse coefficients. Compared with the traditional techniques, the proposed
method enhances image based on the image content not on distribution of pixel

more suitable for salient objects extraction. The experimental results

flows forced by Gaussian stochastic fields with white in time correlation
functions. This problem contains the stochastic dynamics of 2D Navier-Stokes
equation as a special case. We consider the limit of weak forces and
dissipation, when there is a time scale separation between the inertial time
scale (fast) and the spin-up or spin-down time (large) needed to reach an
average energy balance. In this limit, we show that an adiabatic reduction (or
stochastic averaging) of the dynamics can be performed. We then obtain a
kinetic equation that describes the slow evolution of zonal jets over a very
long time scale, where the effect of non-zonal turbulence has been integrated
out. The main theoretical difficulty, achieved in this work, is to analyze the
stationary distribution of a Lyapunov equation that describes quasi-Gaussian
fluctuations around each zonal jet, in the inertial limit. This is necessary to
prove that there is no ultraviolet divergence at leading order in such a way
that the asymptotic expansion is self-consistent. We obtain at leading order a
Fokker--Planck equation, associated to a stochastic kinetic equation, that
describes the slow jet dynamics. Its deterministic part is related to well
known phenomenological theories (for instance Stochastic Structural Stability
Theory) and to quasi-linear approximations, whereas the stochastic part allows
to go beyond the computation of the most probable zonal jet. We argue that the
effect of the stochastic part may be of huge importance when, as for instance
in the proximity of phase transitions, more than one attractor of the dynamics

coherent laser fields. But already an exchange of virtual photons with the
electromagnetic vacuum field alone can lead to quantum coherences, which
subsequently suppress spontaneous emission. We demonstrate such spontaneously
generated coherences (SGC) in a large ensemble of nuclei operating in the x-ray
regime, resonantly coupled to a common cavity environment. The observed SGC
originates from two fundamentally different mechanisms related to cooperative
emission and magnetically controlled anisotropy of the cavity vacuum. This
approach opens new perspectives for quantum control, quantum state engineering
and simulation of quantum many-body physics in an essentially decoherence-free
setting.

shown that brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) have increased their stellar mass
by a factor of almost two between z~0.9 and z~0.2. The numerical simulations
further suggest that more than half this mass is accreted through major
mergers. Using a sample of 18 distant galaxy clusters with over 600
spectroscopically confirmed cluster members between them, we search for
observational evidence that major mergers do play a significant role. We find a
major merger rate of 0.38 +/- 0.14 mergers per Gyr at z~1. While the
uncertainties, which stem from the small size of our sample, are relatively
large, our rate is consistent with the results that are derived from numerical
simulations. If we assume that this rate continues to the present day and that
half of the mass of the companion is accreted onto the BCG during these
mergers, then we find that this rate can explain the growth in the stellar mass
of the BCGs that is observed and predicted by simulations. Major mergers
therefore appear to be playing an important role, perhaps even the dominant
one, in the build up of stellar mass in these extraordinary galaxies.

some studies have claimed that the fractal property is not universal. This

In this paper, we propose an alternative, the ht-index, to quantify the fractal
or scaling structure of geographic features. A geographic feature has ht-index
h if the pattern of far more small things than large ones recurs (h-1) times at
different scales. The higher the ht-index, the more complex the geographic
feature. We conduct three case studies to illustrate how the computed
ht-indices capture the complexity of different geographic features. We further
discuss how the ht-index is complementary to fractal dimension, and elaborate
on a dynamic view behind the ht-index that enables better understanding of
geographic forms and processes.

B-L gauge field becomes massive via the Higgs mechanism. As a bonus of
conformal gravity, the massless dilaton field does not appear and the

has a practical application even if the scalar field does not possess any

1.534 and He I 1.083 um line images. This allows us to estimate the electron
density (~ 4,700-9,400 cm^-3) and extinction (Av ~ 16-20 mag) of the shell,
including detailed two-dimensional distribution of the properties in the
brightest clump, as well as the discovery of a faint high-velocity (~ -440
km/s) component in the clump. Our SNR shock model calculations estimate the
preshock number density of ~ 250-500 cm^-3 and shock speed of ~ 80-250 km/s in
the [Fe II]-emitting region of the SNR. The comparison between the observed and
modelled radial profiles of the line intensities and their ratios reveals that
the shell is composed of multiple thin filaments which have been likely formed
in episodic mass loss processes of a progenitor star. The discovery of the
faint high-velocity component supports the interpretation that the southeastern
shell of G11.2-0.3 is mainly composed of circumstellar material with

investigated Phosphonated-PEG amphiphilic oligomers behavior as strong surface
active species forming irreversibly adsorbed layers. We then show that the
oligomers interfacial properties translate to the functional nanoparticles. In
particular, the addition of a small fraction of phosphonated-PEG oligomers with
an extra C16 aliphatic chain (stickers) into the formulation enabled the tuning
of i) the nanoparticles adsorption at the air/water, polystyrene/water,
oil/water interfaces and ii) the particle/particle interaction in aqueous
solutions. We also found that dense and closely packed two dimensional
monolayers of nanoceria can be formed by spontaneous adsorption or surface
compression using a Langmuir trough. A hexagonal organization controlled by
reversible and repulsive repulsion has been characterized by GISAXS. Mono- or
multilayers can also be stably formed or transferred on solid surfaces. Our
results are key features in the field of polymer surface modification, solid
stabilized emulsions (Pickering) or supracolloidal assemblies.

Mathematics is now at a remarkable inflexion point, with new technology
radically extending the power and limits of individuals. Crowdsourcing pulls
together diverse experts to solve problems; symbolic computation tackles huge
routine calculations; and computers check proofs too long and complicated for
humans to comprehend.
  Mathematical practice is an emerging interdisciplinary field which draws on
philosophy and social science to understand how mathematics is produced. Online
mathematical activity provides a novel and rich source of data for empirical
investigation of mathematical practice - for example the community question
answering system {\it mathoverflow} contains around 40,000 mathematical
conversations, and {\it polymath} collaborations provide transcripts of the
process of discovering proofs. Our preliminary investigations have demonstrated
the importance of ""soft"" aspects such as analogy and creativity, alongside
deduction and proof, in the production of mathematics, and have given us new
ways to think about the roles of people and machines in creating new
mathematical knowledge. We discuss further investigation of these resources and
what it might reveal.
  Crowdsourced mathematical activity is an example of a ""social machine"", a new
paradigm, identified by Berners-Lee, for viewing a combination of people and
computers as a single problem-solving entity, and the subject of major
international research endeavours. We outline a future research agenda for
mathematics social machines, a combination of people, computers, and
mathematical archives to create and apply mathematics, with the potential to
change the way people do mathematics, and to transform the reach, pace, and

jets were observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar
Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board
SDO measured the vector magnetic field, from which we derive the magnetic flux
evolution, the photospheric velocity field, and the vertical electric current
evolution. The magnetic configuration before the jets is derived by the
nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolation.
  We derive that the jets are above a pair of parasitic magnetic bipoles which
are continuously driven by photospheric diverging flows. The interaction drove
the build up of electric currents that we indeed observed as elongated patterns
at the photospheric level. For the first time, the high temporal cadence of HMI
allows to follow the evolution of such small currents. In the jet region, we
found that the integrated absolute current peaks repetitively in phase with the
171 A flux evolution. The current build up and its decay are both fast, about
10 minutes each, and the current maximum precedes the 171 A by also about 10
minutes. Then, HMI temporal cadence is marginally fast enough to detect such
changes.
  The photospheric current pattern of the jets is found associated to the
quasi-separatrix layers deduced from the magnetic extrapolation. From previous
theoretical results, the observed diverging flows are expected to build
continuously such currents. We conclude that magnetic reconnection occurs
periodically, in the current layer created between the emerging bipoles and the
large scale active region field. It induced the observed recurrent coronal jets
and the decrease of the vertical electric current magnitude.

compact material boundaries. Our focus is the dynamic behavior of the
circulation of velocity around boundary components and the possible exchange
between flow vorticity and boundary circulation in flows with vortex sheet
initial data We begin by showing that the velocity can be uniquely
reconstructed from the vorticity and boundary component circulations, which
allows to recast 2D Euler evolution using vorticity and the circulations as
dynamic variables. The weak form of this vortex dynamics formulation of the
equations is called the weak vorticity formulation. The main result in this
article is the equivalence between the weak velocity and weak vorticity
formulations, without sign assumptions. Next, we focus on weak solutions
obtained by mollifying initial data and passing to the limit, with the portion
of vorticity singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure assumed to be
nonnegative. For these solutions we prove that the circulations around each
boundary component cannot be smaller than the initial data circulation, so that
nonnegative vorticity may be absorbed by the boundary, but not produced by the
boundary. In addition, we prove that if the weak solution conserves circulation
at the boundary components it is a boundary coupled weak solution, a stronger
version of the weak vorticity formulation. We prove existence of a weak
solution which conserves circulation at the boundary components if the initial
vorticity is integrable. In addition, we discuss the definition of the
mechanical force which the flow exerts on material boundary components and its
relation with conservation of circulation. Finally, we describe the
corresponding results for a bounded domain with holes, and the adaptations

parameterisation tailored for testing models of new physics. The choice of a
particular parameterisation depends on a non-obvious balance of quantity and
quality of the available experimental data, envisaged purpose for the
parameterisation and degree of model independence. At present only simple
parameterisations with a limited number of fit parameters can be performed, but
this situation will improve with the forthcoming experimental LHC data. It is
therefore important that different approaches are considered and that the most
detailed information is made available to allow testing the different aspects
of the Higgs boson physics and the possible hints beyond the Standard Model.

EPNet does both training and architecture evolution simultaneously, whereas NES
does a fixed network and only trains the network. Five mutation operators
proposed in EPNet to reflect the emphasis on evolving ANNs behaviors. Close
behavioral links between parents and their offspring are maintained by various
mutations, such as partial training and node splitting. On the other hand, NES
uses two new genetic operators - subpopulation-based max-mean arithmetical
crossover and time-variant mutation. The above-mentioned two algorithms have
been tested on a number of benchmark problems, such as the medical diagnosis
problems (breast cancer, diabetes, and heart disease). The results and the
comparison between them are also presented in this paper.

speed of a green particle that performs a random walk on top of a field of red
particles which themselves perform independent simple random walks on $\Z^d$,
$d \geq 1$. The red particles jump at rate 1 and are in a Poisson equilibrium
with density $\mu$. The green particle also jumps at rate 1, but uses different
transition kernels $p'$ and $p''$ depending on whether it sees a red particle
or not. It is shown that, in the limit as $\mu\to\infty$, the speed of the
green particle tends to the average jump under $p'$. This result is far from
surprising, but it is non-trivial to prove. The proof that is given in this
note is based on techniques that were developed in \cite{KeSi} to deal with
spread-of-infection models. The main difficulty is that, due to particle
conservation, space-time correlations in the field of red particles decay
slowly. This places the problem in a class of random walks in dynamic random
environments for which scaling laws are hard to obtain.

long-range effects of Coulomb interactions are accommodated. The reaction rate
of the process is calculated via an inverse process, three-alpha (3-\alpha)

times larger than that of the Nuclear Astrophysics Compilation of Reaction

electroweak sector of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) may hold
the key to the observed dark matter relic density in the universe even if all
strongly interacting sparticles are very heavy. The importance of the light EW
sparticles in DM physics and in producing spectacular collider signals is
emphasized. It is shown that even the preliminary data on the direct searches
of these sparticles at the LHC, significantly constrain the parameter space of
the MSSM compatible with the observed relic density and provide useful hints
about the future search prospects. If in addition to the electroweak sparticles
the gluinos are also within the reach of the LHC experiments, then the gluino
mass limits in the light slepton scenario obtained via the canonical jets +
$\met$ channel may be relaxed by as much as 25 $%$ compared to the existing
limits. But the corresponding same sign dilepton (SSD) + jets + $\met$ signal
will yield enhanced limits competitive with the strongest limits currently
available. This is illustrated with the help of benchmark scenarios at the
generator level using PYTHIA. If the gluinos are just beyond the current reach
of the LHC, then the generic n-lepton + m-jets + missing energy signal may
discriminate between different DM producing mechanisms by comparing the signals
corresponding to different values of n. This is illustrated by simulating the
signals for n = 0 and n = 2 (the SSD signal).

theoretically analyzed at various levels of approximations from time to time.
The primary aim was to check the validity of the quasi-steady-state
approximation, and hence emergence of the Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with
various substrate-enzyme ratios. But, conclusions vary. We solve here the
desired set of coupled nonlinear differential equations by invoking a new set
of dimensionless variables. Approximate solutions are obtained via the
power-series method aided by Pade approximants. The scheme works very
successfully in furnishing the initial dynamics at least up to the region where
existence of any steady state can be checked. A few conditions for its validity
are put forward and tested against the findings. Temporal profiles of the
substrate and the product are analyzed in addition to that of the complex to
gain further insights into legitimacy of the above approximation. Some recent
observations like the reactant stationary approximation and the notions of
different timescales are revisited. Signatures of the quasi-steady-state
approximation are also nicely detected by following the various reduced
concentration profiles in triangular plots. Conditions for the emergence of
Michaelis-Menten kinetics are scrutinized and it is stressed how one can get
the reaction constants even in the absence of any steady state.

mathematical structure that is called preorder (or quasi-order). For some pair
of unit systems, there exists a relation of preorder such that one unit system
is transferable to the other unit system. The transfer (or conversion) is
possible only when all of the quantities distinguishable in the latter system
are always distinguishable in the former system. By utilizing this structure,
we can systematically compare the representations in different unit systems.
Especially, the equivalence class of unit systems (EUS) plays an important role
because the representations of physical quantities and equations are of the
same form in unit systems belonging to an EUS. The dimension of quantities is
uniquely defined in each EUS. The EUS's form a partially ordered set. Using
these mathematical structures, unit systems and EUS's are systematically
classified and organized as a hierarchical tree.

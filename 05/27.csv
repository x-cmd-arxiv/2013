and studied its properties via magnetic susceptibility chi(T) and heat-capacity
Cp(T) measurements and also electronic structure calculations. Whereas the
crystal structure is suggestive of the presence of a quasi-2D network of Cu2+
(S = 1/2) buckled staircase Kagome layers, the chi(T) data show magnetic
anisotropy and three magnetic anomalies at temperatures, TN1 ~ 36 K, TN2 ~ 25
K, TN3 ~ 17 K, respectively. The chi(T) data follow the Curie-Weiss law above
200 K and a Curie-Weiss temperature Theta_CW ~ -150 K is obtained. The data
deviate from the simple Curie-Weiss law below 200 K, which is well above TN1,
suggesting the presence of competing magnetic interactions. The magnetic
anomaly at TN3 appears to be of first-order from magnetization measurements,
although our heat-capacity Cp(T) results do not display any anomaly at TN3. The
hopping integrals obtained from our electronic structure calculations suggest
the presence of significant intra-Kagome (next-nearest neighbor and diagonal)
and inter-Kagome couplings. These couplings take the PbCu3TeO7 system away from
a disordered ground state and lead to long-range order, in contrast to what
might be expected for an ideal (isotropic) 2D Kagome system.

generalized Verma modules, which significantly simplifies and generalizes many

explicit formula of such unique operators, for example, giving an intrinsic and

systematically estimating the effect of all possible single mutants, within a
certain radius of the active site, on the barrier height of an enzymatic
reaction. The intent of this method is not a quantitative prediction of the
barrier heights, but rather to identify promising mutants for further
computational or experimental study. The method is applied to identify
promising single and double mutants of Bacillus circulans xylanase (BCX) with
increased hydrolytic activity for the artificial substrate ortho-nitrophenyl
\beta-xylobioside (ONPX$_2$). The estimated reaction barrier for wild-type (WT)
BCX is 18.5 kcal/mol, which is in good agreement with the experimental
activation free energy value of 17.0 kcal/mol extracted from the observed
k$_\text{cat}$ using transition state theory (Joshi et al., Biochemistry 2001,
40, 10115). The PM6 reaction profiles for eight single point mutations are
recomputed using FMO-MP2/PCM/6-31G(d) single points. PM6 predicts an increase
in barrier height for all eight mutants while FMO predicts an increase for six
of the eight mutants. Both methods predict that the largest change in barrier
occurs for N35F, where PM6 and FMO predict a 9.0 and 15.8 kcal/mol increase,
respectively. We thus conclude that PM6 is sufficiently accurate to identify
promising mutants for further study. We prepared a set of all theoretically
possible (342) single mutants in which every amino acid of the active site
(except for the catalytically active residues E78 and E172) was mutated to
every other amino acid. Based on results from the single mutants we construct a
set of 111 double mutants consisting of all possible pairs of single mutants
with the lowest barrier for a particular position and compute their reaction
profile. None of the mutants have, to our knowledge, been prepared

general relativistic radiative transfer formulation in scattering media. An
explicit closed-form expression for a covariant Compton scattering kernel with
a good dynamical energy range has unfortunately not been available thus far.
Such an expression is essential to obtain numerical solutions to the general
relativistic radiative transfer equations in complicated astrophysical settings
where strong scattering effects are coupled with highly relativistic flows and
steep gravitational gradients. Moreover, this must be performed in an efficient
manner. With a self-consistent covariant approach, we have derived a
closed-form expression for the Compton scattering kernel for arbitrary energy
range. The scattering kernel and its angular moments are expressed in terms of
hypergeometric functions, and their derivations are shown explicitly in this
paper. We also evaluate the kernel and its moments numerically, assessing
various techniques for their calculation. Finally, we demonstrate that our
closed-form expression produces the same results as previous calculations,
which employ fully numerical computation methods and are applicable only in
more restrictive settings.

carves a deep gap in the dust component (shallower in the gas). Infrared
observations of the disk around the young star HD142527, at ~140pc, found an
inner disk ~10AU in radius, surrounded by a particularly large gap, with a
disrupted outer disk beyond 140AU, indicative of a perturbing planetary-mass
body at ~90 AU. From radio observations, the bulk mass is molecular and lies in
the outer disk, whose continuum emission has a horseshoe morphology. The
vigorous stellar accretion rate would deplete the inner disk in less than a
year, so in order to sustain the observed accretion, matter must flow from the
outer-disk into the cavity and cross the gap. In dynamical models, the putative
protoplanets channel outer-disk material into gap-crossing bridges that feed
stellar accretion through the inner disk. Here we report observations with the
Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA) that reveal diffuse CO gas inside the
gap, with denser HCO+ gas along gap-crossing filaments, and that confirm the
horseshoe morphology of the outer disk. The estimated flow rate of the gas is

language for test coverage, and developed the test case generation engine
FShell for ANSI C. In essence, an FQL test specification amounts to a set of
regular languages, each of which has to be matched by at least one test

an automata-theoretic concept known as rational sets of regular languages

Thus, the language accepted by the automaton is a set of regular expressions.
  In this paper, we study RSRLs from a theoretic point of view. More
specifically, we analyze RSRL closure properties under common set theoretic
operations, and the complexity of membership checking, i.e., whether a regular
language is an element of a RSRL. For all questions we investigate both the
general case and the case of finite sets of regular languages. Although a few
properties are left as open problems, the paper provides a systematic semantic

networks including website ranking. The quantum distribution becomes exactly
equal to the classical distribution when the walk has zero energy and at higher
energies the difference, the so-called quantumness, is bounded by the energy of
the initial state. We give an example for which the quantumness equals a Renyi
entropy of the normalized weighted degrees, guiding us to regimes for which the
classical degree-dependent result is recovered and others for which quantum
effects dominate.

can be substantial, an ab initio general coupled mode equation, in the form of
an eigenvalue problem, is derived. The solution of the master equation gives
the coupled frequencies and fields in terms of the uncoupled modes. By doing
so, the problem size is limited to the number of modes rather than the, usually
large, discretized spatial and temporal domains obtained by fullwave solvers.
Therefore, the method can be considered as a numerical recipe which determines

Besides quantitative analysis, the coupled mode equation proposes a pictorial
view of the split rings hybridization. It can be regarded as the
electromagnetic analog of molecular orbital theory. The solution of the
eigenvalue problem for different configurations gives valued information and
insight about the coupling of metamaterials unit cells. For instance, it is

predominantly contributed by the $d_{z^{2}}$, $d_{xy}$, and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$
orbitals of $M$ atoms, the TB model is constructed using these three orbitals
based on the symmetries of the monolayers. Parameters of the TB model are
fitted from the first-principles energy bands for all $MX_2$ monolayers. The TB
model involving only the nearest-neighbor $M$-$M$ hoppings is sufficient to
capture the band-edge properties in the $\pm K$ valleys, including the energy
dispersions as well as the Berry curvatures. The TB model involving up to the
third-nearest-neighbor $M$-$M$ hoppings can well reproduce the energy bands in
the entire Brillouin zone. Spin-orbit coupling in valence bands is well
accounted for by including the on-site spin-orbit interactions of $M$ atoms.
The conduction band also exhibits a small valley-dependent spin splitting which
has an overall sign difference between Mo$X_{2}$ and W$X_{2}$. We discuss the
origins of these corrections to the three-band model. The three-band TB model
developed here is efficient to account for low-energy physics in $MX_2$

system with a significant eccentricity using our new binary stellar evolution
code. The study focuses on a 1.50+1.40 Msun main sequence binary with an
eccentricity of 0.25, and an orbital period of about 0.7 d. The reaction of the
stellar components due to mass transfer is analyzed, and the evolution of mass
transfer during the periastron passage is compared to recent smooth particle
hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations. The impact of asynchronism and non-zero
eccentricity on the Roche lobe radius, and the effects of tidal and rotational
deformation on the stars' structures, are also investigated. Calculations were
performed using the state-of-the-art binary evolution code BINSTAR, which
calculates simultaneously the structure of the two stars and the evolution of
the orbital parameters. The evolution of the mass transfer rate during an orbit
has a Gaussian-like shape, with a maximum at periastron, in qualitative
agreement with SPH simulations. The Roche lobe radius is modified by the donor
star's spin and the orbital eccentricity. This has a significant impact on both
the duration and the rate of mass transfer. We find that below some critical
rotation rate, mass transfer never occurs, while above some threshold, mass is
transferred over the entire orbit. Tidal and rotational deformation of the
donor star causes it to become over-sized, enhancing the mass transfer rate
further by about a factor of ten, leading to non-conservative mass transfer.
The modulation of mass transfer rate with orbital phase produces short-term
variability in the surface luminosity and radius of each star. The longer-term
behaviour shows, in accordance with studies of circular systems with radiative
stars, that the donor becomes ever small and under-luminous, while the converse
is the case for the accretor.

time, denoted by $T_p^{max}$, is put forwarded to provide us a time-scale for
at most how long mathematically reliable (numerical) simulations of
trajectories of a chaotic dynamic system are physically correct. A special case
of three-body problem is used as an example to illustrate that, due to the
inherent, physical uncertainty of initial positions in the (dimensionless)
micro-level of $10^{-60}$, the chaotic trajectories are essentially uncertain
in physics after $t > T_p^{max}$, where $T_p^{max}\approx 810$ for this special
case of the three body problem. Thus, physically, it has no sense to talk about
the ""accurate, deterministic prediction"" of chaotic trajectories of the three
body problem after $t > T_p^{max}$. In addition, our mathematically reliable
simulations of the chaotic trajectories of the three bodies suggest that, due
to the butterfly effect of chaotic dynamic systems, the micro-level physical
uncertainty of initial conditions might transfer into macroscopic uncertainty.
This suggests that micro-level uncertainty might be an origin of some
macroscopic uncertainty. Besides, it might provide us a theoretical explanation
about the origin of uncertainty (or randomness) of many macroscopic phenomena
such as turbulent flows, the random distribution of stars in the universe, and
so on.

for the uncertainty of renewable energy forecasts, wind farm schedules are
determined so that they can be delivered over the transmission network with a

is pursued. Upon utilizing the structure of the DC optimal power flow (OPF), a

It is demonstrated below that the theorem can be violated, i.e. the Goldstone
modes possess finite gap, in the case of a novel ""Euclidian crystal"" (quantum
ordered) state of interacting fermions, that was proposed recently {mukhin
2011}. This result may lead to the important consequences when considered in
combination with another peculiar properties of the quantum order parameter
(QOP) that where recently found: QOP's Green's function is finite and periodic
along the Matsubara's axis, but Wick-rotated to the axis of real frequencies,
possesses infinite periodic ""chain"" of \it{second order poles} along this axis
{mukhin 2011}. This property of QOP leads to a remarkable physical consequence:
\it{QOP does not scatter anything in Minkowski world} ! Hence, the present
theory, we believe, may naturally indicate that two effects: ""hidden order""
revealed in ARPES spectra of fermi-excitations and ""neutron resonance"" feature
at finite frequency in the magnetic (bosonic) excitations spectrum in lightly
hole-doped copper oxides, could be emerging fingerprints of the Euclidian
crystal state. A peculiar manifestation of the QOP self-consistent solution in
the form of non-classical phonon states is described for an ""electromagnetic

approximately depends on the map resolution, which limits its use in
large-scale, high-resolution exploration and mapping. To alleviate this
computational difficulty, this paper presents an information-theoretic approach
to MASP (iMASP) for efficient adaptive path planning; by reformulating the
cost-minimizing iMASP as a reward-maximizing problem, its time complexity
becomes independent of map resolution and is less sensitive to increasing robot
team size as demonstrated both theoretically and empirically. Using the
reward-maximizing dual, we derive a novel adaptive variant of maximum entropy
sampling, thus improving the induced exploration policy performance. It also
allows us to establish theoretical bounds quantifying the performance advantage
of optimal adaptive over non-adaptive policies and the performance quality of
approximately optimal vs. optimal adaptive policies. We show analytically and
empirically the superior performance of iMASP-based policies for sampling the
log-Gaussian process to that of policies for the widely-used Gaussian process
in mapping the hotspot field. Lastly, we provide sufficient conditions that,
when met, guarantee adaptivity has no benefit under an assumed environment
model.

differential and the local intrinsic distance structures coincide; (ii) if

geometry of the non-weak-upper-semicontinuity set of $A$.

distance completely determines the absolute minimizer of the corresponding
$L^\infty$-variational problem, and then obtain the existence and uniqueness
for given boundary data. We also give an example of a diffusion matrix $A$ for
which there is an absolute minimizer that is not of class $C^1$. When $A$ is

calculations reproduced the overall trend of the asymmetric mass distribution
without parameter adjustment for the first time using the Langevin approach.
The Langevin trajectories show a complicated time evolution on the potential
surface, which causes the time delay of fission, showing that dynamical
treatment is vital. It was found that the shell effect of the potential energy
landscape has a dominant role in determining the mass distribution, although it
is rather insensitive to the strength of dissipation. Nevertheless, it is
essential to include the effect of dissipation, since it has a crucial role in
giving ""fluctuation"" to Langevin trajectories as well as for explaining the
multiplicities of pre-scission neutrons as the excitation energy increases.
Therefore, the present approach can serve as a basis for more refined analysis.

sections, the impact of dierent e-CO cross section for Cameron band production

Cameron band, followed by electron and photon impact dissociation of CO2. The
overhead intensities of CO Cameron band and CO2+ UV doublet emissions are about
a factor of 2 higher in solar maximum than those in solar minimum condition.
The effect of solar EUV flux models on the emission intensity is ~30-40% in

(1216A) is well known to correlate with the dust emission at 100 um. However,
it has been claimed that the FUV continuum background ""shortward"" of Ly-alpha
shows very weak or no correlation with the 100 um emission. In this paper, the
observational data of the diffuse FUV radiation by the Far Ultraviolet
Spectroscopic Explorer is reexamined in order to investigate the correlation
between the diffuse FUV radiation shortward of Ly-alpha and the 100 um
emission. Large fluctuations were confirmed in the linear-linear correlation
plots, but good correlations were found in the log-log plots. The large
fluctuations in the linear-linear plots, and thus poor correlations, between
the FUV and 100 um intensities were attributed to the lognormal property of the
FUV intensity distribution. The standard deviation of the intensity
distribution of the FUV radiation shortward of Ly-alpha was found to be
sigma_log I = 0.16-0.25. The result is consistent with that obtained not only
for the FUV radiation longward of 1216A, but also with the dust column density
measurements of various molecular clouds. This implies that most of the diffuse
FUV radiation shortward of Ly-alpha is dust-scattered light in the turbulent
interstellar medium. The diffuse FUV data obtained from the Voyager missions
was also investigated. However, much wider random fluctuations were found
compared with the FUSE data, which is most likely due to the systematic
difficulties in data reduction of the Voyager data.

  We study the chemical and kinematic properties of roughly a thousand spectra
of faint magnitude foreground Galactic stars observed serendipitously during
extra-galactic surveys in four lines-of-sight: three in the southern Galactic
hemisphere (surveys of the Carina, Fornax and Sculptor dwarf spheroidal
galaxies) and one in the northern Galactic hemisphere (a survey of the Sextans
dwarf spheroidal galaxy). The foreground stars span distances up to 3kpc from
the Galactic plane and Galactocentric radii up to 11kpc.
  Only three lines-of-sight have a sufficient number of foreground stars for a
robust analysis. Towards Sextans in the Northern Galactic hemisphere and
Sculptor in the South, we measure a consistent decrease in mean metallicity
with height from the Galactic plane, suggesting a chemically symmetric thick
disc. This decrease can either be due to an intrinsic thick disc metallicity
gradient, or simply due to a change in the thin disc/thick disc population
ratio and no intrinsic metallicity gradients for the thick disc. We favour the
latter explanation. In contrast, we find evidence of an unpredicted metal-poor
population in the direction of Carina. This population was earlier detected by
Wyse et al. (2006), but our more detailed analysis provides robust estimates of
its location (|Z|<1kpc), metallicity (-2<[M/H]<-1 dex) and azimuthal orbital
velocity (V_phi ~120 km/s).
  Given the chemo-dynamical properties of the over-density towards the Carina
line-of-sight, we suggest that it represents the metal-poor tail of the
canonical thick disc. In spite of the small number of stars available, we
suggest that this metal-weak thick disc follows the often suggested thick disc
velocity-metallicity correlation of dV_phi/d[M/H]~40-50km/s/dex.

from devices equipped with sensing capabilities, cloud computing emerges as a
scalable and cost-effective platform to store and manage the data. While
benefits of cloud computing are numerous, security concerns arising when data
and computation are outsourced to a third party still hinder the complete
movement to the cloud. In this paper, we focus on the problem of data privacy
on the cloud, particularly on access controls over stream data. The nature of
stream data and the complexity of sharing data make access control a more
challenging issue than in traditional archival databases. We present
Streamforce - a system allowing data owners to securely outsource their data to
the cloud. The owner specifies fine-grained policies which are enforced by the
cloud. The latter performs most of the heavy computations, while learning
nothing about the data. To this end, we employ a number of encryption schemes,
including deterministic encryption, proxy-based attribute based encryption and
sliding-window encryption. In Streamforce, access control policies are modeled
as secure continuous queries, which entails minimal changes to existing stream
processing engines, and allows for easy expression of a wide-range of policies.
In particular, Streamforce comes with a number of secure query operators
including Map, Filter, Join and Aggregate. Finally, we implement Streamforce
over an open source stream processing engine (Esper) and evaluate its
performance on a cloud platform. The results demonstrate practical performance
for many real-world applications, and although the security overhead is
visible, Streamforce is highly scalable.

deployment of a very large number of antenna elements at the base stations. The
gains from massive MIMO communication come from the use of multi-user MIMO on

station compared to the number of served users. Initial work on massive MIMO
did not fully address several practical issues associated with its deployment.
This paper considers the impact of channel aging on the performance of massive
MIMO systems. The effects of channel variation are characterized as a function
of different system parameters assuming a simple model for the channel time
variations at the transmitter. Channel prediction is proposed to overcome
channel aging effects. The analytical results on aging show how capacity is
lost due to time variation in the channel. Numerical results in a multicell
network show that massive MIMO works even with some channel variation and that
channel prediction could partially overcome channel aging effects.

to investigate the relationship between redshifts derived from optical
spectroscopy and neutral hydrogen (HI) spectral line observations. We find that
the two redshift measurements agree well, with a negligible systematic offset
and a small distribution width. Employing simple simulations, we determine how
the width of an ideal stacked HI profile depends on these redshift offsets, as
well as larger redshift errors more appropriate for high redshift galaxy
surveys. The width of the stacked profile is dominated by the width
distribution of the input individual profiles when the redshift errors are less
than the median width of the input profiles, and only when the redshift errors
become large, ~150 km/s, do they significantly affect the width of the stacked
profile. This redshift accuracy can be achieved with moderate resolution
optical spectra. We provide guidelines for the number of spectra required for
stacking to reach a specified mass sensitivity, given telescope and survey
parameters, which will be useful for planning optical spectroscopy observing

LC resonator generating a SQUID plasma mode. Higher-order red and blue
sidebands were observed in a simple measurement scheme because the resonant
energy of the resonator, 600 MHz, was comparable to the thermal energy. We also
observed Rabi oscillations on the carrier transition and the first-order
sideband transitions. Because the qubit was coupled to a single arm of the dc
SQUID, the qubit-SQUID coupling was significant at zero bias current, where
these phenomena were observed. The ratios between the Rabi periods for the

the Rayleigh phonon dispersion could drive the electron-electron interaction
attractive at low frequencies. However, the average pairing interaction within

probability by limiting the interference created by underlaid D2D users, while
also attempting to support as many D2D links as possible. For the distributed
power control method, expressions for the coverage probabilities of cellular

provided. The analysis reveals the impact of key system parameters on the
network performance. For example, the bottleneck of D2D underlaid cellular

line. Taking advantage of the large amount of data available in the COSMOS
field, the properties of the [NeV]-selected Type-2 AGN have been investigated,
focusing on their host galaxies, X-ray emission, and optical line flux ratios.
Finally, the diagnostic developed by Gilli et al. (2010), based on the X-ray to
[NeV] luminosity ratio, has been exploited to search for the more heavily
obscured AGN. We found that [Ne v]-selected narrow line AGN have Seyfert 2-like
optical spectra, although with emission line ratios diluted by a star-forming
component. The ACS morphologies and stellar component in the optical spectra
indicate a preference for our Type-2 AGN to be hosted in early-spirals with
stellar masses greater than 10^(9.5-10)Msun, on average higher than those of
the galaxy parent sample. The fraction of galaxies hosting [NeV]-selected
obscured AGN increases with the stellar mass, reaching a maximum of about 3% at
2x10^11 Msun. A comparison with other selection techniques at z~1 shows that
the detection of the [Ne v] line is an effective method to select AGN in the
optical band, in particular the most heavily obscured ones, but can not provide
by itself a complete census of AGN2. Finally, the high fraction of
[NeV]-selected Type-2 AGN not detected in medium-deep Chandra observations
(67%) is suggestive of the inclusion of Compton-thick sources in our sample.
The presence of a population of heavily obscured AGN is corroborated by the
X-ray to [NeV] ratio; we estimated, by mean of X-ray stacking technique and
simulations, that the Compton-thick fraction in our sample of Type-2 AGN is
43+-4%, in good agreement with standard assumptions by the XRB synthesis
models.

classical world emerges from quantum mechanics. Their dynamics preserves
(practically) quantum linearity for microscopic systems, while it becomes
strongly nonlinear when moving towards macroscopic scale. The conventional
approach to test collapse models is to create spatial superpositions of
mesoscopic systems and then examine the loss of interference, while
environmental noises are engineered carefully. Here we investigate a different
approach: We study systems that naturally oscillate --creating quantum
superpositions-- and thus represent a natural case-study for testing quantum
linearity: neutrinos, neutral mesons, and chiral molecules. We will show how
spontaneous collapses affect their oscillatory behavior, and will compare them
with environmental decoherence effects. We will show that, contrary to what
previously predicted, collapse models cannot be tested with neutrinos. The
effect is stronger for neutral mesons, but still beyond experimental reach.
Instead, chiral molecules can offer promising candidates for testing collapse
models.

constant alpha. Controversial results that have been published in last years
suggest that in addition to to wavelength calibration problems systematic
errors might arise because of insufficient spectral resolution. The aim of this
work is to estimate the impact of incorrect line decompositions in fitting
procedures due to asymmetric line profiles. Methods are developed to
distinguish between different sources of line position shifts and thus to
minimize error sources in future work. To simulate asymmetric line profiles,
two different methods were used. At first the profile was created as an
unresolved blend of narrow lines and then, the profile was created using a
macroscopic velocity field of the absorbing medium. The simulated spectra were
analysed with standard methods to search for apparent shifts of line positions
that would mimic a variation of fundamental constants. Differences between
position shifts due to an incorrect line decomposition and a real variation of
constants were probed using methods that have been newly developed or adapted
for this kind of analysis. The results were then applied to real data. Apparent
relative velocity shifts of several hundred meters per second are found in the
analysis of simulated spectra with asymmetric line profiles. It was found that
each system has to be analysed in detail to distinguish between different
sources of line position shifts. A set of 16 FeII systems in seven quasar
spectra was analysed. With the methods developed, the mean alpha variation that
appeared in these systems was reduced from the original

compared the data to a new grid of hydrostatic PHOENIX model atmospheres.
  In our visibility data, we observe molecular layers of water and CO in
extended atmospheres. For a uniform disk modeling, we observe size increases at
the water band of 10% to 25% and at the CO bandheads of 20%-35% with respect to
the near continuum bandpass. The PHOENIX atmosphere models predict the spectra
and the continuum visibility values, but cannot reproduce the large extensions
of the molecular layers. This indicates that the opacities of the molecular
bands are included, but that the model atmospheres are too compact compared to
the observations. The observed extended layers may be levitated by processes
such as pulsation or convection, which are not included in the hydrostatic
atmospheric models. Comparing the continuum visibility values to PHOENIX
models, we estimate the Rosseland-mean photospheric angular diameters. Together
with the distance and the spectro-photometry, we calculate radii and effective
temperatures. The location of the targets in the HR-diagram is confirmed to be
close to, and possibly slightly to the right of, the Hayashi limit of recent
evolutionary tracks corresponding to masses between about 20 Msun and 40 Msun

NBG, Chiron is equipped with a type system, lambda notation, and definite and
indefinite description. The type system includes a universal type, dependent
types, dependent function types, subtypes, and possibly empty types. Unlike
traditional logics such as first-order logic and simple type theory, Chiron
admits undefined terms that result, for example, from a function applied to an
argument outside its domain or from an improper definite or indefinite
description. The most noteworthy part of Chiron is its facility for reasoning
about the syntax of expressions. Quotation is used to refer to a set called a
construction that represents the syntactic structure of an expression, and
evaluation is used to refer to the value of the expression that a construction
represents. Using quotation and evaluation, syntactic side conditions, schemas,
syntactic transformations used in deduction and computation rules, and other
such things can be directly expressed in Chiron. This paper presents the syntax
and semantics of Chiron, some definitions and simple examples illustrating its
use, a proof system for Chiron, and a notion of an interpretation of one theory

higher absorption in the crystalline silicon than the conventional micron-scale

coupling of holes in the $\sigma$ band not only to the $\pi$ electrons of

presence of such kinks for graphene on several different substrates that all
show a strong coupling constant of lambda=1.

Fisher information naturally pops up in the expression of the derivative of the
Tsallis entropy. This generalized Fisher information also appears as a special
case of a generalized Fisher information for estimation problems. Indeed, we
derive here a new Cram\'er-Rao inequality for the estimation of a parameter,
which involves a generalized form of Fisher information. This generalized
Fisher information reduces to the standard Fisher information as a particular
case. In the case of a translation parameter, the general Cram\'er-Rao
inequality leads to an inequality for distributions which is saturated by
generalized $q$-Gaussian distributions. These generalized $q$-Gaussians are
important in several areas of physics and mathematics. They are known to
maximize the $q$-entropies subject to a moment constraint. The Cram\'er-Rao
inequality shows that the generalized $q$-Gaussians also minimize the
generalized Fisher information among distributions with a fixed moment.
Similarly, the generalized $q$-Gaussians also minimize the generalized Fisher
information among distributions with a given $q$-entropy.

products against a family of measurement vectors has been well studied in
mathematics and engineering. A generalization of this phase retrieval problem
also exists in engineering: recovering a vector from measurements consisting of
norms of its orthogonal projections onto a family of subspaces. There exist
semidefinite programming algorithms to solve this problem, but much remains
unknown for this more general case. Can families of subspaces for which such
measurements are injective be completely classified? What is the minimal number
of subspaces required to have injectivity? How closely does this problem
compare to the usual phase retrieval problem with families of measurement
vectors? In this paper, we answer or make incremental steps toward these
questions. We provide several characterizations of subspaces which yield
injective measurements, and through a concrete construction, we prove the
surprising result that phase retrieval can be achieved with $2M-1$ projections
of arbitrary rank in $\HH_M$.
  Finally we present several open problems as we discuss issues unique to the
phase retrieval problem with subspaces.

  We study proton Compton scattering in the first resonance region in an

and $\Delta^+$ are naturally unified in the generalized Rarita-Schwinger theory
proposed by Savvidy. We introduce six non-minimal electromagnetic
interactions--with their coefficients being called ""form factors""--and bare
polarizabilities in an effective Lagrangian. We express proton and Delta
magnetic moments and the electromagnetic polarizabilities in terms of the bare
polarizabilities and the form factors. We fit the form factors and bare
polarizabilities using experimental data and derive Delta magnetic moment from
the best fit values of the parameters.
  Then I present our joint work with adviser Dr. Gang Chen on the study of
boundary behavior of off-shell Yang-Mills amplitudes with a pair of external
momenta complexified. In Feynman gauge, we introduce a set of ""reduced
vertices"" which can capture the boundary behavior up to the first two leading
orders. We then prove a theorem on permutation sum for a given color ordering,
and use it to analyze the boundary behavior of amplitudes with two non-adjacent
legs complexified. Then we construct off-shell Britto-Cachazo-Feng-Witten
(BCFW) recursion relations and study relations between off-shell amplitudes.
  Finally, we study the recursion relations for off-shell Yang-Mills amplitudes
at tree and one loop levels as deduced from imposing complexified Ward

communities in networks. Communities are successively merged into larger
communities, coarsening a network of actors into a more manageable network of
communities. The order in which merges should occur is not in general clear,
necessitating heuristics for selecting pairs of communities to merge. We
describe a hierarchical clustering algorithm based on a local optimality
property. For each edge in the network, we associate the modularity change for
merging the communities it links. For each community vertex, we call the
preferred edge that edge for which the modularity change is maximal. When an
edge is preferred by both vertices that it links, it appears to be the optimal
choice from the local viewpoint. We use the locally optimal edges to define the
algorithm: simultaneously merge all pairs of communities that are connected by
locally optimal edges that would increase the modularity, redetermining the
locally optimal edges after each step and continuing so long as the modularity
can be further increased. We apply the algorithm to model and empirical
networks, demonstrating that it can efficiently produce high-quality community
solutions. We relate the performance and implementation details to the
structure of the resulting community hierarchies. We additionally consider a
complementary local clustering algorithm, describing how to identify
overlapping communities based on the local optimality condition.

for analyzing drug resistance mutations. Several authors have used arguments
based on extreme value theory in their work on adaptation. There are
complications with these approaches if fitness is additive (meaning that
fitness effects of mutations sum), or whenever there is more additivity than
what one would expect in an uncorrelated fitness landscape. However, the
approaches have been used in published work, even in situations with
substantial amounts of additivity. In particular, extreme value theory has been
used in discussions on evolutionary predictability. We say that evolution is
predictable if the use of a particular drug at different locations tends lead
to the same resistance mutations. Evolutionary predictability depends on the
probabilities of mutational trajectories. Arguments about probabilities based
on extreme value theory can be misleading. Additivity may cause errors in
estimates of the probabilities of some mutational trajectories by a factor 20
even for rather small examples. We show that additivity gives systematic errors
so as to exaggerate the differences between the most and the least likely
trajectory. As a result of this bias, evolution may appear more predictable
than it is. From a broader perspective, our results suggest that approaches
which depend on the Orr-Gillespie theory are likely to give misleading results
for realistic fitness landscapes whenever one considers adaptation in several
steps.

outflow already detected in the UV. Provided the gas density estimated in the
UV, the outflow is consistent to be located in the host galaxy, at ~ kpc scale.
Narrow emission lines were detected in the X-rays, in the UV and also in the

narrow lines emission, indicating that the narrow line region is probably a
stratified environment, differing in density and ionization. X-ray lines are
unambiguously produced in a more highly ionized gas phase than the one emitting
the UV lines. The analysis suggests also that the X-ray emitter may be just a
deeper portion of the same gas layer producing the UV lines. Optical lines are
probably produced in another, disconnected gas system. The different ionization

single-particle potential is constructed by means of a complex-valued in-medium
loop that includes corrections from a test-particle of momentum $\vec p$ added
to the filled Fermi sea. The single-particle potential $U(k_f,k_f)$ at the
Fermi surface as obtained from the resummation of the combined particle and

perturbative contributions at various orders $a^n$ in the scattering length are
deduced and checked against the known analytical results at order $a^1$ and

momentum dependence of the real (and imaginary) single-particle potential is
found. This indicates an instability against a phase transition to a state with
an empty shell inside the Fermi sphere such that the density gets reduced by
about 5%. For comparison, the same analysis is performed for the resummed
particle-particle ladder diagrams alone. In this truncation an instability for
hole-excitations near the Fermi surface is found at strong coupling. For the

is a spectrally positive L\'evy process with finite variation, and Z_n^M is the
counting process of marks in {0,1} carried by the jumps of Z_n. The study of
these processes is justified by their interpretation as contour processes of a
sequence of splitting trees with mutations at birth. Indeed, this paper is the
first part of a work aiming to establish an invariance principle for the
genealogies of such populations enriched with their mutational histories. To
this aim, we define a bivariate subordinator that we call the marked ladder
height process of (Z_n,Z_n^M), as a generalization of the classical ladder
height process to our L\'evy processes with marked jumps. Assuming that the
sequence (Z_n) converges towards a L\'evy process Z with infinite variation, we
first prove the convergence in distribution, with two possible regimes for the
marks, of the marked ladder height process of (Z_n,Z_n^M). Then we prove the
joint convergence in law of Z_n with its local time at the supremum and its
marked ladder height process.

in strongly scattering media. It enables diffraction-limited focusing and
imaging at depths where conventional microscopy techniques fail. However, while
most wavefront-shaping works to-date exploited direct access to the target or
implanted probes, the challenge is to apply it non-invasively inside complex
samples. Ultrasonic-tagging techniques have been recently demonstrated but
these require a sequential point-by- point acquisition, a major drawback for
imaging applications. Here, we introduce a novel approach to non-invasively
measure the optical transmission-matrix inside a scattering medium, exploiting
the photo-acoustic effect. Our approach allows for the first time to
simultaneously discriminate, localize, and selectively focus light on multiple
targets inside a scattering sample, as well as to recover and exploit the
scattering medium properties. Combining the powerful approach of the
transmission-matrix with the advantages of photoacoustic imaging opens the path
towards deep-tissue imaging and light-delivery utilizing endogenous optical
contrast.

Here we investigate this stochastic phenomenon by analysing the plastic

microcompression tests on identically fabricated Cu single crystalline
micropillars. We find that a characteristic yield stress can be defined in the
average sense for a given specimen ensemble, where the average and the variance
of the plastic strain start to increase considerably. In addition, in all
studied cases the stress values at a given strain follow a Weibull distribution
with similar Weibull exponents, which suggests that dislocation-mediated
plastic yielding is characterized by an underlying weakest-link phenomenon.
These results are found not to depend on fine details of the actual set-up,

as the large N version of the ordinary lattice gauge model on a $V=L^4$

quantities in this model and in the $k$=0 model (corresponding to periodic

$L$ for which the symmetry is also unbroken in the pure gauge case. In
particular, the $k=0$ model, studied recently by several authors, shows a large
and irregular dependence on $N$ within our region of parameters. This makes
this reduced model very impractical for extracting physical information about
the large N lattice theory. On the contrary, the model for $N=289=17^2$ and
large enough $k$ gives consistent results, even for extended observables as
Wilson loops $W(R,T)$ up to $R,T$=8, matching the expected behaviour for the

scheme to improve system performance, especially for cell-edge users. In this
work, we use stochastic geometry to analyze cooperation models where the
positions of Base Stations (BSs) follow a Poisson point process distribution
and where Voronoi cells define the planar areas associated with them. For the
service of each user, either one or two BSs are involved. If two, these
cooperate by exchange of user data and channel related information with
conferencing over some backhaul link. Our framework generally allows variable
levels of channel information at the transmitters. In this paper we investigate
the case of limited channel state information for cooperation (channel phase,
second neighbour interference), but not the fully adaptive case which would
require considerable feedback. The total per-user transmission power is further
split between the two transmitters and a common message is encoded. The
decision for a user to choose service with or without cooperation is directed
by a family of geometric policies depending on its relative position to its two
closest base stations. An exact expression of the network coverage probability
is derived. Numerical evaluation allows one to analyze significant coverage
benefits compared to the non-cooperative case. As a conclusion, cooperation
schemes can improve system performance without exploitation of extra network
resources.

means that, although the citation-based scores could help to describe

of the ureteric bud from the Wolffian duct, its invasion into the mesenchyme,
and the observed branching pattern. The model also recapitulates all relevant
protein expression patterns in wild-type and mutant mice. The lung and kidney
models are both based on a particular receptor- ligand interaction and require:
(1) cooperative binding of ligand and receptor, (2) a lower diffusion
coefficient for the receptor than for the ligand, and (3) an increase in the
receptor concentration in response to receptor-ligand binding (by enhanced
transcription, more recycling or similar). These conditions are met also by
other receptor-ligand systems. We propose that ligand-receptor based Turing
patterns represent a general mechanism to control branching morphogenesis and

discrete dipole approximation to calculate scattering and absorption of
electromagnetic waves by targets with arbitrary geometries and complex
refractive index. The targets may be isolated entities (e.g., dust particles),
but may also be 1-d or 2-d periodic arrays of ""target unit cells"", allowing
calculation of absorption, scattering, and electric fields around arrays of
nanostructures.
  The theory of the DDA and its implementation in DDSCAT is presented in Draine
(1988) and Draine & Flatau (1994), and its extension to periodic structures in
Draine & Flatau (2008), and efficient near-field calculations in Flatau &
Draine (2012). DDSCAT 7.3 includes support for MPI, OpenMP, and the Intel Math
Kernel Library (MKL). DDSCAT supports calculations for a variety of target
geometries. Target materials may be both inhomogeneous and anisotropic. It is
straightforward for the user to ""import"" arbitrary target geometries into the
code. DDSCAT automatically calculates total cross sections for absorption and
scattering and selected elements of the Mueller scattering intensity matrix for
user-specified scattering directions. DDSCAT 7.3 can efficiently calculate E
and B throughout a user-specified volume containing the target.
  This User Guide explains how to use DDSCAT 7.3 to carry out electromagnetic
scattering calculations, including use of DDPOSTPROCESS, a Fortran-90 code to
perform calculations with E and B at user-selected locations near the target. A
number of changes have been made since the last release, DDSCAT 7.2 .

  Technological, Organizational, and Geographic Attributes of Firms","accepted for publication in Scientometrics (October, 2013)",,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Using the possible synergy among geographic, size, and technological
distributions of firms in the Orbis database, we find the greatest reduction of
uncertainty at the level of the 31 provinces of China, and an additional 18.0%
at the national level. Some of the coastal provinces stand out as expected, but
the metropolitan areas of Beijing and Shanghai are (with Tianjan and Chonqing)
most pronounced at the next-lower administrative level of (339) prefectures,
since these four metropoles are administratively defined at both levels.
Focusing on high- and medium-tech manufacturing, a shift toward Beijing and
Shanghai is indicated, and the synergy is on average enhanced (as expected; but
not for all provinces). Unfortunately, the Orbis data is incomplete since it
was collected for commercial and not for administrative or governmental
purposes. However, we show a methodology that can be used by others who may
have access to higher-quality statistical data for the measurement.

  Compton's quantum theory of scattering of radiation","18 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A quantum theory of scattering of radiation by a stationary free electron
based on photon conception and relativistic kinematics, applying the principles
of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum was proposed by Compton
to explain the scattering of X-rays and {\gamma}-rays by light elements. The
relativistic differential cross-section for the Compton scattering of a photon
by a stationary free electron was formulated by Klein and Nishina using Dirac's
relativistic theory of electrons, and has been verified experimentally, when
the binding energy of the electron is negligible compared to the incident
photon energy. Here we show that the energy of scattered photons, and kinetic
energy of recoiled electrons obtained from Compton's quantum theory of
scattering of radiation, show a degree of matching (that increases with the
increase of incident photon energy as quantified by chi-square test) with the
differential Klein-Nishina electronic cross section per electron per unit solid
angle for the scattering of an unpolarized photon by a stationary free electron
when appropriate normalizations are invoked. There is a high degree of matching
in a regime where the total electronic Klein-Nishina cross section for the
Compton scattering on a free stationary electron scales as the inverse of the
incident photon energy and the contribution of the electro-magnetic interaction
to differential electronic cross section diminishes. Our results have
significant implications to the foundations of quantum mechanics and to the
understanding of the mechanisms of photon-electron interactions in the Compton
scattering.

cortex seems to use such stochastic multi-scale periodic `grid codes' to

this finding also hold for neurons that are not statistically independent? To
assess the extent to which biological grid codes are subject to statistical

reach 0.8. For increasing mismatches between the grids of the two neurons, the

nonthermal coronal electrons stopping in the chromosphere, or remaining trapped
in the corona. The collisional thick target model (CTTM) predicts that sources
produced by harder power-law injection spectra should appear further down the
legs or footpoints of a flare loop. Therefore, hardening of the injected
power-law electron spectrum during flare onset should be concurrent with a
descending hard X-ray source.
  Aims: To test this implication of the CTTM by comparing its predicted HXR
source locations with those derived from observations of a solar flare which
exhibits a nonthermally-dominated spectrum before the peak in HXRs, known as an
early impulsive event.
  Methods: HXR images and spectra of an early impulsive C-class flare were
obtained using the Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI).
Images were reconstructed to produce HXR source height evolutions for three
energy bands. Spatially-integrated spectral analysis was performed to isolate
nonthermal emission, and to determine the power-law index of the electron
injection spectrum. The observed height-time evolutions were then fit with
CTTM-based simulated heights for each energy.
  Results: A good match between model and observed source heights was reached,
requiring a density model that agreed well with previous studies of flare loop
densities.
  Conclusions: The CTTM has been used to produce a descent of model HXR source
heights that compares well with observations of this event. Based on this
interpretation, downward motion of nonthermal sources should indeed occur in
any flare where there is spectral hardening in the electron distribution during
a flare. However, this would often be masked by thermal emission associated
with flare plasma pre-heating.

heteroclinic manifolds are foliated by heteroclinic connections between $C^0$

prove the persistence of these objects under perturbation. In addition, we
provide sufficient conditions of the existence of transversal heteroclinic

The heteroclinic manifolds allow us to define the {\em scattering map}, which
links asymptotic dynamics in the invariant manifolds through heteroclinic
connections. First order properties of this map provide sufficient conditions
for the asymptotic dynamics to be located in different energy levels in the
perturbed invariant manifolds. Hence we have an essential tool for the
construction of a heteroclinic skeleton which, when followed, can lead to the
existence of Arnol'd diffusion: trajectories that, on large time scales,
destabilize the system by further accumulating energy. We validate all the

galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, along with a suite of merger
simulations, to investigate the enhancement of star formation as a function of
separation in galaxy pairs. Using a new technique for distinguishing between
the influence of nearby neighbours and larger scale environment, we find a
clear enhancement in star formation out to projected separations of ~ 150 kpc,
beyond which there is no net enhancement. We find the strongest enhancements at
the smallest separations (especially < 20 kpc), consistent with earlier work.
Similar trends are seen in the simulations, which indicate that the strongest
enhancements are produced in highly disturbed systems approaching final
coalescence, whereas the more modest enhancements seen at wider separations are
the result of starburst activity triggered at first pericentre passage, which
persists as the galaxies move to larger separations. The absence of any net
enhancement beyond 150 kpc provides reassurance that the detected enhancements
are due to galaxy-galaxy interactions, rather than larger scale environmental
effects or potential pair selection biases. A rough census indicates that 66
per cent of the enhanced star formation in our pair sample occurs at
separations > 30 kpc. We conclude that significant interaction-induced star
formation is not restricted to merger remnants or galaxies with close
companions; instead, a larger population of wider separation pairs exhibit
enhanced star formation due to recent close encounters.

electrodynamics (QED) are the O(2)xO(3) symmetric fields, originally introduced
by S.L. Adler in 1972. Those backgrounds have some instanton-like properties
and yield a one-loop effective action that is highly nontrivial, but amenable
to numerical calculation. Here, we use the recently developed
""partial-wave-cutoff method"" for a full mass range numerical analysis of the
effective action for the ""standard"" O(2)xO(3) symmetric field, modified by a
radial suppression factor. At large mass, we are able to match the asymptotics
of the physically renormalized effective action against the leading two mass
levels of the inverse mass expansion. For small masses, with a suitable choice
of the renormalization scheme we obtain stable numerical results even in the
massless limit. We analyze the N - point functions in this background and show
that, even in the absence of the radial suppression factor, the two-point
contribution to the effective action is the only obstacle to taking its
massless limit. The standard O(2)xO(3) background leads to a chiral anomaly
term in the effective action, and both our perturbative and nonperturbative
results strongly suggest that the small-mass asymptotic behavior of the
effective action is, after the subtraction of the two-point contribution,
dominated by this anomaly term as the only source of a logarithmic mass
dependence. This confirms a conjecture by M. Fry.

correlate with horizontal branch (HB) morphology, sug- gesting that dynamics
does not play a role in the second-parameter problem. However, core densities
and collision rates derived from surface-brightness may be significantly
underestimated as the surface-brightness profile of GCs is not necessarily a
good indicator of the dynamical state of GC cores. Core-collapse may go
unnoticed if high central densities of dark remnants are present. Aims. We test
whether GC HB morphology data supports a dynamical contribution to the
so-called second-parameter effect. Methods. To remove first-parameter
dependence we fitted the maximum effective temperature along the HB as a
function of metal- licity in a sample of 54 Milky Way GCs. We plotted the
residuals to the fit as a function of second-parameter candidates, namely
dynamical age and total luminosity. We considered dynamical age (i.e. the ratio
between age and half-light relaxation time) among possible second-parameters.
We used a set of direct N-body simulations, including ones with dark remnants
to illustrate how core density peaks, due to core collapse, in a dynamical-age
range similar to that in which blue HBs are overabundant with respect to the
metallicity expectation, especially for low-concentration initial conditions.
Results. GC total luminosity shows nonlinear behavior compatible with the
self-enrichment picture. However, the data are amenable to a different
interpretation based on a dynamical origin of the second-parameter effect.
Enhanced mass-stripping in the late red-giant- branch phase due to stellar
interactions in collapsing cores is a viable candidate mechanism. In this
picture, GCs with HBs bluer than expected based on metallicity are those
undergoing core-collapse.

j_* from kinematic and photometric data that extended to large radii and M_*
from near-infrared luminosities L_K with an assumed universal mass-to-light

in M_*/L_K correlated with B-V color. In the present work, we use this
correlation to estimate M_*/L_K and hence M_* from the measured B-V and L_K.
Our revised j_*--M_* diagram is similar to our previous one; both
disk-dominated and elliptical galaxies follow nearly parallel sequences with
j_* \propto M_*^\alpha\ and \alpha = 0.6 +/- 0.1. However, the offset between
the sequences is now a factor of about 5, some 30% larger than before (and

few tens of parsecs and luminosities up to 10^7 Lsun. To investigate the
formation and properties of nuclear stellar discs (NSDs), we look for their
presence in a set of N-body simulations studying the dissipationless merging of
multiple star clusters in galactic nuclei. A few tens of star clusters with
sizes and masses comparable to those of globular clusters observed in the Milky
Way are accreted onto a pre-existing nuclear stellar component: either a
massive super star cluster or a rapidly rotating, compact disc with a
scale-length of a few parsecs, mimicing the variety of observed nuclear
structures. Images and kinematic maps of the simulation time-steps are then
built and analysed as if they were real and at the distance of the Virgo
cluster. We use the Scorza-Bender method to search for the presence of disc
structures via photometric decomposition. In one case the merger remnant has
all the observed photometric and kinematic properties of NSDs observed in real
galaxies. This shows that current observations are consistent with most of the
NSD mass being assembled from the migration and accretion of star clusters into
the galactic centre. In the other simulation instead, we detect an elongated
structure from the unsharp masked image, that does not develop the photometric
or kinematic signature of a NSD. Thus, in the context of searches for a disc
structure, the Scorza-Bender method is a robust and necessary tool.

up in the final conditions. In the usual overdensity power spectrum, most
sensitive to contracting and collapsing dense regions, initial power on
slightly non-linear scales (k ~ 0.3 h/Mpc) smears to smaller scales, coming to
dominate the initial power once there. Log-density and Gaussianized-density
power spectra, sensitive to low-density (expanding) and high-density regions,
respond differently: initial spikes spread symmetrically in scale, both upward
and downward. In fact, in the power spectrum of 1/(1 + {\delta}), spikes
migrate to larger scales, showing the magnifying effect of voids on small-scale
modes. These power spectra show much greater sensitivity to small-scale initial
features. We also test the difference between an approximation of the
Ly-{\alpha} flux field, and its Gaussianized form, and give a toy model that
qualitatively explains the symmetric power spreading in Gaussianized-density
power spectra. Also, we discuss how to use this framework to estimate
power-spectrum covariance matrices. This can be used to track the fate of

at least halfway to M33. This feature has been interpreted to be the neutral
component of a condensing intergalactic filament (Dav\'e et al. 2001) which
would be able to fuel star formation in M31 and M33, but simulations suggest
that such a feature could also result from an interaction between both galaxies
within the past few billion years (Bekki 2008). Here we report radio
observations showing that about 50 per cent percent of this gas is composed of
clouds, while the rest is distributed in an extended, diffuse component. The
clouds have velocities comparable to those of M31 and M33, and have properties
suggesting they are unrelated to other Local Group objects. We conclude that
the clouds are likely to be transient condensations of gas embedded in an
intergalactic filament and are therefore a potential source of fuel for future
star formation in M31 and M33.

a synchronous (normal operation) state, a limit cycle (power outage) and
coexistence of both. Second, we estimate stability thresholds for the
collective dynamics of small network motifs, in particular star-like networks

decentralization scenarios finding that decentralization itself may support
power grids in reaching stable synchrony for lower lines transmission

observations of CSS sources. About half of the sources are point-like even at
the resolution of about 0.1x0.1 arcseconds. The remaining sources have double
or triple structure. Low values for the percentage of polarised emission in CSS
sources is confirmed. On the average, quasars are more polarised than galaxies.
A wide range of RM values have been measured. There are clear indications of
very large RMs up to 5\,585 rad m**(-2). CSS galaxies are characterized by RM
values that are larger than CSS quasars. The majority of the objects show very
large values of RM. Conclusions - The available data on sub-arcsecond-scale
rest-frame RM estimates for CSS sources show that these have a wide range of
values extending up to about 36,000 rad m**(-2). RM estimates indicate an
overall density of the magneto-ionic medium larger than classical radio

1-component modified black bodies fit the dust emission longward of 80um very
well (median beta=1.83) the degeneracy between dust temp & beta also means that
the SEDs are very well described by a dust emissivity index fixed at beta=2 and
10<T<25 K. Although a second, warmer dust component is required to fit shorter
wavelength data, & contributes ~1/3 of the total infrared emission, its mass is
negligible. No evidence is found for a very cold (6-10 K) dust component. The
temp of the cold dust component is strongly influenced by the ratio of the star
formation rate to the total dust mass. This implies, contrary to what is often
assumed, that a significant fraction of even the emission from ~20 K dust is
powered by ongoing star formation, whether or not the dust itself is associated
with star forming clouds or `cirrus'. There is statistical evidence of a
free-free contribution to the 217GHz flux densities of <20%. We find a median
dust-to-stellar mass ratio of 0.0046; & that this ratio is anti-correlated with
galaxy mass. There is good correlation between dust mass & atomic gas mass
(median M_d/M_HI = 0.022), suggesting that galaxies that have more dust have
more interstellar medium in general. Our derived dust mass function implies a
mean dust mass density of the local Universe (for dust within galaxies), of
7.0+-1.4 x 10^5 M_solar/Mpc, significantly greater than that found in the most

to those that are simultaneously in the Kozai resonance. In addition to the
normal 3:2 resonant argument libration, Kozai plutinos also show periodic
oscillations in eccentricity and inclination, coupled to the argument of
perihelion (omega) oscillation. Due to the mean-motion resonance, plutinos
avoid coming to pericenter near Neptune's current position in the ecliptic
plane. Because Kozai plutinos are restricted to certain values of omega,
perihelion always occurs out of the ecliptic plane, biasing ecliptic surveys
against finding these objects. The observed Kozai plutino fraction (fkoz) has
been measured by several surveys, finding values between 8% and 25%, while the
true fkoz has been predicted to be between 10% and 30% by different giant
planet migration simulations. We show that the observed fkoz varies widely

find the true ratio is complex. Even a survey that covers most or all of the

star-forming activity, as parametrized by their sSFR, across a redshift range
up to z=2.
  Its slope shows irrelevant evolution in the passive sample, being steeper in
groups than in clusters. However, the sub-sample of high-mass passive galaxies
only is characterized by a steep increase of the slope with redshift, from
which it can be inferred that the bulk of the slope evolution of the ZM
relation is driven by the more massive passive objects. (...ABRIDGED...)
  The ZM relation for the star-forming sample reveals an increasing scatter
with redshift, indicating that it is still being built at early epochs. The
star-forming galaxies make up a tight sequence in the SFR-M_* plane at high
redshift, whose scatter increases with time alongside with the consolidation of
the passive sequence. We also confirm the anti-correlation between sSFR and
stellar mass, pointing at a key role of the former in determining the galaxy
downsizing, as the most significant means of diagnostics of the star formation
efficiency. Likewise, an anti-correlation between sSFR and metallicity can be
established for the star-forming galaxies, while on the contrary more active
galaxies in terms of simple SFR are also metal-richer.
  We discuss these results in terms of the mechanisms driving the evolution
within the high- and low-mass regimes at different epochs: mergers,
feedback-driven outflows and the intrinsic variation of the star formation
efficiency.

patterns. The salient and interesting features that the complex network study
offer in comparison to graph theory are the emphasis on the dynamical
properties of the networks and the ability of inherently uncovering pattern
formation of the vertices. In this paper, we present a hybrid data
classification technique combining a low level and a high level classifier. The
low level term can be equipped with any traditional classification techniques,
which realize the classification task considering only physical features (e.g.,
geometrical or statistical features) of the input data. On the other hand, the
high level term has the ability of detecting data patterns with semantic
meanings. In this way, the classification is realized by means of the
extraction of the underlying network's features constructed from the input
data. As a result, the high level classification process measures the
compliance of the test instances with the pattern formation of the training
data. Out of various high level perspectives that can be utilized to capture
semantic meaning, we utilize the dynamical features that are generated from a
tourist walker in a networked environment. Specifically, a weighted combination
of transient and cycle lengths generated by the tourist walk is employed for
that end. Interestingly, our study shows that the proposed technique is able to
further improve the already optimized performance of traditional classification
techniques.

observations of solar flares with an approximate C8 GOES class. Our constraint
on peak GOES SXR flux allows for the investigation of correlations between
various flare parameters. We show that the the duration of the decay phase of a
flare is proportional to the duration of its rise phase. Additionally, we show
significant correlations between the radiation emitted in the flare rise and
decay phases. These results suggest that the total radiated energy of a given
flare is proportional to the energy radiated during the rise phase alone. This
partitioning of radiated energy between the rise and decay phases is observed
in both SXR and EUV wavelengths. Though observations from the EVE show
significant variation in the behavior of individual EUV spectral lines during
different C8 events, this work suggests that broadband EUV emission is well
constrained. Furthermore, GOES and AIA data, allow us to determine several
thermal parameters (e.g. temperature, volume, density, and emission measure)
for the flares within our sample. Analysis of these parameters demonstrate
that, within this constrained GOES class, the longer duration solar flares are
cooler events with larger volumes capable of emitting vast amounts of
radiation. The shortest C8 flares are typically the hottest events, smaller in
physical size, and have lower associated total energies. These relationships
are directly comparable with several scaling laws and flare loop models.

We obtain
an exact polynomial-time algorithm for $\gamma$-stable Max Cut instances with
$\gamma \geq c\sqrt{\log n}\log\log n$ for some absolute constant $c > 0$. Our
algorithm is robust: it never returns an incorrect answer; if the instance is
$\gamma$-stable, it finds the maximum cut, otherwise, it either finds the
maximum cut or certifies that the instance is not $\gamma$-stable. We prove
that there is no robust polynomial-time algorithm for $\gamma$-stable instances
of Max Cut when $\gamma < \alpha_{SC}(n/2)$, where $\alpha_{SC}$ is the best
approximation factor for Sparsest Cut with non-uniform demands.
  Our algorithm is based on semidefinite programming. We show that the standard
SDP relaxation for Max Cut (with $\ell_2^2$ triangle inequalities) is integral
if $\gamma \geq D_{\ell_2^2\to \ell_1}(n)$, where $D_{\ell_2^2\to \ell_1}(n)$
is the least distortion with which every $n$ point metric space of negative
type embeds into $\ell_1$. On the negative side, we show that the SDP
relaxation is not integral when $\gamma < D_{\ell_2^2\to \ell_1}(n/2)$.
Moreover, there is no tractable convex relaxation for $\gamma$-stable instances
of Max Cut when $\gamma < \alpha_{SC}(n/2)$. That suggests that solving
$\gamma$-stable instances with $\gamma =o(\sqrt{\log n})$ might be difficult or
impossible.
  Our results significantly improve previously known results. The best
previously known algorithm for $\gamma$-stable instances of Max Cut required
that $\gamma \geq c\sqrt{n}$ (for some $c > 0$) [Bilu, Daniely, Linial, and

variability on timescales down to ~15s, significantly shorter than the minute
scale variability typically found in previous observations of moss, therefore
challenging the conclusion of moss being heated in a mostly steady manner.
These rapid variability moss regions are located at the footpoints of bright
hot coronal loops observed by SDO/AIA in the 94A channel, and by Hinode/XRT.
The configuration of these loops is highly dynamic, and suggestive of slipping
reconnection. We interpret these events as signatures of heating events
associated with reconnection occurring in the overlying hot coronal loops,
i.e., coronal nanoflares. We estimate the order of magnitude of the energy in
these events to be of at least a few $10^{23}rg, also supporting the nanoflare

satisfied. Unsatisfiable-core approaches to solving soft constraint problems in
Boolean Satisfiability (e.g. MAXSAT) force all soft constraints to hold
initially. When solving fails they return an unsatisfiable core, as a set of
soft constraints that cannot hold simultaneously. Using this information the
problem is relaxed to allow certain soft constraint(s) to be violated and
solving continues. Since Lazy Clause Generation (LCG) solvers can also return
unsatisfiable cores we can adapt the MAXSAT unsatisfiable core approach to CP.

in one-dimensional Bose systems. The eigenenergy anholonomy, in which Hermitian
adiabatic cycle induces nontrivial change in eigenenergies, can be interpreted
as a manifestation of eigenenergy's Riemann surface structure, where the branch
points are identified as the exceptional points which are degeneracy points in
the complexified parameter space. It is also shown that the exceptional points
are the divergent points of the non-Abelian gauge connection for the gauge
theoretical formulation of the eigenspace anholonomy. This helps us to evaluate
anti-path-ordered exponentials of the gauge connection to obtain gauge
covariant quantities.

a natural generalization of the well-studied ski-rental problem. In the online
vertex cover problem, we are required to maintain a monotone vertex cover in a
graph whose vertices arrive online. When a vertex arrives, all its incident
edges to previously arrived vertices are revealed to the algorithm. For
bipartite graphs with the left vertices offline (i.e. all of the left vertices
arrive first before any right vertex), there are algorithms achieving the
optimal competitive ratio of $\frac{1}{1-1/e}\approx 1.582$.
  Our first result is a new optimal water-filling algorithm for this case. One
major ingredient of our result is a new charging-based analysis, which can be
generalized to attack the online fractional vertex cover problem in general
graphs. The main contribution of this paper is a 1.901-competitive algorithm
for this problem. When the underlying graph is bipartite, our fractional
solution can be rounded to an integral solution. In other words, we can obtain
a vertex cover with expected size at most 1.901 of the optimal vertex cover in
bipartite graphs.
  The next major result is a primal-dual analysis of our algorithm for the
online fractional vertex cover problem in general graphs, which implies the
dual result of a 0.526-competitive algorithm for online fractional matching in
general graphs. Notice that both problems admit a well-known 2-competitive
greedy algorithm. Our result in this paper is the first successful attempt to
beat the greedy algorithm for these two problems.
  On the hardness side, we show that no randomized online algorithm can achieve
a competitive ratio better than 1.753 and 0.625 for the online fractional
vertex cover problem and the online fractional matching problem respectively,
even for bipartite graphs.

interferometers. The platform of a co-planar interferometer can be deformed due
to driving forces and gravity. A deformed platform will induce extra components
into the geometric delay of each baseline, and change the phases of observed
visibilities. The reconstructed images will also be diluted due to the errors
of the phases. The platform deformations of The Yuan-Tseh Lee Array for
Microwave Background Anisotropy (AMiBA) were modelled based on photogrammetry
data with about 20 mount pointing positions. We then used the differential
optical pointing error between two optical telescopes to fit the model
parameters in the entire horizontal coordinate space. With the platform
deformation model, we can predict the errors of the geometric phase delays due
to platform deformation with given azimuth and elevation of the targets and
calibrators. After correcting the phases of the radio point sources in the
AMiBA interferometric data, we recover 50% - 70% flux loss due to phase errors.
This allows us to restore more than 90% of a source flux. The method outlined
in this work is not only applicable to the correction of deformation for other
co-planar telescopes but also to single dish telescopes with deformation
problems. This work also forms the basis of the upcoming science results of
AMiBA-13.

discuss the stability of a pore by relaxing the constraint of a fixed pore size

hint on how to reorganize data, but not blindly so; it gains resilience and
avoids performance bottlenecks by deliberately applying certain arbitrary
choices in its decision making. Therefore bring, adaptive indexing forward to a
mature formulation that confers the workload-robustness that previous
approaches lacked. Original cracking relies on the randomness of the workloads
to converge well. [2][3] However, where the workload is non-random, cracking
needs to introduce randomness on its own. Stochastic Cracking clearly improves
over original cracking by being robust in workload changes while maintaining
all original cracking features when it comes to adaptation. But looking at both
types of cracking, it conveyed an incomplete picture as at some point of time
it is must to know whether the workload is random or sequential. In this paper
our focus is on optimization of variant stochastic cracking, that could be
achieved in two ways either by reducing the initialization cost to make
stochastic cracking even more transparent to the user, especially for queries
that initiate a workload change and hence incur a higher cost or by combining
the strengths of the various stochastic cracking algorithms via a dynamic
component that decides which algorithm to choose for a query on the fly. The
efforts have been put in to make an algorithm that reduces the initialization
cost by using the main notion of both cracking, while considering the
requirements of adaptive indexing [2].

models is of Keller-Segel type and involves two parabolic equations, one for
the evolution of the density and one for the evolution of a mean field
potential. We classify all radial stationary solutions, prove multiplicity
results and establish some qualitative properties of these solutions, which are
characterized as critical points of an energy functional. A notion of
variational stability is associated to such solutions. The dynamical stability
in a neighborhood of a stationary solution is also studied in terms of the
spectral properties of the linearized evolution operator. For one of the two
models, we exhibit a Lyapunov functional which allows to make the link between
the two notions of stability. Even in that case, for certain values of the mass
parameter and all other parameters taken in an appropriate range, we find that
two dynamically stable stationary solutions exist. We further discuss
qualitative properties of the solutions using theoretical methods and numerical
computations.

the moon systems, single planets on eccentric orbits are not the ideal
moon-search targets. 2. If hot Jupiters formed through PPS, their original
moons have little chance to survive. 3. Planets in multiple systems with small
eccentricities are more likely holding their primordial moons. 4. Compared to

gamma rays by examining the frequency-domain features of the photomultiplier
tube anode signal. This approach is insensitive to noise but is inevitably
affected by the baseline drift, similar to other pulse shape discrimination
methods. The baseline drift effect is attributed to the factors such as power
line fluctuation, dark current, noise disturbances, hum, and pulse tail in
front-end electronics. This effect needs to be elucidated and quantified before
the baseline shift can be estimated and removed from the captured signal.
Therefore, the effect of baseline shift on the discrimination performance of
neutrons and gamma rays with organic scintillation detectors using FGA is
investigated in this paper. The relationship between the baseline shift and
discrimination parameters of FGA is derived and verified by an experimental
system consisting of an americium-beryllium source, a BC501A liquid
scintillator detector, and a 5 GSPS 8-bit oscilloscope. Both theoretical and
experimental results show that the estimation of the baseline shift is
necessary, and the removal of baseline drift from the pulse shapes can improve
the discrimination performance of FGA.

biological cells are routinely confronted with multiple sources of
stochasticity, whose identification renders the detailed data analysis of
single molecule trajectories quite intricate. Here we consider subdiffusive
continuous time random walks, that represent a seminal model for the anomalous
diffusion of tracer particles in complex environments. This motion is
characterized by multiple trapping events with infinite mean sojourn time. In
real physical situations, however, instead of the full immobilization predicted
by the continuous time random walk model, the motion of the tracer particle
shows additional jiggling, for instance, due to thermal agitation of the
environment. We here present and analyze in detail an extension of the
continuous time random walk model. Superimposing the multiple trapping behavior
with additive Gaussian noise of variable strength, we demonstrate that the
resulting process exhibits a rich variety of apparent dynamic regimes. In
particular, such noisy continuous time random walks may appear ergodic while
the naked continuous time random walk exhibits weak ergodicity breaking.
Detailed knowledge of this behavior will be useful for the truthful physical
analysis of experimentally observed subdiffusion.

(1) a compact emission at the center tracing the dense inner part of the H II
region previously detected in 23 GHz continuum and it may trace a fast ionized
wind at the base, and (2) an extended thermal dust emission surrounding the H
II region, tracing the dense core previously detected in HC3N at the center of
the circumstellar envelope. The dense core is dusty and may contain mm-sized
dust grains. It may have a density enhancement in the equatorial plane. It is
also detected in carbon chain molecules HC3N and HCN, and their isotopologues,
with higher excitation lines tracing closer to the central star. It is also
detected in C2H3CN toward the innermost part. Most of the emission detected
here arises within ~ 630 AU (~0.7"") from the central star. A simple radiative
transfer model is used to derive the kinematics, physical conditions, and the
chemical abundances in the dense core. The dense core is expanding and
accelerating, with the velocity increasing roughly linearly from ~ 3 km/s in
the innermost part to ~ 16 km/s at 630 AU. The mass-loss rate in the dense core
is extremely high with a value of ~ 1.15x10^{-3} solar mass per year. The dense
core has a mass of ~ 0.47 solar mass and a dynamical age of ~ 400 yrs. It could
result from a recent enhanced heavy mass-loss episode that ends the AGB phase.

momentum and falls back onto the neutron star which gets transformed to a
stellar mass black hole. In order to study the hydrodynamics and
nucleosynthesis of such an accretion disk formed from the fallback material of
the supernova ejecta, we use the well established hydrodynamic models. In such
a disk neutrino cooling becomes important in the inner disk where the
temperature and density are higher. Higher the accretion rate (dot{M}), higher
is the density and temperature in the disks. In this work we deal with
accretion disks with relatively low accretion rates: 0.001 M_sun s^{-1}

predominantly advection dominated. We use He-rich and Si-rich abundances as the

the disk hydrodynamics and the nuclear network code, we study the abundance
evolution as matter inflows and falls into the central object. We investigate

magnetic-field strength in the solar corona. The burst was characterized by a
well pronounced band-splitting, which we used to estimate the density jump at
the shock and Alfven Mach number using the Rankine-Hugoniot relations. The
plasma frequency of the Type-II bursts is converted into height [R] in solar
radii using the appropriate density model, then we estimated the shock speed
[Vs], coronal Alfven velocity [Va], and the magnetic-field strength at
different heights. The relative bandwidth of the band-split is found to be in
the range 0.2 -- 0.25, corresponding to the density jump of X = 1.44 -- 1.56,
and the Alfven Mach number of MA = 1.35 -- 1.45. The inferred mean shock speed
was on the order of V ~ 667 km/s. From the dependencies V(R) and MA(R) we found
that Alfven speed slightly decreases at R ~ 1.3 -- 1.5. The magnetic-field
strength decreases from a value between 2.7 and 1.7 G at R ~ 1.3 -- 1.5 Rs
depending on the coronal-density model employed. We find that our results are
in good agreement with the empirical scaling by Dulk and McLean (Solar Phys.
57, 279, 1978) and Gopalswamy et al. (Astrophys. J. 744, 72, 2012). Our result
shows that Type-II band splitting method is an important tool for inferring the
coronal magnetic field, especially when independent measurements were made from
white light observations.

the variational optimization of a wave-function ansatz. Linearization of the
time-dependent variational principle near a variational minimum allows to
derive the random phase approximation (RPA). We show that the non-redundant

starting from a specific MPS reference. Excitation operators are identified,
which extends the analogy between HF and DMRG to the Tamm-Dancoff approximation

theory. For a small one-dimensional Hubbard chain, we use a CI-MPS ansatz with
single and double excitations to improve on the ground state and to calculate
low-lying excitation energies. For a symmetry-broken ground state of this

discuss calculations of the RPA-MPS correlation energy. With the long-range

[Pb/hs] between CEMP-s and CEMP-r/s stars indicate that the s-process material
of both CEMP-s and CEMP-r/s stars should have a uniform origin, i.e. mass
transfer from their predominant AGB companions. For the CEMP-r/s stars, we
found that the r-process should provide similar proportional contributes to the
second s-peak and the third s-peak elements, and also be responsible for the
higher overabundance of heavy elements than those in CEMP-s stars. Which hints
that the r-process origin of CEMP-r/s stars should be closely linked to the
main r-process. The fact that some small $r$ values exist for both barium and
CEMP-s stars, implies that the single exposure event of the s-process
nucleosynthesis should be general in a wide metallicity range of our Galaxy.
Based on the relation between $C_{r}$ and $C_{s}$, we suggest that the origin
of r-elements for CEMP-r/s stars have more sources. A common scenario is that
the formation of the binary system was triggered by only one or a few
supernova. In addition, accretion-induced collapse(AIC) or SN 1.5 should be the
supplementary scenario, especially for these whose pre-AGB companion with
higher mass and smaller orbit radius, which support the higher values of both

employed a classical interatomic potential rather than our quantum mechanical

and colloidal particles is simulated for the Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR)
model of elastic contacts, and a phase diagram in terms of particle elasticity
and surface energy is presented. When fibers self-assemble they form a network
for sufficiently large fiber-solvent surface energy. If the surface energy is
above the value where single particles crystallize the adhesion forces drive
diffusion-limited aggregation. Two mechanisms contribute to coarsening:
non-associated chains joining existing bundles, and fiber bundles merging.
Coarsening stops when the length of the network connections is roughly the
persistence length, independent of surface energy.
  If the surface energy is below the value where single particles crystallize,
a network can still be formed but at a much slower (reaction limited) rate.
Loose (liquid-like) assemblies between chains form when they happen to run
more-or-less parallel. These assemblies grow by diffusion and aggregation and
form a loose network, which sets in micro-phase separation, i.e. syneresis.
Only when the clusters crystallize, the coarsening process stops. In this case
the length of the network connections is larger than the persistence length of
a single chain, and depends on the value of the surface energy. All networks of
semiflexible homopolymers in this study show syneresis. Mixtures of fibers and
colloid particles also form fiber bundle networks, but by choosing the colloid
volume fraction sufficiently low, swelling gels are obtained. Applications of
this model are in biological systems where fibers self-assemble into cell walls

assume that the concentration of information molecules throughout the receiver

the accuracy of the lower bound is qualitatively impacted by those parameters.

Anti-proton and Ion Research (FAIR) will provide new possibilities for
charm-quark ($D$-meson) observables in heavy-ion collisions at low collision
energies and high baryon densities. To predict the collective flow and nuclear
modification factors of charm quarks in this environment, we apply a Langevin
approach for the transport of charm quarks in the UrQMD (hydrodynamics +
Boltzmann) hybrid model. Due to the inclusion of event-by-event fluctuations
and a full (3+1) dimensional hydrodynamical evolution, the UrQMD hybrid
approach provides a realistic evolution of the matter produced in heavy-ion
collisions.
  As drag and diffusion coefficients we use a resonance approach for elastic
heavy-quark scattering and assume a decoupling temperature of the charm quarks
from the hot medium of $130\, \MeV$. Hadronization of the charm quarks to
$D$-mesons by coalescence is included. Since the initial charm-quark
distribution at FAIR is unknown, we utilize two different initial charm-quark
distributions in our approach to estimate the uncertainty of these predictions.
We present calculations of the nuclear modification factor, $R_{AA}$, as well
as for the elliptic flow, $v_2$, in Pb+Pb collisions at
$E_{lab}=25\,\text{AGeV}$. The different medium modifications of $D$-mesons and
$\bar{D}$-mesons at high baryon-chemical potential are explored by modified
drag- and diffusion-coefficients using the corresponding fugacity factor. Here
we find a considerably larger medium modification for $\bar{\mathrm{D}}$- than
for $D$-mesons.

stiffness into the model. The model is validated by simulating single chains in
a heat bath, and comparing the endpoint distribution of the chains with

to a slightly shorter effective persistence length for a given bending
stiffness. To further validate the simulation model, polymer diffusion is
studied for fixed persistence length and varying polymer length N. The
diffusion constant shows crossover from Rouse to reptation behaviour. The
terminal relaxation time obtained from the monomer displacement is consistent

periodicity, but it is driven by a time-dependent field coupling highly

in quasienergy arises as a consequence of the n-fold discrete periodicity in
phase space induced by this driving field. We propose an explicit model to
realize such a phase space crystal and analyze its band structure in the frame
of a tight-binding approximation. The phase space crystal opens new ways to
engineer energy band structures, with the added advantage that its properties
can be changed in situ by tuning the driving field's parameters.

Factory, was interesting because of its relatively high luminosity and the high
velocity of the absorption lines, which was comparable to that of GRB/SNe,
suggesting a high explosion kinetic energy. However, no GRB was detected in
association with the SN. Here, the properties of SN2010ah are determined with
higher accuracy than previous studies through modelling. New Subaru telescope
photometry is presented. A bolometric light curve is constructed taking
advantage of the spectral similarity with SN1998bw. Radiation transport tools
are used to reproduce the spectra and the light curve. The results thus
obtained regarding ejecta mass, composition and kinetic energy are then used to
compute a synthetic light curve. This is in reasonable agreement with the early
bolometric light curve of SN2010ah, but a high abundance of 56Ni at high
velocity is required to reproduce the early rise, while a dense inner core must
be used to reproduce the slow decline at late phases. The high-velocity 56Ni
cannot have been located on our line of sight, which may be indirect evidence
for an off-axis, aspherical explosion. The main properties of SN2010ah are:
ejected mass ~ 3 Mo; kinetic energy ~10^52 erg, M(56Ni) ~ 0.25 Mo. The mass
located at v >~ 0.1c is ~0.2 Mo. Although these values, in particular the
kinetic energy, are quite large for a SN Ic, they are all smaller (especially
the ejecta mass) than those typical of GRB/SNe. This confirms the tendency for
these quantities to correlate, and suggests that there are minimum requirements
for a GRB/SN, which SN2010ah may not meet although it comes quite close.
Depending on whether a neutron star or a black hole was formed following core
collapse, SN2010ah was the explosion of a CO core of ~ 5-6 Mo, pointing to a
progenitor mass of ~24 - 28 Mo.

constraints mean that few studies have been successful at z>0.1, or for the

spectra of z>0.5 objects.
  Previously we described a technique for stacking cross correlations to obtain
reverberation mapping results at high z. Here we present the first results from
a campaign designed for this purpose. We construct stacked cross-correlation
functions for the CIV and MgII lines and find a clear peak in both. We find the
peak in the MgII correlation is at longer lags than CIV consistent with
previous results at low redshift. For the CIV sample we are able to bin by
luminosity and find evidence for increasing lags for more-luminous objects.
This CIV radius-luminosity relation is consistent with previous studies but
with a fraction of the observational cost.

cause repulsive pair scattering. The latter effect is however weakened by the
hybridization splitting of the electron pockets. The resulting

linearly with the fluorine surface coverage and for coverages exceeding 25% the
tubular structures are predicted to be more stable than their wire-like
counterparts. The bandgaps of the fully fluorinated systems are lower than
those of their fully hydrogenated counterparts by up to 0.79 eV for systems
having a relatively low silicon molar fraction. As the silicon molar fraction
increases these differences appear to reduce. For mixed fluorination and
hydrogenation surface decoration schemes the bandgaps usually lie between the
values of the fully hydrogenated and fully fluorinated systems. Furthermore,
the bandgap values of the silicon nanotubes are found to be more sensitive to
the fluorine surface coverage than those of the silicon nanowires. These
results indicate that surface functionalization may be used to control the
stability of narrow quasi-one-dimensional silicon nanostructures and opens the

masses for which the scattering cross section on nucleons can be probed using

potential are oscillating functions of magnetic field induction are considered.
The longitudinal Seebeck coefficient has been calculated for two models of
relaxation time:i)constant relaxation time and ii)relaxation time proportional
to the longitudinal velocity. It has been shown that in a quasi-classical
region of magnetic fields for the case of relaxation time proportional to the
longitudinal velocity Seebeck coefficient is less than for the case of constant
relaxation time. In this region for selected problem parameters it does not
exceed 4.37mu\V/K.In the strong quantizing magnetic fields for both models of
the relaxation time the longitudinal Seebeck coefficient is virtually the same.
For selected problem parameters its maximal modulus is 2033\muV/K. At the same
time, in the disordered layered crystals,in a quasi-classical region,the
Seebeck coefficient is approximately one order of magnitude less than for the
charge ordered crystals. In the strong magnetic fields,the Seebeck coefficient
for the disordered layered crystals is factor of 7 or 9 less than for the
charge ordered crystals. However,in super strong magnetic fields,under current
carriers concentration in the only filled Landau sub-band,for both models of of

first kind of Dickson polynomials of order $n$ and $u \in \mathbb{F}_q^*$. The
key observation in the proof is that $\mathcal{D}_5(x^2,u)$ is a planar

a few families of new skew Hadamard difference sets have been discovered. In

movements of private vehicles in the Florence district, in order to point out
new features of human mobility related to the use of time and space and to
define the dynamical properties of a stochastic model that could generate
similar patterns. Moreover, we can relate the predictability properties of
human mobility to the distribution of time passed between two successive trips.
Our analysis suggests the existence of a hierarchical structure in the mobility
patterns which divides the performed activities into three different
categories, according to the time cost, with different information contents. We
show that a Markov process defined by using the individual mobility network is
not able to reproduce this hierarchy, which seems the consequence of different
strategies in the activity choice. Our results could contribute to the

partitioning the workflow specification into smaller fragments that may be sent

on proxies that exploit connectivity to services in the workflow. These proxies
perform service invocations and compositions on behalf of the orchestration
services, and carry out data collection, retrieval, and mediation tasks. The
evaluation of our architecture implementation concludes that our decentralised
approach reduces the execution time of workflows, and scales accordingly with
the increasing size of data sets.

periodic driving signals which together are asymmetric under time reversal. In
this paper we investigate the phenomena of ANM for a deterministic particle
evolving in a periodic and symmetric potential subjected to an external
unbiased periodic driving and nonuniform space- dependent damping. It will be
shown that this system exhibits a complicated response behaviour as certain
control parameters are varied, most notably being, enhanced parameter regimes
exhibiting ANM as the static bias force is increased. Moreover, the solutions

transition to a buckled state. We account for the layer buckling by replacing
the microscopic energy with a coarse grained effective free energy that
accounts for the fine scale deformation of the layers. We augment this model
with a term to describe the energy of deforming buckled layers, which is
necessary to reproduce the experimentally observed Poisson's ratios
post-buckling. We examine the spatial distribution of the microstructure phases
for various stretching angles relative to the layer normal, and for different
length-to-width aspect ratios. When stretching parallel to the layer normal the
majority of the sample forms a bi-directionally buckled microstructure, except
at the clamps where uni-directional microstructure is predicted. When
stretching at small inclinations to the layer normal the phase of the sample is
sensitive to the aspect ratio of the sample, with the bi-directionally buckled
phase persistent to large angles only for small aspect ratios. We relate these
theoretical results to experiments on smectic-A elastomers.

increase of calcium selectivity: L0 (sodium selective, non-blocking channel) ->
M0 (non-selective channel) -> L1 (sodium selective channel with divalent block)
-> M1 (calcium selective channel exhibiting the anomalous mole fraction

identified with the eukaryotic (DEKA) sodium channel, and L1/L2 (speculatively)
with the bacterial NaChBac channel. The scheme created is able to account for
the experimentally observed mutation-induced transformations between
non-selective channels, sodium-selective channels, and calcium-selective
channels, which we interpret as transitions between different rows of the

permeation, we show explicitly that the multi-ion conduction bands of calcium

Type IIb supernova (SN) 2011dh for the first 100 days. We complement our
extensive dataset with SWIFT ultra-violet (UV) and Spitzer mid-infrared (MIR)
data to build a UV to MIR bolometric lightcurve using both photometric and
spectroscopic data. Hydrodynamical modelling of the SN based on this bolometric
lightcurve have been presented in Bersten (2012). We find that the absorption
minimum for the hydrogen lines is never seen below ~11000 km/s but approaches
this value as the lines get weaker. This suggests that the interface between
the helium core and hydrogen rich envelope is located near this velocity in
agreement with the Bersten et al. (2012) He4R270 ejecta model. Spectral
modelling of the hydrogen lines using this ejecta model supports the conclusion
and we find a hydrogen mass of 0.01-0.04 solar masses to be consistent with the
observed spectral evolution. We estimate that the photosphere reaches the
helium core at 5-7 days whereas the helium lines appear between ~10 and ~15
days, close to the photosphere and then move outward in velocity until ~40
days. This suggests that increasing non-thermal excitation due to decreasing
optical depth for the gamma-rays is driving the early evolution of these lines.
We also provide and discuss pre- and post-explosion observations of the SN site
which shows a reduction by 75 percent in flux at the position of the yellow
supergiant coincident with SN 2011dh. The B, V and r band decline rates of
0.0073, 0.0090 and 0.0053 mag/day respectively are consistent with the
remaining flux being emitted by the SN. Hence we find that the star was indeed
the progenitor of SN 2011dh as previously suggested by Maund et al. (2011) and
which is also consistent with the results from the hydrodynamical modelling.

unilaterally structured, the direction of knowledge transfer should be taken
into account as illustrated in the analysis of clubs and entropy, 2) The
stability of most Knowledge Networks is questionable, 3) Few networks are
effective in sharing information, while most Knowledge Networks cannot benefit
from the network effect, have rather limited capability for coordination,
information propagation and synchronization and are not able to integrate Tacit
knowledge, 4) Few networks have large cliques which have to be managed with
caution as their role may be highly constructive or destructive, 5) While
agents with rich connections form clubs, as in most social networks, the poor
club effect is not negligible when we take into account the link direction, 6)
The directed link analysis of entropy reveals the low
complexity-diversification of the Knowledge Networks. In fact the only high
entropy network found, has been improved by Knowledge Management Professionals.
As most Knowledge Networks underperform, there is plenty of room for further
customized analysis in order to improve communication efficiency, coordination,
Tacit knowledge dissemination and robustness. This is the first comparative
study of real Knowledge Networks in terms of graph theoretic methods.

the analysis of high-throughput sequencing experiments. Infrequent k-mers are
assumed to be a result of sequencing errors. The frequent k-mers constitute a
reduced but error-free representation of the experiment, which can inform read
error correction or serve as the input to de novo assembly methods. Ideally,
the memory requirement for counting should be linear in the number of frequent
k-mers and not in the, typically much larger, total number of k-mers in the
read library.
  We present a novel method that balances time, space and accuracy requirements
to efficiently extract frequent k-mers even for high coverage libraries and
large genomes such as human. Our method is designed to minimize cache-misses in
a cache-efficient manner by using a Pattern-blocked Bloom filter to remove
infrequent k-mers from consideration in combination with a novel
sort-and-compact scheme, instead of a Hash, for the actual counting. While this
increases theoretical complexity, the savings in cache misses reduce the
empirical running times. A variant can resort to a counting Bloom filter for
even larger savings in memory at the expense of false negatives in addition to
the false positives common to all Bloom filter based approaches. A comparison
to the state-of-the-art shows reduced memory requirements and running times.
Note that we also provide the first competitive method to count k-mers up to
size 64.

January 2012, the source suddenly showed a powerful X-ray emission with a
luminosity of 1e38 erg/s (assuming a distance of 780 kpc). In the following
weeks, its luminosity overcame 1e39 erg/s, remaining fairly constant for at
least 40 days and fading below 1e38 erg/s in the next 200 days. The spectrum
can be well described by a single multi-color disk blackbody model which
progressively softened during the decay (from kT=0.9 keV to 0.4 keV). No
emission from ULX2 was detected down to 22 mag in the optical band and to 23-24
mag in the near ultraviolet. We compare its properties with those of other
known ULXs and Galactic black hole transients, finding more similarities with
the latter.

for storing single photons in a rare-earth-ion doped crystal. The basic idea is
to benefit from a coherent free-induced decay type re-emission which occurs
naturally when a photon with a broadband spectrum is absorbed by a narrow
atomic transition in an optically dense ensemble. This allows for a
high-bandwidth memory for realistic material parameters. Long storage time and
on-demand readout are obtained by means of spins states in a lambda-type
configuration, through the transfer of the optical coherence to a spin
coherence (so-called spin-wave storage). We give explicit formulas and show
numerical results which make it possible to gain insight into the dependence of
the memory efficiency on the optical depth and on the width and the shape of
stored photons. We present a feasibility study in rare-earth doped crystals and
show that high efficiencies and high bandwidth can be obtained with realistic
parameters. High-bandwidth memories using spin-wave storage offers the
possibility of very high time-bandwidth products, which is important for
experiment where high repetition rates are needed.

information molecules and then degrade them so that they cannot interfere with
future transmissions. A lower bound expression on the expected number of
molecules measured at the receiver is derived. A simple binary receiver
detection scheme is proposed where the number of observed molecules is sampled
at the time when the maximum number of molecules is expected. Insight is also
provided into the selection of an appropriate bit interval. The expected bit
error probability is derived as a function of the current and all previously
transmitted bits. Simulation results show the accuracy of the bit error
probability expression and the improvement in communication performance by
having active enzymes present.

  (http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/CLAS/Departments/math/Pages/MathStats.aspx)",,,,"physics.chem-ph physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Transport phenomena in porous media are commonplace in our daily lives.
Examples and applications include heat and moisture transport in soils, baking
and drying of food stuffs, curing of cement, and evaporation of fuels in wild
fires. Of particular interest to this study are heat and moisture transport in
unsaturated soils. Historically, mathematical models for these processes are
derived by coupling classical Darcy's, Fourier's, and Fick's laws with volume
averaged conservation of mass and energy and empirically based source and sink
terms. Recent experimental and mathematical research has proposed modifications
and suggested limitations in these classical equations. The primary goal of
this thesis is to derive a thermodynamically consistent system of equations for
heat and moisture transport in terms of the chemical potential that addresses
some of these limitations. The physical processes of interest are primarily
diffusive in nature and, for that reason, we focus on using the macroscale
chemical potential to build and simplify the models. The resulting coupled
system of nonlinear partial differential equations is solved numerically and
validated against the classical equations and against experimental data. It
will be shown that under a mixture theoretic framework, the classical Richards'
equation for saturation is supplemented with gradients in temperature, relative
humidity, and the time rate of change of saturation. Furthermore, it will be
shown that restating the water vapor diffusion equation in terms of chemical
potential eliminates the necessity for an empirically based fitting parameter.

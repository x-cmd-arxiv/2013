connection with a second-order rotational phase transition. However, the
mechanism responsible for these well-ordered metastable vortex lattice phases
is not well understood. Using small-angle neutron scattering, we studied the
vortex lattice in MgB2 as it was driven from a metastable to the ground state
through a series of small changes in the applied magnetic field. Our results
show that metastable vortex lattice domains persist in the presence of
substantial vortex motion and directly demonstrate that the metastability is
not due to vortex pinning. Instead, we propose that it is due to the jamming of
counterrotated vortex lattice domains which prevents a rotation to the ground
state orientation.

are derived from a distribution that does not take the additional maximum
constraint into account. In this article, I quantify the variations of the most
probable and the expected values of the ellipticity and the prolaticity when
considering this additional constraint as well as the implications for the
ellipsoidal-collapse model. Based on the statistics of Gaussian random fields,
it is possible to set up a joint distribution for the eigenvalues of the
gravitational-shear tensor and the matter density that incorporates the maximum
constraint by invoking a vanishing first derivative and a negative definite
second derivative of the density field into the calculation. In the density
range relevant for cosmological structure formation, both the most probable and
the expected value of the ellipticity calculated from the standard distribution
used in the literature are about 3-8 per cent higher compared to the ones
calculated under the additional assumption of a density maximum. Additionally,
the analogous quantities for the prolaticity do not vanish but acquire slightly
positive values in the range of $10^{-3}$-$10^{-2}$. For large overdensities,
the predictions from both distributions converge. The values for
$\delta_\mathrm{c}$ and $\Delta_\mathrm{v}$ derived from the
ellipsoidal-collapse model using the standard distribution for the initial
ellipticity and prolaticity are up to 4 and 6 per cent higher, respectively,

conformal symmetry superalgebras which describe classical symmetries of these

process, we elucidate the general framework of cohomological algebra which
underpins the construction. We then consider the corresponding perturbative
quantum field theories. In particular, we examine the conditions necessary for
conformal supersymmetries to be preserved at the quantum level, i.e. when the

superconformal invariance of amplitudes. To this end, we prescribe a
renormalization scheme for time-ordered products that enter the perturbative

criteria which ensure that all conformal supersymmetries are preserved at the

quite effective for finding the shortest path on large but sparse road
networks, social graphs have quite different characteristics: they are
generally non-spatial, non-weighted, scale-free, and they exhibit small-world
properties in addition to their massive size. In particular, the existence of
hubs, those vertices with a large number of connections, explodes the search
space, making the shortest path computation surprisingly challenging. In this
paper, we introduce a set of novel techniques centered around hubs,
collectively referred to as the Hub-Accelerator framework, to compute the
k-degree shortest path (finding the shortest path between two vertices if their
distance is within k). These techniques enable us to significantly reduce the
search space by either greatly limiting the expansion scope of hubs (using the
novel distance- preserving Hub-Network concept) or completely pruning away the
hubs in the online search (using the Hub2-Labeling approach). The
Hub-Accelerator approaches are more than two orders of magnitude faster than
BFS and the state-of-the-art approximate shortest path method Sketch for the
shortest path computation. The Hub- Network approach does not introduce
additional index cost with light pre-computation cost; the index size and index
construction cost of Hub2-Labeling are also moderate and better than or
comparable to the approximation indexing Sketch method.

was shown by Stearns (1967), and later improved by Valiant (1975) regarding the
complexity. The decidability question for nondeterministic PDA, answered

model of quantum field theory, there is a natural definition of form factors in
any mixed state. These generalize the usual form factors, and are building
blocks for mixed-state correlation functions. We study the cases of mixed
states that are diagonal in the asymptotic particle basis, and obtain exact
expressions for all mixed-state form factors of order and disorder fields. We
use novel techniques based on deriving and solving a system of nonlinear
functional differential equations. We then write down the full form factor
expansion for mixed-state correlation functions of these fields. Under weak
analytic conditions on the eigenvalues of the density matrix, this is an exact
large-distance expansion. The form factors agree with the known
finite-temperature form factors when the mixed state is specialized to a
thermal Gibbs ensemble. Our results can be used to analyze correlation
functions in generalized Gibbs ensembles (which occur after quantum quenches).
Applying this to the density matrix for non-equilibrium steady states with
energy flows, we observe that non-equilibrium form factors have branch cuts in
rapidity space. We verify that this is in agreement with a non-equilibrium
generalization of the KMS relations, and we conjecture that the leading
large-distance behavior of order and disorder non-equilibrium correlation
functions contains oscillations in the log of the distance between the fields.

cannot just consider it as a collection of mutated cells but more as a complex
system of many interacting cellular and microenvironmental elements. At its
simplest, a growing tumor with increased proliferation capacity must compete
for space as a limited resource. Hypercellularity leads to a contact-inhibited
core with a competitive proliferating rim. Evolution and selection occurs, and
an individual cell's capacity to survive and propagate is determined by its
combination of traits and interaction with the environment. With heterogeneity
in phenotypes, the clone that will dominate is not always obvious as there are
both local interactions and global pressures. Several combinations of
phenotypes can coexist, changing the fitness of the whole.
  To understand some aspects of heterogeneity in a growing tumor we build an
off-lattice agent based model consisting of individual cells with assigned
trait values for proliferation and migration rates. We represent heterogeneity
in these traits with frequency distributions and combinations of traits with
density maps. How the distributions change over time is dependent on how traits
are passed on to progeny cells, which is our main inquiry. We bypass the
translation of genetics to behavior by focussing on the functional end result
of inheritance of the phenotype combined with the environmental influence of

field and hemispherical asymmetry as a function of the number of e-foldings of
tachyonic growth \Delta N and the tachyonic mass term cH^2. We find that a
large hemispherical asymmetry due to the modulation of |\Phi| can easily be
generated via the spatial modulation of |\Phi| across the horizon, with Delta
|\Phi|/|\Phi| > 0.5 when the observed Universe exits the horizon within 10-40
e-foldings of the beginning of tachyonic evolution and c is in the range 0.1-1.
The spectral index of the isocurvature and curvaton perturbations is generally
negative, corresponding to a red power spectrum. Dark matter isocurvature
perturbations due to an axion-like curvaton with a large hemispherical
asymmetry may be able to explain the hemispherical asymmetry observed by WMAP
and Planck. In this case, the red spectrum can additionally suppress the
hemispherical asymmetry at small scales, which should make it easier to satisfy
scale-dependence requirements on the asymmetry from quasar number counts.

the coefficients are instead log-Lipschitz or log-Zygmund, we prove
observability estimates ""with loss of derivatives"": in order to estimate the
total energy of the solutions, we need measurements on some higher order
Sobolev norms at the boundary. This last result represents the intermediate
step between the Lipschitz (or Zygmund) case, when observability estimates hold
in the energy space, and the H\""older one, when they fail at any finite order
(as proved in \cite{Castro-Z}) due to an infinite loss of derivatives. We also
establish a sharp relation between the modulus of continuity of the
coefficients and the loss of derivatives in the observability estimates. In
particular, we will show that under any condition which is weaker than the
log-Lipschitz one (not only H\""older, for instance), observability estimates
fail in general, while in the intermediate instance between the Lipschitz and
the log-Lipschitz ones they can hold only admitting a loss of a finite number

theory is presented for line solitons, whose envelope varies only along one

two-dimensional problem, it is no longer viable to rely on a certain recurrence
relation for going beyond all orders of the usual multi-scale perturbation
expansion, a key step of the exponential asymptotics procedure previously used
for solitons in one-dimensional problems. Instead, we propose a more direct
treatment which not only overcomes the recurrence-relation limitation, but also
simplifies the exponential asymptotics process. Using this modified technique,
we show that line solitons with any rational line slopes bifurcate out from
every Bloch-band edge; and for each rational slope, two line-soliton families
exist. Furthermore, line solitons can bifurcate from interior points of Bloch
bands as well, but such line solitons exist only for a couple of special line
angles due to resonance with the Bloch bands. In addition, we show that a
countable set of multi-line-soliton bound states can be constructed
analytically. The analytical predictions are compared with numerical results
for both symmetric and asymmetric potentials, and good agreement is obtained.

bidders' private values are sampled. Rather than solving the problem in
particular special cases, our work aims to provide universal lower bounds on
the revenue-to-welfare ratio that hold under the most general hypotheses that
allow for non-trivial such bounds.
  Our results can be summarized as follows. For general feasibility
constraints, the revenue-to-welfare ratio is at least a constant times the
inverse-square-root of the number of agents, and this is tight up to constant
factors. For downward-closed feasibility constraints, the revenue-to-welfare
ratio is bounded below by a constant. Both results require the bidders'

decades. Yet with the development of information technology and social media,
the risk in revealing private data to service providers has been a growing
concern to more and more users. Trade-offs between quality and privacy in
recommendation systems naturally arise. In this paper, we present a privacy
preserving recommendation framework based on groups. The main idea is to use
groups as a natural middleware to preserve users' privacy. A distributed
preference exchange algorithm is proposed to ensure the anonymity of data,
wherein the effective size of the anonymity set asymptotically approaches the
group size with time. We construct a hybrid collaborative filtering model based
on Markov random walks to provide recommendations and predictions to group
members. Experimental results on the MovieLens and Epinions datasets show that
our proposed methods outperform the baseline methods, L+ and ItemRank, two
state-of-the-art personalized recommendation algorithms, for both
recommendation precision and hit rate despite the absence of personal

addressed. A mismatched cognitive multiple-access channel is introduced, and an
inner bound on its capacity region is derived using two alternative encoding
methods: superposition coding and random binning. The inner bounds are derived
by analyzing the average error probability of the code ensemble for both
methods and by a tight characterization of the resulting error exponents.
Random coding converse theorems are also derived. A comparison of the
achievable regions shows that in the matched case, random binning performs as
well as superposition coding, i.e., the region achievable by random binning is
equal to the capacity region. The achievability results are further specialized
to obtain a lower bound on the mismatch capacity of the single-user channel by
investigating a cognitive multiple access channel whose achievable sum-rate
serves as a lower bound on the single-user channel's capacity. In certain
cases, for given auxiliary random variables this bound strictly improves on the

For clusters younger than 10 Myr, M_3rd is proportional to Sigma_HI^0.6, M_3rd

proportional to Sigma_SFR^0.9. For the older sample in M51, the lack of tight
correlations is probably due to the combination of the strong azimuthal
variations in the surface densities of gas and star formation rate, and the
cluster ages. These two facts mean that neither the azimuthal average of the
surface densities at a given radius, nor the surface densities at the
present-day location of a stellar cluster represent the true surface densities
at the place and time of cluster formation. In the case of the younger sample,
even if the clusters have not yet traveled too far from their birthsites, the

with non-minimal kinetic terms. As an example, we examine the existence and
stability of preheating in the presence of a Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) inflaton
coupled to a canonical matter field. The simulations represent the full
non-linear theory in the presence of an expanding Universe. We show that
parametric resonance in the matter field, along with self-resonance in the
inflaton, repopulate the Universe with matter particles as efficiently as in
traditional preheating.

(EW) on the spatial distribution of z~3 Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) and report
significant differences in their auto-correlation functions (ACFs). The results
are obtained using samples of ~10,000-57,000 LBGs from the Canada-France-Hawaii
Telescope Legacy Survey. We find that magnitude has a larger effect on the ACF
amplitude on small scales (<~1 Mpc) and that colour is more influential on
large scales (>~1 Mpc). We find the most significant differences between ACFs
for LBGs with dominant net Ly-alpha EW in absorption (aLBGs) and dominant net
Ly-alpha EW in emission (eLBGs) determined from >~95% pure samples of each
population using a photometric technique calibrated from ~1000 spectra. The
aLBG ACF one-halo term departs from a power law fit near ~1 Mpc, corresponding
to the virial radii of M_DM ~10^13 M_solar haloes, and shows a strong two-halo
term amplitude. In contrast, the eLBG ACF one-halo term departs at ~0.12 Mpc,
suggesting parent haloes of M_DM ~10^11 M_solar, and a two-halo term that
exhibits a `hump' on intermediate scales that we localize to the faintest,
bluest members. We find that the `hump' can be well fit with a model in which a
significant fraction of eLBGs reside on shells. The auto- and cross-correlation
functions indicate that aLBGs are found in massive, group-like haloes and that
eLBGs are found largely on group outskirts and in the field. Ly-alpha is a
tracer of several intrinsic LBG properties, including morphology, implying that
the mechanisms behind the morphology-density relation are in place at z~3 and
that Ly-alpha EW may be a key environment diagnostic. Finally, our results show
that the mass of LBGs has been underestimated because the LBG ACF amplitude is
lower than the true average as a result of the spatial anti-correlation of the
spectral sub-types (abridged).

characterise and quantify the alignment of dark matter haloes on the

correlations between some fundamental parameters that characterize the X-ray
emission, i.e. the X-ray spectral slope, and the X-ray ""loudness"", and the
accretion rate, both absolute and normalized to the Eddington luminosity
(Eddington ratio). We parametrize the X-ray loudness using three different
quantities: the bolometric correction, the two-point spectral index and the
disk/corona luminosity ratio. We find that the X-ray spectral index depends on
the normalized accretion rate while the ""X-ray loudness"" depends on both the
normalized and the absolute accretion rate. The dependence on the Eddington
ratio, in particular, is probably induced by the X-ray spectral slope-Eddington
ratio correlation. The two proxies usually adopted in the literature to
quantify the X-ray loudness of an AGN, i.e. the bolometric correction and the
two-point spectral index, behave differently, with the bolometric correction
being more sensitive to the Eddington ratio and the two-point spectral index
having a stronger dependence with the absolute accretion. The explanation of
this result is likely related to the different sensitivity of the two
parameters to the X-ray spectral index.

may be the nucleus of a satellite galaxy, undergoing minor merger with the S0

particle hydrodynamics simulations of the minor merger between a S0 galaxy and
a gas-rich bulgy satellite galaxy, and by comparing the results with the
available photometric Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data of ESO 243-49 and of
the HLX-1 counterpart. In particular, we derive synthetic surface brightness
profiles for the simulated counterpart of HLX-1 in six HST filters, ranging
from far ultraviolet (FUV) to infrared wavelengths. Such synthetic profiles
include a contribution from the stellar population associated with the
simulated disrupted satellite and a contribution from an irradiated disc model.
These are in reasonable agreement with the observed surface brightness profiles
of the HLX-1 counterpart, provided that the merger is at sufficiently late
stage (>~2.5 Gyr since the first pericentre passage). The main difference
between models and observations is in the FUV band, where the HST image shows a
fuzzy and extended emission. We show that the spectral energy distribution of
the bulge of ESO 243-49 cannot be explained with a single old stellar
population, but requires the existence of a younger stellar component. This is
in good agreement with the star formation history derived from our N-body
simulations, and is a further hint for the minor merger scenario.

limb-brightened emission from the entire periphery of the shell and faint
filamentary structures in the interior. As with other young remnants, this
emission is produced by dust grains, warmed to $\sim 100$ K in the post-shock
environment by collisions with energetic electrons and ions. The ratio of the
70 to 24 $\mu$m fluxes is a diagnostic of the dust temperature, which in turn
is a sensitive function of the plasma density. We find significant variations
in the 70/24 flux ratio around the periphery of Tycho's forward shock, implying
order-of-magnitude variations in density. While some of these are likely
localized interactions with dense clumps of the interstellar medium, we find an
overall gradient in the ambient density surrounding Tycho, with densities 3-10
times higher in the NE than in the SW. This large density gradient is
qualitatively consistent with the variations in the proper motion of the shock
observed in radio and X-ray studies. Overall, the mean ISM density around Tycho
is quite low ($\sim 0.1-0.2$ cm$^{-3}$), consistent with the lack of thermal
X-ray emission observed at the forward shock. We perform two-dimensional
hydrodynamic simulations of a Type Ia SN expanding into a density gradient in
the ISM, and find that the overall round shape of the remnant is still easily
acheivable, even for explosions into significant gradients. However, this leads
to an offset of the center of the explosion from the geometric center of the
remnant of up to 20%, although lower values of 10% are preferred. The best
match with hydrodynamical simulations is achieved if Tycho is located at a
large (3-4 kpc) distance in a medium with a mean preshock density of $\sim 0.2$
cm$^{-3}$. Such preshock densities are obtained for highly ($\ga 50$%) porous
ISM grains.

Riemannian geometry induced by the metric tensor, using the quantum XY chain in
a transverse field as our primary example. We focus on a particular geometric
invariant -- the Gaussian curvature -- and show how both integrals of the
curvature within a given phase and singularities of the curvature near phase
transitions are protected by critical scaling theory. For cases where the
curvature is integrable, we show that the integrated curvature provides a new
geometric invariant, which like the Chern number characterizes individual
phases of matter. For cases where the curvature is singular, we classify three
types -- integrable, conical, and curvature singularities -- and detail
situations where each type of singularity should arise. Finally, to connect
this abstract geometry to experiment, we discuss three different methods for
measuring the metric tensor, namely via integrating a properly weighted noise
spectral function and by using leading order responses of the work distribution
to ramps and quenches in quantum many-body systems.

area of research in particle physics, solid state physics, ultra-cold gases,

monopoles were found experimentally. Using the Aharonov-Bohm effect, one of the
central results of quantum physics, shows however, that an effective monopole
field can be produced. Understanding the effects of such a monopole field on
its surroundings is crucial to its observation and provides a better grasp of
fundamental physical theory. We realize the diffraction of fast electrons at a
magnetic monopole field generated by a nanoscopic magnetized ferromagnetic
needle. Previous studies have been limited to theoretical semiclassical optical
calculations of the motion of electrons in such a monopole field. Solid state
systems like the recently studied 'spin ice' provide a constrained system to
study similar fields, but make it impossible to separate the monopole from the
material. Free space diffraction helps to understand the dynamics of the
electron-monopole system without the complexity of a solid state system. The
use of a simple object such as a magnetized needle will allow various areas of
physics to use the general dynamical effects of monopole fields without
requiring a monopole particle or specific solids which have internal
monopole-like properties. The experiment performed here shows that even without
a true magnetic monopole particle, the theoretical background on monopoles
serves as a basis for experiments and can be applied to efficiently create
electron vortices. Various predictions about angular momentum and general field
effects can readily be studied using the available equipment. This realization
provides insights for the scientific community on how to detect magnetic

candidate host stars. Most of these stars are fainter than 14th magnitude, in
contrast to other spectroscopic follow-up studies. This sample includes many
high-priority Earth-sized candidate planets. A set of model spectra are fitted
to R~3000 optical spectra of 268 stars to improve estimates of Teff, log(g),
and [Fe/H] for the dwarfs in the range 4750K<Teff<7200K. These stellar
properties are used to find new stellar radii and, in turn, new radius
estimates for the candidate planets. The result of improved stellar
characteristics is a more accurate representation of this Kepler exoplanet
sample and identification of promising candidates for more detailed study. This
stellar sample, particularly among stars with Teff>5200K, includes a greater
number of relatively evolved stars with larger radii than assumed by the
mission on the basis of multi-color broadband photometry. About 26% of the
modelled stars require radii to be revised upwards by a factor of 1.35 or
greater, and modelling of 87% of the stars suggest some increase in radius. The
sample presented here also exhibits a change in the incidence of planets larger
than 3-4 Earth radii as a function of metallicity. Once [Fe/H] increases to
>=-0.05, large planets suddenly appear in the sample while smaller planets are
found orbiting stars with a wider range of metallicity. The modelled stellar
spectra, as well as an additional 84 stars of mostly lower effective
temperatures, are made available to the community.

algorithm by a factor of O(log(min{n, h})), where n is the number of agents and
h is the ratio between the highest and lowest nonzero valuations in the
support. We also provide a lower bound illustrating that this inflation of the
social cost is essential: no BIC cost-recovering mechanism can achieve an
approximation factor better than \Omega(log(n)) or \Omega(log(h)) in general.
  Our techniques extend to show that a certain class of truthful algorithms can
be made cost-recovering in the non-Bayesian setting, in such a way that the
approximation factor degrades by at most O(log(min{n, h})). This is an
improvement over previously-known constructions with inflation factor O(log n).

of primordial gravitational waves in the framework of Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz

the ones violating parity, generically appear. By calculating the three point
function, we find that the leading-order contributions to the non-gaussianities
come from the usual second-order derivative terms, which produce the same
bispectrum as that found in general relativity. The contributions from
high-order spatial n-th derivative terms are always suppressed by a factor
$(H/M_*)^{n-2} \; (n \ge 3)$, where $H$ denotes the inflationary energy and
$M_*$ the suppression mass scale of the high-order spatial derivative operators
of the theory. Therefore, the next leading-order contributions come from the
3-dimensional gravitational Chern-Simons term. With some reasonable arguments,
it is shown that this 3-dimensional operator is the only one that violates the
parity and in the meantime has non-vanishing contributions to
non-gaussianities.

quantify the morphology of the galaxies using the effective radius, reff, and
S\'ersic index, n. In both the cluster and field, approximately half of the
bulge-dominated galaxies (n > 2) reside on the red sequence of the
color-magnitude diagram, and most disk-dominated galaxies (n < 2) have colors
expected for star-forming galaxies. There is weak evidence that cluster
galaxies have redder rest-frame U - B colors and higher stellar masses compared
to the field. Star-forming galaxies in both the cluster and field show no
significant differences in their morphologies. In contrast, there is evidence
that quiescent galaxies in the cluster have larger median effective radii and
smaller S\'ersic indices compared to the field with a significance of 2?. These
differences are most pronounced for galaxies at clustercentric distances 1 Mpc
< Rproj < 1.5 Mpc, which have low S\'ersic indices and possibly larger
effective radii, more consistent with star-forming galaxies at this epoch and
in contrast to other quiescent galaxies. We argue that star-forming galaxies
are processed under the influence of the cluster environment at distances
greater than the cluster-halo virial radius. Our results are consistent with
models where gas accretion onto these galaxies is suppressed from processes
associated with the cluster environment.

luminosity of approximately 31 inverse nanobarns, were collected during the
2013 LHC pPb run at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV by the
CMS experiment. The results are compared to 2.76 TeV semi-peripheral PbPb
collision data, collected during the 2011 PbPb run, covering a similar range of
particle multiplicities. The observed correlations are characterized by the
near-side (abs(Delta(phi)~0) associated pair yields and the azimuthal
anisotropy Fourier harmonics (v[n]). The second-order (v[2]) and third-order
(v[3]) anisotropy harmonics are extracted using the two-particle azimuthal
correlation technique. A four-particle correlation method is also applied to
obtain the value of v[2] and further explore the multi-particle nature of the
correlations. Both associated pair yields and anisotropy harmonics are studied
as a function of particle multiplicity and transverse momentum. The associated
pair yields, the four-particle v[2], and the v[3] become apparent at about the
same multiplicity. A remarkable similarity in the v[3] signal as a function of
multiplicity is observed between the pPb and PbPb systems. Predictions based on
the color glass condensate and hydrodynamic models are compared to the

  Superposition Coding",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We analyze the problem of transmitting information to multiple users over a
shared wireless channel. The problem of resource allocation (RA) for the users
with the knowledge of their channel state information has been treated
extensively in the literature where various approaches trading off the users'
throughput and fairness were proposed. The emphasis was mostly on the
time-sharing (TS) approach, where the resource allocated to the user is
equivalent to its time share of the channel access. In this work, we propose to
take advantage of the broadcast nature of the channel and we adopt
superposition coding (SC)-known to outperform TS in multiple users broadcasting
scenarios. In SC, users' messages are simultaneously transmitted by superposing
their codewords with different power fractions under a total power constraint.
The main challenge is to find a simple way to allocate these power fractions to
all users taking into account the fairness/throughput tradeoff. We present an
algorithm with this purpose and we apply it in the case of popular proportional
fairness (PF). The obtained results using SC are illustrated with various
numerical examples where, comparing to TS, a rate increase between 20% and 300%
is observed.

a covariant gauge-fixing procedure that removes gauge invariance associated to

main feature of this calculation, which is performed in the Feynman 't Hooft

conflicting properties: entrainability to synchronize internal time with

period. These two aspects do not easily coexist because better entrainability
favors higher sensitivity, which may sacrifice the regularity. To investigate
conditions for satisfying the two properties, we analytically calculated the
optimal phase-response curve with a variational method. Our result indicates an
existence of a dead zone, i.e., a time period during which input stimuli
neither advance nor delay the clock. A dead zone appears only when input
stimuli obey the time course of actual solar radiation but a simple sine curve
cannot yield a dead zone. Our calculation demonstrates that every circadian

used in the dynamic-thermodynamic modeling of sea ice. The central issue
examined is how the evolution of the ice area is treated when modeling a
partial ice cover using a two-category-thickness scheme; thin sea ice and open
water in one category and ""thick"" sea ice in the second. The problem with the
scheme is that the area-evolution is handled in a manner that violates the
basic rules of calculus, which leads to a neglected area-evolution term that is
equivalent to neglecting a leading-order latent heat flux. We demonstrate the
consequences by constructing energy balance models with a fractional ice cover
and studying them under the influence of increased radiative forcing. It is
shown that the neglected flux is particularly important in a decaying ice cover
approaching the transitions to seasonal or ice-free conditions. Clearly, a
mishandling of the evolution of the ice area has leading-order effects on the
ice-albedo feedback. Accordingly, it may be of considerable importance to
re-examine the relevant climate model schemes and to begin the process of
converting them to fully resolve the sea ice thickness distribution in a manner
such as remapping, which does not in principle suffer from the pathology we
describe.

Our results show that, in general, the Mean First Passage Time (MFPT) is a

AGN hosts show an excess of IR emission at {\lambda}>3{\mu}m compared to
non-AGN galaxies which might indicate increased star formation rates. In
addition, the frequency of AGN in massive galaxies is about twice higher for
the ones with young stellar populations compared to the older ones.

boundary integral equations (TDBIEs). It shares some properties of convolution
quadrature (CQ), but instead of being based on an underlying ODE solver the
approximation is explicitly constructed in terms of compactly supported basis
functions. This results in sparse system matrices and makes it computationally
more efficient than using the linear multistep version of CQ for TDBIE
time-stepping. We use a Volterra integral equation (VIE) to illustrate the
derivation of this new approach: at time step $t_n = n h$ the VIE solution is
approximated in a backwards-in-time manner in terms of basis functions $\phi_j$
by $u(t_n-t) \approx \sum_{j=0}^n u_{n-j}\,\phi_j(t/h)$ for $t \in [0,t_n]$. We
show that using isogeometric B-splines of degree $m\ge 1$ on $[0,\infty)$ in
this framework gives a second order accurate scheme, but cubic splines with the
parabolic runout conditions at $t=0$ are fourth order accurate. We establish a
methodology for the stability analysis of VIEs and demonstrate that the new
methods are stable for non-smooth kernels which are related to convergence
analysis for TDBIEs, including the case of a Bessel function kernel oscillating
at frequency $O(1/h)$. Numerical results for VIEs and for TDBIE problems on
both open and closed surfaces confirm the theoretical predictions.

machine (RBM), is introduced. The algorithm is applied for the spectral
classification in astronomy. RBM is a bipartite generative graphical model with
two separate layers (one visible layer and one hidden layer), which can extract
higher level features to represent the original data. Despite generative, RBM
can be used for classification when modified with a free energy and a soft-max
function. Before spectral classification, the original data is binarized
according to some rule. Then we resort to the binary RBM to classify
cataclysmic variables (CVs) and non-CVs (one half of all the given data for
training and the other half for testing). The experiment result shows
state-of-the-art accuracy of 100%, which indicates the efficiency of the binary
RBM algorithm.

during the coupling to the soliton eigen state. Group-velocity-mathing between
the local and generated wave is necessary not only as it produces a

$r_{\rm mp}(\nu \tau)$ of events triggered over all generations within any
sufficiently large time window $\tau$ exhibits, at criticality, a super-linear
dependence $r_{\rm mp}(\nu \tau) \sim (\nu \tau)^\gamma$ (with $\gamma >1$) on
the total number $\nu \tau$ of the immigrants arriving at the Poisson rate
$\nu$. In branching processes in which immigrants (or sources) are
characterized by fertilities distributed according to an asymptotic power law
tail with tail exponent $1 < \gamma \leqslant 2$, the exponent of the
super-linear law for $r_{\rm mp}(\nu \tau)$ is identical to the exponent
$\gamma$ of the distribution of fertilities. For $\gamma>2$ and for standard
branching processes without power law distribution of fertilities, $r_{\rm
mp}(\nu \tau) \sim (\nu \tau)^2$. This novel scaling law replaces and tames the
divergence $\nu \tau/(1-n)$ of the mean total number ${\bar R}_t(\tau)$ of
events, as the branching ratio (defined as the average number of triggered
events of first generation per source) tends to 1. The derivation uses the
formalism of generating probability functions. The corresponding prediction is
confirmed by numerical calculations and an heuristic derivation enlightens its
underlying mechanism. We also show that ${\bar R}_t(\tau)$ is always linear in
$\nu \tau$ even at criticality ($n=1$). Our results thus illustrate the
fundamental difference between the mean total number, which is controlled by a
few extremely rare realizations, and the typical behavior represented by

investigated by analyzing Surface Evolver simulations of spatially periodic

rearrangements (T1s) that occur when Plateau's laws are violated; the first T1s
occur at the elastic limit and at large strains frequent cascades of T1s,
composed of one or more individual T1s, sustain the yield-stress plateau. The
stress and shape anisotropy of individual cells is quantified by $Q$, a scalar
measure derived from the interface tensor that gauges each cell's contribution
to the global stress. During each T1 cascade, the connected set of cells with
decreasing $Q$, called the \textit{stress release domain}, is network-like and
highly non-local. Geometrically, the network-like nature of the stress release
domains is corroborated through morphological analysis using the Euler
characteristic. The stress release domain is distinctly different from the set
of cells that change topology during a T1 cascade. Our results highlight the
unique rheological behavior of foams, where complex large-scale cooperative
rearrangements of foam cells are observed as a consequence of distinctly local
events.

composed of iron, either bound within metal (mainly Fe-Ni), or iron sulfide.
Recent results from the MESSENGER mission to Mercury imply a low temperature
history of the planet which questions the standard formation models of impact
mantle stripping or evaporation to explain the high metal content. Like
Mercury, the two smallest extrasolar rocky planets with mass and size
determination, CoRoT-7b and Kepler-10b, were found to be of high density. As
they orbit close to their host stars this indicates that iron rich inner
planets might not be a nuisance of the solar system but be part of a general
scheme of planet formation. From undifferentiated chondrites it is also known
that the metal to silicate ratio is highly variable which must be ascribed to
pre-planetary fractionation processes. Due to this fractionation most
chondritic parent bodies - most of them originated in the asteroid belt - are
depleted in iron relative to average solar system abundances. The astrophysical
processes leading to metal silicate fractionation in the solar nebula are
essentially unknown. Here, we consider photophoretic forces. As these forces
particularly act on irradiated solids, they might play a significant role for
the composition of planetesimals forming at the inner edge of protoplanetary
discs. Photophoresis can separate high thermal conductivity materials (iron)
from lower thermal conductivity solids (silicate). We suggest that the
silicates are preferentially pushed into the optical thick disk. Subsequent
planetesimal formation at the edge moving outwards leads to metal rich
planetesimals close to the star and metal depleted planetesimals further out in
the nebula.

attention in recent years. In many cases, however, existing methods (for

and without carefully considering the interpretation of a fuzzy set when being

interpretation of fuzzy set-valued data, and focusing on the latter, we argue
that a ""fuzzification"" of learning algorithms based on an application of the
generic extension principle is not appropriate. In fact, the extension
principle fails to properly exploit the inductive bias underlying statistical
and machine learning methods, although this bias, at least in principle, offers
a means for ""disambiguating"" the fuzzy data. Alternatively, we therefore
propose a method which is based on the generalization of loss functions in
empirical risk minimization, and which performs model identification and data
disambiguation simultaneously. Elaborating on the fuzzification of specific
types of losses, we establish connections to well-known loss functions in
regression and classification. We compare our approach with related methods and

incremental inverted indexing algorithm for web-scale collections that directly
constructs compressed postings lists in memory. Designing efficient in-memory
algorithms requires understanding modern processor architectures and memory
hierarchies: in this paper, we explore the issue of postings lists contiguity.
Naturally, postings lists that occupy contiguous memory regions are preferred
for retrieval, but maintaining contiguity increases complexity and slows
indexing. On the other hand, allowing discontiguous index segments simplifies
index construction but decreases retrieval performance. Understanding this
tradeoff is our main contribution: We find that co-locating small groups of
inverted list segments yields query evaluation performance that is
statistically indistinguishable from fully-contiguous postings lists. In other
words, it is not necessary to lay out in-memory data structures such that all
postings for a term are contiguous; we can achieve ideal performance with a
relatively small amount of effort.

  from a Gaussian Bayesian network","technical report",,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Methodological development for the inference of gene regulatory networks from
transcriptomic data is an active and important research area. Several
approaches have been proposed to infer relationships among genes from
observational steady-state expression data alone, mainly based on the use of
graphical Gaussian models. However, these methods rely on the estimation of
partial correlations and are only able to provide undirected graphs that cannot
highlight causal relationships among genes. A major upcoming challenge is to
jointly analyze observational transcriptomic data and intervention data
obtained by performing knock-out or knock-down experiments in order to uncover
causal gene regulatory relationships. To this end, in this technical note we
present an explicit formula for the likelihood function for any complex
intervention design in the context of Gaussian Bayesian networks, as well as
its analytical maximization. This allows a direct calculation of the causal
effects for known graph structure. We also show how to obtain the Fisher
information in this context, which will be extremely useful for the choice of
optimal intervention designs in the future.

from two or more separate urns in which the same $n$ distinct categories of

apply the theory to the intersection of genes belonging to a set of traits in

this is not possible when relying on intersection sizes alone. In addition,
intersection distributions provide a means to test for co-localization of
objects in images when using discretized data, allowing co-localization tests
in more than two channels. Finally, I show how to extend the problem to
variable numbers of objects belonging to each category, and discuss how to make
further progress in this direction. The distribution functions are implemented

the original idea of Deam and Edwards, we consider an instantaneous
crosslinking process, where all crosslinkers (modeled as Gaussian springs) are
introduced randomly at once in an equilibrium liquid state, referred to as the
preparation state. The probability that two functional sites are crosslinked by
a spring exponentially decreases with their distance squared. After formally
averaging over network connectivity, we obtained an effective theory with all
degrees of freedom replicated 1 + n times. Two thermodynamic ensembles, the
preparation ensemble and the measurement ensemble, naturally appear in this
theory. The former describes the thermodynamic fluctuations in the state of
preparation, while the latter describes the thermodynamic fluctuations in the
state of measurement. We classify various correlation functions and discuss
their physical significances. In particular, the memory correlation functions
characterize how the properties of networks depend on their history of
formation, and are the hallmark properties of all randomly crosslinked
materials. We clarify the essential difference between our approach and that of
Deam-Edwards, discuss the saddle-point order parameters and its physical
significance. Finally we also discuss the connection between saddle-point
approximation of vulcanization theory, and the classical theory of rubber
elasticity as well as the neo-classical theory of nematic elastomers.

from the first crossing distributions of physically motivated barriers by
random walks with correlated steps. We write the first crossing distribution as
a formal series, ordered by the number of times a walk upcrosses the barrier.
Since the fraction of walks with many upcrossings is negligible if the walk has
not taken many steps, the leading order term in this series is the most
relevant for understanding the massive objects of most interest in cosmology.
This first term only requires knowledge of the bivariate distribution of the
walk height and slope, and provides an excellent approximation to the first
crossing distribution for all barriers and smoothing filters of current
interest. We show that this simplicity survives when extending the approach to
the case of non-Gaussian random fields. For non-Gaussian fields which are
obtained by deterministic transformations of a Gaussian, the first crossing
distribution is simply related to that for Gaussian walks crossing a suitably
rescaled barrier. Our analysis shows that this is a useful way to think of the
generic case as well. Although our study is motivated by the possibility that
the primordial fluctuation field was non-Gaussian, our results are general. In
particular, they do not assume the non-Gaussianity is small, so they may be
viewed as the solution to an excursion set analysis of the late-time, nonlinear
fluctuation field rather than the initial one. They are also useful for models
in which the barrier height is determined by quantities other than the initial
density, since most other physically motivated variables (such as the shear)
are usually stochastic and non-Gaussian. We use the Lognormal transformation to
illustrate some of our arguments.

properties of the integrated system. Results are consistent with available

suggest that primary hypertension can be attributed to a mechanogenic etiology
without challenging current conceptions of renal and sympathetic nervous system

near realtime information on the energy consumption of individual users, smart
meters increase the efficiency in generation, distribution and storage of

energy consumption inevitably leads to important threats to privacy. In this
paper, privacy in a smart metering system is studied from an information
theoretic perspective in the presence of energy harvesting and storage units.
It is shown that energy harvesting provides increased privacy by diversifying
the energy source, while a storage device can be used to increase both the
energy efficiency and the privacy of the user. For given input load and energy
harvesting rates, it is shown that there exists a trade-off between the
information leakage rate, which is used to measure the privacy of the user, and
the wasted energy rate, which is a measure of the energy-efficiency. The impact
of the energy harvesting rate and the size of the storage device on this
trade-off is also studied.

problem of early immune response is considered as a case-study. Rounds of
evolution with different constraints uncover elaborations of the same network
motif we name adaptive sorting. Corresponding network substructures can be
identified in current models of immune recognition. Our work draws a deep
analogy between immune recognition and biochemical adaptation.

emulating expensive computer simulators. Fitting a GP model can be numerically
unstable if any pair of design points in the input space are close together.
Ranjan, Haynes, and Karsten (2011) proposed a computationally stable approach
for fitting GP models to deterministic computer simulators. They used a genetic
algorithm based approach that is robust but computationally intensive for
maximizing the likelihood. This paper implements a slightly modified version of
the model proposed by Ranjan et al. (2011), as the new R package GPfit. A novel
parameterization of the spatial correlation function and a new multi-start
gradient based optimization algorithm yield optimization that is robust and
typically faster than the genetic algorithm based approach. We present two
examples with R codes to illustrate the usage of the main functions in GPfit.
Several test functions are used for performance comparison with a popular R
package mlegp. GPfit is a free software and distributed under the general
public license, as part of the R software project (R Development Core Team
2012).

Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) gravity. The gravitational field
equations are investigated for a spherically symmetric dark matter galactic
halo, by adopting a phenomenological tangential velocity profile for test
particles moving in stable circular orbits around the galactic center. The
density profile and the mass distribution, as well as the general form of the
metric tensor is obtained by numerically integrating the gravitational field
equations, and in an approximate analytical form by using the Newtonian limit
of the theory. In the weak field limit the dark matter density distribution is
described by the Lane-Emden equation with polytropic index $n=1$, and is
non-singular at the galactic center. The parameter $\kappa $ of the theory is
determined so that that the theory could provide a realistic description of the
dark matter halos. The gravitational properties of the dark matter halos are
also briefly discussed in the Newtonian approximation.

exhibit selfsimilar space-time fractal fluctuations generic to dynamical
systems in nature such as fluid flows, spread of forest fires, earthquakes,
etc. The power spectra of fractal fluctuations display inverse power-law form
signifying long-range correlations. The author has developed a general systems
theory which predicts universal inverse power-law form incorporating the golden
mean for the fractal fluctuations of all size scales, i.e., small, large and
extreme values. The model predicted distribution is in close agreement with
observed fractal fluctuations in the historic month-wise temperature (maximum
and minimum) and rainfall in the UK region. The present study suggests that
fractal fluctuations result from the superimposition of an eddy continuum
fluctuations. The observed extreme values result from superimposition of maxima
(or minima) of dominant eddies (waves) in the eddy continuum.

1917) founds the theory of gas lasers. It is, for the understanding of
universe, a simpler and more powerful tool than the big bang which requires
questionable supplements (dark matter, MOND, etc..). The Impulsive Stimulated
Raman Scattering (ISRS) redshifts gradually light pulses which cross excited
atomic hydrogen H*, so that the redshift is a measure of the column density of
H*. Thus, the distance of the hot stars, surrounded by much H*, is exaggerated
by the use of Hubble's law. Local exaggerated distances create voids in the
maps of galaxies which become spongy. The interpretation of spectra of quasars,
the periodicity of galaxy redshifts introduce an experimental ""Karlsson's
constant"" exactly computed by ISRS. The need for dark matter comes from the
exaggeration of the distance, therefore the size of galaxies. Without dark
matter, celestial mechanics provides a reliable distance of spiral galaxies.
Coherence also introduces superradiance and mode competition that explain that
only the limbs of Str\""omgren spheres are visible as circles maybe punctuated
by an even number of dots: Too numerous, the figures assigned to gravitational
lenses can be such limbs. The coincidence of the ignition of the rings of
SNR1987A with the extinction of the star is due to a multiphoton coherent
scattering of star light, which amplifies the superradiant emission of the
rings.. A blueshift of microwaves crossing H* resulting, between 10 and 15 AU,
of the expansion of solar wind, explains the ""anomalous acceleration"" of
Pioneer probes. All is obtained without any change in theories of standard
spectroscopy.

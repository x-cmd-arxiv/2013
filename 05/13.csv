A much clearer presentation",,,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This is the first of two papers which study the behavior of the SU(2)
holonomies of loop quantum gravity (LQG), when they are acted upon by a
unidirectional, plane gravity wave. Initially, the LQG flux-holonomy variables
are treated as classical, commuting functions rather than quantized operators,
in a limit where variation from vertex to vertex are small and fields are weak.
Despite the weakness of the fields, the field equations are not linear. Also,
the theory can be quantized, and the expectation values of the quantum
operators behave like their classical analogs. Exact LQG theories may be either
local or non-local. The present paper argues that a wide class of non-local
theories share non-local features which survive to the semiclassical limit, and
these non-local features are included in the classical limit studied here. An
appendix computes the surface term required when the propagation direction is
the real line rather than $\mathrm{S}_1$. Paper II introduces coherent states,
constructs a damped sine wave solution to the constraints, and solves for the
behavior of the holonomies in the presence of the wave.

equations of loop quantum gravity (LQG). There is an SU(2) holonomy on each
edge of the LQG simplex, and the goal is to study the behavior of these
holonomies under the influence of a passing gravitational wave. The equations
are solved in a small sine approximation: holonomies are expanded in powers of
sines, and terms beyond $\sin^2$ are dropped; also, fields vary slowly from
vertex to vertex. The wave is unidirectional and linearly polarized. The
Hilbert space is spanned by a set of coherent states tailored to the symmetry
of the plane wave case. Fixing the spatial diffeomorphisms is equivalent to
fixing the spatial interval between vertices of the loop quantum gravity
lattice. This spacing can be chosen such that the eigenvalues of the triad
operators are large, as required in the small sine limit, even though the
holonomies are not large. Appendices compute the energy of the wave, estimate
the lifetime of the coherent state packet, discuss coarse-graining, and
determine the behavior of the spinors used in the U(N) SHO realization of LQG.

variability in the UV wind lines of the pulsating B1 IV star beta Cep are
similar to what is observed in magnetic He-peculiar B stars, suggesting that
beta Cep is magnetic. We searched for a magnetic field using
spectropolarimetry. From UV spectroscopy, we analysed the wind variability and
investigated the correlation with the magnetic data. Using 130 time-resolved
circular polarisation spectra, obtained with the MuSiCoS spectropolarimeter at
the 2m TBL from 1998 until 2005, we applied the least-squares deconvolution
method on the Stokes V spectra and derived the longitudinal component of the
integrated magnetic field over the visible hemisphere of the star. We performed
a period analysis on the magnetic data and on EW measurements of UV wind lines
obtained over 17 years. We also analysed the short- and long-term radial
velocity variations, which are due to the pulsations and the 90-year binary
motion. beta Cep hosts a sinusoidally varying magnetic field with an amplitude
97(4) G and an average value -6(3) G. From the UV wind line variability, we
derive a period of 12.00075(11) days, which is the rotation period of the star,
and is compatible with the observed magnetic modulation. Phases of maximum and
minimum field match those of maximum emission in the UV wind lines, strongly
supporting an oblique magnetic-rotator model. We discuss the magnetic behaviour
as a function of pulsation behaviour and UV line variability. This paper
presents the analysis of the first confirmed detection of a dipolar magnetic
field in an upper main-sequence pulsating star. Maximum wind absorption
originates in the magnetic equatorial plane. Maximum emission occurs when the
magnetic north pole points to the Earth. Radial velocities agree with the ~90-y
orbit around its Be-star binary companion.

CoFeB/MgO magnetic tunnel junction in order to prevent the impedance mismatch
issue. A clear electromotive force was measured in Ge at the ferromagnetic
resonance of CoFeB. The same study was then carried out on several test
samples, in particular we have investigated the influence of the MgO tunnel
barrier and sample annealing on the ISHE signal. First, the reference CoFeB/MgO
bilayer grown on SiO$_{2}$ exhibits a clear electromotive force due to
anisotropic magnetoresistance and anomalous Hall effect which is dominated by
an asymmetric contribution with respect to the resonance field. We also found
that the MgO tunnel barrier is essential to observe ISHE in Ge and that sample
annealing systematically lead to an increase of the signal. We propose a
theoretical model based on the presence of localized states at the interface
between the MgO tunnel barrier and Ge to account for these observations.
Finally, all of our results are fully consistent with the observation of ISHE
in heavily doped $n$-Ge and we could estimate the spin Hall angle at room

implemented by the action of a projection P on the Dirac operator D and/or on
the algebra A. This action induces two new distances. We individuate conditions
making them equivalent to the original distance. We also study the
Gromov-Hausdorff limit of the set of truncated states, first for compact
quantum metric spaces in the sense of Rieffel, then for arbitrary spectral
triples. To this aim, we introduce a notion of ""state with finite moment of
order 1"" for noncommutative algebras. We then focus on the commutative case,
and show that the cut-off induces a minimal length between points, which is
infinite if P has finite rank. When P is a spectral projection of $D$, we work
out an approximation of points by non-pure states that are at finite distance
from each other. On the circle, such approximations are given by Fejer
probability distributions. Finally we apply the results to Moyal plane and the
fuzzy sphere, obtained as Berezin quantization of the plane and the sphere

with sub-Angstrom spatial resolution of the early nuclear and multielectron
dynamics in molecules. It involves strong field ionization of the molecule by
the IR laser field followed by time-delayed recombination of the removed
electron with the molecular ion. The time-delay is controlled on the attosecond
time scale by the oscillation of the IR field and is mapped into the harmonic
number, providing a movie of molecular dynamics between ionization and
recombination. One of the challenges in the analysis of high harmonic signal
stems from the fact that the complex dynamics of both ionization and
recombination with their multiple observables are entangled in the harmonic
signal. Disentangling this information requires multidimensional approach,
capable of mapping ionization and recombination dynamics into different
independent parameters. We suggest multidimensional high harmonic spectroscopy
as a tool for characterizing of ionization and recombination processes
separately allowing for simultaneous detection of both the ionization delays
and sub-cycle ionization rates. Our method extends the capability of the two
dimensional (2D) set-up suggested recently by Shafir et al on reconstructing
ionization delays, while keeping the reconstruction procedure as simple as in
the original proposal. The scheme is based on the optimization of the high

presence of a massive black hole. The redistribution may be determined using an
approach pioneered by Gondolo and Silk: begin with a model distribution
function for the dark matter, and ``grow'' the black hole adiabatically,
holding the adiabatic invariants of the motion constant. Unlike the approach of
Gondolo and Silk, which adopted Newtonian theory together with ad hoc
correction factors to mimic general relativistic effects, we carry out the
calculation fully relativistically, using the exact Schwarzschild geometry of
the black hole. We find that the density of dark matter generically vanishes at
r=2R_S, not 4R_S as found by Gondolo and Silk, where R_S is the Schwarzschild
radius, and that the spike very close to the black hole reaches significantly
higher densities. We apply the relativistic adiabatic growth framework to
obtain the final dark matter density for both cored and cusped initial
distributions. Besides the implications of these results for indirect detection
estimates, we show that the gravitational effects of such a dark matter spike
are significantly smaller than the relativistic effects of the black hole,
including frame dragging and quadrupolar effects, for stars orbiting close to
the black hole that might be candidates for testing the black hole no-hair
theorems.

the following conclusion: (1) We define the detached group, DG, as objects
sublimating water that have aphelion distances Q < 4.5 AU. The detached group
contains all the ABCs traditionally recognized, plus a few other members like
2P and 107P. With the above definition there are 11 members of the ABC group:
2P, 107P, 133P, 176P, 233P, 238P, C/2008 R1, C/2010 R2, 2011 CR42, 3200, and
300163 = 2006 VW139. (2) Active objects sublimate ices except collisioned
asteroids, CA, P/2010 A2, 596 Scheila, and P/2012 F5 Gibbs, and 3200 Phaethon
who was active due to sputtering. (3)We have calibrated the black body (color)
temperature of comets vs perihelion distance, R. We find T = 325+-5 K/SQRT(R).
(4) Using a mathematical model of the thermal wave we calculate the thickness
of the dust layer on comet nuclei as 2.0+-0.5 m for comet 107P, 4.7+-1.2 m for
comet 133P and 1.9+-0.5 m for a sample of 9 comets. (5) We have located three
ABCs in an evolutionary diagram of Remaining Revolutions, RR, vs Water-Budget
Age, WB-AGE. ABCs lie together in the upper right hand corner of the diagram.
(6) RR vs WB-AGE defines the region of the graveyard of comets, objects with
1000 cy < WB-AGE (cy stands for comet years). Five members belong to the
graveyard, 107P, 133P, 2006 VW139, D/1891 W1 Blanpain and 3200 Phaeton. Thus we
propose that the asteroidal belt contains an enormous graveyard of ancient
dormant and extinct rocky comets, that turn on (are rejuvenated), in response
to a diminution of their perihelion distance.

$(k,m)$-connectivity in mobile clustered wireless networks, in which there are
$n$ mobile cluster members and $n^d$ static cluster heads, where $k,m,d$ are
all positive constants and $k\leq m$. $(k,m)$-connectivity signifies that in a
time period consisting of $m$ time slots, there exist at least $k$ time slots
for each cluster member and in any one of these $k$ time slots the cluster
member can directly communicate with at least one cluster head. We investigate
the critical transmission range of asymptotic $(k,m)$-connectivity when cluster
members move according to random walk or i.i.d. mobility model. Under random
walk mobility, we propose two general heterogeneous velocity models in which
cluster members may move with different velocities. Under both mobility models,
we also define weak and strong parameters conditions, resulting in different
accuracies of evaluations on the probability that the network is asymptotically
$(k,m)$-connected, denoted as $P(\mathcal {C})$ below for simplicity. For both
mobilities, under weak parameters condition, we provide bounds on $P(\mathcal
{C})$ and derive the critical transmission range for $(k,m)$-connectivity. For
random walk mobility with one kind of velocity model and i.i.d. mobility, under
strong parameters condition, we present a precise asymptotic probability
distribution of $P(\mathcal {C})$ in terms of the transmission radius. Our
results offer fundamental insights and theoretical guidelines on design of
large-scale wireless networks.

emission by GRBs. We then exploit this richness for a search of spectral lags,
of the type that has been recently of interest for its relevance in
quantum-spacetime research. We do find some evidence of systematic soft
spectral lags: when confining the analysis to photons of energies greater than
5 GeV there is an early hard development of minibursts within this long burst.
The effect turns out to be well characterized quantitatively by a linear
dependence, within such a miniburst, of the detection time on energy. With the
guidance of our findings for GRB130427A we can then recognize that some support
for these features is noticeable also in earlier Fermi-LAT GRBs, particularly
for the presence of hard minibursts whose onset is marked by the highest-energy
photon observed for the GRB. A comparison of these features for GRBs at
different redshifts provides some encouragement for a redshift dependence of
the effects of the type expected for a quantum-spacetime interpretation, but
other aspects of the analysis appear to invite the interpretation as intrinsic

high molecular weight atmosphere. In particular, it is unclear if hydrogen and
helium are present or if the atmosphere is water dominated. Here, we present
results on the composition of the envelope obtained by using an internal
structure and evolutionary model to fit the mass and radius data. By examining
all possible mixtures of water and H/He, with the corresponding opacities, we
find that the bulk amount of H/He of GJ1214b is at most 7% by mass. In general,
we find the radius of warm sub-Neptunes to be most sensitive to the amount of
H/He. We note that all (Kepler-11b,c,d,f, Kepler-18b, Kepler-20b, 55Cnc-e,
Kepler-36c and Kepler-68b) but two (Kepler-11e and Kepler-30b) of the
discovered low-mass planets so far have less than 10% H/He. In fact, Kepler-11e
and Kepler-30b have 10-18% and 5-15% bulk H/He. Conversely, little can be
determined about the H2O or rocky content of sub-Neptune planets. We find that
although a 100% water composition fits the data for GJ1214b, based on formation
constraints the presence of heavier refractory material on this planet is
expected, and hence, so is a component lighter than water required. A robust
determination by transmission spectroscopy of the composition of the upper
atmosphere of GJ1214b will help determine the extent of compositional
segregation between the atmosphere and envelope.

Riesz basis of $L^2(\Omega)$. This result was recently proved by Grepstad and
Lev under the extra assumption that $\Omega$ has boundary of measure 0, using
methods from the theory of quasicrystals. Our approach is rather more
elementary and is based almost entirely on linear algebra. The set of
frequencies $T$ turns out to be a finite union of shifted copies of the dual
lattice $\Lambda^*$. It can be chosen knowing only $\Lambda$ and $k$ and is the
same for all $\Omega$ that tile multiply with $\Lambda$.

We employ a two-chain approach, in which a trial chain is used to adapt the

strong law of large numbers are proved under reasonable conditions, and without
imposing a Diminishing Adaptation condition. The mixtures of multivariate t

the symmetry point of view. In this picture, unlike the Standard Model, the
symmetry is not only left-right symmetric, but each left handed fermion
multiplet is accompanied by new right handed fermion multiplet of opposite
chirality. In this work, we consider a gauge symmetry, $SU(3)_c \otimes
SU(2)_L\otimes SU(2)_R \otimes U(1)_{Y^\prime}$ supplemented by a discrete
$Z_2$ symmetry. Instead of having right handed multiplets for each left handed
multiplets of the same fermions as in the usual left-right model, the mirror
model include right handed doublets involving new fermions (called mirrors),
and similarly for each right handed singlet, there are corresponding mirror
singlets. Thus the gauge anomaly is naturally absent in this model, and the
model also provide a solution for the strong CP problem because of parity
conservation. The first stage of symmetry breaking is achieved by a doublet
mirror Higgs with a vacuum expectation value $\simeq 10^7$ GeV, needed to
explain the neutrino mass $\simeq 10^{-11}$ GeV. The mirror fermions can mix
with the ordinary fermions via a scalar which is singlet under the gauge
symmetry. In this model, only light mirror particles, having masses in the few
hundred GeV range are $\hat{e}, \hat{u}, \hat{d}$ with well-defined spectrum.
$\hat{u}$ and $\hat{d}$ can be pair produced at the LHC, and can be detected as
($u Z$) and ($d Z$) resonances. We discuss the signals of these mirror fermions
at the LHC, and find that the reach at the LHC can be as large as $m_{\hat

minimum mean square error (MMSE) linear detection strategy and employ a cyclic
prefix. In the SCE scheme, we perform the adaptive channel estimation in the
frequency domain and implement the despreading in the time domain after the
FDE. In this scheme, the MMSE detection requires the knowledge of the number of
users and the noise variance. For this purpose, we propose simple algorithms
for estimating these parameters. In the DA scheme, the interference suppression
task is fulfilled with only one adaptive filter in the frequency domain and a
new signal expression is adopted to simplify the design of such a filter.
Least-mean squares (LMS), recursive least squares (RLS) and conjugate gradient
(CG) adaptive algorithms are then developed for both schemes. A complexity
analysis compares the computational complexity of the proposed algorithms and

analytic on a compact interval except at the endpoints. Typical numerical
methods for approximating such functions depend upon the use of particular
conformal maps from the original interval to either a semi-infinite or an
infinite interval, followed by an appropriate approximation procedure on the
new region. We first analyse the convergence of these existing methods and show
that, in a precisely defined sense, they are sub-optimal. Specifically, they
exhibit poor resolution properties, by which we mean that many more degrees of
freedom are required to resolve oscillatory functions than standard
approximation schemes for analytic functions such as Chebyshev interpolation.
  To remedy this situation, we introduce two new transforms; one for each of
the above settings. We provide full convergence results for these new
approximations and then demonstrate that, for a particular choice of
parameters, these methods lead to substantially better resolution properties.
Finally, we show that optimal resolution power can be achieved by an
appropriate choice of parameters, provided one forfeits classical convergence.
Instead, the resulting method attains a finite, but user-controlled accuracy
specified by the parameter choice.

propagates all the way down to the center, trailing behind it the C-shell

is obtained in stellar evolution simulations if the bottom C-shell convection
boundary is assumed to be a discontinuity associated with a strict
interpretation of the Schwarzschild condition for convective instability.
However, this boundary is prone to additional mixing processes, such as
thermohaline convection and convective boundary mixing. Using hydrodynamic
simulations we show that, contrary to previous results, thermohaline mixing is
too inefficient to interfere with the C-flame propagation. However, even a
small amount of convective boundary mixing removes the physical conditions
required for the C-flame propagation all the way to the center. This result
holds even if we allow for some turbulent heat transport in the CBM region. As
a result, super AGB stars build in their interiors hybrid C-O-Ne degenerate
cores composed of a relatively large CO core (M_CO ~ 0.2 M_sun) surrounded by a
thick ONe zone (M_ONe ~ 0.85 M_sun) with another thin CO layer above. If
exposed by mass loss, these cores will become hybrid C-O-Ne white dwarfs.
Otherwise, the ignition of C-rich material in the central core, surrounded by
the thick ONe zone, may trigger a thermonuclear supernova explosion. The
quenching of the C-flame may have implications for the ignition mechanism of SN
Ia in the double-degenerate merger scenario.

strategy that guarantees overall system stability. This method differs
significantly from previous approaches to guaranteeing overall stability, which
have relied upon a multi-rate framework where the inner loop (low level) is
updated at a faster rate than the outer loop (high level), and the inner loop
must reach a steady-state within each outer loop time step. In contrast, the
method proposed in this paper is aimed at stabilizing the origin of an error
system characterized by the difference between the inner loop state and the
state specified by a full-order reference model. This makes the method
applicable to systems with reduced levels of time scale separation. This paper
proposes a framework for guaranteeing stability that leverages the use of the
reference model, in conjunction with lambda-contractive constraint sets for
both the inner and outer loops. The effectiveness of the proposed reference
model-based strategy is shown through simulation on an existing stirred tank

studied based on a large set of N-body simulations of clusters with a range of
initial masses, initial concentrations, in circular or elliptical orbits in
different tidal environments. Models with and without initial mass segregation
are included. The depletion of low mass stars in initially Roche-volume (tidal)
filling clusters starts typically on a time scale of the order of the core
collapse time. In clusters that are initially underfilling their Roche-volume
it takes longer because the clusters have to expand to their tidal radii before
dynamical mass loss becomes important.
  We introduce the concept of the differential mass function (DMF), which
describes the changes with respect to the initial mass function (IMF). We show
that the evolution of the DMF can be described by a set of very simple analytic
expressions that are valid for a wide range of initial cluster parameters and
for different IMFs. The agreement between this description and the models is
very good, except for initially Roche-volume underfilling clusters that are

different sizes of breasts. The dose deviations caused by using cylindrical

stability, the CTDIw is suitable for dose evaluations in daily clinical

two-dimensional antiferromagnetic (AF) spin fluctuations are dominant. The
successful description of the crossover feature from non-Fermi liquid to Fermi
liquid behavior strongly suggests that low-lying spin fluctuations in
BaFe2(As1-xPx)2 and Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 possess an itinerant AF nature, and that
chemical substitution in the two compounds tunes the distance of these systems
to an AF quantum critical point. The close relationship between spin
fluctuations and superconductivity is discussed compared with the other
unconventional superconductors, cuprate and heavy fermion superconductors. In
addition, it is suggested that magnetism and lattice instability in these

SARS-CoV (huSARS-CoV) originated directly from bats, rather than civets, by a
cross-species jump in 1991, and formed a human-adapted strain in 1998. Since
then huSARS-CoV has evolved further into highly virulent strains with genotype
T and a 29-nt deletion mutation, and weakly virulent strains with genotype C
but without the 29-nt deletion. The former can cause pneumonia in humans and
could be the major causative pathogen of the SARS outbreak, whereas the latter
might not cause pneumonia in humans, but evolved the ability to co-utilize
civet ACE2 as an entry receptor, leading to interspecies transmission between
humans and civets. Three crucial time points - 1991, for the cross-species jump
from bats to humans; 1998, for the formation of the human-adapted SARS-CoV; and
2003, when there was an outbreak of SARS in humans - were found to associate
with anomalously low annual precipitation and high temperatures in Guangdong.
Anti-SARS-CoV sero-positivity was detected in 20% of all the samples tested
from Guangzhou children who were born after 2005, suggesting that weakly
virulent huSARS-CoVs might still exist in humans. These existing but undetected
SARS-CoVs have a large potential to evolve into highly virulent strains when
favorable climate conditions occur, highlighting a potential risk for the

the singlet algebras M(p) and the triplet algebras W(p), as well as the
ubiquitous symplectic fermions theory. In this work, these algebras are
realized through a coset construction.
  The W^(2)_n algebra of level k was introduced by Feigin and Semikhatov as a
(conjectured) quantum hamiltonian reduction of affine sl(n)_k, generalising the
Bershadsky-Polyakov algebra W^(2)_3. Inspired by work of Adamovic for p=3,
vertex algebras B_p are constructed as subalgebras of the kernel of certain
screening charges acting on a rank 2 lattice vertex algebra of indefinite
signature. It is shown that for p <= 5, the algebra B_p is a homomorphic image
of W^(2)_{p-1} at level -(p-1)^2 / p and that the known part of the operator
product algebra of the latter algebra is consistent with this holding for p>5
as well. The triplet algebra W(p) is then realised as a coset inside the full
kernel of the screening operator, while the singlet algebra M(p) is similarly
realised inside B_p. As an application, and to illustrate these results, the
coset character decompositions are explicitly worked out for p=2 and 3.

with B59#11, which is oriented perpendicular to the outflow axis. There is a
compact dust condensation with a size of 350x180 AU seen in the SMA 1.3 mm
continuum map, and the direction of its major axis is almost the same as that
of the dense gas elongation. The distributions of 13CO and C18O emission also
show the velocity gradients along their major axes, which are considered to
arise from the envelope/disk rotation. From the detailed analysis of the SMA

less than 350 AU. In addition, the SMA CO(2--1) image shows a velocity gradient
in the outflow along the same direction as that of the dense gas rotation. We
suggest that this velocity gradient shows a rotation of the outflow.

from analytical and numerical analysis that the distance between a

explicit model system we develop a general theory for the interactions between
a TF and a transcription unit. The observed variations in regulation efficiency

support the role of rapid binding site search for gene colocalization and

M\'ethodes nouvelles de la m\'ecanique c\'eleste. The latter's approach to the
three-body-problem has often been celebrated as a starting point of chaos
theory in relation to the investigation of dynamical systems. Yet, the novelty
of Poincar\'e's strategy can also be analyzed as having been cast out some
specific algebraic practices for manipulating systems of linear equations. As
the structure of a cast-iron building may be less noticeable than its creative
fa\c{c}ade, the algebraic cast of Poincar\'e's strategy was broken out of the
mold in generating the new methods of celestial mechanics. But as the various
components that are mixed in some casting process can still be detected in the
resulting alloy, this algebraic cast points to some collective dimensions of
the M\'ethodes nouvelles. It thus allow to analyze Poincar\'e's individual
creativity in regard with the collective dimensions of some algebraic cultures.
At a global scale, Poincar\'e's strategy is a testimony of the pervading
influence of what used to play the role of a shared algebraic culture in the
19th century, i.e., much before the development of linear algebra as a specific
discipline. This shared culture was usually identified by references to the
''equation to the secular inequalities in planetary theory.'' This form of
identification highlights the long shadow of the great treatises of mechanics
published at the end of the 18th century. At a more local scale, Poincar\'e's
approach can be analyzed in regard with the specific evolution that Hermite's
algebraic theory of forms impulsed to the culture of the secular equation.
Moreover, this papers shows that some specific aspects of Poincar\'e's own
creativity result from a process of acculturation of the latter to Jordan's
practices of reductions of linear substitutions within the local algebraic
culture anchored in Hermite's legacy .

strictly derivative- free yet directed through an additive update term based
purely on the statistical moments of the design variables, is proposed for
nonlinear inverse problems in general and applied in particular to an optical
imaging problem, the ultrasound modulated optical tomography (UMOT). The
additive update term, which bypasses most pitfalls of a conventional weight-
based Bayesian update, results from a change of measures aimed at driving
appropriately derived observation-prediction error terms or increments of cost
functionals to zero-mean Brownian martingales. This constitutes a novel
characterization corresponding to the extremization of the cost functional(s),
where the design unknowns are represented as diffusion processes evolving with
respect to a continuously parameterized iteration variable. This leads to a
recursive prediction-update algorithm to implement the search. The scheme
offers freedom from sample degeneracy and the accompanying divergence of the
conventional weight-based Bayesian update schemes. We obtain the order of
convergence of the conditioned process and also establish that the solutions
are stable against tolerable variations in the regularizing noise terms, even
as the original inverse problem remains severely ill-posed. Numerical evidence
on solutions to the UMOT problem also confirms substantive improvements in the
reconstruction efficacy through the proposed method vis-\`a- vis a Gauss-Newton
approach, especially where the regularized quasi-Newton direction has low
sensitivity to variations in the design unknowns.

by adding a quadrupole on the monopole component. The basic properties of the
SIQ lens have been studied in this paper, including deflection potential,
deflection angle, magnification, critical curve, caustic, pseudo-caustic and
transition locus. Analytical solutions of the image positions and
magnifications for the source on axes are derived. As have been found, naked
cusps will appear when the relative intensity $k$ of quadrupole to monopole is
larger than 0.6. According to the magnification invariant theory of the SIQ
lens, the sum of the signed magnifications of the four images should be equal
to unity \citep{dal98}. However, if a source lies in the naked cusp, the summed
magnification of the left three images is smaller than the invariant 1. With
this simple lens system, we study the situations that a point source infinitely
approaches a cusp or a fold. The sum of magnifications of cusp image triplet is
usually not equal to 0, and it is usually positive for major cusp while
negative for minor cusp. Similarly, the sum of magnifications of fold image
pair is usually neither equal to 0. Nevertheless, the cusp and fold relations
are still equal to 0, in that the sum values are divided by infinite absolute
magnifications by definition.

information over exploding cloud of Internet. The standard router redundancy
protocol is used to handle backup links however it cannot aggregate them.
Whereas the link standard aggregation protocol can aggregate the link but it
support only Ethernet technology. In this research paper a concept of Redundant
Link Aggregation (RLA) is proposed. RLA can aggregate and handle backup links
with main links regardless of carrier technology. Furthermore a data forwarding
mechanism Odd Load Balancing (OLB) is also proposed for RLA scheme. For the
sake of performance evaluation, Redundant Link Aggregation (RLA) is compared
with Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP). The simulation result reveals
that Redundant Link Aggregation (RLA) can cover the bandwidth demand of the
network in peak hours by consuming backup links as well which with Virtual
Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) cannot. It is further noted that Odd Load

spin-transfer-torque in magnetic tunnel junctions. Experimental data on the
current-induced switching in junctions with MgO tunnel barrier reveal a random
back-and-forth switching between the magnetization states, which appears when
the current direction favors the parallel magnetic configuration. The effect
depends on the barrier thickness $t_b$, and is not observed in tunnel junctions
with very thin MgO tunnel barriers, $t_b$ $<$ 0.95 nm. Switching dependence on
the bias voltage and barrier thickness is explained in terms of the macrospin
model, with the magnetization dynamics described by the modified
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. Numerical simulations indicate that the
competition between in-plane and out-of-plane torque components can result at
high bias voltages in a non-deterministic switching behavior, in agreement with
experimental observations. When the barrier thickness is reduced, the overall
coupling between the magnetic layers across the barrier becomes ferromagnetic,
which suppresses the backhopping effect.

observations $y=x_0+z$. In this paper, we focus on the ""structured denoising
problem"", where the signal $x_0$ possesses a certain structure and $z$ has
independent normally distributed entries with mean zero and variance
$\sigma^2$. We employ a structure-inducing convex function $f(\cdot)$ and solve
$\min_x\{\frac{1}{2}\|y-x\|_2^2+\sigma\lambda f(x)\}$ to estimate $x_0$, for
some $\lambda>0$. Common choices for $f(\cdot)$ include the $\ell_1$ norm for
sparse vectors, the $\ell_1-\ell_2$ norm for block-sparse signals and the
nuclear norm for low-rank matrices. The metric we use to evaluate the
performance of an estimate $x^*$ is the normalized mean-squared-error
$\text{NMSE}(\sigma)=\frac{\mathbb{E}\|x^*-x_0\|_2^2}{\sigma^2}$. We show that
NMSE is maximized as $\sigma\rightarrow 0$ and we find the \emph{exact} worst
case NMSE, which has a simple geometric interpretation: the
mean-squared-distance of a standard normal vector to the $\lambda$-scaled
subdifferential $\lambda\partial f(x_0)$. When $\lambda$ is optimally tuned to
minimize the worst-case NMSE, our results can be related to the constrained
denoising problem $\min_{f(x)\leq f(x_0)}\{\|y-x\|_2\}$. The paper also
connects these results to the generalized LASSO problem, in which, one solves
$\min_{f(x)\leq f(x_0)}\{\|y-Ax\|_2\}$ to estimate $x_0$ from noisy linear
observations $y=Ax_0+z$. We show that certain properties of the LASSO problem
are closely related to the denoising problem. In particular, we characterize
the normalized LASSO cost and show that it exhibits a ""phase transition"" as a
function of number of observations. Our results are significant in two ways.
First, we find a simple formula for the performance of a general convex
estimator. Secondly, we establish a connection between the denoising and linear
inverse problems.

of the sample, while spectral variability is found only in one object. There is
general good agreement between BAT and IBIS spectra, despite a systematic
mismatch of about 22% in normalisation. When fitted with a simple power-law
model, type 1 and type 2 sources appear to have very similar average photon
indices, suggesting that they are powered by the same mechanism. As expected,
we also find that a simple power-law does not always describe the data
sufficiently well, thus indicating a certain degree of spectral complexity,
which can be ascribed to features like a high energy cut-off and/or a
reflection component. Fixing the reflection to be 0, 1 or 2, we find that our
sample covers quite a large range in photon indices as well as cut-off
energies; however, the spread is due only to a small number of objects, while
the majority of the AGN lie within well defined boundaries of photon index

containing ions and electrons with the same temperature is of minor importance
due to strong damping of the wave by hot resonant ions. In this work it will be
shown that the IA wave is susceptible to excitation even in plasmas with hot
ions when both an electromagnetic transverse wave and a background density
gradient are present in the plasma, and in addition the wave is in fact
unstable (i.e., growing) in the case of permeating homogeneous plasmas. The
multi-component fluid theory is used to describe the IA wave susceptibility for
excitation in inhomogeneous plasmas and its coupling with electromagnetic
waves. The growing IA wave in permeating homogeneous plasmas is described by
the kinetic theory. In plasmas with density and temperature gradients the IA
wave is effectively coupled with the electromagnetic waves. In comparison to
ordinary IA wave in homogeneous plasma, the Landau damping of the present wave

model is presented for the Landau damping. In the case of permeating plasmas, a
kinetic mechanism for the current-less IA wave instability is presented, with a
very low threshold for excitation as compared with ordinary
electron-current-driven kinetic instability. Such growing IA waves can
effectively heat plasma in the upper solar atmosphere by a stochastic heating
mechanism presented in the work. The results of this work suggest that the IA
wave role in the heating of the solar atmosphere (chromosphere and corona)
should be reexamined.

$\mathbb{R}^3$. A priori error estimates, taking both the approximation of the
surface and the approximation of surface differential operators into account,
are proven in a discrete energy norm and in $L^2$-norm. This can be seen as an
extension of the formalism and method originally used by Dziuk [14] for
approximating solutions to the Laplace-Beltrami problem, and within this
setting this is the first analysis of a surface finite element method
formulated using higher order surface differential operators. Using a polygonal
approximation $\Gamma_h$ of an implicitly defined surface $\Gamma$ we employ
continuous piecewise quadratic finite elements to approximate solutions to the
biharmonic equation on $\Gamma$. Numerical examples on the sphere and on the

quantitatively analysed. In particular, using detrended fractal analysis we
determine persistent fluctuations and temporal correlations in time series of
agent's activity and statistics of avalanches carrying emotional messages of
agents when Bots favoring positive/negative affects are active. We determine
the impact of Bots and identify parameters that can modulate it. Our analysis
suggests that, by these measures, the emotional Bots induce collective emotion
among interacting agents by suitably altering the fractal characteristics of
the underlying stochastic process.Positive-emotion Bots are slightly more
effective than the negative ones. Moreover, the Bots which are periodically
alternating between positive and negative emotion, can enhance fluctuations in
the system leading to the avalanches of agent's messages that are reminiscent
of self-organized critical states.

from 0.2 dex for RG $\sim$ 6.5 kpc to 0.4 dex for RG $\sim$ 5.5 kpc. Moreover,
we do not find evidence of correlation between iron abundance and distance from
the Galactic plane. We collected similar data available in the literature and
ended up with a sample of 420 Cepheids. Current data suggest that the mean
metallicity and the metallicity dispersion in the four quadrants of the
Galactic disk attain similar values. The first-second quadrants show a more
extended metal-poor tail, while the third-fourth quadrants show a more extended
metal-rich tail, but the bulk of the sample is at solar iron abundance.
Finally, we found a significant difference between the iron abundance of
Cepheids located close to the edge of the inner disk ([Fe/H]$\sim$0.4) and
young stars located either along the Galactic bar or in the nuclear bulge
([Fe/H]$\sim$0). Thus suggesting that the above regions have had different
chemical enrichment histories. The same outcome applies to the metallicity
gradient of the Galactic bulge, since mounting empirical evidence indicates
that the mean metallicity increases when moving from the outer to the inner
bulge regions.

G in the outer parts. There is little variation in the field strength between
arm and interarm regions, such that, in the interarms, the field is < 20
percent weaker than in the arms. There is no indication of variation in
magnetic field as one moves along arm or interarm after correcting for the
radial variation of magnetic field. We also studied the energy densities in
gaseous and ionized phases of the interstellar medium and compared to the
energy density in the magnetic field. The energy density in the magnetic field
was found to be similar to that of the gas within a factor of <2 at sub-kpc

calculated from the MEAM potential to those calculated by other commonly used
reactive potentials for hydrocarbons, i.e., second-generation reactive
empirical bond order (REBO) and reactive force field (ReaxFF). MEAM reproduced
the experimental and/or FP data with accuracy comparable to or better than REBO

ethane, propane, and butane systems with different densities were predicted
reasonably well by MEAM. Although the MEAM formalism has been applied to atomic
systems with predominantly metallic bonding in the past, the current work

gamma-ray bands provide evidence for lepton acceleration up to several TeV and
clues about hadron acceleration to tens of EeV. Synthesising the available
observational constraints on the physical conditions and particle content in
the jets, inner lobes and giant lobes of Centaurus A, we aim to evaluate its
feasibility as an ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray source. We apply several methods
of determining jet power and affirm the consistency of various power estimates
of ~ 1 x 10^43 erg s^-1. Employing scaling relations based on previous results
for 3C 31, we estimate particle number densities in the jets, encompassing
available radio through X-ray observations. Our model is compatible with the
jets ingesting ~ 3 x 10^21 g s^-1 of matter via external entrainment from hot
gas and ~ 7 x 10^22 g s^-1 via internal entrainment from jet-contained stars.
This leads to an imbalance between the internal lobe pressure available from
radiating particles and magnetic field, and our derived external pressure.
Based on knowledge of the external environments of other FR I sources, we
estimate the thermal pressure in the giant lobes as 1.5 x 10^-12 dyn cm^-2,
from which we deduce a lower limit to the temperature of ~ 1.6 x 10^8 K. Using
dynamical and buoyancy arguments, we infer ~ 440-645 Myr and ~ 560 Myr as the
sound-crossing and buoyancy ages of the giant lobes respectively, inconsistent
with their spectral ages. We re-investigate the feasibility of particle
acceleration via stochastic processes in the lobes, placing new constraints on
the energetics and on turbulent input to the lobes. The same 'very hot'
temperatures that allow self-consistency between the entrainment calculations
and the missing pressure also allow stochastic UHECR acceleration models to
work.

A dynamical phase transition may appear at high level density in a many-level

complex and sufficiently large. Here nonlinearities occur. When $W_{ij}$ is
imaginary, two singular (exceptional) points may exist. In the parameter range
between these two points, width bifurcation occurs as function of a certain
external parameter. A unitary representation of the S-matrix allows to
calculate the cross section for a two-level system, including at the
exceptional point (double pole of the S-matrix). The results obtained for the
transition of level repulsion at small (real) $W_{ij}$ to width bifurcation at
large (imaginary) $W_{ij}$ show qualitatively the same features that are
observed experimentally in the transition from Autler-Townes splitting to
electromagnetically induced transparency in optics. Fermi's golden rule holds
only below the dynamical phase transition while it passes into an anti-golden
rule beyond this transition. The results are generic and can be applied to the
response of a complex open quantum system to the action of an external field
(environment). They may be considered as a guideline for engineering and
manipulating quantum systems in such a way that they can be used for

between certain types of algebraic and geometric objects. The basic algebraic
environment we work in is the a semifield of fractions H(x1,...,xn) of the
polynomial semidomain H[x1,...,xn], where H is taken to be an idempotent
semifield, while for the geometric environment we have the space H^n. We show
that taking H to be idempotent makes both H(x1,...,xn) and Hn idempotent which
turn out to satisfy many desired properties that we utilize for our
construction. The fundamental algebraic and geometric objects having
interrelations are called kernels, encapsulating congruences over semifields
and skeletons which serve as the analog for zero-sets of algebraic geometry. As
an analog for the celebrated Nullstellenzats theorem, we develop a
correspondence between skeletons and a family of kernels called polars
originally developed in the theory of lattice-ordered groups. For a special
kind of skeletons, called principal skeletons, we have simplified the
correspondence by restricting our algebraic environment to a certain kernel of
H(x1,...,xn). After establishing the linkage between kernels and skeletons we
proceed to construct a second linkage, this time between a family of skeletons
and what we call ""corner-loci"". Essentially a corner locus is what is called a
tropical variety in the theory of tropical geometry, which is a set of corner
roots of some set of tropical polynomials. A skeleton and a corner-locus define
the exact same subset of H^n in different ways: while a corner locus is defined
by corner roots of tropical polynomials, the skeleton is defined by equating
fractions from H(x1,...,xn) to 1. All the connections presented above form a
path connecting a tropical variety to a certain kind of kernel.

long-term energy constraints. A simple sufficient condition for the existence
of a Nash equilibrium in this game is provided and shown to be verified in a
typical scenario. As the uniqueness and determination of equilibria are
difficult issues in general, especially when the number of players goes large,
we move to two special cases: the single player case which gives us some useful
insights of practical interest and allows one to make connections with the case
of large number of players. The latter case is treated with a mean-field game
approach for which reasonable sufficient conditions for convergence and
uniqueness are provided. Remarkably, this recent approach for large system

that during the pellet evaporation an ELM is triggered, during which the amount
particle loss could be larger (factor ~1.5) than the particle loss during an
ELM which was not induced by pellet. Secondly, a favourable example is shown in
which post-pellet particle losses due to mitigated ELMs are similar to the
non-pellet case, however unfavourable counter-examples also exist.

the majority of the electron population being in the ground state of the

take place from one ground state to that of the next higher ionization stage.
However, the question arises as to whether, in some cases, ionization can also
affect the excited level populations. This would apply particularly to those
cases involving transient events such as impurity influxes in a laboratory
plasma. An analysis of the importance of ionization in populating the excited
levels of ions in plasmas typical of those found in the edge of tokamaks is
undertaken for the C IV and C V ionization stages. The emphasis is on those
energy levels giving rise to transitions of most use for diagnostic purposes.
Carbon is chosen since it is an important contaminant of JET plasmas; it was
the dominant low Z impurity before the installation of the ITER-like wall and
is still present in the plasma after its installation. Direct electron
collisional ionization both from and to excited levels is considered.
Distorted-wave Flexible Atomic Code calculations are performed to generate the
required ionization cross sections, due to a lack of atomic data in the

decomposition in the bulk implies that all correlators are exactly the same for

interpreted in two ways. First, at the fully non-perturbative level of AdS/CFT
at finite N, it means that cluster decomposition does not hold in the bulk.
This may be viewed as a sharp manifestation of the bulk non-locality at finite
N. Second, at the level of the perturbation theory in 1/N, in which case we
expect the bulk cluster decomposition, no measurement of either boundary
operators or bulk field operators can distinguish the different microstates.
The latter interpretation may exclude some versions of the fuzzball conjecture

geophysical signals are discussed: (1) multidecadal natural oscillations (e.g.
the quasi 60-year Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), North Atlantic
Oscillation (NAO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)) need to be taken into
account for properly quantifying anomalous accelerations in tide gauge records

forcing functions prevent a proper evaluation of the solar contribution to the
20th century global surface temperature warming using overloaded linear
regression models during the 1900-2000 period alone; (3) when periodic wavelet
filters, which require that a record is pre-processed with a reflection
methodology, are improperly applied to decompose non-stationary solar and
climatic time series, Gibbs boundary artifacts emerge yielding misleading
physical interpretations. By correcting these errors and using optimized
regression models that reduce multicollinearity artifacts, I found the
following results: (1) the sea level in New York City is not accelerating in an
alarming way, and may increase by about 350 mm from 2000 to 2100 instead of the
previously projected values varying from 1130 mm to 1550 mm estimated using the
methods proposed by Sallenger et al. (2012) and Boon (2012), respectively; (2)
the solar activity increase during the 20th century contributed about 50% of
the 0.8 K global warming observed during the 20th century instead of only 7-10%
(IPCC, 2007; Benestad and Schmidt, 2009; Lean and Rind, 2009). These findings
stress the importance of natural oscillations and of the sun to properly
interpret climatic changes.

credit portfolio performance, with a view to forecasting future performance,
and facilitating strategic decision making. We consider a situation, common in
practice, where accounts with common origination date (typically month) are
aggregated into a single vintage for analysis, and the data for analysis
consists of a time series of a univariate portfolio performance variable (for
example, the proportion of defaulting accounts) for each vintage over
successive time periods since origination. An invaluable management tool for
understanding portfolio behaviour can be obtained by decomposing the data
series nonparametrically into components of exogenous variability (E), maturity
(time since origination; M) and vintage (V), referred to as an EMV model. For
example, identification of a good macroeconomic model is the key to effective
forecasting, particularly in applications such as stress testing, and
identification of this can be facilitated by investigation of the macroeconomic
component of an EMV decomposition. We show that care needs to be taken with
such a decomposition, drawing parallels with the Age-Period-Cohort approach,
common in demography, epidemiology and sociology. We develop a practical
decomposition strategy, and illustrate our approach using data extracted from a

monitoring by 0.3 to 0.4 magnitude units. In seismically active regions, the
optimal choice of master events is straightforward. There are two approaches to
populate the global grid in aseismic areas: the replication of real masters and
synthetic seismograms calculated for seismic arrays of the International
Monitoring System. Synthetic templates depend on the accuracy of shape and
amplitude predictions controlled by focal depth and mechanism, source function,
velocity structure and attenuation along the master/station path. As in Part I,
we test three focal mechanisms (explosion, thrust fault, and actual Harvard CMT
solution for one of the April 11, 2012 Sumatera aftershocks) and two velocity
structures (ak135 and CRUST 2.0). Sixteen synthetic master events were
distributed over a 1ox1o grid. We built five cross correlation standard event
lists (XSEL) and compared detections and events with those built using the real
and grand master events as well as with the Reviewed Event Bulletin of the
International Data Centre. The XSELs built using the source of explosion and
ak135 and the reverse fault with isotropic radiation pattern demonstrate the
performance similar to that of the real and grand masters. Therefore, it is
possible to cover all aseismic areas with synthetic masters without significant
loss in seismic monitoring capabilities based on cross correlation.

law is actually an inner product space. For finite dimensional normed vector
spaces over R, we formulate an approximate version of this theorem: if a space
approximately satisfies the parallelogram law, then it has a near isometry with
Euclidean space. In other words, a small von Neumann Jordan constant E + 1 for
X yields a small Banach-Mazur distance with R^n, d(X, R^n) < 1 + B_n E +
O(E^2). Finally, we examine how this estimate worsens as the dimension, n, of X
increases, with the conclusion that B_n grows quadratically with n.

similarities in pairs of simulated human-generated patterns. An example for a
pattern is a time-series representing a heart rate during a specific
time-range, wherein the time-series is a sequence of data points that represent
the changes in the heart rate values. A bio-medical simulator system was
developed to acquire a collection of 7,871 price patterns of financial
instruments. The financial instruments traded in real-time on three American
stock exchanges, NASDAQ, NYSE, and AMEX, simulate bio-medical measurements. The
system simulates a human in which each price pattern represents one bio-medical
sensor. Data provided during trading hours from the stock exchanges allowed
real-time classification. Classification is based on new machine learning
techniques: self-labeling, which allows the application of supervised learning
methods on unlabeled time-series and similarity ranking, which applied on a
decision tree learning algorithm to classify time-series regardless of type and
quantity.

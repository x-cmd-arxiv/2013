  overlapping subjects in association mapping","1/17/14: Minor text changes",,,,"q-bio.QM stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies is increasingly popular and
many meta-analytic methods have been recently proposed. A majority of
meta-analytic methods combine information from multiple studies by assuming
that studies are independent since individuals collected in one study are
unlikely to be collected again by another study. However, it has become
increasingly common to utilize the same control individuals among multiple
studies to reduce genotyping or sequencing cost. This causes those studies that
share the same individuals to be dependent, and spurious associations may arise
if overlapping subjects are not taken into account in a meta-analysis. In this
paper, we propose a general framework for meta-analyzing dependent studies with
overlapping subjects. Given dependent studies, our approach ""decouples"" the
studies into independent studies such that meta-analysis methods assuming
independent studies can be applied. This enables many meta-analysis methods,
such as the random effects model, to account for overlapping subjects. Another
advantage is that one can continue to use preferred software in the analysis
pipeline which may not support overlapping subjects. Using simulations and the
Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium data, we show that our decoupling
approach allows both the fixed and the random effects models to account for
overlapping subjects while retaining desirable false positive rate and power.

complicated the structure in a string is. Sophistication is defined as the
minimal complexity of a computable function that defines a two-part description
for the string that is shortest within some precision; the second can be
defined as the minimal computation time of a program that is shortest within
some precision. We show that the Busy Beaver function of the sophistication of
a string exceeds its logical depth with logarithmically bigger precision, and
that logical depth exceeds the Busy Beaver function of sophistication with
logarithmically bigger precision. We also show that this is not true if the
precision is only increased by a constant (when the notions are defined with
plain Kolmogorov complexity). Finally we show that sophistication is unstable
in its precision: constant variations can change its value by a linear term in
the length of the string.

at sub-sonic speeds. Although the front eventually comes to a halt (in the

capable of converting the rest of the star. However, in the process, we also
find that neutrino cooling of the interface causes it to wrinkle, laying a

about the origins of those fluctuations. Although the Planck collaboration has
recently obtained tight constraints on primordial non-gaussianity from cosmic
microwave background measurements, it is still worthwhile to mine upcoming data
sets in effort to place independent or competitive limits. The ionized bubbles
that formed at redshift z~6-20 during the Epoch of Reionization are seeded by
primordial overdensities, and so the statistics of the ionization field at high
redshift are related to the statistics of the primordial field. Here we model
the effect of primordial non-gaussianity on the reionization field. The epoch
and duration of reionization are affected as are the sizes of the ionized
bubbles, but these changes are degenerate with variations in the properties of
the ionizing sources and the surrounding intergalactic medium. A more promising
signature is the power spectrum of the spatial fluctuations in the ionization
field, which may be probed by upcoming 21 cm surveys. This has the expected
1/k^2 dependence on large scales, characteristic of a biased tracer of the
matter field. We project how well upcoming 21 cm observations will be able to
disentangle this signal from foreground contamination. Although foreground
cleaning inevitably removes the large-scale modes most impacted by primordial
non-gaussianity, we find that primordial non-gaussianity can be separated from
foreground contamination for a narrow range of length scales. In principle,
futuristic redshifted 21 cm surveys may allow constraints competitive with
Planck.

restriction, invariance under inner automorphisms requires the inner
fluctuations of the Dirac operator to contain a quadratic piece expressed in

to a Pati-Salam SU(2)_{R}x SU(2)_{L}x SU(4) type model which unifies leptons

with a closed Fermi surface in a quantizing magnetic field and at helium
temperatures has been studied in the geometry where the temperature gradient
and the magnetic field are perpendicular to the material lasyers. The
calculations are carried out in the constant relaxation time approximation. In
weak magnetic fields,the layered structure effects are shown to manifest
themselves in a phase retardation of power factor oscillations,increase of
their relativeb contribution, and certain reduction of the power factor in
whole.In highmagnetic fields,there exists an optimal range,where the power
factor reaches its maximum,with the corresponding value calculated for the
chosen parameters of the problem in the effective mass approximation being by
12%higher than that for real layered crystals.Despite low temperatures,the
power factor maximum obtained with those parameters in a magnetic field of 1T
has a value characteristic of cuprate thermoelectric materials at 1000K. For
this phenomenon to take place, it is necessary that the ratio between the free
path of charge carriers and interlayer distance should be equal to or larger
than 30000. However,in ultraquantum magnetic fields, the power factor
drastically decreases following the dependence P propto T^-3B^-6.The main
reason for this reduction is a squeeze of the Fermi surface along the magnetic
field in the ultraquantum limit owing the condensation of charge carriers on
the bottom of a single filled Landau subband.

Greenwich, from May of 1874 through 1976 indicate a curious history for the
penumbral areas of the smaller sunspot groups. On average, the ratio of
penumbral area to umbral area in a sunspot group increases from 5 to 6 as the
total sunspot group area increases from 100 to 2000 microHem (a microHem is a
millionth the area of a solar hemisphere). This relationship does not vary
substantially with sunspot group latitude or with the phase of the sunspot
cycle. However, for the sunspot groups with total areas <100 microHem, this
ratio changes dramatically and systematically through this historical record.
The ratio for these smallest sunspots is near 5.5 from 1874 to 1900. After a
rapid rise to more than 7 in 1905 it drops smoothly to less than 3 by 1930 and
then rises smoothly back to more than 7 in 1961. It then returns to near 5.5
from 1965 to 1976. The smooth variation from 1905 to 1961 shows no indication
of any step-like changes that might be attributed to changes in equipment or
personnel. The overall level of solar activity was increasing monotonically
during this time period when the penumbra-to-umbra area ratio dropped to less
than half its peak value and then returned. If this history can be confirmed by
other observations (e.g., Mt. Wilson or Kodaikanal) it may impact our
understanding of penumbra formation, our dynamo models, and our estimates of
historical changes in the solar irradiance.

dominates the other input parameters, the complexity is soft-linear in $n$ and
$L$.
  Our result on approximate multipoint evaluation has some interesting
consequences on the bit complexity of further approximation algorithms which
all use polynomial evaluation as a key subroutine. Of these applications, we
discuss in detail an algorithm for polynomial interpolation and for computing a
Taylor shift of a polynomial. Furthermore, our result can be used to derive
improved complexity bounds for algorithms to refine isolating intervals for the
real roots of a polynomial. For all of the latter algorithms, we derive
near-optimal running times.

imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes during high states in the optical and
GeV bands, to search for very high energy (VHE, defined as E >= 0.1 TeV)
emission. VHE \gamma-rays were detected with a statistical significance of 9.2
standard deviations in 15.8 hours of H.E.S.S. data taken during March and April
2009. A VHE integral flux of I(0.15 TeV < E < 1.0 TeV) = (1.0 +- 0.2 (stat) +-
0.2 (sys) x 10^{-11} cm^{-2}s^{-1} is measured. The best-fit power law to the
VHE data has a photon index of \Gamma=5.4 +- 0.7 (stat) +- 0.3 (sys). The GeV
and optical light curves show pronounced variability during the period of
H.E.S.S. observations. However, there is insufficient evidence to claim
statistically significant variability in the VHE data. Because of its
relatively high redshift, the VHE flux from PKS 1510-089 should suffer
considerable attenuation in the intergalactic space due to the extragalactic
background light (EBL). Hence, the measured \gamma-ray spectrum is used to
derive upper limits on the opacity due to EBL, which are found to be comparable
with the previously derived limits from relatively-nearby BL Lac objects.
Unlike typical VHE-detected blazars where the broadband spectrum is dominated
by non-thermal radiation at all wavelengths, the quasar PKS 1510-089 has a
bright thermal component in the optical to UV frequency band. Among all VHE
detected blazars, PKS 1510-089 has the most luminous broad line region (BLR).
The detection of VHE emission from this quasar indicates a low level of
\gamma-\gamma absorption on the internal optical to UV photon field.

questions by deriving Schlinker and Amiet's theory in a simple way and by
comparing it to the new formulation, using model blade elements representative
of a wind turbine, a cooling fan and an aircraft propeller. The correct form of
Schlinker and Amiet's theory (1981) is identified. It is valid at high enough

rotational frequency much smaller than the angular frequency of the noise

streaming in a wireless network formed by several users and helpers. A feature
of such networks is that any user is typically in the range of multiple
helpers. Hence, in order to cope with user-helper association, load balancing
and inter-cell interference, an efficient streaming policy should allow the
users to dynamically select the helper node to download from, and determine
adaptively the video quality level of the download. In order to obtain a
tractable formulation, we follow a ""divide and conquer"" approach: i) Assuming
that each video packet (chunk) is delivered within its playback delay (""smooth
streaming regime""), the problem is formulated as a network utility maximization
(NUM), subject to queue stability, where the network utility function is a
concave and componentwise non-decreasing function of the users' video quality
measure. ii) We solve the NUM problem by using a Lyapunov Drift Plus Penalty
approach, obtaining a scheme that naturally decomposes into two sub-policies
referred to as ""congestion control"" (adaptive video quality and helper station
selection) and ""transmission scheduling"" (dynamic allocation of the helper-user
physical layer transmission rates).Our solution is provably optimal with
respect to the proposed NUM problem, in a strong per-sample path sense. iii)
Finally, we propose a method to adaptively estimate the maximum queuing delays,
such that each user can calculate its pre-buffering and re-buffering time in
order to cope with the fluctuations of the queuing delays. Through simulations,
we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm under realistic
assumptions of a network with densely deployed helper nodes, and demonstrate
the per-sample path optimality of the proposed solution by considering a
non-stationary non-ergodic scenario with user mobility, VBR video coding.

possible to approximately recover the decomposition if the tensor is known up
to a sufficiently small (inverse polynomial) error.
  Kruskal's theorem has found many applications in proving the identifiability
of parameters for various latent variable models and mixture models such as
Hidden Markov models, topic models etc. Our robust version immediately implies
identifiability using only polynomially many samples in many of these settings.
This polynomial identifiability is an essential first step towards efficient
learning algorithms for these models.
  Recently, algorithms based on tensor decompositions have been used to
estimate the parameters of various hidden variable models efficiently in
special cases as long as they satisfy certain ""non-degeneracy"" properties. Our
methods give a way to go beyond this non-degeneracy barrier, and establish
polynomial identifiability of the parameters under much milder conditions.
Given the importance of Kruskal's theorem in the tensor literature, we expect
that this robust version will have several applications beyond the settings we
explore in this work.

in the mammograms. This technique detects the edges accurately than the ones
obtained by the conventional Sobel method. Generally, Sobel method detects the
edges of the regions/objects in an image using the Fudge factor that assumes
its value as 0.5, by default. In this proposed technique, the Fudge factor is
suitably replaced with Hurst Co-efficient, which is computed as the difference
of Fractal dimension and the topological dimension of a given input image.
These two dimensions are image-dependent, and hence the respective Hurst
co-efficient too varies with respect to images. Hence, the image-dependent
Hurst co-efficient based Sobel method is proved to produce better results than
the Fudge factor based Sobel method. The results of the proposed method
substantiate the merit of the proposed technique.

ML/min-distance one as a special case, are studied for arbitrary
constellations, bit mapping and coding. Earlier results obtained for the AWGN
channel are extended to a wide class of noise densities, including unimodal and
spherically-invariant noise. Under these broad conditions, symbol and bit error
rates are shown to be convex functions of the SNR in the high-SNR regime with
an explicitly-determined threshold, which depends only on the constellation
dimensionality and minimum distance, thus enabling an application of the
powerful tools of convex optimization to such digital communication systems in
a rigorous way. It is the decreasing nature of the noise power density around
the decision region boundaries that insures the convexity of symbol error rates
in the general case. The known high/low SNR bounds of the convexity/concavity
regions are tightened and no further improvement is shown to be possible in
general. The high SNR bound fits closely into the channel coding theorem: all
codes, including capacity-achieving ones, whose decision regions include the
hardened noise spheres (from the noise sphere hardening argument in the channel
coding theorem) satisfies this high SNR requirement and thus has convex error
rates in both SNR and noise power. We conjecture that all capacity-achieving
codes have convex error rates. Convexity properties in signal amplitude and
noise power are also investigated. Some applications of the results are
discussed. In particular, it is shown that fading is convexity-preserving and
is never good in low dimensions under spherically-invariant noise, which may
also include any linear diversity combining.

with the X-ray position of the pulsar. The morphology of the object and the
orientation of its major axis are in a good agreement with those observed for
the pulsar torus-like nebula in the mid-infrared, optical, and X-rays. This
suggests that it is the near-infrared counterpart of the nebula. The measured
fluxes compiled with the data in other ranges show a complicated unabsorbed
power law spectrum of the torus-like nebula with several steep breaks between
the near-infrared and mid-infrared, the optical and X-rays, and possibly in the
mid-infrared. This implies a multiple relativistic particle population
responsible for the synchrotron emission of the nebula in different spectral
ranges. We have not resolved the pulsar counterpart from its nebula and place
only upper limits on its brightness, H >= 23.9$ and Ks >= 22.7. Based on that,

theorem, such metrics allow for the proper modeling of the accretion flows
around candidate black holes and the radiation emitted from them. In many of
these models, the location of the inner edge of the accretion disk is of
special importance. This inner edge is often taken to coincide with the
innermost stable circular orbit, which can serve as a direct probe of the spin
and the deviation from the Kerr metric. In certain cases, however, an innermost
stable circular orbit does not exist, and the inner edge of an accretion disk
is instead determined by an instability against small perturbations in the
direction vertical to the disk. In this paper, I analyze the properties of
accretion disks in the Kerr-like metric proposed by Johannsen and Psaltis

fitting parameterized models to RHESSI X-ray spectra, considering only
statistical sources of error. Three of the four methods are based on estimating
the scale-size of the minimum in a hypersurface formed by the weighted sum of
the squares of the differences between the model fit and the data as a function
of the fit parameters, and are implemented as commonly practiced. The fourth
method uses Bayesian data analysis and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
techniques to calculate an uncertainty estimate. Two flare spectra are modeled:
one from the GOES X1.3 class flare of 19 January 2005, and the other from the
X4.8 flare of 23 July 2002. The four methods give approximately the same
uncertainty estimates for the 19 January 2005 spectral fit parameters, but lead
to very different uncertainty estimates for the 23 July 2002 spectral fit. This
is because each method implements different analyses of the hypersurface,
yielding method-dependent results that differ greatly depending on the shape of
the hypersurface. For the 23 July 2002 flare data, there is a 95% probability
that the low energy cutoff lies below approximately 40 keV, and a 68%
probability that it lies in the range 7-36 keV. The low-energy cutoff for the
19 January 2005 flare is more tightly constrained to 107+/-4 keV (68%
probability). Using the Bayesian/MCMC approach, we also estimate for the first
time probability density functions (PDFs) for the total number of flare
accelerated electrons and the energy they carry. For the 23 July 2002 event,
these PDFs are asymmetric with long tails orders of magnitude higher than the
most probable value, caused by the poorly constrained value of the low-energy
cutoff. For the 19 January 2005 flare spectrum, the PDFs for the total number
of flare accelerated electrons and their energy are much more symmetric and
narrow.

gravitationally bound astronomical $N$-body system in the weak field and
slow-motion approximation of the general theory of relativity. Celestial bodies
are described using an arbitrary energy-momentum tensor and assumed to possess
any number of internal multipole moments. The solution of the gravitational
field equations in any reference frame is presented as a sum of three terms: i)
the inertial flat spacetime in that frame, ii) unperturbed solutions for each
body in the system that is covariantly transformed to the coordinates of this
frame, and iii) the gravitational interaction term. We use the harmonic gauge
conditions that allow reconstruction of a significant part of the structure of
the post-Galilean coordinate transformation functions relating global
coordinates of the inertial reference frame to the local coordinates of the
non-inertial frame associated with a particular body. The remaining parts of
these functions are determined from dynamical conditions, obtained by
constructing the relativistic proper reference frame associated with a
particular body. In this frame, the effect of external forces acting on the
body is balanced by the fictitious frame-reaction force that is needed to keep
the body at rest with respect to the frame, conserving its relativistic
three-momentum. The resulting post-Galilean coordinate transformations have an
approximate group structure that extends the Poincar'e group of global
transformations to the case of accelerating observers in a gravitational field
of $N$-body system. We present and discuss the structure of the metric tensors
corresponding to the reference frames involved, the rules for transforming
relativistic gravitational potentials, the coordinate transformations between
frames and the resulting relativistic equations of motion.

payoffs depend on both a player's individual decision and also the decisions of
her neighbors. Such games have been used to model issues including the
formation of opinions and the adoption of technology. A basic question that has
remained largely open in this area is to consider games where the strategies
available to the players come from a fixed, discrete set, and where players may
have different intrinsic preferences among the possible strategies. It is
natural to model the tension among these different preferences by positing a
distance function on the strategy set that determines a notion of ""similarity""
among strategies; a player's payoff is determined by the distance from her
chosen strategy to her preferred strategy and to the strategies chosen by her
network neighbors. Even when there are only two strategies available, this
framework already leads to natural open questions about a version of the
classical Battle of the Sexes problem played on a graph.
  We develop a set of techniques for analyzing this class of games, which we
refer to as discrete preference games. We parametrize the games by the relative
extent to which a player takes into account the effect of her preferred
strategy and the effect of her neighbors' strategies, allowing us to
interpolate between network coordination games and unilateral decision-making.
When these two effects are balanced, we show that the price of stability is
equal to 1 for any discrete preference game in which the distance function on
the strategies is a tree metric; as a special case, this includes the Battle of
the Sexes on a graph. We also show that trees form the maximal family of
metrics for which the price of stability is 1, and produce a collection of
metrics on which the price of stability converges to a tight bound of 2.

aims to recover a spectrally sparse signal from a small random subset of its
$n$ time domain samples. The signal of interest is assumed to be a
superposition of $r$ multi-dimensional complex sinusoids, while the underlying
frequencies can assume any \emph{continuous} values in the normalized frequency
domain. Conventional compressed sensing paradigms suffer from the basis
mismatch issue when imposing a discrete dictionary on the Fourier
representation. To address this issue, we develop a novel algorithm, called
\emph{Enhanced Matrix Completion (EMaC)}, based on structured matrix completion
that does not require prior knowledge of the model order. The algorithm starts
by arranging the data into a low-rank enhanced form exhibiting multi-fold
Hankel structure, and then attempts recovery via nuclear norm minimization.
Under mild incoherence conditions, EMaC allows perfect recovery as soon as the
number of samples exceeds the order of $r\log^{4}n$, and is stable against
bounded noise. Even if a constant portion of samples are corrupted with
arbitrary magnitude, EMaC still allows exact recovery, provided that the sample
complexity exceeds the order of $r^{2}\log^{3}n$. Along the way, our results
demonstrate the power of convex relaxation in completing a low-rank multi-fold
Hankel or Toeplitz matrix from minimal observed entries. The performance of our
algorithm and its applicability to super resolution are further validated by
numerical experiments.

symbols from the corrupted codeword, where $N$ is the block-length of the code.
  Expander codes, introduced by Sipser and Spielman, are formed from an

symbol in $\Sigma$. A string in $\Sigma^{E}$ will be a codeword if for each

noiseless setting, then the corresponding expander code has an efficient
local-correction algorithm in the noisy setting. Instantiating our construction

random-walk-based LOCAL algorithms whose running times depend only on the size
of the output cluster, rather than the entire graph. All previously known such
algorithms guarantee an output conductance of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\phi(A)})$ when
the target set $A$ has conductance $\phi(A)\in[0,1]$. In this paper, we improve
it to $$\tilde{O}\bigg( \min\Big\{\sqrt{\phi(A)},
\frac{\phi(A)}{\sqrt{\mathsf{Conn}(A)}} \Big\} \bigg)\enspace, $$ where the
internal connectivity parameter $\mathsf{Conn}(A) \in [0,1]$ is defined as the
reciprocal of the mixing time of the random walk over the induced subgraph on
$A$.
  For instance, using $\mathsf{Conn}(A) = \Omega(\lambda(A) / \log n)$ where
$\lambda$ is the second eigenvalue of the Laplacian of the induced subgraph on
$A$, our conductance guarantee can be as good as
$\tilde{O}(\phi(A)/\sqrt{\lambda(A)})$. This builds an interesting connection
to the recent advance of the so-called improved Cheeger's Inequality [KKL+13],
which says that global spectral algorithms can provide a conductance guarantee
of $O(\phi_{\mathsf{opt}}/\sqrt{\lambda_3})$ instead of
$O(\sqrt{\phi_{\mathsf{opt}}})$.
  In addition, we provide theoretical guarantee on the clustering accuracy (in
terms of precision and recall) of the output set. We also prove that our
analysis is tight, and perform empirical evaluation to support our theory on
both synthetic and real data.
  It is worth noting that, our analysis outperforms prior work when the cluster
is well-connected. In fact, the better it is well-connected inside, the more
significant improvement (both in terms of conductance and accuracy) we can
obtain. Our results shed light on why in practice some random-walk-based
algorithms perform better than its previous theory, and help guide future
research about local clustering.

$k$-fault-tolerant $(1+\eps)$-spanner with optimal degree $O(k)$ within optimal
time $O(n \log n + k n)$.
  We then strengthen this result to provide near-optimal (up to a factor of
$\log k$) guarantees on the diameter and weight of our spanners, namely,
diameter $O(\log n)$ and weight $O(k^2 + k \log n) \cdot \omega(MST)$, while
preserving the optimal guarantees on the degree $O(k)$ and the running time
$O(n \log n + k n)$.
  Our result settles several fundamental open questions in this area,
culminating a long line of research that started with the STOC'95 paper of Arya
et al.\ and the STOC'98 paper of Levcopoulos et al.
  On the way to this result we develop a new technique for constructing
spanners in doubling metrics. Our spanner construction is based on a novel
\emph{hierarchical cover} of the metric, whereas most previous constructions of
spanners for doubling and Euclidean metrics (such as the net-tree spanner) are
based on \emph{hierarchical partitions} of the metric. We demonstrate the power
of hierarchical covers in the context of geometric spanners by improving the
state-of-the-art results in this area.

$h^0$ or the heavy CP-even Higgs $H^0$. Imposing both theoretical and
experimental constraints, we analyze the surviving parameter regions in $m_H$
($m_h$), $m_A$, $m_{H^\pm}$, $\tan\beta$ and $\sin(\beta - \alpha)$. We further
identify the regions that could accommodate a 126 GeV Higgs with cross sections
consistent with the observed Higgs signal. We find that in the $h^0$-126 case,
we are restricted to narrow regions of $\sin(\beta-\alpha) \approx \pm 1$ with
$\tan\beta$ up to 4, or an extended region with $0.55 < \sin(\beta-\alpha) <
0.9$ and $1.5 < \tan\beta < 4$. The values of $m_H$, $m_A$ and $m_{H^\pm}$,
however, are relatively unconstrained. In the $H^0$-126 case, we are restricted
to a narrow region of $\sin(\beta-\alpha) \sim 0$ with $\tan\beta$ up to about
8, or an extended region of $\sin(\beta-\alpha) $ between $-0.8$ to $-0.05$,
with $\tan\beta$ extended to 30 or higher. $m_A$ and $m_{H^\pm}$ are nearly
degenerate due to $\Delta\rho$ constraints. Imposing flavor constraints shrinks
the surviving parameter space significantly for the $H^0$-126 case, limiting
$\tan\beta \lesssim 10$, but has little effect in the $h^0$-126 case. We also
investigate the correlation between $\gamma\gamma$, $VV$ and $bb/\tau\tau$

correlated with $\gamma\gamma:VV \sim 1$ for the normalized cross sections.

the back of the shock also at the radio frequencies below 600 MHz. The spectral
curvature in the same relic also increases in the downstream area. The data is

matter must be controlled by a critical fixed point, we argue that the form of
the single-particle propagator can be deduced simply by imposing scale
invariance. As a consequence, the unparticle picture proposed by
Georgi\cite{georgi} is the natural candidate to describe such dynamics.
Unparticle stuff is scale-invariant matter with no particular mass. Scale
invariance dictates that the propagator has an algebraic form which can admit
zeros and hence is a candidate to explain the ubiquitous pseudogap state of the
cuprates. The non-perturbative electronic state formed out of unparticles we
refer to as an un-Fermi liquid. We show that the underlying action of the
continuous mass formulation of unparticles can be recast exactly as an action
in anti de Sitter space. We find that this mapping fixes the scaling dimension
of the unparticle to be $d_U=d/2+\sqrt{d^2+4}/2$ and ensures that the
corresponding propagator has zeros with $d$ the spacetime dimension of the
unparticle field. Should $d=2+1$, unparticles acquire the non-trivial phase
$2\pi d_U$ upon interchange. Because $d_U$ is non-integer and in general not
half-integer, clockwise and counterclockwise interchange of unparticles do not
lead to the same phase and time reversal symmetry is broken spontaneously as
reported in numerous experiments in the pseudogap phase of the cuprates. The
possible relevance of this mechanism to such experiments is discussed. We then
formulate the analogous BCS gap using unparticles and find that in contrast to
the Fermi liquid case, the transition temperature increases as the attractive
interaction strength decreases, indicating that unparticles are highly
susceptible to a superconducting instability.

benefit depends on the mass of the resonance.

and dark energy affect the visible sector only through the gravitational field
they produce, they are inseparable without a model for dark energy: galaxy bias
cannot be measured and therefore the distribution of dark matter determined;
the peculiar velocity of dark matter can be identified with that of the
galaxies only when the equivalence principle holds. Given these limitations, we
show how one can nonetheless build tests for classes of dark energy models
which depend on making measurements at multiple scales at a particular
redshift. They are null tests on the model-independent observables, do not
require modeling evolution in time and do not require any parametrization of
the free functions of these models, such as the sound speed. We show how one
can rule out or constrain the whole class of the most-general scalar-tensor

it has been shown that breaking Lorentz invariance provides Lagrangians that
can drive the current acceleration of the universe without experiencing large

model of this type, called ThetaCDM, and study its cosmological implications in
detail. At the background level, this model cannot be distinguished from
LambdaCDM. The differences appear at the level of perturbations. We show that
in ThetaCDM, the spectrum of CMB anisotropies and matter fluctuations may be
affected by a rescaling of the gravitational constant in the Poisson equation,
by the presence of extra contributions to the anisotropic stress, and finally
by the existence of extra clustering degrees of freedom. To explore these
modifications accurately, we modify the Boltzmann code CLASS. We then use the
parameter inference code Monte Python to confront ThetaCDM with data from
WMAP-7, SPT and WiggleZ. We obtain strong bounds on the parameters accounting

to avoid cancelling too much angular momentum through shocks at closest

formation of a disc within 0.3 pc from the black hole and a larger, misaligned

of the U-duality Lie algebra of maximal supergravity in D dimensions, for D
between 3 and 7. The level decomposition with respect to the U-duality Lie
algebra gives exactly the tensor hierarchy of representations that arises in
gauge deformations of the theory described by an embedding tensor, for all
positive levels p. We prove that these representations are always contained in
those coming from the associated Borcherds-Kac-Moody superalgebra, and we
explain why some of the latter representations are not included in the tensor
hierarchy. The most remarkable feature of our Lie superalgebra is that it does
not admit a triangular decomposition like a (Borcherds-)Kac-Moody
(super)algebra. Instead the Hodge duality relations between level p and D-2-p
extend to negative p, relating the representations at the first two negative
levels to the supersymmetry and closure constraints of the embedding tensor.

In a 2D strongly localized system a temperature-induced scaling-nonscaling

Minimization (CFR), a popular regret minimization algorithm for extensive-form

Computer Poker Competition (ACPC). In this paper, we provide the first set of
theoretical properties for regret minimization algorithms in non-zero-sum games
by proving that solutions eliminate iterative strict domination. We formally
define \emph{dominated actions} in extensive-form games, show that CFR avoids
iteratively strictly dominated actions and strategies, and demonstrate that
removing iteratively dominated actions is enough to win a mock tournament in a
small poker game. In addition, for two-player non-zero-sum games, we bound the
worst case performance and show that in practice, regret minimization can yield
strategies very close to equilibrium. Our theoretical advancements lead us to a
new modification of CFR for games with more than two players that is more

possible. Furthermore, we present a new three-player Texas Hold'em poker agent

Supersaturation of the droplets leads to rapid 1D growth on the truncating

Surface diffusion is suppressed and the excess Si flux occurs through the
droplet bulk which, together with the Si-rich interface and contact line,
lowers the nucleation barrier on the main facet. The ensuing step flow is
modified by Au diffusion away from the step edges. Our study highlights key

  information processing","Ph.D. Thesis; (v2) removed legacy \newpage commands",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A promising platform for quantum information processing is that of silicon
impurities, where the quantum states are manipulated by magnetic resonance.
Such systems, in abstraction, can be considered as a nucleus of arbitrary spin
coupled to an electron of spin one-half via an isotropic hyperfine interaction.
We therefore refer to them as ""nuclear-electronic spin systems"". The
traditional example, being subject to intensive experimental studies, is that
of phosphorus doped silicon (Si:P) which couples a spin one-half electron to a
nucleus of the same spin, with a hyperfine strength of 117.5 MHz. More
recently, bismuth doped silicon (Si:Bi) has been suggested as an alternative
instantiation of nuclear-electronic spin systems, differing from Si:P by its
larger nuclear spin and hyperfine strength of 9/2 and 1.4754 GHz respectively.
The aim of this thesis has been to develop a model that is capable of
predicting the magnetic resonance properties of nuclear-electronic spin
systems. The theoretical predictions of this model have been tested against
experimental data collected on Si:Bi at 4.044 GHz, and have proven quite
successful. Furthermore, the larger nuclear spin and hyperfine strength of
Si:Bi, compared with that of Si:P, are predicted to offer advantages for
quantum information processing. Most notable amongst these is that magnetic
field-dependent two-dimensional decoherence free subspaces, called optimal
working points, have been identified to exist in Si:Bi, but not Si:P.

the noiseless case, if the condition number of $D$ is bounded and the
measurement number $n\geq \Omega(s\log(p))$ where $s$ is the sparsity number,
then the true solution can be recovered with high probability; and 2) in the
noisy case, if the condition number of $D$ is bounded and the measurement
increases faster than $s\log(p)$, that is, $s\log(p)=o(n)$, the estimate error
converges to zero with probability 1 when $p$ and $s$ go to infinity. Our
results are consistent with those for the special case $D=\bold{I}_{p\times p}$

$D$ plays a critical role in our analysis. We consider the condition numbers in
two cases including the fused LASSO and the random graph: the condition number
in the fused LASSO case is bounded by a constant, while the condition number in
the random graph case is bounded with high probability if $m\over p$ (i.e.,

suffered multiple active galactic nucleus outbursts, blowing bubbles into the
surrounding hot gas, which have resulted in the uplift of cool ionised gas into
the surrounding hot intragroup medium. High velocities, indicative of an
outflow, are observed close to the nucleus and coincident with the radio jet.
Thin dusty filaments accompany the uplifted, ionised gas. No extended star
formation is observed, however, a young cluster is detected just north of the
nucleus. The direction of rise of the bubbles has changed between outbursts.
This directional change is likely due to sloshing motions of the intragroup

identified with fundamental imaginary correlations that characterize the
relations between physical properties in terms of their transformation
dynamics. Non-commutativity thus originates from a definition of relations
between physical properties that replaces the assumption of joint reality with
a complex-valued probability reflecting the dynamical response of the system to
external forces, e.g. in measurement interactions.

this scenario for supermassive black holes using two samples of active galactic
nuclei distinguished by the presence (radio-strong) and absence (radio-weak) of
well-collimated, relativistic jets. Each is centered on a narrow range of black
hole mass but spans a very broad range of Eddington ratios, effectively
simulating, in a statistical manner, the behavior of a single black hole
evolving across a wide spread in accretion states. Unlike the relationship
between the radio and optical luminosity, which shows an abruptly break between
high- and low-luminosity sources at an Eddington ratio of ~1, the radio
emission-a measure of the jet power-varies continuously with the hard X-ray
(2-10 keV) luminosity, roughly as L_R \propto L_X^(0.6-0.75). This relation,
which holds for both radio-weak and radio-strong active galaxies, is similar to
the one seen in X-ray binaries. Jet/outflow formation appears to be closely
linked to the conditions that give rise to the hot, optically thin coronal
emission associated with accretion flows, both in the regime of low and high

a typical scale length (rs) and density (rho_0) of the halo, and a core radius

Ec parameterizes the phase transition due to the underlying particle physics
model, it is independent on the details of galaxy and/or structure formation

only two free parameters. Through the results we agree with previous ones

good that confers its benefits not only to its buyers, but also to other
individuals around them. For example, a snow-blower is potentially useful not
only to the household that buys it, but also to others on the same street.
Given that the seller is constrained to selling such a (locally) public good
via individual private sales, how should he set his prices given the
distribution of values held by the agents?
  We study this problem as a two-stage game. In the first stage, the seller
chooses and announces a price for the product. In the second stage, the agents
(each having a private value for the good) decide simultaneously whether or not
they will buy the product. In the resulting game, which can exhibit a
multiplicity of equilibria, agents must strategize about whether they will
themselves purchase the good to receive its benefits.
  In the case of a fully public good (where all agents benefit whenever any
agent purchases), we describe a pricing mechanism that is approximately
revenue-optimal (up to a constant factor) when values are drawn from a regular
distribution. We then study settings in which the good is only ""locally""
public: agents are arranged in a network and share benefits only with their
neighbors. We describe a pricing method that approximately maximizes revenue,
in the worst case over equilibria of agent behavior, for any $d$-regular
network. Finally, we show that approximately optimal prices can be found for
general networks in the special case that private values are drawn from a
uniform distribution. We also discuss some barriers to extending these results
to general networks and regular distributions.

distribution of a response variable, and as such it permits a much more
accurate portrayal of the relationship between the response variable and
observed covariates than methods such as Least-squares or Least Absolute
Deviations regression. It can be expressed as a linear program, and, with
appropriate preprocessing, interior-point methods can be used to find a
solution for moderately large problems. Dealing with very large problems,
\emph(e.g.), involving data up to and beyond the terabyte regime, remains a
challenge. Here, we present a randomized algorithm that runs in nearly linear
time in the size of the input and that, with constant probability, computes a
$(1+\epsilon)$ approximate solution to an arbitrary quantile regression
problem. As a key step, our algorithm computes a low-distortion
subspace-preserving embedding with respect to the loss function of quantile
regression. Our empirical evaluation illustrates that our algorithm is
competitive with the best previous work on small to medium-sized problems, and
that in addition it can be implemented in MapReduce-like environments and
applied to terabyte-sized problems.

performance of the complex systems having long-range interactions. Since the
covariance of average velocity in double time interval and available force
equals zero, it is possible to calculate the conditional probability
distribution function (CPDF) within the systems. It is found that the
asymmetric CPDF of the velocity between two adjacent time intervals can be
derived from the symmetrical CPDF between the available force and the double
time interval velocity. Two typical currency exchange databases, i.e., EUR/USD
and GBP/USD, which collect the minutely opening exchange prices from 1 January
1999 to 31 December 2011, are adopted as examples. It is found that the
analytical CPDF needs only six parameters for an arbitrary system. By
calculating the CPDF in the currency exchange databases, it is shown that the
results are well fitted by our analytical expression. The analytical CPDF can
be also used to calculate the conditional expectation and the conditional
variance of velocity. Interestingly, the two databases show that the
conditional expectation of the velocity between two adjacent time intervals is
not monotonic, while the conditional variance tends to monotonic. All of these
results are well described by our theory. It is worthwhile to note that the
analytical CPDF is a general expression. It is valid not only for current
exchange systems but also for any complex systems having long-range
interactions and/or long-duration memory.

important role in adult mammalian homeostasis. It is well understood that the
two types of cell divisions differ in terms of the stem cells' flexibility to
expand when needed. On the contrary, the implications of symmetric and
asymmetric divisions for mutation accumulation are still poorly understood. In
this paper we study a stochastic model of a renewing tissue, and address the

symmetrically-dividing cells generate such mutants at a rate which is
significantly lower than that of asymmetrically-dividing cells. This result
holds whether single-hit (intermediate) mutants are disadvantageous, neutral,
or advantageous. It is also independent on whether the carcinogenic double-hit
mutants are produced only among the stem cells or also among more
differentiated cells. We argue that symmetric stem cell divisions in mammals
could be an adaptation which helps delay the onset of cancers. We further
investigate the question of the optimal fraction of stem cells in the tissue,
and quantify the contribution of non-stem cells in mutant production. Our work
provides a hypothesis to explain the observation that in mammalian cells,
symmetric patterns of stem cell division seem to be very common.

among countries even while life expectancy has continued to increase. How and
why does mortality change generate this diversity? We derive a precise link
between changes in age-specific mortality and lifespan inequality, measured as
the variance of age at death. Key to this relationship is a young-old threshold
age, below and above which mortality decline respectively decreases and
increases lifespan inequality. First, we show that shifts in the threshold's
location modified the correlation between changes in life expectancy and
lifespan inequality over the last two centuries. Second, we analyze the post
Second World War trajectories of lifespan inequality in a set of developed
countries, Japan, Canada and the United States (US), where thresholds centered
on retirement age. Our method reveals how divergence in the age-pattern of
mortality change drives international divergence in lifespan inequality. Most
strikingly, early in the 1980s, mortality increases in young US males led
lifespan inequality to remain high in the US, while in Canada the decline of
inequality continued. In general, our wider international comparisons show that
mortality change varied most at young working ages after the Second World War,
particularly for males. We conclude that if mortality continues to stagnate at
young ages, yet declines steadily at old ages, increases in lifespan inequality
will become a common feature of future demographic change.

the reconstruction method provides more accurate restoration than naive methods

comprises both direct competition between species as in the cyclic
Lotka-Volterra model, and separated selection and reproduction processes as in
the May-Leonard model. We show that the dynamic processes leading to the
transient maintenance of biodiversity are closely linked to attractors of the
nonlinear dynamics for the overall species' concentrations. The characteristics
of these global attractors change qualitatively at certain threshold values of
the mobility, and depend on the relative strength of the different types of
competition between species. They give information about the scaling of
extinction times with the system size and thereby the stability of
biodiversity. We define an effective free energy as the negative logarithm of
the probability to find the system in a specific global state before reaching
one of the absorbing states. The global attractors then correspond to minima of
this effective energy landscape and determine the most probable values for the
species' global concentrations. As in equilibrium thermodynamics, qualitative
changes in the effective free energy landscape indicate and characterize the
underlying non-equilibrium phase transitions. We provide the complete phase
diagrams for the population dynamics, and give a comprehensive analysis of the

Rb and Cs) have been investigated by magnetic susceptibility and isothermal
magnetization measurements at various temperatures. The ferromagnetic phase
transition temperatures are estimated as $\approx$ 74 K and 76 K and 62 K for A
= K, Rb and Cs (in case of high magnetic field), respectively. The
susceptibility data in the paramagnetic state obey the modified Curie-Weiss law
quite well and the derived effective magnetic moments of the Co atom are about
2.21, 2.04 and 2.04 \mu_B/Co and the corresponding spontaneous moments derived
at the ground state are 0.72, 0.59 and 0.52 \mu_B/Co as well as the generalized
Rhodes-Wohlfarth ratios as 3.07, 3.42 and 3.96 for A= K, Rb and Cs,
respectively. The magnetic moment aligns within ab-plane and a
metamagnetism-like behavior occurs at a field of 3.5 T in CsCo_2Se_2 with
H//ab-plane. The magnetic properties in this system were discussed within the
frameworks of the self-consistent renormalization (SCR) and Takahashi's theory
of spin fluctuations.

vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) propagation characteristics vary greatly on both

system-level Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) simulators by and large employ
simple statistical propagation models, which do not account for surrounding
objects explicitly. We designed GEMV$^2$ (Geometry-based Efficient propagation
Model for V2V communication), which uses outlines of vehicles, buildings, and
foliage to distinguish the following three types of links: line of sight (LOS),
non-LOS due to vehicles, and non- LOS due to static objects. For each link,
GEMV$^2$ calculates the large-scale signal variations deterministically,
whereas the small- scale signal variations are calculated stochastically based
on the number and size of surrounding objects. We implement GEMV$^2$ in MATLAB
and show that it scales well by using it to simulate radio propagation for
city-wide networks with tens of thousands of vehicles on commodity hardware. We
make the source code of GEMV$^2$ freely available. Finally, we validate
GEMV$^2$ against extensive measurements performed in urban, suburban, highway,

electrons in semiconductor crystals. This brings several complications: the
Pauli principle prevents the carriers from moving with the same speed; Coulomb
repulsion leads to rapid dephasing of electron flows. Spin-optronics is a
valuable alternative to traditional spintronics. In spin-optronic devices the
spin currents are carried by electrically neutral bosonic quasi-particles:
excitons or exciton-polaritons. They can form highly coherent quantum liquids
and carry spins over macroscopic distances. The price to pay is a finite
life-time of the bosonic spin carriers. We present the theory of exciton
ballistic spin transport which may be applied to a range of systems where
bosonic spin transport has been reported, in particular, to indirect excitons
in coupled GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells. We describe the effect of spin-orbit
interaction of electrons and holes on the exciton spin, account for the Zeeman
effect induced by external magnetic fields, long range and short range exchange
splittings of the exciton resonances. We also consider exciton transport in the
non-linear regime and discuss the definitions of exciton spin current,
polarization current and spin conductivity.

two-valued logic. Soon, however, it was realised that three-valued logic had
some natural advantages, as it provides distinct values not only for truth and
falsehood, but also for ""undefined"". The three-valued semantics proposed by
Fitting and by Kunen are closely related to what is computed by a logic
program, the third truth value being associated with non-termination. A
different three-valued semantics, proposed by Naish, shared much with those of
Fitting and Kunen but incorporated allowances for programmer intent, the third
truth value being associated with underspecification. Naish used an
(apparently) novel ""arrow"" operator to relate the intended meaning of left and
right sides of predicate definitions. In this paper we suggest that the
additional truth values of Fitting/Kunen and Naish are best viewed as duals. We
use Belnap's four-valued logic, also used elsewhere by Fitting, to unify the
two three-valued approaches. The truth values are arranged in a bilattice which
supports the classical ordering on truth values as well as the ""information
ordering"". We note that the ""arrow"" operator of Naish (and our four-valued
extension) is essentially the information ordering, whereas the classical arrow
denotes the truth ordering. This allows us to shed new light on many aspects of
logic programming, including program analysis, type and mode systems,
declarative debugging and the relationships between specifications and

scenario leading to AD, namely transitions among AD, generalized anticipatory

synchronization (GLS). This transition is mediated by variation of the
difference of {\it intrinsic time-delays} associated with the individual

the error function of proper synchronization manifold and a modified form of

multi-timescale stochastic exogenous processes in wireless communication
networks. Due to the hierarchical information structure in a wireless network,
a mixed timescale stochastic iterative algorithm is proposed to track the
time-varying optimal solution of the cross-layer optimization problem, where
the variables are partitioned into short-term controls updated in a faster
timescale, and long-term controls updated in a slower timescale. We focus on
establishing a convergence analysis framework for such multi-timescale
algorithms, which is difficult due to the timescale separation of the algorithm
and the time-varying nature of the exogenous processes. To cope with this
challenge, we model the algorithm dynamics using stochastic differential
equations (SDEs) and show that the study of the algorithm convergence is
equivalent to the study of the stochastic stability of a virtual stochastic
dynamic system (VSDS). Leveraging the techniques of Lyapunov stability, we
derive a sufficient condition for the algorithm stability and a tracking error
bound in terms of the parameters of the multi-timescale exogenous processes.
Based on these results, an adaptive compensation algorithm is proposed to
enhance the tracking performance. Finally, we illustrate the framework by an
application example in wireless heterogeneous network.

the fingerprints of planetesimal systems. Their solar system's counterparts are
the asteroid and Edgeworth-Kuiper belts. The DUNES survey aims at detecting
extra-solar analogues to the Edgeworth-Kuiper belt around solar-type stars,
putting in this way the solar system into context. The survey allows us to
address some questions related to the prevalence and properties of planetesimal
systems. We used {\it Herschel}/PACS to observe a sample of nearby FGK stars.
Data at 100 and 160 $\mu$m were obtained, complemented in some cases with
observations at 70 $\mu$m, and at 250, 350 and 500 $\mu$m using SPIRE. The
observing strategy was to integrate as deep as possible at 100 $\mu$m to detect
the stellar photosphere. Debris discs have been detected at a fractional
luminosity level down to several times that of the Edgeworth-Kuiper belt. The
incidence rate of discs around the DUNES stars is increased from a rate of
$\sim$ 12.1% $\pm$ 5% before \emph{Herschel} to $\sim$ 20.2% $\pm$ 2%. A
significant fraction ($\sim$ 52%) of the discs are resolved, which represents
an enormous step ahead from the previously known resolved discs. Some stars are
associated with faint far-IR excesses attributed to a new class of cold discs.
Although it cannot be excluded that these excesses are produced by coincidental
alignment of background galaxies, statistical arguments suggest that at least
some of them are true debris discs. Some discs display peculiar SEDs with
spectral indexes in the 70-160$\mu$m range steeper than the Rayleigh-Jeans one.
An analysis of the debris disc parameters suggests that a decrease might exist
of the mean black body radius from the F-type to the K-type stars. In addition,
a weak trend is suggested for a correlation of disc sizes and an
anticorrelation of disc temperatures with the stellar age.

  Rapid technological progress in DNA sequencing has stimulated interest in
compressing the vast datasets that are now routinely produced. Relatively
little attention has been paid to compressing the quality scores that are
assigned to each sequence, even though these scores may be harder to compress
than the sequences themselves. By aggregating a set of reads into a compressed
index, we find that the majority of bases can be predicted from the sequence of
bases that are adjacent to them and hence are likely to be less informative for
variant calling or other applications. The quality scores for such bases are
aggressively compressed, leaving a relatively small number at full resolution.
Since our approach relies directly on redundancy present in the reads, it does
not need a reference sequence and is therefore applicable to data from
metagenomics and de novo experiments as well as to resequencing data.
  Results:
  We show that a conservative smoothing strategy affecting 75% of the quality
scores above Q2 leads to an overall quality score compression of 1 bit per
value with a negligible effect on variant calling. A compression of 0.68 bit
per quality value is achieved using a more aggressive smoothing strategy, again
with a very small effect on variant calling.

(partially) massless fields in the bulk and (higher-order) conformal scalars,
i.e. singletons, as well as (higher-depth) conformal gauge fields on the

equations as obstructions to the extension of the off-shell boundary value to
the bulk, generalizing the usual considerations for the holographic anomalies
to the partially massless fields. We also relate the background fields for the
higher-order singleton to the boundary values of partially massless fields and
prove the appropriate generalization of the Flato-Fronsdal theorem, which is in
agreement with the known structure of symmetries for the higher-order wave
operator. All these facts support the following generalization of the
higher-spin holographic duality: the O(N) model at a multicritical isotropic
Lifshitz point should be dual to the theory of partially massless symmetric
tensor fields described by the Vasiliev equations based on the higher-order

convolutional code (LDPCCC). Specifically, the LDPCCC is derived from a
quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC block code. By making use of the quasi-cyclic structure,
the proposed LDPCCC decoder adopts a dynamic message storage in the memory and
uses a simple address controller. The decoder efficiently combines the memories
in the pipelining processors into a large memory block so as to take advantage
of the data-width of the embedded memory in a modern field-programmable gate
array (FPGA). A rate-5/6 QC-LDPCCC has been implemented on an Altera Stratix
FPGA. It achieves up to 2.0 Gb/s throughput with a clock frequency of 100 MHz.
Moreover, the decoder displays an excellent error performance of lower than
$10^{-13}$ at a bit-energy-to-noise-power-spectral-density ratio ($E_b/N_0$) of
3.55 dB.

space is a dynamic environment characterized by a huge number of elements.
Furthermore, many Web services are offering similar functionalities. In this
paper we propose a model for Web service composition designed to address the
scale effect and the redundancy issue. The Web services space is represented by
a two-layered network architecture. A concrete similarity network layer
organizes the Web services operations into communities of functionally similar
operations. An abstract interaction network layer represents the composition
relationships between the sets of communities. Composition synthesis is
performed by a two-phased graph search algorithm. First, the interaction
network is mined in order to discover abstract solutions to the request goal.
Then, the abstract compositions are instantiated with concrete operations
selected from the similarity network. This strategy allows an efficient
exploration of the Web services space. Furthermore, operations grouped in a
community can be easily substituted if necessary during the composition's
synthesis's process.

initial configuration of the network. As the number of initial nodes and their
degree grow, so does the time needed for an equilibrium degree distribution to
be established. We study this phenomenon, provide estimates of the
equilibration time, and characterize the degree distribution cutoff observed at
finite times. When the initial network is dense and exceeds a certain small
size, there is no equilibration and a suitable statistical test can always
discern the produced degree distribution from the equilibrium one. As a
by-product, the weighted Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic is demonstrated to be
more suitable for statistical analysis of power-law distributions with cutoff
when the data is ample.

not possible to apply the laws of motion ab initio. The concept of
meta-structure relates to the emergence of forms of spatiotemporal coherences
in collective behaviours intended as coherent sequences of multiple structures.
The essential difference compared with traditional methods is the role of the
cognitive design by the observer when identifying multiple mesoscopic
variables. The goal is both to study the ""change without physics"" of the
dynamics of change and to design non-catastrophic interventions having the
purpose to induce, change, keep or restore collective behaviours by influencing
-at the mesoscopic level -and not prescribing explicit rules and changes.

Mpc scales, small-scale (~100 kpc) fluctuations are suppressed by pressure
support, analogous to the classical Jeans argument. This Jeans filtering scale
has fundamental cosmological implications: it provides a thermal record of heat
injected by UV photons during reionization events, determines the clumpiness of
the IGM, and sets the minimum mass scale for gravitational collapse, a key
quantity in galaxy formation. Unfortunately, it is extremely challenging to
measure via the standard analysis of purely longitudinal Lyman-alpha forest
spectra, because the thermal Doppler broadening of absorption lines is highly
degenerate with Jeans pressure smoothing. In this work we show that the Jeans
scale can be directly measured by characterizing the coherence of correlated
Lyman-alpha absorption in quasar pairs with separations small enough to resolve
it. We present a novel technique for this purpose, based on the probability
distribution function (PDF) of phase angle differences of homologous
longitudinal Fourier modes in close quasar pair spectra. A Bayesian formalism
is introduced based on the phase angle PDF, and MCMC techniques are used to
characterize the precision of a future Jeans scale measurement, and explore
degeneracies with other thermal parameters governing the IGM. A semi-analytical
model of the IGM is used to generate a grid of 500 thermal models from a dark
matter simulation. Our full parameter study indicates that a realistic sample
of only 20 close quasar pair spectra can pinpoint the Jeans scale to ~ 5%
precision, independent of the parameters governing the temperature-density
relation of the IGM. We show that this new method is insensitive to a battery
of systematics such as continuum fitting errors, imprecise knowledge of the
noise and spectral resolution, and metal-line absorption.

superconductor--ferromagnet--singlet superconductor junction. We show that the
interaction of tunneling Cooper pairs with the interface magnetization can
permit a Josephson current at the lowest order of a tunneling Hamiltonian
perturbation theory. Two conditions must be satisfied for this to occur: the
magnetization of the ferromagnet has a component parallel to the ${\bf
d}$-vector of the triplet superconductor, and the gaps of the superconductors
have the same parity with respect to the interface momentum. The resulting
charge current displays an unconventional dependence on the orientation of the
magnetic moment and the phase difference. This is accompanied by a
phase-dependent spin current in the triplet superconductor, while a
phase-independent spin current is always present. The tunneling perturbation
theory predictions are confirmed using a numerical Green's function method. An
analytical treatment of a one-dimensional junction demonstrates that our
conclusions are robust far away from the tunneling regime, and reveals
signatures of the unconventional Josephson effect in the critical currents.

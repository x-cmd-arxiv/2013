blazar jets, imply high energy photon and neutrino emissions due to
interactions of high-energy protons with matter and/or radiation in the source
environment. Aims: This paper shows that the sensitivity of the IceCube
neutrino telescope in its 40-string configuration (IC-40) is already at the
level of constraining the parameter space of purely hadronic scenarios of
activity of blazars. Methods: Assuming that the entire source power originates
from hadronic interactions, and assuming that the models describe the data, we
estimate the expected neutrino flux from blazars based on the observed
gamma-ray flux by Fermi, simultaneously with IC-40 observations. We consider
two cases separately to keep the number of constrainable parameters at an
acceptable level: proton-proton or proton-gamma interactions are dominant.
Comparing the IC-40 sensitivity to the neutrino flux expected from some of the
brightest blazars, we constrain model parameters characterizing the parent
high-energy proton spectrum. Results: We find that when pp interactions
dominate, some constraints on the primary proton spectrum can be imposed. For
instance, for the tightest constrained source 3C 454.3, the very high energy
part of the spectra of blazars is constrained to be harder than E^-2 with
cut-off energies in the range of Ecut >10^18 eV. When interactions of
high-energy protons on soft photon fields dominate, we can find similarly tight
constraints on the proton spectrum parameters. [abridged]

young stellar object LkHalpha101, made with the IRAM interferometer and 30m
telescope. Several recombination lines, including higher order transitions,
were detected for the first time at radio wavelengths in this source. From
three alpha-transitions we derive an accurate value for the stellar velocity
and, for the first time, an unambiguous expansion velocity of the wind which is
55 km/s, much slower than reported previously, and the mass loss rate is 1.8e-6
solar masses per year. The wide band continuum spectra and the interferometer
visibilities show that the density of the wind falls off more steeply than
compatible with constant-velocity expansion. We argue that these properties
indicate that the wind is launched from a radially narrow region of the
circumstellar disk, and we propose that slow speed and a steep density gradient
are characteristic properties of the evolutionary phase where young stars of
intermediate and high mass clear away the gaseous component of their accretion
disks.
  The recombination lines are emitted close to local thermal equilibrium, but
the higher order transitions appear systematically broader and weaker than
expected, probably due to impact broadening. Finally, we show that LkHalpha101
shares many properties with MWC349, the only other stellar wind source where
radio recombination lines have been detected, some of them masing. We argue
that LkHalpha101 evades masing at millimeter wavelengths because of the disk's
smaller size and unfavorable orientation. Some amplification may however be
detectable at shorter wavelengths.

partial differential equation (PDE) with affine parameter dependence using a
goal-oriented approach by finite element (FE) and reduced basis (RB) methods.
The main contribution of this paper is the ""goal-oriented"" proper orthogonal
decomposition (POD)-Greedy sampling procedure within the RB approximation
context. First, we introduce the RB recipe: Galerkin projection onto a space
$Y_N$ spanned by solutions of the governing PDE at $N$ selected points in
parameter space. This set of $N$ parameter points is constructed by the
standard POD-Greedy sampling procedure already developed. Second, based on the
affine parameter dependence, we make use of the offline-online computational
procedures: in the offline stage, we generate the RB space; in the online
stage, given a new parameter value, we calculate rapidly and accurately the
space-time RB output of interest and its associated asymptotic error. The
proposed goal-oriented POD-Greedy sampling procedure can now be implemented and
will look for the parameter points such that it minimizes this (asymptotic)
output error rather than the solution error (or, error indicator which is the
dual norm of residual) as in the standard POD-Greedy procedure. Numerical
results show that the new goal-oriented POD-Greedy sampling procedure improves
significantly the accuracy of the space-time output computation in comparison
with the standard POD-Greedy one. The method is thus ideally suited for
repeated, rapid and reliable evaluation of input-output relationships within
the space-time setting.

allows to sense human behavior at unprecedented levels of details and scale.
Wearable sensors are opening up a new window on human mobility and proximity at
the finest resolution of face-to-face proximity. As a consequence, empirical
data describing social and behavioral networks are acquiring a longitudinal
dimension that brings forth new challenges for analysis and modeling. Here we
review recent work on the representation and analysis of temporal networks of
face-to-face human proximity, based on large-scale datasets collected in the
context of the SocioPatterns collaboration. We show that the raw behavioral
data can be studied at various levels of coarse-graining, which turn out to be
complementary to one another, with each level exposing different features of
the underlying system. We briefly review a generative model of temporal contact
networks that reproduces some statistical observables. Then, we shift our focus
from surface statistical features to dynamical processes on empirical temporal
networks. We discuss how simple dynamical processes can be used as probes to
expose important features of the interaction patterns, such as burstiness and
causal constraints. We show that simulating dynamical processes on empirical
temporal networks can unveil differences between datasets that would otherwise
look statistically similar. Moreover, we argue that, due to the temporal
heterogeneity of human dynamics, in order to investigate the temporal
properties of spreading processes it may be necessary to abandon the notion of
wall-clock time in favour of an intrinsic notion of time for each individual
node, defined in terms of its activity level. We conclude highlighting several
open research questions raised by the nature of the data at hand.

constructed in the north of the Netherlands and across europe. Utilizing a
novel phased-array design, LOFAR covers the largely unexplored low-frequency
range from 10-240 MHz and provides a number of unique observing capabilities.
Spreading out from a core located near the village of Exloo in the northeast of
the Netherlands, a total of 40 LOFAR stations are nearing completion. A further
five stations have been deployed throughout Germany, and one station has been
built in each of France, Sweden, and the UK. Digital beam-forming techniques
make the LOFAR system agile and allow for rapid repointing of the telescope as
well as the potential for multiple simultaneous observations. With its dense
core array and long interferometric baselines, LOFAR achieves unparalleled
sensitivity and angular resolution in the low-frequency radio regime. The LOFAR
facilities are jointly operated by the International LOFAR Telescope (ILT)
foundation, as an observatory open to the global astronomical community. LOFAR
is one of the first radio observatories to feature automated processing
pipelines to deliver fully calibrated science products to its user community.
LOFAR's new capabilities, techniques and modus operandi make it an important
pathfinder for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). We give an overview of the
LOFAR instrument, its major hardware and software components, and the core
science objectives that have driven its design. In addition, we present a

oscillations (HF QPOs) and known mass of the central black hole, the black-hole
dimensionless spin can be determined by assuming a concrete version of the
resonance model. However, a wide range of observationally limited values of the
black hole mass implies low precision of the spin estimates. We discuss the
possibility of higher precision of the black hole spin measurements in the
framework of a multi-resonance model inspired by observations of more than two
HF QPOs in the black hole systems, which are expected to occur at two (or more)
different radii of the accretion disc. For the black hole systems we focus on
the special case of duplex frequencies, when the top, bottom, or mixed
frequency is common at two different radii where the resonances occur giving
triple frequency sets. The sets of triple frequency ratios and the related spin
are given. The strong resonance model for ""magic"" values of the black hole spin
means that two (or more) versions of resonance could occur at the same radius,
allowing cooperative effects between the resonances. For neutron star systems
we introduce a resonant switch model that assumes switching of oscillatory
modes at resonant points. In the case of doubled twin-peak HF QPOs excited at
two different radii with common top, bottom, or mixed frequency, the black hole
spin is given by the triple frequency ratio set. The spin is determined
precisely, but not uniquely, because the same frequency set could correspond to
more than one concrete spin. The black hole mass is given by the magnitude of
the observed frequencies. The resonant switch model puts relevant limits on the
mass and spin of neutron stars, and we expect a strong increase in the fitting
procedure precision when different twin oscillatory modes are applied to data
in the vicinity of different resonant points.

spontaneously `overcharge'; i.e., the negative charge of the NA exceeds the
positive charge on capsid. When applied to specific viruses, the optimal NA
lengths closely correspond to the natural genome lengths. Calculations based on
linear polyelectrolytes rather than base-paired NAs underpredict the optimal
length, demonstrating the importance of NA structure to capsid assembly. These
results suggest that electrostatics, excluded volume, and NA tertiary structure
are sufficient to predict assembly thermodynamics and that the ability of
viruses to selectively encapsidate their genomic NAs can be explained, at least
in part, on a thermodynamic basis.

symmetry to ensure a prolonged slow-roll background evolution. The symmetry
dictates which operators are allowed, and these in turn determine the
observational predictions of this class of models, which include observable
gravitational waves (potentially chiral), oscillations in all primordial
correlators, specific deviations from scale invariance and Gaussianity and
primordial black holes. We discuss the constraints on this class of models in
light of the recent Planck results and comment on future perspectives. The
shift symmetry is very useful in models of large-field inflation, which
typically have monomial potentials, but it cannot explain why two or more terms
in the potential are fine-tuned against each other, as needed for typical
models of small-field inflation. Therefore some additional symmetries or
fine-tuning will be needed if forthcoming experiments will constrain the

by $a_1^{\xi(S)}$ and $a_2^{\xi(S)}$, where $\xi(S)$ is the complexity of the
surface. As a consequence, we give the first computable bounds on the
asymptotic dimension of curve graphs and mapping class groups.
  Our techniques involve a generalization of Masur--Minsky's tight geodesics
and a new class of paths on which their tightening procedure works.

and complex control-plane protocols. To address these challenges, we present
SoftCell, a scalable architecture for supporting fine-grained policies for
mobile devices in cellular core networks. The SoftCell controller realizes
high-level service polices by directing traffic over paths that traverse a
sequence of middleboxes, optimized to the network conditions and user
locations. To ensure scalability, the core switches forward traffic on
hierarchical addresses (grouped by base station) and policy tags (identifying
paths through middleboxes). This minimizes data-plane state in the core
switches, and pushes all fine-grained state to software switches at the base
stations. These access switches apply fine-grained rules, specified by the
controller, to map all traffic to the appropriate addresses and tags. SoftCell
guarantees that packets in the same connection traverse the same sequence of
middleboxes in both directions, even in the presence of mobility. Our
characterization of real LTE workloads, micro-benchmarks on our prototype
controller, and large-scale simulations demonstrate that SoftCell improves the
flexibility of cellular core networks, while enabling the use of inexpensive
commodity switches and middleboxes.

overdensity both in redshift space, and in the spatial distribution of galaxies
close to the center of the extended X-ray emission. The cluster core region
(r<200 kpc) shows a clearly enhanced passive fraction with respect to field
levels. However, together with a population of massive passive galaxies mostly
with early-type morphologies, it also hosts massive actively star-forming,
often highly dust-reddened sources. Close to the cluster center, a
multi-component system of passive and star-forming galaxies could be the future
BCG still assembling. We observe a clear correlation between passive stellar
populations and an early-type morphology, in agreement with field studies at
similar redshift. Passive early-type galaxies in this clusters are typically a
factor 2-3 smaller than similarly massive early-types at z~0, but also on
average larger by a factor ~2 than their field analogs at z~2, lending support
to recent claims of an accelerated structural evolution in high-redshift dense
environments. These results point towards the early formation of a population
of massive galaxies, already evolved both in their structure and stellar
populations, coexisting with still-actively forming massive galaxies in the
central regions of young clusters 10 billion years ago.

machines since the late 1980s. In this paper, the authors present a conceptual
design of a 2.5 MW class synchronous motor. The structure of the motor is
specified and the motor performance is analyzed via a three-dimensional model
using the finite element method (FEM). Rotor optimization is carried out to
decrease the harmonic components in the air gap field generated by HTS tapes.
Based on the results of this 3D simulation, the determination of the operating
conditions and load angle is discussed with consideration to the HTS material
properties. The economic viability of air-core and iron-core designs is
compared. The results show that this type of HTS machine has the potential to
achieve an economic, efficient and effective machine design, which operates at
a low load angle, and this design process provides a practical way to simulate
and analyze the performance of such machines.

of Time and Space operators; and with (iii) the problem of the four-position

applications of non-selfadjoint (and even non-hermitian) operators are briefly
discussed. We mention how non-hermitian operators can indeed be used in physics

understanding of the dark matter distribution in massive galaxies, galaxy
clusters and the background cosmology. Despite their importance, the number of
gravitational arcs discovered so far is small. The urge for more complete,
large samples and unbiased methods of selecting candidates is rising. A number
of methods for the automatic detection of arcs have been proposed in the
literature, but large amounts of spurious detections retrieved by these methods
forces observers to visually inspect thousands of candidates per square degree
in order to clean the samples. This approach is largely subjective and requires
a huge amount of eye-ball checking, especially considering the actual and
upcoming wide field surveys, which will cover thousands of square degrees. In
this paper we study the statistical properties of colours of gravitational arcs
detected in the 37 deg^2 of the CARS survey. We have found that most of them
lie in a relatively small region of the (g'-r',r'-i') colour-colour diagram. To

depth expected in a LCDM cosmology that, in combination with the sources'
redshift distribution of a given survey, in our case CARS, peaks for sources at
redshift z~1. By further modelling the colours derived from the SED of the
galaxies dominating the population at that redshift, the model well reproduces
the observed colours. By taking advantage of the colour selection suggested by

83% complete and a contamination reduced by a factor of ~6.5 with respect to

semi-major orbit axis (~ 180 R_sun), and the bulk of the source emission
observed in a limited portion of the orbit are consistent with a Be companion
star. The broad band 0.2-150 keV spectrum is well modeled with a flat absorbed
power law with a cut-off at ~16 keV. Finally, we explore the possible
association of 4U 1036-56 with the gamma-ray source AGL J1037-5808, finding

at $\sim 1000$ keV. We use the photospheric component to calculate the
properties of the relativistic outflow. We find a strong evolution in the flow
properties: the Lorentz factor decreases with time during the bursts from
$\Gamma \sim 1000$ to $\sim 150$ (assuming a redshift $z=2$; the values are
only weakly dependent on unknown efficiency parameters). Such a decrease is
contrary to the expectations from the internal shocks and the isolated magnetar
birth models. Moreover, the position of the flow nozzle measured from the
central engine, $r_0$, increases by more than two orders of magnitude. Assuming
a moderately magnetised outflow we estimate that $r_0$ varies from $10^6$ cm to
$\sim 10^9$ cm during the burst. We suggest that the maximal value reflects the
size of the progenitor core. Finally, we show that these jet properties
naturally explain the observed broken power-law decay of the temperature which

calibrators for those evolutionary stages that depend on free parameters.
However, discrepancies exist among different models, even if similar sets of
calibration clusters are used. With the aim of understanding these
discrepancies, and of improving the calibration procedure, we consider a set of
43 Magellanic Cloud (MC) clusters taking age and photometric information from
the literature. We carefully assign ages to each cluster based on up-to-date
determinations ensuring that these are as homogeneous as possible. To cope with
statistical fluctuations, we stack the clusters in five age bins deriving for
each of them integrated luminosities and colors. We find that clusters become
abruptly red in optical and optical-IR colors as they age from ~0.6 to 1 Gyr,
which we interpret as due to the development of a well-populated thermally
pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB). We argue that other studies missed
this detection because of coarser age binnings. Maraston (2005; M05) and
Girardi et al. (2010) models predict the presence of a populated TP-AGB at ~0.6
Gyr, with a correspondingly very red integrated color, at variance with the
data; Bruzual & Charlot (2003) and Conroy et al. (2009) models run within the
error bars at all ages. The discrepancy between the synthetic colors of M05
models and the average colors of MC clusters results from the now obsolete age
scale adopted. Finally, our finding that the TP-AGB phase appears to develop
between ~0.6-1 Gyr is dependent on the adopted age scale for the clusters and
may have important implications for stellar evolution.

support of their prediction. However, there have not been any numerical studies
to-date testing these results. We analyze the spatial power spectrum of MHD
simulations with a wide range of sonic and Alfv\'enic Mach numbers, which
include radiative transfer effects of the $^{13}$CO transition. We confirm
numerically the predictions of Lazarian & Pogosyan (2004) that the spectral
slope of line intensity maps of an optically thick medium saturates to -3.
Furthermore, for very optically thin supersonic CO gas, where the density or CO
abundance values are too low to excite emission in all but the densest shock
compressed gas, we find that the spectral slope is shallower than expected from
the column density. Finally, we find that mixed optically thin/thick CO gas,
which has average optical depths on order of unity, shows mixed behavior: for
super-Alfv\'enic turbulence, the integrated intensity power spectral slopes
generally follow the same trend with sonic Mach number as the true column
density power spectrum slopes. However, for sub-Alfv\'enic turbulence the

effects of Lorentz contraction and time dilation. We find that the Majorana
zero modes remain stable as long as the domain wall moves at subluminal
velocities with respect to the effective speed of light of the system. However,
the Majorana bound state dissolves into a continuous quasiparticle spectrum
once the domain wall propagates at luminal or even superluminal velocities.
This relativistic catastrophe implies that there is an upper limit for possible
braiding frequencies even in a perfectly clean system with an arbitrarily large
topological gap. We also exploit our exact solution to consider domain walls
moving past static impurities present in the system.

(2012) that NGC1277 hosts an
over-massive BH with a mass larger than half its spheroid mass. We revisit this
claim by examining the predictions from dynamical realisations based on new MGE
models of NGC1277. We present realisations which fit the observed photometry.
M/L is fixed following scaling relations which predict a Salpeter-like IMF. A
model without a BH provides a surprisingly good fit of the observed kinematics
outside the unresolved central region, but not, as expected, of the central
dispersion and h4 values. A model with a MBH of 5 10^9 Msun allows to fit the
dispersion profile, consistently with models of the same mass and M/L in
vdB+12. It departs from the central h4 values by only about twice the given
uncertainty. A slightly varying M/L or the addition of high velocity stars
would further lower the need for a very massive BH. These results do not rule
out the presence of an over-massive BH at the centre of NGC1277. However, they
lead us to advocate the use of 3-sigma confidence intervals for derived MBH as
better, more conservative, guidelines for such studies. We caution for the use
of ill-defined spheroidal components as an input for scaling relations, and
emphasise the fact that a MBH in the range 2-5 10^9 Msun would represent less
than 5% of the spheroid mass of our models. This would make the BH in NGC1277
consistent or just twice as large as what a recent version of the MBH-sigma
relation predicts. We examine the impact of the presence of a bar by running
simulations from the same MGE model but with extreme anisotropies. An inner
small bar forms, and an end-on view gets closer to fitting the central
dispersion profile without the need for a central BH, while adding a black hole
of 2.5 10^9 Msun, in line with the prediction from scaling relations, allows to
fit the dispersion peak and h3 profiles. EDITED and ABRIDGED.

refinement of the fully deuterated (TMTSF)$_2$PF$_6$-D12 salt allows locating
precisely the methyl groups at 4 K. This structure is compared to the one of
the fully hydrogenated (TMTSF)$_2$PF$_6$-H12 salt previously determined at the

application of a negative pressure of 5 x 10$^2$ MPa to the H12 salt. Accurate
measurements of the Bragg intensity show anomalous thermal variations at low
temperature both in the deuterated PF$_6$ and AsF$_6$ salts. Two different
thermal behaviors have been distinguished. Low-Bragg-angle measurements reflect
the presence of low-frequency modes at characteristic energies {\theta}$_E$ =
8.3 K and {\theta}$_E$ = 6.7 K for the PF$_6$-D12 and AsF$_6$-D12 salts,
respectively. These modes correspond to the low-temperature methyl group
motion. Large-Bragg-angle measurements evidence an unexpected structural change
around 55 K which probably corresponds to the linkage of the anions to the
methyl groups via the formation of F...D-CD2 bonds observed in the 4 K
structural refinement. Finally we show that the thermal expansion coefficient
of (TMTSF)$_2$PF$_6$ is dominated by the librational motion of the PF$_6$
units. We quantitatively analyze the low-temperature variation of the lattice
expansion via the contribution of Einstein oscillators, which allows us to

theoretically we construct a minimally parameterized framework that

physical process of inflammation into one quantitative setting. Simulations
suggest that while there are pro-tumor or antitumor immunogenic responses

response involves an initial period where tumor growth is stimulated beyond
that of growth without an immune response. The mathematical description is
non-identifiable which allows us to capture inherent biological variability in
tumor growth that can significantly alter tumor-immune dynamics and thus
treatment success rates. The ability of this model to predict immunomodulation

approaches that exploit immune response to improve tumor suppression, including
the potential attainment of an immune-induced dormant state.

equation (RDME) is severely limited by the large number of diffusion events if
the mesh is fine or if diffusion constants are large. Furthermore, inherent
properties of exact kinetic-Monte Carlo simulation methods limit the efficiency
of parallel implementations. Several approximate and hybrid methods have
appeared that enable more efficient simulation of the RDME. A common feature to
most of them is that they rely on splitting the system into its reaction and
diffusion parts and updating them sequentially over a discrete timestep. This
use of operator splitting enables more efficient simulation but it comes at the
price of a temporal discretization error that depends on the size of the
timestep. So far, existing methods have not attempted to estimate or control
this error in a systematic manner. This makes the solvers hard to use for
practitioners since they must guess an appropriate timestep. It also makes the
solvers potentially less efficient than if the timesteps are adapted to control
the error. Here, we derive estimates of the local error and propose a strategy
to adaptively select the timestep when the RDME is simulated via a first order
operator splitting. While the strategy is general and applicable to a wide
range of approximate and hybrid methods, we exemplify it here by extending a
previously published approximate method, the Diffusive Finite-State Projection
(DFSP) method, to incorporate temporal adaptivity.

characteristics including an extreme radial velocity and a highly retrograde
orbit, strongly suggesting an extraGalactic origin. Our aims are to study
NGC3201 in the context of multiple populations (MPs), hoping to constrain
possible candidates for the self-enrichment by studying the chemical abundance
pattern, as well as adding insight into the origin of this intriguing cluster.
We present a detailed chemical abundance analysis of eight red giant branch
(RGB) stars using high resolution spectroscopy. We measured 29 elements and
found [Fe/H]=-1.53+/-0.01, we cannot rule out a metallicity spread of ~0.12
dex, and an alpha-enhancement typical of halo GCs. However significant spreads
are observed in the abundances of all light elements except for Mg. We confirm
the presence of an extended Na-O anticorrelation. n-capture elements generally
are dominated by the r-process, in good agreement with the bulk of Galactic
GCs. The total (C+N+O) abundance is slightly supersolar and requires a small
downward correction to the isochrone age, yielding 11.4 Gyr. Kinematically,
NGC3201 appears likely to have had an extraGalactic origin but its chemical
evolution is similar to most other, presumably native, Galactic GCs.

reconnecting magnetic fields are symmetric. We relax this assumption by
performing two-dimensional resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the
plasmoid instability during asymmetric inflow magnetic reconnection. Magnetic
asymmetry modifies the onset, scaling, and dynamics of this instability.
Magnetic islands develop preferentially into the weak magnetic field upstream
region. Outflow jets from individual X-points impact plasmoids obliquely rather
than directly as in the symmetric case. Consequently, deposition of momentum by
the outflow jets into the plasmoids is less efficient, the plasmoids develop
net vorticity, and shear flow slows down secondary merging between islands.
Secondary merging events have asymmetry along both the inflow and outflow
directions. Downstream plasma is more turbulent in cases with magnetic
asymmetry because islands are able to roll around each other after exiting the
current sheet. As in the symmetric case, plasmoid formation facilitates faster
reconnection for at least small and moderate magnetic asymmetries. However,
when the upstream magnetic field strengths differ by a factor of four, the
reconnection rate plateaus at a lower value than expected from scaling the
symmetric results. We perform a parameter study to investigate the onset of the
plasmoid instability as a function of magnetic asymmetry and domain size. There
exist domain sizes for which symmetric simulations are stable but asymmetric
simulations are unstable, suggesting that moderate magnetic asymmetry is
somewhat destabilizing. We discuss the implications for plasmoid and flux rope
formation in solar eruptions, laboratory reconnection experiments, and space
plasmas. The differences between symmetric and asymmetric simulations provide
some hints regarding the nature of the three-dimensional plasmoid instability.

the identity of Alice's spin (i.e., the probability space on which it is
defined as a random variable) is determined only by the axis \alphai chosen by
Alice, irrespective of Bob's axis \betaj (and vice versa). Here, we study
contextual KPT models, with two properties: (1) Alice's and Bob's spins are
identified as Aij and Bij, even though their distributions are determined by,
respectively, \alphai alone and \betaj alone, in accordance with the
no-signaling requirement; and (2) the joint distributions of the spins Aij,Bij
across all values of \alphai,\betaj are constrained by fixing distributions of
some subsets thereof. Of special interest among these subsets is the set of
probabilistic connections, defined as the pairs \left(Aij,Aij'\right) and
\left(Bij,Bi'j\right) with \alphai\not=\alphai' and \betaj\not=\betaj' (the
non-contextuality assumption is obtained as a special case of connections, with
zero probabilities of Aij\not=Aij' and Bij\not=Bi'j). Thus, one can achieve a
complete KPT characterization bof the Bell-type inequalities, or Tsirelson's
inequalities, by specifying the distributions of probabilistic connections
compatible with those and only those spin pairs \left(Aij,Bij\right) that are
subject to these inequalities. We show, however, that quantum-mechanical (QM)
constraints are special. No-forcing theorem says that if a set of probabilistic
connections is not compatible with correlations violating QM, then it is
compatible only with the classical-mechanical correlations. No-matching theorem
says that there are no subsets of the spin variables Aij,Bij whose

stars has been the subject of active investigation over the past three decades.
Although several solar twins have been found with stellar parameters similar to
those of the Sun (albeit in a range of Li abundances and with somewhat
different compositions), their rotation periods are unknown, except for 18 Sco,
which is younger than the Sun and with a rotation period shorter than solar. It
is difficult to obtain rotation periods for stars of solar age from
ground-based observations, as a low activity level imply a shallow rotational
modulation of their light curves. CoRoT has provided space-based long time
series from which the rotation periods of solar twins as old as the Sun could
be estimated. Based on high S/N high resolution spectroscopic observations
gathered at the Subaru Telescope, we show that the star CoRoT ID 102684698
(CoRoT Sol 1) is a somewhat evolved solar twin with a low Li abundance. Its
rotation period is 29 +- 5 days, compatible with its age (6.7 Gyr) and low
lithium content A(Li) < 0.85 dex. Interestingly, our CoRoT solar twin seems to
have enhanced abundances of the refractory elements with respect to the Sun, a
typical characteristic of most nearby twins. With a magnitude V ~14.1, ID
102684698 is the first solar twin revealed by CoRoT, the farthest field solar
twin so far known, and the only solar twin older than the Sun for which a
rotation period has been determined.

  We consider 3-dimensional AlSch space-times that are solutions of the massive

that this is intimately connected with the special role played by particle

2). N is a Killing vector (but not necessarily null). 3). N is null everywhere

properties, such as internal velocity dispersions and colour-magnitude trends,
suggesting tidally stripped dwarf galaxies as a possible UCD origin. However,
UCDs typically have sizes more than twice as large as nuclei at the same
luminosity. We use a GPU-enabled version of the particle-mesh code
\textsc{superbox} to study the possibility of turning nucleated dwarf galaxies
into UCDs by tidally stripping them in a Virgo-like galaxy cluster. We find
that motion in spherical potentials, where close passages happen many times,
leads to the formation of compact ($r_h \lesssim 20$ pc) star clusters/UCDs. In
contrast, orbital motion where close passages happen only once or twice leads
to the formation of extended objects which are large enough to account for the
full range of observed UCD sizes. For such motion, we find that dwarf galaxies
need close pericentre passages with distances less than 10 kpc to undergo
strong enough stripping so that UCD formation is possible. As tidal stripping
produces objects with similar properties to UCDs, and our estimates suggest
dwarf galaxies have been destroyed in sufficient numbers to explain the
observed number of UCDs in M87, we consider tidal stripping to be a likely
origin of UCDs. However, comparison with cosmological simulations is needed to
determine if the number and spatial distribution of UCDs formed by tidal
stripping matches the observations of UCDs in galaxy clusters.

Complex dynamics has been previously found in the systems of multiple learning

considered trivially stable. We advocate the idea that adopting a more complex
model of the individual behavior may result in a more diverse spectrum of
macro-level behaviors. We develop an adaptation model based on the
reinforcement learning framework extended by an additional processing channel.
We scrutiny the dynamics of the single agent adapting to the unknown
environment; the agent is biased by novelty seeking, the intrinsic inclination
for exploration. We demonstrate that the behavior of the novelty-seeking agent
may be inherently unstable. One of the surprising results is that under certain
conditions the increase of the novelty-seeking level may cause the agent to
switch from the non-rational to the strictly rational behavior. Our results
give evidence to the hypothesis that the intrinsic motives of agents should be
paid no less attention than the extrinsic ones in the models of complex
socio-economic systems.

debris problem is the de-orbiting of objects in low Earth orbit through
irradiation by ground-based high-intensity pulsed lasers. Laser ablation of a
thin surface layer causes target recoil, resulting in the depletion of orbital
angular momentum and accelerated atmospheric re-entry. However, both the
magnitude and direction of the recoil are shape dependent, a feature of the
laser-based remediation concept that has received little attention. Since the
development of a predictive capability is desirable, we have investigated the
dynamical response to ablation of objects comprising a variety of shapes. We
derive and demonstrate a simple analytical technique for calculating the
ablation-driven transfer of linear momentum, emphasizing cases for which the
recoil is not exclusively parallel to the incident beam. For the purposes of
comparison and contrast, we examine one case of momentum transfer in the
low-intensity regime, where photon pressure is the dominant momentum transfer
mechanism, showing that shape and orientation effects influence the target
response in a similar, but not identical, manner. We address the related
problem of target spin and, by way of a few simple examples, show how ablation
can alter the spin state of a target, which often has a pronounced effect on

find all four galaxies have centrally-concentrated gradients in the young
stellar population contained within the central ~1 kpc. This is in agreement
with the Balmer line gradients found in local low luminosity E+A galaxies. The
results from higher redshift (z~0.1) samples of luminous E+A galaxies have been
varied, but in general have found the post-starburst signature to be extended
or a galaxy-wide phenomenon or have otherwise failed to detect gradients in the
stellar populations. The ubiquity of the detection of a centrally concentrated
young stellar population in local samples, and the presence of significant
radial gradients in the stellar populations when the E+A galaxy core is well
resolved raises the possibility that spatial resolution issues may be important
in interpreting the higher redshift results. The two early type E+A galaxies in
our sample that can be robustly kinematically classified, using the LambdaR
parameter, are fast-rotators. Combined with previous measurements, this brings
the total number of E+A galaxies with measurements of LambdaR to twenty-six,
with only four being classified as slow-rotators. This fraction is similar to
the fraction of the early-type population as a whole and argues against the
need for major mergers in the production of E+A galaxies, since major mergers
should result in an increased fraction of slow rotators.

classical actions for open systems, which follow from the generic structure of
effective actions in the Schwinger-Keldysh Closed-Time-Path formalism with two
time axes and a doubling of degrees of freedom. The central structural feature
of such effective actions is the coupling between degrees of freedom on the two
time axes. This reflects the fact that from an effective field theory point of
view, dissipation is the loss of energy of the low-energy hydrodynamical
degrees of freedom to the integrated-out, UV degrees of freedom of the
environment. The dynamics of only the hydrodynamical modes may therefore not
posses a conserved stress-energy tensor. After a general discussion of the CTP
effective actions, we use the variational principle to derive the
energy-momentum balance equation for a dissipative fluid from an effective
Goldstone action of the long-range hydrodynamical modes. Despite the absence of
conserved energy and momentum, we show that we can construct the first-order
dissipative stress-energy tensor and derive the Navier-Stokes equations near
hydrodynamical equilibrium. The shear viscosity is shown to vanish in the

the form of the effective action. We also discuss the thermodynamics of the

FID signals. The method employs high precision numerical integration rather
than simple summation as in many other techniques. With no independent
knowledge of the other parameters of a NMR FID signal (phase $\phi$, amplitude
$A$, and transverse relaxation time $T_{2}$) this method can determine the
signal frequency $f_{0}$ with a precision of $1/(8\pi^{2}f_{0}^{2}T_{2}^{2})$
if the observation time $T$ is long enough. The method is especially convenient
when the detailed shape of the observed FT NMR spectrum is not well defined.
When $T_{2}$ is $+\infty$ and the signal becomes pure sinusoidal, the precision
of the method is $3/(2\pi^{2}f_{0}^{2}T^{2})$ which is one order more precise
than a typical frequency counter. Analysis of this method shows that the
integration reduces the noise by bandwidth narrowing as in a lock-in amplifier,
and no extra signal filters are needed. For a pure sinusoidal signal we find
from numerical simulations that the noise-induced error in this method reaches
the Cramer-Rao Lower Band(CRLB) on frequency determination. For the damped
sinusoidal case of most interest, the noise-induced error is found to be within
a factor of 2 of CRLB when the measurement time $T$ is a few times larger than
$T_{2}$.We discuss possible improvements for the precision of this method.

photometric variability at the cool end of the stellar mass distribution. In
this paper, we present low-resolution red optical spectra that allow us to
identify 18 very low-mass stars that have Kepler light curves available in the
public archive. Spectral types of these targets are found to lie in the range
dM4.5--dM8.5, implying spectrophotometric distances from 17 pc to 80 pc. Limits
to the presence of transiting planets are placed from modelling of the Kepler
light curves. We find that the size of the planets detectable by Kepler around
these small stars typically lie in the range 1 to 5 Earth radii within the
habitable regions (P$\le$10 days). We identify one candidate transit with a
period of 1.26 days that resembles the signal produced by a planet slightly
smaller than the Moon. However, our pixel by pixel analysis of the Kepler data
shows that the signal most likely arises from a background contaminating
eclipsing binary. For 11 of these objects reliable photometric periods shorter
than 7 days are derived, and are interpreted as rotational modulation of
magnetic cool spots. For 3 objects we find possible photometric periods longer
than 50 days that require confirmation. H$_\alpha$ emission measurements and
flare rates are used as a proxies for chromospheric activity and transversal
velocities are used as an indicator of dynamical ages. These data allow us to
discuss the relationship between magnetic activity and detectability of
planetary transits around very low-mass stars. We show that Super-Earth planets
with sizes around 2 Earth radii are detectable with Kepler around about two
thirds of the stars in our sample, independently from their level of
chromospheric activity.

density modes of linear perturbation theory of dust sources by means of the
exact density perturbation from the formalism of quasi--local scalars
associated to weighed proper volume averages in LTB dust models. The relation
between these density modes and theoretical properties of generic LTB models is
thoroughly studied by looking at the evolution of the models through a
dynamical system whose phase space is parametrized by variables directly
related to the modes themselves. The conditions for absence of shell crossings,
as well as sign conditions on the modes, become interrelated fluid flow
preserved constraints that define phase space invariant subspaces. In the
general case (both density modes being nonzero) the evolution of phase space
trajectories exhibits the expected dominance of the decaying/growing in the
early/late evolution times defined by past/future attractors characterized by
asymptotic density inhomogeneity. In particular, the growing mode is also
dominant for collapsing layers that terminate in a future attractor associated
with a ""Big Crunch"" singularity, which is qualitatively different from the past
attractor marking the ""Big Bang"". Suppression of the decaying mode modifies the
early time evolution, with phase space trajectories emerging from an
Einstein--de Sitter past attractor associated with homogeneous conditions.
Suppression of the growing mode modifies the late time evolution as phase space
trajectories terminate in future attractors associated with homogeneous states.
General results are obtained relating the signs of the density modes and the
type of asymptotic density profile (clump or void). A critical review is given
of previous attempts in the literature to define these density modes for LTB
models.

geometric insights available into the space of phylogenetic trees, and ad hoc

ill-definition of the usual concepts of posterior mean, while bootstrap methods
mitigate the absence of a sound concept of variance. Yielding satisfactory
results with sufficiently concentrated posterior distributions, such methods

  Results: Building upon previous work of Billera et al., summary statistics
such as sample mean, median and variance are defined as the geometric median,
Fr\'echet mean and variance, respectively. Their computation is enabled by
recently published works, and embeds an algorithm for computing shortest paths
in the space of trees. Studying the phylogeny of a set of plants, where several
tree topologies occur in the posterior sample, the posterior mean balances
correctly the contributions from the different topologies, where a consensus
tree would be biased. Comparisons of the posterior mean, median and consensus
trees with the ground truth using simulated data also reveals the benefits of a
sound averaging method when reconstructing phylogenetic trees.

  procedure for effective particles","21 pages, plain latex",,"10.1103/PhysRevD.87.125032",,"hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Renormalization group procedure for effective particles is applied to the
model quantum theory of free fermions to which one adds an interaction in the
form of a mass mixing term. If one used a standard approach based on the
instant form of dynamics, the theory would suffer from a generic vacuum problem
caused by a divergent production of virtual quanta out of a bare vacuum and it
would require an adjustment of its degrees of freedom to the added interaction
term before quantization, considered a means of avoiding the quantum vacuum
problem. In the effective particle approach, the quantum vacuum problem is
dealt with instead by using the front form of dynamics, where the pair
production is excluded by momentum conservation. The corresponding Hamiltonian
includes mass parameters through constraint equations while the required
quantum field operators are constructed independently of all mass parameters,
including the parameters that appear in the added mass mixing interaction term.
Then the masses and states of physical fermions emerge at an end of the
non-perturbative calculation that is carried out entirely in one and the same
interacting quantum theory with a trivial vacuum and no quantization
adjustment. An a priori infinite set of renormalization group equations for all
momentum modes of fermion fields is reduced to just one equation for a
two-by-two mass squared matrix, thanks to 7 kinematical symmetries of the front
form (the instant form has only 6). For strong mass mixing interactions, the
fermion model solutions qualitatively differ from the analogous, earlier found
boson model solutions by the absence of tachyons.

a long standing problem. While it is known that network coding can outperform
routing and replication, the set of feasible rates is not known in general.
Characterizing the network coding capacity region requires determination of the
set of all entropic vectors. Furthermore, computing the explicitly known linear
programming bound is infeasible in practice due to an exponential growth in
complexity as a function of network size. This paper focuses on the fundamental
problems of characterization and computation of outer bounds for networks with
correlated sources. Starting from the known local functional dependencies
induced by the communications network, we introduce the notion of irreducible
sets, which characterize implied functional dependencies. We provide recursions
for computation of all maximal irreducible sets. These sets act as
information-theoretic bottlenecks, and provide an easily computable outer
bound. We extend the notion of irreducible sets (and resulting outer bound) for
networks with independent sources. We compare our bounds with existing bounds
in the literature. We find that our new bounds are the best among the known
graph theoretic bounds for networks with correlated sources and for networks
with independent sources.

  In this way we can independently treat two main roles of the regularization

a priori knowledge. For zero continuation parameter we solve a relaxed
regularization problem, which stabilizes the ill-posed problem in a weaker
sense. The problem is recast to the original minimization by the continuation
method and so the a priori knowledge is enforced.

active temperature defined, as in kinetic theory, as the mean square velocity,
and by the equal-time spatial correlations. Considering the phase in which the
swimmers are homogeneously and isotropically distributed in the fluid, it is
shown that the active temperature and velocity correlations depend on a single
scalar correlation function of the dipole-dipole correlation function. By
making a simple medium range oder model, in which the dipole-dipole correlation
function is characterized by a single correlation length $k_0^{-1}$ it is
possible to make quantitative predictions. It is found that the active
temperature depends on the system size, scaling as $L^{4-d}$ at large
correlation lengths $L\ll k_0^{-1}$, while in the opposite limit it saturates
in three dimensions and diverges logarithmically with the system size in two
dimensions. In three dimensions he velocity correlations decay as $1/r$ for
small correlation lengths, while at large correlation lengths the transverse
correlation function becomes negative at maximum separation $r\sim L/2$, effect
that disappears as the system increases in size.

despite a significant drop in the edge pressure gradient, which would be
expected to stabilise the peeling-ballooning modes thought to be responsible
for type-I ELMs. Various mechanisms which could cause a destabilisation of the
peeling-ballooning modes are presented, including pedestal widening, plasma
rotation braking, three dimensional corrugation of the plasma boundary and the
existence of radially extended lobe structures near to the X-point. This leads
to a model aimed at resolving the apparent dichotomy of ELM control, that is to
say ELM suppression occurring due to the pedestal pressure reduction below the
peeling-ballooning stability boundary, whilst the reduction in pressure can
also lead to ELM mitigation, which is ostensibly a destabilisation of
peeling-ballooning modes. In the case of ELM mitigation, the pedestal
broadening, 3d corrugation or lobes near the X-point degrade ballooning
stability so much that the pedestal recovers rapidly to cross the new stability
boundary at lower pressure more frequently, whilst in the case of suppression,
the plasma parameters are such that the particle transport reduces the edge
pressure below the stability boundary which is only mildly affected by
negligible rotation braking, small edge corrugation or short, broad lobe
structures.

ASDEX Upgrade discharge have been carried out using the reduced MHD code JOREK.
The analysis is focused on the evolution of the toroidal Fourier spectrum. It
is found that during the nonlinear evolution, linearly subdominant low-n
Fourier components, in particular the n = 1, grow to energies comparable with
linearly dominant harmonics. A simple model is developed, based on the idea
that energy is transferred among the toroidal harmonics via second order
nonlinear interaction. The simple model reproduces and explains very well the
early nonlinear evolution of the toroidal spectrum in the JOREK simulations.
Furthermore, it is shown for the n = 1 harmonic, that its spatial structure
changes significantly during the transition from linear to nonlinearly driven
growth. The rigidly growing structure of the linearly barely unstable n = 1
reaches far into the plasma core. In contrast, the nonlinearly driven n = 1 has
a rigidly growing structure localized at the plasma edge, where the dominant
toroidal harmonics driving the n = 1 are maximal and in phase. The presented
quadratic coupling model might explain the recent experimental observation of
strong low-n components in magnetic measurements [Wenninger et al., Non-linear
magnetic perturbations during edge localized modes in TCV dominated by low n
mode components, submitted to Nuclear Fusion].

Starting from a realistic hamiltonian we face the microscopic study of the
excitation phonon-roton spectrum of the system at zero temperature. Our
approach relies on Path Integral Ground State Monte Carlo projection methods,
allowing to evaluate exactly the dynamical density correlation functions in
imaginary time, and this gives access to the dynamical structure factor of the
system S(q,omega), containing information about the excitation spectrum E(q),
resulting in sharp peaks in S(q,omega). The actual evaluation of S(q,omega)
requires the inversion of the Laplace transform in ill-posed conditions, which
we face via the Genetic Inversion via Falsification of Theories technique. We
explore the full density range from the region of spinodal decomposition to the
freezing density, i.e. 0.0321 A^-2 - 0.0658 A^-2. In particular we follow the
density dependence of the excitation spectrum, focusing on the low wave--vector
behavior of E(q), the roton dispersion, the strength of single quasi--particle
peak, Z(q), and the static density response function, chi(q). As the density
increases, the dispersion E(q) at low wave--vector changes from a super-linear
(anomalous dispersion) trend to a sub-linear (normal dispersion) one,
anticipating the crystallization of the system; at the same time the
maxon-roton structure, which is barely visible at low density, becomes well
developed at high densities and the roton wave vector has a strong density
dependence. Connection is made with recent inelastic neutron scattering results
from highly ordered silica nanopores partially filled with 4He.

towards a systematic classification of the complexity of 2-Club with respect to

bipartite by deleting one vertex, on graphs that can be covered by three
cliques, and on graphs with domination number two and diameter three. Then, we
consider the parameter h-index of the input graph. This parameter is motivated
by real-world instances and the fact that 2-Club is fixed-parameter tractable
with respect to the larger parameter maximum degree. We present an algorithm
that solves 2-Club in |V|^{f(k)} time with k being the h-index. By showing
W[1]-hardness for this parameter, we provide evidence that the above algorithm
cannot be improved to a fixed-parameter algorithm. Furthermore, the reduction
used for this hardness result can be modified to show that 2-Club is NP-hard if

\, the path length in the region 0 < V < V_0 is equal to infinity. In this case
the phonon environment follows the charge motion. In the region V > V_0 the
soliton motion is accompanied by emission of phonons which leads to a finite
path length of a soliton. The latter tends to infinity as $V \rightarrow V_0 +

soliton path length. An equilibrium velocity of soliton in an external electric

functions for Gaussian processes using genetic programming. A critical aspect
of Gaussian processes and similar kernel-based models such as SVM is, that the
covariance function should be adapted to the modeled data. Frequently, the
squared exponential covariance function is used as a default. However, this can
lead to a misspecified model, which does not fit the data well. In the proposed
approach we use a grammar for the composition of covariance functions and
genetic programming to search over the space of sentences that can be derived
from the grammar. We tested the proposed approach on synthetic data from
two-dimensional test functions, and on the Mauna Loa CO2 time series. The
results show, that our approach is feasible, finding covariance functions that
perform much better than a default covariance function. For the CO2 data set a
composite covariance function is found, that matches the performance of a
hand-tuned covariance function.

us to place constraints on the spectral types and masses of the putative bound

graph contains a directed spanning tree with the leader node as the root, then
it is possible to place the poles of the ensemble system with purely local
feedback controller gains. Given a desired formation, first one of the poles is
placed at the origin. Then it is shown that the inter-agent weights can be
independently adjusted to assign an eigenvector corresponding to the formation
positions, to the zero eigenvalue. Then, only the leader input is enough to
bring the agents to the desired formation and keep it there with no further
inputs. Moreover, given a formation, the computation of the inter-agent weights
that encode the formation information, can be calculated in a decentralized
fashion using only local information.

coalescences (CBCs) typically requires millions of template waveform
computations at different values of the parameters describing the binary.
Sampling techniques such as Markov chain Monte Carlo and nested sampling
evaluate likelihoods, and hence compute template waveforms, serially; thus, the
total computational time of the analysis scales linearly with that of template
generation. Here we address the issue of rapidly computing the likelihood
function of CBC sources with non-spinning components. We show how to
efficiently compute the continuous likelihood function on the three-dimensional
subspace of parameters on which it has a non-trivial dependence (the chirp
mass, symmetric mass ratio and coalescence time) via interpolation.
Subsequently, sampling this interpolated likelihood function is a significantly
cheaper computational process than directly evaluating the likelihood; we
report improvements in computational time of two to three orders of magnitude
while keeping likelihoods accurate to < 0.025 %. Generating the interpolant of
the likelihood function over a significant portion of the CBC mass space is
computationally expensive but highly parallelizable, so the wall time can be
very small relative to the time of a full parameter-estimation analysis.

due to its simplicity and speed. In this paper, we propose a modification that
speeds up the convergence of the randomized Kaczmarz algorithm for systems of
linear equations with sparse solutions. The speedup is achieved by projecting
every iterate onto a weighted row of the linear system while maintaining the
random row selection criteria of Strohmer and Vershynin. The weights are chosen
to attenuate the contribution of row elements that lie outside of the estimated
support of the sparse solution. While the Kaczmarz algorithm and its variants
can only find solutions to overdetermined linear systems, our algorithm
surprisingly succeeds in finding sparse solutions to underdetermined linear
systems as well. We present empirical studies which demonstrate the
acceleration in convergence to the sparse solution using this modified approach
in the overdetermined case. We also demonstrate the sparse recovery
capabilities of our approach in the underdetermined case and compare the
performance with that of $\ell_1$ minimization.

as filler material leading to a simultaneous improvement of the electrical and

Rev. Lett. 112, 151101 (2014)], we introduced a new scenario that explains the
existence of rapidly rotating warm neutron stars (NSs) observed in low-mass
X-ray binaries (LMXBs). Here it is described in more detail. The scenario takes
into account the interaction between superfluid inertial modes and the normal
(quadrupole) $m=2$ $r$-mode, which can be driven unstable by
Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz (CFS) mechanism. This interaction can only occur
at some fixed ""resonance"" stellar temperatures; it leads to formation of the
""stability peaks"" which stabilize a star in the vicinity of these temperatures.
We demonstrate that a NS in LMXB spends a substantial fraction of time on the
stability peak, that is, in the region of stellar temperatures and spin
frequencies, that has been previously thought to be CFS unstable with respect
to excitation of $r$-modes. We also find that the spin frequencies of NSs are
limited by the CFS instability of normal (octupole) $m=3$ $r$-mode rather than
by $m=2$ $r$-mode. This result agrees with the predicted value of the cutoff
spin frequency $\sim 730$ Hz in the spin distribution of accreting millisecond
X-ray pulsars. In addition, we analyze evolution of a NS after the end of the
accretion phase and demonstrate that millisecond pulsars can be born in LMXBs
within our scenario. Besides millisecond pulsars, our scenario also predicts a
new class of LMXB descendants - hot and rapidly rotating nonaccreting NSs (""hot
widows""/HOFNARs). Further comparison of the proposed theory with observations
of rotating NSs can impose new important constraints on the properties of
superdense matter.

the centers of low-mass galaxies at z<0.3 in the Chandra Deep Field - South
Survey. These black holes are initially identified as candidate active galactic
nuclei based on their X-ray emission in deep Chandra observations.
Multi-wavelength observations are used to strengthen our claim that such
emission is powered by an accreting supermassive black hole. While the X-ray
luminosities are low at L_X ~ 10^40 erg s^-1 (and variable in one case), we
argue that they are unlikely to be attributed to star formation based on
H\alpha or UV-fluxes. Optical spectroscopy with Keck/DEIMOS and VLT/FORS allows
us to (1) measure accurate redshifts, (2) confirm their low stellar host mass,
(3) investigate the source(s) of photo-ionization, and (4) estimate extinction.
With stellar masses of M* < 3*10^9 M_\sun determined from HST/ACS imaging, the
host galaxies are among the lowest mass systems known to host actively
accreting black holes. We estimate BH masses M_BH ~ 2*10^5 M_\sun based on
scaling relations between BH mass and host properties for more luminous
systems. In one case, a broad component of the H\alpha emission-line profile is
detected thus providing a virial mass estimate. Black holes in such low-mass
galaxies are of considerable interest as the low-redshift analogs to the seeds
of the most massive BHs at high redshift which have remained largely elusive to
date. Our study highlights the power of deep X-ray surveys to uncover such
low-mass systems.

almost three orders of magnitude lower than that of bulk Si. Thermal flux in
the modulated nanowires is suppressed by an order of magnitude in comparison
with generic Si nanowires. The effect is explained by modification of the
phonon spectra in modulated nanowires leading to decrease of the phonon group
velocities and localization of certain phonon modes in narrow or wide nanowire
segments. The thermal conductivity inhibition is achieved in nanowires without
additional surface roughness and, thus, potentially reducing degradation of the

Mathematics. It includes the sets as weak $\infty$-groupoids with contractible
connected components, and thereby it includes (much of) the traditional set
theoretical foundations as a special case. We thus wonder whether those
`discrete' groupoids do in fact form a (predicative) topos. More generally,
homotopy type theory is conjectured to be the internal language of `elementary'
$\infty$-toposes. We prove that sets in homotopy type theory form a $\Pi
W$-pretopos. This is similar to the fact that the $0$-truncation of an
$\infty$-topos is a topos. We show that both a subobject classifier and a
$0$-object classifier are available for the type theoretical universe of sets.
However, both of these are large and moreover, the $0$-object classifier for
sets is a function between $1$-types (i.e. groupoids) rather than between sets.
Assuming an impredicative propositional resizing rule we may render the
subobject classifier small and then we actually obtain a topos of sets.

points in opposite directions in the asymptotic past and future. The first
scenario, suggested by Aguirre and Gratton, assumes that the two asymptotic
regions are separated by a de Sitter-like bounce, with low-entropy boundary
conditions imposed at the bounce. Such boundary conditions naturally arise from
quantum cosmology with Hartle-Hawking wave function of the universe. The bounce
hypersurface breaks de Sitter invariance and represents the beginning of the
universe in this model. The second scenario, proposed by Carroll and Chen,
assumes some generic initial conditions on an infinite spacelike Cauchy
surface. They argue that the resulting spacetime will be non-singular, apart
from black holes that could be formed as the initial data is evolved, and will
exhibit eternal inflation in both time directions. Here I show, assuming the
null convergence condition, that the Cauchy surface in a non-singular (apart
from black holes) universe with two asymptotically inflating regions must
necessarily be compact. I also argue that the size of the universe at the
bounce between the two asymptotic regions cannot much exceed the de Sitter
horizon. The spacetime structure is then very similar to that in the
Aguirre-Gratton scenario and does require special boundary conditions at the
bounce. If cosmological singularities are allowed, then an infinite Cauchy
surface with `random' initial data will generally produce inflating regions in
both time directions. These regions, however, will be surrounded by
singularities and will have singularities in their past or future.

hydrodynamic flow through the nanopore due to an asymmetry induced by the

incorporate both minimal and non-minimal couplings. The minimal coupling
reflects the fact that the \Delta+ is a charged particle, and in this model the
minimal coupling contributes also to the M1 magnetic transition via the \gamma
N\Delta vertex. The non-minimal couplings consist of five electromagnetic
form-factors, which are accessed at fixed and vanishing momentum-transfer
squared with real photons in Compton scattering experiments, therefore it is
possible to extract a rather well-determined set of optimal parameters which
reasonably well fit the data in the resonance region 140-450 MeV. The crucial
parameter which determines the \gamma N\Delta transition amplitude and
therefore the height of the resonance peak is equal to 3.66 +- 0.03, in units
of \mu_N. We find that this parameter also primarily determines the
contributions to magnetic polarizability in this model. In the low-energy
region up to 140 MeV, we separately fit the electric and magnetic

an initial universe set with a fixed set of parameters. Later we study soft
open and soft closed mappings, soft homeomorphism and investigate some
properties of these concepts.

  arXiv:1303.5366",,,,"math.RA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","  We give Gr\""obner-Shirshov bases for Drinfeld-Kohno Lie algebra
$\textbf{L}_{n}$ in \cite{[Et]} and Kukin Lie algebra $A_P$ in \cite{Kukin},
where $P$ is a semigroup. As applications, we show that as $\mathbb{Z}$-module
$\textbf{L}_{n}$ is free and a $\mathbb{Z}$-basis of $\textbf{L}_{n}$ is given.
We give another proof of Kukin Theorem: if semigroup $P$ has the undecidable
word problem then the Lie algebra $A_P$ has the same property.

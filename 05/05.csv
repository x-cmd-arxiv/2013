observations of thermally emitting isolated neutron stars and accreting neutron
stars in binary systems. An important ingredient for such an analysis is the
age of the object, which, typically, is obtained from the spin-down history.
This age is highly uncertain if the object's magnetic field varies appreciably
over time. Other age estimators, such as supernova remnant ages and kinematic
ages, only apply to few handful of neutron stars. We conduct a population
synthesis study of the nearby isolated thermal emitters and obtain their ages
statistically from the observed luminosity function of these objects. We argue
that a more sensitive blind scan of the galactic disk with the upcoming space
telescopes can help to constrain the ages to higher accuracy.

redshift space distortions from angular auto-correlations of galaxies in
photometric redshift bins. In this work we extend this idea to include as
observables the cross-correlations between redshift bins, as an additional way
of measuring radial information. We show that this extra information allows to
reduce the recovered error in the growth rate index \gamma by a factor of ~2.
Although the final error in \gamma depends on the bias and the mean photometric
accuracy of the galaxy sample, the improvement from adding cross-correlations
is robust in different settings. Another factor of 2-3 improvement in the
determination of \gamma can be achieved by considering two galaxy populations
over the same photometric sky area but with different biases. This additional
gain is shown to be much larger than the one from the same populations when
observed over different areas of the sky (with twice the combined area). The
total improvement of ~5 implies that a photometric survey such as the Dark
Energy Survey should be able to recover \gamma at the 5-10% from the angular
clustering in linear scales of two different tracers. It can also constrain the
evolution of f(z)x\sigma_8(z) in few bins beyond z~0.8-0.9 at the 10-15% level
per-bin, compatible with recent constrains from lower-z spectroscopic surveys.
We also show how further improvement can be achieved by reducing the

  Math. Stud., 10, Janos Bolyai Math. Soc., Budapest, 2002",,,,"math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  How much dependence is there in the prime factorization of a random integer
distributed uniformly from 1 to n? How much dependence is there in the
decomposition into cycles of a random permutation of n points? What is the
relation between the Poisson-Dirichlet process and the scale invariant Poisson
process? These three questions have essentially the same answers, with respect
to total variation distance, considering only small components, and with
respect to a Wasserstein distance, considering all components. The Wasserstein
distance is the expected number of changes -- insertions and deletions --
needed to change the dependent system into an independent system.
  In particular we show that for primes, roughly speaking, 2+o(1) changes are
necessary and sufficient to convert a uniformly distributed random integer from
1 to n into a random integer prod_{p leq n} p^{Z_p} in which the multiplicity
Z_p of the factor p is geometrically distributed, with all Z_p independent. The
changes are, with probability tending to 1, one deletion, together with a
random number of insertions, having expectation 1+o(1).
  The crucial tool for showing that 2+epsilon suffices is a coupling of the
infinite independent model of prime multiplicities, with the scale invariant
Poisson process on (0,infty). A corollary of this construction is the first
metric bound on the distance to the Poisson-Dirichlet in Billingsley's 1972
weak convergence result. Our bound takes the form: there are couplings in which
  E sum |log P_i(n) - (log n) V_i | = O(\log \log n), where P_i denotes the
i-th largest prime factor and V_i denotes the i-th component of the
Poisson-Dirichlet process. It is reasonable to conjecture that O(1) is
achievable.

analytical model that assumes that the shape of the core does not change during
the hysteresis cycle, known as the rigid core model, to calculate the
annihilation fields. In both cases we found that the annihilation fields
decrease with increasing perpendicular anisotropy for almost all the structures
investigated. The simulations show that for increasing anisotropy or dot
thickness, or both, the vortex core profile changes its shape, becoming
elongated. For every dot thickness, this change does not depend on the dot
radius, but on the relative distance of the core from the center of the dot.

along the sightline and ${\rm T_B}$ is the measured brightness temperature. We
have used a Monte Carlo simulation to quantify the accuracy of the isothermal
estimate by comparing the derived $N_{\rm HI,ISO}$ with the true HI column
density $N_{\rm HI}$. The simulation was carried out for a wide range of
sightlines, including gas in different temperature phases and random locations
along the path. We find that the results are statistically insensitive to the
assumed gas temperature distribution and the positions of different phases
along the line of sight. The median value of the ratio of the true H{\sc i}
column density to the isothermal estimate, $N_{\rm HI}/{N_{\rm HI, ISO}}$, is
within a factor of 2 of unity while the 68.2% confidence intervals are within a
factor of $\approx 3$ of unity, out to high HI column densities, $\le 5 \times
10^{23}$\,cm$^{-2}$ per 1 km s$^{-1}$ channel, and high total optical depths,
$\le 1000$. The isothermal estimator thus provides a significantly better
measure of the HI column density than other methods, within a factor of a few
of the true value even at the highest columns, and should allow us to directly
probe the existence of high HI column density gas in the Milky Way.

the surface of Vesta provides important constraints on its petrologic

howardite-eucrite-diogenite (HED) meteorites. Using color parameters (band tilt
and band curvature) originally developed for analyzing lunar data, we have
identified and mapped HED terrains on Vesta in Dawn Framing Camera (FC) color
data. The average color spectrum of Vesta is identical to that of howardite
regions, suggesting an extensive mixing of surface regolith due to impact
gardening over the course of solar system history. Our results confirm the
hemispherical dichotomy (east-west and north-south) in albedo/color/composition
that has been observed by earlier studies. The presence of diogenite-rich
material in the southern hemisphere suggests that it was excavated during the
formation of the Rheasilvia and Veneneia basins. Our lithologic mapping of HED

the third-party femtocells based on the traffic demands, interference and

non-convex, the algorithm uses a computationally efficient method for finding

observations. A model, making a minimum of assumptions, is introduced that
suggests two-state behavior is likely for any system with an overwhelmingly
populated native state. We show two-state folding is emergent and strengthened
by increasing the occupancy population of the native state. Further, the model
exhibits a hub-like behavior, with slow interconversions between unfolded
states. Despite this, the unfolded state equilibrates quickly relative to the
folding time. This apparent paradox is readily understood through this model.
Finally, our results compare favorable with experimental measurements of

is presented. Decoherence dynamics can be put in evidence by means of
refocusing experiments of the dipolar interactions. The experimental technique
used in this work is based on the MREV8 pulse sequence. The aim of the work is
to detect the main features of the Irreversible Quantum Decoherence (IQD) in
LC, on the basis of the theory presented by the authors recently. The focus is
laid on experimentally probing the eigen-selection process in the intermediate
time scale, between quantum interference of a closed system and thermalization,
as a signature of the IQD of the open quantum system, as well as on quantifying
the effects of non-idealities as possible sources of signal decays which could
mask the intrinsic IQD. In order to contrast experiment and theory, the theory
was adapted to obtain the IQD function corresponding to the MREV8 reversion
experiments. Non-idealities of the experimental setting are analysed in detail
within this framework and their effects on the observed signal decay are
numerically estimated. It is found that, though these non-idealities could in
principle affect the evolution of the spin dynamics, their influence can be
mitigated and they do not present the characteristic behavior of the IQD. As
unique characteristic of the IQD, the experimental results clearly show the
occurrence of eigen-selectivity in the intermediate timescale, in complete
agreement with the theoretical predictions. We conclude that the
eigen-selection effect is the fingerprint of IQD associated with a quantum open
spin system in LC. Besides, these features of the results account for the
quasi-equilibrium states of the spin system, which were observed previously in
these mesophases, and lead to conclude that the quasi-equilibrium is a definite
stage of the spin dynamics during its evolution towards equilibrium

supernova explosions into the gas from which further stars form. Observations

the full history of star formation in the universe, while simulations appear

explore a systematic optimization approach of PSS under large disturbance of
HPS, where its nonlinear features cannot be ignored, which, however, the
traditional eigenvalue-based small signal optimizations do neglect the higher
order terms of Taylor series of the system state equations. In contrast to
previous work, the proposed TS optimal method focuses on the gradient
information of objective function with respect to decision variables by means
of the trajectory sensitivity of HPS to the PSS parameters, and optimizes the
PSS parameters in terms of the conjugate gradient method. Firstly, the
traditional parametric tuning methods of PSS are introduced. Then, the
systematic mathematical models and transient trajectory simulation are
presented by introducing switching/reset events in terms of triggering
hypersurfaces so as to formulate the optimization problem using TS analysis.
Finally, a case study of IEEE three-machine-nine-bus standard test system is

using the cumulative distribution of the number of sources detected at a given
sensitivity. The resulting ""$\log(N>S)$-$\log (S)$"" relationship can be used to
compare and evaluate theoretical models for source populations and their
evolution. Under restrictive assumptions the relationship should be linear. In
practice, however, when simple theoretical models fail, it is common for
astrophysicists to use prespecified piecewise linear models. This paper
proposes a methodology for estimating both the number and locations of
""breakpoints"" in astrophysical source populations that extends beyond existing
work in this field. An important component of the proposed methodology is a new
interwoven EM algorithm that computes parameter estimates. It is shown that in
simple settings such estimates are asymptotically consistent despite the

demonstrated that the proposed methodology is capable of accurately detecting
structural breaks in a variety of parameter configurations. This paper
concludes with an application of our methodology to the Chandra Deep Field

detailed numerical simulations according to the core-nucleated giant planet
accretion scenario. The objects, with heavy-element cores in the range 5-30
Mearth, are assumed to accrete gas up to final masses of 10-15 Jupiter masses
(Mjup). After the formation process, which lasts 1-5 Myr and which ends with a
'cold-start', low-entropy configuration, the bodies evolve at constant mass up
to an age of several Gyr. Deuterium burning via proton capture is included in
the calculation, and we determined the mass, M50, above which more than 50% of
the initial deuterium is burned. This often-quoted borderline between giant
planets and brown dwarfs is found to depend only slightly on parameters, such
as core mass, stellar mass, formation location, solid surface density in the
protoplanetary disk, disk viscosity, and dust opacity. The values for M50 fall
in the range 11.6-13.6 Mjup, in agreement with previous determinations that do
not take the formation process into account. For a given opacity law during the
formation process, objects with higher core masses form more quickly. The
result is higher entropy in the envelope at the completion of accretion,
yielding lower values of M50. For masses above M50, during the
deuterium-burning phase, objects expand and increase in luminosity by 1 to 3
orders of magnitude. Evolutionary tracks in the luminosity-versus-time diagram
are compared with the observed position of the companion to Beta Pictoris.

dynamics challenge our understanding of the fundamental physics processes that
take place in the extreme conditions within the nearly singular region where
material failure occurs. Here, we first briefly review the classic approach to
dynamic fracture, ""Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics"" (LEFM), and discuss its
successes and limitations. We show how, on the one hand, recent experiments
performed on straight cracks propagating in soft brittle materials have
quantitatively confirmed the predictions of this theory to an unprecedented

singular region at the tip of a crack is approached. This breakdown naturally
leads to a new theoretical framework coined ""Weakly Nonlinear Fracture
Mechanics"", where weak elastic nonlinearities are incorporated. The stronger
singularity predicted by this theory gives rise to a new and intrinsic length
scale, $\ell_{nl}$. These predictions are verified in detail through direct
measurements. We then theoretically and experimentally review how the emergence
of $\ell_{nl}$ is linked to a new equation for crack motion, which predicts the
existence of a high-speed oscillatory crack instability whose wave-length is

to improve the performance of original k-nearest neighbour (KNN) classification

optimal number of neighbours, $k$. The contribution of this paper is to
incorporate the uncertainty in $k$ into the decision making, and in so doing
use Bayesian model averaging to provide improved classification. Indeed the
problem of assessing the uncertainty in $k$ can be viewed as one of statistical
model selection which is one of the most important technical issues in the
statistics and machine learning domain. In this paper, a new functional
approximation algorithm is proposed to reconstruct the density of the model

this algorithm avoids cross validation by adopting Bayesian framework. The
performance of this algorithm yielded very good performance on several real

\geq 3$, $q>p-1$ with $p \in (1,2]$ and $a \in (-n,0]$. The positive weak
solution $u$ of the quasilinear PDE is $\mathcal{A}$-superharmonic and
satisfies $\inf_{R^n}u=0$. We can introduce an integral equation involving the
wolff potential $$ u(x)=R(x) W_{\beta,p}(|y|^au^q(y))(x), \quad u>0 \quad

When $0<q \leq \frac{(n+a)(p-1)}{n-p\beta}$, there does not exist any positive
solution to this integral equation. When $q>\frac{(n+a)(p-1)}{n-p\beta}$, the
positive solution $u$ of the integral equation is bounded and decays with the
fast rate $\frac{n-p\beta}{p-1}$ if and only if it is integrable (i.e. it
belongs to $L^{\frac{n(q-p+1)}{p\beta+a}}(R^n)$). On the other hand, if the
bounded solution is not integrable and decays with some rate, then the rate
must be the slow one $\frac{p\beta+a}{q-p+1}$. Thus, all the properties above
are still true for the quasilinear PDE. Finally, several qualitative properties
for this PDE are discussed.

($ii$) the vibrational properties of materials with spatially fluctuating
elastic coefficients in topologically disordered materials. The effective
medium in the present version of the CPA is not a lattice but a homogeneous and
isotropic medium, representing an amorphous material on a mesoscopic scale. The
transition from a frequency-independent to a frequency-dependent diffusivity
(conductivity) is shown to correspond to the boson peak in the vibrational
model. The anomalous regimes above the crossover are governed by a complex,
frequency-dependent self energy. The boson peak is shown to be stronger for
non-Gaussian disorder than for Gaussian disorder. We demonstrate that the
low-frequency non-analyticity of the off-lattice version of the CPA leads to
the correct long-time tails of the velocity autocorrelation function in the
hopping problem and to low-frequency Rayleigh scattering in the wave problem.
Furthermore we show that the present version of the CPA is capable to treat the
percolative aspects of hopping transport adequately.

machine learning and signal processing. Deep learning is one of the most
effective unsupervised representation learning approach. The main contributions
of this paper to the topics are as follows. (i) We propose to view the
representative deep learning approaches as special cases of the knowledge reuse
framework of clustering ensemble. (ii) We propose to view sparse coding when
used as a feature encoder as the consensus function of clustering ensemble, and
view dictionary learning as the training process of the base clusterings of
clustering ensemble. (ii) Based on the above two views, we propose a very
simple deep learning algorithm, named deep random model ensemble (DRME). It is
a stack of random model ensembles. Each random model ensemble is a special
k-means ensemble that discards the expectation-maximization optimization of
each base k-means but only preserves the default initialization method of the
base k-means. (iv) We propose to select the most powerful representation among
the layers by applying DRME to clustering where the single-linkage is used as
the clustering algorithm. Moreover, the DRME based clustering can also detect
the number of the natural clusters accurately. Extensive experimental
comparisons with 5 representation learning methods on 19 benchmark data sets
demonstrate the effectiveness of DRME.

years Shannon's theory has been generalized to the quantum setting to let the
\emph{quantum information theory} step in. In this paper we consider the
classical capacity of quantum channels with restricted assisted entanglement.
In particular these capacities include the classical capacity and the unlimited
entanglement-assisted classical capacity of a quantum channel. To deal with the
quantum case we will use the noncommutative version of $p$-summing maps. More
precisely, we prove that the (product state) classical capacity of a quantum
channel with restricted assisted entanglement can be expressed as the
derivative of a completely $p$-summing norm.

accretion flow is blown away by radiation force, thus forming outflows,
however, the properties of such radiation-driven outflows have been poorly
understood. We have performed global two-dimensional
radiaion-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of supercritical accretion flow onto a
black hole with 10 or 10^8 solar masses in a large simulation box of 514 r_S x
514 r_S (with r_S being the Schwarzschild radius). We confirm that uncollimated
outflows with velocities of 10 percents of the speed of light emerge from the
innermost part of the accretion flow over wide angles of 10 - 50 degree from
the disk rotation axis. Importantly, the outflows exhibit clumpy structure
above heights of ~ 250 r_S. The typical size of the clumps is ~ 10 r_S, which
corresponds to one optical depth, and their shapes are slightly elongated along
the outflow direction. Since clumps start to form in the layer above which
(upward) radiation force overcomes (downward) gravity force, Rayleigh-Taylor
instability seems to be of primary cause. In addition, a radiation hydrodynamic
instability, which arises when radiation funnels through radiation-pressure
supported atmosphere, may also help forming clumps of one optical depth.
Magnetic photon bubble instability seems not to be essential, since similar
clumpy outflow structure is obtained in non-magnetic radiation-hydrodynamic
simulations. Since the spatial covering factor of the clumps is estimated to be
~ 0.3 and since they are marginally optically thick, they will explain at least
some of rapid light variations of active galactic nuclei. We further discuss a
possibility of producing broad-line clouds by the clumpy outflow.

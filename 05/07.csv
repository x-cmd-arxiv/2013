distance relationship between atoms of a protein. Each cell (i, j) of a protein
contact map states whether the atoms (nodes) i and j are within some Euclidean
distance from each other. We examined the radius one Moore neighborhood
surrounding each cell (i, j) where j > (i + 2) in complete protein contact maps
by mutating them one at a time. We found that the particular configuration of a
neighborhood is generally (97%) optimal in the sense that no other
configuration could maintain or improve upon existing local and global
efficiencies of the nodes residing in a neighborhood. Local efficiency of a
node is directly related to its clustering measure. Global efficiency of a node
is inversely related to its distance to other nodes in the network. This
feature of the Moore neighborhood in complete protein contact maps may explain
how protein residue networks are able to form long-range links to reduce
average path length while maintaining a high level of clustering throughout the
process of small-world formation, and could suggest new approaches to protein
contact map prediction. Effectively, the problem of protein contact map
prediction is transformed to one of maximizing the number of optimal
neighborhoods. By comparison, Moore neighborhoods in protein contact maps with
randomized long-range links are less optimal.

previous similar ones. The advantage of this treatment is that the information

and many applications such as imaging, the calculation of line profiles or the
observer-emitter problem, etc become root finding problems. All elliptic
integrations are computed by Carlson's elliptic integral method as

code. The formulae to compute the constants of motion given by
\cite{cunnbard1973} have been extended, which allow one readily to handle the
situations, in which the emitter or the observer has arbitrary distance and
motion state with respect to the central compact object. The validation of the
code has been extensively tested by its application to toy problems from the
literature. The source FORTRAN code is freely available for download on the

DC magnetic field B. We focus on effects in \epsilon(\omega) due to interband
transitions (IBTs), which are important in the blue and ultraviolet for noble
metals used in plasmonics. The dielectric function is found using the
perturbation of the electron density matrix due to the optical field of
incident electromagnetic radiation. The calculation is applied to transitions
between two bands (d and p, for example) separated by a gap, as one finds in
gold at the L-point of the Fermi surface. The result of the DC magnetic field
is a shift in the effective optical frequency causing IBTs by $\pm \mu_B B /
\hbar$, where opposite signs are associated with left/right circular
polarizations. Faraday rotation for a dilute solution of 17 nm diameter gold
nanoparticles is measured and compared with both the IBT theory and a simpler
Drude model for the bound electron response. Effects of the plasmon resonance
mode on Faraday rotation in nanoparticles are also discussed.

enlarged gauge group $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}$ where automatic
inclusion of right handed fermions as $SU(2)_R$ doublets guarantees a natural
seesaw origin of neutrino masses. Apart from the extended gauge symmetry, LRSM
also has an in-built global discrete symmetry, called D-parity which ensures
equal gauge couplings for left and right sectors. Motivated by the fact that
global symmetries are expected to be explicitly broken by theories of quantum
gravity, here we study the effects of such gravity or Planck scale physics on
neutrino masses and mixings by introducing explict D-parity breaking Planck
scale suppressed higher dimensional operators. Although such Planck scale
suppressd operators have dimension at least six in generic LRSM, dimension five
operators can also arise in the presence of additional scalar fields which can
be naturally accommodated within SO(10) grand unified theory (GUT) multiplets.
We show that, such corrections can give rise to significant changes in the
predictions for neutrino mixing parameters from the ones predicted by tree
level seesaw formula if the left right symmetry breaking scale is lower than
$10^{14}$ GeV.

recent study (paper I) to a truly bipolar setup. We perform axisymmetric MHD
simulations of the disk-jet interaction on a computational domain covering both
hemispheres, in particular addressing the question of an intrinsically
asymmetric origin of jet / counter jet systems. Treating both hemispheres
simultaneously, we overcome the equatorial plane symmetry boundary condition
used in most previous studies which naturally fosters a symmetric evolution.
For the magnetic diffusivity prescription we apply an alpha-parametrisation,
considering both, globally models of diffusivity, and local models. We first
approve the quality of our numerical setup by generating perfectly symmetric
jets, lasting over a 1000s of dynamical time scales. We then disturb the
hemispheric symmetry in the disk, and investigate the subsequent evolution of
the outflow. The evolution first leads to a substantial disk warping with
electric currents intersecting the equatorial plane. We investigate two models,
i) a disk with (initially) different thermal scale height in both hemispheres,
and ii) a symmetric disk into which a local disturbance is injected in one
hemisphere. In both cases the disk asymmetry results in asymmetric outflows
with mass fluxes differing by 10-20%. We find up to 30% difference in mass flux
between jet and counter jet for this setup, lasting over 1000s of dynamical
time scales (i.e. lasting for the whole simulation). In summary, our results
suggest that the jet asymmetries in protostellar and extragalactic jets can
indeed be generated intrinsically and maintained over long time by disk
asymmetries and the standard jet launching mechanism.

anisotropic (CTA), and (2) the transversal manifold is simple. In this paper we
will consider geometries satisfying (1) but not (2). The first main result
states that the boundary measurements uniquely determine a mixed Fourier

decades. Free of bulk disorder within the resolution of powder diffraction
methods, it is thought that this material is a rare realization of a spin glass
resulting from weak disorder such as bond disorder or local lattice
distortions. Here, we report on the single crystal growth of Y2Mo2O7. Using
neutron scattering, we present unique isotropic magnetic diffuse scattering
arising beneath the spin glass transition despite having a well-ordered
structure at the bulk level. Despite our attempts to model the diffuse
scattering using a computationally exhaustive search of a class of simple spin
Hamiltonians, we were unable to replicate the experimentally observed
energy-integrated (diffuse) neutron scattering. A T^2-temperature dependence in
the heat capacity and density functional theory calculations hint at
significant frozen degeneracy in both the spin and orbital degrees of freedom
resulting from spin-orbital coupling (Kugel-Khomskii type) and random
fluctuations in the Mo environment at the local level.

infrared images shows an excellent correspondence between X-rays and 24 and 70

the latter flows, in the static gauge, to a two-dimensional massless free-field
theory. It is known that the Lorentz invariance of the gauge theory fixes
uniquely the first few subleading corrections of this free-field limit. We
point out that the first allowed correction - a quartic polynomial in the field

leaves intact the unperturbed {\mathcal N}^2-fold degeneracy patterns, with

of gravity and drag. Depending on the regime considered, the drag force can
exhibit a linear, quadratic or even more general dependence on the velocity of
the body relative to the fluid. The case of quadratic drag is substantially
more complex than the linear case, as it nonlinearly couples both components of
the momentum equation. Careful screening of the literature on this classical
topic showed that, unexpectedly, the solutions reported do not directly provide
the particle velocity as a function of time but use auxiliary quantities or
apply to special cases only. No explicit solution using elementary operations
on analytical expressions is known for a general trajectory. After a detailed
account of the literature, the paper provides such a solution in form of a
ratio of two series expansions. This result is discussed in detail and related
to previous approaches. In particular, it is shown to yield, as limiting cases,
certain approximate solutions proposed in the literature. The solution
technique employs a strategy to reduce systems of ordinary differential
equations with a triangular dependence of the right-hand side on the vector of
unknowns to a single equation in an auxiliary variable. For the particular case
of quadratic drag, the auxiliary variable allows an interpretation in terms of
canonical coordinates of motion within the framework of Hamiltonian mechanics.
Another result of the paper is the extension of the solution technique to more
general drag laws, such as general power laws or power laws with an additional
linear contribution. Furthermore, generalization to variable velocity of the
surrounding fluid is addressed by considering a linear velocity profile for
which a solution is provided as well. Throughout, the results obtained are
illustrated by numerical examples.

adopt and implement many new laboratory techniques as they arrived on the
scene. Pathologists successfully integrate the results of those tests into
final pathology reports that were, and still are, the basis of clinical
therapeutic decisions. The molecular methods are different but no more
difficult to comprehend in the era of ""kit procedures"". Pathologists have the
knowledge and expertise to identify particular gene mutations using the
appropriate molecular tests currently available. This review focuses on the
most important recent developments in KRAS mutation testing in metastatic
colorectal cancer (CRC), and shows that a pathologist is involved in 10 stages
of this procedure. Recent studies have shown that highly sensitive, simple,
reliable and rapid assays may significantly improve the identification of CRC
patients resistant to anti-EGFR therapy. Thus, direct sequencing does not seem
to be an optimal procedure of KRAS testing for clinical purposes. Twelve
currently available high-sensitivity diagnostic assays (with the CE-IVD mark)
for KRAS mutation testing are briefly described and compared. The suggested
pathology report content for somatic mutation tests is described. In
conclusion, evidence is presented that sending away paraffin blocks with tumor
tissue for KRAS mutation testing may not be in the best interest of patients.
Instead, an evidence-based approach indicates that KRAS mutation testing should
be performed in pathology departments, only with the use of CE-IVD/FDA-approved
KRAS tests, and with the obligatory, periodic participation in the KRAS EQA
scheme organized by the European Society of Pathology as an independent

focusing on the effects that are brought about by the delayed distribution of
goods that accumulate in groups due to the continuous investments of

because of a decelerated invasion of defectors, who are unable to reap the same
high short-term benefits as they do in the absence of delayed distribution.
Long delays, however, introduce a risk because the large accumulated wealth
might fall into the wrong hands. Indeed, as soon as the curvature of a
cooperative cluster turns negative, the engulfed defectors can collect the
heritage of many generations of cooperators, and by doing so start a waning
moon pattern that nullifies the benefits of decelerated invasion. Accidental
meeting points of growing cooperative clusters may also act as triggers for the
waning moon effect, thus linking the success of cooperators with their
propensity to fail in a rather bizarre way. Our results highlight that

very important. However, the high computational cost of the existing geodesic
algorithms means that they are not practical for large-scale models or
time-critical applications. To tackle this challenge, we propose the parallel
Chen-Han (or PCH) algorithm, which extends the classic Chen-Han (CH) discrete
geodesic algorithm to the parallel setting. The original CH algorithm and its
variant both lack a parallel solution because the windows (a key data structure
that carries the shortest distance in the wavefront propagation) are maintained
in a strict order or a tightly coupled manner, which means that only one window
is processed at a time. We propose dividing the CH's sequential algorithm into
four phases, window selection, window propagation, data organization, and
events processing so that there is no data dependence or conflicts in each
phase and the operations within each phase can be carried out in parallel. The
proposed PCH algorithm is able to propagate a large number of windows
simultaneously and independently. We also adopt a simple yet effective strategy
to control the total number of windows. We implement the PCH algorithm on
modern GPUs (such as Nvidia GTX 580) and analyze the performance in detail. The
performance improvement (compared to the sequential algorithms) is highly
consistent with GPU double-precision performance (GFLOPS). Extensive
experiments on real-world models demonstrate an order of magnitude improvement

node the message travels over a link that brings the message closest to the
target w.r.t. the Manhattan distance, finds a path of expected length O(log^2
n) between any two nodes. In this paper we prove that greedy routing does not
perform asymptotically better for any uniform and isotropic augmenting
distribution, i.e., the probability that node u has a particular long range
contact v is independent of the labels of u and v and only a function of
||u-v||.
  In order to obtain the result, we introduce a novel proof technique: We
define a budget game, in which a token travels over a game board, while the
player manages a ""probability budget"". In each round, the player bets part of
her remaining probability budget on step sizes. A step size is chosen at random
according to a probability distribution of the player's bet. The token then
makes progress as determined by the chosen step size, while some of the
player's bet is removed from her probability budget. We prove a tight lower
bound for such a budget game, and then obtain a lower bound for greedy routing
in the D-dimensional grid by a reduction.

O, B, and A stars. At the same time, many theoretical and indirect
observational studies suggested ubiquitous presence of weak localized magnetic
fields at the surfaces of massive stars. However, no direct detections of such
fields have been reported yet. We have carried out the first comprehensive
theoretical investigation of the spectropolarimetric observational signatures
of the structured magnetic fields. These calculations are applied to interpret
null results of the recent magnetic surveys of massive stars. The intensity and
circular polarization spectra of early-type stars are simulated using detailed
polarized radiative transfer calculations with LTE model atmospheres. Similar
to observational analyses, the mean Stokes I and V line profiles are obtained
by applying a multi-line averaging technique. Different spectropolarimetric
observables are examined for multiple realizations of randomly distributed
radial magnetic field spots with different spatial scales. We characterize the
amplitude of the circular polarization profiles and the mean longitudinal
magnetic field as a function of magnetic spot sizes. The dependence of these
observables on the effective temperature, projected rotational velocity, and
inclination angle is also investigated. Using results of the recently completed
Magnetism in Massive Stars (MiMeS) survey, we derive upper limits on the
small-scale magnetic fields compatible with the MiMeS non-detections. According
to our simulations, existing spectropolarimetric observations of sharp-lined
massive stars rule out the presence of the small-scale fields stronger than
50-250 G, depending on the typical spot sizes. For broad-lined stars, the
observations constrain such fields to be below approximately 1 kG.

posterior transit probability depends not only on the prior probability
distribution of i but also on the prior probability distribution of the
companion mass M_c. In general, the posterior can be larger or smaller than the
prior transit probability. We derive analytic expressions for the posterior
transit probability assuming a power-law form for the distribution of true
masses with exponent alpha. For low transit probabilities, these probabilities
reduce to a constant multiplicative factor of the corresponding prior transit
probability. The prior and posterior probabilities are equal for alpha = -1,
whereas the posterior transit probability is ~1.5 times larger and ~4/pi larger
for for alpha = -3 and alpha = -2, but is less than the prior for alpha >= 0,
and can be arbitrarily small for alpha > 1. We also calculate the posterior
transit probability in different mass regimes for two physically-motivated mass
distributions of companions around Sun-like stars, finding that the posterior
is likely higher for Super-Earths, Neptunes and Super-Jupiters. We therefore
suggest that companions with minimum masses in these regimes might be
better-than-expected targets for transit follow-up, and we identify promising

both low- and high-mass regions and for other astrophysical sources from comets
to high-redshift galaxies. However, a major and often overlooked difficulty
with HCN is that it can exhibit non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE)
behaviour in its hyperfine line structure. Individual hyperfine lines can be
strongly boosted or suppressed. In low-mass star-forming cloud observations,
this could possibly lead to large errors in the calculation of opacity and
excitation temperature, while in massive star-forming clouds, where the
hyperfine lines are blended due to turbulent broadening, errors will arise in
infall measurements that are based on the separation of the peaks in a
self-absorbed profile. The underlying line shape cannot be known for certain if
hyperfine anomalies are present. We present a first observational investigation
of these anomalies across a range of conditions and transitions by carrying out
a survey of low-mass starless cores (in Taurus & Ophiuchus) and high-mass
protostellar objects (in the G333 giant molecular cloud) using hydrogen cyanide
(HCN) J=1-0 and J=3-2 emission lines. We quantify the degree of anomaly in
these two rotational levels by considering ratios of individual hyperfine lines
compared to LTE values. We find that all the cores observed show some degree of
anomaly while many of the lines are severely anomalous. We conclude that HCN
hyperfine anomalies are common in both lines in both low-mass and high-mass
protostellar objects, and we discuss the differing hypotheses for the
generation of the anomalies. In light of the results, we favour a line overlap
effect for the origins of the anomalies. We discuss the implications for the
use of HCN as a dynamical tracer and suggest in particular that the J=1-0,
F=0-1 hyperfine line should be avoided in quantitative calculations.

functions in each redshift slice and model the selection effects inherent in
any narrow-band selection statistically, to obviate the retrospective

very low star formation rates (SFRs), and allow an accurate evaluation of the
faint end slope of the Schechter function, alpha. We find that alpha is
particularly sensitive to the assumed faintest broadband magnitude of a galaxy
capable of hosting an emission line, and propose that this limit should be
empirically motivated. For this analysis we base our threshold on the limiting
observed equivalent widths of emission lines in the local Universe. We compute
the characteristic SFR of galaxies in each redshift slice, and the integrated

its conditions of applications so as to include annular maps, that is maps

  The bijective construction presented here relies deeply on the theory of
\alpha-orientations introduced by Felsner, and in particular on the existence
of minimal and accessible orientations. Since most of the families of maps can
be characterized by such orientations, our generic bijective method is proved
to capture as special cases all previously known bijections involving
blossoming trees: for example Eulerian maps, m-Eulerian maps, non separable
maps and simple triangulations and quadrangulations of a k-gon. Moreover, it
also permits to obtain new bijective constructions for bipolar orientations and
d-angulations of girth d of a k-gon.
  As for applications, each specialization of the construction translates into
enumerative by-products, either via a closed formula or via a recursive
computational scheme. Besides, for every family of maps described in the paper,
the construction can be implemented in linear time. It yields thus an effective
way to encode and generate planar maps.
  In a recent work, Bernardi and Fusy introduced another unified bijective
scheme, we adopt here a different strategy which allows us to capture different
bijections. These two approaches should be seen as two complementary ways of
unifying bijections between planar maps and decorated trees.

Supersymmetry, where the sparticles have masses inversely proportional to their
leading-log contributions to the electroweak symmetry breaking scale. Higgsinos
are the lightest supersymmetric particles; top and bottom squarks are the
next-to-lightest sparticles that decay into both neutral and charged Higgsinos
with well-defined branching ratios determined by Yukawa couplings and
kinematics. The Higgsinos are nearly degenerate in mass, once the bino and wino
masses are taken to their natural (heavy) values. We consider three scenarios
for the stop and sbottom masses: (I) $\tilde{t}_R$ is light, (II) $\tilde{t}_L$
and $\tilde{b}_L$ are light, and (III) $\tilde{t}_R$, $\tilde{t}_L$, and
$\tilde{b}_L$ are light. Dedicated stop searches are currently sensitive to
Scenarios II and III, but not Scenario I. Sbottom-motivated searches ($2 b +
\rm{MET}$) impact both squark flavors due to $\tilde{t} \ra b \charp_1$ as well
as $\tilde{b} \ra b \neut_{1,2}$, constraining Scenarios I and III with
somewhat weaker constraints on Scenario II. The totality of these searches
yield relatively strong constraints on Natural Supersymmetry. Two regions that
remain are: (1) the ""compressed wedge"", where $(m_{\tilde{q}} -
|\mu|)/m_{\tilde{q}} \ll 1$, and (2) the ""kinematic limit"" region, where
$m_{\tilde{q}} \gsim 600-750 GeV, at the kinematic limit of the LHC searches.
We calculate the correlated predictions for Higgs physics, demonstrating that
these regions lead to distinct predictions for the lightest Higgs couplings
that are separable with $\simeq 10% measurements. We show that these
conclusions remain largely unchanged once the MSSM is extended to the NMSSM in
order to naturally obtain a large enough mass for the lightest Higgs boson

particular two different determinantal enumerations of these families. These
results are then applied to study the weak Lefschetz property of Artinian

onto a Jupiter-mass planet and the structure of the circumplanetary gas flow
after opening a gap in the disk. We compare our results with simulations of
laminar, yet viscous disks with different levels of an $\alpha$-type viscosity.
In all cases, we find that the accretion flow across the surface of the Hill
sphere of the planet is not spherically or azimuthally symmetric, and is
predominantly restricted to the mid-plane region of the disk. Even in the
turbulent case, we find no significant vertical flow of mass into the Hill
sphere. The outer parts of the circumplanetary disk are shown to rotate
significantly below Keplerian speed, independent of viscosity, while the
circumplanetary disk density (therefore the angular momentum) increases with
viscosity. For a simulation of a magnetized turbulent disk, where the global
averaged alpha stress is $\alpha_{MHD}=10^{-3}$, we find the accretion rate
onto the planet to be $\dot{M}\approx 2\times10^{-6}M_{J}yr^{-1}$ for a gap
surface density of $12 g cm^{-2}$. This is about a third of the accretion rate
obtained in a laminar viscous simulation with equivalent $\alpha$ parameter.

refinement simulation of an overdense region that forms a few 10^9 Msun dark
matter halos and over 13,000 Population III stars by redshift 15. We find that
most halos do not form Population III stars until they reach Mvir ~ 10^7 Msun
because this biased region is quickly enriched from both Population III and
galaxies, which also produce high levels of ultraviolet radiation that suppress
H2 formation. Nevertheless, Population III stars continue to form, albeit in
more massive halos, at a rate of ~ 10^{-4} Msun yr^{-1} Mpc^{-3} at redshift
15. The most massive starless halo has a mass of 7 x 10^7 Msun, which could
host massive black hole formation through the direct gaseous collapse scenario.
We show that the multiplicity of the Population III remnants grows with halo
mass above 10^8 Msun, culminating in 50 remnants located in 10^9 Msun halos on

the key theoretical differences between the two setups to location and number
of active surface states, we describe both setups within the same framework of
spin diffusion of the non-equilibrium spin density of the topological surface
states. For the TI/FM bilayer, we find large spin-torque efficiencies of
roughly equal magnitude for both in-plane and out-of-plane spin torques. For
the TI/mdTI bilayer, we elucidate the dominance of the spin-transfer-like
torque. However, we cannot explain the orders of magnitude enhancement

  (1). X is a K3 fibration over a curve. We study the Donaldson-Thomas
invariants of the 2 dimensional Gieseker stable sheaves in X supported on the
fibers. Analogous to the Gromov-Witten theory formula established in the work
of Maulik-Pandharipande, we express these invariants in terms of the Euler
characteristic of the Hilbert scheme of points on the K3 surface and the
Noether-Lefschetz numbers of the fibration, and prove that the invariants have
modular properties.
  (2). X is the total space of the canonical bundle of P^2. We study the
generalized Donaldson-Thomas invariants defined by Joyce-Song of the moduli
spaces of the 2-dimensional Gieseker semistable sheaves on X with first Chern
class equal to k times the class of the zero section of X. When k=1,2 or 3, and
semistability implies stability, we express the invariants in terms of known
modular forms. We prove a combinatorial formula for the invariants when k=2 in
the presence of the strictly semistable sheaves, and verify the BPS integrality
conjecture of Joyce-Song in some cases.
  (3). (Joint with Richard Thomas) X is a Calabi-Yau threefold and L is a
sufficiently positive line bundle. We define new invariants counting a
restricted class of 2-dimensional torsion sheaves, enumerating pairs (Z,H) in X
where H is a member of the linear system |L| and Z is a 1-dimensional subscheme
of H. The associated sheaf is the ideal sheaf of Z in H, pushed forward to X

Therefore, we expect the GCSs of isolated elliptical galaxies to be poor.
Alhough not completely isolated, NGC 7507 is a massive field elliptical galaxy
with an apparently very low dark matter content. Aims: We determine the
richness, the colour distribution, and the structural properties of the GCS of
NGC 7507. Methods: We perform wide-field Washington photometry with data
obtained with the MOSAIC II camera at the 4m-Blanco telescope, CTIO. Results:
The GCS is very poor with S_N ~ 0.6. We identify three subpopulations with
peaks at (C-T1) colours of 1.21, 1.42, and 1.72. The bluest population may
represent the old, metal-poor component. This interpretation is supported by
its shallow density profile. The red population is more concentrated,
resembling the galaxy light. The intermediate-colour population is strongly
peaked in colour and we interpret this population as the signature of a
starburst, whose age depends on the metallicity, but should be quite old, since
no signatures of a merger are identifiable. In addition, we find a main
sequence in the stellar foreground population, which we attribute to the
Sagittarius dwarf tidal stream. Conclusions: The extraordinarily poor GCS of
NGC 7507, a massive elliptical galaxy, is an illustration of how important the
environmental conditions are for producing rich GCSs.

assess the reliability of the model recovery, and of parameters estimation. We
conclude that the model and parameters are properly recovered only under

N-partite quantum state. Intuitively, we say that the multipartite state
""joins"" the underlying correlations. Determining whether, for a given set of
states and a given joining structure, a compatible N-partite quantum state
exists is known as the quantum marginal problem. We restrict to bipartite
reduced states that belong to the paradigmatic classes of Werner and isotropic
states in d dimensions, and focus on two specific versions of the quantum
marginal problem which we find to be tractable. The first is Alice-Bob,
Alice-Charlie joining, with both pairs being in a Werner or isotropic state.
The second is m-n sharability of a Werner state across N subsystems, which may
be seen as a variant of the N-representability problem to the case where
subsystems are partitioned into two groupings of m and n parties, respectively.
By exploiting the symmetry properties that each class of states enjoys, we
determine necessary and sufficient conditions for three-party joinability and
1-n sharability for arbitrary d. Our results explicitly show that although
entanglement is required for sharing limitations to emerge, correlations beyond
entanglement generally suffice to restrict joinability, and not all unentangled
states necessarily obey the same limitations. The relationship between
joinability and quantum cloning as well as implications for the joinability of
arbitrary bipartite states are discussed.

the logarithmic transformation is a reasonable choice to convert

approximation factor arbitrarily close to $1/\rho$. Hence, even for such

performed using the Born-von-Karman model for the intra-layer atomic

It was found that the stacking order affects the out-of-plane acoustic phonon
modes the most. The difference in the phonon densities of states in the twisted
bilayer graphene and in AA- or AB-stacked bilayer graphene appears in the
phonon frequencies range 90 - 110 1/cm. Twisting bilayer graphene leads to
emergence of new phonon branches - termed entangled phonons - which originate
from mixing of phonon modes from different high-symmetry directions in the
Brillouin zone. The frequencies of the entangled phonon depend strongly on the
rotation angle and can be used for non-contact identification of the twist
angles in graphene samples. The obtained results and tabulated frequencies of
phonons in twisted bilayer graphene are important for interpretation of
experimental Raman data and determining thermal conductivity of these materials

and $(X_D)$ be its exit measures indexed by sub-domains of $E$. The
relationship between the equation $1/2 \Delta u=2 u^2$ and Super-Brownian
motion (SBM) is analogous to the relationship between Brownian motion and the
Laplace's equation, and substantial progress has been made on the study of the
solutions of this semi-linear p.d.e. exploring this analogy. An area that
remains to be explored is Martin boundary theory. Martin boundary in the
semi-linear case is defined as the convex set of extreme $X$-harmonic functions
which are functions on the space of finite measures supported in a domain $E$
of $R^d$ and characterized by a mean value property with respect to the
Super-Brownian law. So far no probabilistic construction of Martin boundary is
known.
  In this paper, we consider a bounded smooth domain $D$, and we investigate
exit densities of SBM, a certain family of $X$ harmonic functions, $H^{\nu}$,
indexed by finite measures $\nu$ on $\partial{D}$, These densities were first
introduced by E.B. Dynkin and also identified by T.Salisbury and D. Sezer as
the extended X-harmonic functions corresponding to conditioning SBM on its exit
measure $X_D$ being equal to $\nu$. $H^{\nu}(\mu)$ can be thought as the
analogue of the Poisson kernel for Brownian motion. It is well known that
Poisson kernel for a smooth domain $D$ is equivalent to the so called Martin
kernel, the class of extreme harmonic functions for $D$. We show that a similar
result is true for Super-Brownian motion as well, that is $H^{\nu}$ is extreme
for almost all $\nu$ with respect to a certain measure.

changes with the movement of the rotary table along X-ray direction. In order
to realize the automatic calibration of the voxel size, a new

distance from its nominal zero position and the voxel size. Finally, the linear
equation is imported into the calibration module of the 3D-CT scanning system,

of the voxel size is dynamically exported. The experimental results prove that

to obtain near ultraviolet imaging of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field using the
Wide Field Camera 3 UVIS detector with the F225W, F275W, and F336W filters.
This survey is designed to: (i) Investigate the episode of peak star formation
activity in galaxies at 1<z<2.5; (ii) Probe the evolution of massive galaxies
by resolving sub-galactic units (clumps); (iii) Examine the escape fraction of
ionizing radiation from galaxies at z~2-3; (iv) Greatly improve the reliability
of photometric redshift estimates; and (v) Measure the star formation rate
efficiency of neutral atomic-dominated hydrogen gas at z~1-3. In this overview
paper, we describe the survey details and data reduction challenges, including
both the necessity of specialized calibrations and the effects of charge
transfer inefficiency. We provide a stark demonstration of the effects of
charge transfer inefficiency on resultant data products, which when
uncorrected, result in uncertain photometry, elongation of morphology in the
readout direction, and loss of faint sources far from the readout. We agree
with the STScI recommendation that future UVIS observations that require very
sensitive measurements use the instrument's capability to add background light
through a ""post-flash"". Preliminary results on number counts of UV-selected
galaxies and morphology of galaxies at z~1 are presented. We find that the
number density of UV dropouts at redshifts 1.7, 2.1, and 2.7 is largely
consistent with the number predicted by published luminosity functions. We also
confirm that the image mosaics have sufficient sensitivity and resolution to
support the analysis of the evolution of star-forming clumps, reaching 28-29th
magnitude depth at 5 sigma in a 0.2 arcsecond radius aperture depending on
filter and observing epoch.

the {\em optimal} algorithms for obtaining the best possible regret and payoff
functions for this problem. The question turns out to be also equivalent to the
problem of optimal trade-offs between the regrets of two experts in an ""experts
problem"", studied before by \cite{kearns-regret}. While, say, a regret of
$\Theta(\sqrt{T})$ is known, we argue that it important to ask what is the
provably optimal algorithm for this problem --- both because it leads to
natural algorithms, as well as because regret is in fact often comparable in
magnitude to the final payoffs and hence is a non-negligible term.
  In the basic setting, the result essentially follows from a classical result
of Cover from '65. Here instead, we focus on another standard setting, of
time-discounted payoffs, where the final ""stopping time"" is not specified. We
exhibit an explicit characterization of the optimal regret for this setting.
  To obtain our main result, we show that the optimal payoff functions have to
satisfy the Hermite differential equation, and hence are given by the solutions
to this equation. It turns out that characterization of the payoff function is
qualitatively different from the classical (non-discounted) setting, and,
namely, there's essentially a unique optimal solution.

for the pressure-induced mode-coupling behaviors reported by Sood et al. [Phys.
Rev. B 51, 8892 (1995)]. As pressure is applied further beyond ~ 50 GPa to the
cubic PE phase, the lowest F1u mode softens again and diverges into two
separate modes of tetragonal FE P4mm at above ~ 150 GPa. These phonon-branching
behaviors at high pressures provide a clear re-confirmation of the re-entrant
ferroelectricity predicted in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 196804 (2005); Phys. Rev. B
74, 180101 (2006); ibid. 85, 054108 (2012)]. The high-pressure-re-entrant FE
polarization was not found in the rhombohedral structure. Instead, the
centosymmetric R-3m phase was favored at above ~ 30 GPa. The phonon modes
calculated for the phonon-propagation vectors in the high-symmetry directions
show that the Pm-3m phase exhibits polar instability at the \Gamma point and
non-polar instability at the X, M, and R points under high pressure.

those of BaTi0.8Zr0.2O3 (BTZO), and BaTiO3 (BTO). Also, they are compared with
the eigenmodes of BTO calculated by using an ab-initio quantum-mechanical
frozen-phonon method. The sharp mode at 321 cm-1 of BTO, reported as a coupled
mode showing an interference effect, becomes progressively broader in BTZO and
BCTZO. This behavior, together with a broadening of the 527-cm-1 mode, suggests
that the mode-coupling is weakened in BTZO and BCTZO. The structural
transitions of BCTZO were investigated as functions of pressure at pressures
below 20 GPa and of temperature at temperatures below 600 K. Three
characteristic pressure-induced transitions, on each at 2.5, 5.0, and 13.0 GPa,
were found. The transitions are suggested by the drastic changes in phonon
modes (two softening modes, one each at ~ 300 and ~ 530 cm-1) and by the
transformation of the intensity profile. A temperature-induced transition was
found at a Curie temperature of ~ 380 K, where the average structure changes
from tetragonal to cubic. It is accompanied by a softening mode at ~ 530 cm-1.
The phonon spectrum of BCTZO suggests that its local environment is close to
that of BTZO. However, the characteristic pressures of BCTZO are close to those
of BTO. The sequence of pressure-induced transitions in both BCTZO and BTZO
illustrate rich interplay between the long-range averaged structure and the
short-range local order such that four distinguishable phases are suggested:
tetragonal, locally ordered but compensated cubic, disordered cubic, and ideal
cubic. We found that the critical pressures are plausibly related to the
average crystal lattice.

three-dimensional (3D) Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) with an angular momentum
rotation term and/or long-range dipole-dipole interaction, state the
two-dimensional (2D) GPE obtained from the 3D GPE via dimension reduction under
anisotropic external potential and review some dynamical laws related to the 2D
and 3D GPE. By introducing a rotating Lagrangian coordinate system, the
original GPEs are re-formulated to GPEs without the angular momentum rotation
which is replaced by a time-dependent potential in the new coordinate system.
We then cast the conserved quantities and dynamical laws in the new rotating
Lagrangian coordinates. Based on the new formulation of the GPE for rotating
BECs in the rotating Lagrangian coordinates, a time-splitting spectral method
is presented for computing the dynamics of rotating BECs. The new numerical
method is explicit, simple to implement, unconditionally stable and very
efficient in computation. It is spectral order accurate in space and
second-order accurate in time, and conserves the mass in the discrete level.
Extensive numerical results are reported to demonstrate the efficiency and
accuracy of the new numerical method. Finally, the numerical method is applied
to test the dynamical laws of rotating BECs such as the dynamics of condensate
width, angular momentum expectation and center-of-mass, and to investigate
numerically the dynamics and interaction of quantized vortex lattices in
rotating BECs without/with the long-range dipole-dipole interaction.

competition with thermodynamic description, review and analyse the related

competitive system can be characterised by a thermodynamic quantity -
competitive potential --- which determines the likely direction of evolution of
the system. Contested resources tend to move between systems from lower to
higher values of the competitive potential. There is, however, an important
difference between conventional thermodynamics and competitive thermodynamics.
While conventional thermodynamics is constrained by its zeroth law and is
fundamentally transitive, the transitivity of competitive thermodynamics
depends on the transitivity of the competition rules. Intransitivities are
common in the real world and are responsible for complex behaviour in
competitive systems.

turbulent combustion but reviews a much broader scope of issues linked to
mixing and competition, including thermodynamic characterisation of complex

is a multiple $ds$ of the dimension $s$. In this paper we give a fast computer
search algorithm to find good classical digital nets suitable for interlaced
components by using polynomial lattice point sets.
  We consider certain weighted Sobolev spaces of smoothness of arbitrarily high
order, and derive an upper bound on the mean square worst-case error for
digitally shifted higher order digital nets. Employing this upper bound as a
quality criterion, we prove that the component-by-component construction can be
used efficiently to find good polynomial lattice point sets suitable for
interlaced components. Through this approach we are able to get some
tractability results under certain conditions on the weights. Fast construction
using the fast Fourier transform requires the construction cost of $O(dsN \log
N)$ operations using $O(N)$ memory, where $N$ is the number of points and $s$
is the dimension. This implies a significant reduction in the construction cost
as compared to higher order polynomial lattice point sets. Numerical
experiments confirm that the performance of our constructed point sets often
outperforms those of higher order digital nets with Sobol' sequences and
Niederreiter-Xing sequences used for interlaced components, indicating the
usefulness of our algorithm.

to generate common randomness for a given subset of them. Knowing only the
communication, how many direct queries of the value of the common randomness
will resolve it? A general upper bound, valid for arbitrary signal alphabets,
is developed for the number of such queries by using a query strategy that
applies to all common randomness and associated communication. When the
underlying signals are independent and identically distributed repetitions of m
correlated random variables, the number of queries can be exponential in signal
length. For this case, the mentioned upper bound is tight and leads to a
single-letter formula for the largest query exponent, which coincides with the
secret key capacity of a corresponding multiterminal source model. In fact, the
upper bound constitutes a strong converse for the optimum query exponent, and
implies also a new strong converse for secret key capacity. A key tool,
estimating the size of a large probability set in terms of Renyi entropy, is
interpreted separately, too, as a lossless block coding result for general
sources. As a particularization, it yields the classic result for a discrete
memoryless source.

identify 1048 emission line galaxies with observed equivalent widths greater
than 40 Angstroms, 467 of which have multiple detected emission lines. The WISP
survey is sensitive to fainter flux levels (3-5x10^-17 ergs/s/cm^2) than the
future space near-infrared grism missions aimed at baryonic acoustic
oscillation cosmology (1-4x10^-16 ergs/s/cm^2), allowing us to probe the
fainter emission line galaxies that the shallower future surveys may miss.
Cumulative number counts of 0.7<z<1.5 galaxies reach 10,000 deg^-2 above an
H-alpha flux of 2x10^-16 ergs/s/cm^2. H-alpha-emitting galaxies with comparable
[OIII] flux are roughly 5 times less common than galaxies with just H-alpha
emission at those flux levels. Galaxies with low H-alpha/[OIII] ratios are very
rare at the brighter fluxes that future near-infrared grism surveys will probe;
our survey finds no galaxies with H-alpha/[OIII] < 0.95 that have H-alpha flux
greater than 3x10^-16 ergs/s/cm^2. Our H-alpha luminosity function contains a
comparable number density of faint line emitters to that found by the NICMOS

luminosity emitters. We also find that our high redshift (z=0.9-1.5) counts are
in agreement with the high redshift (z=1.47) narrow band H-alpha survey of
HiZELS (Sobral et al. 2013), while our lower redshift luminosity function
(z=0.3-0.9) falls slightly below their z=0.84 result. The evolution in both the

system described by a periodic potential model based on the Caldeira-Leggett
Hamiltonian with a biharmonic force. In this model, we use the reduced
hierarchy equations of motion in the Wigner space representation. These
equations represent a generalization of the Gaussian-Markovian quantum
Fokker-Planck equation introduced by Tanimura and Wolynes (1991), which was
formulated to study non-Markovian and non-perturbative thermal effects at
finite temperature. This formalism allows us to treat both the classical limit
and the tunneling regimes, and it is helpful for identifying purely quantum
mechanical effects through the time evolution of the Wigner distribution. We
carried out extensive calculations of the classical and quantum currents for
various temperatures, coupling strengths, and barrier heights. Our results
reveal that at low temperature, while the quantum current is larger than the
classical current in the case of a high barrier, the opposite is true in the
case of a low barrier. We find that this behavior results from the fact that
the tunneling enhances the current in the case of a high barrier, while it
suppresses the current in the case of a low barrier. This is because the effect
of the ratchet potential is weak in the case of a low barrier, due to the large
dispersion of the distribution introduced by tunneling. This causes the
spatio-temporal asymmetry, which is necessary for ratchet current, to be weak,
and as a result, the net current is suppressed.

distribution as in a dark matter halo with a radially varying eccentricity.
This is obtained by summing up the shell-by-shell contributions of isodensity
surfaces, which are taken to be concentric and with a common polar axis and
with an axis ratio that varies with radius. Interestingly, the constancy of
potential inside a shell is shown to be a good approximation even when the
isodensity contours are dissimilar spheroids, as long as the radial variation
in eccentricity is small as seen in realistic systems. We consider three cases
where the isodensity contours are more prolate at large radii, or are less
prolate, or have a constant eccentricity. Other relevant physical quantities
like the rotation velocity, the net orbital and vertical frequency due to the
halo and an exponential disc of finite thickness embedded in it are obtained.
We apply this to the kinematical origin of Galactic warp, and show that a
prolate shaped halo is not conducive to making long-lived warps - contrary to
what has been proposed in the literature. The results for a prolate mass
distribution with a variable axis ratio obtained are general, and can be
applied to other astrophysical systems such as prolate bars, for a more
realistic treatment.

planetary companions. We demonstrate that multi-planet systems are prone to
instabilities as a result of frequent stellar encounters in these star clusters
much more than single-planet systems. The cumulative effect of close and
distant encounters on these planetary systems are investigated using Monte
Carlo scattering experiments. We consider two types of planetary configurations
orbiting Sun-like stars: (i) five Jupiter-mass planets in the semi-major axis
range 1-42 AU orbiting a Solar mass star, with orbits that are initially
co-planar, circular, and separated by 10 mutual Hill radii, and (ii) the four
gas giants of our Solar system. Planets with short orbital periods are not
directly affected by encountering stars. However, secular evolution of
perturbed systems may result in the ejection of the innermost planets or in
physical collisions of the innermost planets with the host star, up to many
thousands of years after a stellar encounter. The simulations of the Solar
system-like systems indicate that Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are affected by
both direct interactions with encountering stars, as well as planet-planet
scattering. Jupiter, on the other hand, is almost only affected by direct
encounters with neighbouring stars, as its mass is too large to be
substantially perturbed by the other three planets. Our results indicate that
stellar encounters can account for the apparent scarcity of exoplanets in star
clusters, not only for those on wide-orbit that are directly affected by
stellar encounters, but also planets close to the star which can disappear long
after a stellar encounter has perturbed the planetary system.

  using Network Coding",,,,,"cs.IT cs.CR math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a method for securely delivering a set of messages to a group of
clients over a broadcast erasure channel where each client is interested in a
distinct message. Each client is able to obtain its own message but not the
others'. In the proposed method the messages are combined together using a
special variant of random linear network coding. Each client is provided with a
private set of decoding coefficients to decode its own message. Our method
provides security for the transmission sessions against computational
brute-force attacks and also weakly security in information theoretic sense. As
the broadcast channel is assumed to be erroneous, the missing coded packets
should be recovered in some way. We consider two different scenarios. In the
first scenario the missing packets are retransmitted by the base station
(centralized). In the second scenario the clients cooperate with each other by
exchanging packets (decentralized). In both scenarios, network coding
techniques are exploited to increase the total throughput. For the case of
centralized retransmissions we provide an analytical approximation for the
throughput performance of instantly decodable network coded (IDNC)
retransmissions as well as numerical experiments. For the decentralized
scenario, we propose a new IDNC based retransmission method where its
performance is evaluated via simulations and analytical approximation.
Application of this method is not limited to our special problem and can be
generalized to a new class of problems introduced in this paper as the
cooperative index coding problem.

observe in three-dimensional (3D) systems. Thermal fluctuations in 2D systems
are enhanced, and they prevent the conventional Bose-Einstein condensation
(BEC) at non-zero temperatures by destroying the long-range order. However, a
phase transition to a superfluid phase is still expected to occur in a 2D
system along with an emergence of a quasi-long-range order, explained by the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) mechanism. Within the BKT mechanism, a
universal jump of the superfluid density in a 2D Bosonic system was
theoretically predicted by Nelson and Kosterlitz, and was first observed in 2D
\textsuperscript{4}He films by Bishop and Reppy. Recent experiments in trapped
ultracold 2D Bose gas systems have shown signatures of the BKT transition, and
its superfluidity. However, the universal jump in the superfluid density was
not observed in these systems. Here we report the first observation of the
universal jump in the superfluid density using an optically trapped ultracold
2D Bose gas. The measured superfluid phase space density at the BKT transition
agrees well with the predicted value within our measurement uncertainty.
Additionally, we measure the phase fluctuations in our density profiles to show
that the BKT transition occurs first, followed by the BEC transition.

breathing modes in ultrafast spectroscopy of single wall carbon nanotubes.
Photoexcited excitons can be localized spatially and give rise to a spatially
distributed driving force in real space which involves many phonon wavevectors
of the exciton-phonon interaction. The equation of motion for the coherent
phonons is modeled phenomenologically by the Klein-Gordon equation, which we
solve for the oscillation amplitudes as a function of space and time. By
averaging the calculated amplitudes per nanotube length, we obtain
time-dependent coherent phonon amplitudes that resemble the homogeneous
oscillations that are observed in some pump-probe experiments. We interpret
this result to mean that the experiments are only able to see a spatial average
of coherent phonon oscillations over the wavelength of light in carbon
nanotubes and the microscopic details are averaged out. Our interpretation is
justified by calculating the time-dependent absorption spectra resulting from
the macroscopic atomic displacements induced by the coherent phonon
oscillations. The calculated coherent phonon spectra including excitonic
effects show the experimentally observed symmetric peaks at the nanotube
transition energies in contrast to the asymmetric peaks that would be obtained
if excitonic effects were not included.

(ii) The double-layer defect clusters are formed by self-organized stacking of
FOSs on the close-packed plane; (iii) The stacking faults surrounded by the
Shockley partial dislocations are created from the double-layer defect cluster
due to the relative slip of internal atoms. Whereas, the void nucleation is
shown to follow a two-stages description: (i) The vacancy strings are first

our findings on the origin of dislocation creation and void nucleation is

timed control action typically includes not only disabling action as in the

formulated in terms of tropical mathematics and consists in minimizing a
nonlinear objective function subject to linear inequality constraints. To solve
the problem, we follow an approach based on the introduction of an additional
unknown variable to reduce the problem to solving linear inequalities, where
the variable plays the role of a parameter. A necessary and sufficient
condition for the inequalities to hold is used to evaluate the parameter,
whereas the general solution of the inequalities is taken as a solution of the
original problem. Under fairly general assumptions, a complete direct solution
to the problem is obtained in a compact vector form. The result is applied to
solve a problem in project scheduling when an optimal schedule is given by
minimizing the flow time of activities in a project under various activity
precedence constraints. As an illustration, a numerical example of optimal
scheduling is also presented.

higher probe intensities, our model deviates from other theoretical approaches,

collects profiling data, closing the loop of the SW tool chain. Fine-grain
parallelism inside processes is exploited by optimized intra-tile compilation
techniques, but the project focus is above the level of the elementary tile.
The elementary HW tile is a multi-processor, which includes a fault tolerant
Distributed Network Processor (for inter-tile communication) and ASIP
accelerators. Furthermore, EURETILE investigates and implements the innovations
for equipping the elementary HW tile with high-bandwidth, low-latency
brain-like inter-tile communication emulating 3 levels of connection hierarchy,
namely neural columns, cortical areas and cortex, and develops a dedicated

excitation energy is transferred (in many cases over long distances) to a
neighbor of the initially excited particle usually ionizing that neighbor. It
turned out that ICD is a very common decay route in nature as it occurs across
van-der-Waals and hydrogen bonds. The time evolution of ICD is predicted to be
highly complex, as its efficiency strongly depends on the distance of the atoms
involved and this distance typically changes during the decay. Here we present

perturbation of wave type equations. This observation can be exploited in
several different ways and it turns out that it is a usefull tool when studying
controllability. Here we compare a viscoelastic system which fills a surface of
a solid region (the string case has already been studied) with its memoryless
counterpart (which is a generalized telegraph equation) in order to prove exact
controllability of the viscoelastic body at precisely the same times at which
the telegraph equation is controllable.
  The comparison is done using a moment method approach to controllability and
we prove, using the perturbations theorems of Paley-Wiener and Bari, that a new
sequence derived from the viscoelastic system is a Riesz sequence, a fact that
implies controllability of the viscoelastic system.
  The results so obtained generalize existing controllability results and
furthermore show that the ``sharp'' control time for the telegraph equation and
the viscoelastic system coincide.

are developed to reduce the computational complexity of Maximum-Likelihood (ML)

terms of Bit Error Ratio (BER) and computational complexity.
  Using Monte Carlo simulations and mathematical analysis, it is shown that by
carefully choosing the initial radius the proposed sphere decoder algorithms
offer the same BER as ML detection, with a significant reduction in the
computational complexity.
  A tight closed form expression for the BER performance of SM-SD is derived in
the paper, along with an algorithm for choosing the initial radius which
provides near to optimum performance. Also, it is shown that none of the
proposed SDs are always superior to the others, but the best SD to use depends
on the target spectral efficiency. The computational complexity trade-off
offered by the proposed solutions is studied via analysis and simulation, and
is shown to validate our findings. Finally, the performance of SM-SDs are
compared to Spatial Multiplexing (SMX) applying ML decoder and applying SD.
  It is shown that for the same spectral efficiency, SM-SD offers up to 84%
reduction in complexity compared to SMX-SD, with up to 1 dB better BER

thermal evolution in high resolution simulations. As previous investigations
raised doubts regarding the convergence of the temperature at high resolution,
we investigate the role of the numerical method employed to model the chemistry

adaptive-mesh refinement code \verb|ENZO|, employing a first order backward

\verb|DLSODES|. While the standard implementation in \verb|ENZO| shows a strong
dependence on the employed resolution, the results obtained with \verb|DLSODES|

of an infinite one dimensional gapless quantum system in the case where the
region is centered on a quantum impurity. The coupling to this impurity is not
scale invariant, and the physics involves a crossover between weak and strong
coupling regimes. While the impurity contribution to the entanglement has been
computed numerically in the past, little is known analytically about it, since
in particular the methods of conformal invariance cannot be applied because of
the presence of a crossover length. We show in this paper that the small
coupling expansion of the entanglement entropy in this problem is quite
generally plagued by strong infrared divergences, implying a non-perturbative
dependence on the coupling. The large coupling expansion turns out to be better
behaved, thanks to powerful results from the boundary CFT formulation and, in
some cases, the underlying integrability of the problem. However, it is clear
that this expansion does not capture well the crossover physics. In the
integrable case -- which includes problems such as an XXZ chain with a modified
link, the interacting resonant level model or the anisotropic Kondo model -- a
non perturbative approach is in principle possible using form-factors. We adapt
in this paper the ideas of [1,2] to the gapless case and show that, in the
rather simple case of the resonant level model, and after some additional
renormalizations, the form factors approach yields remarkably accurate results
for the entanglement all the way from short to large distances. This is
confirmed by detailed comparison with numerical simulations. Both our form
factor and numerical results are compatible with a non-perturbative form at
short distance.

almost 96 per cent of the total share and SM accounts only for 10 to 13 per

that in the static 3-user MIMO square IC, the number of degrees-of-freedom

achieved with the worst accuracy taken across the TXs and across the

while the final event was a major X1.8 solar eruptive flare. The events during
the pre-eruption phase, i.e., before the X1.8 flare, are characterized by
localized episodes of energy release occurring in the vicinity of an active
region filament which produced intense heating along with non-thermal emission.
A few minutes before the eruption, the filament undergoes an activation phase
during which it slowly rises with a speed of ~12 km/s. The filament eruption is
accompanied with an X1.8 flare during which multiple HXR bursts are observed up
to 100-300 keV energies. We observe a bright and elongated coronal structure
simultaneously in E(UV) and 50-100 keV HXR images underneath the expanding
filament during the period of HXR bursts which provides strong evidence for
ongoing magnetic reconnection. This phase is accompanied with very high plasma
temperatures of ~31 MK and followed by the detachment of the prominence from
the solar source region. From the location, timing, strength, and spectrum of
HXR emission, we conclude that the prominence eruption is driven by the
distinct events of magnetic reconnection occurring in a current sheet formed
below the erupting filament. These multi-wavelength observations also suggest
that the localized magnetic reconnections associated with different
evolutionary stages of the filament in the pre-eruption phase play a crucial
role in destabilizing the filament by a tether-cutting process leading to
large-scale eruption and X-class flare.

gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), with the highest energy photons reaching about 100
GeV. One proposed scenario is that they are produced by high-energy electrons
accelerated in GRB forward shocks via synchrotron radiation. We study the
maximum synchrotron photon energy in this scenario, considering the properties
of the microturbluence magnetic fields behind the shock, as revealed by recent
Particle-in-Cell simulations and theoretical analyses of relativistic
collisionless shocks. Due to the small-scale nature of the micro-turbulent
magnetic field, the Bohm acceleration approximation breaks down at such high
energies. This effect leads to a typical maximum synchrotron photon of a few
GeV at 100 s after the burst and this maximum synchrotron photon energy
decreases quickly with time. We show that the fast decrease of the maximum
synchrotron photon energy leads to a fast decay of the synchrotron flux. The
10-100 GeV photons detected after the prompt phase can not be produced by the
synchrotron mechanism. They could originate from the synchrotron self-Compton
emission of the early afterglow if the circum-burst density is sufficiently
large, or from the external inverse-Compton process in the presence of central
X-ray emission, such as X-ray flares and prompt high-latitude X-ray emission.

targets becomes increasingly hard since optical occlusions are very likely,
i.e. two featureless targets frequently overlap for several frames. Occlusions
are particularly frequent in biological groups such as bird flocks, fish
schools, and insect swarms, a fact that has severely limited collective animal
behavior field studies in the past. This paper presents a 3D tracking method
that is robust in the case of severe occlusions. To ensure robustness, we adopt
a global optimization approach that works on all objects and frames at once. To
achieve practicality and scalability, we employ a divide and conquer
formulation, thanks to which the computational complexity of the problem is
reduced by orders of magnitude. We tested our algorithm with synthetic data,
with experimental data of bird flocks and insect swarms and with public
benchmark datasets, and show that our system yields high quality trajectories
for hundreds of moving targets with severe overlap. The results obtained on
very heterogeneous data show the potential applicability of our method to the
most diverse experimental situations.

the beam midline is assumed to be implicitly described by a vector distance

the tangential direction, and thus there is no need to introduce normal

the geometry of the beam midline. While it is intuitive to formulate curved
beam models in these local coordinates, the Frenet frame suffers from ambiguity
and sudden changes of orientation in straight sections of the beam.

formulate a new problem, named Willingness mAximization for Social grOup

demonstrates that social groups obtained by the proposed algorithm

correlations on large scales, we compare its results with those of an N-body
simulation of a 3 Gpc/h box sampled with 2048^3 particles taken from the MICE
suite, matching the same seeds for the initial conditions. Thanks to the FFTW
libraries and to the relatively simple design, the code shows very good scaling
properties. The CPU time required by PINOCCHIO is a tiny fraction (~1/2000) of
that required by the MICE simulation. Varying some of PINOCCHIO numerical
parameters allows one to produce a universal mass function that lies in the
range allowed by published fits, although it underestimates the MICE mass
function of FoF halos in the high mass tail. We compare the matter-halo and the
halo-halo power spectra with those of the MICE simulation and find that these
2-point statistics are well recovered on large scales. In particular, when
catalogs are matched in number density, agreement within ten per cent is
achieved for the halo power spectrum. At scales k>0.1 h/Mpc, the inaccuracy of
the Zel'dovich approximation in locating halo positions causes an underestimate
of the power spectrum that can be modeled as a Gaussian factor with a damping
scale of d=3 Mpc/h at z=0, decreasing at higher redshift. Finally, a remarkable
match is obtained for the reduced halo bispectrum, showing a good description
of nonlinear halo bias. Our results demonstrate the potential of PINOCCHIO as
an accurate and flexible tool for generating large ensembles of mock galaxy
surveys, with interesting applications for the analysis of large galaxy

deuterons, tritons, helions and alpha particles are taken into account in the
hydrodynamical simulations in addition to the ordinary charged-current
interactions with nucleons. Axial symmetry is assumed but no equatorial
symmetry is imposed. We show that the heating rates of deuterons reach as high
as 10% of those of nucleons around the bottom of the gain region. On the other
hand, alpha particles are heated near the shock wave, which is important when
the shock wave expands and the density and temperature of matter become low. It
is also found that the models with heating by light nuclei have different
evolutions from those without it in the non-linear phase of SASI. This results
is because matter in the gain region has a varying density and temperature and
there appear sub-regions that are locally rich in deuterons and alpha
particles. Although the light nuclei are never dominant heating sources and
they work favorably for shock revival in some cases and unfavorably in other
cases, they are non-negligible and warrant further investigation.

another class where the subset of spin-0 symmetries is maximal, the massless

ultimately study the pattern of gluonic excitations in the meson spectrum
produced in $\gamma p$ collisions. Recent lattice QCD calculations predict a
rich spectrum of hybrid mesons that have both exotic and non-exotic $J^{PC}$,
corresponding to $q\bar{q}$ states ($q=u,$ $d,$ or $s$) coupled with a gluonic
field. A thorough study of the hybrid spectrum, including the identification of
the isovector triplet, with charges 0 and $\pm1$, and both isoscalar members,
$|s\bar{s}\ >$ and $|u\bar{u}\ > + |d\bar{d}\ >$, for each predicted hybrid
combination of $J^{PC}$, may only be achieved by conducting a systematic
amplitude analysis of many different hadronic final states. Detailed studies of
the performance of the \gx detector have indicated that identification of
particular final states with kaons is possible using the baseline detector
configuration. The efficiency of kaon detection coupled with the relatively
lower production cross section for particles containing hidden strangeness will
require a high intensity run in order for analyses of such states to be
feasible. We propose to collect a total of 200 days of physics analysis data at
an average intensity of $5\times 10^7$ tagged photons on target per second.
This data sample will provide an order of magnitude statistical improvement
over the initial GlueX running, which will allow us to begin a program of
studying mesons and baryons containing strange quarks. In addition, the
increased intensity will permit us to study reactions that may have been
statistically limited in the initial phases of GlueX. Overall, this will lead
to a significant increase in the potential for \gx to make key experimental
advances in our knowledge of hybrid mesons and excited $\Xi$ baryons.

Recently we justified rigorously that the PSS in single particle resonant
states is exactly conserved when the attractive scalar and repulsive vector
potentials of the Dirac Hamiltonian have the same magnitude but opposite sign
[PRL 109, 072501 (2012)]. To understand more deeply the PSS, we focus on
several issues related to the exact conservation and breaking mechanism of the
PSS in single particle resonances. In particular, we are interested in how the
energy and width splittings of PS partners depend on the depth of the scalar
and vector potentials. We investigate the asymptotic behaviors of radial Dirac
wave functions. Spherical square well potentials are employed in which the PSS
breaking part in the Jost function can be well isolated. By examining the zeros
of Jost functions corresponding to small components of the radial Dirac wave
functions, general properties of the PSS are analyzed. By examining the Jost
function, the occurrence of intruder orbitals is explained and it is possible
to trace continuously the PSS partners from the PSS limit to the case with a
finite potential depth. The dependence of the PSS in resonances as well as in
bound states on the potential depth is investigated systematically. We find a
threshold effect in the energy splitting and an anomaly in the width splitting
of pseudospin partners when the depth of the single particle potential varies
from zero to a finite value. The conservation and the breaking of the PSS in
resonant states and bound states share some similar properties. The appearance
of intruder states can be explained by examining the zeros of Jost functions.
Origins of the threshold effect in the energy splitting and the anomaly in the
width splitting of PS partners, together with many other problems, are still
open and should be further investigated.

identical spin clusters is difficult, new strategies are in order to determine
individual node structures with the highest precision. Here we use a pulse
protocol to monitor the time evolution of the 13C ensemble in the vicinity of a
NV center. We observe long-lived time correlations in the nuclear spin
dynamics, limited by NV spin-lattice relaxation. We use the host 14N spin as a
quantum register, and demonstrate that hyperfine-shifted resonances can be
separated upon proper NV initialization. Intriguingly, we find that the
amplitude of the correlation signal exhibits a sharp dependence on the applied
magnetic field. We discuss this observation in the context of the
quantum-to-classical transition proposed recently to explain the field

surface navigation, which allows physicians and treatment planners to
interactively navigate through treatment planning options to get an
understanding of the tradeoffs (dose to the target versus over-dosing of
important nearby organs) involved in each patient's plan. We also describe goal
programming and prioritized optimization, two other methods designed to handle
multiple conflicting objectives. Issues related to nonconvexities, both in
terms of dosimetric goals and the fact that the mapping from controllable
hardware parameters to patient doses is usually nonconvex, are discussed at
length since nonconvexities have a large impact on practical solution
techniques for Pareto surface construction and navigation. A general planning
strategy is recommended which handles the issue of nonconvexity by first
finding an ideal Pareto surface with radiation delivered from many preset
angles. This can be cast as a convex optimization problem. Once a high quality
solution is selected from the Pareto surface, a sparse version (which can mean
fewer beams, fewer segments, less leaf travel for arc therapy techniques, etc.)
is obtained using an appropriate sparsification heuristic. We end by discussing
issues of efficiency regarding the planning and the delivery of radiation
therapy.

include the 2-sphere, the cylinder, the vanishing mean curvature catenoid (a
minimal surface) and the richer and less investigated unduloid and nodoid. We
determine numerically candidate ground state configurations for 1000 point-like
particles interacting with a pairwise-repulsive dipole-dipole interaction
potential. We mimic stretching of capillary bridges by determining the
equilibrium configurations of particles arrayed on a sequence of Delaunay
surfaces obtained by increasing or decreasing the height at constant volume
starting from a given initial surface, either a fat cylinder or a square
cylinder. In this case the stretching process takes one through a complicated
sequence of Delaunay surfaces each with different geometrical parameters
including the aspect ratio, mean curvature and maximal Gaussian curvature.
Unduloids, catenoids and nodoids all appear in this process. Defect motifs in
the ground state evolve from dislocations at the boundary to dislocations in
the interior to pleats and scars in the interior and then isolated 7-fold
disclinations in the interior as the capillary bridge narrows at the waist
(equator) and the maximal (negative) Gaussian curvature grows. We also check
theoretical predictions that the isolated disclinations are present in the
ground state when the surface contains a geodesic disc with integrated Gaussian
curvature exceeding -pi/3. Finally we explore minimal energy configurations on
sets of slices of a given Delaunay surface and obtain configurations and defect
motifs consistent with those seen in stretching.

$\rm\bar{\Omega}$$^{+}/{\rm \Omega}^{-}$ in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 0.9$,
2.76 and 7 TeV, measured with the ALICE detector at the LHC, are reported.
Within the experimental uncertainties and ranges covered by our measurement,
these ratios are independent of rapidity, transverse momentum and multiplicity
for all measured energies. The results are compared to expectations from event
generators, such as PYTHIA and HIJING-B, that are used to model the particle
production in pp collisions. The energy dependence of $\bar{\rm p}/{\rm p}$,
$\bar{\rm \Lambda}/{\rm \Lambda}$, $\rm\bar{\Xi}$$^{+}/{\rm \Xi^{-}}$ and
$\rm\bar{\Omega}$$^{+}/{\rm \Omega^{-}}$, reaching values compatible with unity
for $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV, complement the earlier $\bar{\rm p}/{\rm p}$
measurement of ALICE. These dependencies can be described by exchanges with the
Regge-trajectory intercept of $\alpha_{\rm {J}} \approx 0.5$, which are
suppressed with increasing rapidity interval ${\rm \Delta} y$. Any significant
contribution of an exchange not suppressed at large ${\rm \Delta} y$ (reached
at LHC energies) is disfavoured.

prior to type Ia supernova (SN Ia) explosion in the core-degenerate scenario
can account for the appearance of two opposite lobes ('Ears') along the
symmetry axis of the SN remnant (SNR). In the double-degenerate and
core-degenerate scenarios the merger of the two degenerate compact objects is
very likely to lead to the formation of an accretion disk, that might launch
two opposite jets. In the CD scenario these jets interact with the envelope
ejected during the preceding common envelope phase. If explosion occurs shortly
after the merger process, the exploding gas and the jets will collide with the
ejected nebula, leading to SNR with axisymmetric components including 'Ears'.
We also explore the possibility that the jets are launched by the companion
white dwarf prior to its merger with the core. This last process is similar to
the one where jets are launched in some pre-planetary nebulae. The SNR 'Ears'
in this case are formed by a spherical SN Ia explosion inside an elliptical
planetary nebula-like object. We compare our numerical results with two SNRs -
Kepler and G299.2-2.9.

maintained on a distance shorter than the theory-defined quantum correlation
length (lc). When, the physical length of the problem is larger than lc, the
model shows that the quantum (potential) interactions may have a finite range
of interaction maintaining the non-local behavior on a finite distance quantum
non-locality length lq. The present work shows that when the mean molecular
distance is larger than the quantum non-locality length we have a classical
phases (gas and van der Waals liquids) while when the mean molecular distance
becomes smaller than lq or than lc we have phases such as the solid crystal or
the superfluid one, respectively, that show quantum characteristics. The model
agrees with Lindemann empirical law (and explains it), for the mean square
deviation of atom from the equilibrium position at melting point of crystal,
and shows a connection between the maximum density at the He lambda point and
that one near the water-ice solidification point.

catalogs, based on a semi-analytic galaxy formation model, constructed
specifically for Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Surveys in order to assess the
performance of the Probability Friends-of-Friends (PFOF, Liu et al.) group
finder, and aim to develop a grouping optimization method applicable to surveys
like Pan-STARRS1. Producing mock PFOF group catalogs under a variety of
photometric redshift accuracies ({\sigma}{\Delta}z/(1+zs)), we find that
catalog purities and completenesses from ``good' {\sigma}{\Delta}z/(1+zs)) ~
0.01) to ``poor' {\sigma}{\Delta}z/(1+zs)) ~ 0.07) photo-zs gradually degrade
respectively from 77% and 70% to 52% and 47%. To avoid model dependency of the
mock for use on observational data we apply a ``subset optimization' approach,
using spectroscopic-redshift group data from the target field to train the
group finder for application to that field, as an alternative method for the
grouping optimization. We demonstrate this approach using these
spectroscopically identified groups as the training set, i.e. zCOSMOS groups
for PFOF searches within PS1 Medium Deep Field04 (PS1MD04) and DEEP2 EGS groups
for searches in PS1MD07. We ultimately apply PFOF to four datasets spanning the
photo-z uncertainty range from 0.01 to 0.06 in order to quantify the dependence
of group recovery performance on photo-z accuracy. We find purities and
completenesses calculated from observational datasets broadly agree with their
mock analogues. Further tests of the PFOF algorithm are performed via matches
to X-ray clusters identified within the PS1MD04 and COSMOS footprints. Across
over a decade in group mass, we find PFOF groups match ~85% of X-ray clusters
in COSMOS and PS1MD04, but at a lower statistical significance in the latter.

product ratings so that users can evaluate the quality of products. Product
ratings are important since they affect how well a product will be adopted by
the market. The challenge is that we only have {\em ""partial information""} on
these ratings: Each user provides ratings to only a ""{\em small subset of
products}"". Under this partial information setting, we explore a number of
fundamental questions: What is the ""{\em minimum number of ratings}"" a product
needs so one can make a reliable evaluation of its quality? How users' {\em
misbehavior} (such as {\em cheating}) in product rating may affect the
evaluation result? To answer these questions, we present a formal mathematical
model of product evaluation based on partial information. We derive theoretical
bounds on the minimum number of ratings needed to produce a reliable indicator
of a product's quality. We also extend our model to accommodate users'
misbehavior in product rating. We carry out experiments using both synthetic
and real-world data (from TripAdvisor, Amazon and eBay) to validate our model,
and also show that using the ""majority rating rule"" to aggregate product
ratings, it produces more reliable and robust product evaluation results than
the ""average rating rule"".

and corona / chromosphere interface is examined for impulsive heating over a
range of magnitudes using one dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. It is
demonstrated that the principle effect of inadequate resolution is on the
coronal density. An underresolved loop typically has a peak density of at least
a factor of two lower than a resolved loop subject to the same heating, with
larger discrepencies in the decay phase. The temperature for under-resolved
loops is also lower indicating that lack of resolution does not ""bottle up"" the
heat flux in the corona. Energy is conserved in the models to under 1% in all
cases, indicating that this is not responsible for the low density. Instead, we
argue that in under-resolved loops the heat flux ""jumps across"" the transition
region to the dense chromosphere from which it is radiated rather than heating
and ablating transition region plasma. This emphasises the point that the
interaction between corona and chromosphere occurs only through the medium of
the transition region. Implications for three dimensional magnetohydrodynamic
coronal models are discussed.

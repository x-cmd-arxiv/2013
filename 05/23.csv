hindered by its computational demand, that requires the solution of linear
systems of size equal to the number of data points. Our reconstruction
implementation relies on parallel scientific libraries and is supported for
massively multi-core architectures, namely Graphic Processor Units (GPUs). The
performance of the proposed method in terms of accuracy of the reconstruction
and computing time shows that the RBF interpolant can be very effective for
such problem.

higher-spin theories in AdS and of CFTs with exact higher-spin symmetry, i.e.
conserved tensors of rank greater than two. The Jacobi identity for the gauge
algebra is the simplest consistency test that appears at the quartic order for
a gauge theory. Similarly, the algebra of charges in a CFT must also obey the
Jacobi identity. These algebras are essentially the same. Solving the Jacobi
identity under some simplifying assumptions spelled out, we obtain that the
Eastwood-Vasiliev algebra is the unique solution for d=4 and d>6. In 5d there
is a one-parameter family of algebras that was known before. In particular, we
show that the introduction of a single higher-spin gauge field/current
automatically requires the infinite tower of higher-spin gauge fields/currents.
The result implies that from all the admissible non-Abelian cubic vertices in
AdS(d), that have been recently classified for totally symmetric higher-spin
gauge fields, only one vertex can pass the Jacobi consistency test. This cubic
vertex is associated with a gauge deformation that is the germ of the
Eastwood-Vasiliev's higher-spin algebra.

particles (WIMPs) are commonly limited in sensitivity by neutron and gamma
backgrounds from the decay of radioactive isotopes. Several common
radioisotopes in detector construction materials are found in long decay
chains, notably those headed by 238U, 235U, and 232Th. Gamma radioassay using
Ge detectors identifies decay rates of a few of the radioisotopes in each
chain, and typically assumes that the chain is in secular equilibrium. If the
chains are out of equilibrium, detector background rates can be elevated
significantly above expectation. In this work we quantify the increase in
neutron and gamma production rates from an excess of various sub-chains of the
238U decay chain. We find that the 226Ra sub-chain generates x10 higher neutron
flux per decay than the 238U early sub-chain and 210Pb sub-chain, in materials
with high (alpha,n) neutron yields. Typical gamma screening results limit
potential 238U early sub-chain activity to x20-60 higher than 226Ra sub-chain
activity. Monte Carlo simulation is used to quantify the contribution of the
sub-chains of 238U to low-energy nuclear recoil (NR) and electron recoil (ER)
backgrounds in simplified one tonne liquid Ar and liquid Xe detectors. NR and
ER rates generated by 238U sub-chains in the Ar and Xe detectors are found
after comparable fiducial and multiple-scatter cuts. The Xe detector is found
to have x12 higher signal-to-background for 100 GeV WIMPs over neutrons than
the Ar detector. ER backgrounds in both detectors are found to increase weakly
for excesses of 238U early sub-chain and 210Pb sub-chain relative to 226Ra
sub-chain. Experiments in which backgrounds are NR-dominated are sensitive to
undetected excesses of 238U early sub-chain and 210Pb sub-chain concentrations.
Experiments with ER-dominated backgrounds are relatively insensitive to these
excesses.

these Hilbert spaces that satisfy certain normalization and consistency
conditions is called a quantum sequential growth process (QSGP). The operators
of a QSGP are employed to define natural decoherence functionals and quantum
measures. These quantum measures are extended to a single quantum measure
defined on a suitable collection of subsets of a space of all paths. Continuing
our general formalism, we define curvature operators and a discrete analogue of
Einstein's field equations on the Hilbert space of causal sets. We next present
a method for constructing a QSGP using an amplitude process (AP). We then
consider a specific AP that employs a discrete analogue of a quantum action.
Finally, we consider the special case in which the QSGP is classical. It is
pointed out that this formalism not only gives a discrete version of general
relativity, there is also emerging a discrete analogue of quantum field theory.
We therefore have discrete versions of these two theories within one unifying

non-perturbative effects. We substantiate our proposal by a rigorous analysis
of a toy model, namely the 2-dimensional Gross-Neveu model. In particular, we
address, within this model, the key question of the renormalization ambiguities
affecting the calculation. The stress energy operator is constructed concretely
via the operator-product-expansion. The non-perturbative factor in the vacuum
energy is seen as a consequence of the facts that a) the OPE-coefficients have
an analytic dependence on $g$, b) the vacuum correlations have a non-analytic

$\Lambda$ is an energy scale such as $\Lambda = M_{H}$, and $g$ is a gauge

major failures in practical applications. However, approximate functionals are
not normally expressed in terms of the fractional variables. Here we develop a
general framework for extending approximate density functionals and
many-electron theory to fractional-charge and fractional-spin systems. Our
development allows for the fractional extension of any approximate theory that
is a functional of $G^{0}$, the one-electron Green's function of the
non-interacting reference system. The extension to fractional charge and
fractional spin systems is based on the ensemble average of the basic variable,
$G^{0}$. We demonstrate the fractional extension for the following theories:
(1) any explicit functional of the one-electron density, such as the LDA and
GGA; (2) any explicit functional of the one-electron density matrix of the
non-interacting reference system, such as the exact exchange functional and
hybrid functionals; (3) many-body perturbation theory; and (4) random-phase
approximations. A general rule for such an extension has also been derived
through scaling the orbitals and should be useful for functionals where the
link to the Green's function is not obvious. The development thus enables the
examination of approximate theories against known exact conditions on the
fractional variables and the analysis of their failures in chemical and
physical applications in terms of violations of exact conditions of the energy
functionals. The present work should facilitate the calculation of chemical
potentials and fundamental band gaps with approximate functionals and

if the onset of high eccentricity planet migration is also a time when planet
are sent into merge with the star. Planet migration into the star is likely a
complementary explanation to the view that systems with higher initial iron
abundance form more planets, and that more crowded planets are more likely to
scatter into eccentric orbits. Planets of iron-rich single stars have
eccentricity distributions that are higher than planets of iron-poor single

  Communications in Mathematics and Statistics",,"10.1007/s40304-015-0078-6",,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Statistical and machine learning theory has developed several conditions
ensuring that popular estimators such as the Lasso or the Dantzig selector
perform well in high-dimensional sparse regression, including the restricted
eigenvalue, compatibility, and $\ell_q$ sensitivity properties. However, some
of the central aspects of these conditions are not well understood. For
instance, it is unknown if these conditions can be checked efficiently on any
given data set. This is problematic, because they are at the core of the theory
of sparse regression.
  Here we provide a rigorous proof that these conditions are NP-hard to check.
This shows that the conditions are computationally infeasible to verify, and
raises some questions about their practical applications.
  However, by taking an average-case perspective instead of the worst-case view
of NP-hardness, we show that a particular condition, $\ell_q$ sensitivity, has
certain desirable properties. This condition is weaker and more general than
the others. We show that it holds with high probability in models where the
parent population is well behaved, and that it is robust to certain data
processing steps. These results are desirable, as they provide guidance about
when the condition, and more generally the theory of sparse regression, may be
relevant in the analysis of high-dimensional correlated observational data.

cavity, and ballistic pressure wave) are described in the wound ballistics
literature, they all have their physical origin in the retarding force between
bullet and tissue as the bullet penetrates. If the bullet path is the same,
larger retarding forces produce larger wounding effects and a greater
probability of rapid incapacitation. By Newton's third law, the force of the
bullet on the tissue is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the
force of the tissue on the bullet. For bullets penetrating with constant mass,
the retarding force on the bullet can be determined by frame by frame analysis
of high speed video of the bullet penetrating a suitable tissue simulant such
as calibrated 10% ballistic gelatin. Here the technique is demonstrated with
9mm NATO bullets, 32 cm long blocks of gelatin, and a high speed video camera
operating at 20,000 frames per second. It is found that different 9mm NATO
bullets have a wide variety of potential for wounding and rapid incapacitation.
This technique also determines the energy transfer in the first 15 cm and/or
first 30 cm of tissue, which are important parameters in estimating the
probability of rapid incapacitation in some of the ARL/BRL models. This method
predicts that some 9mm bullets have a much higher probability of rapid
incapacitation than others and the rank ordering of bullet effectiveness is in
agreement with other studies.

methods for spectrally efficient video on-demand wireless streaming are
essential to service providers and users alike. A key property of video
on-demand is the asynchronous content reuse, such that a few dominant videos
account for a large part of the traffic, but are viewed by users at different
times. Caching of content on devices in conjunction with D2D communications
allows to exploit this property, and provide a network throughput that is
significantly in excess of both the conventional approach of unicasting from
the base station and the traditional D2D networks for regular data traffic.
This paper presents in a semi-tutorial concise form some recent results on the
throughput scaling laws of wireless networks with caching and asynchronous
content reuse, contrasting the D2D approach with a competing approach based on
combinatorial cache design and network coded transmission from the base station
(BS) only, referred to as coded multicasting. Interestingly, the spatial reuse
gain of the former and the coded multicasting gain of the latter yield, somehow
surprisingly, the same near-optimal throughput behavior in the relevant regime
where the number of video files in the library is smaller than the number of
streaming users. Based on our recent theoretical results, we propose a holistic
D2D system design that incorporates traditional microwave (2 GHz) as well as
millimeter-wave D2D links; the direct connections to the base station can be
used to provide those rare video requests that cannot be found in local caches.
We provide extensive simulations under a variety of system settings, and
compare our scheme with other existing schemes by the BS. We show that, despite
the similar behavior of the scaling laws, the proposed D2D approach offers very
significant throughput gains with respect to the BS-only schemes.

nature of time and space reparameterizations in matter-gravity couplings, and
warn that `intrinsic' decoherence or alternative quantum theories invoking
stochastic dynamics arising from temporal or spatial fluctuations violate this
fundamental symmetry of classical general relativity. Interestingly we find
that the decoherence rate depends on extra parameters other than the Planck

the dependence of the decoherence rate of a quantum Brownian particle to the
temperature and spectral density of the environment it interacts with. The
corresponding features when gravity acts as an environment in decohering
quantum objects are what we call the `textures' of spacetime. We point out the
marked difference between the case when gravity is represented as a background
spacetime versus the case when gravity acts like a thermodynamic bath to

that the reals R under addition might be an example such that every countable

within a quasi-spherical shell. The large distance of 4.8 kpc supports the
contention that T Pyx has an extraordinarily high rate of mass transfer in
quiescence, and thus that nova explosions themselves can enhance mass loss from
a donor star, and reduce the time between eruptions in a close binary.

an on-shell diagram, how the singularities of the amplitudes are encoded in
some subspaces of the toric variety, and how this picture maps onto the

planetary mass configurations to understand the significance of each of the
giant planets. Because the outer planets modify the structure of the OC
throughout its formation, we integrate each simulation over the full age of the
Solar System. Over this time, we follow the evolution of cometary orbits from
their starting point in the protoplanetary disk to their injection into the OC
to their possible re-entry into the inner planetary region. We find that the
overall structure of the OC, including the location of boundaries and the
relative number of comets in the inner and outer parts, does not change
significantly between configurations; however, as planetary mass decreases, the
trapping efficiency (TE) of comets into the OC and the flux of comets into the
observable region increases. We determine that those comets that evolve onto
Earth-crossing orbits come primarily from the inner OC but show no preference
for initial protoplanetary disk location. We also find that systems that have
at least a Saturn-mass object are effective at deflecting possible
Earth-crossing comets but the difference in flux between systems with and
without such a planet is less than an order of magnitude. We conclude by
discussing the individual roles of the planets and the implications of
incorporating more realistic planetary accretion and migration scenarios into
simulations, particularly on existing discrepancies between low TE and the mass

use of the Spitzer/IRS MIR observations to measure the 9.8 {\mu}m silicate
absorption feature using the Spoon method and PAHFIT (as the depth of this
feature can be related to overall extinction). The silicate absorption over the
bright, southern component of IRAS 12063-6259 is almost absent while the other
methods find significant extinction. While such breakdowns of the relationship
between the NIR extinction and the 9.8 {\mu}m absorption have been observed in
molecular clouds, they have never been observed for HII regions. We then
compare the PAH intensity variations in the Spitzer/IRS data after dereddening
to those found in the original data. It was found that in most cases, the PAH
band intensity variations persist even after dereddening, implying that
extinction is not the main cause of the PAH band intensity variations.

mJy. The resulting census eliminates a longstanding bias against disks with
late-type hosts, and thereby reveals a strong correlation between L_mm and the
host spectral type. We confirm that this corresponds to a statistically robust
relationship between the masses of dust disks and the stars that host them. A
Bayesian regression technique is used to characterize these relationships: the
results indicate a typical 1.3 mm flux density of 25 mJy for solar mass hosts
and a power-law scaling L_mm \propto M_star^1.5-2.0. We suggest that a
reasonable treatment of dust temperature in the conversion from L_mm to M_disk
favors an inherently linear M_disk \propto M_star scaling, with a typical
disk-to-star mass ratio of $\sim$0.2--0.6%. The RMS dispersion around this
regression is 0.7 dex, suggesting that the combined effects of diverse
evolutionary states, dust opacities, and temperatures in these disks imprint a
FWHM range of a factor of 40 on the inferred M_disk (or L_mm) at any given host
mass. We argue that this relationship between M_disk and M_star likely
represents the origin of the inferred correlation between giant planet
frequency and host star mass in the exoplanet population, and provides some
basic support for the core accretion model for planet formation. Moreover, we
caution that selection bias must be considered in comparative studies of disk
evolution, and illustrate that fact with statistical comparisons of L_mm

during propagation, a feature that the slowly-varying envelope approximation is
unable to capture. We therefore introduce a conceptually new model, based on
the envelope of the analytic signal, that takes into account the full spectral

supermassive black hole (SMBH) influences the nuclear kinematics in both barred
and unbarred galaxies. In the presence of a bar, the increase in the velocity
dispersion $\sigma$ (within the effective radius) due to the growth of an SMBH
is on average $\lesssim 10%$, whereas the increase is only $\lesssim 4%$ in an
unbarred galaxy. In a barred galaxy, the increase results from a combination of
three separate factors (a) orientation and inclination effects; (b) angular
momentum transport by the bar that results in an increase in the central mass
density; (c) an increase in the vertical and radial velocity anisotropy of
stars in the vicinity of the SMBH. In contrast the growth of the SMBH in an
unbarred galaxy causes the velocity distribution in the inner part of the
nucleus to become less radially anisotropic. The increase in $\sigma$ following
the growth of the SMBH is insensitive to a variation of a factor of 10 in the
final mass of the SMBH, showing that it is the growth process rather than the
actual SMBH mass that alters bar evolution in a way that increases $\sigma$. We
argue that using an axisymmetric stellar dynamical modeling code to measure
SMBH masses in barred galaxies could result in a slight overestimate of the
derived $M_{BH}$, especially if a constant M/L ratio is assumed. We conclude
that the growth of a black hole in the presence of a bar could result in an
increase in $\sigma$ which is roughly of $4-8%$ larger than the increase that
occurs in an axisymmetric system. While the increase in $\sigma$ due to SMBH
growth in a barred galaxy might partially account for the claimed offset of
barred galaxies and pseudo bulges from the $M_{BH}-\sigma$ relation obtained
for elliptical galaxies and classical bulges in unbarred galaxies, it is
inadequate to account for all of the offset.

of parametric single objective problems, so-called scalarizations. If the set
of nondominated points is finite, and if an appropriate scalarization is
employed, the entire nondominated set can be generated in this way. In the
bicriteria case it is well known that this can be realized by an adaptive
approach which, given an appropriate initial search space, requires the
solution of a number of subproblems which is at most two times the number of
nondominated points. For higher dimensional problems, no linear methods were
known up to now. We present a new procedure for finding the entire nondominated
set of tricriteria optimization problems for which the number of scalarized
subproblems to be solved is at most three times the number of nondominated
points of the underlying problem. The approach includes an iterative update of
the search space that, given a (sub-)set of nondominated points, describes the
area in which additional nondominated points may be located. In particular, we
show that the number of boxes, into which the search space is decomposed,
depends linearly on the number of nondominated points.

the evaluation of the elastic and inelastic collision operators. The
computational procedure is based on the Fourier transform of the partial
elastic and inelastic collision operators and exploits the fact that these can
be written as weighted convolutions in Fourier space with no restriction on the
cross- section model. The conservation of mass, momentum and energy during
collisions is enforced through the solution of constrained optimization

Using a conservatively chosen sample of GMCs most likely to adhere to the
virial assumption, we measure cloud sizes, velocity dispersions, and $^{12}$CO
(J=1-0) luminosities and calculate cloud virial masses. The average conversion
factor from CO flux to H$_{2}$ mass (or \xcons) for each galaxy is 1-2
\xcounits, all within a factor of two of the Milky Way disk value ($\sim$2
\xcounits). We find GMCs to be generally consistent within our errors between
the galaxies and with Milky Way disk GMCs; the intrinsic scatter between clouds
is of order a factor of two. Consistent with previous studies in the Local
Group, we find a linear relationship between cloud virial mass and CO
luminosity, supporting the assumption that the clouds in this GMC sample are
gravitationally bound. We do not detect a significant population of GMCs with
elevated velocity dispersions for their sizes, as has been detected in the
Galactic center. Though the range of metallicities probed in this study is

statistically unlikely that they are effectively forbidden. Its original

same time"". The second law applies to systems composed of many particles
interacting; however, we are seeing that one can make sense of thermodynamics
in the regime where we only have a small number of particles interacting with a
heat bath. Is there a second law of thermodynamics in this regime? Here, we
find that for processes which are cyclic or very close to cyclic, the second
law for microscopic systems takes on a very different form than it does at the
macroscopic scale, imposing not just one constraint on what state
transformations are possible, but an entire family of constraints. In
particular, we find a family of free energies which generalise the traditional
one, and show that they can never increase. We further find that there are
three regimes which determine which family of second laws govern state
transitions, depending on how cyclic the process is. In one regime one can
cause an apparent violation of the usual second law, through a process of
embezzling work from a large system which remains arbitrarily close to its
original state. These second laws are not only relevant for small systems, but
also apply to individual macroscopic systems interacting via long-range
interactions, which only satisfy the ordinary second law on average. By making
precise the definition of thermal operations, the laws of thermodynamics take
on a simple form with the first law defining the class of thermal operations,
the zeroeth law emerging as a unique condition ensuring the theory is
nontrivial, and the remaining laws being a monotonicity property of our
generalised free energies.

linear dependence on the population imbalance, which is also confirmed by
Gross-Pitaevskii simulations. When introducing this dependence in the two-mode

-\mu_{ST}(I)\int_2^x\frac{dt}{\log t}\right|\ll\frac{x^{3/4}\log(N k x)}{\log
x} \] with an implied constant of $3.34$. By letting $I$ be a short interval
centered at $\frac{\pi}{2}$ and counting the primes using a smooth cutoff, we
compute a lower bound for the density of positive integers $n$ for which
$a(n)\neq0$. In particular, if $\tau$ is the Ramanujan tau function, then under
the aforementioned hypotheses, we prove that \[
\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{\#\{n\leq x:\tau(n)\neq0\}}{x}>1-1.54\times10^{-13}. \]
We also discuss the connection between the density of positive integers $n$ for
which $a(n)\neq0$ and the number of representations of $n$ by certain
positive-definite, integer-valued quadratic forms.

alone can lead to strong and reliable constraint on the HDE parameter c. At 68%
CL, we get c=0.508+-0.207 with Planck+WP+lensing, favoring the present phantom
HDE at > 2sigma CL. Comparably, by using WMAP9 alone we cannot get interesting
constraint on c. By combining Planck+WP with the BAO measurements from

further add the Planck lensing data. Compared with the WMAP9 results, the
Planck results reduce the error by 30%-60%, and prefer a phantom-like HDE at
higher CL. We find no evident tension between Planck and BAO/HST. Especially,
the strong correlation between Omegam h^3 and dark energy parameters is helpful
in relieving the tension between Planck and HST. The residual
chi^2_{Planck+WP+HST}-chi^2_{Planck+WP} is 7.8 in LCDM, and is reduced to 1.0
or 0.3 if we switch dark energy to the w model or the holographic model. We
find SNLS3 is in tension with all other data sets; for Planck+WP, WMAP9 and
BAO+HST, the corresponding Delta chi^2 is 6.4, 3.5 and 4.1, respectively.
Comparably, Union2.1 is consistent with these data sets, but the combination
Union2.1+BAO+HST is in tension with Planck+WP+lensing, corresponding to a Delta
chi^2 8.6 (1.4% probability). Thus, it is not reasonable to perform an
all-combined (CMB+SNIa+BAO+HST) analysis for HDE when using the Planck data.
Our tightest self-consistent constraint is c=0.495+-0.039 obtained from
Planck+WP+BAO+HST+lensing.

multiple, bright, and carefully studied finger-shaped outflows east and west of
its nucleus. We compare new HST images to images in the same filters observed
as much as 11 y previously to uncover large proper motions and surface
brightness changes in its multiple finger-shaped outflows. The expansion age of
the ensemble of fingers is close to 100y. We find strong brightness variations
at the fingertips during the past decade. Deep IR images reveal a multiple
ring- like structure of the surrounding medium into which the outflows
propagate and interact. Tightly constrained three-dimensional (""3D"")
hydrodynamic models link the properties of the fingers to their possible
formation histories. We incorporate previously published complementary
information to discern whether each of the fingers of CRL618 are the results of
steady, collimated outflows or a brief ejection event that launched a set of
bullets about a century ago. Finally, we argue on various physical grounds that
fingers of CRL618 are likely to be the result of a spray of clumps ejected at
the nucleus of CRL618 since any mechanism that form a sustained set of
unaligned jets is unprecedented.

observations over a wide sky area enabling detection of a large sample of
star-forming galaxies spanning 0.001<SFR(Halpha)<100 with which to robustly
measure the evolution of the SFR density in the low-z universe. The large
number of high SFR galaxies present in our sample allow an improved measurement
of the bright end of the luminosity function, indicating that the decrease in

Saunders functional form rather than the traditional Schechter function. This
result is consistent with other published luminosity functions in the FIR and

in contact with the fluid, and a thick layer which sits on top of the thin
structural layer. The fluid flow, which is driven by the time-dependent dynamic
pressure data, is governed by the 2D Navier-Stokes equations for an
incompressible, viscous fluid, defined on a 2D cylinder. The elastodynamics of
the cylinder wall is governed by the 1D linear wave equation modeling the thin
structural layer, and by the 2D equations of linear elasticity modeling the
thick structural layer. The fluid and the structure, as well as the two
structural layers, are fully coupled via the kinematic and dynamic coupling
conditions describing continuity of velocity and balance of contact forces. The
thin structural layer acts as a fluid-structure interface with mass. The
resulting FSI problem is a nonlinear moving boundary problem of
parabolic-hyperbolic type. This problem is motivated by the flow of blood in
elastic arteries whose walls are composed of several layers, each with
different mechanical characteristics and thickness. We prove existence of a
weak solution to this nonlinear FSI problem as long as the cylinder radius is

effectively prove convergence of that numerical scheme to a solution of the

fish population dynamics. Commonly used SRRs include the Ricker, Beverton-Holt,
and Cushing functional forms, which differ primarily by the degree of density
dependent effects (compensation). The degree of compensation determines whether
recruitment respectively decreases, saturates, or increases at high levels of
spawning stock biomass. In 1982 J.G. Shepherd united these dynamics into a
single model, where the degree of compensation is determined by a single
parameter, however the difficulty in relating this parameter to biological data
has limited its usefulness. Here we use a generalized modeling framework to
show that the degree of compensation can be related directly to the functional
elasticity of growth, which is a general quantity that measures the change in
recruitment relative to a change in biomass, irrespective of the specific SRR.
We show that the elasticity of growth can be calculated from short-term
fluctuations in fish biomass, is robust to observation error, and can be used
to determine general attributes of the SRR in both continuous time production
models, as well as discrete time age-structured models. This framework may be
particularly useful if fisheries time-series data are limited, and not
conducive to determining functional relationships using traditional methods of
statistical best-fit.

space, and it enables the calculation of mean values and higher-order moments
for polarization observables using simple algebraic averaging. It can be
reconstructed with the help of polarization quantum tomography and provides a
full description of the polarization properties of quantum states of light.
  We show here that, due to its definition in terms of the discrete-valued
Stokes operators, polarization quasi-probability distribution has singularities
and takes negative values at integer values of the Stokes observables. However,
in experiments with `bright' many-photon states, the photon-number resolution
is typically smeared due to the technical limitations of contemporary
photodetectors. This results in a PQPD that is positive and regular even for
such strongly nonclassical states as single-photon seeded squeezed vacuum.
  This problem can be solved by `highlighting' the quantum state, that is, by
adding a strong coherent beam into the orthogonal polarization mode. This
procedure bridges polarization quantum tomography with the Wigner-function
tomography, while preserving the main advantage of the first one, namely,
immunity to the common phase fluctuations in the light path. Thus, it provides
a convenient method for the verification of bright nonclassical states of
light, such as squeezed Fock states.

including Wiener and fractional Wiener space time white noise, homogeneous

consecutive harmonics a dc self-bias can be generated as a function of the
phase shift between the driving frequencies via the Electrical Asymmetry Effect
(EAE). Recently the Secondary Electron Asymmetry Effect (SEAE) was discovered
(T. Lafleur, P. Chabert and J.P. Booth, J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 46 135201
(2013)): unequal secondary electron emission coefficients at both electrodes
were found to induce an asymmetry in single frequency capacitive plasmas. Here,
we investigate the simultaneous presence of both effects, i.e. a dual-frequency
plasma driven by two consecutive harmonics with different electrode materials.
We find, that the superposition of the EAE and the SEAE is non-linear, i.e. the
asymmetries generated by each individual effect do not simply add up. The
control ranges of the dc self-bias and the mean ion energy can be enlarged, if
both effects are combined.

""Alexandroff Reading"", Moscow 21 - 25 May, 2012. The material presented in

the International Conference on Non-commutative Geometry, Trieste, November
2007. Progress obtained along the path of the project was reported at different
conferences in Crakovia (June 2011), ""K-Theory, C*-Algebras and Index Theory
International Conference"", Goettingen (November 2010) and Iasi (September
2011). The unifying idea behind our program is to localise K-theory and the
non-commutative geometry basic tools (Hochschild, cyclic homology and
co-homology, Connes-Karoubi Chern character) along the lines of
Alexander-Spanier co-homology and homology. The motivation for the realisation
of this programme is four-fold: -1) the classical Atiyah-Singer type index
formula is a global statement with local controle, -2) the non-localised
existing tools are not fine enough to capture sufficient information in the
case of Banach algebras, -3) one wants to make so that the Alexander-Spanier
(co)-homology becomes a natural ingredient of non-commutative geometry and -4)
the Alexander-Spanier co-homology, with respect to the existing non-commutative
geometry tools, has the advantage that it does need extra regularity beyond the
ordinary topology. Author's last reference publications represent parts of this
programme

However, information about the distribution of the lines (energy and strength)

a group of strong diffraction reflections close to the Fermi sphere is the
reason for reduction of crystal energy and stabilization of the structure. This
zone corresponds well to the 4 valence electrons in Si and Ge and leads to
assume a spd-hybridization for Bi. To explain the stabilization of this
structure within the same model in alkali metals, that are monovalent at
ambient conditions, a possibility of an overlap of the core and valence band
electrons at strong compression is considered. The assumption of the increase
in the number of valence electrons helps to understand sequences of complex
structures in compressed alkali elements and unusual changes in their physical
properties such as electrical resistance and superconductivity.

  Voevodsky's main tool in applying resolution of singularities is the cdh

presenting in this thesis a topology that we name the ldh topology, where l is

most important theorem can be rephrased as a cdh descent condition, and we are
led to ask for conditions under which certain objects in the Morel-Voevodsky
stable homotopy category satisfy ldh descent. In order to compare cdh and ldh
descent, we generalise the notion of a ""presheaf with traces"" to the concept of

have now been able to study the microbiome composition using direct sequencing,
whose output are bacterial taxa counts for each microbiome sample. One goal of
microbiome study is to associate the microbiome composition with environmental
covariates. We propose to model the taxa counts using a Dirichlet-multinomial
(DM) regression model in order to account for overdispersion of observed
counts. The DM regression model can be used for testing the association between
taxa composition and covariates using the likelihood ratio test. However, when
the number of covariates is large, multiple testing can lead to loss of power.
To address the high dimensionality of the problem, we develop a penalized
likelihood approach to estimate the regression parameters and to select the
variables by imposing a sparse group $\ell_1$ penalty to encourage both
group-level and within-group sparsity. Such a variable selection procedure can
lead to selection of the relevant covariates and their associated bacterial
taxa. An efficient block-coordinate descent algorithm is developed to solve the
optimization problem. We present extensive simulations to demonstrate that the
sparse DM regression can result in better identification of the
microbiome-associated covariates than models that ignore overdispersion or only
consider the proportions. We demonstrate the power of our method in an analysis
of a data set evaluating the effects of nutrient intake on human gut microbiome
composition. Our results have clearly shown that the nutrient intake is
strongly associated with the human gut microbiome.

observations reveal that the core possesses a distinctive structure in
polarized intensity with two maxima on axis and two minima symmetrically placed
on either side. The approximately radial pattern of electric field polarization
rods is reminiscent of the results obtained earlier by Cawthorne (2006) for
conical shocks, but, individually, these do not reproduce the main features of
the polarized intensity images. In numerical simulations and experiments, these
shocks occur in pairs and help to stabilize jets as they adjust to changes in
environment. Here, the polarization resulting from such structures is
investigated using an approximate, analytical approach, by making some simple
assumptions about the nature of the flow between two such shock waves. For
fairly small viewing angles, it is found that a reasonable representation of
the core polarization of 1803+784 can be obtained. The similarity between the
observed and model polarization supports the view that the core structure in

responsible for the first disturbance and hence brightening of the quiescent
flow in astrophysical jets.

spiral extinction features. The radial distribution of $A_V$ values declines
slowly with peaks corresponding to the spiral structures. The distribution of
$A_V$ values in the HST extinction map peaks near $A_V = 0.3-0.4$. Beyond this
point, the distribution of $A_V$ values drops like an exponential: $N(A_V) =
N_0 \times e^{(-A_V/0.5)}$. The 0.5 value is higher than typical for a spiral
galaxy. The outer arms may be tidally distended; the extinction in the
corresponding interarm regions is small to an unusually small radius.
  To analyse the PPAK IFU data, we take the ratio of a fibre spectrum in the
overlap region and the corresponding background fiber spectrum to construct an
extinction curve. We fit the Cardelli, Clayton and Mathis (CCM) curve to the
extinction curve of each fiber element in the overlap region. A map of the
extinction constructed from PPEX IFU data-cubes shows the same spiral structure
of the HST extinction map but the some differences in the distribution of the
normalization of the CCM fits ($A_V$). The inferred extinction slopes ($R_V$)
maps do not display any structure and a range of values partly due to the
sampling effects of the disc by fibers, sometimes due to bad fits, and possibly
partly due to some reprocessing of dust grains in the interacting disc.

This provides a
system of categories of complexes of motivic sheaves with integral coefficients
which is closed under the six operations of Grothendieck. The rational part of
these categories coincides with the triangulated categories of Beilinson
motives (and is thus strongly related to algebraic $K$-theory). We extend the
rigity theorem of Suslin and Voevodsky over a general base scheme. This can be
reformulated by saying that torsion etale motives essentially coincide with the
usual complexes of torsion etale sheaves (at least if we restrict ourselves to
torsion prime to the residue characteristics). As a consequence, we obtain the
expected results of absolute purity, of finiteness, and of Grothendieck duality
for etale motives with integral coefficients, by putting together their
counterparts for Beilinson motives and for torsion etale sheaves. Following
Thomason's insights, this also provides a conceptual and convenient
construction of the $\ell$-adic realization of motives, as the homotopy
$\ell$-completion functor.

heritability of human phenotypes is the adoption of linear mixed-effects models
(LMMs) to estimate heritability due to genetic variants which are not
significantly associated with the phenotype. A variant of the LMM approach has
been adapted to case-control studies and applied to many major diseases by Lee
et al. (2011), successfully accounting for a considerable portion of the
missing heritability. For example, for Crohn's disease their estimated
heritability was 22% compared to 50-60% from family studies. In this letter we
propose to estimate heritability of disease directly by regression of phenotype
similarities on genotype correlations, corrected to account for ascertainment.
We refer to this method as genetic correlation regression (GCR). Using GCR we
estimate the heritability of Crohn's disease at 34% using the same data. We
demonstrate through extensive simulation that our method yields unbiased
heritability estimates, which are consistently higher than LMM estimates.
Moreover, we develop a heuristic correction to LMM estimates, which can be
applied to published LMM results. Applying our heuristic correction increases
the estimated heritability of multiple sclerosis from 30% to 52.6%.

and form a bound binary at parsec or sub-parsec scales. These scales are
unresolved even in nearby galaxies, and thus detection of non-active black hole
binaries must rely on stellar dynamics. Here we show that these systems could
be indirectly detected through the trail that the black holes leave as they
spiral inwards. We analyze two numerical simulations of inspiralling black
holes (equal masses and 10:1 mass ratio) in the stellar environment of a
galactic centre. We studied the effect of the binary on the structure of the
stellar population, with particular emphasis on projected kinematics and
directly measurable moments of the velocity distribution. We present those
moments as high-resolution 2D maps. As shown in past scattering experiments, a
torus of stars counter-rotating with respect to the black holes exists in
scales ~ 5 to 10 times larger than the binary separation. While this is seen in
the average velocity map in the unequal mass case, it is obscured by a more
strongly co-rotating outer region in the equal mass case; however, the inner
counter-rotation could still be detected by studying the higher moments of the
velocity distribution. Additionally, the maps reveal a dip in velocity
dispersion in the inner region, as well as more pronounced signatures in the
higher distribution moments. These maps could serve as templates for integral
field spectroscopy observations of nearby galactic centres. The discovery of
such signatures may help census the population of supermassive black hole

be described both in the frame of the phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory

the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction. Recent progress in quantum
first-principal methods allows to calculate interatomic bond parameters of the
Heisenberg model, namely, isotropic exchange constants $J_{ij}$ and DM vectors
$\mathbf{D}_{ij}$, which can be used for simulations of observed magnetic
textures and comparison of their calculated characteristics, such as magnetic
helix sense and pitch, with the experimental data. In the present work, it is
found that unaveraged microscopical details of the spin structures (the local
canting) have a strong impact on the global twist and can notably change the
helix propagation number. Coefficients ${\cal J}$ and ${\cal D}$ of the
phenomenological theory and helix propagation number $k={\cal D}/2{\cal J}$ are
derived from interatomic parameters $J_{ij}$ and $\mathbf{D}_{ij}$ of

Apparent randomness
can result both from ignorance or lack of control of degrees of freedom in the

quantum systems are believed to exhibit some intrinsic randomness. In general,
any observed random process includes both forms of randomness. In this work, we
provide quantum processes in which all the observed randomness is fully
intrinsic. These results are derived under minimal assumptions: the validity of
the no-signalling principle and an arbitrary (but not absolute) lack of freedom
of choice. The observed randomness tends to a perfect random bit when
increasing the number of parties, thus defining an explicit process attaining

investigated. Viscous evolution of a disk around a single star is considered
with a model where a disk increases its mass by dynamically accreting envelope
and simultaneously loses its mass via viscous accretion onto the central star.
We focus on the circumstellar disk with high mass accretion rate onto the disk
$\dot{M}=8.512c_{\rm s}^3/G$ as a result of dynamical collapse of rotating
molecular cloud core. We study the origin of the surface density distribution
and the origin of the disk-to-star mass ratio by means of numerical
calculations of unsteady viscous accretion disk in one-dimensional axisymmetric
model. It is shown that the radial profiles of the surface density $\Sigma$,
azimuthal velocity $v_{\phi}$, and mass accretion rate $\dot{M}$ in the inner
region approach to the quasi-steady state. Profile of the surface density
distribution in the quasi-steady state is determined as a result of angular
momentum transport rather than its original distribution of angular momentum in
the cloud core. It is also shown that the disk mass becomes larger than the
central star in the long time limit as long as temporary constant mass flux
onto the disk is assumed. After the mass infall rate onto the disk declines
owing to the depletion of the parent cloud core, the disk-to-star mass ratio
$M_{\rm disk}/M_*$ decreases. The disk-to-star mass ratio becomes smaller than
unity after $t> 10^5 \rm yr$ and $t>10^6 \rm yr$ from the beginning of the
accretion phase in the case with $\alpha_0 =1 {\rm and} 0.1$, respectively,
where $\alpha_0 $ is the constant part of viscous parameter. In the case with

one is of the form: a convex set C is approachable if and only if it intersects

shortcomings as the so called r - K formulation of logistic equation diverges

models, although it shows similar complexity in terms of fixed points and

rates involved in field campaigns. We perform an analytical stability analysis

interaction scenarios including tests of the resilience of its dynamics under

are thought to bridge the gap between the two families of high temperature
superconductors7,15,16, but long-ranged AFM order was not successfully
suppressed via chemical doping in these investigations. Here we report the
first observation of the pressure-induced elimination of long-ranged AFM order
in LaMnPO single crystals that are iso-structural to the LaFeAsO
superconductor15,17. By combining in-situ high pressure resistance and ac
susceptibility measurements, we found that LaMnPO undergoes a crossover from an
AFM insulating to an AFM metallic state at a pressure ~20 GPa and that the
long-ranged AFM order collapses at a higher pressure ~32 GPa. Our findings are
of importance to explore potential superconductivity in Mn-based compounds and
to shed new light on the underlying mechanism of high temperature

  In this paper, we give a simple proof of a strengthening of the relative

task, especially when modelling small-area disease incidence data in an
ecological study design. The challenge comes from the unobserved underlying
spatial correlation structure in these data, which is accounted for using
random effects modelled by a globally smooth conditional autoregressive model.
These smooth random effects confound the effects of air pollution, which are
also globally smooth. To avoid this collinearity a Bayesian localised
conditional autoregressive model is developed for the random effects. This
localised model is flexible spatially, in the sense that it is not only able to
model step changes in the random effects surface, but also is able to capture
areas of spatial smoothness in the study region. This methodological
development allows us to improve the estimation performance of the covariate
effects, compared to using traditional conditional auto-regressive models.
These results are established using a simulation study, and are then
illustrated with our motivating study on air pollution and respiratory ill
health in Greater Glasgow, Scotland in 2010. The model shows substantial health
effects of particulate matter air pollution and income deprivation, whose

heavy-ion collisions, dilepton measurements play an essential role. Leptons,
when compared to hadrons, have only little interaction with the strongly
interacting system. Thus, dileptons provide ideal penetrating probes that allow
the study of such a system throughout its space-time evolution. In the low mass
range ($M_{ll}<1.1$ GeV/$c^2$), the dominant source of dileptons originates
from the decay of vector mesons which may see effects from chiral symmetry
restoration. In the intermediate mass range ($1.1<M_{ll}<3.0 $ GeV/$c^2$), the
main contributions to the mass spectrum are expected to originate from the
thermal radiation of a quark-gluon plasma as well as the decays of charm
mesons. In the high mass range ($M_{ll}>3.0$ GeV/$c^2$), dilepton measurements
are expected to see contributions from primordial processes involving heavy
quarks, and Drell-Yan production.
  With the introduction of the Time-of-Flight detector, the STAR detector has
been able to perform large acceptance, high purity electron identification. In
this contribution, we will present STAR's recent dielectron measurements in the
low and intermediate mass range for RHIC beam energies ranging between 19.6 and
200 GeV. Compared to electrons, muon measurements have the advantage of reduced
bremsstrahlung radiation in the surrounding detector materials. With the
upcoming detector upgrades, specifically the muon detector (MTD), STAR will be
able to include such measurements in its (di-)lepton studies. We will discuss
the future dilepton program at STAR and the physics cases for these upgrades.

The combined action of both forces, that act homogeneously on the granular gas,
tries to mimic the interaction of the set of particles with a surrounding
fluid. The first stochastic force thermalizes the system, providing for the
necessary energy recovery to keep the system in its gas state at all times,
whereas the second force allows us to mimic the action of the surrounding fluid
viscosity. After a transient regime, the gas reaches a steady state
characterized by a \emph{scaled} distribution function $\varphi$ that does not
only depend on the dimensionless velocity $\mathbf{c}\equiv \mathbf{v}/v_0$

exploit all their resonant mode richness. These multilayer structures are based
on a cylindrical distribution of radially dependent constitutive parameters
including an inner void cavity. Shell, cavity and whispering gallery modes are
characterized, and special attention is paid to the latter ones. The whispering
gallery modes are created at the boundary layers of the shell with the
background and energy localization is produced with highly radiative
characteristics. These low-Q resonant states have frequencies that are
independent of the shell thickness. However, their quality factors can be
controlled by the number of layers forming the shell, which allows confining
electromagnetic waves at the interface layers (internal or external), and make
them suitable for the harvesting of electromagnetic energy.

operating the cantilever in nonlinear regime is then illustrated through
examples of bifurcation based mass sensors and electromechanical coupling based
Flexure-FET biosensors. We believe that a new class of nonlinear sensors, with

Local Lorentz Invariance (LLI) and on the formalism of the Deformed Special

Quantum Mechanics, beside being an axiomatic theory, can be considered also a
deductive physical theory, deducted from the primary physical principle of
Relativistic Correlation. This principle is synonym of LLI and of a rigid and
at minkowskian space-time. The results of the experiments mentioned above show
the breakdown of LLI and hence the violation of the principle of Relativistic
Correlation. The formalism of DSR allows to highlight the deep meaning of LLI
breakdown in terms of the geometrical structure of local space-time which, far
from being rigid and at, is deformed by the energy of the physical phenomena
that take place and in this sense it has an active part in the dynamics of the
whole physical process. This perspective has a far reaching physical meaning
that extends its consequences to the foundations of Quantum Mechanics according
to the interpretation of Copenhagen. It provides a 'real' explanation and
description of quantum phenomena enriching, by the concept of deformed
space-time, the realistic interpretation in terms of pilot wave and hence it
uncovers the reality hidden below the probabilistic interpretation and
dualistic nature of quantum objects.

  Sitbon","A probabilistic framework for analysing the compositionality of
  conceptual combinations","Revisions (Journal of Mathematical Psychology)",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Conceptual combination performs a fundamental role in creating the broad
range of compound phrases utilized in everyday language. This article provides
a novel probabilistic framework for assessing whether the semantics of
conceptual combinations are compositional, and so can be considered as a
function of the semantics of the constituent concepts, or not. While the
systematicity and productivity of language provide a strong argument in favor
of assuming compositionality, this very assumption is still regularly
questioned in both cognitive science and philosophy. Additionally, the
principle of semantic compositionality is underspecified, which means that
notions of both ""strong"" and ""weak"" compositionality appear in the literature.
Rather than adjudicating between different grades of compositionality, the
framework presented here contributes formal methods for determining a clear
dividing line between compositional and non-compositional semantics. In
addition, we suggest that the distinction between these is contextually
sensitive. Utilizing formal frameworks developed for analyzing composite
systems in quantum theory, we present two methods that allow the semantics of
conceptual combinations to be classified as ""compositional"" or
""non-compositional"". Compositionality is first formalised by factorising the
joint probability distribution modeling the combination, where the terms in the
factorisation correspond to individual concepts. This leads to the necessary
and sufficient condition for the joint probability distribution to exist. A
failure to meet this condition implies that the underlying concepts cannot be
modeled in a single probability space when considering their combination, and
the combination is thus deemed ""non-compositional"". The formal analysis methods
are demonstrated by applying them to an empirical study of twenty-four
non-lexicalised conceptual combinations.

magnetic field is reported with exact analytical calculations based on a Landau
Level (LL) picture, by serious consideration of the finite thickness of the
Quantum Well (QW). The approach is physically transparent and subtly different
in its line of reasoning from standard methods avoiding any semi-classical
approximation. We find ""internal"" phase transitions (at partial LL filling) for
magnetisation and susceptibility that are not captured by other approaches and
that give rise to nontrivial violations of the standard de Haas-van Alphen
periods, in a manner that reproduces the exact quantal astrophysical behaviours
in the limit of full three-dimensional (3D) space. Upon inclusion of Zeeman
splitting, additional features are also found, such as global energy minima
originating from the interplay of QW, Zeeman and LL Physics, while a
corresponding calculation in a Composite Fermion picture with {\Lambda}-Levels,
leads to new predictions on magnetic properties of an interacting electron
liquid. By pursuing the same line of reasoning for a topologically nontrivial
system with a relativistic spectrum, we find evidence that similar effects
might be operative in the dimensionality crossover of 3D strong topological
insulators to 2D topological insulator quantum wells.

$(\epsilon_i)_{i=1}^{\infty}\in\{0,1\}^{\mathbb{N}}$ is an expansion of $x$ in
base $q$ (or a $q$-expansion) if x=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\epsilon_iq^{-i}. Let
$\mathcal{B}_{\aleph_{0}}$ denote the set of $q$ for which there exists $x$
with exactly $\aleph_{0}$ expansions in base $q$. In \cite{EHJ} it was shown
that $\min\mathcal{B}_{\aleph_{0}}=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}.$ In this paper we show
that the smallest element of $\mathcal{B}_{\aleph_{0}}$ strictly greater than
$\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$ is $q_{\aleph_{0}}\approx1.64541$, the appropriate root
of $x^6=x^4+x^3+2x^2+x+1$. This leads to a full dichotomy for the number of
possible $q$-expansions for $q\in (\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2},q_{\aleph_{0}})$. We
also prove some general results regarding
$\mathcal{B}_{\aleph_{0}}\cap[\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2},q_{f}],$ where $q_{f}\approx
1.75488$ is the appropriate root of $x^{3}=2x^{2}-x+1.$ Moreover, the
techniques developed in this paper imply that if $x\in [0,\frac{1}{q-1}]$ has
uncountably many $q$-expansions then the set of $q$-expansions for $x$ has
cardinality equal to that of the continuum, this proves that the continuum
hypothesis holds when restricted to this specific case.

classical geometry of a black hole and remove the curvature singularity, the
black hole would not evaporate entirely but approach a remnant. In a modified
Schwarzschild spacetime characterized by a finite Kretschmann scalar, a minimal
mass of the black hole is naturally bounded by the existence of the horizon
rather than introduced by hand. A thermodynamical analysis discloses that the
temperature, heat capacity and the luminosity are vanishing naturally when the
black hole mass approaches the minimal value. This phenomenon may be attributed
to the existence of the minimal length in quantum gravity. It can also be
understood heuristically by connecting the generalized uncertainty principle
with the running of Newton's gravitational constant.

4f-electrons. We give evidence, based on electrical resistivity measurements of
dilute Y(Gd) and Y(Tb) alloys to 120 GPa, that the volume collapse transitions
in Gd and Tb metals have different origins, despite their being neighbors in
the periodic table. Remarkably, the change under pressure in the magnetic state
of isolated Pr or Tb impurity ions in the nonmagnetic Y host appears to closely
mirror corresponding changes in pure Pr or Tb metals. The collapse in Tb
appears to be driven by an enhanced negative exchange interaction between 4f
and conduction electrons under pressure (Kondo resonance) which, in the case of
Y(Tb), dramatically alters the superconducting properties of the Y host, much
like previously found for Y(Pr). In Gd our resistivity measurements suggest
that a Kondo resonance is not the main driver for its volume collapse. X-ray
absorption and emission spectroscopies clearly show that 4f local moments
remain largely intact across both volume collapse transitions ruling out 4f
band formation (delocalization) and valence transition models as possible
drivers. The results highlight the richness of behavior behind the volume
collapse transition in lanthanides and demonstrate the stability of the 4f
level against band formation to extreme pressure.

few of them whose radius and mass have been measured already reveal a diversity
in composition. Some of these exoplanets are found on eccentric orbits and are
subjected to strong tides affecting their rotation and resulting in significant
tidal heating. Within this population, some planets are likely to be depleted
in volatiles and have no atmosphere. We model the thermal emission of these
""Super Mercuries"" to study the signatures of rotation and tidal dissipation on
their infrared light curve. We compute the time-dependent temperature map at
the surface and in the subsurface of the planet and the resulting
disk-integrated emission spectrum received by a distant observer for any
observation geometry. We calculate the illumination of the planetary surface
for any Keplerian orbit and rotation. We include the internal tidal heat flow,
vertical heat diffusion in the subsurface and generate synthetic light curves.
We show that the different rotation periods predicted by tidal models
(spin-orbit resonances, pseudo-synchronization) produce different photometric
signatures, which are observable provided that the thermal inertia of the
surface is high, like that of solid or melted rocks (but not regolith). Tidal
dissipation can also directly affect the light curves and make the inference of
the rotation more difficult or easier depending on the existence of hot spots
on the surface. Infrared light curve measurement with the James Webb Space
Telescope and EChO can be used to infer exoplanets' rotation periods and
dissipation rates and thus to test tidal models. This data will also constrain
the nature of the (sub)surface by constraining the thermal inertia.

gasoline and other car-related costs, while at the same time it can reduce
traffic and pollution. This paper assesses the potential of ride-sharing for
reducing traffic in a city, based on mobility data extracted from 3G Call
Description Records (CDRs, for the cities of Barcelona and Madrid) and from
Online Social Networks (Twitter, collected for the cities of New York and Los
Angeles). We first analyze these data sets to understand mobility patterns,
home and work locations, and social ties between users. We then develop an
efficient algorithm for matching users with similar mobility patterns,
considering a range of constraints. The solution provides an upper bound to the
potential reduction of cars in a city that can be achieved by ride-sharing. We
use our framework to understand the different constraints and city
characteristics on this potential benefit. For example, our study shows that
traffic in the city of Madrid can be reduced by 59% if users are willing to
share a ride with people who live and work within 1 km; if they can only accept
a pick-up and drop-off delay up to 10 minutes, this potential benefit drops to
24%; if drivers also pick up passengers along the way, this number increases to
53%. If users are willing to ride only with people they know (""friends"" in the

they are willing to ride with friends of friends, the potential reduction is up

matter and angular momentum from the companion star and be spun-up to
millisecond rotational periods. During the accretion stage, the system is
called a low-mass X-ray binary, and bright X-ray emission is observed. When the
rate of mass transfer decreases in the later evolutionary stages, these
binaries host a radio millisecond pulsar whose emission is powered by the
neutron star's rotating magnetic field. This evolutionary model is supported by
the detection of millisecond X-ray pulsations from several accreting neutron
stars and also by the evidence for a past accretion disc in a rotation-powered
millisecond pulsar. It has been proposed that a rotation-powered pulsar may
temporarily switch on during periods of low mass inflow in some such systems.
Only indirect evidence for this transition has hitherto been observed. Here we
report observations of accretion-powered, millisecond X-ray pulsations from a
neutron star previously seen as a rotation-powered radio pulsar. Within a few
days after a month-long X-ray outburst, radio pulses were again detected. This
not only shows the evolutionary link between accretion and rotation-powered
millisecond pulsars, but also that some systems can swing between the two
states on very short timescales.

of polygonal approximation, two fundamental problems have been addressed.
First, the nature of the performance evaluation metrics in relation to the
local and global fitting characteristics has been studied. Second, an explicit
error bound of the error introduced by digitizing a continuous line segment has
been derived and used to propose a generic non-heuristic parameter independent
framework which can be used in several dominant point detection methods. For
the problem of tangent estimation for digital curves, a simple method of

that the method performs better than almost all (seventy two) existing tangent
estimation methods for conic as well as several non-conic digital curves. For
the problem of fitting ellipses on digital curves, a geometric distance

transiting planet in a 3.6-day orbit around a metal-rich solar-like star. We
combined the publicly available Kepler photometry (quarters 1-13) with
high-resolution spectroscopy from the Sandiford@McDonald and FIES@NOT
spectrographs. We derived the system parameters via a simultaneous joint fit to
the photometric and radial velocity measurements. Our analysis is based on the
Bayesian approach and is carried out by sampling the parameter posterior
distributions using a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. Kepler-77b is a
moderately inflated planet with a mass of Mp=0.430+/-0.032 Mjup, a radius of
Rp=0.960+/-0.016 Rjup, and a bulk density of 0.603+/-0.055 g/cm^3. It orbits a
slowly rotating (P=36+/-6 days) G5V star with M*=0.95+/-0.04 Msun,
R*=0.99+/-0.02 Rsun, Teff=5520+/-60 K, [M/H]=0.20+/-0.05, that has an age of
7.5+/-2.0 Gyr. The lack of detectable planetary occultation with a depth higher
than about 10 ppm implies a planet geometric and Bond albedo of
Ag<0.087+/-0.008 and Ab<0.058+/-0.006, respectively, placing Kepler-77b among
the gas-giant planets with the lowest albedo known so far. We found neither
additional planetary transit signals nor transit-timing variations at a level
of about 0.5 minutes, in accordance with the trend that close-in gas giant
planets seem to belong to single-planet systems. The 106 transits observed in
short-cadence mode by Kepler for nearly 1.2 years show no detectable signatures
of the planet's passage in front of starspots. We explored the implications of
the absence of detectable spot-crossing events for the inclination of the
stellar spin-axis, the sky-projected spin-orbit obliquity, and the latitude of
magnetically active regions.

$\tM$, usually taken to be $(\RR, +)$ or $(\QQ, +)$. Although a rich theory has
arisen from this viewpoint, cf. [L1], idempotent semirings possess a restricted
algebraic structure theory, and also do not reflect certain valuation-theoretic
properties, thereby forcing researchers to rely often on combinatoric
techniques.
  In this paper we describe an alternative structure, more compatible with
valuation theory, studied by the authors over the past few years, that permits
fuller use of algebraic theory especially in understanding the underlying
tropical geometry. The idempotent max-plus algebra $A$ of an ordered monoid
$\tM$ is replaced by $R: = L\times \tM$, where $L$ is a given indexing semiring
(not necessarily with 0). In this case we say $R$ layered by $L$. When $L$ is
trivial, i.e, $L=\{1\}$, $R$ is the usual bipotent max-plus algebra. When
$L=\{1,\infty\}$ we recover the ""standard"" supertropical structure with its
""ghost"" layer. When $L = \NN $ we can describe multiple roots of polynomials
via a ""layering function"" $s: R \to L$. Likewise, one can define the layering
$s: R^{(n)} \to L^{(n)}$ componentwise; vectors $v_1, \dots, v_m$ are called
tropically dependent if each component of some nontrivial linear combination
$\sum \a_i v_i$ is a ghost, for ""tangible"" $\a_i \in R$. Then an $n\times n$
matrix has tropically dependent rows iff its permanent is a ghost.
  We explain how supertropical algebras, and more generally layered algebras,
provide a robust algebraic foundation for tropical linear algebra, in which
many classical tools are available. In the process, we provide some new results
concerning the rank of d-independent sets (such as the fact that they are
semi-additive),put them in the context of supertropical bilinear forms, and lay
the matrix theory in the framework of identities of semirings.

models is the bosonization in meson and diquark channels. This procedure is
presented at finite temperatures and chemical potentials for the SU(2) flavor
case of the NJL model with special emphasis on the mixing between scalar meson
and scalar diquark modes which occurs in the 2SC color superconducting phase.
The thermodynamic potential is obtained in the gaussian approximation for the
meson and diquark fields and it is given the Beth-Uhlenbeck form. This allows a
detailed discussion of bound state dissociation in hot, dense matter (Mott
effect) in terms of the in-medium scattering phase shift of two-particle
correlations. It is shown for the case without meson-diquark mixing that the
phase shift can be separated into a continuum and a resonance part. In the
latter, the Mott transition manifests itself by a change of the phase shift at
threshold by \pi\ in accordance with Levinson's theorem, when a bound state
transforms to a resonance in the scattering continuum. The consequences for the
contribution of pionic correlations to the pressure are discussed by evaluating
the Beth-Uhlenbeck equation of state in different approximations. A similar
discussion is performed for the scalar diquark channel in the normal phase.
Further developments and applications of the developed approach are outlined.

important to assess the viability of QZ Nor, V340 Nor, and GU Nor as
calibrators for Leavitt's law via their purported membership in the open
cluster NGC 6067. The following suite of evidence confirms that QZ Nor and V340
Nor are members of NGC 6067, whereas GU Nor likely lies in the foreground: (i)
existing radial velocities for QZ Nor and V340 Nor agree with that established
for the cluster (-39.4+-1.2 km/s) to within 1 km/s, whereas GU Nor exhibits a
markedly smaller value; (ii) a steep velocity-distance gradient characterizes
the sight-line toward NGC 6067, thus implying that objects sharing common
velocities are nearly equidistant; (iii) a radial profile constructed for NGC
6067 indicates that QZ Nor is within the cluster bounds, despite being 20' from
the cluster center; (iv) new BVJH photometry for NGC 6067 confirms the cluster
lies d=1.75+-0.10 kpc distant, a result that matches Wesenheit distances
computed for QZ Nor/V340 Nor using the Benedict et al. (2007, HST parallaxes)
calibration. QZ Nor is a cluster Cepheid that should be employed as a
calibrator for the cosmic distance scale.

E-CDF-S. We test the previously reported dependence between Gamma and black

range in these parameters based on both the Mg ii and H-alpha emission lines
with the later afforded by recent near infrared spectroscopic observations
using Subaru/FMOS. We calculate the Eddington ratios, lambda_Edd, for sources
where a bolometric luminosity (L_Bol) has been presented in the literature,
based on SED fitting, or, for sources where these data do not exist, we
calculate L_Bol using a bolometric correction to the LX, derived from a
relationship between the bolometric correction, and LX/L3000. From a sample of
69 X-ray bright sources (>250 counts), where Gamma can be measured with
greatest precision, with an estimate of L_Bol, we find a statistically
significant correlation between Gamma and lambda_Edd, which is highly
significant with a chance probability of 6.59x10^-8. A statistically
significant correlation between Gamma and the FWHM of the optical lines is
confirmed, but at lower significance than with lambda_Edd indicating that
lambda_Edd is the key parameter driving conditions in the corona. Linear

As long as the dimension of the perturbing operator remains very close to
marginal (even for large couplings) a stable minimum at hierarchically small
scales is achieved, where the dilaton mass squared is suppressed by epsilon. At
the same time the cosmological constant in this sector is also suppressed by
epsilon, and thus parametrically smaller than in a broken SUSY theory. As a
byproduct we also present an exact solution to the scalar-gravity system that
can be interpreted as a new holographic realization of spontaneously broken
conformal symmetry. Even though this metric deviates substantially from AdS
space in the deep IR it still describes a non-linearly realized exactly
conformal theory. We also display the effective potential for the dilaton for

to measure the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ accurately to constrain inflation

analysis is usually done by assuming an instantaneous reionization $X_{e}(z)$
which, however, can bias the best-fit value of $r$. Moreover, due to the strong
mixing of B-mode and E-mode polarizations in cut-sky measurements, multiplying
the sky coverage fraction $f_{sky}$ by the full-sky likelihood would not give
satisfactory results. In this work, we forecast constraints on $r$ for the
Planck mission taking into account the general reionization scenario and
cut-sky effects. Our results show that by applying an N-point interpolation
analysis to the reionization history, the bias induced by the assumption of

within $5\%$ error level, if the true value of $r$ is greater than about 0.1 .

cools and flows toward the centre, now they are believed to be very dynamic
places where heating from the central Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) and
cooling, as inferred from active star formation, molecular gas, and Halpha
nebulosity, find an uneasy energetic balance. (Aims) We want to characterize
the X-ray properties of the nearby cool-core cluster Zw1742+3306, selected
because it is bright at X-ray (with a flux greater than 1e-11 erg/s/cm2 in the
0.1-2.4 keV band) and Halpha wavelengths (Halpha luminosity > 1e40 erg/s).
(Methods) We used Chandra data to analyze the spatial and spectral properties
of the cool core of Zw1742+3306, a galaxy cluster at z=0.0757 that emits in
Halpha and presents the brightest central galaxy located in a diffuse X-ray
emission with multiple peaks in surface brightness. (Results) We show that the
X-ray cool core of the galaxy cluster Zw1742+3306 is thermodynamically very
active with evidence of cold fronts and a weak shock in the surface brightness
map and of an apparently coherent, elongated structure with metallicity greater
than the value measured in the surrounding ambient gas by about 50 per cent.
This anisotropic structure is 280 x 90 kpc2 and is aligned with the cold fronts
and with the X-ray emission on larger scales. We suggest that all these
peculiarities in the X-ray emission of Zw1742+3306 are either a very fine-tuned
output of a sloshing gas in the cluster core or the product of a metal-rich
outflow from the central AGN.

to reconstruct the underlying source with minimum mean squared error. The
scenario of interest here is one where some of the sensors act as adversary
(jammer): they strive to maximize distortion. We show that the ability of
transmitter sensors to secretly agree on a random event, that is
""coordination"", plays a key role in the analysis. Depending on the coordination
capability of sensors and the receiver, we consider two problem settings. The
first setting involves transmitters with coordination capabilities in the sense
that all transmitters can use identical realization of randomized encoding for
each transmission. In this case, the optimal strategy for the adversary sensors
also requires coordination, where they all generate the same realization of
independent and identically distributed Gaussian noise. In the second setting,
the transmitter sensors are restricted to use fixed, deterministic encoders and
this setting, which corresponds to a Stackelberg game, does not admit a
saddle-point solution. We show that the the optimal strategy for all sensors is
uncoded communications where encoding functions of adversaries and transmitters
are in opposite directions. For both settings, digital compression and

a cyclical order of the variables and chooses the next pivot variable starting
from the previously chosen variable and proceeding in the given circular order.
It is perhaps the simplest example from the class of history-based pivot rules.
Our results are based on a new lower bound construction for parity games. Due
to the nature of the construction we are also able to obtain an exponential

also called the intermediate scattering function, from the point of view of the
vibration-transit (V-T) theory of monatomic liquid dynamics. A similar study
has been reported for the self part, and we study the self and distinct parts
separately because their damping processes are not simply related. We begin
with the perfect vibrational system, which provides precise definitions of the
liquid correlations, and provides the vibrational approximation Fdvib(q,t) at
all q and t. Two independent liquid correlations are defined, motional and
structural, and these are decorrelated sequentially, with a crossover time
tc(q). This is done by two independent decorrelation processes: the first,
vibrational dephasing, is naturally present in Fdvib(q,t) and operates to damp
the motional correlation; the second, transit-induced decorrelation, is invoked
to enhance the damping of motional correlation, and then to damp the structural
correlation. A microscopic model is made for the ""transit drift"", the averaged
transit motion that damps motional correlation on 0 < t < tc(q). Following the
previously developed self-decorrelation theory, a microscopic model is also
made for the ""transit random walk,"" which damps the structural correlation on t
> tc(q). The complete model incorporates a property common to both self and
distinct decorrelation: simple exponential decay following a delay period,
where the delay is tc(q, the time required for the random walk to emerge from
the drift. Our final result is an accurate expression for Fd(q,t) for all q
through the first peak in Sd(q). The theory is calibrated and tested using
molecular dynamics (MD) calculations for liquid Na at 395K; however, the theory
itself does not depend on MD, and we consider other means for calibrating it.

high-SE-with-low-EE for rate-limited systems and high-EE-with-low-SE for
energy-limited systems. For the SE-EE tradeoff improvement, we propose a PA
switching (PAS) technique. In a PAS transmitter, one or more PAs are switched
on intermittently to maximize the EE and deliver an overall required SE. As a
consequence, a high EE over a wide range SE can be achieved, which is verified
by numerical evaluations: with 15% SE reduction for low SE demand, the PAS
between a low power PA and a high power PA can improve EE by 323%, while a

rotation. The rotation rate at the solar Equator seems to decrease since cycle
10 onwards. The coefficient $B$ of solar differential rotation, which
represents the latitudinal gradient of rotation, is found smaller in the
several years after the minimum of a solar cycle than in the several years
after the maximum time of the cycle, and it peaks several years after the
maximum time of the solar cycle. The internal-cycle variation of the solar
rotation rates looks similar in profile to that of the coefficient $B$. A new
explanation is proposed to address such a solar-cycle related variation of the
solar rotation rates. Weak magnetic fields may more effectively reflect
differentiation at low latitudes with high rotation rates than at high
latitudes with low rotation rates, and strong magnetic fields may more
effectively repress differentiation at relatively low latitudes than at high
latitudes. The internal-cycle variation is inferred to the result of both the
latitudinal migration of the surface torsional pattern and the repression of
strong magnetic activity to differentiation.

off the histone octamer surface due to thermal fluctuations or the action of
chromatin remodeling enzymes. Partial DNA unwrapping enables easier access of
DNA-binding factors to their target sites and thus may provide a dominant
pathway for effecting rapid and robust access to DNA packaged into chromatin.
Indeed, a recent high-resolution map of distances between neighboring
nucleosome dyads in \emph{S.cerevisiae} shows that at least 38.7\% of all
nucleosomes are partially unwrapped. The extent of unwrapping follows a
stereotypical pattern in the vicinity of genes, reminiscent of the canonical
pattern of nucleosome occupancy in which nucleosomes are depleted over
promoters and well-positioned over coding regions. To explain these
observations, we developed a biophysical model which employs a 10-11 base pair
periodic nucleosome energy profile. The profile, based on the pattern of
histone-DNA contacts in nucleosome crystal structures and the idea of linker
length discretization, accounts for both nucleosome unwrapping and higher-order
chromatin structure. Our model reproduces the observed genome-wide distribution
of inter-dyad distances, and accounts for patterns of nucleosome occupancy and
unwrapping around coding regions. At the same time, our approach explains
\emph{in vitro} measurements of accessibility of nucleosome-covered binding
sites, and of nucleosome-induced cooperativity between DNA-binding factors. We
are able to rule out several alternative scenarios of nucleosome unwrapping as
inconsistent with the genomic data.

between the current-flowing metastable state (that reduces to the ground state
for sufficiently slowly-moving potential) and the first excited state vanishes
when the moving velocity $v$ of the potential approaches a critical velocity
v_c(>0). We find a scaling law $\Delta \propto (1-|v|/v_c)^{1/4}$, which
implies that a characteristic time scale diverges toward the critical velocity.
Near the critical velocity, we show that low-energy local density fluctuations
are enhanced. These behaviors can be regarded as precursor phenomena of the
vortex nucleation.

within binary systems in a disc of stars around Sgr A* over the last 100 Myr.
Monte Carlo simulations show that the rate of binary disruption is ~10^-4
yr^-1, comparable to that of tidal disruption models. The supernova-induced HVS
production rate (\Gamma_HVS) is significantly increased if the binaries are
hardened via migration through a gaseous disc. Moderate hardening gives
\Gamma_HVS ~ 2*10^-7 yr^-1 and an estimated population of ~20 HVSs in the last
100 Myr. Supernova-induced HVS production requires the internal and external
orbital velocity vectors of the secondary binary component to be aligned when
the binary is disrupted. This leaves an imprint of the disc geometry on the
spatial distribution of the HVSs, producing a distinct anisotropy.

the need for an additional far-infrared (FIR) component besides the emission
from a dusty AGN-powered torus. This additional FIR component has temperatures
of T_FIR ~ 40-60K with luminosities of L_(8-1000mu) ~ 10^13 L_sun (accounting
for 25-60% of the bolometric FIR luminosity). If the FIR dust emission is due
to star formation it would suggest star formation rates in excess of 1000 solar
masses per year. We show that at long wavelengths (lambda_rest > 50mu) the
contribution of the AGN-powered torus emission is negligible. This explains how
previous FIR studies of high-redshift quasars that relied on single component
fits to (ground-based) observations at lambda_obs > 350mu reached T_FIR and
L_FIR values similar to our complete SED fits. Stacking the Herschel data of
four individually undetected sources reveals a significant average signal in
the PACS bands but not in SPIRE. The average SED of sources with individual
Herschel detections shows a striking surplus in near- and mid-infrared emission

bulk speed is zero while the electrons drift relative to ions, and where
electrons are much hotter. We examine in detail four runs where drift velocity
is systematically varied from lower than to larger than the electron thermal

dominate early on when streaming instabilities are too weak to discern. And
then intense ion-acoustic waves or Buneman instabilities appear, which tend to
be accompanied by localized electron and ion beams. Ion-acoustic modes and
Buneman modes co-exist in the system when the initial drift velocity is just
over the electron thermal speed. Beam modes are excited when the localized
beams with large enough velocities appear. In the developed stage of
instabilities, the direction in which density depressions propagate is always
opposite to that of the localized ion beams. When the initial drift velocity is

consider both, the classical blockmodel and its degree-corrected counterpart,
and study many of their properties analytically. We show that in the
degree-corrected blockmodel, node degrees display an interesting scaling
property, which is reminiscent of what is observed in real-world fractal

  Networks",,,,,"cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many online video websites provide the shortcut links to facilitate the video
sharing to other websites especially to the online social networks (OSNs). Such
video sharing behavior greatly changes the interplays between the two types of
websites. For example, users in OSNs may watch and re-share videos shared by
their friends from online video websites, and this can also boost the
popularity of videos in online video websites and attract more people to watch
and share them. Characterizing these interplays can provide great insights for
understanding the relationships among online video websites, OSNs, ISPs and so
on. In this paper we conduct empirical experiments to study the interplays
between video sharing websites and OSNs using three totally different data
sources: online video websites, OSNs, and campus network traffic. We find that,
a) there are many factors that can affect the external sharing probability of
videos in online video websites. b) The popularity of a video itself in online
video websites can greatly impact on its popularity in OSNs. Videos in Renren,
Qzone (the top two most popular Chinese OSNs) usually attract more viewers than
in Sina and Tencent Weibo (the top two most popular Chinese microblogs), which
indicates the different natures of the two kinds of OSNs. c) The analysis based
on real traffic data illustrates that 10\% of video flows are related to OSNs,
and they account for 25\% of traffic generated by all videos.

understanding the molecular basis of these associations. The integration of

contribute to this goal. We have developed a novel statistical methodology to
assess whether two association signals are consistent with a shared causal
variant. An application is the integration of disease scans with expression
quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies, but any pair of GWAS datasets can be
integrated in this framework. We demonstrate the value of the approach by
reanalysing a gene expression dataset in 966 liver samples with a published
meta-analysis of lipid traits including >100, 000 individuals of European
ancestry. Combining all lipid biomarkers, our reanalysis supported 29 out of 38
reported colocalisation results with eQTLs and identified 14 new colocalisation
results, highlighting the value of a formal statistical test. In two cases of
reported eQTL-lipid pairs (IFT172, TBKBP1) for which our analysis suggests that
the eQTL pattern is not consistent with the lipid association, we identify
alternative colocalisation results with GCKR and KPNB1, indicating that these
genes are more likely to be causal in these genomic intervals. A key feature of
the method is the ability to derive the output statistics from single SNP
summary statistics, hence making it possible to perform systematic
meta-analysis type comparisons across multiple GWAS datasets

for high speed compressible flows. The main point consists of two parts: an
appropriate discrete equilibrium distribution function (DEDF) $\mathbf{f}^{eq}$
and a discrete velocity model with flexible velocity size. The DEDF is obtained
by $\mathbf{f}^{eq}=\mathbf{C}^{-1}\mathbf{M}$, where $\mathbf{M}$ is a set of
moment of the Maxwellian distribution function, and $\mathbf{C}$ is the matrix
connecting the DEDF and the moments. The numerical components of $\mathbf{C}$
are determined by the discrete velocity model. The calculation of
$\mathbf{C}^{-1}$ is based on the analytic solution which is a function of the
parameter controlling the sizes of discrete velocity. The choosing of discrete
velocity model has a high flexibility. The specific heat ratio of the system
can be flexible. The approach works for the one-, two- and three-dimensional
model constructions. As an example, we compose a new lattice BGK kinetic model
which works not only for recovering the Navier-Stokes equations in the
continuum limit but also for measuring the departure of system from its
thermodynamic equilibrium. Via adjusting the sizes of the discrete velocities
the stably simulated Mach number can be significantly increased up to 30 or
even higher. The model is verified and validated by well-known benchmark tests.
Some macroscopic behaviors of the system due to deviating from thermodynamic
equilibrium around the shock wave interfaces are shown.

  Interference","16 pages, 13 figures",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Securing wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is a hard problem. In particular,
network access control is notoriously difficult to achieve due to the inherent
broadcast characteristics of wireless communications: an attacker can easily
target any node in its transmission range and affect large parts of a sensor
network simultaneously. In this paper, we therefore propose a distributed
guardian system to protect a WSN based on physically regulating channel access
by means of selective interference. The guardians are deployed alongside a
sensor network, inspecting all local traffic, classifying packets based on
their content, and destroying any malicious packet while still on the air. In
that sense, the system tries to gain ""air dominance"" over attackers. A key
challenge in implementing the guardian system is the resulting real-time
requirement in order to classify and destroy packets during transmission. We
present a USRP2 software radio based guardian implementation for IEEE 802.15.4
that meets this challenge; using an FPGA-based design we can even check for the
content of the very last payload byte of a packet and still prevent its
reception by a potential victim mote. Our evaluation shows that the guardians
effectively block 99.9% of unauthorized traffic in 802.15.4 networks in our
experiments, without disturbing the legitimate operations of the WSN.

direct estimation on the global flux rope properties. The main aim of this
study is to constrain the global shape of the flux rope axis from local
measurements, and to compare the results from in-situ data with imager
observations. We perform a statistical analysis of the set of MCs observed by
WIND spacecraft over 15 years in the vicinity of Earth. With the hypothesis of
having a sample of MCs with a uniform distribution of spacecraft crossing along
their axis, we show that a mean axis shape can be derived from the distribution
of the axis orientation. In complement, while heliospheric imagers do not
typically observe MCs but only their sheath region, we analyze one event where
the flux-rope axis can be estimated from the STEREO imagers. From the analysis
of a set of theoretical models, we show that the distribution of the local axis
orientation is strongly affected by the global axis shape. Next, we derive the
mean axis shape from the integration of the observed orientation distribution.
This shape is robust as it is mostly determined from the global shape of the
distribution. Moreover, we find no dependence on the flux-rope inclination on
the ecliptic. Finally, the derived shape is fully consistent with the one
derived from heliospheric imager observations of the June 2008 event. We have
derived a mean shape of MC axis which only depends on one free parameter, the
angular separation of the legs (as viewed from the Sun). This mean shape can be
used in various contexts such as the study of high energy particles or space
weather forecast.

transmit it across the network. Users accept this business model, but in most
cases the applications do not require the user's acknowledgment in order to

an invasion of privacy. In our analysis of 1,188 Android applications' network

low-lying Dirac-modes from the confined vacuum generated by lattice QCD. In
this system without low-lying Dirac modes, while the chiral condensate $\langle

0.1-1.0 arcsec or better, the extragalactic point-sources will appear isolated.
The same holds also for the compact structures due to the Sunyaev-Zeldovich
(SZ) effect (both thermal and kinetic). This situation is different from the
maps obtainable with instruments as WMAP or PLANCK where, because of the
smaller spatial resolution (approximately 5-30 arcmin), the point-sources and
the compact structures due to the SZ effect form a uniform noisy background
(the ""confusion noise""). Hence, the point-source detection techniques developed
in the past are based on the assumption that all the emissions that contribute
to the microwave background can be modeled with homogeneous and isotropic
(often Gaussian) random fields and make use of the corresponding spatial
power-spectra. In the case of very high resolution observations such an
assumption cannot be adopted since it still holds only for the CMB. Here, we
propose an approach based on the assumption that the diffuse emissions that
contribute to the microwave background can be locally approximated by
two-dimensional low order polynomials. In particular, two sets of numerical
techniques are presented containing two different algorithms each. The
performance of the algorithms is tested with numerical experiments that mimic

reconnection without null point and separatrices still need to be analyzed. We
focus on magnetic reconnection associated with the growth and evolution of a
flux rope and associated flare loops during an eruptive flare. We aim at
understanding the intrinsic characteristics of 3D reconnection in the presence
of quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs), how QSL properties are related to the
slip-running reconnection mode in general, and how this applies to eruptive
flares in particular. We studied the slip-running reconnection of field lines
in a magnetohydrodynamic simulation of an eruptive flare associated with a
torus-unstable flux rope. Field lines associated with the flux rope and the
flare loops undergo a continuous series of magnetic reconnection, which results
in their super-Alfvenic slipping motion. The time profile of their slippage
speed and the space distribution of the mapping norm are shown to be strongly
correlated. We find that the motion speed is proportional to the mapping norm.
Moreover, this slip-running motion becomes faster as the flux rope expands,
since the 3D current layer evolves toward a current sheet, and QSLs to
separatrices. The present analysis extends our understanding of the 3D
slip-running reconnection regime. We identified a controlling parameter of the
apparent velocity of field lines while they slip-reconnect, enabling the
interpretation of the evolution of post flare loops. This work completes the
standard model for flares and eruptions by giving its 3D properties.

targets with a 4 MW proton beam from the CERN High Power Superconducting Proton
Linac. The far detector for this facility is the 500 kt MEMPHYS water
Cherenkov, located in the Fr\'ejus tunnel. The second facility is the Neutrino
Factory, in which the neutrinos come from the decay of {\mu}+ and {\mu}- beams
in a storage ring. The far detector in this case is a 100 kt Magnetised Iron
Neutrino Detector at a baseline of 2000 km. The third option is a Beta Beam, in
which the neutrinos come from the decay of beta emitting isotopes, in
particular 6He and 18Ne, also stored in a ring. The far detector is also the
MEMPHYS detector in the Fr\'ejus tunnel. EUROnu has undertaken conceptual
designs of these facilities and studied the performance of the detectors. Based
on this, it has determined the physics reach of each facility, in particular
for the measurement of CP violation in the lepton sector, and estimated the
cost of construction. These have demonstrated that the best facility to build
is the Neutrino Factory. However, if a powerful proton driver is constructed
for another purpose or if the MEMPHYS detector is built for astroparticle
physics, the Super Beam also becomes very attractive.

eccentricity parameter space in high resolution. Massless test particle

show that HIP 14180 and HD 37124 do not provide stable orbits in the habitable

of information-based complexity (IBC for short) is that the computational
hardness of a problem can not be described properly only by the rate of
convergence. There exist problems for which an exponential number of
information operations is needed in order to reduce the initial error, although
there are algorithms which provide an arbitrary large rate of convergence.
Problems that yield this exponential dependence are said to suffer from the
curse of dimensionality. While analyzing numerical problems it turns out that
we can often vanquish this curse by exploiting additional structural
properties. The aim of this thesis is to present several approaches of this
type. Moreover, a detailed introduction to the field of IBC is given.

electrodiffusion theory along with various extensions has been invoked for
systems and phenomena as diverse as solar cells, surfactant solutions, water
splitting reactions, dielectric liquids, electrohydrodynamic flow, water and
ice physics, electrical double layers, non-Ohmic conduction in semiconductors
and oxide glasses, biochemical nerve response and magnetic monopoles in spin
ice. In view of this technological importance and the experimental ubiquity of
such phenomena, it is surprising that Onsager's Wien effect has never been
studied by numerical simulation. Here we present simulations of a lattice
Coulomb gas, treating the widely applicable case of a double equilibrium for
free charge generation. We obtain detailed characterisation of the Wien effect
and confirm the accuracy of the analytical theories as regards the field
evolution of the free charge density and correlations. We also demonstrate that
simulations can uncover further corrections, such as how the field-dependent
conductivity may be influenced by details of microscopic dynamics. We conclude
that lattice simulation offers a powerful means by which to investigate
system-specific corrections to the Onsager theory, and thus constitutes a
valuable tool for detailed theoretical studies of the numerous practical

detection of Class I to III young stellar objects (YSOs). We aim at
characterizing the circumstellar material around these YSOs and understanding
which disk parameters are most likely constrained by the new HGBS data. We
recovered 29 out of the 63 known YSOs in ChaII with a detection in at least one
of the PACS/SPIRE pass-bands: 3 Class I YSOs (i.e.,100%), 1 Flat source (i.e.,
50%), 21 Class II objects (i.e., 55%), 3 Class III objects (i.e, 16%) and the
unclassified source IRAS 12522-7640. We explore PACS/SPIRE colors of this
sample and present modeling of their SEDs using the RADMC-2D radiative transfer
code. We find that YSO colors are confined in specific regions of PACS/SPIRE
color-color diagrams. These color ranges are expected to be only marginally
contaminated by extragalactic sources and field stars and, hence, provide a
useful YSO selection tool when applied altogether. We were able to model the
SED of 26 out of the 29 detected YSOs. We discuss the degeneracy/limitations of
our SED fitting results and adopt the Bayesian method to estimate the
probability of different values for the derived disk parameters. The Cha II
YSOs present typical disk inner radii around 0.1 AU. The lower limit to Rc is
typically around 50 AU. The lower limits to Mdisk are proportional to the
stellar masses with a typical 0.3% ratio, i.e., in the range estimated in the
literature for young Class II stars and brown dwarfs across a broad range of
stellar masses. The estimated flaring angles, although very uncertain, point
towards rather flat disks (1+phi less than 1.2), as found for low-mass M-type
YSO samples in other star forming regions. Thus, our results support the idea
that disk properties show a dependence on stellar properties.

innovations, many societies today are struggling with a financial, economic and
public spending crisis, over-regulation, and mass unemployment, as well as lack
of sustainability and innovation. Can we still rely on conventional economic
thinking or do we need a new approach?
  I argue that, as the complexity of socio-economic systems increases,
networked decision-making and bottom-up self-regulation will be more and more
important features. It will be explained why, besides the ""homo economicus""
with strictly self-regarding preferences, natural selection has also created a
""homo socialis"" with other-regarding preferences. While the ""homo economicus""
optimizes the own prospects in separation, the decisions of the ""homo socialis""
are self-determined, but interconnected, a fact that may be characterized by
the term ""networked minds"". Notably, the ""homo socialis"" manages to earn higher
payoffs than the ""homo economicus"".
  I show that the ""homo economicus"" and the ""homo socialis"" imply a different
kind of dynamics and distinct aggregate outcomes. Therefore, next to the
traditional economics for the ""homo economicus"" (""economics 1.0""), a
complementary theory must be developed for the ""homo socialis"". This economic
theory might be called ""economics 2.0"" or ""socionomics"". The names are
justified, because the Web 2.0 is currently promoting a transition to a new
market organization, which benefits from social media platforms and could be
characterized as ""participatory market society"". To thrive, the ""homo socialis""
requires suitable institutional settings such a particular kinds of reputation
systems, which will be sketched in this paper. I also propose a new kind of
money, so-called ""qualified money"", which may overcome some of the problems of
our current financial system.

  Impulsive Noise within Power Substation",,,,,"cs.NI cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The installation of wireless technologies in power substations requires
characterizing the impulsive noise produced by the high-voltage equipment.
Substation impulsive noise might interfere with classic wireless communications
and none of the existing models can reliably represent this noise in wide band.
Previous studies have shown that impulsive noise is characterized by series of
damped oscillations with the amplitude, the duration and the occurrence times
of the impulses that are random. All these characteristics make this noise
time-correlated and the partitioned Markov chain remains an efficient model
that can ensure the correlation between the samples. In this study, we propose
to design a partitioned Markov chain to generate an impulsive noise that is
similar to the noise measured in existing substations, in time and frequency
domains. We configure our Markov chain to produce the impulses with the damped
oscillation effect, then, we determine the probability transition matrix and
the distribution of each state of the Markov chain. Finally, we generate noise
samples and we study the distribution of the impulsive noise characteristics.
Our Markov chain model can replicate the correlation between the measured noise
samples; also the distributions of the noise characteristics are similar in the
simulations and the measurements.

the way our society produces and distributes energy. This broad objective
embodies in the smart grid's futuristic vision of a completely decentralized
system powered by renewable plants. Imagine indeed such a real time power
network in which everyone could be a consumer or a producer. Based on a coupled
information system, each user would be able to buy or sell energy at a time
depending price that would allow a homogenization of the consumption,
eradicating the well known morning or evening peak. This attractive idea is
currently booming in the scientific community as it generates intellectual
challenges in various domains.
  Nevertheless, lots of unanswered questions remain. The first steps are
currently accomplished with the appearance of smart meters or the development
of more efficient energy storage devices. However, the design of the
decentralized information system of the smart grid, which will have to deal
with huge amounts of sensor's data in order to control the system within its
stability region, seems to be still in search.
  In the following survey, we concentrate on the telecommunication part of the
smart grid system. We begin by identifying different control level in the
system, and we focus on high control levels, which are commonly attributed to
the information system. We then define a few concepts of the smart grid and
present some interesting approaches using models from the complex system
theory. In the last part, we review ongoing works aiming at establishing
telecommunication requirements for smart grid applications, and underline the
necessity of building accountable models for testing these values.

fluctuations of an arbitrarily chosen subsystem must be buffered by the

of these fluctuations depends on the size of the reservoir. This leads to
various interesting consequences for the physical behavior of the subsystem. As
an example, we treat a lipid membrane with a phase transition that is embedded
in an aqueous reservoir. We find that large fluctuations are attenuated when
the reservoir has finite size. This has consequences for the compressibility of
the membrane since volume and area fluctuations are also attenuated. We compare
the equilibrium fluctuations of subsystems in finite reservoirs with those in
periodically driven systems. In such systems, the subsystem has only finite
time available to exchange heat with the surrounding medium. A larger frequency
therefore reduces the volume of the accessible heat reservoir. Consequently,
the fluctuations of the subsystem display a frequency dependence. While this
work is of particular interest for a subsystem displaying a transition such as
a lipid membrane, some of the results are of a generic nature and may
contribute to a better understanding of relaxation processes in general.

decay gamma-ray diffuse emission observed by the Fermi/LAT telescope in the
energy band above 100 GeV. We compare the neutrino flux calculated in this way
with the sensitivity of IceCube for the detection of extended sources. Assuming
a binned extended source analysis method, we find that the only possible
evidence for neutrino emission for sources located in the Northern hemisphere
is from the Cygnus region after 20 years of exposure. For other parts of the
Galactic Plane even a 20 years exposure with IceCube is not sufficient for the
detection. Taking into account marginal significance of the detectable source
in the Cygnus region, we find a precise position and size of the source region
which optimizes the signal-to-noise ratio for neutrinos. We also calculate the
low-energy threshold above which the neutrino signal could be detected with the
highest signal-to-noise ratio. This calculation of precise source position,
size and energy range, based on the gamma-ray data, could be used to remove the
'trial factor' in the analysis of the real neutrino data of IceCube. We notice
that the diffuse neutrino emission from the inner Galactic Plane in the
Southern Hemisphere is much brighter. A neutrino detector with characteristics
equivalent to IceCube, but placed at the Northern Hemisphere (such as KM3NeT),
would detect several isolated neutrino sources in the Galactic Plane within
just 5 years exposure at 5{\sigma} level. These isolated sources of ~TeV
neutrinos would unambiguously localize sources of cosmic rays which operated

century has been the problem of high-temperature superconductivity in
hole-doped copper-oxide compounds. Fundamental to this problem is the
competition between antiferromagnetic spin correlations, a symptom of strong
Coulomb interactions, and the kinetic energy of the doped carriers, which
favors delocalization. After discussing some of the early challenges in the
field, I describe the experimental picture provided by a variety of
spectroscopic and transport techniques. Then I turn to the technique of neutron
scattering, and discuss how it is used to determine spin correlations,
especially in model systems of quantum magnetism. Neutron scattering and
complementary techniques have determined the extent to which antiferromagnetic
spin correlations survive in the cuprate superconductors. One experimental case
involves the ordering of spin and charge stripes. I first consider related
measurements on model compounds, such as La(2-x)Sr(x)NiO(4+d), and then discuss
the case of La(2-x)Ba(x)CuO(4). In the latter system, recent transport studies
have demonstrated that quasi-two-dimensional superconductivity coexists with
the stripe order, but with frustrated phase order between the layers. This has
led to new concepts for the coexistence of spin order and superconductivity.
While the relevance of stripe correlations to high-temperature
superconductivity remains a subject of controversy, there is no question that
stripes are an intriguing example of electron matter that results from strong
correlations.

of the developer has long been recognized as fundamental. We propose a method
and a supporting tool to write and check a specification and an implementation
using a set of use cases, \ie input-output pairs that the developer supplies.
These are instances of both good (correct) and bad (incorrect) behavior. We
assume that the use cases are accurate, as it is easier to generate use cases
than to write an accurate specification. We incrementally construct a
specification (precondition and postcondition) based on semantic feedback
generated from these use cases. We check the accuracy of the constructed
specification using two proposed algorithms. The first algorithm checks the
accuracy of the specification against an automatically generated specification
from a supplied finite domain of use cases. The second checks the accuracy of
the specification via reducing its domain to a finite yet equally satisfiable
domain if possible. When the specification is mature, we start to also

provision for the continued modification of the specification, if needed. We
illustrate our method with two examples; linear search and text justify.

through analyzing the rotation rates of magnetic fields, distributed along
latitudes and varying with time at the time interval of August 1976 to April
2008. More pronounced differentiation of rotation rates is found to appear at
the ascending part of a Schwabe cycle than at the descending part on an
average. The coefficient $B$ in the standard form of differential rotation,
which represents the latitudinal gradient of rotation, may be divided into
three parts within a Schwabe cycle. Part one spans from the start to the
$4^{th}$ year of a Schwabe cycle, within which the absolute $B$ is
approximately a constant or slightly fluctuates. Part two spans from the
$4^{th}$ to the $7^{th}$ year, within which the absolute $B$ decreases. Part
three spans from the $7^{th}$ year to the end, within which the absolute $B$
increases. Strong magnetic fields repress differentiation of rotation rates, so
that rotation rates show less pronounced differentiation, but weak magnetic
fields seem to just reflect differentiation of rotation rates. The solar-cycle
related variation of solar differential rotation is inferred to the result of
both the latitudinal migration of the surface torsional pattern and the
repression of strong magnetic activity to differentiation of rotation rates.

layers, caused by post-growth low-temperature annealing, on their electronic-
and band-structure properties has been investigated by modulation
photoreflectance (PR) spectroscopy. The annealing-induced changes in structural
and magnetic properties of the layers were examined with high-resolution X-ray
diffractometry and SQUID magnetometery, respectively. They confirmed an
outdiffusion of Mn interstitials from the layers and an enhancement in their
hole concentration, which were more efficient for the layer covered with a Sb
cap acting as a sink for diffusing Mn interstitials. The PR results revealing a
decrease in the band-gap-transition energy in the as-grown (Ga,Mn)As layers,
with respect to that in the reference GaAs one, are interpreted by assuming a
merging of the Mn-related impurity band with the host GaAs valence band. On the
other hand, an increase in the band-gap-transition energy in the annealed
(Ga,Mn)As layers is interpreted as a result of the Moss-Burstein shift of the
absorption edge due to the Fermi level location within the valence band,
determined by the enhanced free-hole concentration. The experimental results
are consistent with the valence-band origin of mobile holes mediating
ferromagnetic ordering in (Ga,Mn)As, in agreement with the Zener model for
ferromagnetic semiconductors.

tunnelling mechanism. However, in various papers in the literature, the
analysis concerned almost only to obtain the Hawking temperature through a
comparison of the probability of emission of an outgoing particle with the
Boltzmann factor. In a interesting and well written paper, Banerjee and Majhi
improved the approach, by explicitly finding a black body spectrum associated
with black holes. On the other hand, this result, which has been obtained by
using a reformulation of the tunnelling mechanism, is in contrast which the
remarkable result by Parikh and Wilczek, that, indeed, found a probability of
emission which is compatible with a non-strictly thermal spectrum. By using our
recent introduction of an effective state for a black hole, here we solve such
a contradiction, through a slight modification of the analysis by Banerjee and
Majhi. The final result will be a non-strictly black body spectrum from the
tunnelling mechanism. We also show that, for an effective temperature, we can
write the corresponding effective metric by Hawking's periodicity arguments.
Potential important implications for the black hole information puzzle are also
discussed

available from the ubiquitous mobile devices to detect the presence of TVs and
track the media being viewed. Our approach leverages the array of sensors

location of TV sets, their state (ON or OFF), and the channels they are
currently tuned to. We present the feasibility of the proposed sensing

accuracy of 0.978 F-measure could be achieved.

quantum computing using a four-photon `star' cluster state generated by fusing

fidelity for the cluster state of 0.66 +/- 0.01 with respect to the ideal case.
We perform quantum process tomography to completely characterize a
controlled-NOT, Hadamard and T gate all on the same compact entangled resource.
Together, these operations make up a universal set of gates such that arbitrary
quantum logic can be efficiently constructed from combinations of them. We find
process fidelities with respect to the ideal cases of 0.64 +/- 0.01 for the
CNOT, 0.67 +/- 0.03 for the Hadamard and 0.76 +/- 0.04 for the T gate. The
characterisation of these gates enables the simulation of larger protocols and

concatenated CNOT gates. Our work provides some pragmatic insights into the
prospects for building up to a fully scalable and fault-tolerant one-way

dependence of ground state degeneracy (GSD) on the topology of the manifold
determined by the global shape of the system. Although the topology of a
physical system is practically hard to manipulate, recently it was shown that
in certain topologically ordered phases, topological defects can introduce
extra topological GSD. Here the topological defects can be viewed as
effectively changing the topology of the physical system. Previous studies have
been focusing on two spatial dimensions with point-like topological defects. In
three dimensions, line-like topological defects can appear. They are closed
loops in the bulk that can be linked and knotted, effectively leading to
complex three dimensional manifolds in certain topologically ordered states.
This paper studies the properties of such line-defects in a particular context:
the lattice dislocations. We give an analytical construction, together with
support from exact numerical calculations, for the dependence of the GSD on
dislocations of certain doubled versions of the exactly solvable Kitaev's toric
code models in both two and three dimensions. We find that the GSD of the 3d
model depends only on the total number of dislocation loops, no matter how they
are linked or knotted. The results are extended to Z_n generalizations of the
model. Additionally, we consider the phases in which the crystalline orders are
destroyed through proliferation of double dislocations. The resulting phases
are shown to host topological orders described by non-Abelian gauge theories.

identifies moving objects as the portion of a video frame that differs
significantly from a background model. A good background subtraction algorithm
has to be robust to changes in the illumination and it should avoid detecting
non-stationary background objects such as moving leaves, rain, snow, and
shadows. In addition, the internal background model should quickly respond to
changes in background such as objects that start to move or stop. We present a
new algorithm for video segmentation that processes the input video sequence as
a 3D matrix where the third axis is the time domain. Our approach identifies
the background by reducing the input dimension using the \emph{diffusion bases}

deleting the background. The algorithm has two versions and thus covers the
complete range of backgrounds: one for scenes with static backgrounds and the
other for scenes with dynamic (moving) backgrounds.

signals often stand out easily and weak ones may be indistinguishable from the
noise, we develop a statistical framework to provide a novel categorization of
the data into the signal, noise, and indistinguishable subsets. The
three-subset categorization is especially relevant under high-dimensionality as
a large proportion of signals can be obscured by the large amount of noise.
Understanding the three-subset phenomenon is important for the researchers in
real applications to design efficient follow-up studies. %For example,
candidates belonging to the signal subset may have priority for more focused
study, while those in the noise subset can be removed; and, for candidates in
the indistinguishable subset, additional data may be collected to further
separate weak signals from the noise. We develop an efficient data-driven
procedure to identify the three subsets. Theoretical study shows that, under
certain conditions, only signals are included in the identified signal subset
while the remaining signals are included in the identified indistinguishable
subsets with high probability. Moreover, the proposed procedure adapts to the
unknown signal intensity, so that the identified indistinguishable subset
shrinks with the true indistinguishable subset when signals become stronger.
The procedure is examined and compared with methods based on FDR control using
Monte Carlo simulation. Further, it is applied successfully in a real-data
application to identify genomic variants having different signal intensity.

the upper atmosphere and near-Earth space environment. Due to this heating and
expansion of the outer atmosphere by the energetic ultraviolet, X-ray and
particles expelled from the sun, the low Earth-Orbiting satellites (LEOS)
become vulnerable to an enhanced drag force by the ions and molecules of the
expanded atmosphere. Out of various types of perturbations, Earth directed CMEs
play the most significant role. They are more frequent and intense during the

are approaching another solar maximum later in 2013, it may be instructive to
analyse the effects of the past solar cycles on the orbiting satellites using
the archival data of space environment parameters as indicators. In this paper,
we compute the plasma drag on a model LEOS due to the atmospheric heating by

massive Galactic molecular clumps (part of the CHaMP sample) and their
associated young star clusters. The clumps show, for the first time in a ""dense
gas tracer"", a significant correlation between HCO+ line emission from cold
molecular gas and Br{\gamma} line emission of associated nebulae. This
correlation arises in the HCO+ line's brightness, not its linewidth. In
contrast, the correlation between the N2H+ line emission and Br{\gamma} is weak
or absent. The HCO+/N2H+ line ratio also varies widely from clump to clump:
bright HCO+ emission tends to be more closely associated with Br{\gamma}
nebulosity, while bright N2H+ emission tends to avoid areas that are bright in
Br{\gamma}. Both molecular species show correlations of weak significance with
infrared H2 v=1-0 and v=2-1 line emission, in or near the clumps. The H2
emission line ratio is consistent with fluorescent excitation in most of the
clumps, although thermal excitation is seen in a few clumps. We interpret these
trends as evidence for evolution in the gas conditions due to the effects of
ongoing star formation in the clumps, in particular, the importance of UV
radiation from massive YSOs as the driving agent that heats the molecular gas
and alters its chemistry. This suggests that some traditional dense gas tracers
of molecular clouds do not sample a homogeneous population of clumps, i.e.,
that the HCO+ brightness in particular is directly related to the heating and
disruption of cold gas by massive young stars, whereas the N2H+ better samples
gas not yet affected by this process. We therefore suggest that the
HCO+-N2H+-Br{\gamma} relationship is a useful diagnostic of a molecular clump's
progress in forming massive stars.

Resampling method usage algorithms and inferences for formulas of the

short-lived radioisotopes that existed at the time of the formation of the
earliest Solar System solids, including Type II supernovae, AGB and super-AGB
stars, and Wolf-Rayet star winds. Our previous adaptive mesh hydrodynamics
models with the FLASH2.5 code have shown which combinations of shock wave
parameters are able to simultaneously trigger the gravitational collapse of a
target dense cloud core and inject significant amounts of shock wave gas and
dust, showing that thin supernova shocks may be uniquely suited for the task.
However, recent meteoritical studies have weakened the case for a direct
supernova injection to the presolar cloud, motivating us to re-examine a wider
range of shock wave and cloud core parameters, including rotation, in order to
better estimate the injection efficiencies for a variety of stellar sources. We
find that supernova shocks remain as the most promising stellar source, though
planetary nebulae resulting from AGB star evolution cannot be conclusively
ruled out. Wolf-Rayet star winds, however, are likely to lead to cloud core
shredding, rather than to collapse. Injection efficiencies can be increased
when the cloud is rotating about an axis aligned with the direction of the
shock wave, by as much as a factor of $\sim 10$. The amount of gas and dust
accreted from the post-shock wind can exceed that injected from the shock wave,
with implications for the isotopic abundances expected for a supernova source.

the nature of ALPs, and represent an excellent complementary approach to
laboratory searches for ALPs. CTA's twenty times larger collection area and
improved sensitivity compared to current IACTs will make it an extraordinarily
powerful instrument to search for signatures of ALPs imprinted in the spectra

perform branching Brownian motion and the population size is kept constant
equal to $N > 1$, through the following selection mechanism: at all times only
the $N$ fittest particles survive, while all the other particles are removed.
Fitness is measured with respect to some given score function $s:\R^d \to \R$.
For some choices of the function $s$, it is proved that the cloud of particles
travels at positive speed in some possibly random direction. In the case where
$s$ is linear, we show under some assumptions on the initial configuration that
the shape of the cloud scales like $\log N$ in the direction parallel to motion
but at least $c(\log N)^{3/2}$ in the orthogonal direction for some $c > 0$. We
conjecture that the exponent 3/2 is sharp. This result is equivalent to the
following result of independent interest: in one-dimensional systems, the
genealogical time is greater than $c(\log N)^3$, thereby contributing a step
towards the original predictions of Brunet and Derrida. We discuss several open
problems and also explain how our results can be viewed as a rigorous
justification of Weismann's arguments for the role of recombination in
population genetics.

class of initial states of scalar field, for which the detector behaves as if
it is in a medium that is not in thermodynamic equilibrium and that undergoes a
relaxation to the equilibrium corresponding to the Bunch-Davies vacuum. We give
a prescription for calculating the relaxation times of the nonequilibrium

is always given by a universal value of half the curvature radius of de Sitter

proven very successful in the last decade. The 4-meter VISTA telescope,
equipped with the wide-field camera VIRCAM, offers a major step forward in
wide-field near-infrared imaging, and in order to utilise VISTA's large
field-of-view and sensitivity, the Dark Cosmology Centre provided a set of 16
narrow-band filters for VIRCAM. These NB118 filters are centered at a
wavelength near 1.19 micron in a region with few airglow emission lines. The
filters allow the detection of Halpha emitters at z = 0.8, Hbeta and [OIII]
emitters at z ~ 1.4, [OII] emitters at z = 2.2, and Ly-alpha emitters at z =
8.8. Based on guaranteed time observations of the COSMOS field we here present
a detailed description and characterization of the filters and their
performance. In particular we provide sky-brightness levels and depths for each
of the 16 detector/filter sets and find that some of the filters show signs of
some red-leak. We identify a sample of 2 x 10^3 candidate emission-line objects

known spectroscopic redshifts we determine the ""in situ"" passbands of the
filters and find that they are shifted by about 3.5-4 nm (corresponding to 30%
of the filter width) to the red compared to the expectation based on the
laboratory measurements. Finally, we present an algorithm to mask out
persistence in VIRCAM data. Scientific results extracted from the data will be

bolometric luminosity (L_Bol), Eddington ratio, radio loudness, radio
luminosity (L_Rad) and optical class (Sy 1/2) to determine what drives the
kinematics of this kpc-scale line emitting gas. Spectral stacking is used to
characterise how the average [OIII] profile changes as a function of these
variables. After accounting for the correlation between L_Bol and L_Rad, we
report that L_Rad has the strongest influence on the [OIII] profile, with
moderate radio luminosity AGNs (log(L_Rad)=23-25 W/Hz) having the broadest
[OIII] profiles. When binned according to Eddington ratio, only AGNs in our
highest bin (i.e., R_Edd>0.3) show any signs of having broadened [OIII]
profiles, although the small numbers of such extreme AGNs mean we cannot rule
out that other processes (e.g., radio jets) are responsible for this
broadening. We find no significant difference between the [OIII] profiles of
broad and narrow-line Seyfert 1s. The [OIII] profiles of Sy 1 and 2 AGNs show
the same trends in terms of line width, but Sy 1 AGNs display a much stronger
blue wing, which we interpret as evidence of outflowing ionised gas. Using
multi-component line fitting we calculate the proportions of AGNs with broad
[OIII] profiles, finding that moderate radio luminosity AGNs are roughly 5
times more likely to have extremely broad [OIII] lines (FWHM>1000km/s) compared
to lower L_Rad AGNs. Our results are consistent with the most disturbed gas
kinematics being induced by compact radio cores (rather than powerful radio
jets), although broadened [OIII] lines are also present, but much rarer, in low
L_Rad systems (<10^23 W/Hz). Our catalogue of multi-component fits is freely

as Landau damping by scatterings. It involves quantum statistical effects and
off-shell transport. Its temperature dependence can be highly nontrivial,
making it impossible to express the reheating temperature in terms of the model

dependence of the phase space due to the modified dispersion relations in the

perturbative reheating, which depends on the way particles in the primordial
plasma interact. For some interactions thermal masses can effectively close the
phase space for the dominant dissipative processes and thereby impose an upper
bound on the reheating temperature. In other cases they open up new channels of
dissipation, hence increase the reheating temperature. At high temperatures we
find that the universe can even be heated through couplings to fermions, which
are often assumed to be negligible due to Pauli-blocking. These effects may
also be relevant for baryogenesis, dark matter production, the fate of moduli

that formed with similar initial compositions. However, rather than being due
to differences in XUV irradiation between the planets, we find that this
contrast is due to the difference in the masses of the planets' rock/iron cores
and the impact that this has on mass loss evolution. We explore in detail how
our coupled models depend on irradiation, mass, age, composition, and the
efficiency of mass loss. Based on fits to large numbers of coupled evolution
and mass loss runs, we provide analytic fits to understand threshold XUV fluxes
for significant atmospheric loss, as a function of core mass and mass loss
efficiency. Finally we discuss these results in the context of recent studies
of the radius distribution of Kepler candidates. Using our parameter study, we
make testable predictions for the frequency of sub-Neptune sized planets. We
show that 1.8-4.0 R_earth planets should become significantly less common on
orbits within 10 days and discuss the possibility of a narrow ""occurrence

theories emerging from massive gravity, the only stable field configuration
created by static spherically symmetric sources was one with cosmological
asymptotics. Moreover, these backgrounds were shown to be sub-luminal
everywhere in the space; in contrast to the common believe that these theories
are necessarily superluminal in the vicinity of a static source. In this work
we complete that analysis by extending it to cover the whole parameter space of
these scalar-tensor theories. We find that the stability argument renders the
asymptotically flat backgrounds unrealizable, forcing once again for
cosmological asymptotics. In the case of pressureless sources these backgrounds
are stable. However, they get destabilized in the presence of positive
pressure, larger than a critical density. Even on the self-accelerated
background, on which the scalar mode decouples from sources, in the region
occupied by the source it acquires an elliptic equation of motion. Therefore,
we conclude that the only parameter space which is not ruled out, by solar
system measurements, is the one considered in Berezhiani {\it et al.}
(arXiv:1302.0549), namely the one for which the scalar and tensor modes can be
diagonalized via local transformations. We also reinvestigate the scale at
which perturbation theory breaks down in a general Galileon theory. We show
that the Vainshtein mechanism successfully redresses the strong coupling scale
to a small one, just like in the cubic Galileon, despite the cancellations
occurring in the special spherically symmetric case. We emphasize that even if

ultra-compact high velocity cloud in the ALFALFA survey is reported. The HI
detection is barely resolved by the Arecibo 305m telescope ~4' beam and has a
narrow HI linewidth (HPFW of 24 km/s). Further HI observations at Arecibo and
with the VLA corroborate the ALFALFA HI detection, provide an estimate of the
HI radius, ~1' at the 5 x 10^19 cm^-2 isophote, and show the cloud to exhibit
rotation with an amplitude of ~9.0 +/- 1.5 km/s. In other papers, Rhode et al.
(2013) show the HI source to have a resolved stellar counterpart and ongoing
star forming activity, while Skillman et al. (2013) reveal it as having
extremely low metallicity: 12 + log(O/H) = 7.16 +/- 0.04. The HI mass to
stellar mass ratio of the object is found to be 2.6. We use the Tully-Fisher
template relation in its baryonic form (McGaugh 2012) to obtain a distance
estimate D = 1.3 (+0.9,-0.5) Mpc. Additional constraints on the distance are
also provided by the optical data of Rhode et al. (2013) and McQuinn et al.
(private communication), both indicating a distance in the range of 1.5 to 2.0
Mpc. The three estimates are compatible within their errors. The object appears
to be located beyond the dynamical boundaries of, but still in close proximity
to the Local Group. Its pristine properties are consistent with the sedate
environment of its location. At a nominal distance of 1.75 Mpc, it would have
an HI mass of ~1.0 x 10^6 Msun, a stellar mass of ~3.6 x 10^5 Msun, and a
dynamical mass within the HI radius of ~1.5 x 10^7 Msun. This discovery
supports the idea that optically faint - or altogether dark - low mass halos
may be detectable through their non-stellar baryons.

large-N QCD with massless quarks, or in any large-N confining
asymptotically-free gauge theory massless in perturbation theory, that arise by
perturbation theory in conjunction with the renormalization group and by the

proposed Topological Field Theory (TFT) underlying large-N pure YM, that
computes sums of the scalar and of the pseudoscalar correlators satisfying the
asymptotic theorem and that implies for the large-N joint scalar and
pseudoscalar glueball spectrum exact linearity in the masses squared. On the
infrared side we test the prediction of the exact linearity in the TFT by
Meyer-Teper lattice numerical computation of the masses of the low-lying
glueballs in SU(8) YM, finding accurate agreement. Besides, we employ the
aforementioned ultraviolet and infrared constraints in order to compare
critically the scalar or pseudoscalar glueball propagators computed in the

minimax lower bounds for the quadratic risk in the proposed multichannel
deconvolution model when the response function is assumed to belong to a Besov
ball and the blurring function is assumed to possess some smoothness
properties, including both regular-smooth and super-smooth convolutions.
Furthermore, we propose an adaptive wavelet estimator of the response function
that is asymptotically optimal (in the minimax sense), or near-optimal within a
logarithmic factor, in a wide range of Besov balls. It is shown that the
optimal convergence rates depend on the balance between the smoothness
parameter of the response function, the kernel parameters of the blurring
function, the long memory parameters of the errors, and how the total number of
observations is distributed among the total number of channels. Some examples
of inverse problems in mathematical physics where one needs to recover initial

partial differential equation are used to illustrate the application of the
theory we developed. The optimal convergence rates and the adaptive estimators

star-forming galaxies ever observed. For its estimated luminosity, Leo P is
consistent with the relationship between luminosity and oxygen abundance seen
in nearby dwarf galaxies. Leo P shows normal alpha element abundance ratios
(Ne/O, S/O, and Ar/O) when compared to other XMD galaxies, but elevated N/O,
consistent with the ""delayed release"" hypothesis for N/O abundances. We derive
a helium mass fraction of 0.2509 +0.0184 -0.0123 which compares well with the

We suggest that surveys of very low mass galaxies compete well with emission

may be divided into two classes: the relatively rare XMD emission line galaxies
which are associated with starbursts triggered by infall of low-metallicity gas
and the more common, relatively quiescent XMD galaxies like Leo P, with very
low chemical abundances due to their intrinsically small masses.

evidence has argued for the existence of a spin liquid ground state in the

this claim involves the presence of a gapped state that lacks any identifiable
order. This argument relies on being able to distinguish small order from no

which uses quantum Monte Carlo to search for one of the key features that
positively identify the topological spin liquid: the topological degeneracy.
For any finite system, this topological degeneracy is split where the splitting
decays exponentially with system size. We search for low lying states in the
energy spectrum that could be identified as these topologically degenerate
states. We show that, for system sizes up to N=162 sites, there is no evidence

clusters is complex. The weakly collisional nature of the ICM leads to thermal
conduction that is channelled along field lines. This anisotropic heat
conduction profoundly changes the stability of the ICM atmosphere, with
convective stabilities being driven by temperature gradients of either sign.
Here, we employ the Athena magnetohydrodynamic code to investigate the local
non-linear behavior of the heat-flux driven buoyancy instability (HBI),
relevant in the cores of cooling-core clusters where the temperature increases
with radius. We study a grid of 2-d simulations that span a large range of
initial magnetic field strengths and numerical resolutions. For very weak
initial fields, we recover the previously known result that the HBI wraps the
field in the horizontal direction thereby shutting off the heat flux. However,
we find that simulations which begin with intermediate initial field strengths
have a qualitatively different behavior, forming HBI-stable filaments that
resist field-line wrapping and enable sustained vertical conductive heat flux
at a level of 10--25% of the Spitzer value. While astrophysical conclusions
regarding the role of conduction in cooling cores require detailed global
models, our local study proves that systems dominated by HBI do not necessarily
quench the conductive heat flux.

  community states and are robust to sampling depth","Submitted to PeerJ",,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In microbial ecology studies, the most commonly used ways of investigating
alpha (within-sample) diversity are either to apply count-only measures such as
Simpson's index to Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) groupings, or to use
classical phylogenetic diversity (PD), which is not abundance-weighted.
Although alpha diversity measures that use abundance information in a
phylogenetic framework do exist, but are not widely used within the microbial
ecology community. The performance of abundance-weighted phylogenetic diversity
measures compared to classical discrete measures has not been explored, and the
behavior of these measures under rarefaction (sub-sampling) is not yet clear.
In this paper we compare the ability of various alpha diversity measures to
distinguish between different community states in the human microbiome for
three different data sets. We also present and compare a novel one-parameter
family of alpha diversity measures, BWPD_\theta, that interpolates between
classical phylogenetic diversity (PD) and an abundance-weighted extension of
PD. Additionally, we examine the sensitivity of these phylogenetic diversity
measures to sampling, via computational experiments and by deriving a closed
form solution for the expectation of phylogenetic quadratic entropy under
re-sampling. In all three of the datasets considered, an abundance-weighted
measure is the best differentiator between community states. OTU-based
measures, on the other hand, are less effective in distinguishing community
types. In addition, abundance-weighted phylogenetic diversity measures are less
sensitive to differing sampling intensity than their unweighted counterparts.
Based on these results we encourage the use of abundance-weighted phylogenetic
diversity measures, especially for cases such as microbial ecology where
species delimitation is difficult.

Kolmogorov timescale, are in the range from ~0.1 to ~800. Using simulation
results, we show that the model by Pan & Padoan (PP10) gives satisfactory
predictions for the rms relative velocity between identical particles. The
probability distribution function (PDF) of the relative velocity is found to be
highly non-Gaussian. The PDF tails are well described by a 4/3 stretched
exponential function for particles with tau_p ~ 1-2 T_L, where T_L is the
Lagrangian correlation timescale, consistent with a prediction based on PP10.
The PDF approaches Gaussian only for very large particles with tau_p >~ 54 T_L.
We split particle pairs at given distances into two types with low and high
relative speeds, referred to as continuous and caustic types, respectively, and
compute their contributions to the collision kernel. Although amplified by the
effect of clustering, the continuous contribution vanishes in the limit of
infinitesimal particle distance, where the caustic contribution dominates. The
caustic kernel per unit cross section rises rapidly as St increases toward ~1,
reaches a maximum at tau_p ~ 2 T_L, and decreases as tau_p^{-1/2} for tau_p >>

VIRUS instrument. The primary result of this work explores how 10+ years of
simulated wear on a VIRUS fiber bundle affects both transmission and focal
ratio degradation (FRD) of the optical fibers. During the accelerated lifetime
tests we continuously monitored the fibers for signs of FRD. We find that
transient FRD events were common during the portions of the tests when motion
was at telescope slew rates, but dropped to negligible levels during rates of
motion typical for science observation. Tests of fiber transmission and FRD
conducted both before and after the lifetime tests reveal that while
transmission values do not change over the 10+ years of simulated wear, a clear
increase in FRD is seen in all 18 fibers tested. This increase in FRD is likely
due to microfractures that develop over time from repeated flexure of the fiber
bundle, and stands in contrast to the transient FRD events that stem from
localized stress and subsequent modal diffusion of light within the fibers.
There was no measurable wavelength dependence on the increase in FRD over 350
nm to 600 nm. We also report on bend radius tests conducted on individual
fibers and find the 266 microns VIRUS fibers to be immune to bending-induced
FRD at bend radii of R > 10cm. Below this bend radius FRD increases slightly
with decreasing radius. Lastly, we give details of a degradation seen in the
fiber bundle currently deployed on the Mitchell Spectrograph (formally VIRUS-P)
at McDonald Observatory. The degradation is shown to be caused by a localized
shear in a select number of optical fibers that leads to an explosive form of
FRD. In a few fibers, the overall transmission loss through the instrument can
exceed 80%.

for spatial Weyl invariance. Those solutions of the Einstein equations that
have global, constant mean curvature slicings, are mirrored by solutions in
Shape Dynamics. However, there are solutions of Shape Dynamics that have no
counterpart in General relativity, just as there are solutions of GR that are
not completely foliable by global constant mean curvature slicings (such as the
Schwarzschild spacetime). It is therefore interesting to analyze directly the
equations of motion of Shape Dynamics in order to find its own solutions,
irrespective of properties of known solutions of GR. Here I perform a first
study in this direction by utilizing the equations of motion of Shape Dynamics
in a spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat ansatz to derive an analogue of
the Birkhoff theorem. There are two significant differences with respect to the
usual Birkhoff theorem in GR. The first regards the construction of the
solution: the spatial Weyl gauge freedom of shape dynamics is used to simplify
the problem, and boundary conditions are required. In fact the derivation is
simpler than the usual Birkhof theorem as no Christoffel symbols are needed.
The second, and most important difference is that the solution obtained is
uniquely the isotropic wormhole solution, in which no singularity is present,
as opposed to maximally extended Schwarzschild. This provides an explicit
example of the breaking of the duality between General relativity and Shape
Dynamics, and exhibits some of its consequences.

color tones, contrast, vignetting, and etc. These 'picture styles' are directly
related to the scene radiance, image pipeline of the camera, and post
processing functions. Due to the complexity and nonlinearity of these causes,
popular gradient-based image descriptors won't be invariant to different
picture styles, which will decline the performance of object recognition. Given
that images shared online or created by individual users are taken with a wide
range of devices and may be processed by various post processing functions, to
find a robust object recognition system is useful and challenging. In this
paper, we present the first study on the influence of picture styles for object
recognition, and propose an adaptive approach based on the kernel view of
gradient descriptors and multiple kernel learning, without estimating or
specifying the styles of images used in training and testing. We conduct
experiments on Domain Adaptation data set and Oxford Flower data set. The
experiments also include several variants of the flower data set by processing
the images with popular photo effects. The results demonstrate that our
proposed method improve from standard descriptors in all cases.

well known that light has a constant speed irrespective of the relative motion.
Does a rotating body immersed in a stream of photons experience a

experiences such a lateral force from an electromagnetic wave. In fact, the
sign of the lateral force is the same as that of the fluid-mechanical analogue
as long as the electric susceptibility is positive (\epsilon>\epsilon_{0}), but
for negative-susceptibility materials (e.g. metals) we show that the lateral

classical electromagnetic scattering problem, Mie-resonance enhancements that
occur in other scattering phenomena also enhance the lateral force.

applications, a binary vector is a feature map of an image, where each binary

take a Bayesian approach to the inference of unknown parameters of a non-linear
state model; this, in turn, requires the availability of efficient Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods for the latent (hidden) variables and model
parameters. Using the ensemble technique of Neal (2010) and the embedded HMM

for non-linear state space models. The key idea is to perform parameter updates
conditional on an enormously large ensemble of latent sequences, as opposed to
a single sequence, as with existing methods. We look at the performance of this
ensemble method when doing Bayesian inference in the Ricker model of population
dynamics. We show that for this problem, the ensemble method is vastly more
efficient than a simple Metropolis method, as well as 1.9 to 12.0 times more
efficient than a single-sequence embedded HMM method, when all methods are

single-particle approximation such a system has one electron band and one hole
band crossing the Fermi level. If the bilayer is undoped, the Fermi surfaces of
these bands coincide. Such a band structure is unstable with respect to a set
of spontaneous symmetry violations. Specifically, strong on-site Coulomb
repulsion stabilizes antiferromagnetic order. At small doping and low
temperatures, the homogeneous phase is unstable, and experiences phase
separation into an undoped antiferromagnetic insulator and a metal. The
metallic phase can be either antiferromagnetic (commensurate or incommensurate)
or paramagnetic depending on the system parameters. We derive the phase diagram
of the system on the doping-temperature plane and find that, under certain
conditions, the transition from paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic phase may
demonstrate re-entrance. When disorder is present, phase separation could
manifest itself as a percolative insulator-metal transition driven by doping.

diffuse interstellar plasma, not a collection of unresolved point sources, such
plasma cannot be gravitationally bound, and its regeneration would require a
huge amount of energy. Here we show that the spatial distribution of the GCDX
does NOT correlate with the number density distribution of an old stellar

rate (sSFR), with more passive galaxies having a higher clustering amplitude.
We find similar trends using SDSS group catalogues, and verify that these are
not affected by possible biases due to the group finding algorithm. Low mass
central galaxies reside in narrow bins of halo mass, so the observed trends of
higher clustering amplitude for galaxies with lower sSFR is not driven by
variations of the parent halo mass. We argue that the clustering dependence on
sSFR represent a direct detection of assembly bias. In addition, contrary to
what expected based on clustering of dark matter haloes, we find that low-mass
central galaxies in SAMs with larger host halo mass have a {\it lower}
clustering amplitude than their counter-parts residing in lower mass haloes.
This results from the fact that, at fixed stellar mass, assembly bias has a
stronger influence on clustering than the dependence on the parent halo mass.

field is applied, adequate charge carriers are tunneled into the ZnS:Cu system

important issue in biology, is studied in terms of phenotypic fluctuations. By
numerically evolving gene regulatory networks, the proportionality between the
phenotypic variances of epigenetic and genetic origins is confirmed. The former
is given by the variance of the phenotypic fluctuation due to noise in the
developmental process; and the latter, by the variance of the phenotypic
fluctuation due to genetic mutation. The relationship suggests a link between
robustness to noise and to mutation, since robustness can be defined by the
sharpness of the distribution of the phenotype. Next, the proportionality
between the variances is demonstrated to also hold over expressions of
different genes (phenotypic traits) when the system acquires robustness through
the evolution. Then, evolution under environmental variation is numerically
investigated and it is found that both the adaptability to a novel environment
and the robustness are made compatible when a certain degree of phenotypic
fluctuations exists due to noise. The highest adaptability is achieved at a
certain noise level at which the gene expression dynamics are near the critical
state to lose the robustness. Based on our results, we revisit Waddington's
canalization and genetic assimilation with regard to the two types of
phenotypic fluctuations.

studied in which all new particles that have wrong lepton-numbers are odd under
W-parity, while the standard model particles are even. Therefore, the lightest

non-Markovian effect is observed in the time correlation function of the random
force. It is further shown that an emergent dynamics of the fusion process can
be described by the generalized Langevin equation with memory effects by
appropriately incorporating the microscopic information of individual nucleons
through the random force and its time correlation function.

of core-collapse supernovae in light of the recent findings of massive neutron
stars in binaries as well as of an indication of neutron-richness in the PNS
ejecta because of the nucleon potential corrections on neutrino opacities. To
this end, a spherically symmetric, general relativistic, steady-state wind
model is applied for a wide range of PNS masses between 1.2 M_sun and 2.4 M_sun
with the latter reaching the causality limit. Nucleosynthesis calculations with
these PNS models are performed by assuming a time evolution of electron
fraction with its minimal value of Y_e = 0.4, which mimics recent
hydrodynamical results. The fundamental nucleosynthetic aspect of the PNS wind
is found to be the production of Sr, Y and Zr in quasi-equilibrium and of the
elements with A = 90-110 by a weak r-process, which can be an explanation for
the abundance signatures in r-process-poor Galactic halo stars. PNSs more
massive than 2.0 M_sun can eject heavy r-process elements, however, with
substantially smaller amount than what is needed to account for the solar
content. PNS winds can be thus the major origin of light trans-iron elements
but no more than 10% of those heavier than A ~ 110, although they may be the
sources of the low-level abundances of Sr and Ba found in numerous metal-poor
stars if the maximum mass of PNS exceeds 2.0 M_sun.

elements consist of pairs of cobordant loops. A Chas-Sullivan product is
described on the cobordism, and three other products, namely the 'vertical',
'horizontal' and 'total' products are re-introduced. (They have already been
defined in an earlier paper by the author). A loop calculus is introduced on
the space of loops, consisting of the loop variation functional,the loop
derivative, Mandelstam derivative, and what the author wishes to call, the
Gambini-Pullin contact functional. The loop derivative happens to be a
generator of the group of loops, and the Gambini-Pullin functional is an
infinitesimal generator of diffeomorphisms. A toy model of gravity is
formulated in terms of the above, and it is proven that the total product
provides for the Maurer-Cartan structure of the space. Further, new quantities
labeled as 'momenta', 'velocity' and 'energy' are introduced in terms of the
loop products and loop derivatives. The prospect of re-constructing general
relativity in higher dimensions is explored, with the 'momenta' and 'velocity'
being the basic loop variables. In the process, it is proven that the 'momenta'

devise algorithms that are rate-optimal in the sense that they perform as well

cluster (droplet) growth over a free energy barrier $\Delta F^*$, constructed
in terms of a balance of surface and bulk term of a ""critical droplet"" of
radius $R^*$, implying that the rates of droplet growth and shrinking
essentially balance each other for droplet radius $R=R^*$. For heterogeneous
nucleation at surfaces, the barrier is reduced by a factor depending on the
contact angle. Using the definition of ""physical"" clusters based on the
Fortuin-Kasteleyn mapping, the time-dependence of the cluster size distribution
is studied for ""quenching experiments"" in the kinetic Ising model, and the
cluster size $\ell ^*$ where the cluster growth rate changes sign is estimated.
These studies of nucleation kinetics are compared to studies where the relation
between cluster size and supersaturation is estimated from equilibrium
simulations of phase coexistence between droplet and vapor in the canonical
ensemble. The chemical potential is estimated from a lattice version of the
Widom particle insertion method. For large droplets it is shown that the

rule. ""Geometrical clusters"" (defined such that each site belonging to the

results only for temperatures less than 60% of the critical temperature, where

as in the case of the pure Coulomb potential. The case of a short-range
potential of an arbitrary form with inverse power singularity is treated on the
basis of the integral Lippmann-Schwinger equation. It is shown that, if the

standard singularity. For the case of $r^{-\rho}$ singularity of the potential
with $1\le\rho<2$ the additional singularity in the asymptotic behavior of the

ordered phase and typically involves four-spin interactions on a

entanglement entropy (TEE), but due to low signal to noise, it is extremely
difficult to observe in these systems, and one usually resorts to measuring
anyonic statistics of excitations or non-local string operators to reveal the
order. We describe a continuous-variable analog to the surface code using
quantum harmonic oscillators on a two-dimensional lattice, which has the
distinctive property of needing only two-body nearest-neighbor interactions for
its creation. Though such a model is gapless, satisfies an area law, and the
ground state can be simply prepared by measurements on a finitely squeezed and
gapped two-dimensional cluster state, which does not have topological order.
Asymptotically, the TEE grows linearly with the squeezing parameter, and we
show that its mixed-state generalization, the topological mutual information,
is robust to some forms of state preparation error and can be detected simply
using single-mode quadrature measurements. Finally, we discuss scalable
implementation of these methods using optical and circuit-QED technology.

where two legitimate parties (Alice and Bob) communicate in the presence of an
eavesdropper (Eve), over a Gaussian multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)
wiretap channel. This problem involves designing, subject to a power
constraint, the transmit and the receive filters which minimize the
mean-squared error (MSE) between the legitimate parties whilst assuring that
the eavesdropper MSE remains above a certain threshold. We consider a general
MIMO Gaussian wiretap scenario, where the legitimate receiver uses a linear
Zero-Forcing (ZF) filter and the eavesdropper receiver uses either a ZF or an
optimal linear Wiener filter. We provide a characterization of the optimal
filter designs by demonstrating the convexity of the optimization problems. We
also provide generalizations of the filter designs from the scenario where the
channel state is known to all the parties to the scenario where there is
uncertainty in the channel state. A set of numerical results illustrates the
performance of the novel filter designs, including the robustness to channel
modeling errors. In particular, we assess the efficacy of the designs in
guaranteeing not only a certain MSE level at the eavesdropper, but also in
limiting the error probability at the eavesdropper. We also assess the impact
of the filter designs on the achievable secrecy rates. The penalty induced by
the fact that the eavesdropper may use the optimal non-linear receive filter
rather than the optimal linear one is also explored in the paper.

hand, seminal papers by Almgren and Chriss introduced a decomposition between a
permanent market impact and a temporary (or instantaneous) market impact. This
decomposition is used by most practitioners in execution models. On the other
hand, recent research advocates for the use of a new modeling framework that
goes down to the resilient dynamics of order books: transient market impact.
One of the main criticisms against permanent market impact is that it has to be
linear to avoid dynamic arbitrage. This important discovery made by Huberman
and Stanzl and Gatheral favors the transient market impact framework, as linear
permanent market impact is at odds with reality. In this paper, we reconsider
the point made by Gatheral using a simple model for market impact and show that
permanent market impact can be nonlinear. Also, and this is the most important
part from a practical point of view, we propose different statistics to
estimate permanent market impact and execution costs that generalize the ones
proposed in Almgren at al. (2005).

the motion of the ion and strongly suppresses the emission perpendicular to

perturbed by Poisson noise. The objective function is a generalized
Kullback-Leibler divergence, depending on both the unknown object and unknown
point spread function (PSF), without the addition of regularization terms;
constrained minimization, with suitable convex constraints on both unknowns, is
considered. The problem is nonconvex and we propose to solve it by means of an
inexact alternating minimization method, whose global convergence to stationary
points of the objective function has been recently proved in a general setting.
The method is iterative and each iteration, also called outer iteration,
consists of alternating an update of the object and the PSF by means of fixed
numbers of iterations, also called inner iterations, of the scaled gradient
projection (SGP) method. The use of SGP has two advantages: first, it allows to
prove global convergence of the blind method; secondly, it allows the
introduction of different constraints on the object and the PSF. The specific
constraint on the PSF, besides non-negativity and normalization, is an upper
bound derived from the so-called Strehl ratio, which is the ratio between the
peak value of an aberrated versus a perfect wavefront. Therefore a typical
application is the imaging of modern telescopes equipped with adaptive optics
systems for partial correction of the aberrations due to atmospheric
turbulence. In the paper we describe the algorithm and we recall the results
leading to its convergence. Moreover we illustrate its effectiveness by means
of numerical experiments whose results indicate that the method, pushed to
convergence, is very promising in the reconstruction of non-dense stellar
clusters. The case of more complex astronomical targets is also considered, but
in this case regularization by early stopping of the outer iterations is
required.

of Voronoi Tessellations to analyse the environmental densities of individual
galaxies. Applying statistical analyses to colour, $r-$band magnitude and
redshift-matched samples, we show there to be a significant difference at the
3.5$\sigma$ level between the normalized environmental densities of these two
populations. This is such that infrared emission (a tracer of star formation
activity) favours underdense regions compared to those inhabited by exclusively
optically observed galaxies selected to be of the same $r-$band magnitude,
colour and redshift. Thus more highly star-forming galaxies are found to reside
in the most underdense environments, confirming previous studies that have
proposed such a correlation. However, the degeneracy between redshift and
far-infrared luminosity in our flux-density limited sample means that we are
unable to make a stronger statement in this respect. We then apply our method
to synthetic light cones generated from semi-analytic models, finding that over
the whole redshift distribution the same correlations between star-formation
rate and environmental density are found.

of the nonlocality. The competition is explicitly exhibited by analytically
obtained asymptotic form of generic solutions. Particular exact solutions are
found analytically, and full soliton families are constructed in a numerical
form. The multi-channel settings, with two or three local minima of the
nonlinearity coefficient, are considered here for the first time, for both
local and nonlocal models of the present type. States with multiple solitons

across ~25% of orbital phase and two quasi-simultaneous XMM-Newton observations
of length 20ks and 14ks, occurring during and just after the eclipse
respectively. An enhanced INTEGRAL emission history is provided with 19
previously unreported outbursts identified in the archival 18-60 keV data set.
The XMM-Newton eclipse observation showed prominent Fe-emission and a flux of
2.8*10^-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.5 - 10 keV). Through the comparison of the
detected eclipse and post eclipse flux, the supergiant mass loss rate through
the stellar wind was determined as \dot{M}_{w} = 2.3-3.8*10^-7 M_{\odot} yr^-1.
The post eclipse XMM-Newton observation showed a dynamic flux evolution with
signatures of the X-ray pulsation, a period of flaring activity, structured nH
variations and the first ever detection of an X-ray intensity dip, or
'off-state', in a pulsating supergiant fast X-ray transient. Consideration is

of the current theories of X-ray dip generation is that of a transition between
Compton cooling dominated and radiative cooling dominated subsonic accretion
regimes within the 'quasi-spherical' model of wind accretion. Under this

observational evidence of a highly magnetised neutron star in a supergiant fast

and cavities, in which are released the acidic protons to form a solution of
hydronium ions in water embedded in the polymer matrix. Below 273 K, a
phenomenon of water sorption/desorption occurs, whose origin is still an open
question. Performing neutron diffraction, we monitored the quantity of ice
formed during the sorption/desorption as a function of temperature down to 180
K. Upon cooling, we observe that ice forms outside of the membrane and
crystallises in the hexagonal Ih form. Simultaneously, the membrane shrinks and
dehydrate, leading to an increase of the hydronium ions concentration inside
the matrix. Reversibly, the ice melts and the membrane re-hydrate upon heating.
A model of solution, whose freezing point varies with the hydronium
concentration, is proposed to calculate the quantity of ice formed as a
function of temperature. The quantitative agreement between the model and
experimental data explains the smooth and reversible behavior observed during
the sorption or desorption of water, pointing out the origin of the phenomena.
The proposed picture reconciles both confinement and entropic effects. Other
examples of water filled electrolyte nano-structures are eventually discussed,
in the context of clarifying the conditions for water transport at low
temperature.

discrete character of the nonlinear interactions between couples and their
pathogens/parasites. Mapped into a field theory, the stochastic processes
performed by the species are described by continuous fields in space and time.
The way that the model's parameters scale with subsequent iterations of the

the majority of which are polluted by human-created radio frequency

need to be visually inspected in order to determine if they are real pulsars.
This process can be labor intensive. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm
called PEACE (Pulsar Evaluation Algorithm for Candidate Extraction) which
improves the efficiency of identifying pulsar signals. The algorithm ranks the
candidates based on a score function. Unlike popular machine-learning based
algorithms, no prior training data sets are required. This algorithm has been
applied to data from several large-scale radio pulsar surveys. Using the
human-based ranking results generated by students in the Arecibo Remote Command
enter programme, the statistical performance of PEACE was evaluated. It was
found that PEACE ranked 68% of the student-identified pulsars within the top
0.17% of sorted candidates, 95% within the top 0.34%, and 100% within the top
3.7%. This clearly demonstrates that PEACE significantly increases the pulsar
identification rate by a factor of about 50 to 1000. To date, PEACE has been
directly responsible for the discovery of 47 new pulsars, 5 of which are
millisecond pulsars that may be useful for pulsar timing based
gravitational-wave detection projects.

Orcus and Quaoar, a thermophysical model was also run to better constrain their
thermal properties. We derive the size, albedo, and thermal properties,

Several targets show a significant decrease in their spectral emissivity

other dwarf planets Pluto and Haumea, and its value implies high contents of
refractory materials mixed with ices.

complexity of problems involving uncountably many objects, such as real
numbers, sets and functions, that can be represented only through
approximation. The key idea is to use (a certain class of) string functions as
names representing these objects. These are more expressive than infinite
sequences, which served as names in prior work that formulated complexity in
more restricted settings. An advantage of using string functions is that we can
define their ""size"" in the way inspired by higher-type complexity theory. This
enables us to talk about computation on string functions whose time or space is
bounded polynomially in the input size, giving rise to more general analogues
of the classes P, NP, and PSPACE. We also define NP- and PSPACE-completeness
under suitable many-one reductions.
  Because our framework separates machine computation and semantics, it can be
applied to problems on sets of interest in analysis once we specify a suitable
representation (encoding). As prototype applications, we consider the
complexity of functions (operators) on real numbers, real sets, and real
functions. For example, the task of numerical algorithms for solving a certain
class of differential equations is naturally viewed as an operator taking real
functions to real functions. As there was no complexity theory for operators,
previous results only stated how complex the solution can be. We now
reformulate them and show that the operator itself is polynomial-space
complete.

group, free abelian group, or the fundamental group of an orientable surface.
It is also known to be false for a large class of infinite groups. However,
there are no known counterexamples for finite groups. In this dissertation we
will give a general outline of the positive scalar curvature problem, and
sketch proofs of some of the known positive and negative results. We will then

group of order 16 (joint with Kijti Rodtes), and the rank three group (Z/2)^3.
The topological obstruction in question lies in the connective real homology
ko_*(BG) of the classifying space of BG. Our method of proof is to first sketch
calculations of ko_*(BG), using the techniques and calculations of Bruner and
Greenlees. We then give explicit geometric constructions to produce
sufficiently many manifolds of positive scalar curvature.

more visionary acceptation, it is a model of energy management in which the
users are engaged in producing energy as well as consuming it, while having
information systems fully aware of the energy demand-response of the network
and of dynamically varying prices. A natural question is then: to make the
Smart Grid a reality will the Distribution Grid have to be updated? We assume a
positive answer to the question and we consider the lower layers of Medium and
Low Voltage to be the most affected by the change. In our previous work, we
have analyzed samples of the Dutch Distribution Grid in our previous work and
we have considered possible evolutions of these using synthetic topologies
modeled after studies of complex systems in other technological domains in
another previous work. In this paper, we take an extra important further step
by defining a methodology for evolving any existing physical Power Grid to a
good Smart Grid model thus laying the foundations for a decision support system
for utilities and governmental organizations. In doing so, we consider several
possible evolution strategies and apply then to the Dutch Distribution Grid. We
show how more connectivity is beneficial in realizing more efficient and
reliable networks. Our proposal is topological in nature, and enhanced with
economic considerations of the costs of such evolutions in terms of cabling
expenses and economic benefits of evolving the Grid.

discs/tori and their physical relationship with other evolved, massive stars
such as luminous blue variables is uncertain. In order to investigate both
issues we have analysed the long term behaviour of the canonical sgB[e] star
LHA 115-S 18. We employed the OGLE II-IV lightcurve to search for (a-)periodic
variability and supplemented these data with new and historic spectroscopy. In
contrast to historical expectations for sgB[e] stars, S18 is both
photometrically and spectroscopically highly variable. The lightcurve is
characterised by rapid aperiodic `flaring' throughout the 16 years of
observations. Changes in the high excitation emission line component of the
spectrum imply evolution in the stellar temperature - as expected for luminous
blue variables - although somewhat surprisingly, spectroscopic and photometric
variability appears not to be correlated. Characterised by emission in low
excitation metallic species, the cool circumstellar torus appears largely
unaffected by this behaviour. Finally, in conjunction with intense, highly
variable HeII emission, X-ray emission implies the presence of an unseen binary
companion. S18 provides observational support for the putative physical
association of (a subset of) sgB[e] stars and luminous blue variables. Given
the nature of the circumstellar environment of S18 and that luminous blue
variables have been suggested as SN progenitors, it is tempting to draw a
parallel to the progenitors of SN1987A and the unusual transient SN2009ip.
Moreover the likely binary nature of S18 strengthens the possibility that the
dusty discs/tori that characterise sgB[e] stars are the result of binary-driven
mass-loss; consequently such stars may provide a window on the short lived
phase of mass-transfer in massive compact binaries.

densities, when averaged over sufficiently large volumes of space, are expected

of testing for homogeneity that is almost free of selection biases. Using ~10^6
galaxies from the SDSS DR7 survey, I show that regions of space separated by ~2
Gpc/h have the same average cluster size and density to 5 - 10 percent. I show
that the average cluster size, averaged over many galaxies, remains constant to
less than 10 percent from small redshifts out to redshifts of 0.25. The
evolution of the cluster sizes with increasing redshift gives fair agreement
when the same analysis is applied to the Millennium Simulation. However, the MS
does not replicate the increase in cluster amplitudes with redshift seen in the

2 infinite families and, if n is odd, three exceptional groups. In the second

topology of the space of loops with a given symmetry, which we show is related
to certain cosets of the pure braid group in the full braid group, and to
centralizers of elements of the corresponding coset. In particular, we refine
the symmetry classification by classifying the connected components of the set

experimental study conducted on a benchmark of real Web services shows that
these networks possess the typical properties of complex networks (small-world,

  Communications, Special Issue on Adaptive Media Streaming",,"10.1109/JSAC.2014.140405",,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Today, the technology for video streaming over the Internet is converging
towards a paradigm named HTTP-based adaptive streaming (HAS). HAS comes with
two unique flavors. First, by riding on top of HTTP/TCP, it leverages the
network-friendly TCP to achieve firewall/NATS traversal and bandwidth sharing.
Second, by pre-encoding and storing the video in a number of discrete bitrate
levels, it introduces video bitrate adaptivity in a scalable way that the video
encoding is excluded from the closed-loop adaptation. A conventional wisdom is
that the TCP throughput observed by a HAS client indicates the available
network bandwidth, thus can be used as a reliable reference for the video
bitrate selection.
  We argue that this no longer holds true when HAS becomes a substantial
fraction of the Internet traffic. We show that when multiple HAS clients
compete at a network bottleneck, the presence of competing clients and the
discrete nature of the video bitrates would together create confusion for a
client to correctly perceive its fair-share bandwidth. Through analysis and
real experiments, we demonstrate that this fundamental limitation would lead
to, for example, video rate oscillation that negatively impacts the video
watching experiences. We therefore argue that it is necessary to implement at
the application layer a ""probe-and-adapt"" mechanism for HAS video rate
adaptation, which is akin but orthogonal to the transport-layer network rate
adaptation achieved by TCP. We present PANDA -- a client-side rate adaptation
algorithm for HAS -- as an embodiment of this idea. Our testbed results show
that compared to conventional algorithms, PANDA is able to reduce the
instability of video rate by 60%, at a given risk of buffer underrun.

a hint on the existence of approximate 44-year cycles in the variations of the
mean maximum sizes of the large and the big sunspot groups. During the decline
phase of cycle 23, there was a scarcity in the very small sunspot groups
(maximum area AM < or = 37 msh), which may be related to the slow growth of
sunspot groups during this period. During the minimum between cycles 23 and 24
may be due to the presence of a number of small sunspot groups whose AM > 37
msh was larger than that of whose AM < or = 37 msh, the relatively large size
coronal holes were present at low-latitudes and the total solar irradiance was

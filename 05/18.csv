dynamical behaviors and distinguishes qualitative properties in characteristic

linearization. For $C^{1,1}$ hyperbolic diffeomorphisms on Banach spaces $C^1$
linearization was proved under a gap condition together with a band condition
of the spectrum. In this paper, the result of $C^1$ linearization in Banach
spaces is strengthened to $C^{1,\beta}$ linearization with a constant $\beta>0$
under a weaker band condition by a decomposition with invariant foliations. The
weaker band condition allows the spectrum to be a union of more than two but
finitely many bands but restricts those bands to be bounded by a number
depending on the supremum of contractive spectrum and the infimum of expansive
spectrum. Furthermore, we give an estimate for the exponent $\beta$ and prove
that the estimate is sharp in the planar case.

indicate that the planet's atmosphere is vertically compact, perhaps due to a
water-rich composition that yields a large mean molecular weight. Another
suggestion is that the atmosphere is hydrogen/helium-rich with clouds that
obscure predicted absorption features. Previous models that incorporate clouds
have included their effect without a strong physical motivation for their
existence. Here, we present model atmospheres of GJ 1214b that include
physically-motivated clouds of two types. We model the clouds that form as a
result of condensation in chemical equilibrium, as they likely do on brown
dwarfs, which include KCl and ZnS for this planet. We also include clouds that
form as a result of photochemistry, forming a hydrocarbon haze layer. We use a
photochemical kinetics model to understand the vertical distribution and
available mass of haze-forming molecules. We model both solar and
enhanced-metallicity cloudy models and determine the cloud properties necessary
to match observations. In enhanced-metallicity atmospheres, we find that the
equilibrium clouds can match the observations of GJ 1214b if they are lofted
high into the atmosphere and have a low sedimentation efficiency (fsed=0.1). We
find that models with a variety of hydrocarbon haze properties can match the
observations. Particle sizes from 0.01 to 0.25 micron can match the
transmission spectrum with haze-forming efficiencies as low as 1-5%.

They found that if the moving directions of objects are too close, the firing
rate profile will be very similar to that with one direction. As the difference
in the moving directions of objects is large enough, the neuronal system would
respond in such a way that the network enhances the resolution in the moving
directions of the objects. In this paper, we propose that this behavior can be
reproduced by neural networks with dynamical synapses when there are multiple

plane passing through the equinoxes and the north celestial pole. Out of a

sky and the remaining 15 in the other half. The probability that in a random
distribution of 3CRR quasars in the sky, statistical fluctuations could give
rise to an asymmetry in observed numbers up to this level is only $\sim 1\%$.
Also only about 1/4th of Fanaroff-Riley 1 (FR1) type of radio galaxies lie in

why should such anisotropies lie about a great circle decided purely by the
orientation of earth's rotation axis and/or the axis of its revolution around

BaFe2As2 by the randomly introduced localized Mn moments acting as strong
magnetic impurities. While the SDW transition at x = 0, 2.5% and 5% remains
equally sharp, in the x = 12% sample we observe an abrupt smearing of the
antiferromagnetic transition in temperature and a considerable suppression of
the spin gap in the magnetic excitation spectrum. According to our
muon-spin-relaxation, nuclear magnetic resonance and neutron-scattering data,
antiferromagnetically ordered rare regions start forming in the x = 12% sample
significantly above the N\'eel temperature of the parent compound. Upon
cooling, their volume grows continuously, leading to an increase in the
magnetic Bragg intensity and to the gradual opening of a partial spin gap in
the magnetic excitation spectrum. Using neutron Larmor diffraction, we also
demonstrate that the magnetically ordered volume is characterized by a finite
orthorhombic distortion, which could not be resolved in previous diffraction
studies most probably due to its coexistence with the tetragonal phase and a
microstrain-induced broadening of the Bragg reflections. We argue that
Ba[Fe(1-x)Mn(x)](2)As(2) could represent an interesting model spin-glass

in space to characterise the atmospheres of transiting exoplanets. This
technique is challenging from the ground because ground-based spectrographs
tend not to be designed to be photometrically stable, and effects such as
variable slit losses cause significant systematic uncertainties. An alternative
approach is to use simultaneous photometric observations in multiple wavebands
to determine wavelength dependent transit depth differences. We report an
application of this technique to one of the hottest known exoplanets, WASP-12b,
using the triple-beam camera ULTRACAM. We obtained simultaneous light curves in
Sloan u', and two narrow band filters centered on 4169 and 6010 angstroms, with
FWHMs 52 and 118 angstroms respectively. We fit these light curves with a
photometric model and determine the planetary radius in the three different
bands. Our data show no evidence for a difference in planetary radius over the
wavelength range we study, and are consistent with an atmosphere that is
dominated by Rayleigh scattering from a high altitude haze, as well as more
complicated atmosphere models which include the effects of molecules such as
TiO. Our planetary radius measurements have an average precision of 2.6 per
cent, compared to the ~1.4 - 2.4 per cent radius differences predicted by the
models over this wavelength range. We also find a consistent time of ingress
and egress across our three wavebands, in contrast to the early ingress which
has been reported for this system at shorter wavelengths.

known Stefan model, and includes the classical porous medium equation. It may
be represented by the differential inclusion, for a real-valued function

  \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\partial_u \Psi(x/\ve,x,u)-\nabla_x\cdot

conditions, where $\Psi(z,x,\cdot)$ is strictly convex and
$\psi(z,x,t,u,\cdot)$ is a $C^1$ convex function, both with quadratic growth,
satisfying some additional technical hypotheses. As functions of the
oscillatory variable, $\Psi(\cdot,x,u),\psi(\cdot,x,t,u,\eta)$ and
$f(\cdot,x,t,u)$ belong to the generalized Besicovitch space $\BB^2$ associated
with an arbitrary ergodic algebra $\AA$. The periodic case was addressed by
Visintin (2007), based on the two-scale convergence technique. Visintin's
analysis for the periodic case relies heavily on the possibility of reducing
two-scale convergence to the usual $L^2$ convergence in the cartesian product
$\Pi\X\R^n$, where $\Pi$ is the periodic cell. This reduction is no longer
possible in the case of a general ergodic algebra. To overcome this difficulty,
we make essential use of the concept of two-scale Young measures for algebras
with mean value, associated with bounded sequences in $L^2$.

multi-line light-sectioning approach and uses sophisticated algorithms for
real-time registration (S. Ettl et al., Appl. Opt. 51 (2012) 281-289). As
""single-shot principle"", light sectioning enables the option to get surface
data from one single camera exposure. But there is a drawback: A pixel-dense
measurement is not possible because of fundamental information-theoretical
reasons. By ""pixel-dense"" we understand that each pixel displays individually
measured distance information, neither interpolated from its neighbour pixels
nor using lateral context information. Hence, for monomodal single-shot
principles, the 3D data generated from one 2D raw image display a significantly
lower space-bandwidth than the camera permits. This is the price one must pay
for motion robustness. Currently, our sensors project about 10 lines (each with
1000 pixels), reaching an considerable lower data efficiency than theoretically
possible for a single-shot sensor. Our aim is to push Flying Triangulation to
its information-theoretical limits. Therefore, the line density as well as the
measurement depth needs to be significantly increased. This causes serious
indexing ambiguities. On the road to a single-shot 3D movie camera, we are
working on solutions to overcome the problem of false line indexing by
utilizing yet unexploited information. We will present several approaches and
will discuss profound information-theoretical questions about the information
efficiency of 3D sensors.

been regarded as evidence of an interaction with their host galaxies. In this
paper, we assume that ram-pressure stripping is the dominant mechanism that
removed gas from the dSphs and we use this to derive a lower bound on the
density of the corona of the Milky Way at large distances (50-90 kpc) from the
Galactic centre. At the same time, we derive an upper bound by demanding that
the interstellar medium of the dSphs is in pressure equilibrium with the hot
corona. We consider two dwarfs (Sextans and Carina) with well-determined orbits
and star formation histories. Our approach introduces several novel features:
we use the measured star formation histories of the dwarfs to derive the time
at which they last lost their gas, and (via a modified version of the
Kennicutt-Schmidt relation) their internal gas density at that time; we use a
large suite of 2D hydrodynamical simulations to model the gas stripping; and we
include supernova feedback tied to the gas content. Despite having very
different orbits and star formation histories, we find results for the two
dSphs that are in excellent agreement with one another. We derive an average
particle density of the corona of the Milky Way at 50-90 kpc in the range
1.3-3.6 10^{-4} cm^{-3}. Including additional constraints from X-ray emission
limits and pulsar dispersion measurements, we extrapolate Galactic coronal
density profiles and we estimate the fraction of baryons that can exist within
the virial radius of the Milky Way. For an isothermal corona (T=1.8 10^6 K)
this is small, 10-20 % of the universal baryon fraction. Only a hot (T=3 10^6
K) and adiabatic corona can contain all of the Galaxy's missing baryons. Models
for the Milky Way must explain why its corona is in a hot adiabatic thermal
state or why a large fraction of its baryons lie beyond the virial radius.

association (Epsilon Cha), one of several young moving groups spread across the
southern sky. We re-assess the putative membership of Epsilon Cha using the
best-available proper motion and spectroscopic measurements, including new ANU
2.3-m/WiFeS observations. After applying a kinematic analysis our final
membership comprises 35-41 stars from B9 to mid-M spectral types, with a mean
distance of 110+/-7 pc and a mean space motion of
(U,V,W)=(-10.9+/-0.8,-20.4+/-1.3,-9.9+/-1.4) km/s. Theoretical evolutionary
models suggest Epsilon Cha is 3-5 Myr old, distinguishing it as the youngest
moving group in the solar neighbourhood. Fifteen members show 3-22 micron
spectral energy distributions attributable to circumstellar discs, including 11
stars which appear to be actively accreting. Epsilon Cha's disc and accretion
fractions (29+8-6 and 32+9-7 per cent, respectively) are both consistent with a
typical 3-5 Myr-old population. Multi-epoch spectroscopy reveals three M-type
members with broad and highly-variable H-alpha emission as well as several new
spectroscopic binaries. We reject 11 stars proposed as members in the
literature and suggest they may belong to the background Cha I and II clouds or
other nearby young groups. Our analysis underscores the importance of a
holistic and conservative approach to assigning young stars to kinematic
groups, many of which have only subtly different properties and ill-defined
memberships. We conclude with a brief discussion of Epsilon Cha's connection to
the young open cluster Eta Cha and the Sco-Cen OB association. Contrary to
earlier studies which assumed Eta and Epsilon Cha are coeval and were born in
the same location, we find the groups were separated by ~30 pc when Eta Cha
formed 4-8 Myr ago in the outskirts of Sco-Cen, 1-3 Myr before the majority of
Epsilon Cha members.

a period of 72.46 days. The significance of this modulation is about 7 standard
deviations in Gaussian statistics. We interpret it as the orbital period of the

of the period, superimposed to a flat level roughly consistent with zero. In
the soft X-rays the source is detected only in 5 out of 12 XRT observations,

becomes centrally concentrated enough to produce high strong lensing (SL)
cross-sections is not well understood. It has been suggested that the baryonic
condensation of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) due to cooling may drag dark
matter to the cores and thus steepen the profile. In this work, we search for
evidence of ongoing ICM cooling in the first large, well-defined sample of
strong lensing selected galaxy clusters in the range 0.1 < z < 0.6. Based on
known correlations between the ICM cooling rate and both optical emission line
luminosity and star formation, we measure, for a sample of 89 strong lensing
clusters, the fraction of clusters that have [OII]3727 emission in their
brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). We find that the fraction of line-emitting BCGs
is constant as a function of redshift for z > 0.2 and shows no statistically
significant deviation from the total cluster population. Specific star
formation rates, as traced by the strength of the 4000 angstrom break, D_4000,
are also consistent with the general cluster population. Finally, we use
optical imaging of the SL clusters to measure the angular separation, R_arc,
between the arc and the center of mass of each lensing cluster in our sample
and test for evidence of changing [OII] emission and D_4000 as a function of
R_arc, a proxy observable for SL cross-sections. D_4000 is constant with all
values of R_arc, and the [OII] emission fractions show no dependence on R_arc
for R_arc > 10"" and only very marginal evidence of increased weak [OII]
emission for systems with R_arc < 10"". These results argue against the ability
of baryonic cooling associated with cool core activity in the cores of galaxy
clusters to strongly modify the underlying dark matter potential, leading to an
increase in strong lensing cross-sections.

systems play an important and intriguing role in the transport processes of
nanoscale systems. Many previous minimalistic models used to describe the
quantum path interference driven by incoherent fields are based on the
approximations including the second order perturbation for the weak coupling
limit, the ad-hoc choices of two-time correlation functions and $\it{etc}$. On
the other hand, the similar model to study the non-adiabatic molecular
electronic excitation have been extensively developed and many efficient
quantum molecular dynamics simulation schemes, such as the Ehrenfest scheme,
have been proposed.
  In this paper, I aim to propose an unified model, extend the Ehrenfest scheme
to study the interactions of system-light and system-phonon simultaneously and
gain insight into and principles of the roles of quantum path interferences in
the realistic molecular systems. I discuss how to derive the time-dependent
stochastic Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger equation from the Ehrenfest scheme as a
foundation to discuss the detailed balance for the weak coupling limit and
therefore the quantum correction in the Ehrenfest scheme. Different from the
master equation technique, the Ehrenfest scheme doesn't need any specific
assumptions about spectral densities and two time correlation functions. With
simple open two-level and three-level quantum systems, I show the effect of the
quantum path interference on the steady state populations. Currently I only
focus on the role of the phonon thermal reservoir. The electromagnetic field
(solar light) will be modeled as a thermal reservoir and discussed in detail in
the future paper.

determination of the luminosity function of these stars, even if far from being
conclusive, is extremely important to test the reliability of theoretical
models. In particular, strong constraints on the mixing treatment and the
mass-loss rate can be derived.
  We present an updated Luminosity Function of Galactic Carbon Stars obtained
from a re-analysis of available data already published in previous papers.
Starting from available near- and mid-infrared photometric data, we
re-determine the selection criteria. Moreover, we take advantage from updated
distance estimates and Period-Luminosity relations and we adopt a new
formulation for the computation of Bolometric Corrections. This leads us to
collect an improved sample of carbon-rich sources from which we construct an
updated Luminosity Function.
  The Luminosity Function of Galactic Carbon Stars peaks at magnitudes around
-4.9, confirming the results obtained in a previous work. Nevertheless, the
Luminosity Function presents two symmetrical tails instead of the larger high
luminosity tail characterizing the former Luminosity Function. The derived
Luminosity Function of Galactic Carbon Stars matches the indications coming
from recent theoretical evolutionary Asymptotic Giant Branch models, thus
confirming the validity of the choices of mixing treatment and mass-loss
history. Moreover, we compare our new Luminosity Function with its counterpart
in the Large Magellanic Cloud finding that the two distributions are very
similar for dust-enshrouded sources, as expected from stellar evolutionary
models. Finally, we derive a new fitting formula aimed to better determine
Bolometric Corrections for C-stars.

to be done. Each image is represented by a finite dimensional feature vector
whose components are the UID values between the image and a finite set of image
prototypes from each of the feature categories. The method is automatic since
once the user selects the prototype images, the feature vectors are
automatically calculated without the need to do any image analysis. The
prototype images can be of different size, in particular, different than the
image size. Based on a collection of such cases any supervised or unsupervised
learning algorithm can be used to train and produce an image classifier or
image cluster analysis. In this paper we present the image feature-extraction
method and use it on several supervised and unsupervised learning experiments
for satellite image data.

adiabatic processes by adding control protocols. In classical systems, we work
out the control protocols by analyzing the classical adiabatic approximation.
In quantum systems, we follow the idea of transitionless driving by Berry [J.
Phys. A: Math. Theor. Vol.42 365303 (2009)]. Such fast-forward adiabatic
processes can be performed at arbitrary fast speed, and in the meanwhile reduce
the work fluctuation. In both systems, we use a time-dependent harmonic
oscillator model to work out explicitly the work function and the work
fluctuation in three types of processes: fast-forward adiabatic processes,
adiabatic processes, and non-adiabatic processes. We show the significant
reduction on work fluctuation in fast-forward adiabatic process. We further
illustrate how the fast-forward process improved the converging rate of the
Jarzynski equality between the work function and the free energy. As an
application, we show that the fast-forward process not only maximizes the
output power but also improve the efficiency of a quantum engine.

matter is composed of weakly interactive massive particles (WIMP), the
potential signals, e.g. neutrinos, from UCMHs due to the dark matter
annihilation would be detected by IceCube/DeepCore or other detectors and such
signals would have a very useful complementarity of gamma rays observations. On
the other hand, the formation of UCMHs is related to primordial curvature
perturbations on the smaller scales. So constraints on the abundance of UCMHs
can be used to give a limit on the perturbations on these scales. In previous
works in the literature, the authors focused on the {\gamma}-ray signals from
UCMHs due to dark matter annihilation. In this work, we investigate the
neutrino signals from nearby UCMHs. Although no excess of neutrino signals the
dark matter annihilation has been observed, the constraints on the abundance of
UCMHs can be obtained and these constraints can be translated into the limit on
the primordial curvature perturbations on small scales.

clades of species evolve in adaptive zones, defined as collections of niches
occupied by species with similar traits and patterns of habitat use. Simpson
hypothesized that species enter new adaptive zones in one of three ways:
extinction of competitor species, dispersal to a new geographic region, or the
evolution of a key trait that allows species to exploit resources in a new way.
However, direct tests of Simpson's hypotheses for the entry into new adaptive
zones remain elusive. Here we evaluate the fit of a Simpsonian model of jumps
between adaptive zones to phylogenetic comparative data. We use a novel
statistical approach to show that anoles, a well-studied adaptive radiation of
Caribbean lizards, have evolved by a series of evolutionary jumps in trait
evolution. Furthermore, as Simpson predicted, trait axes strongly tied to
habitat specialization show jumps that correspond with the evolution of key
traits and/or dispersal between islands in the Greater Antilles. We conclude
that jumps are commonly associated with major adaptive shifts in the
evolutionary radiation of anoles.

users should access spectrum, and we consider two choices: overlay (orthogonal
spectrum between D2D and cellular UEs) and underlay (non-orthogonal). The
second issue is how D2D users should choose between communicating directly or
via the base station, a choice that depends on distance between the potential
D2D transmitter and receiver. We propose a tractable hybrid network model where
the positions of mobiles are modeled by random spatial Poisson point process,
with which we present a general analytical approach that allows a unified
performance evaluation for these questions. Then, we derive analytical rate
expressions and apply them to optimize the two D2D spectrum sharing scenarios
under a weighted proportional fair utility function. We find that as the
proportion of potential D2D mobiles increases, the optimal spectrum partition
in the overlay is almost invariant (when D2D mode selection threshold is large)
while the optimal spectrum access factor in the underlay decreases. Further,
from a coverage perspective, we reveal a tradeoff between the spectrum access
factor and the D2D mode selection threshold in the underlay: as more D2D links
are allowed (due to a more relaxed mode selection threshold), the network
should actually make less spectrum available to them to limit their
interference.

Schr\""odinger cocyles, they may in turn be applied to give new and simple
proofs of theorems regarding their relation with the spectral analysis of
one-dimensional discrete Schr\""odinger operators. Concretely, this paper gives
four different descriptions of uniformly hyperbolic sequences together with the
detailed proofs of their equivalence. It provides concise and self-contained
proof of the Johnson's Theorem [Jo], both for sequence and dynamically defined
potentials. In particular, we give two different proofs of the direction
`uniform hyperbolicity away from the spectrum', of which one is the standard
argument in the spirit of Russell Johnson's original proof and the other
involves Combes-Thomas type of estimate [CT]. Finally, the relation between the
Avalanche Principle, discovered by Goldstein-Schlag [GS], and the uniformly
hyperbolic sequence is explored which yields a simple proof and a better
version of the Avalanche Principle. Many ingredients of the proofs in this
paper are new, in particular the use of asymptotic stable and unstable
directions, are of independent interest and have been applied to many other
related problems.

These
identical and independently distributed variables are drawn from the parent
distribution rho. The running record equals the maximum of all elements in the
sequence up to a given point. We define a superior sequence as one where all
running records are above the average record, expected for the parent
distribution rho. We find that the fraction of superior sequences S_N decays
algebraically with sequence length N, S_N ~ N^{-beta} in the limit N-->infty.
Interestingly, the decay exponent beta is nontrivial, being the root of an
integral equation. For example, when rho is a uniform distribution with compact
support, we find beta=0.450265. In general, the tail of the parent distribution
governs the exponent beta. We also consider the dual problem of inferior
sequences, where all records are below average, and find that the fraction of
inferior sequences I_N decays algebraically, albeit with a different decay
exponent, I_N ~ N^{-alpha}. We use the above statistical measures to analyze
earthquake data.

outdated CSI on the performance of bidirectional amplify-and-forward RS is
investigated. The optimal single RS scheme in minimizing the symbol error rate

a multiple RS scheme is proposed and verified that this scheme is a feasible
solution to compensate the diversity loss caused by outdated CSI.

required for cooperative effects and gives the interface between atoms and

is also of great importance in the study of fuzzy automata. However, most work
in the literature considered only state reduction of fuzzy automata, whereas
the state minimization problem is almost untouched for fuzzy automata. Thus in
this paper we focus on the latter problem. Formally, the decision version of
the minimization problem of fuzzy automata is as follows: \begin{itemize}
  \item Given a fuzzy automaton $\mathcal{A}$ and a natural number $k$, that
is, a pair $\langle \mathcal{A}, k\rangle$, is there a $k$-state fuzzy
automaton equivalent to $\mathcal{A}$? \end{itemize} We prove for the first

polynomial equations and then present a procedure to solve these systems.
Afterwards, we apply the solvability of a system of fuzzy polynomial equations
to the minimization problem mentioned above, obtaining the decidability.
Finally, we point out that the above problem is at least as hard as

the triple coincidence between the positron annihilation and the third photon,
it is possible to separate the reconstructed 'true' events from background. In
order to characterize this technique, Monte-Carlo simulations and image

the end of each chromosome are shortened at cell division and, when they reach
a critical length, the cell will enter permanent cell cycle arrest - a state
known as senescence. This mechanism is thought to be tumor suppressing, as it
helps prevent precancerous cells from dividing uncontrollably.
  Stem cells express the enzyme telomerase, which elongates the telomeres,
thereby postponing senescence. However, unlike germ cells and most types of
cancer cells, stem cells only express telomerase at levels insufficient to
fully maintain the length of their telomeres leading to a slow decline in
proliferation potential. It is not yet fully understood how this decline
influences the risk of cancer and the longevity of the organism. We here
develop a stochastic model to explore the role of telomere dynamics in relation
to both senescence and cancer. The model describes the accumulation of
cancerous mutations in a multicellular organism and creates a coherent
theoretical framework for interpreting the results of several recent
experiments on telomerase regulation. We demonstrate that the longest average
cancer free life span before cancer onset is obtained when stem cells start
with relatively long telomeres that are shortened at a steady rate at cell
division. Furthermore, the risk of cancer early in life can be reduced by
having a short initial telomere length. Finally, our model suggests that
evolution will favour a shorter than optimal average cancer free life span in
order to postpone cancer onset until late in life.

trilinear WWgamma coupling. The new physics effects on this vertex are
parametrized in a model-independent fashion through an effective electroweak
Yang-Mills sector, which is constructed by considering two essentially
different sources of new physics. In one scenario, Lorentz violation will be
considered exclusively as the source of new physics effects. This type of new
physics is considered in an extension of the Standard Model that is known as
the Standard Model Extension (SME), which is an effective field theory that
contemplates CPT and Lorentz violation in a model-independent fashion. Any
source of new physics that respects the Lorentz symmetry, will be considered
within the general context of the well known Conventional Effective Standard
Model (CESM) extension. Both the SME and the CESM descriptions include gauge
invariant operators of dimension higher than four, which, in general, transform
as Lorentz tensors of rank higher than zero. Whereas in the former theory
observer Lorentz invariants are constructed by contracting these operators with
constant Lorentz tensors, in the latter the corresponding Lorentz invariant
interactions are obtained contracting such operators with products of the
metric tensor. We focus our study on the possibility of experimentally
distinguish both types of new physics effects on the WWgamma vertex. It is

using, correspond to the field theoretical methods more commonly in use.

M\""uller, Helga Wagner","Likelihood-free Simulation-based Optimal Design",,,,"IFAS research report 2013-64","stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Simulation-based optimal design techniques are a convenient tool for solving
a particular class of optimal design problems. The goal is to find the optimal
configuration of factor settings with respect to an expected utility criterion.
This criterion depends on the specified probability model for the data and on
the assumed prior distribution for the model parameters. We develop new
simulation-based optimal design methods which incorporate likelihood-free
approaches and utilize them in novel applications.
  Most simulation-based design strategies solve the intractable expected
utility integral at a specific design point by using Monte Carlo simulations
from the probability model. Optimizing the criterion over the design points is
carried out in a separate step. M\""uller (1999) introduces an MCMC algorithm
which simultaneously addresses the simulation as well as the optimization
problem. In principle, the optimal design can be found by detecting the utility
mode of the sampled design points. Several improvements have been suggested to
facilitate this task for multidimensional design problems (see e.g. Amzal et
al. 2006).
  We aim to extend this simulation-based design methodology to design problems
where the likelihood of the probability model is of an unknown analytical form
but it is possible to simulate from the probability model. We further assume
that prior observations are available. In such a setting it is seems natural to
employ approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) techniques in order to be able to
simulate from the conditional probability model. We provide a thorough review
of adjacent literature and we investigate the benefits and the limitations of
our design methodology for a particular paradigmatic example.

variables depend on incident node variables through a fixed probability kernel.
The class includes planted con- straint satisfaction problems (CSPs), as well
as more general structures motivated by coding and community clustering
problems. It is shown that under mild assumptions on the kernel and for sparse
random graphs, the conditional entropy of the node variables given the edge
variables concentrates around a deterministic threshold. This implies in
particular the concentration of the number of solutions in a broad class of
planted CSPs, the existence of a threshold function for the disassortative
stochastic block model, and the proof of a conjecture on parity check codes. It
also establishes new connections among coding, clustering and satisfiability.

to imply uniqueness and stable $L^2$ dependence on initial data of Lax 1- or

with convex entropy implies Lopatinski stability in the sense of Majda. This
means in particular that Leger and Vasseur's relative entropy condition
represents a considerable improvement over the standard entropy condition of
decreasing shock strength and increasing entropy along forward Hugoniot curves,
which, in a recent example exhibited by Barker, Freist\""uhler and Zumbrun, was
shown to fail to imply Lopatinski stability, even for systems with convex
entropy. This observation bears also on the parallel question of existence, at
least for small $BV$ or $H^s$ perturbations

a new formula for $p(t,\Delta)$. This formula allows us to obtain long time

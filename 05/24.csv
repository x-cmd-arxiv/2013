spherical SDSS galaxies at a mean redshift of 0.12 based on their aperture
velocity dispersions and newly derived luminosity profiles in conjunction with
published velocity dispersion profiles and empirical properties and relations
of galaxy and halo parameters. When two-component (i.e. stellar plus dark) mass
models are fitted to the SDSS aperture velocity dispersions, the predicted
velocity dispersion profile (VP) slopes within the effective radius R_eff match
well the distribution in observed elliptical galaxies. In contrast, the
single-component models cannot reproduce the VP slope distribution. From a
number of input variations the models exhibit for the radial range 0.1 R_eff <
r < R_eff a tight correlation <gamma_e>=(1.865+/-0.008)+(-4.93+/-0.15)<eta>
where <gamma_e> is the mean slope absolute value of the total mass density and
<eta> is the mean slope of the velocity dispersion profile, which leads to a
super-isothermal <gamma_e> = 2.15+/-0.04 for <eta>=-0.058+/-0.008 in observed
elliptical galaxies. Furthermore, the successful two-component models appear to
imply a typical slope curvature pattern in the total mass profile because for
the observed steep luminosity (stellar mass) profile and the weak lensing
inferred halo profile at large radii a total mass profile with monotonically
varying slope would require too high DM density in the optical region giving
rise to too large aperture velocity dispersion and too shallow VP.

undistorted one pion exchange. However, the cross section is grossly
underestimated for low Mx, even when Delta excitation in the projectile

usually applied to the solution of Boltzmann's equation, which uses a method of
characteristics in an integral form to project an initial cell forward to a
group of final cells. As such the CS is a `forward-trajectory' semi-Lagrangian
scheme. For multi-dimensional simulations of neutral gas flows, the
cell-centered version of this semi-Lagrangian (CCSL) scheme has advantages over
other options due to its implementation simplicity, low memory requirements,
and easier treatment of boundary conditions. The main drawback of the CCSL-CS
to date has been its high numerical diffusion in physical space, because of the
2$^{\text{nd}}$ order remapping that takes place at the end of each time step.
By means of a Modified Equation Analysis, it is shown that a high order
estimate of the remapping error can be obtained a priori, and a small
correction to the final position of the cells can be applied upon remapping, in
order to achieve full compensation of this error. The resulting scheme is
4$^{\text{th}}$ order accurate in space while retaining the desirable
properties of the CS: it is conservative and positivity-preserving, and the
overall algorithm complexity is not appreciably increased. Two monotone (i.e.
non-oscillating) versions of the fourth order CCSL-CS are also presented: one
uses a common flux-limiter approach; the other uses a non-polynomial
reconstruction to evaluate the derivatives of the density function. The method
is illustrated in simple one- and two-dimensional examples, and a fully 3D

interparticle interactions and novel band structures that deviate from those of
free particles. Strongly interacting systems, where both of these phenomena are
of equal importance, exhibit a variety of theoretically interesting and
practically useful phases. Systems of ultracold atoms are rapidly emerging as
precise and controllable simulators, and it is precisely in this strongly
interacting regime where simulation is the most useful. Here we demonstrate how
to hybridize Bloch bands in optical lattices to introduce long-range
ferromagnetic order in an itinerant atomic system. We find spontaneously broken
symmetry for bosons with a double-well dispersion condensing into one of two
distinct minima, which we identify with spin-up and spin-down. The density
dynamics following a rapid quench to the ferromagnetic state confirm quantum
interference between the two states as the mechanism for symmetry breaking.
Unlike spinor condensates, where interaction is driven by small spin-dependent
differences in scattering length, our interactions scale with the scattering
length itself, leading to domains which equilibrate rapidly and develop sharp
boundaries characteristic of a strongly interacting ferromagnet.

scientists. These include the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), a penalized
goodness-of-fit statistic, and the AICc, a variant including a small-sample
correction. They entered the physical sciences through being used by
astrophysicists to compare cosmological models; e.g., predictions of the
distance-redshift relation. The AICc is shown to have been misapplied, being
applicable only if error variances are unknown. If error bars accompany the

listed in an appendix. It is also shown how the variability of the AIC
difference between models with a known error variance can be estimated. This
yields a significance test that can potentially replace the use of `Akaike
weights' for deciding between such models. Additionally, the effects of model
misspecification are examined. For regression models fitted to data sets
without (rather than with) error bars, they are major: the AICc may be shifted
by an unknown amount. The extent of this in the fitting of physical models
remains to be studied.

after a sudden removal of the trapping potential using exact numerical methods.
As a main result, we show that in one dimension, both bosonic and fermionic
Mott insulators expand with the same velocity, irrespective of the interaction
strength, provided the expansion starts from the ground state of the trapped
gas. Furthermore, their density profiles become identical during the expansion:
The asymptotic density dynamics is identical to that of initially localized,
non-interacting particles, and the asymptotic velocity distribution is flat.
The expansion velocity for initial correlated Mott insulating states is
therefore independent of the interaction strength and particle statistics.
Interestingly, this non-equilibrium dynamics is sensitive to the interaction
driven quantum phase transition in the Bose-Hubbard model: While being constant
in the Mott phase, the expansion velocity decreases in the superfluid phase and
vanishes for large systems in the non-interacting limit. These results are
compared to the set-up of a recent experiment [PRL 110, 205301 (2013)], where
the trap opening was combined with an interaction quench from infinitely strong
interactions to finite values. We carry out an analogous analysis for a
two-component Fermi gas, with similar observations. In addition, we study the
effect of breaking the integrability of hard-core bosons in different ways:
While the fast ballistic expansion from the ground state of Mott insulators in
one dimension remains unchanged for finite interactions, we observe strong
deviations from this behavior on a two-leg ladder even in the hard-core case.
This change in dynamics bares similarities with the dynamics in the dimensional
crossover from one to two dimensions observed in the aformentioned experimental
study.

dual geometry with pressure anisotropy is generated from the axion-dilaton
gravity action introduced by Mateos and Trancancelli and the magnetic field is
coupled to fundamental matters(quarks) through the D3/D7 embeddings. We find
that the photon spectra with different quark mass are enhanced at large
frequency when the photons are emitted parallel to the anisotropic direction
with larger pressure or perpendicular to the magnetic field. However, in the
opposite conditions for the emitted directions, the spectra approximately
saturate isotropic results in the absence of magnetic field. On the other hand,
a resonance emerges at moderate frequency for the photon spectrum with heavy
quarks when the photons move perpendicular to the magnetic field. The resonance
is more robust when the photons are polarized along the magnetic field. On the
contrary, in the presence of pressure anisotropy, the resonance will be
suppressed. There exist competing effects of magnetic field and pressure
anisotropy on meson melting in the strongly coupled super Yang-Mills plasma,
while we argue that the suppression led by anisotropy may not be applied to the
quark gluon plasma.

distributed algorithms. We use a standard synchronous message passing model
where in each round, $O(\log n)$ bits can be transmitted over each edge (a.k.a.
the CONGEST model). We present a distributed algorithm that, for any weighted
graph and any $\epsilon \in (0, 1)$, with high probability finds a cut of size
at most $O(\epsilon^{-1}\lambda)$ in $O(D) + \tilde{O}(n^{1/2 + \epsilon})$
rounds, where $\lambda$ is the size of the minimum cut. This algorithm is based
on a simple approach for analyzing random edge sampling, which we call the
random layering technique. In addition, we also present another distributed
algorithm, which is based on a centralized algorithm due to Matula [SODA '93],
that with high probability computes a cut of size at most $(2+\epsilon)\lambda$
in $\tilde{O}((D+\sqrt{n})/\epsilon^5)$ rounds for any $\epsilon>0$.
  The time complexities of both of these algorithms almost match the
$\tilde{\Omega}(D + \sqrt{n})$ lower bound of Das Sarma et al. [STOC '11], thus
leading to an answer to an open question raised by Elkin [SIGACT-News '04] and
Das Sarma et al. [STOC '11].
  Furthermore, we also strengthen the lower bound of Das Sarma et al. by
extending it to unweighted graphs. We show that the same lower bound also holds
for unweighted multigraphs (or equivalently for weighted graphs in which
$O(w\log n)$ bits can be transmitted in each round over an edge of weight $w$),
even if the diameter is $D=O(\log n)$. For unweighted simple graphs, we show
that even for networks of diameter $\tilde{O}(\frac{1}{\lambda}\cdot
\sqrt{\frac{n}{\alpha\lambda}})$, finding an $\alpha$-approximate minimum cut
in networks of edge connectivity $\lambda$ or computing an
$\alpha$-approximation of the edge connectivity requires $\tilde{\Omega}(D +

modes which are singular on the past horizon of the south pole and decay
exponentially towards the future. These are found to lie in two complex
highest-weight representations of the dS_4 isometry group SO(4,1). The
Klein-Gordon norm cannot be used for quantization of these modes because it
diverges. However a modified `R-norm', which involves reflection across the
equator of a spatial S^3 slice, is nonsingular. The quasinormal modes are shown
to provide a complete orthogonal basis with respect to the R-norm. Adopting the
associated R-adjoint effectively transforms SO(4,1) to the symmetry group
SO(3,2) of a 2+1-dimensional CFT. It is further shown that the conventional
Euclidean vacuum may be defined as the state annihilated by half of the
quasinormal modes, and the Euclidean Green function obtained from a simple mode
sum. Quasinormal quantization contrasts with some conventional approaches in
that it maintains manifest dS-invariance throughout. The results are expected
to generalize to other dimensions and spins.

Taken together, these states constitute what we call a timeline, or quantum

Spot, firstly detected in the WMAP data by Vielva et al. (2004). In a later
paper, Vielva et al. (2011) developed a method to probe the anomalous nature of
the Cold Spot by using the cross-correlation of temperature and polarization of
the CMB fluctuations. Whereas this work was built under the assumption of
analysing full-sky data, in the present paper we extend such approach to deal
with realistic data sets with a partial sky-coverage. In particular, we exploit
the radial and tangential polarization patterns around temperature spots. We
explore the capacity of the method to distinguish between a standard Gaussian
CMB scenario and an alternative one, in which the Cold Spot arises from a
physical process that does not present correlated polarization features (e.g.,
topological defects), as a function of the instrumental-noise level. Moreover,
we consider more in detail the case of an ideal noise-free experiment and those
ones with the expected instrumental-noise levels in QUIJOTE and Planck
experiments. We also present an application to the 9-year WMAP data, without
being able to obtain firm conclusions, with a significance level of 32%. In the
ideal case, the alternative scenario could be rejected at a significance level
of around 1%, whereas for expected noise levels of QUIJOTE and Planck

on its properties. With a velocity dispersion $\sim$6 km s$^{-1}$, and under
the assumption that the galaxy is virialised, the mass-to-light ratio is found
to be approaching $\sim$2000 - apparently heavily dark matter dominated. Using
N-Body simulations, we demonstrate that the observed luminosity, ellipticity,
irregular morphology, velocity gradient, and the velocity dispersion can be
well reproduced through processes associated with tidal mass loss, and in the
absence of dark matter. These results highlight the considerable uncertainty
that exists in measurements of the dark matter content of Ursa Major II. The
dynamics of the inner tidal tails, and tidal stream, causes the observed
velocity dispersion of stars to be boosted to values of $>$5 km s$^{-1}$ ($>$20
km s$^{-1}$ at times). This effect is responsible for raising the velocity
dispersion of our model to the observed values in UMaII. We test an iterative
rejection technique for removing unbound stars from samples of UMaII stars
whose positions on the sky, and line-of-sight velocities, are provided. We find
this technique is very effective at providing an accurate bound mass from this
information, and only fails when the galaxy has a bound mass less than 10$%$ of
its initial mass. However when $<2%$ mass remains bound, mass overestimation by
$>$3 orders of magnitude are seen. Additionally we find that mass measurements
are sensitive to measurement uncertainty in line-of-sight velocities.
Measurement uncertainties of 1-4 km s$^{-1}$ result in mass overestimates by a
factor of $\sim$1.3-5.7.

simulations on Cartesian meshes as well as arbitrary static and moving Voronoi

volume (FV) approach. We demonstrate that the DG technique offers distinct
advantages over FV formulations on both static and moving meshes. The DG method
is also easily generalized to higher than second-order accuracy without
requiring the use of extended stencils to estimate derivatives (thereby making
the scheme highly parallelizable). We implement the technique in the AREPO code
for solving the fluid and the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. By examining
various test problems, we show that our new formulation provides improved
accuracy over FV approaches of the same order, and reduces post-shock
oscillations and artificial diffusion of angular momentum. In addition, the DG
method makes it possible to represent magnetic fields in a locally
divergence-free way, improving the stability of MHD simulations and moderating
global divergence errors, and is a viable alternative for solving the MHD
equations on meshes where Constrained-Transport (CT) cannot be applied. We find
that the DG procedure on a moving mesh is more sensitive to the choice of slope
limiter than is its FV method counterpart. Therefore, future work to improve
the performance of the DG scheme even further will likely involve the design of
optimal slope limiters. As presently constructed, our technique offers the

formation prescription regulated by the local H2 abundance leads to the
suppression of star formation in dwarf galaxy halos with M_h <~ 10^10 Msun and
to a large population of gas-rich ""dark galaxies"" at z=2.5 with low star
formation efficiencies and gas depletion timescales >20 Gyr. The fraction of
dark galaxies is 60% at M_h ~ 10^10 Msun and increases rapidly with decreasing
halo mass. Dark galaxies form late and their gaseous disks never reach the
surface densities, > ~5700 Msun / pc^2 (Z/10^-3 Zsun)^(-0.88), that are
required to build a substantial molecular fraction. Despite this large

consistent with both the observed luminosity function of galaxies and the
cosmological mass density of neutral gas at z>~2.5. Moreover, our results
provide a theoretical explanation for the recent detection in fluorescent
Ly-alpha emission of gaseous systems at high redshift with little or no

fresh solution to a number of outstanding ""dwarf galaxy problems"" in LambdaCDM.
In particular, H2-regulation leads galaxy formation to become effectively

suggests that two low-eccentricity Hill stable terrestrial-mass or smaller-mass

(in addition to rotation) in their photospheric spectral lines. This paper
examines the occurrence of such ""macro-turbulence"" in slowly rotating O-stars
with strong, organised surface magnetic fields. Focusing on the CIV 5811A line,
we find evidence for significant macro-turbulent broadening in all stars except
NGC1624-2, which also has (by far) the strongest magnetic field. Instead, the
very sharp CIV lines in NGC1624-2 are dominated by magnetic Zeeman broadening,
from which we estimate a dipolar field of approximately 20 kG. By contrast,
magnetic broadening is negligible in the other stars (due to their weaker field
strengths, on order 1 kG), and their CIV profiles are typically very broad and
similar to corresponding lines observed in non-magnetic O-stars. Quantifying
this by an isotropic, Gaussian macro-turbulence, we derive vmac = 2.2 (+-
0.9/2.2) km/s for NGC1624-2, and vmac = 20-65 km/s for the rest of the magnetic
sample. We use these observational results to test the hypothesis that the
field can stabilise the atmosphere and suppress the generation of
macro-turbulence down to stellar layers where the magnetic pressure PB and the
gas pressure Pg are comparable. Using a simple grey atmosphere to estimate the
temperature T0 at which PB = Pg, we find that T0 > Teff for all investigated
magnetic stars, but that T0 reaches the ~160000 K layers associated with the
iron opacity-bump in hot stars only for NGC1624-2. This is consistent with the
view that the responsible physical mechanism for photospheric O-star
macro-turbulence may be stellar gravity-mode oscillations excited by
sub-surface convection zones, and suggests that a sufficiently strong magnetic
field can suppress such iron-bump generated convection and associated
pulsational excitation.

in determining its quantum transport properties. Previous reports have shown
that an axial magnetic field induces flux-periodic conductance oscillations
when the electronic states are confined to a shell. This effect is due to the
coupling of orbital angular momentum to the magnetic flux. Here, we perform
calculations of the energy level structure, and consequently the conductance,
for more general cases ranging from a flat potential to strong surface band
bending. The transverse states are not confined to a shell, but are distributed
across the nanowire. It is found that, in general, the subband energy spectrum
is aperiodic as a function of both gate voltage and magnetic field. In
principle, this allows for precise identification of the occupied subbands from
the magnetoconductance patterns of quasi-ballistic devices. The aperiodicity
becomes more apparent as the potential flattens. A quantitative method is
introduced for matching features in the conductance data to the subband
structure resulting from a particular radial potential, where a functional form
for the potential is used that depends on two free parameters. Finally, a
short-channel InAs nanowire FET device is measured at low temperature in search
of conductance features that reveal the subband structure. Features are
identified and shown to be consistent with three specific subbands. The
experiment is analyzed in the context of the weak localization regime, however,
we find that the subband effects predicted for ballistic transport should
remain visible when back scattering dominates over interband scattering, as is
expected for this device.

This paper presents the first explicit major results on the topology of
intervals in this poset. We show that almost all (open) intervals in this poset
have a disconnected subinterval and are thus not shellable. Nevertheless, there
seem to be large classes of intervals that are shellable and thus have the
homotopy type of a wedge of spheres. We prove this to be the case for all
intervals of layered permutations that have no disconnected subintervals of
rank 3 or more. We also characterize in a simple way those intervals of layered
permutations that are disconnected. These results carry over to the poset of
generalized subword order when the ordering on the underlying alphabet is a
rooted forest. We conjecture that the same applies to intervals of separable
permutations, that is, that such an interval is shellable if and only if it has
no disconnected subinterval of rank 3 or more. We also present a simplified
version of the recursive formula for the M\""obius function of decomposable
permutations given by Burstein et al.

stellar debris returns to the disruption site and circularizes. Rather than
being confined within the circularizing radius, the disk can spread to larger
radii to conserve angular momentum. A spreading disk is a source of matter for
re-accretion at rates which can exceed the later stellar fallback rate,
although a disk wind can suppress its contribution to the central black hole
accretion rate. A spreading disk is detectible through a break in the central
accretion rate history, or, at longer wavelengths, by its own emission. We
model the evolution of TDE disk size and accretion rate, by accounting for the
time-dependent fallback rate, for the influence of wind losses in the early,
advective stage, and for the possibility of thermal instability for accretion
rates intermediate between the advection-dominated and gas-pressure dominated
states. The model provides a dynamic basis for modeling TDE light curves. All
or part of a young TDE disk will precess as a solid body due to Lense-Thirring
effect, and precession may manifest itself as quasi-periodic modulation of
light curve. The precession period increases with time. Applying our results to
the jetted TDE candidate Swift J1644+57, whose X-ray light curve shows numerous
quasi-periodic dips, we argue that the data best fit a scenario in which a
main-sequence star was fully disrupted by an intermediate mass black hole on an
orbit significantly inclined from the black hole equator, with the apparent jet
shutoff at t= 500 d corresponding to a disk transition from the advective state
to the gas-pressure dominated state.

define cardinal points on the circumference of the cylinder and consider a

direction South-North. The orbital motion of the electrons depends on the
radial component of the field which is not uniform around the circumference: it
is equal to the total field at North and South, but vanishes at the West and
East sides. For a strong field, when the magnetic length is comparable to the
radius of the cylinder, the electronic states at North and South become
localized cyclotron orbits, whereas at East and West the states become long and
narrow snaking orbits propagating along the cylinder. The energy of the
cyclotron states increases with the magnetic field whereas the energy of the
snaking states is stable. Consequently, at high magnetic fields the electron
density vanishes at North and South and concentrates at East and West. We
include spin-orbit interaction with linear Rashba and Dresselhaus models. For a
cylinder of finite length the Dresselhaus interaction produces an axial twist
of the charge density relative to the center of the wire, which may be
amplified in the presence of the Rashba interaction.

number of non-zero entries of $M$. This generalizes all previous oblivious

  We apply our results to $\ell_p$-regression, obtaining a

the best known $\poly(d/\eps)$ factors for every $p \in [1, \infty) \setminus

$(1+\eps)$-approximation to $\ell_p$-regression, a corollary of our results is
that for all $p \in [1, \infty)$ we can solve the $\ell_p$-regression problem
without using general convex programming, that is, since our subspace embeds
into $\ell_{\infty}$ it suffices to solve a linear programming problem.
Finally, we give the first protocols for the distributed $\ell_p$-regression
problem for every $p \geq 1$ which are nearly optimal in communication and

the onset of order and information transmission in prebiotic systems. A

Remarkably, measured forces are found to be a precise vector sum (directional
bonding) of cohesive forces between the central and adjacently coordinated

from load balancing, by which mobile users are pushed onto lightly-loaded small
cells despite the resulting loss in SINR. This offloading can be made more
aggressive and robust if the macrocells leave a fraction of time/frequency
resource blank, which reduces the interference to the offloaded users. We
investigate the joint optimization of this technique - referred to in 3GPP as
enhanced intercell interference coordination (eICIC) via almost blank subframes
(ABSs) - with offloading in this paper. Although the joint cell association and
blank resource (BR) problem is nominally combinatorial, by allowing users to
associate with multiple base stations (BSs), the problem becomes convex, and
upper bounds the performance versus a binary association. We show both
theoretically and through simulation that the optimal solution of the relaxed
problem still results in an association that is mostly binary. The optimal
association differs significantly when the macrocell is on or off; in
particular the offloading can be much more aggressive when the resource is left
blank by macro BSs. Further, we observe that jointly optimizing the offloading
with BR is important. The rate gain for cell edge users (the worst 3-10%) is
very large - on the order of 5-10x - versus a naive association strategy
without macrocell blanking.

networks that exploit mutual information accumulation as the physical layer
transmission scheme, and are capable of routing multiple packet streams
(commodities) when only the average channel state information is present and
that only locally. The proposed algorithms are modifications of the Diversity
Backpressure (DIVBAR) algorithm, under which the packet whose commodity has the
largest ""backpressure metric"" is chosen to be transmitted and is forwarded
through the link with the largest differential backlog (queue length). In
contrast to traditional DIVBAR, each receiving node stores and accumulates the
partially received packet in a separate ""partial packet queue"", thus increasing
the probability of successful reception during a later possible retransmission.
We present two variants of the algorithm: DIVBAR-RMIA, under which all the
receiving nodes clear the received partial information of a packet once one or
more receiving nodes firstly decode the packet; and DIVBAR-MIA, under which all
the receiving nodes retain the partial information of a packet until the packet
has reached its destination. We characterize the network capacity region with
RMIA and prove that (under certain mild conditions) it is strictly larger than

is used by the traditional DIVBAR. We also prove that DIVBAR-RMIA is
throughput-optimum among the polices with RMIA, i.e., it achieves the network
capacity region with RMIA, which in turn demonstrates that DIVBAR-RMIA
outperforms traditional DIVBAR on the achievable throughput. Moreover, we prove
that DIVBAR-MIA performs at least as well as DIVBAR-RMIA with respect to
throughput. Simulations also confirm these results.

2006 December 13, accompanied by a high flux of energetic particles recorded

evidence of flare acceleration in a major solar energetic particle (SEP) event.
We first present observations from ACE/EPAM, GOES, and the Apatity neutron
monitor. It is found that the initial particle release time coincides with the
flare emission and that the spectrum becomes softer and the anisotropy becomes
weaker during particle injection, indicating that the acceleration source
changes from a confined coronal site to a widespread interplanetary CME-driven
shock. We then describe a comprehensive study of the associated flare active
region. By use of imaging data from HINODE/SOT and SOHO/MDI magnetogram, we
infer the flare magnetic reconnection rate in the form of the magnetic flux
change rate. This correlates in time with the microwave emission, indicating a
physical link between the flare magnetic reconnection and the acceleration of
nonthermal particles. Combining radio spectrograph data from Huairou/NOAC,
Culgoora/IPS, Learmonth/RSTN, and WAVES/WIND leads to a continuous and
longlasting radio burst extending from a few GHz down to several kHz. Based on
the photospheric vector magnetogram from Huairou/NOAC and the nonlinear force
free field (NFFF) reconstruction method, we derive the 3D magnetic field
configuration shortly after the eruption. Furthermore, we also compute coronal
field lines extending to a few solar radii using a potential-field
source-surface (PFSS) model. Both the so-called type III-l burst and the
magnetic field configuration suggest that open-field lines extend from the
flare active region into interplanetary space, allowing the accelerated and
charged particles escape.

flattened clumps oriented parallel to the photosphere provide poor fits to
observed line shapes. However, porosity models with isotropic clumps can
provide acceptable fits to observed line shapes, but only if the porosity
effect is moderate. We quantify the degeneracy between porosity effects from
isotropic clumps and the mass-loss rate inferred from the X-ray line shapes,
and we show that only modest increases in the mass-loss rate (<~ 40%) are
allowed if moderate porosity effects (h_infinity <~ R_*) are assumed to be
important. Large porosity lengths, and thus strong porosity effects, are ruled
out regardless of assumptions about clump shape. Thus, X-ray mass-loss rate

long-range dipolar interactions are expected to facilitate the understanding of
strongly interacting many-body quantum systems and to realize lattice spin
models for exploring quantum magnetism. In atomic systems, where interactions
require wave function overlap, effective spin interactions on a lattice can be
realized via superexchange; however, the coupling is weak and limited to
nearest-neighbor interactions. In contrast, dipolar interactions exist in the
absence of tunneling and extend beyond nearest neighbors. This allows coherent
spin dynamics to persist even at high entropy and low lattice filling. Effects
of dipolar interactions in ultracold molecular gases have so far been limited
to the modification of chemical reactions. We now report the observation of
dipolar interactions of polar molecules pinned in a 3D optical lattice. We
realize a lattice spin model with spin encoded in rotational states, prepared
and probed by microwaves. This spin-exchange interaction arises from the
resonant exchange of rotational angular momentum between two molecules. We
observe clear oscillations in the evolution of the spin coherence in addition
to an overall decay. The frequency of these oscillations, the strong dependence
of the spin coherence time on the lattice filling, and the effect of a
multi-pulse sequence designed to reverse dynamics due to two-body exchange
interactions all provide evidence of dipolar interactions. We also demonstrate
suppression of loss in weak lattices due to a quantum Zeno mechanism.
Measurements of these tunneling-induced losses allow us to independently
determine the lattice filling factor. These results comprise an initial
exploration of the behavior of many-body spin models with direct, long-range
spin interactions and lay the groundwork for future studies of many-body
dynamics in spin lattices.

small interatomic distance, the effective charge of the nuclei approaches the
critical charge where the ground state dives into the negative continuum. This
facilitates the transition from the negative to the positive energy states,
which in turns, increases the pair production rate. At larger atomic distance,
the enhancement is due to the crossing of resonances and the pair production
proceeds by the Resonantly Enhanced Pair Production (REPP) mechanism. These
processes are studied within a simple one-dimensional model. A numerical method
is developed to evaluate the transmission coefficient in relativistic quantum
mechanics, which is required in the calculation of the pair production rate.
The latter is evaluated for systems with many (up to five) nuclei. It is shown

  in IaaS Clouds","Part of this paper has appeared in USENIX ICAC 2013",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) clouds offer diverse instance purchasing
options. A user can either run instances on demand and pay only for what it
uses, or it can prepay to reserve instances for a long period, during which a
usage discount is entitled. An important problem facing a user is how these two
instance options can be dynamically combined to serve time-varying demands at
minimum cost. Existing strategies in the literature, however, require either
exact knowledge or the distribution of demands in the long-term future, which
significantly limits their use in practice. Unlike existing works, we propose
two practical online algorithms, one deterministic and another randomized, that
dynamically combine the two instance options online without any knowledge of
the future. We show that the proposed deterministic (resp., randomized)
algorithm incurs no more than 2-alpha (resp., e/(e-1+alpha)) times the minimum
cost obtained by an optimal offline algorithm that knows the exact future a
priori, where alpha is the entitled discount after reservation. Our online
algorithms achieve the best possible competitive ratios in both the
deterministic and randomized cases, and can be easily extended to cases when
short-term predictions are reliable. Simulations driven by a large volume of
real-world traces show that significant cost savings can be achieved with
prevalent IaaS prices.

plateau of high-order terahertz sideband generation (HSG) in semiconductors
driven by intense terahertz (THz) fields. We find that the plateau of the
sideband spectrum strongly depends on the detuning between the NIR laser field
and the band gap. We use the quantum trajectory theory (three-step model) to
understand the HSG. In the three-step model, an electron-hole pair is first
excited by a weak laser, then driven by the strong THz field, and finally
recombine to emit a photon with energy gain. When the laser is tuned below the
band gap (negative detuning), the electron-hole generation is a virtual process
that requires quantum tunneling to occur. When the energy gained by the
electron-hole pair from the THz field is less than 3.2 times the ponderomotive
energy, the electron and the hole can be driven to the same position and
recombine without quantum tunneling, so the HSG will have large probability
amplitude. This leads to a plateau feature of the HSG spectrum with a
high-frequency cutoff at about 3.2 times the ponderomotive energy above the
band gap. Such a plateau feature is similar to the case of high-order harmonics
generation in atoms where electrons have to overcome the binding energy to
escape the atomic core. A particularly interesting excitation condition in HSG
is that the laser can be tuned above the band gap (positive detuning),
corresponding to the unphysical ""negative"" binding energy in atoms for
high-order harmonic generation. Now the electron-hole pair is generation by
real excitation, but the recombination process can be real or virtual depending
on the energy gained from the THz field, which determines the plateau feature
in HSG.

with the Urumqi 25m radio telescope at 4.8 GHz. The source has shown prominent
IDV of total flux density in most observing sessions with variability
timescales of <= 1 day at 4.8 GHz. The estimated IDV timescales seem to follow
an annual cycle that can be fitted with an anisotropic interstellar
scintillation (ISS) model suggesting that a significant part of the flux
density variations is due to ISS. The source underwent a dramatic flare in
2008. We studied the possible consequences of the flare on the IDV of 1156+295
by comparing the changes in its IDV characteristics with the evolution of the

The quasar 1156+295 shows evidence for an annual modulation of its IDV
timescales at 4.8 GHz, the ISS-induced IDV timescales and variability strength
might be affected by the overall activity state of the source core. More

a probabilistic part which is mainly concerned with weak convergence of
sequential empirical processes, and an analytic part providing general ways to
extend this weak convergence to functionals of the sequential empirical
process. Our theory provides a unified treatment of asymptotic distributions
for a large class of statistics, including recently proposed self-normalized
statistics and sub-sampling based p-values. In addition, we comment on the
consistency of bootstrap procedures and obtain general results on compact
differentiability of certain mappings that seem to be of independent interest.

collisionless shocks in the laboratory. Using the plasma jet initial conditions

interactions between the two jets are essentially collisionless at the merge
region. In highly resolved one- and two-dimensional simulations, we show that
collisionless shocks are generated by the merging jets when immersed in applied
magnetic fields (B ~ 0.1-1 kG). At expected plasma jet speeds of up to 100
km/s, our simulations do not give rise to unmagnetized collisionless shocks,
which require much higher velocities. The orientation of the magnetic field and
the axial and transverse density gradients of the jets have a strong effect on
the nature of the interaction. We compare some of our simulation results with

infer the radial differential rotation profile of subgiants and red giants.
  Aims. We want to reproduce through modeling the observed rotation profile of
the early red giant KIC 7341231 and constrain the physical mechanisms
responsible for angular momentum transport in stellar interiors.
  Methods. We compute models of KIC 7341231 including a treatment of shellular
rotation and we compare the rotation profiles obtained with the one derived by
Deheuvels et al. (2012). We then modify some modeling parameters in order to
quantify their effect on the obtained rotation profile. Moreover, we mimic a
powerful angular momentum transport during the Main Sequence and study its
effect on the evolution of the rotation profile during the subgiant and red
giant phases.
  Results. We show that meridional circulation and shear mixing alone produce a
rotation profile for KIC 7341231 too steep compared to the observed one. An
additional mechanism is then needed to increase the internal transport of
angular momentum. We find that this undetermined mechanism has to be efficient
not only during the Main Sequence but also during the much quicker subgiant
phase. Moreover, we point out the importance of studying the whole rotational
history of a star in order to explain its rotation profile during the red giant
evolution.

Lyr recorded by Kepler did not show a precursor outburst and the superhumps
developed only after the maximum light, a first example in the Kepler data so
far. Such a superoutburst is understood within the thermal-tidal instability
model. The observation of V585 Lyr made the first clear Kepler detection of the
positive period derivative commonly seen in the ""stage B"" superhumps in dwarf
novae with short orbital periods. In all objects, there was no strong signature
of a transition to the dominating stream impact-type component of superhumps,
suggesting that there is no strong indication of an enhanced mass-transfer
following the superoutburst. We have determined the orbital period of V516 Lyr
to be 0.083999(8) d. In V516 Lyr, some of outbursts were double outbursts in a
various degree. The preceding outburst in the double outburst was of the
inside-out nature while the following one was of the outside-in nature. One of
superoutbursts in V516 Lyr was preceded by a double precursor. The preceding

triggered a superoutburst by developing positive superhumps.

to the evaluation of photometric redshifts for quasars. The data set used for
the experiment was obtained by merging four different surveys (SDSS, GALEX,
UKIDSS and WISE), thus covering a wide range of wavelengths from the UV to the
mid-infrared. The method is able i) to achieve a very high accuracy; ii) to
drastically reduce the number of outliers and catastrophic objects; iii) to
discriminate among parameters (or features) on the basis of their significance,
so that the number of features used for training and analysis can be optimized
in order to reduce both the computational demands and the effects of
degeneracy. The best experiment, which makes use of a selected combination of
parameters drawn from the four surveys, leads, in terms of DeltaZnorm (i.e.
(zspec-zphot)/(1+zspec)), to an average of DeltaZnorm = 0.004, a standard
deviation sigma = 0.069 and a Median Absolute Deviation MAD = 0.02 over the
whole redshift range (i.e. zspec <= 3.6), defined by the 4-survey cross-matched
spectroscopic sample. The fraction of catastrophic outliers, i.e. of objects
with photo-z deviating more than 2sigma from the spectroscopic value is < 3%,
leading to a sigma = 0.035 after their removal, over the same redshift range.

problems related to the electromagnetic behavior of thin superconductors. Here
all the problems are reduced to finding the weight functions for the Green
integrals that represent the magnetic field components; these latter must
satisfy the mixed boundary value conditions that naturally arise from the
critical state assumptions. The use of the Erd\'elyi-Kober operators and of the
Hankel transforms (and mostly the employment of their composition properties)
is the keystone to unify the method toward the solution. In fact, the procedure
consists always of the same steps and does not require any peculiar invention.
For this reason the method, here presented in detail for the simplest cases
that can be handled in analytical way (two parts boundary), can be directly
extended to many other more complex geometries (three or more parts), which
usually will require a numerical treatment. In this paper we use the operator
technique to derive the current density and field distributions in perfectly
conducting and superconducting thin discs and tapes subjected to a uniform
magnetic field or carrying a transport current. Although analytical expressions
for the field and current distributions have already been found by other
authors in the past by using several other methods, their derivation is often
cumbersome or missing key details, which makes it difficult for the reader to
fully understand the derivation of the analytical formulas and, more
importantly, to extend the same methods to solve similar new problems. On the
contrary, the characterization of these cases as mixed boundary conditions has
the advantage of referring to an immediate and na\""ive translation of physics
into a consistent mathematical formulation whose possible extension to other
cases is self-evident.

functioning of a quantum device scales as 2^n for n qubits and requires
classical computational resources ~ n^2 2^{3n}. This represents an exponential
reduction compared to the best currently available protocol, Monte Carlo
characterization. The reduction comes at the price of either having to prepare
entangled input states or obtaining bounds rather than the average fidelity
itself. It is achieved by applying Monte Carlo sampling to so-called
two-designs or two classical fidelities. For the specific case of Clifford
gates, the original version of Monte Carlo characterization based on the
channel-state isomorphism remains an optimal choice. We provide a
classification of the available efficient strategies for device
characterization in terms of the number of required experimental settings,
average number of actual measurements and classical computational resources.

are usually attributed to the turbulent dynamo action. This is generally
derived employing a collisional MHD model. However, in the ICM the ion mean
free path between collisions is of the order of the dynamical scales, thus
requiring a collisionless MHD description. Unlike collisional MHD simulations,
our study uses an anisotropic plasma pressure with respect to the direction of
the local magnetic field, which brings the plasma within a parameter space
where collisionless instabilities should take place. Within the adopted model
these instabilities are contained at bay through the relaxation term of the
pressure anisotropy which simulates the feedback of the mirror and firehose
instabilities. This relaxation acts to get the plasma distribution function
consistent with the empirical studies of collisionless plasmas. Our 3D
numerical simulations of forced transonic turbulence motivated by modeling of
the turbulent ICM are performed for different initial values of the magnetic
field intensity, and different relaxation rates of the pressure anisotropy. We
found that in the high beta plasma regime corresponding to the ICM conditions,
a fast anisotropy relaxation rate gives results which are similar to the
collisional-MHD model as far as the statistical properties of the turbulence
are concerned. Also, the amplification of seed magnetic fields due to the
turbulent dynamo action is similar to the collisional-MHD model. Our
simulations that do not employ the anisotropy relaxation deviate significantly
from the collisional-MHD results, and show more power at the small-scale
fluctuations of both density and velocity representing the results of the
instabilities. For these simulations the large scale fluctuations in the
magnetic field are mostly suppressed and the turbulent dynamo fails in
amplifying seed magnetic fields.

concatenated error-detecting codes and postselection with a simulated error
threshold of 3% over the depolarizing channel. %We design a two-dimensional
architecture for fault-tolerant quantum computation based on Knill's
postselection scheme. We show how to use Knill's postselection scheme in a
practical two-dimensional quantum architecture that we designed with the goal
to optimize the error correction properties, while satisfying important
architectural constraints. In our 2D architecture, one logical qubit is
embedded in a tile consisting of $5\times 5$ physical qubits. The movement of
these qubits is modeled as noisy SWAP gates and the only physical operations
that are allowed are local one- and two-qubit gates. We evaluate the practical
properties of our design, such as its error threshold, and compare it to the
concatenated Bacon-Shor code and the concatenated Steane code. Assuming that
all gates have the same error rates, we obtain a threshold of $3.06\times
10^{-4}$ in a local adversarial stochastic noise model, which is the highest
known error threshold for concatenated codes in 2D. We also present a Monte
Carlo simulation of the 2D architecture with depolarizing noise and we
calculate a pseudo-threshold of about 0.1%. With memory error rates one-tenth
of the worst gate error rates, the threshold for the adversarial noise model,
and the pseudo-threshold over depolarizing noise, are $4.06\times 10^{-4}$ and
0.2%, respectively. In a hypothetical technology where memory error rates are
negligible, these thresholds can be further increased by shrinking the tiles
into a $4\times 4$ layout.

independent of the grand canonical particle number fluctuations. We explore the
validity of such grand canonical extrapolation for different fragmentation
observables in the framework of the analytical Grand Canonical or Canonical
Thermodynamical Model [(G)CTM] of nuclear multifragmentation. It is found that
corrections to the grand canonical expectations can be evaluated with high
precision, provided the system does not experience a first order phase
transition. In particular, because of the Coulomb quenching of the liquid-gas

performances of an alert system integrated into the CPOE/EMR system for renally
cleared drug dosing control. The generated alerts were compared with the daily
routine practice of pharmacists as part of the analysis of medication orders.
Materials and Methods: The pharmacists performed their analysis of medication
orders as usual and were not aware of the alert system interventions that were
not displayed for the purpose of the study neither to the physician nor to the
pharmacist but kept with associate recommendations in a log file. A senior
pharmacist analyzed the results of medication order analysis with and without
the alert system. The unit of analysis was the drug prescription line. The
primary study endpoints were the detection of drug-dose prescription errors and
inter-rater reliability between the alert system and the pharmacists in the
detection of drug dose error. Results: The alert system fired alerts in 8.41%
(421/5006) of cases: 5.65% (283/5006) exceeds max daily dose alerts and 2.76%
(138/5006) under dose alerts. The alert system and the pharmacists showed a
relatively poor concordance: 0.106 (CI 95% [0.068, 0.144]). According to the
senior pharmacist review, the alert system fired more appropriate alerts than
pharmacists, and made fewer errors than pharmacists in analyzing drug dose
prescriptions: 143 for the alert system and 261 for the pharmacists. Unlike the
alert system, most diagnostic errors made by the pharmacists were false
negatives. The pharmacists were not able to analyze a significant number (2097;
25.42%) of drug prescription lines because understaffing. Conclusion: This
study strongly suggests that an alert system would be complementary to the
pharmacists activity and contribute to drug prescription safety.

  International Conference at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, April
  29-May 1 2013",,,,"hep-ph hep-ex hep-lat","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Kaon physics provides a unique opportunity to identify new flavour and CP
violating interactions beyond the Standard Model (SM). In the SM, implied by
the hierarchical structure of the CKM matrix and the GIM mechanism, flavour
changing neutral current processes are most strongly suppressed in the kaon
sector while the suppression is much less effective in the B meson systems.
Thus their theoretical cleanness makes rare K decays, in particular the K -> pi
nu anti-nu system, extremely well suited to look for deviations from their tiny
SM values. Despite the increasingly stringent constraints on new physics from
direct search experiments as well as indirect searches in B meson decays, large
enhancements of both K^+ -> pi^+ nu anti-nu and K_L -> pi^0 nu anti-nu are
still possible, and deviations from the SM could be observed even for a
multi-TeV new physics scale. In addition the correlation betweeen the charged
and neutral K -> pi nu anti-nu modes provides insight on the new physics
operator structure in K^0 - anti-K^0 mixing and its interplay with rare K
decays. Useful model-discriminating correlations exist also in the K_L -> pi^0
l^+ l^- system. Finally the K -> l nu decays provide a clean test of lepton
universality and place constraints on new physics complementary to the ones
obtained from the searches for charged lepton flavour violating decays.

at the outer boundary of the dead zone of a protoplanetary disc by means of 2D
hydrodynamic simulations done with the graphics processor unit version of the
FARGO code. In the dead zone, the effective viscosity is greatly reduced due to
the disc self-shielding against stellar UV radiation, X-rays from the stellar
magnetosphere and interstellar cosmic rays. As a consequence, mass accumulation
occurs near the outer dead zone edge, which is assumed to trap planetary cores
enhancing the efficiency of the core-accretion scenario to form giant planets.
Contrary to the perfect trapping of planetary cores in 1D models, our 2D
numerical simulations show that the trapping effect is greatly dependent on the
width of the region where viscosity reduction is taking place. Planet trapping
happens exclusively if the viscosity reduction is sharp enough to allow the
development of large-scale vortices due to the Rossby wave instability. The
trapping is only temporarily, and its duration is inversely proportional to the
width of the viscosity transition. However, if the Rossby wave instability is
not excited, a ring-like axisymmetric density jump forms, which cannot trap the
10 Earth-mass planetary cores. We revealed that the stellar torque exerted on
the planet plays an important role in the migration history as the barycentre
of the system significantly shifts away from the star due to highly
non-axisymmetric density distribution of the disc. Our results still support
the idea of planet formation at density/pressure maximum, since the migration
of cores is considerably slowed down enabling them further growth and runaway
gas accretion in the vicinity of an overdense region.

randomized experiments, the estimated overall average causal effect alone is
often of limited value and the researchers must investigate when the treatments
do and do not work. Indeed, the estimation of treatment effect heterogeneity
plays an essential role in (1) selecting the most effective treatment from a
large number of available treatments, (2) ascertaining subpopulations for which
a treatment is effective or harmful, (3) designing individualized optimal
treatment regimes, (4) testing for the existence or lack of heterogeneous
treatment effects, and (5) generalizing causal effect estimates obtained from
an experimental sample to a target population. In this paper, we formulate the
estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects as a variable selection problem.
We propose a method that adapts the Support Vector Machine classifier by
placing separate sparsity constraints over the pre-treatment parameters and
causal heterogeneity parameters of interest. The proposed method is motivated
by and applied to two well-known randomized evaluation studies in the social
sciences. Our method selects the most effective voter mobilization strategies
from a large number of alternative strategies, and it also identifies the
characteristics of workers who greatly benefit from (or are negatively affected
by) a job training program. In our simulation studies, we find that the
proposed method often outperforms some commonly used alternatives.

becoming a crucial challenge, especially for long cumulated observation times.
The INTEGRAL/SPI X-gamma-ray spectrometer is an instrument for which it is
essential to process many exposures at the same time in order to increase the
low signal-to-noise ratio of the weakest sources. In this context, the
conventional methods for data reduction are inefficient and sometimes not
feasible at all. Processing several years of data simultaneously requires
computing not only the solution of a large system of equations, but also the
associated uncertainties. We aim at reducing the computation time and the
memory usage. Since the SPI transfer function is sparse, we have used some
popular methods for the solution of large sparse linear systems; we briefly
review these methods. We use the Multifrontal Massively Parallel Solver (MUMPS)
to compute the solution of the system of equations. We also need to compute the
variance of the solution, which amounts to computing selected entries of the
inverse of the sparse matrix corresponding to our linear system. This can be
achieved through one of the latest features of the MUMPS software that has been
partly motivated by this work. In this paper we provide a brief presentation of
this feature and evaluate its effectiveness on astrophysical problems requiring
the processing of large datasets simultaneously, such as the study of the
entire emission of the Galaxy. We used these algorithms to solve the large
sparse systems arising from SPI data processing and to obtain both their
solutions and the associated variances. In conclusion, thanks to these newly
developed tools, processing large datasets arising from SPI is now feasible
with both a reasonable execution time and a low memory usage.

for which recovering source intensity variations is not straightforward and can
constitute a difficulty for data analysis. In most cases, determining the
source intensity changes between exposures is largely based on a priori
information. We propose techniques that help to overcome the difficulty related
to source intensity variations, which make this step more rational. In
addition, the constructed ""synthetic"" light curves should permit us to obtain a
sky model that describes the data better and optimizes the source
signal-to-noise ratios. For this purpose, the time intensity variation of each
source was modeled as a combination of piecewise segments of time during which
a given source exhibits a constant intensity. To optimize the signal-to-noise
ratios, the number of segments was minimized. We present a first method that
takes advantage of previous time series that can be obtained from another
instrument on-board the INTEGRAL observatory. A data segmentation algorithm was
then used to synthesize the time series into segments. The second method no
longer needs external light curves, but solely SPI raw data. For this, we
developed a specific algorithm that involves the SPI transfer function. The
time segmentation algorithms that were developed solve a difficulty inherent to
the SPI instrument, which is the intensity variations of sources between
exposures, and it allows us to obtain more information about the sources'
behavior.

whose removal from $G$ results in a graph with larger domination number. An
orientable surface $\mathbb{S}_h$ of genus $h$, $h \geq 0$, is obtained from
the sphere $\mathbb{S}_0$ by adding $h$ handles. A non-orientable surface
$\mathbb{N}_q$ of genus $q$, $q \geq 1$, is obtained from the sphere by adding
$q$ crosscaps. The Euler characteristic of a surface is defined by
$\chi(\mathbb{S}_h) = 2 - 2h$ and $\chi(\mathbb{S}_q)= 2-q$. Let $G$ be a
connected graph of order $n$ which is 2-cell embedded on a surface $\mathbb{M}$
with $\chi(\mathbb{M})= \chi$. We prove that $b(G) \leq 7+i$ when $\mathbb{M} =

upper bounds on the bondage number at least when $-7\chi/(\delta(G) - 5) < n

if $\delta (G) = \delta \geq 6$, $\chi \leq -1$ and $-14\chi < \delta - 4 +
2(\delta -5)n$ then $b(G) \leq 2\delta -2$. We show that if $\gamma (G) =
\gamma \not = 2$, where $\gamma (G)$ is the domination number of $G$, then $n
\geq \gamma + (1 + \sqrt{9+8\gamma-8\chi})/2$; the bound is tight. We also
present upper bounds for the bondage number of graphs in terms of the girth,
domination number and Euler characteristic. As a corollary we prove that if
$\gamma(G) \geq 4$ and $\chi \leq -1$, then $b(G) \leq 11 - 24\chi/(9 +

spectral synthesis to model the corona in an observed solar active region. This
will allow us to judge the merits of the coronal heating mechanism built into
the 3D model. Methods. Photospheric observations of the magnetic field and
horizontal velocities in an active region are used to drive our coronal
simulation from the bottom. The currents induced by this heat the corona
through Ohmic dissipation. Heat conduction redistributes the energy that is
lost in the end through optically thin radiation. Based on the MHD model, we
synthesized profiles of coronal emission lines which can be directly compared
to actual coronal observations of the very same active region. Results. In the
synthesized model data we find hot coronal loops which host siphon flows or
which expand and lose mass through draining. These synthesized loops are at the
same location as and show similar dynamics in terms of Doppler shifts to the
observed structures. This match is shown through a comparison with Hinode data
as well as with 3D stereoscopic reconstructions of data from STEREO.
Conclusions. The considerable match to the actual observations shows that the
field-line braiding mechanism leading to the energy input in our corona
provides the proper distribution of heat input in space and time. From this we
conclude that in an active region the field-line braiding is the dominant
heating process, at least at the spatial scales available to current
observations.

example in case of (laser) excited ferromagnetic metals majority and minority
electrons may respond differently in time during closing the exchange
splitting. Spin flip transitions of the hot electrons due to electron
interactions cause quasi hybridization of the spin split states. This is also
the case in itinerant ferromagnetic metals due to hopping between sites having
magnetic moments pointing in direction of the magnetization (+) and opposite
direction (-) and with energy levels $\varepsilon^+_{i\sigma}$ and
$\varepsilon^-_{i\sigma}$. For energetic reasons the molecular field acts
asymmetrically on the spins of the electrons and on spin flip transitions and
thus causes different lifetimes of minority and majority electrons and spin
dependent electron energy shifts. Quite general minority hot electrons in spin
split states may respond faster than majority electrons at non--equilibrium.
The molecular field acting on the spins delays spin flip transitions $\uparrow
\rightarrow \downarrow$ and thus a response of the hot majority electrons and
their energy levels. The closing of the exchange splitting in the electron
spectrum of ferromagnetic transition and rare--earth metals, ferromagnetic
semiconductors, spin split quantum well states in thin ferromagnetic films,
etc. will reflect this. The time and spin dependent energy shifts of electrons
at non--equilibrium may cause interesting behavior, in particular of magnetic

lifetime of (local) magnetic moments parallel to the global magnetization is
larger than of moments pointing in opposite direction.

statistical applications. This paper discusses an approximation of the
likelihood in these models that can greatly facilitate computation. The basic
idea is to replace a sum that appears in the exact log-likelihood by an
expectation over the model covariates; the resulting ""expected log-likelihood""
can in many cases be computed significantly faster than the exact
log-likelihood. In many neuroscience experiments the distribution over model
covariates is controlled by the experimenter and the expected log-likelihood
approximation becomes particularly useful; for example, estimators based on
maximizing this expected log-likelihood (or a penalized version thereof) can
often be obtained with orders of magnitude computational savings compared to
the exact maximum likelihood estimators. A risk analysis establishes that these
maximum EL estimators often come with little cost in accuracy (and in some
cases even improved accuracy) compared to standard maximum likelihood
estimates. Finally, we find that these methods can significantly decrease the
computation time of marginal likelihood calculations for model selection and of
Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for sampling from the posterior parameter
distribution. We illustrate our results by applying these methods to a
computationally-challenging dataset of neural spike trains obtained via
large-scale multi-electrode recordings in the primate retina.

unknown waveform) require identification of weak signals in background detector
noise. The sensitivity of such searches is often critically limited by
non-Gaussian noise fluctuations which are difficult to distinguish from real
signals, posing a key problem for transient gravitational-wave astronomy.
Current noise rejection tests are based on the analysis of a relatively small
number of measured properties of the candidate signal, typically correlations
between detectors. Multivariate analysis (MVA) techniques probe the full space
of measured properties of events in an attempt to maximise the power to
accurately classify events as signal or background. This is done by taking
samples of known background events and (simulated) signal events to train the
MVA classifier, which can then be applied to classify events of unknown type.
We apply the boosted decision tree (BDT) MVA technique to the problem of
detecting gravitational-wave bursts associated with gamma-ray bursts. We find
that BDTs are able to increase the sensitive distance reach of the search by as
much as 50%, corresponding to a factor of ~3 increase in sensitive volume. This
improvement is robust against trigger sky position, large sky localisation
error, poor data quality, and the simulated signal waveforms that are used.
Critically, we find that the BDT analysis is able to detect signals that have
different morphologies to those used in the classifier training and that this
improvement extends to false alarm probabilities beyond the 3{\sigma}
significance level. These findings indicate that MVA techniques may be used for
the robust detection of gravitational-wave bursts with a priori unknown
waveform.

how to determine the Majorana CP-violating phases in the 3 x 3 lepton flavor
mixing matrix U will become a desirable experimental question. The answer to
this question is to explore all the possible lepton-number-violating (LNV)
processes in which the Majorana phases really matter. In this paper we carry
out a systematic study of CP violation in neutrino-antineutrino oscillations,
whose CP-conserving parts involve six independent 0\nu\beta\beta-like mass
terms <m>_{\alpha\beta} and CP-violating parts are associated with nine
independent Jarlskog-like parameters V^{ij}_{\alpha\beta} (for \alpha, \beta =
e, \mu, \tau and i, j = 1, 2,3). With the help of current neutrino oscillation
data, we analyze the sensitivities of |<m>_{\alpha\beta}| and
V^{ij}_{\alpha\beta} to the three CP-violating phases of U, and illustrate the
salient features of six independent CP-violating asymmetries between \nu_\alpha
\to \bar{\nu}_\beta and \bar{\nu}_\alpha \to \nu_\beta oscillations. As a
by-product, the effects of the CP-violating phases on the LNV decays of doubly-

unsuppressed value of \theta_{13}. Such CP-conserving LNV processes can be
complementary to the possible measurements of neutrino-antineutrino

persistently selected online so as to optimize the tracking performance of an

formation via a (possibly time-varying) communication-graph topology. The
effects of a change in the leader identity are theoretically analyzed and
exploited for defining a suitable error metric able to capture the tracking
performance of the multi- agent group. Both the group performance and the
metric design are found to depend upon the spectral properties of a special
directed graph induced by the identity of the chosen leader. By exploiting
these results, as well as distributed estimation techniques, we are then able
to detail a fully-decentralized adaptive strategy able to periodically select
online the best leader among the neighbors of the current leader. Numerical
simulations show that the application of the proposed technique results in an
improvement of the overall performance of the group behavior w.r.t. other

between 1 and 30 days in eight consecutive Kepler quarters, where 30 days is an
estimated maximum for the validity of the PDC_MAP data correction pipeline. We
selected stable rotation periods, i.e., periods that do not vary from the
median by more than one day in at least six of the eight quarters. We averaged
the periods for each stellar spectral class according to B - V color and
compared the results to archival vsini data, using stellar radii estimates from

  Results: We report on the stable starspot rotation periods of 12 151 Kepler

Hamiltonian can be described in terms of a self-induced quantum many-body
metrological protocol. This effect relies on the sensitivity of the ground
state to a small symmetry-breaking perturbation at the quantum phase
transition, that leads to the collapse of the wavefunciton into one of two
possible ground states. The scaling of the final state properties with the
number of atoms and with the intensity of the symmetry breaking field, can be
interpreted in terms of the precession time of an effective quantum
metrological protocol. We show that our ideas can be tested with spin-phonon
interactions in trapped ion setups. Our work points to a classification of
quantum phase transitions in terms of the capability of many-body quantum
systems for parameter estimation.

  Hidden Markov Models",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a generative model, the latent Dirichlet hidden Markov
models (LDHMM), for characterizing a database of sequential behaviors
(sequences). LDHMMs posit that each sequence is generated by an underlying
Markov chain process, which are controlled by the corresponding parameters
(i.e., the initial state vector, transition matrix and the emission matrix).
These sequence-level latent parameters for each sequence are modeled as latent
Dirichlet random variables and parameterized by a set of deterministic
database-level hyper-parameters. Through this way, we expect to model the
sequence in two levels: the database level by deterministic hyper-parameters
and the sequence-level by latent parameters. To learn the deterministic
hyper-parameters and approximate posteriors of parameters in LDHMMs, we propose
an iterative algorithm under the variational EM framework, which consists of E
and M steps. We examine two different schemes, the fully-factorized and
partially-factorized forms, for the framework, based on different assumptions.
We present empirical results of behavior modeling and sequence classification
on three real-world data sets, and compare them to other related models. The
experimental results prove that the proposed LDHMMs produce better
generalization performance in terms of log-likelihood and deliver competitive
results on the sequence classification problem.

cushion, eventually inducing a breaking of axisymmetry and the appearance of
`star drops'. This is strongly reminiscent of the Leidenfrost stars that are
observed for drops floating above a hot substrate. The key advantage of this
work is that we inject the airflow at a constant rate below the drop, thus
eliminating thermal effects and allowing for a better control of the flow rate.
We perform experiments with drops of different viscosities and observe stable
states, oscillations and chimney instabilities. We find that for a given drop
size the instability appears above a critical flow rate, where the latter is
largest for small drops. All these observations are reproduced by numerical
simulations, where we treat the drop using potential flow and the gas as a
viscous lubrication layer. Qualitatively, the onset of instability agrees with
the experimental results, although the typical flow rates are too large by a
factor 10. Our results demonstrate that thermal effects are not important for
the formation of star drops, and strongly suggest a purely hydrodynamic
mechanism for the formation of Leidenfrost stars.

specific self similar properties. However the halo similarity is affected by
the baryonic feedback, the momentum injected by the supernovae re-shape the
dark matter core and transform it to a flat density core, with a scale length
imposed by the baryonic feedback. Additionally the baryon feedback impose also
an equilibrium condition, which when coupled with the imposed baryonic scale
length induce a new type of similarity. The new self similar solution implies
that the acceleration generated by dark matter is scale free, which in turns
implies that the baryonic acceleration at a reference radius is also scale
free. Constant dark matter and baryonic accelerations at a reference radius
have effectively been observed for a large class of different galaxies, which
is in support of this approach. The new self similar properties implies that
the total acceleration at larger distances is scale free, the transition
between the dark matter and baryons dominated regime occurs at a constant
acceleration, and the maximum of the velocity curve which defines the amplitude
of the velocity curve at larger distances is proportional to $M^{\frac{1}{4}}$.
These results demonstrates that in this self similar model, cold dark matter is
consistent with the basics of MOND phenomenology for the galaxies. In agreement
with the observation the coincidence between the self similar model and MOND is
expected to break at the scale of clusters of galaxies. Some numerical
experiments shows that the behavior of the density near the origin is closely
approximated by a Einasto profile.

levitation can be correlated with the electric field profile. By applying an
abrupt phase shift the dust particles are transported between both sheaths
through the plasma bulk and partially reside at an equilibium position close to
the upper sheath edge. Hence, the potential profile in the bulk region is
probed by the dust particles providing indirect information on plasma
properties. The respective motion is understood by an analytical model, showing
both the limitations and possible ways of optimizing this sheath-to-sheath

flooding a node weighted graph (TG), with unweighted edges, the node weights
representing the ground level. The progression of a flooding may also be
modeled on the region adjacency graph (RAG) of a topographic surface. On a RAG
each node represents a catchment basin and edges connect neighboring nodes. The
edges are weighted by the altitude of the pass point between both adjacent
regions. The graph is flooded from sources placed at the marker positions and
each node is assigned to the source by which it has been flooded. The level of
the flood is represented on the nodes on each type of graphs. The same flooding
may thus be modeled on a TG or on a RAG. We characterize all valid floodings on
both types of graphs, as they should verify the laws of hydrostatics. We then
show that each flooding of a node weighted graph also is a flooding of an edge
weighted graph with appropriate edge weights. The highest flooding under a
ceiling function may be interpreted as the shortest distance to the root for
the ultrametric flooding distance in an augmented graph. The ultrametric
distance between two nodes is the minimal altitude of a flooding for which both
nodes are flooded. This remark permits to flood edge or node weighted graphs by
using shortest path algorithms. It appears that the collection of all lakes of
a RAG has the structure of a dendrogram, on which the highest flooding under a
ceiling function may be rapidly found.

of one complex scalar triplet. The collider signature of the doubly-charged

into same-sign dileptons or same-sign $W$ boson pairs. However, certain

the heavier doubly-charged scalar mass eigenstate to decay into a
singly-charged scalar and a $W$ boson of the same sign. Considering a large
number of benchmark points with different orders of magnitude of the $\Delta L

complexity of the solar cell structure. As a consequence, complex corrugated

that the treatment of incoherence can be totally decoupled from the complexity

are considered. The spectrally integrated absorption in these devices is found
to depend strongly on the degree of light coherence and, accordingly, the

our direct method in dealing with complex solar cells structures.

pentagon chains in the high density region and discuss their physical
properties. In this procedure the Hamiltonian is first cast in a positive
semidefinite form using composite operators as a linear combination of creation
operators acting on the sites of finite blocks. In the same step, the
interaction is also transformed to obtain terms which require for their minimum
eigenvalue zero at least one electron on each site. The transformed Hamiltonian
matches the original Hamiltonian through a nonlinear system of equations whose
solutions place the deduced ground states in restricted regions of the
parameter space. In the second step, nonlocal product wave functions in
position space are constructed. They are proven to be unique ground states
which describe non-saturated ferromagnetic and correlated half metallic states.
These solutions emerge when the strength of the Hubbard interaction $U_i$ is
site dependent inside the unit cell. In the deduced phases, the interactions
tune the bare dispersive band structure such to develop an effective upper flat
band. We show that this band flattening effect emerges for a broader class of
chains and is not restricted to pentagon chains. For the characterization of
the deduced solutions, uniqueness proofs, exact ground state expectation values
for long-range hopping amplitudes and correlation functions are also
calculated. The study of physical reasons which lead to the appearance of
ferromagnetism has revealed a new mechanism for the emergence of an ordered
phase, described here in details (because of lack of space see the continuation

compared with Lagrangian stochastic models. Generalizing earlier analysis for
axisymmetric ellipsoidal particles (Parsa et al. 2012), we measure the
orientation statistics and rotation rates of general, triaxial ellipsoidal
tracer particles using Lagrangian tracking in DNS of isotropic turbulence.
Triaxial ellipsoids that are very long in one direction, very thin in another,
and of intermediate size in the third direction exhibit reduced rotation rates
that are similar to those of rods in the ellipsoid's longest direction, while
exhibiting increased rotation rates that are similar to those of axisymmetric
discs in the thinnest direction. DNS results differ significantly from the case
when the particle orientations are assumed to be statistically independent from
the velocity gradient tensor. They are also different from predictions of a
Gaussian process for the velocity gradient tensor, which does not provide
realistic preferred vorticity-strain-rate tensor alignments. DNS results are
also compared with a stochastic model for the velocity gradient tensor based on
the recent fluid deformation approximation (RFDA). Unlike the Gaussian model,
the stochastic model accurately predicts the reduction in rotation rate in the
longest direction of triaxial ellipsoids since this direction aligns with the
flow's vorticity, with its rotation perpendicular to the vorticity being
reduced. For disc-like particles, or in directions perpendicular to the longest
direction in triaxial particles, the model predicts {noticeably} smaller
rotation rates than those observed in DNS, a behavior that can be understood
based on the probability of vorticity orientation with the most contracting
strain-rate eigen-direction in the model.

a bound to the extracted energy, a bound that is met by optimal feedback
engines. It is also known that optimal engines are characterized by time

the one that, run in reverse, prepares the system in the post-measurement state

every 3-element equilateral set can be extended to a 4-element equilateral set.
Our approach is based on the result of Kramer and N\'emeth about inscribing a
simplex into a convex body. To prove the theorem of Petty, we shall also
establish that for every 3 points in the normed plane, forming an equilateral
set of the common distance $p$, there exists a fourth point, which is
equidistant to the given points with the distance not larger than $p$. We will
also improve the example given by Petty and obtain the existence of a smooth
and strictly convex norm in $\mathbb{R}^n$, which contain a maximal 4-element
equilateral set. This shows that the theorem of Petty cannot be generalized to
higher dimensions, even for smooth and strictly convex norms.

we have analyzed the quantum phase transition due to the single-ion anisotropic

#HomsTo(H) is the problem of counting homomorphisms from an input graph G to H.
#WHomsTo(H) is the problem of counting weighted homomorphisms to H, given an

tree, these problems turn out to be sufficiently rich to capture all of the
known approximation behaviour in #P. We give a complete trichotomy for
#WHomsTo(H). If H is a star then #WHomsTo(H) is in FP. If H is not a star but
it does not contain a certain induced subgraph J_3 then #WHomsTo(H) is
equivalent under approximation-preserving (AP) reductions to #BIS, the problem
of counting independent sets in a bipartite graph. This problem is complete for
the class #RHPi_1 under AP-reductions. Finally, if H contains an induced J_3
then #WHomsTo(H) is equivalent under AP-reductions to #SAT, the problem of
counting satisfying assignments to a CNF Boolean formula. Thus, #WHomsTo(H) is
complete for #P under AP-reductions. The results are similar for #HomsTo(H)

there are trees H for which #HomsTo(H) is #SAT-equivalent (disproving a
plausible conjecture of Kelk). There is an interesting connection between these
homomorphism-counting problems and the problem of approximating the partition
function of the ferromagnetic Potts model. In particular, we show that for a
family of graphs J_q, parameterised by a positive integer q, the problem
#HomsTo(H) is AP-interreducible with the problem of approximating the partition
function of the q-state Potts model. It was not previously known that the Potts

obtain some additional upper bounds for the approximation complexity of

host molecular cloud cores are commonly treated as separate problems. However,
interdependencies between the two can be significant. Here, we study the
simultaneous evolution of massive protostars and their host molecular cores
using a multi-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics code that incorporates the
effects of the thermal pressure and radiative acceleration feedback of the
centrally forming protostar. The evolution of the massive protostar is computed
simultaneously using the stellar evolution code STELLAR, modified to include
the effects of variable accretion. The interdependencies are studied in three
different collapse scenarios. For comparison, stellar evolutionary tracks at
constant accretion rates and the evolution of the host cores using pre-computed
stellar evolutionary tracks are computed. The resulting interdependencies of
the protostellar evolution and the evolution of the environment are extremely
diverse and depend on the order of events, in particular the time of
circumstellar accretion disk formation with respect to the onset of the
bloating phase of the star. Feedback mechanisms affect the instantaneous
accretion rate and the protostar's radius, temperature and luminosity on
timescales equal or smaller than 5 kyr, corresponding to the accretion
timescale and Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction timescale, respectively.
Nevertheless, it is possible to approximate the overall protostellar evolution
in many cases by pre-computed stellar evolutionary tracks assuming appropriate
constant average accretion rates.

mass scale of heavy particles which can be reached. In view of this situation,
it appears reasonable to ask whether a perfect conversion machine of this type
(a perfect `collider') exists even in principle and whether there is a highest
mass scale which can be reached by such a machine. It turns out that, with a
number of assumptions, such a machine is conceivable in a world with a
strongly-coupled, approximately scale invariant 4d field theory with 5d gravity
dual. This machine can be realized as a 5d tower built on the IR brane (in
Randall-Sundrum model language). Transporting mass to the tip of this tower is,
under certain conditions, equivalent to producing heavy point-like 4d
particles. Hence, this can be thought of as a perfect `collider'. In the
simple, `pure Randall-Sundrum setting' that we analyse, this machine can only
reach a certain maximal energy scale, which falls as the gravity-dual of the 4d
QFT approaches the strong coupling domain. On these grounds, one might expect
that a no-go theorem (in the spirit of that of Carnot for the conversion of
heat into work) exists for weakly-coupled QFTs. We end with some speculations
about collider efficiencies at weak coupling, involving possibly the concept of
entanglement entropy.

planets in protoplanetary disks, considering the effects of the inclination
relative to the line of sight. The gap's trough is darkened by both shadowing
and cooling, relative to the uninterrupted disk. The gap's outer wall is
brightened by direct illumination and also by heating, which puffs it up so
that it intercepts more starlight. In this paper, we examine the effects of
inclination on resolved images of disks with and without gaps at a wide range
of wavelengths. The scattering surface's offset from the disk midplane creates
a brightness asymmetry along the axis of inclination, making the disk's near
side appear brighter than the far side in scattered light. Finite disk
thickness also causes the projected distances of equidistant points on the disk
surface to be smaller on the near side of the disk as compared to the far side.
Consequently, the gap shoulder on the near side of the disk should appear
brighter and closer to the star than on the far side. However, if the angular
resolution of the observation is coarser than the width of the brightened gap
shoulder, then the gap shoulder on the far side may appear brighter because of
its larger apparent size. We present a formula to recover the scale height and
inclination angle of an imaged disk using simple geometric arguments and
measuring disk asymmetries. Resolved images of circumstellar disks have
revealed clearings and gaps, such as the transitional disk in LkCa 15. Models
created using our synthetic imaging attempting to match the morphology of
observed scattered light images of LkCa 15 indicate that the H-band flux
deficit in the inner $\sim0.5\arcsec$ of the disk can be explained with a
planet of mass greater than 0.5 Jupiter mass.

purpose of this paper is twofold: 1) to advertise the simple classical
mechanism: trading of gauge symmetries, that underlies the bulk-bulk
equivalence of General Relativity and Shape Dynamics to readers interested in
dualities of the type of AdS/CFT; and 2) to highlight that this mechanism can
be used to explain certain results of holographic renormalization, providing an
alternative to the AdS/CFT conjecture for these cases. To make contact with
usual the semiclassical AdS/CFT correspondence, we provide, in addition, a
heuristic argument that makes it plausible why the classical equivalence
between General Relativity and Shape Dynamics turns into a duality between
radial evolution in gravity and the renormalization group flow of a conformal
field theory. We believe that Shape Dynamics provides a new perspective on
gravity by giving conformal structure a primary role within the theory. It is
hoped that this work provides the first steps towards understanding what this
new perspective may be able to teach us about holographic dualities.

by dust extinction and the severe blending of adjacent (spatially or in

requires a linear resolution <40 pc, but analyses satisfying this requirement
have been done only in a handful of galaxies, so far. As the first space-based
work using a galaxy sample, we have selected 12 galaxies from our HST NICMOS
Pa{\alpha} survey and studied the luminosity function and size distribution of
HII regions both in individual galaxies and cumulatively, using a virtually
extinction-free tracer of the ionizing photon rate. The high angular resolution
and low sensitivity to diffuse emission of NICMOS also offer an advantage over
ground-based imaging by enabling a higher degree of de-blending of the HII

studies. Instead, we find that the LFs, both individual and co-added, follow a
single power law dN(L)/dlnL ~ L^-1, consistent with the mass function of star
clusters in nearby galaxies, and in agreement with the results of the existing
analyses with HST data. The individual and co-added size distribution of HII
regions are both roughly consistent with dN(D)/dlnD ~ D^-3, but the power-law
scaling is probably contaminated by blended regions or complexes.

the spin-zero single-trace operator dual to the bulk scalar. We interpret this

about the pure de Sitter vacuum. Restricting to SO(3) preserving deformations,
other local maxima (which exceed the one near the de Sitter vacuum) can peak at
inhomogeneous and anisotropic values of the late time metric and scalar
profile. Numerical experiments suggest the remarkable observation that, upon
fixing a certain average of the bulk scalar profile at I^+, the wavefunction
becomes normalizable in all the other (infinite) directions of the deformation.

in the Potts model since the compu- tational costs depend just on the periodic
part of the lattice and not on the whole. However, even when the cost is
reduced, the transfer-matrix technique is still an NP-hard problem since the
time T(|V|, |E|) needed to compute the matrix grows ex- ponentially as a
function of the graph width. In this work, we present a parallel
transfer-matrix implementation that scales performance under multi-core
architectures. The construction of the matrix is based on several repetitions
of the deletion- contraction technique, allowing parallelism suitable to
multi-core machines. Our experimental results show that the multi-core
implementation achieves speedups of 3.7X with p = 4 processors and 5.7X with p
= 8. The efficiency of the implementation lies between 60% and 95%, achieving
the best balance of speedup and efficiency at p = 4 processors for actual
multi-core architectures. The algorithm also takes advantage of the lattice
symmetry, making the transfer matrix computation to run up to 2X faster than
its non-symmetric counterpart and use up to a quarter of the original space.

for generating $N$-point configurations on $A$ that have asymptotic
distribution $\sigma (x)$ as $N\to \infty$; moreover such configurations are
""quasi-uniform"" in the sense that the ratio of the covering radius to the
separation distance is bounded independent of $N$. The method is based upon
minimizing the energy of $N$ particles constrained to $A$ interacting via a
weighted power law potential $w(x,y)|x-y|^{-s}$, where $s>d$ is a fixed

properties keeping in the energy sums only those pairs of points that are
located at a distance of at most $r_N=C_N N^{-1/d}$ from each other, with $C_N$
being a positive sequence tending to infinity arbitrarily slowly. To do this we
minimize the energy with respect to a varying truncated weight

rotational emission lines in infrared (IR) galaxies based on the Fourier
Transform Spectrometer (FTS) data of {\it Herschel} SPIRE. Among the 176

line detected. The H$_2$O line luminosities range from $\sim 1 \times 10^5$
$L_{\odot}$ to $\sim 5 \times 10^7 L_{\odot}$ while the total IR luminosities
($L_\mathrm{IR}$) have a similar spread ($\sim 1-300 \times 10^{10}
L_{\odot}$). In addition, emission lines of H$_2$O$^+$ and H$_2^{18}$O are also
detected. H$_2$O is found, for most galaxies, to be the strongest molecular
emitter after CO in FTS spectra. The luminosity of the five most important
H$_2$O lines is near-linearly correlated with $L_\mathrm{IR}$, no matter
whether strong active galactic nucleus signature is present or not. However,
the luminosity of H$_2$O($2_{11}-2_{02}$) and H$_2$O($2_{20}-2_{11}$) appears
to increase slightly faster than linear with $L_\mathrm{IR}$. Although the
slope turns out to be slightly steeper when $z\sim 2-4$ ULIRGs are included,
the correlation is still closely linear. We find that
$L_\mathrm{H_2O}/L_\mathrm{IR}$ decreases with increasing $f_{25}/f_{60}$, but
see no dependence on $f_{60}/f_{100}$, possibly indicating that very warm dust
contributes little to the excitation of the submillimeter H$_2$O lines. The
average spectral line energy distribution (SLED) of the entire sample is
consistent with individual SLEDs and the IR pumping plus collisional excitation
model, showing that the strongest lines are H$_2$O($2_{02}-1_{11}$) and
H$_2$O($3_{21}-3_{12}$).

provides a key test for models of galactic dynamics. In terms of modified laws
of gravity and/or inertia, the MDA relation quantifies the transition from
Newtonian to modified dynamics at low centripetal accelerations a_c < 10^-10
m/s^2. As yet, neither dynamical models based on dark matter nor proposed
modifications of the laws of gravity/inertia have predicted the functional form
of the MDA relation. In this work, I revisit the MDA data and compare them to
four different theoretical scaling laws. Three of these scaling laws are
entirely empirical, the fourth one - the ""simple mu"" function of Modified
Newtonian Dynamics - derives from a toy model of gravity based on massive
gravitons (the ""graviton picture""). All theoretical MDA relations comprise one
free parameter of the dimension of an acceleration, Milgrom's constant a_M. I
find that the ""simple mu"" function provides a good fit to the data free of
notable systematic residuals and provides the best fit among the four scaling
laws tested. The best-fit value of Milgrom's constant is a_M = (1.06 +/-
0.05)*10^-10 m/s^2. Given the successful prediction of the functional form of
the MDA relation, plus an overall agreement with the observed kinematics of
stellar systems spanning eight orders of magnitude in size and 14 orders of
magnitude in mass, I conclude that the ""graviton picture"" is sufficient (albeit
probably not a necessary or unique approach) to describe galactic dynamics on
all scales well beyond the scale of the solar system. This suggests that, at
least on galactic scales, gravity behaves as if it was mediated by massive
particles.

presence of both a surface-parallel electrostatic potential bias between the
two dangling bonds and a tunable midinfrared laser capable of inducing Rabi
oscillations in the system. With a nonresonant laser, the time-averaged charge
distribution in the dangling-bond pair is asymmetric as imposed by the bias.

modeling the subsonic dynamic processes in the solar convective envelope. A
comparison of this code with the widely used global spectral anlastic MHD code,
ASH (Anelastic Spherical Harmonics), shows that FSAM produces convective flows
with statistical properties and mean flows similar to the ASH results. Using
FSAM, we first simulate the rotating solar convection in a partial spherical
shell domain and obtain a statistically steady, giant-cell convective flow with
a solar-like differential rotation. We then insert buoyant toroidal flux tubes
near the bottom of the convecting envelope and simulate the rise of the flux
tubes in the presence of the giant cell convection. We find that for buoyant
flux tubes with an initial field strength of 100 kG, the magnetic buoyancy
largely determines the rise of the tubes although strong down flows produce
significant undulation and distortion to the shape of the emerging
$\Omega$-shaped loops. The convective flows significantly reduce the rise time
it takes for the apex of the flux tube to reach the top. For the weakly twisted
and untwisted cases we simulated, the apex portion is found to rise nearly
radially to the top in about a month, and produce an emerging region (at a
depth of about 30 Mm below the photosphere) with an overall tilt angle
consistent with the active region tilts, although the emergence pattern is more
complex compared to the case without convection. Near the top boundary at a
depth of about 30 Mm, the emerging flux shows a retrograde zonal flow of about
345 m/s relative to the mean flow at that latitude.

for the nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equation (NLS) with wave operator (NLSW), and
carry out rigorous error analysis. The NLSW is NLS perturbed by the wave
operator with strength described by a dimensionless parameter
$\varepsilon\in(0,1]$. As $\varepsilon\to0^+$, the NLSW converges to the NLS
and for the small perturbation, i.e. $0<\varepsilon\ll1$, the solution of the
NLSW differs from that of the NLS with a function oscillating in time with
$O(\varepsilon^2)$-wavelength at $O(\varepsilon^2)$ and $O(\varepsilon^4)$
amplitudes for ill-prepared and well-prepared initial data, respectively. This
rapid oscillation in time brings significant difficulties in designing and
analyzing numerical methods with error bounds uniformly in $\varepsilon$. In
this work, we show that the proposed EWI-SP possesses the optimal uniform error
bounds at $O(\tau^2)$ and $O(\tau)$ in $\tau$ (time step) for well-prepared
initial data and ill-prepared initial data, respectively, and spectral accuracy
in $h$ (mesh size) for the both cases, in the $L^2$ and semi-$H^1$ norms. This
result significantly improves the error bounds of the finite difference methods
for the NLSW. Our approach involves a careful study of the error propagation,
cut-off of the nonlinearity and the energy method. Numerical examples are
provided to confirm our theoretical analysis.

high-resolution (FWHM=2"", or ~0.035 pc) dust extinction mapping in near- and
mid-infrared, and dust emission mapping with the Herschel satellite. These two
completely independent techniques yield a strikingly good agreement,
highlighting their complementarity and robustness. We first analyze the dense
gas mass fraction and linear mass density of G11. We show that G11 has a top
heavy mass distribution and has a linear mass density (M_l ~ 600 Msun pc^{-1})
that greatly exceeds the critical value of a self-gravitating, non-turbulent
cylinder. These properties make G11 analogous to the Orion A cloud, despite its
low star-forming activity. This suggests that the amount of dense gas in
molecular clouds is more closely connected to environmental parameters or
global processes than to the star-forming efficiency of the cloud. We then
examine hierarchical fragmentation in G11 over a wide range of size-scales and
densities. We show that at scales 0.5 pc > l > 8 pc, the fragmentation of G11
is in agreement with that of a self-gravitating cylinder. At scales smaller
than l < 0.5 pc, the results agree better with spherical Jeans' fragmentation.
One possible explanation for the change in fragmentation characteristics is the
size-scale-dependent collapse time-scale that results from the finite size of
real molecular clouds: at scales l < 0.5 pc, fragmentation becomes sufficiently
rapid to be unaffected by global instabilities.

structure functions, and provides an algebraically consistent way of
discretizing the Dirac first-class constraint algebra for general relativity.
This paper successfully formulates the Wheeler-DeWitt scheme of quantization of
the canonical tensor model; the ordering of operators in the constraints is
determined without ambiguity by imposing Hermiticity and covariance on the
constraints, and the commutation algebra of constraints takes essentially the
same from as the classical Poisson algebra, i.e. is first-class. Thus one could
consistently obtain, at least locally in the configuration space, wave
functions of ""universe"" by solving the partial differential equations
representing the constraints, i.e. the Wheeler-DeWitt equations for the quantum
canonical tensor model. The unique wave function for the simplest non-trivial
case is exactly and globally obtained. Although this case is far from being
realistic, the wave function has a few physically interesting features; it
shows that locality is favored, and that there exists a locus of configurations

secondary users has spatial, temporal, and spectral features. With the requests
of secondary users and the reserve price of the primary user, our goal is to
design truthful mechanisms that will either maximize the social efficiency or
maximize the revenue of the primary user. As the optimal conflict-free spectrum
allocation problem is NP-hard, in this work, we design near optimal spectrum
allocation mechanisms separately based on the following techniques:
derandomized allocation from integer programming formulation, its linear
programming (LP) relaxation, and the dual of the LP. We theoretically prove
that 1) our near optimal allocation methods are bid monotone, which implys
truthful auction mechanisms; and 2) our near optimal allocation methods can
achieve a social efficiency or a revenue that is at least $1-\frac{1}{e}$ times
of the optimal respectively. At last, we conduct extensive simulations to study
the performances (social efficiency, revenue) of the proposed methods, and the
simulation results corroborate our theoretical analysis.

with input and state constraints during transient operations. However,
industrial PID controllers directly manipulates the actuators, so they play the
key role in small perturbation robustness. This paper considers the problem of
augmenting the commonplace PID with the constraint handling and optimization
functionalities of MPC. First, we review the MPC framework, which employs a
linear feedback gain in its unconstrained region. This linear gain can be any
preexisting multiloop PID design, or based on the two stabilizing PI or PID
designs for multivariable systems proposed in the paper. The resulting
controller is a feedforward PID mapping, a straightforward form without the
need of tuning PID to fit an optimal input. The parametrized solution of MPC
under constraints further leverages a familiar PID gain scheduling structure.
Steady state robustness is achieved along with the PID design so that
additional robustness analysis is avoided.

limits, it is equivalent to locally uniform convergence, whereas under mild
side conditions, it implies $L^p$ convergence. For the examples mentioned

material current-voltage characteristics, linear for normal metals, and
nonlinear for superconductors, plus a careful account of the boundary
conditions. For Ohmic films, we consider the response to a delta function
source-field turned on instantly. As one of few problems in nonlocal
electrodynamics, this has an analytical solution, which we obtain, in both
Fourier and real space. Next, the dynamical behaviour of a square
superconductor film during ramping up of the field, and subsequently returning
to zero, is treated numerically. Then, this remanent state is used as initial
condition for triggering thermomagnetic avalanches. The avalanches tend to
invade the central part where the density of trapped flux is largest, forming
dendritic patterns in excellent agreement with magneto-optical images. Detailed
profiles of current and flux density are presented and discussed. Finally, the
formalism is extended to multiply connected samples, and numerical results for
a patterned superconducting film, a ring with a square lattice of antidots, are

in the 480 to 1902 GHz range with the HIFI spectrometer onboard Herschel and
carried out the reduction, line identification, and a broad analysis of the
line profile components, excitation, and cooling. We detect 719 spectral lines
from 40 species and isotopologs. The line flux is dominated by CO, H2O, and
CH3OH. The line profiles are complex and vary with species and upper level
energy, but clearly contain signatures from quiescent gas, a broad component
likely due to an outflow, and a foreground cloud. We find abundant evidence for
warm, dense gas, as well as for an outflow in the field of view. Line flux
represents 2% of the 7 L_Sol luminosity detected with HIFI in the 480 to 1250
GHz range. Of the total line flux, 60% is from CO, 13% from H2O and 9% from
CH3OH. A comparison with similar HIFI spectra of other sources is set to
provide much new insight into star formation regions, a case in point being a
difference of two orders of magnitude in the relative contribution of sulphur
oxides to the line cooling of Orion KL and OMC-2 FIR 4.

provide a simple analytical criterion. Second, a design for a nanoantenna is
presented that enables the strong coupling regime. Besides a vivid time

probability proportional to the existing nodes' degree --- has become the
standard growth model for scale-free networks, where the asymptotic probability
of a node having degree $k$ is proportional to $k^{-\gamma}$. However, the
motivation for this model is entirely ad hoc. We use exact likelihood arguments
and show that the optimal way to build a scale-free network is to attach most
new links to nodes of low degree. Curiously, this leads to a scale-free
networks with a single dominant hub: a star-like structure we call a super-star
network. Asymptotically, the optimal strategy is to attach each new node to one
of the nodes of degree $k$ with probability proportional to
$\frac{1}{N+\zeta(\gamma)(k+1)^\gamma}$ (in a $N$ node network) --- a stronger
bias toward high degree nodes than exhibited by standard preferential
attachment. Our algorithm generates optimally scale-free networks (the
super-star networks) as well as randomly sampling the space of all scale-free
networks with a given degree exponent $\gamma$. We generate viable realisation
with finite $N$ for $1\ll \gamma<2$ as well as $\gamma>2$. We observe an
apparently discontinuous transition at $\gamma\approx 2$ between so-called
super-star networks and more tree-like realisations. Gradually increasing
$\gamma$ further leads to re-emergence of a super-star hub. To quantify these
structural features we derive a new analytic expression for the expected degree
exponent of a pure preferential attachment process, and introduce alternative
measures of network entropy. Our approach is generic and may also be applied to
an arbitrary degree distribution.

fruitful, the nonregular conditions require a substantial different treatment
based on local extreme values. We study this model under the realistic setting
in which both the smoothness degree $\beta>0$ and the sharpness degree
$\mathfrak {a}\in(0,\infty)$ are unknown in advance. We construct adaptation
procedures applying a nested version of Lepski's method and the negative Hill
estimator which show no loss in the convergence rates with respect to the
general $L_q$-risk and a logarithmic loss with respect to the pointwise risk.
Optimality of these rates is proved for $\mathfrak{a}\in(0,\infty)$. Some
numerical simulations and an application to real data are provided.

efficiency of the solar cells. Here, we use light-induced EPR spectroscopy
combined with DFT calculations to study the electronic structure of charge

composites, two paramagnetic species are formed due to photo-induced electron
transfer between the conjugated polymer and the fullerene. They are the
positive, P+, and negative, P-, polarons on the polymer backbone and fullerene
cage, respectively, and correspond to radical cations and radical anions. Using
the high spectral resolution of high-frequency EPR (130 GHz), the EPR spectra

believed to be dominated by contribution from thermal radiation of quark gluon
plasma up to $p_T$ $\sim 5$ GeV/$c$, although other sources start outshining
the thermal contribution at already smaller values of $p_T$ in the direct
photon spectrum. The elliptic flow of thermal photons from ideal hydrodynamics
considering a smooth initial density distribution under-predicts the PHENIX
direct photon data from 200A GeV Au+Au collisions at RHIC by a large margin in
the range $1 < p_T < 5$ GeV/$c$. However, a significant enhancement of thermal
photon production due to fluctuations in the initial QCD matter density
distributions is expected. We show that such fluctuations result in
substantially larger photon elliptic flow for $p_T > 2.5 $ GeV/$c$ compared to
a smooth initial-state-averaged density profile. The results from
event-by-event hydrodynamics are found to be sensitive to the fluctuation size
parameter. However, the effects of initial state fluctuations are insufficient
to account for the discrepancy to the PHENIX data for direct photon elliptic
flow. Furthermore, the photon $v_2$ is reduced even more when we include the
NLO pQCD prompt photon component. We also calculate the spectra and elliptic
flow of thermal photons for 2.76A TeV Pb+Pb collisions at LHC and for the
0--40% centrality bin. Thermal photons from event-by-event hydrodynamics along
with prompt photons from NLO pQCD calculations explain the ALICE preliminary
direct photon data well in the region $p_T \ge 2.5$ GeV/c. Similar to RHIC, the
elliptic flow results at LHC are again found to be much smaller than the ALICE
preliminary $v_2$ data.

explain the late time acceleration of the Universe without introducing any

distinguishing such model with the concordance \Lambda CDM model using present

using the observations related to the growth of matter over density g(z) as
measured by different galaxy surveys. As background cosmology is not sufficient
to distinguish different dark energy models, we first find out the functional
form for f(R) (which is non-minimally coupled to the matter lagrangian) that
produces the similar background cosmology as in \Lambda CDM. Subsequently we
calculate the growth for the matter over density g(z) for such non minimally

the measurements of g(z)\sigma_{8}(z) by different galaxy surveys to
reconstruct the behavior for g(z) and \sigma_{8}(z) for both the non-minimally
coupled f(R) gravity models as well as for the \Lambda CDM. Our results show
that there is a small but finite window where one can distinguish the

theories of young stellar feedback on their surroundings. The focus of many
outflow studies is the correlation between the outflow force, bolometric
luminosity and envelope mass. However, it is difficult to combine the results
of different studies in large evolutionary plots over many orders of magnitude
due to the range of data quality, analysis methods and corrections for
observational effects such as opacity and inclination. We aim to determine the
outflow force for a sample of low luminosity embedded sources. We will quantify
the influence of the analysis method and the assumptions entering the
calculation of the outflow force. We use the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope to
map 12CO J=3-2 over 2'x2' regions around 16 Class I sources of a well-defined
sample in Ophiuchus at 15"" resolution. The outflow force is then calculated
using seven different methods differing e.g. in the use of intensity-weighted
emission and correction factors for inclination. The results from the analysis
methods differ from each other by up to a factor of 6, whereas observational
properties and choices in the analysis procedure affect the outflow force by up
to a factor of 4. For the sample of Class I objects, bipolar outflows are
detected around 13 sources including 5 new detections, where the three
non-detections are confused by nearby outflows from other sources. When
combining outflow forces from different studies, a scatter by up to a factor of
5 can be expected. Although the true outflow force remains unknown, the
separation method (separate calculation of dynamical time and momentum) is
least affected by the uncertain observational parameters. The correlations
between outflow force, bolometric luminosity and envelope mass are further
confirmed down to low luminosity sources.

Its principle is to produce a destructive interference along the line-of-sight
so that the stellar flux is rejected, while the flux of the off-axis source can
be transmitted. In practice, various instrumental perturbations can degrade the
nulling performance. Any imperfection in phase, amplitude, or polarization
produces a spurious flux that leaks to the interferometer output and corrupts
the transmitted off-axis flux. One of these instrumental pertubations is the
crosstalk phenomenon, which occurs because of multiple parasitic reflections
inside transmitting optics, and/or diffraction effects related to beam
propagation along finite size optics. It can include a crosstalk of a beam with
itself, and a mutual crosstalk between different beams. This can create a
parasitic interference pattern, which degrades the intrinsic transmission map -
or intensity response - of the interferometer. In this context, we describe how
this instrumental effect impairs the performance of a Bracewell interferometer.
A simple formalism is developed to derive the corresponding modified intensity
response of the interferometer, as a function of the two parameters of
interest: the crosstalk level (or contamination rate) and the phase shift
between the primary and secondary - parasitic - beams. We then apply our
mathematical approach to a few scientific cases, both analytically and using
the GENIEsim simulation software, adapted to handle coherent crosstalk. Our
results show that a coherent crosstalk level of about 1% implies a 20% drop of
the SNR at most. Careful attention should thus be paid to reduce the crosstalk
level inside an interferometric instrument and ensure an instrumental stability
that provides the necessary sensitivity through calibration procedures.

mass diagram contains a Majorana mass insertion there are two possibilities,
both of which are known. If the mass insertion is of the Dirac type there are
seven additional models, two of which are excluded by direct-detection

dark-matter is viable. There are cases with an inert singlet, an inert doublet,
and an inert triplet, providing a natural setting for inert N-tuplet models of
dark matter, with the additional feature of achieving radiative neutrino mass.

model in terms of the Ginsparg-Wilson relation. This formulation has an exact
supersymmetry on the lattice. The lattice action is invariant under a deformed
supersymmetric transformation which is non-linear in the scalar fields and it
is determined by an iterative procedure in the coupling constant to all orders
in perturbation theory. We also show that the corresponding Ward-Takahashi
identity is satisfied at fixed lattice spacing. The calculation is performed in
lattice perturbation theory up to order $g^3$ (two-loop) and the Ward-Takahashi
identity (containing 110 connected non-tadpole Feynman diagrams) is satisfied
at fixed lattice spacing thanks to this exact lattice supersymmetry.

  Tsigas","Configurable Strategies for Work-stealing",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Work-stealing systems are typically oblivious to the nature of the tasks they
are scheduling. For instance, they do not know or take into account how long a
task will take to execute or how many subtasks it will spawn. Moreover, the
actual task execution order is typically determined by the underlying task
storage data structure, and cannot be changed. There are thus possibilities for
optimizing task parallel executions by providing information on specific tasks
and their preferred execution order to the scheduling system.
  We introduce scheduling strategies to enable applications to dynamically
provide hints to the task-scheduling system on the nature of specific tasks.
Scheduling strategies can be used to independently control both local task
execution order as well as steal order. In contrast to conventional scheduling
policies that are normally global in scope, strategies allow the scheduler to
apply optimizations on individual tasks. This flexibility greatly improves
composability as it allows the scheduler to apply different, specific
scheduling choices for different parts of applications simultaneously. We
present a number of benchmarks that highlight diverse, beneficial effects that
can be achieved with scheduling strategies. Some benchmarks (branch-and-bound,
single-source shortest path) show that prioritization of tasks can reduce the
total amount of work compared to standard work-stealing execution order. For
other benchmarks (triangle strip generation) qualitatively better results can
be achieved in shorter time. Other optimizations, such as dynamic merging of
tasks or stealing of half the work, instead of half the tasks, are also shown
to improve performance. Composability is demonstrated by examples that combine
different strategies, both within the same kernel (prefix sum) as well as when
scheduling multiple kernels (prefix sum and unbalanced tree search).

the mechanisms by which recombination is initiated in mammals. However,
uniquely amongst mammals, canids appear to lack a functional version of PRDM9
and may therefore provide a model for understanding recombination that occurs
in the absence of PRDM9, and thus how PRDM9 functions to shape the
recombination landscape. We have constructed a fine-scale genetic map from
patterns of linkage disequilibrium assessed using high-throughput sequence data
from 51 free-ranging dogs, Canis lupus familiaris. While broad-scale properties
of recombination appear similar to other mammalian species, our fine-scale
estimates indicate that canine highly elevated recombination rates are observed
in the vicinity of CpG rich regions including gene promoter regions, but show
little association with H3K4 trimethylation marks identified in spermatocytes.
By comparison to genomic data from the Andean fox, Lycalopex culpaeus, we show
that biased gene conversion is a plausible mechanism by which the high CpG

inherited types, but (neutral) mutations may happen at the birth events. The
smallest subtree containing the genealogy of all the extant individuals at a
fixed time \tau, is called the coalescent point process. We enrich this process
with the history of the mutations that appeared over time, and call it the
marked coalescent point process. With the help of limit theorems for L\'evy
processes with marked jumps established in a previous work (arXiv:1305.6245),
we prove the convergence of the marked coalescent point process with large
population size and two possible regimes for the mutations - one of them being
a classical rare mutation regime, towards a multivariate Poisson point process.
This Poisson point process can be described as the coalescent point process of
the limiting population at \tau, with mutations arising as inhomogeneous
regenerative sets along the lineages. Its intensity measure is further
characterized thanks to the excursion theory for spectrally positive L\'evy
processes. In the rare mutations asymptotic, mutations arise as the image of a
Poisson process by the ladder height process of a L\'evy process with infinite
variation, and in the particular case of the critical branching process with
exponential lifetimes, the limiting object is the Poisson point process of the
depths of excursions of the Brownian motion, with Poissonian mutations on the
lineages.

planets. We have interpreted the observed eclipse-time variations in terms of
the light-travel time effect caused by two planets, exhaustively covering the
multi-dimensional parameter space by fits in the two binary and ten orbital
parameters. We supplemented the fits by stability calculations for all models
with an acceptable chi-square. An island of secularly stable 2:1 resonant
solutions exists, which coincides with the global chi-square minimum. Our
best-fit stable solution yields current orbital periods P_o = 15.47 yr and P_i
= 7.65 yr and eccentricities e_o = 0.14 and e_i = 0.22 for the outer (o) and
inner (i) planets, respectively. The companions qualify as giant planets, with
masses of 7.0 M_Jup and 1.7 M_Jup for the case of orbits coplanar with that of
the binary. The two-planet model that starts from the present system parameters
has a lifetime greater than 10^8 yr, which significantly exceeds the age of NN
Ser of 10^6 yr as a PCEB. The resonance is characterized by libration of the
resonant variable Theta_1 and circulation of omega_i-omega_o, the difference
between the arguments of periapse of the two planets. No stable non-resonant
solutions were found, and the possibility of a 5:2 resonance suggested
previously by us is now excluded at the 99.3% confidence level.

14 Seyfert 1 galaxies having good-quality high-cadence photometric data,
accretion disk scales and BLR sizes are simultaneously determined, on a

across the continuum emitting region are a general phenomenon securely detected
in most cases, b) it is possible to obtain reliable time-delays between
continuum emission in different wavebands, which are not biased by the
contribution of broad emission lines to the signal, and that c) such lags are
consistent with the predictions of standard irradiated accretion disk models,
given the optical luminosity of the sources. These findings provide new and
independent support for standard accretion disks being responsible for the bulk
of the (rest) optical emission in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN).
We interpret our lag measurements in individual objects within the framework of
this model and estimate the typical mass accretion rate to be <~0.1Msol/yr,
with little dependence on the black hole mass. Assuming bolometric corrections
typical of type-I sources, we find tentative evidence for the radiative
efficiency of accretion flows being a rising function of the black hole mass.
With upcoming surveys that will regularly monitor the sky, we may be able to
better quantify possible departures from standard self-similar models, and
identify other modes of accretion in AGN.

shell of the supernova remnant SNR G78.2+2.1, using 21.4 hours of data taken by
the VERITAS gamma-ray observatory in 2009. These data confirm the preliminary
indications of gamma-ray emission previously seen in a two-year (2007-2009)
blind survey of the Cygnus region by VERITAS. VER J2019+407, which is detected
at a post-trials significance of 7.5 standard deviations in the 2009 data, is
localized to the northwestern rim of the remnant in a region of enhanced radio

(stat)+0.04^{\circ}_{-0.02}^{\circ}(sys) and its spectrum is well-characterized
by a differential power law (dN/dE = N_0 \times (E/TeV)^{-\Gamma}) with a
photon index of {\Gamma} = 2.37 \pm 0.14 (stat) \pm 0.20 (sys) and a flux
normalization of N0 = 1.5 \pm 0.2 (stat) \pm 0.4(sys) \times 10^-12 ph TeV^{-1}

emission with the GeV gamma-ray emission seen from SNR G78.2+2.1 as well as
that seen from a nearby cocoon of freshly accelerated cosmic rays. Multiple
scenarios are considered as possible origins for the TeV gamma-ray emission,

core DR21(OH) at 880 mum using the Submillimeter Array (SMA). The dense core
exhibits an overall velocity gradient in a Keplerian-like pattern, which breaks
at the center of the core where SMA 6 and SMA 7 are located. The dust
polarization shows a complex magnetic field, compatible with a toroidal
configuration. This is in contrast with the large, parsec-scale filament that
surrounds the core, where there is a smooth magnetic field. The total magnetic
field strengths in the filament and in the core are 0.9 and 2.1 mG,
respectively. We found evidence of magnetic field diffusion at the core scales,
far beyond the expected value for ambipolar diffusion. It is possible that the
diffusion arises from fast magnetic reconnection in the presence of turbulence.
The dynamics of the DR 21(OH) core appear to be controlled energetically in
equal parts by the magnetic field, magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence and
the angular momentum. The effect of the angular momentum (this is a fast
rotating core) is probably causing the observed toroidal field configuration.
Yet, gravitation overwhelms all the forces, making this a clear supercritical
core with a mass-to-flux ratio of ~6 times the critical value. However,
simulations show that this is not enough for the high level of fragmentation
observed at 1000 AU scales. Thus, rotation and outflow feedback is probably the
main cause of the observed fragmentation.

pioneering works of the last century, we formulate an approximate, integrable

chaotic motion as a result of overlap among neighboring first-order mean-motion

systems close to the critical (cusp overflowing) configuration. The runaway
effect depends on the radial profile l(R) of the angular momentum distribution
of the fluid, on the dimension-less spin a of the central black hole, and other
factors, such as self-gravity. Previously it was demonstrated that, for the
power-law dependence of the radial angular momentum profile, non-magnetized
tori always become runaway stable for a sufficiently high positive value of q.
Here we discuss the role of runaway instability within a framework of an
axially symmetric model of perfect fluid endowed with a purely toroidal
magnetic field. The gradual accretion of material over the cusp transfers the
mass and angular momentum into the black hole, thereby changing the intrinsic
parameters of the Kerr metric. We studied the effect of the ratio of gas to
magnetic pressure and other parameters of the model on the evolution of
critical configurations that are just on the verge of cusp overflow. We show
that the toroidal magnetic component inside an accretion torus does not change
the frequency of its oscillations significantly. We identify these oscillations
as the radial epicyclic mode. These weak effects can trigger the runaway
instability even in situations when the purely hydrodynamical regime of the
torus is stable. On the other hand, in most cases the stable configuration
remains unaffected, and the initial deviations gradually decay after several
orbital periods. We show examples of the torus evolution depending on the
initial magnetization beta, the slope q, and the spin a. The toroidal magnetic
field plays a more important role in the early phases of the accretion process
until the perturbed configuration finds a new equilibrium or disappears because
of the runaway instability.

  The low energy suppression appears when cosmic rays from the closest sources
take a time comparable to the age of the Universe to reach the Earth. This

finding that diffusion has a significant effect on the resulting spectrum, the

theory are scheme-dependent, one can, at least for sufficiently small coupling,
carry out a scheme transformation that removes these terms. A basic question
concerns the extent to which this can be done at an infrared fixed point of an
asymptotically free gauge theory. This is important for quantitative analyses
of the scheme dependence of such a fixed point. Here we study a scheme
transformation $S_{R,m}$ with $m \ge 2$ that is constructed so as to remove the
terms in the beta function at loop order $\ell=3$ to $\ell=m+1$, inclusive.
Starting from an arbitrary initial scheme, we present general expressions for
the coefficients of terms of loop order $\ell$ in the beta function in the
transformed scheme from $\ell=m+2$ up to $\ell=8$. Extending a previous study
of $S_{R,2}$, we investigate the range of applicability of the $S_{R,3}$ scheme
transformation in an asymptotically free SU($N_c$) gauge theory with an
infrared zero in $\beta$ depending on the number, $N_f$, of fermions in the

self-consistently in a restricted range of $N_f$ with a correspondingly small
value of infrared fixed-point coupling. We also study the effect of higher-loop

natural estimate for $\Sigma$ is the plug-in estimator $\hat{\Sigma}$ with
Kendall's tau statistic. We first obtain a sharp bound on the operator norm of
$\hat{\Sigma}-\Sigma$. Then we study a factor model of $\Sigma$, for which we
propose a refined estimator $\widetilde{\Sigma}$ by fitting a low-rank matrix
plus a diagonal matrix to $\hat{\Sigma}$ using least squares with a nuclear
norm penalty on the low-rank matrix. The bound on the operator norm of
$\hat{\Sigma}-\Sigma$ serves to scale the penalty term, and we obtain finite
sample oracle inequalities for $\widetilde{\Sigma}$. We also consider an
elementary factor copula model of $\Sigma$, for which we propose closed-form
estimators. All of our estimation procedures are entirely data-driven.

Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a two-leg ladder find that it has the same form
as the Gibbs density matrix of a gapless spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnetic
chain at a finite temperature determined by the spin gap of the ladder. We
investigate this interesting result by considering a model of free fermions on
a two-leg ladder (gapped by the inter-chain tunneling operator) and in spin
systems on a ladder with a gapped ground state using exact solutions and
several controlled approximations. We calculate the reduced density matrix and
the entanglement entropy for a leg of the ladder (i.e. cut made between the
chains). In the fermionic system we find the exact form of the reduced density
matrix for one of the chains and determine the entanglement spectrum
explicitly. Here we find that in the weak tunneling limit of the ladder the
entanglement entropy of one chain of the gapped ladder has a simple and
universal form dictated by conformal invariance. In the case of the spin
system, we consider the strong coupling limit by using perturbation theory and
get the reduced density matrix by the Schmidt decomposition. The entanglement
entropies of a general gapped system of two coupled conformal field theories
(in 1+1 dimensions) is discussed using the replica trick and scaling arguments.
We show that 1) for a system with a bulk gap the reduced density matrix has the
form of a thermal density matrix, 2) the long-wavelength modes of one subsystem
(a chain) of a gapped coupled system are always thermal, 3) the von Neumann
entropy equals to the thermodynamic entropy of one chain, and 4) the bulk gap
plays the role of effective temperature.

by diblock copolymer melts with a dominant phase. The model is simple enough to
be amenable not only to numerics but also to analysis, yet sophisticated enough
to reproduce hexagonally packed structures that resemble the cylinder patterns
observed in block copolymer experiments.
  Starting from a sharp-interface continuum model, a nonlocal energy functional
involving a Wasserstein cost, we derive the new model using Gamma-convergence
in a limit where the volume fraction of one phase tends to zero. The limit
energy is defined on atomic measures; in three dimensions the atoms represent
small spherical blobs of the minority phase, in two dimensions they represent
thin cylinders of the minority phase.
  We then study minimisers of the limit energy. Numerical minimisation is
performed in two dimensions by recasting the problem as a computational
geometry problem involving power diagrams. The numerical results suggest that
the small particles of the minority phase tend to arrange themselves on a
triangular lattice as the number of particles goes to infinity. This is proved
in the companion paper Bourne, Peletier & Theil and agrees with patterns
observed in block copolymer experiments. This is a rare example of a nonlocal
energy-driven pattern formation problem in two dimensions where it can be
proved that the optimal pattern is periodic.

matter. The equilibrium equations for a spherically symmetric configuration
(mass continuity and Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff) are derived, and their
solutions are obtained numerically for different equations of state of neutron
and quark matter. More specifically, stellar models, described by the stiff
fluid, radiation-like, polytropic and the bag model quark equations of state
are explicitly constructed in both general relativity and EiBI gravity, thus
allowing a comparison between the predictions of these two gravitational
models. As a general result it turns out that for all the considered equations
of state, EiBI gravity stars are more massive than their general relativistic
counterparts. Furthermore, an exact solution of the spherically symmetric field
equations in EiBI gravity, describing an ""exotic"" star, with decreasing
pressure but increasing energy density, is also obtained. As a possible

hybrid microgel consisting of negatively charged anionic microgels possessing
thick sheath of water molecules solvating its protruding anionic moieties and
nanoparticle captivated with in it. Thermodynamic feasibility of synthesis of
particular nanoparticle with in the microgel is dependent upon the magnitude of
interaction between nanoparticle, water molecules and microgel relative to sum
of magnitude of self-interaction between counterions and interaction between
counterions and microgel. Nanoparticles synthesized with in the microgels have
thick electronic cloud that oscillates under the influence of net interaction
potential of charged anionic moieties and solvent water molecules. Hamiltonian
describing energy of oscillating electronic cloud wrapped around nanoparticle
is mathematically derived to be equal to product of integral of electron
density and its position vector overall space multiplied with net electric
force acting on the oscillating electronic cloud of nanoparticle.

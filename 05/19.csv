on the same qubit. Alice prepares a qubit in one of two possible states. The
qubit is first sent to Bob, who measures it, and then on to Charlie, who also

In an unambiguous state discrimination measurement, we never make a mistake,
i.e. misidentify the state, but the measurement may fail, in which case we gain
no information about which state was sent. We find that there is a nonzero
probability for both Bob and Charlie to identify the state, and we maximize
this probability. The probability that Charlie's measurement succeeds depends
on how much information about the state Alice sent is left in the qubit after
Bob's measurement, and this information can be quantified by the overlap
between the two possible states in which Bob's measurement leaves the qubit.
This paper is a first step toward developing a theory of nondestructive
sequential quantum measurements, which could be useful in quantum communication
schemes.

results: convergence occurs if the starting point is not too far away from
solutions to avoid getting trapped in certain regions. Instead of taking full
projection steps, it can be advantageous to underrelax, i.e., to move only part
way towards the constraint set, in order to enlarge the regions of convergence.
In this paper, we thus systematically study the Method of Alternating Relaxed

its pre-main-sequence demographic. Four Wolf-Rayet stars in the cluster core

members, and their inferred luminosities are consistent with those of other
late-WN stars in open clusters. The color-magnitude diagram for Westerlund~2
also displays a gap at spectral type B0.5 V with associated color spread at
higher and lower absolute magnitudes that might be linked to close binary
mergers. Such features, in conjunction with the evidence for mass loss from the

Topological enhancement of the nonlinear response of quantum graphs is even

accuracy criteria which are required to construct an ensemble classifier where
the former criterion is obtained by the various input parameter values and the
latter is achieved due to the decorrelation and noise reduction properties of
dimensionality reduction. In order to classify a test sample, it is first
embedded into the dimension reduced space of each individual classifier by
using an out-of-sample extension algorithm. Each classifier is then applied to
the embedded sample and the classification is obtained via a voting scheme. We

comparable with a phase transition by spontaneous symmetry breaking, and makes
the process of decoherence and classicality a natural fate of complex systems

the property of state space as a vector space representing symmetries is more

medium-baseline event rates to include charged current interactions at source

structure. We find that the average spectrum of observed events at a baseline
of 50 km, in the middle of the currently favored region, provides a probe of
new interactions. We show that an improvement in sensitivity to nonstandard
interactions is possible if combined with improved precision of input mixing
parameters in independent experiments, despite ambiguity in interpretation of
medium-baseline data. We show that nonstandard interactions can enhance or
suppress the sensitivity of experiments to the mass hierarchy, depending on the
phases of the parameters and the CP-violating phase in the standard
three-neutrino mixing picture.

model of pi N and gamma N reactions up to the invariant mass W = 2 GeV. The
meson-baryon (MB) channels included in the calculations are MB = pi N, eta N, K
Lambda, K Sigma, and pi pi N that has pi Delta, rho N, and sigma N resonant
components. The meson-baryon amplitudes T_{M'B',MB}(W) are calculated from
solving a set of coupled-channels integral equations defined by an interaction
Hamiltonian consisting of (a) meson-exchange interactions v_{M'B',MB} derived
from phenomenological Lagrangian, and (b) vertex interactions N* --> MB for
describing the transition of a bare excited nucleon state N* to a channel MB.
The parameters of v_{M'B',MB} are mainly constrained by the fit to the data of
pi N --> pi N in the low energy region up to W =1.4 GeV. The bare masses of N*
and the N* --> MB parameters are then determined in simultaneous fits to the
data of pi N --> pi N up to W =2.3 GeV and those of pi N --> eta N, K Lambda, K
Sigma and gamma N --> pi N, eta N, K Lambda, K Sigma up to W = 2.1 GeV. The
pole positions and residues of nucleon resonances are extracted by analytically
continuing the meson-baryon amplitudes T_{M'B',MB}(W) to the complex Riemann
energy surface. From the extracted residues, we have determined the N* --> pi
N, gamma N, eta N, K Lambda, K Sigma transition amplitudes at resonance poles.
We compare the resonance pole positions from our analysis with those given by
Particle Data Group and the recent coupled-channels analyses by the Juelich and
Bonn-Gatchina groups. Four results agree well only for the first N* in each
spin-parity-isospin (J^P,I) channel. For higher mass states, the number of
states and their resonance positions from four results do not agree well. We
discuss the possible sources of the discrepancies and the need of additional
data from new hadron facilities such as J-PARC.

selection ascribed cause to costs, benefits, and genetic relatedness. The
theory then slowly developed a deeper and more sophisticated approach to
partitioning the causes of social evolution. Controversy followed because
causal analysis inevitably attracts opposing views. It is always possible to
separate total effects into different component causes. Alternative causal
schemes emphasize different aspects of a problem, reflecting the distinct
goals, interests, and biases of different perspectives. For example, group
selection is a particular causal scheme with certain advantages and significant
limitations. Ultimately, to use kin selection theory to analyze natural
patterns and to understand the history of debates over different approaches,
one must follow the underlying history of causal analysis. This article
describes the history of kin selection theory, with emphasis on how the causal
perspective improved through the study of key patterns of natural history, such
as dispersal and sex ratio, and through a unified approach to demographic and
social processes. Independent historical developments in the multivariate
analysis of quantitative traits merged with the causal analysis of social

at 1450A. Utilizing improved spectrophotometric flux calibrations relative to
nearby compact stars observed simultaneously, we are able to measure the flux
changes in Lyman alpha and the nearby continuum at two epochs. We find 20
objects that exhibit Lyman alpha BEL flux variability at a significance level
greater than 5 sigma on time-scales ranging from days to years in the quasar
rest frame. The results show that, although some earlier work showed no
significant detections of Lyman alpha BEL flux changes in a quasar sample with
even higher luminosity, variability is present and readily observable in the
sample studied here. We also consider the CIV lambda1549 BEL. The lack of a
strong correlation between Lyman alpha BEL variability and nearby continuum
variability is consistent with the presence of a time lag between the
variations, whereas the presence of a stronger correlation between Lyman alpha
BEL variability and CIV BEL variability suggests that these BEL regions (BELRs)
are at similar distances from the central ionizing source. Some interesting
examples are high-lighted in the analysis, including a case where the flux of
an Lyman alpha BEL increased by ~26% in 14 days in the quasar rest frame,
suggesting that the BELR has the shape of a disc, which is being observed
face-on. This work demonstrates that future campaigns of spectrophotometric
monitoring can improve our understanding of the structure of the BELRs of
high-luminosity, high-redshift quasars.

of genetics, and have attracted considerable recent interest in genome-wide
association studies (GWASs). However, fitting mvLMMs is computationally
non-trivial, and no existing method is computationally practical for performing
the likelihood ratio test (LRT) for mvLMMs in GWAS settings with moderate
sample size n. The existing software MTMM perform an approximate LRT for two
phenotypes, and as we find, its p values can substantially understate the
significance of associations. Here, we present novel computationally-efficient
algorithms for fitting mvLMMs, and computing the LRT in GWAS settings. After a
single initial eigen-decomposition (with complexity O(n^3)) the algorithms i)
reduce computational complexity (per iteration of the optimizer) from cubic to
linear in n; and ii) in GWAS analyses, reduces per-marker complexity from cubic
to quadratic in n. These innovations make it practical to compute the LRT for
mvLMMs in GWASs for tens of thousands of samples and a moderate number of
phenotypes (~2-10). With simulations, we show that the LRT provides correct
control for type I error. With both simulations and real data we find that the
LRT is more powerful than the approximate LRT from MTMM, and illustrate the
benefits of analyzing more than two phenotypes. The method is implemented in

moving in a classical monochromatic electromagnetic plane wave in a medium of
index of refraction n < 1. The found solutions are expressed in terms of new
complex trigonometric polynomials, which form a doubly infinite set labeled by
two integer quantum numbers. These quantum numbers represent quantized spectra
of the energy-momentum components of the charged particle along the
polarization vector and along the propagation direction of the applied
electromagnetic plane wave field (which is considered as a laser field of
arbitrary high intensity, propagating in an underdense plasma). These new
solutions may serve as a basis for the description of possible quantum features
of mechanisms of acceleration of electrons by high-intensity laser fields.

penetration of random renewable resources increases. In particular, operators
face the risk of not scheduling enough traditional generators in the times when
renewable energies becomes lower than expected. In this paper we study the
optimal trade-off between system and risk, and the cost of scheduling reserve
generators. We explicitly model the ramping constraints on the generators. We
model the problem as a multi-period stochastic control problem, and we show the
structure of the optimal dispatch. We then show how to efficiently compute the
dispatch using two methods: i) solving a surrogate chance constrained program,
ii) a MPC-type look ahead controller. Using real world data, we show the chance
constrained dispatch outperforms the MPC controller and is also robust to
changes in the probability distribution of the renewables.

the present study we consider the surfaces in Euclidean 4-space E^4 given with
a Monge patch z=f(u,v),w=g(u,v). We investigated the curvature properties of

first defined by Yu. Aminov. Finally, we proved that every Aminov surface is a
non-trivial Chen surface.

Coulomb atomic bound state wave functions of a neutral hydrogen gas, our
production rate results are in agreement with recent estimates by Maiani {\it

preventing its adoption in practice. This cost stems from the need to maintain
at least 3t+1 replicas in different storage servers in the asynchronous model,
so that t Byzantine replica faults can be tolerated. In this paper, we present
MDStore, the first fully asynchronous read/write BFT storage protocol that
reduces the number of data replicas to as few as 2t+1, maintaining 3t+1
replicas of metadata at (possibly) different servers. At the heart of MDStore
store is its metadata service that is built upon a new abstraction we call
timestamped storage. Timestamped storage both allows for conditional writes
(facilitating the implementation of a metadata service) and has consensus
number one (making it implementable wait-free in an asynchronous system despite
faults). In addition to its low data replication factor, MDStore offers very
strong guarantees implementing multi-writer multi-reader atomic wait-free
semantics and tolerating any number of Byzantine readers and crash-faulty
writers. We further show that MDStore data replication overhead is optimal;
namely, we prove a lower bound of 2t+1 on the number of data replicas that
applies even to crash-tolerant storage with a fault-free metadata service
oracle. Finally, we prove that separating data from metadata for reducing the
cost of BFT storage is not possible without cryptographic assumptions. However,
our MDStore protocol uses only lightweight cryptographic hash functions.

respect to magnetization reversal, where in the limit of vanishing disorder the
even SOT is given by the constant Berry curvature of the occupied states, while
the odd part exhibits a divergence with respect to disorder strength. Within
this formalism, we perform first principles density-functional theory

the even and odd torque components to be of comparable magnitude. Moreover, the
odd torque depends strongly on an additional capping layer, while the even
torque is less sensitive. We show that the even torque is nearly entirely
mediated by spin currents in contrast to the odd torque, which can contain an
important contribution not due to spin transfer. Our results are in agreement

main theoretical approachs. One involves substituting the quantum system with a

other treats the transport in the semiclassical approximation and studies
correlations among sets of classical trajectories. There are established
evaluation procedures within the semiclassical evaluation that, for several
linear and non-linear transport moments to which they were applied, have always
resulted in the agreement with random matrix predictions. We prove that this
agreement is universal: any semiclassical evaluation within the accepted
procedures is equivalent to the evaluation within random matrix theory.
  The equivalence is shown by developing a combinatorial interpretation of the
trajectory sets as ribbon graphs (maps) with certain properties and exhibiting
systematic cancellations among their contributions. Remaining trajectory sets
can be identified with primitive (palindromic) factorisations whose number
gives the coefficients in the corresponding expansion of the moments of random

three-loop amplitudes of half-maximal supergravity with matter multiplets and
show that new divergences occur in D=4 and D=5. Bossard, Howe and Stelle have
recently conjectured the existence of 16-supercharge off-shell harmonic
superspaces in order to explain the ultraviolet finiteness of pure half-maximal
supergravity with no matter multiplets in D=4 at three loops and in D=5 at two
loops. By assuming the required superspace exists in D=5, they argued that no
new divergences should occur at two loops even with the addition of
abelian-vector matter multiplets. Up to possible issues with the SL(2,R) global
anomaly of the theory, they reached a similar conclusion in D=4 for two and
three loops. The divergences we find contradict these predictions based on the
existence of the desired off-shell superspaces. Furthermore, our D=4 results
are incompatible with the new divergences being due to the anomaly. We find
that the two-loop divergences of half-maximal supergravity are directly
controlled by the divergences appearing in ordinary nonsupersymmetric
Yang-Mills theory coupled to scalars, explaining why half-maximal supergravity
develops new divergences when matter multiplets are added. We also provide a
list of one- and two-loop counterterms that should be helpful for constraining
any future potential explanations of the observed vanishings of divergences in
pure half-maximal supergravity.

$\omega$ a bounded smooth domain of $\mathbb R^2$, from boundary observations.
The observation is given by the Dirichlet to Neumann map associated to a wave
equation. We prove a H\""older stability estimate in the determination of $q$
from the Dirichlet to Neumann map. Moreover, provided that the gap between two
electric potentials rich its maximum in a fixed bounded subset of

characterized by one of two competing opinions, say opinion -1 and opinion +1.
This population is further divided into groups of common size s. In the
bottom-up hierarchical system, each group elects a representative candidate,
whereas in the other two models, all the members of each group discuss at
random times until they reach a consensus. At each election/discussion, the
winning opinion is chosen according to Galam's majority rule: the opinion with
the majority of representants wins when there is a strict majority while one
opinion, say opinion -1, is chosen by default in case of a tie. For the public
debate models, we also consider the following natural updating rule that we
shall call proportional rule: the winning opinion is chosen at random with a
probability equal to the fraction of its supporters in the group. The three
models differ in term of their population structure: in the bottom-up

  8-27, 2012, Corfu, Greece",,,,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  If the only contribution to neutrinoless double beta decay (NLDBD) are
neutrino masses its discovery may be very difficult, especially if neutrinos
present a normal hierarchy spectrum. However, this is not the only possibility;
NLDBD can in general produce electrons of either chirality, in contrast with
the neutrino induced NLDBD which predicts two left-handed electrons. Using an
effective Lagrangian approach we classify the lepton number violating (LNV)
effective operators with two leptons of either chirality but no quarks, ordered
according to the magnitude of their contribution to NLDBD. We point out that,
for each of the three chirality assignments, $e_{L}e_{L},e_{L}e_{R}$ and
$e_{R}e_{R}$, there is only one LNV operator of the corresponding type to
lowest order, and these have dimensions 5, 7 and 9, respectively. Neutrino
masses are always induced by these extra operators but can be delayed to one
(dimension 7) or two loops (dimension 9). Under the assumption that NLDBD is
dominated by the operators of dimension 7 or 9 we find that the scale of new
physics should be relatively low ($\lesssim 30$ TeV). We also list the SM
additions generating these operators upon integration of the heavy modes, and
discuss simple realistic examples of renormalizable theories for each case. The
phenomenology of a model giving rise to the dimension 9 operator has been
analyzed with some detail: if NLDBD is going to be seen in the next round of
experiments, the doubly charged scalars of the model could be seen at the LHC
and lepton flavour violating (LFV) rates could be at the reach of foreseen
experiments. Moreover neutrino masses, which arise at two loops, display a very
particular structure and are strongly constrained, in fact,
$\sin^{2}\theta_{13}\gtrsim0.008$, when $\mu\rightarrow eee$ is required to lie
below its present experimental limit.

X-ray flux variability which we associate with changes in the intrinsic AGN
power-law. The increasing sensitivity of ongoing and new hard X-ray surveys
means that more such reflection-dominated AGN ought to be uncovered in the near
future. ESO 565--G019 is hosted in an early-type galaxy whose morphology has
been variously classified as either type E or type S0. Only about 20 bona fide
CT-AGN have been identified in the local universe so far, and all exist in host
galaxies with late Hubble types (S0 or later). CT columns of nuclear obscuring
gas are uncommon in early-type galaxies in the local universe, so confirmation
of the exact morphological class of ESO 565--G019 is important. Infrared
photometry also shows the presence of large quantities of cool dust in the
host, indicative of significant ongoing star-formation. ESO 565--G019 may be
the first identified local example of minor-merger driven CT-AGN growth in an

While the necessity, benefit and complexity of network coding are sensitive to
the underlying graph structure of a network, existing theory on network coding
often treats the network topology as a black box, focusing on algebraic or
information theoretic aspects of the problem. This work aims at an in-depth
examination of the relation between algebraic coding and network topologies. We
mathematically establish a series of results along the direction of: if network
coding is necessary/beneficial, or if a particular finite field is required for
coding, then the network must have a corresponding hidden structure embedded in
its underlying topology, and such embedding is computationally efficient to
verify. Specifically, we first formulate a meta-conjecture, the NC-Minor
Conjecture, that articulates such a connection between graph theory and network
coding, in the language of graph minors. We next prove that the NC-Minor
Conjecture is almost equivalent to the Hadwiger Conjecture, which connects
graph minors with graph coloring. Such equivalence implies the existence of
$K_4$, $K_5$, $K_6$, and $K_{O(q/\log{q})}$ minors, for networks requiring
$\mathbb{F}_3$, $\mathbb{F}_4$, $\mathbb{F}_5$ and $\mathbb{F}_q$,
respectively. We finally prove that network coding can make a difference from
routing only if the network contains a $K_4$ minor, and this minor containment
result is tight. Practical implications of the above results are discussed.

Ghilardi's characterization in the parameter-free case, leading to new proofs
of Rybakov's results that admissibility with parameters is decidable and
unification is finitary for logics satisfying suitable frame extension
properties (called cluster-extensible logics in this paper). We construct
explicit bases of admissible rules with parameters for cluster-extensible
logics, and give their semantic description. We show that in the case of
finitely many parameters, these logics have independent bases of admissible
rules, and determine which logics have finite bases.
  As a sideline, we show that cluster-extensible logics have various nice
properties: in particular, they are finitely axiomatizable, and have an
exponential-size model property. We also give a rather general characterization
of logics with directed (filtering) unification.

processes were not accessible at earlier hadron colliders such as the Tevatron.
Therefore, observation of these rare processes at the LHC will be a test of the
standard model itself. Like the di-vector boson production via gluon fusion
processes, these processes are also important backgrounds for many new physics
signals, and the standard model Higgs boson signal at the LHC. These leading
order gluon fusion processes contribute to the corresponding hadronic processes

extra-dimensions, the ADD (Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos and Dvali) model, as the

hierarchy problem of the standard model by proposing large extra space
dimensions which may be accessible at TeV scale. We have considered the direct

5-24% for the Tail. The H-alpha emission has a complex multiple-component

the extragalactic background and the Milky Way alone are insufficient to
produced the observed ionization in the Magellanic Bridge and present a model

high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) candidates in NGC 300 and NGC 2403 as determined
from combined Chandra/HST analysis. We have fit the color-magnitude
distribution of the surrounding stars with stellar evolution models. All but
one region in NGC 300 and two in NGC 2403 contain a population with an age
between 20 and 70 Myr. One of the candidates is the ultraluminous X-ray source
(ULX) in NGC 2403, which we associate with a 60 Myr old population. These age
distributions provide additional evidence that 16 of these 18 candidates are
HMXBs. Furthermore, our results suggest that the most common HMXB age in these
galaxies is 40-55 Myr. This preferred age is similar to observations of HMXBs
in the Small Magellanic Cloud, providing new evidence of this formation
timescale, but in higher metallicity populations. We suggest that this
preferred HMXB age is the result of the fortuitous combination of two physical
effects. First, this is the age of a population when the greatest rate of
core-collapse events should be occurring, maximizing neutron star production.
Second, this is the age when B stars are most likely to be actively losing
mass. We also discuss our results in the context of HMXB feedback in galaxies,
confirming HMXBs as a potentially important source of energy for the
interstellar medium in low-mass galaxies.

The Chandra observation reveals the cluster to be undergoing a merger event.
The VLA observations show the presence of large-scale diffuse emission in the
central region of the cluster, which we classify as a 0.9 Mpc size radio halo.
In addition, a complex region of diffuse, polarized emission is found in the
southeastern outskirts of the cluster, along the projected merger axis of the
system. We classify this region of diffuse emission as a radio relic. The total
extent of this radio relic is 1.9 Mpc. For the combined emission in the cluster
region, we find a radio spectral index of -1.0 \pm 0.1 between 74 MHz and 1.4
GHz. The morphology of the radio relic is peculiar, as the relic is broken up
into five fragments. This suggests that the shock responsible for the relic has
been broken up due to interaction with a large-scale galaxy filament connected
to the cluster or other substructures in the ICM. Alternatively, the complex
morphology reflects the presence of electrons in fossil radio bubbles that are
re-accelerated by a shock.

more complex and extended than seen in earlier HST observations. The filaments
are associated with a faint blue continuum light (possibly from young stars)
and faint H-alpha emission. It seems likely that the cold gas and dust has been
stripped from a companion galaxy now seen as a secondary nucleus. There are
dusty filaments aligned with the base of the jets on both eastern and western
sides of the galaxy. The morphology of the filaments is different on the two
sides - the western filaments are fairly straight, while the eastern filaments
are mainly in two loop-like structures. We suggest that despite the difference
in morphologies, both sets of filaments have been entrained in a slow moving
boundary layer outside the relativistic flow. As suggested by Fabian et al.
(2008), magnetic fields in the filaments may stabilize them against disruption.
We consider a speculative scenario to explain the relation between the radio
source and the shock and cavities in the hot ICM seen in the Chandra data
(Nulsen et al. 2005). We suggest the radio source originally (~60 Myr ago)
propagated along a position angle of ~35 degrees where it created the shock and
cavities. The radio source axis changed to its current orientation (~100
degrees) possibly due to a supermassive black hole merger and began its current
epoch of activity about 20 Myr ago.

monitor the source in the UV/X-ray bands, and in the radio band. We find three
statistically acceptable spectral models, a disk-reflection model, a jet-model

disk-reflection model violates the radio constraints on the inclination, and
the jet-model has a fine-tuning problem, requiring a jet contribution exceeding
that expected. Thus, we argue for a composite jet+disk model. Within the
context of this model, we verify the basic predictions of the jet-cycle
paradigm, finding a truncated/refilling disk during the Suzaku observations and
a complete disk extending down to the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO)
during the XMM-Newton observation. The idea of a refilling disk is further
supported by the detection of the ejection of a new jet knot approximately one
month after the Suzaku pointings. We also discover a step-like event in one of
the Suzaku pointings in which the soft band lags the hard band. We suggest that
we are witnessing the propagation of a disturbance from the disk into the jet

including the evolution of the broad line profiles, of all the sources

narrow line luminosities, widths, shapes, ionization conditions and time
variability, which we can broadly ascribe to 4 classes based on the shape of
the broad line profiles: 1) Objects with bell-shaped broad lines with big
velocity shifts (>1000 km/s) compared to their narrow lines show a variety of
broad line widths and luminosities, modest flux variations over a few years,
and no significant change in the broad line peak wavelength. 2) Objects with
double-peaked broad emission lines tend to show very luminous and broadened
lines, and little time variability. 3) Objects with asymmetric broad emission
lines show a broad range of broad line luminosities and significant variability
of the line profiles. 4) The remaining sources tend to show moderate to low

trigger limit-cycle oscillations between a supercritically accreting X-ray
bright state and a subcritically accreting X-ray dim state. Time evolution of
the debris gas around a black hole with mass $M=10^{6} {\MO}$ is studied by
performing axisymmetric, two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations. We
assumed the $\alpha$-prescription of viscosity, in which the viscous stress is
proportional to the total pressure. The mass supply rate from the outer
boundary is assumed to be ${\dot M}_{\rm supply}=100L_{\rm Edd}/c^2$, where
$L_{\rm Edd}$ is the Eddington luminosity, and $c$ is the light speed. Since
the mass accretion rate decreases inward by outflows driven by radiation
pressure, the state transition from a supercritically accreting slim disk state
to a subcritically accreting Shakura-Sunyaev disk starts from the inner disk
and propagates outward in a timescale of a day. The sudden drop of the X-ray
flux observed in Swift J1644+57 in August 2012 can be explained by this
transition. As long as ${\dot M}_{\rm supply}$ exceeds the threshold for the
existence of a radiation pressure dominant disk, accumulation of the accreting
gas in the subcritically accreting region triggers the transition from a gas
pressure dominant Shakura-Sunyaev disk to a slim disk. This transition takes
place at $t {\sim}~50/({\alpha}/0.1)$ days after the X-ray darkening. We expect
that if $\alpha > 0.01$, X-ray emission with luminosity $\gtrsim 10^{44}$ ${\rm
erg}{\cdot}{\rm s}^{-1}$ and jet ejection will revive in Swift J1644+57 in

or debris disks. We use these long-slit spectra to investigate the origin of
the 24 um emission and the nature of these stars. A possible explanation for
the observed 24 um excess, that these are emission line stars with dusty
excretion disks, is disproven for the majority of our sources. We find that 88
of these objects are normal stars without line emission, with spectral types
mostly ranging from late-O to early-B; luminosity classes a sub-set of our
sample indicate that most are main-sequence stars. We further identify 17
emission-line stars, 7 possible emission-line stars, and 5 other stars with
forbidden-line emission. We discover a new O6 Iaf star; it exhibits strong HeII
4686 A emission but relatively weak NIII 4640 A emission that we attribute to
the lower nitrogen abundance in the SMC. Two other objects are identified with
planetary nebulae, one with a young stellar object, and two with X-ray
binaries. To shed additional light on the nature of the observed 24 um excess
we use optical and infrared photometry to estimate the dust properties of the
objects with normal O and B star spectra and compare these properties to those
of a sample of hot spots in the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM). We find
that the dust properties of the dusty OB star sample resemble the properties of
the Galactic sample of hot spots. Some may be runaway systems with bow-shocks
resulting from a large velocity difference between star and ISM. We further
investigate the nature of these dusty OB stars in a companion paper presenting

Paper I, we use optical spectroscopy to show that it is unlikely for any of
these sources to be classical Be stars or Herbig Ae/Be stars. We focus our
analysis on debris disks and cirrus hot spots. We find three out of twenty
stars to be significantly extended in the mid-IR, establishing them as cirrus
hot spots. We then fit the IR spectral energy distributions to determine dust
temperatures and masses. We find the dust masses in the SMC stars to be larger
than for any known debris disks, although this evidence against the debris disk
hypothesis is circumstantial. Finally, we created a local comparison sample of
bright mid-IR OB stars in the Milky Way (MW) by cross-matching the WISE and
Hipparcos catalogs. All such local stars in the appropriate luminosity range
that can be unambiguously classified are young stars with optical emission
lines or are spatially resolved by WISE with sizes too large to be plausible
debris disk candidates. We conclude that the very strong mid-IR flux excesses
are most likely explained as cirrus hot spots, although we cannot rigorously
rule out that a small fraction of the sample is made up of debris disks or
transition disks. We present suggestive evidence that bow-shock heating around
runaway stars may be a contributing mechanism to the interstellar emission.
These sources, interpreted as cirrus hot spots, offer a new localised probe of
diffuse interstellar dust in a low metallicity environment. (Abridged)

measurements for Alpha Cen B, a star hosting an Earth-mass planet candidate in
a 3.24 day orbit. The goal is to devise robust ways of extracting low-amplitude
RV signals of low mass planets in the presence of activity noise. Two
approaches were used to remove the stellar activity signal which dominates the
RV variations: 1) Fourier component analysis (pre-whitening), and 2) local
trend filtering (LTF) of the activity using short time windows of the data. The
Fourier procedure results in a signal at P = 3.236 days and K = 0.42 m/s which
is consistent with the presence of an Earth-mass planet, but the false alarm
probability for this signal is rather high at a few percent. The LTF results in
no significant detection of the planet signal, although it is possible to
detect a marginal planet signal with this method using a different choice of
time windows and fitting functions. However, even in this case the significance
of the 3.24-d signal depends on the details of how a time window containing
only 10% of the data is filtered. Both methods should have detected the
presence of Alpha Cen Bb at a higher significance than is actually seen. We
also investigated the influence of random noise with a standard deviation
comparable to the HARPS data and sampled in the same way. The distribution of
the noise peaks in the period range 2.8 - 3.3 days have a maximum of
approximately 3.2 days and amplitudes approximately one-half of the K-amplitude
for the planet. The presence of the activity signal may boost the velocity
amplitude of these signals to values comparable to the planet. It may be
premature to attribute the 3.24 day RV variations to an Earth-mass planet. A
better understanding of the noise characteristics in the RV data as well as
more measurements with better sampling will be needed to confirm this
exoplanet.

malaria. Currently, science has been established about its cellular structures,
its metabolic processes, and even the molecular structures of its intrinsic
membrane proteins responsible for transporting water, nutrient, and waste
molecules across the parasite plasma membrane (PPM). I hypothesize that
Plasmodium falciparum has an Achilles' heel that can be attacked with
erythritol, the well-known sweetener that is classified as generally safe. Most
organisms have in their cell membrane two types of water-channel proteins:
aquaporins to maintain hydro-homeostasis across the membrane and
aquaglyceroporins to uptake glycerols etc. In contrast, P. falciparum has only
one type of such proteins---the multi-functional aquaglyceroporin (PfAQP)
expressed in the PPM---to do both jobs. Moreover, the parasite also uses PfAQP
to excrete its metabolic wastes (ammonia included) produced at a very high rate
in the blood stage. This extremely high efficiency of the bug using one protein
for multiple essential tasks makes the parasite fatally vulnerable. Erythritol
in the blood stream can kill the parasite by clogging up its PfAQP channel that
needs to be open for maintaining hydro-homeostasis and for excreting toxic
wastes across the bug's PPM. In vitro tests are to measure the growth/death
rate of P. falciparum in blood with various erythritol concentrations. In vivo
experiments are to administer groups of infected mice with various doses of
erythritol and monitor the parasite growth levels from blood samples drawn from
each group. Clinic trials can be performed to observe the added effects of
administering to patients erythritol along with the known drugs because
erythritol was classified as a safe food ingredient.

galaxies for which the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging is available and
compare them to the large scale kinematics obtained with the SAURON
integral-field spectrograph. Specific angular momentum, lambda_R, correlates
with the shape of nuclear light profiles, where cores are typically found in
slow rotators and core-less galaxies are fast rotators. Cores are found only in
massive galaxies and only in systems with the stellar mass M>8x10^10 Msun.
Based on our sample, we, however, see no evidence for a bimodal distribution of
nuclear slopes. The best predictor for finding a core is based on the stellar
velocity dispersion within an effective radius, sigma_e, and specific angular
momentum, where cores are found for lambda_R<0.25 and sigma_e>160 km/s. We
estimate that only about 10% of nearby early-type galaxies contain cores.
Furthermore, we show that there is a genuine population of fast rotators with
cores. We also show that core fast rotators are morphologically, kinematically
and dynamically different from core slow rotators. The cores of fast rotators
could harbour black holes of similar masses to those in core slow rotators, but
typically more massive than those found in core-less fast rotators. Core-less
galaxies, and especially core-less fast rotators, are under-luminous in the
diffuse X-ray emission, but the presence of a core does not imply high X-ray
luminosities. We postulate a possible population of core-less galaxies among
slow rotators, which can not be explained as face-on discs, but comprise a
genuine sub-population of slow rotators. These galaxies are typically less
massive and flatter than core slow rotators, and show evidence for dynamical
cold structures and exponential photometric components. We discuss possible
processes for formation of cores and their subsequent preservation.

beamforming gains in single-user (SU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and
multiplexing gains in multi-user (MU) MIMO wireless communication systems.
State-of-the-art limited feedback schemes, which rely on pre-defined codebooks
for channel quantization, are only appropriate for a small number of transmit
antennas and low feedback overhead. In order to scale informed transmitter
schemes to emerging massive MIMO systems with a large number of transmit
antennas at the base station, one common approach is to employ time division
duplexing (TDD) and to exploit the implicit feedback obtained from channel
reciprocity. However, most existing cellular deployments are based on frequency
division duplexing (FDD), hence it is of great interest to explore backwards
compatible massive MIMO upgrades of such systems. For a fixed feedback rate per
antenna, the number of codewords for quantizing the channel grows exponentially
with the number of antennas, hence generating feedback based on look-up from a
standard vector quantized codebook does not scale. In this paper, we propose
noncoherent trellis-coded quantization (NTCQ), whose encoding complexity scales
linearly with the number of antennas. The approach exploits the duality between
source encoding in a Grassmannian manifold and noncoherent sequence detection.
Furthermore, since noncoherent detection can be realized near-optimally using a
bank of coherent detectors, we obtain a low-complexity implementation of NTCQ
encoding using an off-the-shelf Viterbi algorithm applied to standard trellis
coded quantization. We also develop advanced NTCQ schemes which utilize various
channel properties such as temporal/spatial correlations. Simulation results
show the proposed NTCQ and its extensions can achieve near-optimal performance
with moderate complexity and feedback overhead.

monitoring and study of massive, online social networks. We study the problem
of how to estimate the degree distribution - an object of fundamental interest
- of a true underlying network from its sampled network. In particular, we show
that this problem can be formulated as an inverse problem. Playing a key role
in this formulation is a matrix relating the expectation of our sampled degree
distribution to the true underlying degree distribution. Under many network
sampling designs, this matrix can be defined entirely in terms of the design
and is found to be ill-conditioned. As a result, our inverse problem frequently
is ill-posed. Accordingly, we offer a constrained, penalized weighted
least-squares approach to solving this problem. A Monte Carlo variant of
Stein's unbiased risk estimation (SURE) is used to select the penalization
parameter. We explore the behavior of our resulting estimator of network degree
distribution in simulation, using a variety of combinations of network models
and sampling regimes. In addition, we demonstrate the ability of our method to
accurately reconstruct the degree distributions of various sub-communities
within online social networks corresponding to Friendster, Orkut and
LiveJournal. Overall, our results show that the true degree distributions from
both homogeneous and inhomogeneous networks can be recovered with substantially
greater accuracy than reflected in the empirical degree distribution resulting

multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar with colocated antennas in
application to direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. A new method for
designing the transmit beamspace matrix that enables the use of search-free DOA
estimation techniques at the receiver is introduced. The essence of the
proposed method is to design the transmit beamspace matrix based on minimizing
the difference between a desired transmit beampattern and the actual one under
the constraint of uniform power distribution across the transmit array
elements. The desired transmit beampattern can be of arbitrary shape and is
allowed to consist of one or more spatial sectors. The number of transmit
waveforms is even but otherwise arbitrary. To allow for simple search-free DOA
estimation algorithms at the receive array, the rotational invariance property
is established at the transmit array by imposing a specific structure on the
beamspace matrix. Semi-definite relaxation is used to transform the proposed
formulation into a convex problem that can be solved efficiently. We also
propose a spatial-division based design (SDD) by dividing the spatial domain
into several subsectors and assigning a subset of the transmit beams to each
subsector. The transmit beams associated with each subsector are designed
separately. Simulation results demonstrate the improvement in the DOA
estimation performance offered by using the proposed joint and SDD transmit
beamspace design methods as compared to the traditional MIMO radar technique.

reshape the multidimensional signal into a 2D signal and sample the 2D signal
using compressed sensing column by column with the same sensing matrix. It is
referred to as parallel compressed sensing, and it has much lower storage and
computational complexity. For a given reconstruction performance of parallel
compressed sensing, if a so-called acceptable permutation is applied to the 2D
signal, we show that the corresponding sensing matrix has a smaller required
order of restricted isometry property condition, and thus, storage and
computation requirements are further lowered. A zigzag-scan-based permutation,
which is shown to be particularly useful for signals satisfying a layer model,
is introduced and investigated. As an application of the parallel compressed
sensing with the zigzag-scan-based permutation, a video compression scheme is
presented. It is shown that the zigzag-scan-based permutation increases the

scheme for the minimal supersymmetric standard model(MSSM) is still unknown. In
MSSM, we study the on-shell scheme for three vertexes$Z\bar{l^I}l^I,
W^+\bar{\nu^I}l^I $ and $\tilde{L}^*_i\bar{\chi^0_{\alpha}}l^I$ with virtual
SUSY particles (chargino, sneutrino, neutralino and slepton) at one-loop order.
Instead of amplitude of a single triangle diagram, the sum of amplitude of
triangle diagrams belonging to one suit can be renormalized in the on-shell
scheme. One suit points out that the internal virtual particles are consistent.
Zero-momentum scheme is also used for the renormalization. The two schemes can
make the renormalized results decoupled. In MSSM, some special characters of
the on-shell scheme are shown here. This work is propitious to complete the
on-shell renormalization scheme in MSSM.

Lobachevsky and Bolyai are discovered. Among the novel results are the
hyperbolic counterparts of important theorems in Euclidean geometry. These are:
(1) the Inscribed Gyroangle Theorem, (ii) the Gyrotangent-Gyrosecant Theorem,
(iii) the Intersecting Gyrosecants Theorem, and (iv) the Intersecting Gyrochord
Theorem. Here in gyrolanguage, the language of analytic hyperbolic geometry, we
prefix a gyro to any term that describes a concept in Euclidean geometry and in
associative algebra to mean the analogous concept in hyperbolic geometry and
nonassociative algebra. Outstanding examples are {\it gyrogroups} and {\it
gyrovector spaces}, and Einstein addition being both {\it gyrocommutative} and
{\it gyroassociative}. The prefix ""gyro"" stems from ""gyration"", which is the

conductivity at the crystalline LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface has been a topic of
debate. Metallic interfaces with similar electronic properties produced by
amorphous oxide overlayers on SrTiO3 have called in question the original
polarization catastrophe model. We resolve the issue by a comprehensive
comparison of (100)-oriented SrTiO3 substrates with crystalline and amorphous
overlayers of LaAlO3 of different thicknesses prepared under different oxygen
pressures. For both types of overlayers, there is a critical thickness for the
appearance of conductivity, but its value is always 4 unit cells (around 1.6
nm) for the oxygen-annealed crystalline case, whereas in the amorphous case,
the critical thickness could be varied in the range 0.5 to 6 nm according to
the deposition conditions. Subsequent ion milling of the overlayer restores the
insulating state for the oxygen-annealed crystalline heterostructures but not
for the amorphous ones. Oxygen post-annealing removes the oxygen vacancies, and
the interfaces become insulating in the amorphous case. However, the interfaces
with a crystalline overlayer remain conducting with reduced carrier density.
These results demonstrate that oxygen vacancies are the dominant source of
mobile carriers when the LaAlO3 overlayer is amorphous, while both oxygen
vacancies and polarization catastrophe contribute to the interface conductivity
in unannealed crystalline LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures, and the polarization
catastrophe alone accounts for the conductivity in oxygen-annealed crystalline
LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures. Furthermore, we find that the crystallinity of
the LaAlO3 layer is crucial for the polarization catastrophe mechanism in the
case of crystalline LaAlO3 overlayers.

define comfortable motion planning as a nonlinear constrained optimization
problem of computing trajectories that minimize this discomfort given the

that a four-sublattice triple-Q order induces three-dimensional massless Dirac
electrons at commensurate electron fillings. The Dirac state is doubly
degenerate, while it splits into a pair of Weyl nodes by lifting the degeneracy
by an external magnetic field; the system is turned into a Weyl semimetal in
applied field. In addition, we point out the triple-Q Hamiltonian in the strong
coupling limit is equivalent to the 3D \pi-flux model relevant to an AIII
topological insulator. We examine the stability of such a triple-Q order in two
fundamental models for correlated electron systems: a Kondo lattice model with
classical localized spins and a periodic Anderson model. For the Kondo lattice
model, performing a variational calculation and Monte Carlo simulation, we show
that the triple-Q order is widely stabilized around 1/4 filling. For the
periodic Anderson model, we also show the stability of the same triple-Q state
by using the mean-field approximation. For both models, the triple-Q order is
widely stabilized via the couplings between conduction electrons and localized
electrons even without any explicit competing magnetic interactions and
geometrical frustration. We also show that the Dirac electrons induce peculiar

interplay between these generalized Fisher information, the generalized
$q$-Gaussian distributions and the $q$-entropies. The minimum of the
generalized Fisher information among distributions with a fixed moment, or with
a fixed $q$-entropy is attained, in both cases, by a generalized $q$-Gaussian
distribution. This complements the fact that the $q$-Gaussians maximize the
$q$-entropies subject to a moment constraint, and yields new variational
characterizations of the generalized $q$-Gaussians. We show that the
generalized Fisher information naturally pop up in the expression of the time
derivative of the $q$-entropies, for distributions satisfying a certain
nonlinear heat equation. This result includes as a particular case the
classical de Bruijn identity. Then we study further properties of the
generalized Fisher information and of their minimization. We show that, though
non additive, the generalized Fisher information of a combined system is upper
bounded. In the case of mixing, we show that the generalized Fisher information
is convex for $q\geq1.$ Finally, we show that the minimization of the
generalized Fisher information subject to moment constraints satisfies a
Legendre structure analog to the Legendre structure of thermodynamics.

models for isothermal transformations in binary alloys and steps dynamics in
molecular-beam-epitaxy. The phase field equations of motion incorporate a
kinetic cross-coupling between the phase field and the concentration field.
This cross coupling generalizes the phenomenology of kinetic effects and was
omitted until recently in classical phase field models. We derive general
expressions (independent of the details of the phase field model) for the
kinetic coefficients within the corresponding macroscopic approach using a
physically motivated reduction procedure. The latter is equivalent to the
so-called thin interface limit but is technically simpler. It involves the
calculation of the effective dissipation that can be ascribed to the interface
in the phase field model. We discuss in details the possibility of a non
positive definite matrix of kinetic coefficients, i.e. a negative effective
interface dissipation, although being in the range of stability of the
underlying phase field model. Numerically, we study the step-bunching
instability in molecular-beam-epitaxy due to the Ehrlich-Schwoebel effect,
present in our model due to the cross-coupling. Using the reduction procedure
we compare the results of the phase field simulations with the analytical
predictions of the macroscopic approach.

  of Candidates","Accepted as an extended abstract in AAMAS 2014",,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Classical results in voting theory show that strategic manipulation by voters
is inevitable if a voting rule simultaneously satisfy certain desirable
properties. Motivated by this, we study the relevant question of how often a
voting rule is manipulable. It is well known that elections with a large number
of voters are rarely manipulable under impartial culture (IC) assumption.
However, the manipulability of voting rules when the number of candidates is
large has hardly been addressed in the literature and our paper focuses on this
problem. First, we propose two properties (1) asymptotic strategy-proofness and
(2) asymptotic collusion-proofness, with respect to new voters, which makes the
two notions more relevant from the perspective of computational problem of
manipulation. In addition to IC, we explore a new culture of society where all
score vectors of the candidates are equally likely. This new notion has its
motivation in computational social choice and we call it impartial scores
culture (ISC) assumption. We study asymptotic strategy-proofness and asymptotic
collusion-proofness for plurality, veto, $k$-approval, and Borda voting rules
under IC as well as ISC assumptions. Specifically, we prove bounds for the
fraction of manipulable profiles when the number of candidates is large. Our
results show that the size of the coalition and the tie-breaking rule play a
crucial role in determining whether or not a voting rule satisfies the above
two properties.

with prescribed surface area which are confined to a finite container. To this
end, we approximate the surface by a phase field function $u$ taking values
close to +1 on the inside of the surface and -1 on its outside. The confinement
of the surface is now simply given by the domain of definition of $u$. A
diffuse interface approximation for the area functional, as well as for the
Willmore energy are well known. We address the topological constraint of
connectedness by a nested minimization of two phase fields, the second one
being used to identify connected components of the surface. In this article, we
provide a proof of Gamma-convergence of our model to the sharp interface limit.

model parameters, such as the average (anti)instanton size,
inter-(anti)instanton distance, and constituent-quark mass at zero virtuality,
are modified as functions of T, employing the trivial-holonomy caloron
solution. By doing that, we observe correct chiral restoration patterns
depending on the current-quark mass m. We also perform the two-loop
renormalization-group (RG) evolution for the both condensates by increasing the
renormalization scale mu=(0.6~2.0) GeV. It turns out that the mixed condensate
is insensitive to the RG evolution, whereas the quark condensate become larger
considerably by the evolution. Numerically, we obtain -<qbar sigma*G q>^1/5 =
(0.45 ~ 0.46) GeV at T=0 within the present theoretical framework, and the
mixed condensate plays the role of the chiral order parameter for finite T. The
ratio of the two condensates m^2_0 is almost flat below the chiral transition T
(T_0), and increases rapidly beyond it. From a simple linear parametrization,
we obtain m^2_0(T)/m^2_0(0) ~ (0.07, 0.47) T/T_0 + (1,0.6) for (T<T_0, T>T_0)

and decoherence. For nanoscopic materials this may be a determining factor of
their physical behavior. However, even for macroscopic many-body systems, if
the strength of this coupling is sufficiently strong, their ground state
properties and phase diagram may be severely modified. Also dissipation is
essential to allow a system in the presence of a time dependent perturbation to
attain a steady, time independent state. In this case, the non-equilibrium
phase diagram depends on the intensity of the perturbation and on the strength
of the coupling of the system to the outside world. In this paper, we
investigate the effects of both, dissipation and time dependent external
sources in the phase diagram of a many-body system at zero and finite
temperatures. For concreteness we consider the specific case of a
superconducting layer under the action of an electric field and coupled to a
metallic substrate. The former arises from a time dependent vector potential
minimally coupled to the electrons in the layer. We introduce a Keldysh
approach that allows to obtain the time dependence of the superconducting order
parameter in an adiabatic regime. We study the phase diagram of this system as
a function of the electric field, the coupling to the metallic substrate and

provided ""theoretical evidence"" of a role for the Planck scale in
characterizing the geometry of momentum space. One of the main obstructions for
a full exploitation of this scenario is the understanding of the role of the
Planck-scale-curved geometry of momentum space in the correlations between
emission and detection times, the ""travel times"" for a particle to go from a
given emitter to a given detector. These travel times appear to receive
Planck-scale corrections for which no standard interpretation is applicable,
and the associated implications for spacetime locality gave rise to the notion
of ""relative locality"" which is still in the early stages of investigation. We
here show that these Planck-scale corrections to travel times can be described
as ""dual redshift"" (or ""lateshift""): they are manifestations of momentum-space
curvature of the same type already known for ordinary redshift produced by
spacetime curvature. In turn we can identify the novel notion of ""relative
momentum-space locality"" as a known but under-appreciated feature associated to
ordinary redshift produced by spacetime curvature, and this can be described in
complete analogy with the relative spacetime locality that became of interest
in the recent quantum-gravity literature. We also briefly comment on how these
findings may be relevant for an approach to the quantum-gravity problem
proposed by Max Born in 1938 and centered on Born duality.

Such measurements require the system to be both eclipsing and to show
absorption features from the secondary star. Prior to the work reported here,
the only dynamical mass estimate of a recurrent nova was for U Sco, which has a
white dwarf mass of 1.55 +/- 0.24 Msolar (Thoroughgood et al. 2001).

early A-type star. The high mass ratio of q = 2.35 +/- 0.24 and the high
secondary-star mass implies that the mass transfer occurs on a thermal
timescale. We suggest that CI Aql is rapidly evolving into a supersoft X-ray

surface temperature record and the deterministic component of the forcing are
used to estimate these parameters by means of the maximum-likelihood method.
The residual obtained by subtracting the deterministic solution from the

a long-memory time-series model and inconsistent with a short-memory model. By
decomposing the forcing record in contributions from solar, volcanic, and
anthropogenic activity one can estimate the contribution of each to 20'th
century global warming. The LRM model is applied with a reconstruction of the
forcing for the last millennium to predict the large-scale features of northern
hemisphere temperature reconstructions, and the analysis of the residual also
clearly favors the LRM model on millennium time scale. The decomposition of the

  differential games","to appear in SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We develop here the Stochastic Perron Method in the framework of two-player
zero-sum differential games. We consider the formulation of the game where both
players play, symmetrically, feed-back strategies (as in [CR09] or [PZ12]) as
opposed to the Elliott-Kalton formulation prevalent in the literature. The
class of feed-back strategies we use is carefully chosen so that the state
equation admits strong solutions and the technicalities involved in the
Stochastic Perron Method carry through in a rather simple way. More precisely,
we define the game over elementary strategies, which are well motivated by
intuition. Within this framework, the Stochastic Perron Method produces a
viscosity sub-solution of the upper Isaacs equation dominating the upper value
of the game, and a viscosity super-solution of the upper Isaacs equation lying
below the upper value of the game. Using a viscosity comparison result we
obtain that the upper value is the unique and continuous viscosity solution of
the upper Isaacs equation. An identical statement holds for the lower value and
lower Isaacs equation. A version of the Dynamic Programming Principle is
obtained as a by-product. If the Isaacs condition holds, the game has a value
over elementary (pure) strategies.

thermodynamic equilibrium is directly measured, assuming that quantum effects
can be neglected it coincides with temperature except for a proportionality
factor. This is due to the principle of energy equipartition and the
equilibrium hypothesis. However, most natural systems found in nature are not
in thermodynamic equilibrium and thus the principle cannot be granted. We
measured the extent to which the low-frequency modes of vibration of a solid
can defy energy equipartition, in presence of a steady state heat flux, even
close to equilibrium. We found, experimentally and numerically, that the energy
separately associated with low frequency normal modes strongly depends on the
heat flux, and decouples sensibly from temperature. A 4% in the relative
temperature difference across the object around room temperature suffices to
excite two modes of a macroscopic oscillator, as if they were at equilibrium,
respectively, at temperatures about 20% and a factor 3.5 higher. We interpret
the result in terms of new flux-mediated correlations between modes in the
nonequilibrium state, which are absent at equilibrium.

magnetization, exciting current-induced magnetization dynamics. So far, most
studies in this field have focused on the direct effect of spin transport on
magnetization dynamics, but ignored the feedback from the magnetization
dynamics to the spin transport and back to the magnetization dynamics. Although
the feedback is usually weak, there are situations when it can play an
important role in the dynamics. In such situations, self-consistent
calculations of the magnetization dynamics and the spin transport can
accurately describe the feedback. This review describes in detail the feedback
mechanisms, and presents recent progress in self-consistent calculations of the
coupled dynamics. We pay special attention to three representative examples,
where the feedback generates non-local effective interactions for the
magnetization. Possibly the most dramatic feedback example is the dynamic
instability in magnetic nanopillars with a single magnetic layer. This
instability does not occur without non-local feedback. We demonstrate that full
self-consistent calculations generate simulation results in much better
agreement with experiments than previous calculations that addressed the
feedback effect approximately. The next example is for more typical spin valve
nanopillars. Although the effect of feedback is less dramatic because even
without feedback the current can induce magnetization oscillation, the feedback
can still have important consequences. For instance, we show that the feedback
can reduce the linewidth of oscillations, in agreement with experimental
observations. Finally, we consider nonadiabatic electron transport in narrow
domain walls. The non-local feedback in these systems leads to a significant
renormalization of the effective nonadiabatic spin transfer torque.

can be taken as reference for the rest and the system can be described in terms
of its parts in a self-referential way. Some of the parts carry larger
information about the rest of the structure and they are identified as {\it
motifs}. We discuss how this method can efficiently reduce the amount of
information required to describe a complex disordered structure by encoding it
in a set of motifs and {\it matching rules}. We propose an
information-theoretic approach to define a {\it
self-referential-order-parameter} and we show that, by means of entropic
measures, such a parameter can be quantified explicitly. A proof of concept
application to equal disk packing is presented and discussed.

Dome Fuji, the second highest region on the Antarctic plateau, is
expected to have some of the best astronomical seeing on Earth. However, site
testing at Dome Fuji is still in its very early stages.
  Aims. To investigate the astronomical seeing in the free atmosphere above
Dome Fuji, and to determine the height of the surface boundary layer.
  Methods. A Differential Image Motion Monitor was used to measure the seeing
in the visible (472 nm) at a height of 11 m above the snow surface at Dome Fuji
during the austral summer of 2012/2013.
  Results. Seeing below 0.2'' has been observed. The seeing often has a local
minimum of ~0.3'' near 18 h local time. Some periods of excellent seeing, 0.3''
or smaller, were also observed, sometimes extending for several hours at local
midnight. The median seeing is higher, at 0.52''---this large value is believed
to be caused by periods when the telescope was within the turbulent boundary
layer.
  Conclusions. The diurnal variation of the daytime seeing at Dome Fuji is
similar to that reported for Dome C, and the height of the surface boundary
layer is consistent with previous simulations for Dome Fuji. The free
atmosphere seeing is ~0.2'', and the height of the surface boundary layer can
be as low as ~11 m.

interest. In this work, we have investigated the effect of disorder due to
chemical substitution on the dynamics and transport properties of correlated
Fermi liquids. A low frequency analysis in the concentrated and dilute limits
shows that the dynamical local potentials arising through disorder averaging
generate a linear (in frequency) term in the scattering rate. Such non-Fermi
liquid behaviour (nFL) is investigated in detail for Kondo hole substitution in
heavy fermions within dynamical mean field theory. We find closed form
expressions for the dependence of the static and linear terms in the scattering
rate on substitutional disorder and model parameters. We argue that the low
temperature resistivity will acquire a linear in temperature term, and show
that the Drude peak structure in the optical conductivity will disappear beyond
a certain disorder $p_c$, that marks the crossover from lattice coherent to
single-impurity behaviour. A full numerical solution of the DMFT equations
reveals that the nFL term will show up significantly only in certain regimes,
although it is present for any non-zero disorder concentration in principle. We
highlight the dramatic changes that occur in the quasiparticle scattering rate
in the proximity of $p_c$. Remarkably, we find that the nFL behaviour due to
dynamical effects of impurity scattering has features that are distinct from
those arising through Griffiths singularities or distribution of Kondo scales.
Relevance of our findings to experiments on alloyed correlated systems is
pointed out.

analytical treatment of the evolution of the envelop lost by the star within
the jet, and calculations of the related high-energy radiation. The model
readily explains the day-long, variable on timescales of hours, GeV gamma-ray
flare from 3C454.3, observed during November 2010 on top of a weeks-long
plateau. In the proposed scenario, the plateau state is caused by a strong wind
generated by the heating of the star atmosphere by nonthermal particles
accelerated at the jet-star interaction region. The flare itself could be
produced by a few clouds of matter lost by the red giant after the initial
impact of the jet. In the framework of the proposed scenario, the observations
constrain the key model parameters of the source, including the mass of the
central black hole: $M_{\rm BH}\simeq 10^9 M_{\odot}$, the total jet power:
$L_{\rm j}\simeq 10^{48}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$, and the Doppler factor of the

transformations and the related physical effects in finite quantum systems.
Some types of symmetry in finite systems can be broken only asymptotically.
However, with a sufficiently large number of particles, crossover transitions
become sharp, so that symmetry breaking happens similarly to that in
macroscopic systems. This concerns, in particular, global gauge symmetry
breaking, related to Bose-Einstein condensation and superconductivity, or
isotropy breaking, related to the generation of quantum vortices, and the
stratification in multicomponent mixtures. A special type of symmetry
transformation, characteristic only for finite systems, is the change of shape
symmetry. These phenomena are illustrated by the examples of several typical
mesoscopic systems, such as trapped atoms, quantum dots, atomic nuclei, and
metallic grains. The specific features of the review are: (i) the emphasis on
the peculiarities of the symmetry breaking in finite mesoscopic systems; (ii)
the analysis of common properties of physically different finite quantum
systems; (iii) the manifestations of symmetry breaking in the spectra of
collective excitations in finite quantum systems. The analysis of these
features allows for the better understanding of the intimate relation between
the type of symmetry and other physical properties of quantum systems. This
also makes it possible to predict new effects by employing the analogies
between finite quantum systems of different physical nature.

In this paper, we focus on the implementation of demand response strategy to

with centralized power control network to realize the real-time control
performance, where a single central controller measures the huge metering data
and sends control command back to all customers. For that purpose, we propose a
new architecture of hierarchical distributed power control network which is
scalable regardless of the network size. The sub-controllers are introduced to
partition the large system into smaller distributed clusters where low-latency
local feedback power control loops are conducted to guarantee control
stability. Furthermore, sub-controllers are stacked up in an hierarchical
manner such that data are fed back layer-by-layer in the inbound while in the
outbound control responses are decentralized in each local sub-controller for
realizing the global objectives. Numerical simulations in a realistic scenario
of up to 5000 consumers show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme to
achieve a desired 10% peak power saving by using off-the-shelf wireless devices
with IEEE802.15.4g standard. In addition, a small scale power control system
for green building test-bed is implemented to demonstrate the potential use of
the proposed scheme for power saving in real life.

$\mathrm{M}_{2}(R)$ has an involution, and under further mild assumptions, $R$
itself has an involution. In contrast to that, we demonstrate that (B) does not
imply (A). Our methods also give a new perspective on the
Knus-Parimala-Srinivas proof of Saltman's Theorem. Finally, we give a method to
test Azumaya algebras of exponent $2$ for the existence of involutions, and use

the main challenges that new-generation high-contrast spectro-imagers are going
to face. In a previous work we presented a long slit coronagraph (LSC), for
which the presence of a slit in the coronagraphic focal plane induces a complex
distribution of energy in the Lyot pupil-plane that cannot be easily masked
with a binary Lyot stop. To alleviate this concern, we propose to use a pupil
apodization to suppress diffraction, creating an apodized long slit coronagraph
(ALSC). After describing how the apodization is optimized, we demonstrate its
advantages with respect to the CLC in the context of SPHERE/IRDIS long slit
spectroscopy (LSS) mode at low-resolution with a 0.12"" slit and 0.18""
coronagraphic mask. We perform different sets of simulations with and without
aberrations, and with and without a slit to demonstrate that the apodization is
a more appropriate concept for LSS, at the expense of a significantly reduced
throughput (37%) compared to the LSC. Then we perform detailed end-to-end
simulations of the LSC and the ALSC that include realistic levels of
aberrations to obtain datasets representing 1h of integration time on stars of
spectral types A0 to M0 located at 10 pc. We insert spectra of planetary
companions at different effective temperatures (Teff) and surface gravities
(log g) into the data at angular separations of 0.3"" to 1.5"" and with contrast
ratios from 6 to 18 mag. Using the SD method to subtract the speckles, we show
that the ALSC brings a gain in sensitivity of up to 3 mag at 0.3"" with respect
to the LSC, which leads to a much better spectral extraction below 0.5"". In
terms of Teff, we demonstrate that at small angular separations the limit with
the ALSC is always lower by at least 100K, inducing an increase of sensitivity
of a factor up to 1.8 in objects' masses at young ages. [Abridged]

operation. They use an extreme adaptive optics (XAO) system to correct the
atmospheric turbulence and provide a highly-corrected beam to a near-infrared
(NIR) coronagraph for starlight suppression. The performance of the coronagraph
is however limited by the non-common path aberrations (NCPA) due to the
differential wavefront errors existing between the visible XAO sensing path and
the NIR science path, leading to residual speckles in the coronagraphic image.
Aims. Several approaches have been developed in the past few years to
accurately calibrate the NCPA, correct the quasi-static speckles and allow the
observation of exoplanets at least 1e6 fainter than their host star. We propose
an approach based on the Zernike phase-contrast method for the measurements of
the NCPA between the optical path seen by the visible XAO wavefront sensor and
that seen by the near-IR coronagraph. Methods. This approach uses a focal plane
phase mask of size {\lambda}/D, where {\lambda} and D denote the wavelength and
the telescope aperture diameter, respectively, to measure the quasi-static
aberrations in the upstream pupil plane by encoding them into intensity
variations in the downstream pupil image. We develop a rigorous formalism,
leading to highly accurate measurement of the NCPA, in a quasi-linear way
during the observation. Results. For a static phase map of standard deviation
44 nm rms at {\lambda} = 1.625 {\mu}m (0.026 {\lambda}), we estimate a possible
reduction of the chromatic NCPA by a factor ranging from 3 to 10 in the
presence of AO residuals compared with the expected performance of a typical
current-generation system. This would allow a reduction of the level of
quasi-static speckles in the detected images by a factor 10 to 100 hence,
correspondingly improving the capacity to observe exoplanets.

fact, we study mirror bipartite graphs from the point of view of their degree
sequences and of their degree sets. We characterize the sequences of degrees of
mirror bipartite graphs. We also show that from a given set P of positive
integers, we can construct a bipartite graph of order 2max P, which is mirror.
Furthermore, very little is known for the degree sequences of graphs with loops
attached, when the number of loops attached is limited. We show in this paper
that mirror bipartite graphs constitute a powerful tool to study the degree
sequences of these graphs when the number of loops attached at each vertex is
at most $1$.

  galaxy IC 310","9 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables. Accepted for publication in A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201321938",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context. The radio galaxy IC 310 has recently been identified as a gamma-ray
emitter based on observations at GeV energies with Fermi-LAT and at very high
energies (VHE, E>100GeV) with the MAGIC telescopes. Originally classified as a
head-tail radio galaxy, the nature of this object is subject of controversy
since its nucleus shows blazar-like behavior. Aims. In order to understand the
nature of IC 310 and the origin of the VHE emission we studied the spectral and
flux variability of IC 310 from the X-ray band to the VHE gamma-ray regime.
Methods. The light curve of IC 310 above 300GeV has been measured with the
MAGIC telescopes from Oct. 2009 to Feb. 2010. Fermi-LAT data (2008-2011) in the
10-500GeV energy range were also analyzed. In X-ray, archival observations from
2003 to 2007 with XMM, Chandra, and Swift-XRT in the 0.5-10keV band were
studied. Results. The VHE light curve reveals several high-amplitude and
short-duration flares. Day-to-day flux variability is clearly present. The
photon index between 120GeV and 8TeV remains at the value $\Gamma\sim2.0$
during both low and high flux states. The VHE spectral shape does not show
significant variability, whereas the flux at 1TeV changes by a factor of
$\sim7$. Fermi-LAT detected only eight gamma-ray events in the energy range
10GeV-500GeV in three years of observation. The measured photon index of
$\Gamma=1.3\pm0.5$ in the Fermi-LAT range is very hard. The X-ray measurements
show strong variability in flux and photon index. The latter varied from
$1.76\pm0.07$ to $2.55\pm0.07$. Conclusion. The rapid variability measured
confirms the blazar-like behavior of IC 310. The TeV emission seems to
originate from scales of less than 80 Schwarzschild radii within the compact
core of its FRI radio jet with orientation angle 10deg-38deg. The SED resembles
that of an extreme blazar, albeit the luminosity is more than two orders of
magnitude lower.

model of this event, basing on the a nonstationary accretion disk behavior,
connected with a high ellipticity of the orbital motion. The ephemeris used in
this paper -- JD$_{\rm opt-outb}$ = JD$_0$(2,444,944) $\pm$ n(111.0 $\pm$ 0.4)
days are derived from the orbital period of the system P$_{\rm orb} = 111.0 \pm
0.4$ days, determined by Priedhorsky & Terrell (1983), and from the optical
flare of December 5, 1981 (Giovannelli et al., 1985) (here after 811205-E; E
stands for the Event occurred at that date) that triggered the subsequent X-ray
outburst of December 13, 1981 (Nagase et al., 1982) (here after 811213-E). We
explain the observed time delay between the peaks of the optical and X-ray
outbursts in this system by the time of radial motion of the matter in the
accretion disk, after an increase of the mass flux in the vicinity of a
periastral point in the binary. This time is determined by the turbulent
viscosity, with the parameter $\alpha=0.1-0.3$. The increase of the mass flux
is a sort of flush that reaches the external part of the accretion disk around
the neutron star, producing an enhancement in the optical luminosity. The
consequent X-ray flare happens when the matter reaches the hot central parts of
the accretion disk, and the neutron star surface.

the Coma cluster, using optical images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope

axis of the host and are likely to have been formed by the accretion of a small
satellite galaxy. We have performed a detailed two-dimensional photometric
decomposition of NGC 4889 and of the many overlapping nearby galaxies in its
vicinity. This comprehensive model allows us not only to firmly detect the
low-surface brightness shells, but, crucially, also to accurately measure their
luminosities and colors. The shells are bluer than the underlying stars at the
same radius in the main galaxy. We make use of the colors of the shells and the
color-magnitude relation of the Coma cluster to infer the luminosity (or mass)
of the progenitor galaxy. The shells in NGC 4889 appear to have been produced
by the minor merger of a moderate-luminosity (M_I ~ -18.7 mag) disk (S0 or

probing the cosmic star formation history, although whether or not LGRB rates
are biased tracers of star formation rate history is highly debated. Based on
an extensive sample of LGRBs compiled by Robertson & Ellis (2012), we analyze
various models of star formation rate and the possible effect of the evolution
of cosmic metallicity under the assumption that LGRBs tend to occur in
low-metallicity galaxies. The models of star formation rate tested in this work
include empirical fits from observational data as well as a self-consistent
model calculated in the framework of the hierarchical structure formation.
Comparing with the observational data, we find a relatively higher metallicity
cut of $Z\gtrsim0.6Z_{\odot}$ for the empirical fits and no metallicity cut for
the self-consistent model. These results imply that there is no strong
metallicity preference for the host galaxy of LGRBs, in contrast to previous
work which suggest a cut of $Z\sim0.1-0.3Z_{\odot}$, and that the inferred
dependencies of LGRBs on their host galaxy properties are strongly related to
the specific models of star formation rate. Furthermore, a significant fraction
of LGRBs occur in small dark matter halos down to
$3\times10^{8}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ can provide an alternative explanation for
the discrepancy between the star formation rate history and LGRB rate history.

Reflectance, transmittance, and absorbance are carefully studied as a function

of resonances in the THz range, leading to higher wave transmittance due to the
reduced losses; on the other hand an increase of graphene chemical potential
up-shifts the frequency of plasmon resonances. It is also shown that a

observed up to scales $\simlt 1^{\ensuremath{^{\circ}}}$. Their interpretation
is challenging as even after removing the contribution from detected sources,
the residual signal is $>10$ times higher than expected from distant galaxies
below the detection limit and first stars. We propose here a novel
interpretation in which early, intermediate mass, accreting direct collapse
black holes (DCBH), which are too faint to be detected individually in current
surveys, could explain the observed fluctuations. We find that a population of
highly obscured ($N_{\rm H}\simgt 10^{25} \rm cm^{-2}$) DCBHs formed in
metal-free halos with virial temperature $10^4$ K at $z\simgt 12$, can explain
the observed level $\approx 10^{-3}$ (nW m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1})^2$ of the 3.6 and
4.5 $\mu$m fluctuations on scales $>100''$. The signal on smaller scales is
instead produced by undetected galaxies at low and intermediate redshifts.
Albeit Compton-thick, at scales $\theta> 100''$ DCBHs produce a CXB (0.5-2
keV)-NIRB ($4.5 \rm \mu m$) cross-correlation signal of $\simeq 10^{-11}$ erg
s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ nW m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ slightly dependent on the specific
value of the absorbing gas column ($N_{\rm H} \approx 10^{25} \rm cm^{-2}$)
adopted and in agreement with the recent measurements by
\cite{2012arXiv1210.5302C}. At smaller scales the cross-correlation is
dominated by the emission of high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXB) hosted by the same
low-$z$, undetected galaxies accounting for small scale NIRB fluctuations.
These results outline the great potential of the NIRB as a tool to investigate
the nature of the first galaxies and black holes.

fundamental transformation of the early Universe through the production of
ionizing photons and the initial enrichment with heavy chemical elements. We
here review the state of our knowledge, separating the well understood elements
of our emerging picture from those where more work is required. Primordial star
formation is unique in that its initial conditions can be directly inferred
from the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) model of cosmological structure
formation. Combined with gas cooling that is mediated via molecular hydrogen,
one can robustly identify the regions of primordial star formation, the
so-called minihalos, having total masses of ~10^6 M_sun and collapsing at
redshifts z~20-30. Within this framework, a number of studies have defined a
preliminary standard model, with the main result that the first stars were
predominantly massive. This model has recently been modified to include a
ubiquitous mode of fragmentation in the protostellar disks, such that the
typical outcome of primordial star formation may be the formation of a binary
or small multiple stellar system. We will also discuss extensions to this
standard picture due to the presence of dynamically significant magnetic
fields, of heating from self-annihalating WIMP dark matter, or cosmic rays. We
conclude by discussing possible strategies to empirically test our theoretical
models.

3D scene from any freely chosen viewpoint. An intermediate virtual viewpoint
image is commonly synthesized using two pairs of transmitted texture and depth
maps from two neighboring captured viewpoints via depth-image-based rendering
(DIBR). To maintain high quality of synthesized images, it is imperative to
contain the adverse effects of network packet losses that may arise during
texture and depth video transmission. Towards this end, we develop an
integrated approach that exploits the representation redundancy inherent in the
multiple streamed videos a voxel in the 3D scene visible to two captured views
is sampled and coded twice in the two views. In particular, at the receiver we
first develop an error concealment strategy that adaptively blends
corresponding pixels in the two captured views during DIBR, so that pixels from
the more reliable transmitted view are weighted more heavily. We then couple it
with a sender-side optimization of reference picture selection (RPS) during
real-time video coding, so that blocks containing samples of voxels that are
visible in both views are more error-resiliently coded in one view only, given
adaptive blending will erase errors in the other view. Further, synthesized
view distortion sensitivities to texture versus depth errors are analyzed, so
that relative importance of texture and depth code blocks can be computed for
system-wide RPS optimization. Experimental results show that the proposed
scheme can outperform the use of a traditional feedback channel by up to 0.82
dB on average at 8% packet loss rate, and by as much as 3 dB for particular
frames.

interpretation of these solutions proposed earlier by Schroedinger. This new
alternative was refused by Einstein on the basis of the EPR Gedankenexperiment,
but accepted fully for microscopic reality by scientific community. Both the
quantum alternatives were discussed, however, again later. Bell tried to find a
possibility how to decide between them; he generalized Einstein's
Gedankenexperiment assuming that also spins of two detected particles would be
measured. He derived then some inequality for a special combination of four
coincidence probabilities, and it was commonly assumed that his inequality held
for the original Schroedinger interpretation but not in Bohr's Copenhagen
quantum mechanics; without any actual proof having been given. Corresponding
experiments were proposed and finished in 1982. The violation of Bell's
inequality was then interpreted as decisive victory of Bohr's theory. However,
it will be shown that Bell's inequality has been interpreted mistakenly. It has
been based always on some assumption that does not hold in any probabilistic
theory (i.e., in the given spin experiment) but only in deterministic classical
theory. There is not any argument for preferring the Copenhagen quantum

  Low Sensitivity","This paper has been withdrawn by the author(s) due to a crucial error
  in equations 12, and errors in Table III",,,,"physics.ins-det","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a novel design procedure for wideband microstrip bandpass
filters with non-equiripple filtering frequency responses and low sensitivity.
Different from the traditional Chebyshev transfer function filters, the return
loss zeros of the proposed non-equiripple filters can be redistributed within
the operating passband. For the industrial applications, the proposed filters
have a reduced sensitivity to manufacturing errors and exhibit good tolerance
control for both specified bandwidth and maximum in-band reflection loss. By
deriving the transfer functions, a synthesis approach with a set of non-linear
equations can be established according to the specifications such as the
bandwidth and predetermined reflection lobes. Without performing any post
optimization in the full-wave simulation, the non-equiripple synthesized
results have less sensitivity and fractional bandwidth (delta) error in
comparison with those obtained from traditional Chebyshev transfer functions
with equiripple frequency responses. As design examples, a four-pole bandpass
filter with delta=60% and a five-pole bandpass filter with delta=82.5% are
designed and fabricated. Measured results show a good agreement with those
obtained from the prediction, without any tuning or adjustments.

inequivalent on the level of thermodynamics.

  arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1212.1711",,"10.1007/s10509-013-1500-8",,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Degeneracy effects for bosons are more important for smaller particle mass,
smaller temperature and higher number density. Bose condensation requires that
particles be in the same lowest energy quantum state. We propose a cosmic
background Bose condensation, present everywhere, whith its particles having
the lowest quantum energy state, $\hbar c / \lambda$, with $\lambda$ about the
size of the visible universe, and therefore unlocalized. This we identify with
the quantum of the self gravitational potential energy of any particle, and
with the bit of information of minimum energy. The entropy of the universe
($\sim 10^{122} \ bits$) has the highest number density ($ \sim 10^{36} \ bits
/ cm^3$) of particles inside the visible universe, the smallest mass, $\sim
10^{-66} g$, and the smallest temperature, $\sim 10^{-29} K$. Therefore it is
the best candidate for a Cosmic Background Bose Condensation (CBBC), a
completely calmed fluid, with no viscosity, in a superfluidity state, and
possibly responsible for the expansion of the universe.

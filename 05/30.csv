we show how to engineer the environment in order to dissipatively prepare the
mechanical oscillator in a superposition of Fock states with fidelity close to
one. Furthermore, we discuss how a single atom in a cavity with several
mechanical oscillators can be exploited to realize nonlinear many-body physics
by stroboscopically driving the mechanical oscillators. We show how to prepare
non-classical many-body states by either applying coherent protocols or
engineering dissipation. The analysis of the protocols is carried out using a
perturbation theory for degenerate Liouvillians and numerical tools. Our
results apply to other systems where a qubit is coupled to a mechanical
oscillator via a bosonic mode, e.g., in cavity quantum electromechanics.

simulation tools with a universal approach are rare. Usually, simulators are

PARSPIN, the subject of this thesis. In medical applications, the Bloch
equation is a well-suited mathematical model of the underlying physics with a
wide scope. In this thesis, it is shown how analytical solutions of the Bloch
equation can be found, which promise substantial execution time advantages over
numerical solution methods. From these analytical solutions of the Bloch
equation, a new formalism for the description and the analysis of complex
imaging experiments is derived, the K-t formalism. It is shown that modern
imaging methods can be better explained by the K-t formalism than by observing
and analysing the magnetization of each spin of a spin ensemble. Various
approaches for a numerical simulation of Magnetic Resonance imaging are
discussed. It is shown that a simulation tool based on the K-t formalism
promises a substantial gain in execution time. Proper spatial discretization
according to the sampling theorem, a topic rarely discussed in literature, is
universally derived from the K-t formalism in this thesis. A spin-based
simulator is an application with high demands to computing facilities even on
modern hardware. In this thesis, two approaches for a parallelized software
architecture are designed, analysed and evaluated with regard to a reduction of
execution time. A number of possible applications in research and education are
demonstrated. For a choice of imaging experiments, results produced both

develop a model which captures modern characteristics such as constrained I/O

systems, we use blocking probability as the quality of service metric and
propose the network coded storage (NCS) scheme as a way to reduce blocking

striping and file duplication. Under our assumptions, we illustrate cases where
SR NCS provides an order of magnitude savings in blocking probability. For MR
systems, we introduce saturation probability as a quality of service metric to
manage multiple user types, and we propose the uncoded resolution- aware

reduce saturation probability. In MR URS, we align our MR layout strategy with
traffic requirements. In MR CRS, we code videos across MR layers. Under our

type testing conditions to characterise the $L^{2}$ boundedness. Second, we
completely answer the question, whether the boundedness of our operators on
$L^{2}$ implies boundedness on other $L^{p}$ spaces, including the endpoints.
For the conical square function, the answers are generally affirmative, but the
vertical square function can be unbounded on $L^{p}$ for $p > 2$, even if $\mu

algebra cohomology of p-nilpotent Lie algebras with trivial p-power operation.
Our study is facilitated by a spectral sequence whose $E_{2}$-term is the
tensor product of the symmetric algebra on the dual of the Lie algebra with the
ordinary Lie algebra cohomology and converges to the restricted cohomology
ring. In many cases this spectral sequence collapses, and thus, the restricted
Lie algebra cohomology is Cohen-Macaulay. A stronger result involves the
collapsing of the spectral sequence and the cohomology ring identifying as ring
with the $E_{2}$-term. We present criteria for the collapsing of this spectral
sequence and provide many examples where the ring isomorphism fails.
Furthermore, we show that there are instances when the spectral sequence does
not collapse and yields cohomology rings which are not Cohen-Macaulay.

the underlying microscopic processes and information about the complexity of
the quantum states, which is related to the efficiency of simulations on
classical computers. Recently, experiments with trapped ions, polar molecules,
and Rydberg excitations have provided new opportunities to observe dynamics
with long-range interactions. We explore nonequilibrium coherent dynamics after
a quantum quench in such systems, identifying qualitatively different behavior
as the exponent of algebraically decaying spin-spin interactions in a
transverse Ising chain is varied. Computing the build-up of bipartite
entanglement as well as mutual information between distant spins, we identify
linear growth of entanglement entropy corresponding to propagation of
quasiparticles for shorter range interactions, with the maximum rate of growth
occurring when the Hamiltonian parameters match those for the quantum phase
transition. Counter-intuitively, the growth of bipartite entanglement for
long-range interactions is only logarithmic for most regimes, i.e.,
substantially slower than for shorter range interactions. Experiments with
trapped ions allow for the realization of this system with a tunable
interaction range, and we show that the different phenomena are robust for
finite system sizes and in the presence of noise. These results can act as a
direct guide for the generation of large-scale entanglement in such
experiments, towards a regime where the entanglement growth can render existing
classical simulations inefficient.

obtain a large class of exact solutions, which are in general time-dependent
and non-axisymmetric. These solutions include waves that, surprisingly,
propagate without scattering on the curvature of the black hole's background.
They may be understood as generalizations to Robinson's solutions to vacuum
electrodynamics associated with a shear-free congruence of null geodesics. When
stationary and axisymmetric, our solutions reduce to those of Menon and Dermer,
the only previously known solutions in Kerr. In Kerr, all of our solutions have
null electromagnetic fields ($\vec{E} \cdot \vec{B} = 0$ and $E^2=B^2$).
However, in Schwarzschild or flat spacetime there is freedom to add a magnetic
monopole field, making the solutions magnetically dominated ($B^2>E^2$). This
freedom may be used to reproduce the various flat-spacetime and
Schwarzschild-spacetime (split) monopole solutions available in the literature
(due to Michel and later authors), and to obtain a large class of
time-dependent, non-axisymmetric generalizations. These generalizations may be
used to model the magnetosphere of a conducting star that rotates with
arbitrary prescribed time-dependent rotation axis and speed. We thus
significantly enlarge the class of known exact solutions, while organizing and

($\Delta = 0.435$ \AA \,at $\delta = - 5.25$%). A tensile strain of 2.91% turns
the direct band gap of ML-ZnS into indirect. Within our considered strain
values of $|\delta| < 6%$, the band gap shows linearly decreasing (non-linearly
increasing as well as decreasing) variation with tensile (compressive) strain.

3sigma limits correspond to a dust mass of 1.2 MEarth in Taurus and a mere 0.2
MEarth in the TWA (3--10x deeper than previous work). We combine our data with
other sub-mm/mm surveys of Taurus, rho Oph and the TWA to investigate trends in
disk mass and grain growth during the cTT phase. We find : (1) The minimum disk
outer radius required to explain the upper envelope of sub-mm/mm fluxes is 100
AU for intermediate-mass stars, solar-types and VLMS, and 20 AU for BDs. (2)
While the upper envelope of disk masses increases with Mstar from BDs to VLMS
to solar-types, no increase is seen from solar-type to intermediate-mass stars.
We propose this is due to enhanced photoevaporation around intermediate masses.
(3) Many disks around Taurus and rho Oph intermediate-mass and solar-type stars
evince an opacity index beta of 0--1, indicating large grains. Of the only four
VLMS/BDs in these regions with multi-wavelength data, three are consistent with
large grains, though optically thick disks are not ruled out. (4) For the TWA
VLMS (TWA 30A, B), combining our fluxes with Mdot and ages suggests substantial
grain growth by 10 Myr. The degree of grain growth in the TWA BDs (2M1207A,
SSPM1102) remains largely unknown. (5) A Bayesian analysis shows that
mean(log[Mdisk/Mstar]) = -2.4, roughly constant all the way from
intermediate-mass stars to VLMS/BDs, and (6) the disk mass in close solar-type
Taurus binaries is significantly lower than in singles (by a factor of 10),
while that in wide solar-type Taurus binaries is closer to that in singles
(lower by a factor of 3). (7) We discuss the implications for planet formation,

early time optical and gamma-ray detections. From these GRBs, we extract a
sub-sample of 18 GRBs, which show optical peaks during prompt gamma-ray
emission, and perform detailed temporal and spectral analysis in gamma-ray,
X-ray, and optical bands. We find that in most cases early time optical
emission shows sharp and steep behaviour, and notice a rich diversity of
spectral properties. Using a simple internal shock dissipation model, we show
that the emission during prompt GRB phase can occur at very different
frequencies via synchrotron radiation. Based on the results obtained from
observations and simulation, we conclude that the standard external shock
interpretation for early time optical emission is disfavoured in most cases due
to sharp peaks ($\Delta t/t < 1$) and steep rise/decay indices, and that

appropriate emergence conjecture is formulated. Accordingly, it might be
expected that only global symmetries are fundamental symmetries of Nature,
whereas local symmetries and associated massless gauge fields could solely
emerge due to spontaneous breaking of underlying spacetime symmetries involved,
such as relativistic invariance and supersymmetry. We further argue that this
breaking, taken in the form of the nonlinear sigma-model type pattern for
vector fields or superfields, puts essential restrictions on geometrical
degrees of freedom of a physical field system that makes it to adjust itself in
such a way that its global internal symmetry G turns into the local symmetry
G_{loc}. Remarkably, this emergence process may naturally be triggered by
supersymmetry, as is illustrated in detail by an example of a general
supersymmetric QED model which is then extended to the Standard Model and GUTs.
The requirement of vacuum stability in such class of models makes both Lorentz
invariance and supersymmetry to become spontaneously broken in the visible
sector. As a consequence, massless photon and other gauge bosons appear as the
corresponding Goldstone and pseudo-Goldstone zero modes and special local
invariance is simultaneously generated. Due to this invariance all possible
Lorentz violations are turned out to be completely cancelled out among
themselves. However, broken supersymmetry effects related to an existence of a
light pseudo-goldstino (being essentially a photino) are still left in the
theory. It typically appears in the low-energy particle spectrum as the eV
scale stable LSP or the electroweak scale long-lived NLSP, being in both cases
accompanied by a very light gravitino, that could be considered as some
observational signature in favor of emergent supersymmetric theories.

reconnection, which forms and heats flare loops. Recent studies have revealed a
two-phase evolution pattern of UV 1600\AA\ emission at the feet of these loops:
a rapid pulse lasting for a few seconds to a few minutes, followed by a gradual
decay on timescales of a few tens of minutes. Multiple band EUV observations by
AIA further reveal very similar signatures. These two phases represent
different but related signatures of an impulsive energy release in the corona.
The rapid pulse is an immediate response of the lower atmosphere to an intense
thermal conduction flux resulting from the sudden heating of the corona to high
temperatures (we rule out energetic particles due to a lack of significant hard
X-ray emission). The gradual phase is associated with the cooling of hot plasma
that has been evaporated into the corona. The observed footpoint emission is
again powered by thermal conduction (and enthalpy), but now during a period
when approximate steady state conditions are established in the loop. UV and
EUV light curves of individual pixels may therefore be separated into
contributions from two distinct physical mechanisms to shed light on the nature
of energy transport in a flare. We demonstrate this technique using
coordinated, spatially resolved observations of UV and EUV emission from the

set of fermionic mode functions obeying a general quasiperiodicity condition
along the compactified dimension. The vacuum expectation value of the azimuthal
current density is decomposed into two parts. The first one corresponds to the
uncompactified cosmic string geometry and the second one is the correction
induced by the compactification. For the first part we provide a closed
expression which includes various special cases previously discussed in the
literature. The second part is an odd periodic function of the magnetic flux
along the string axis with the period equal to the flux quantum and it is an
even function of the magnetic flux enclosed by the string axis. The
compactification of the cosmic string axis in combination with the
quasiperiodicity condition leads to the nonzero axial current density. The
latter is an even periodic function of the magnetic flux along the string axis
and an odd periodic function of the magnetic flux enclosed by the string axis.
The axial current density vanishes for untwisted and twisted fields in the
absence of the magnetic flux enclosed by the string axis. The asymptotic
behavior of the vacuum fermionic current is investigated near the string and at
large distances from it. In particular, the topological part of the azimuthal

protostellar jets in the Carina nebula: HH666, HH901, HH902, and HH1066. These
massive jets are unusual because they are bathed in UV radiation from dozens of
nearby O stars, but despite the strong incident ionizing radiation, portions of
the jet remain neutral. Near-IR [Fe II] images reveal dense, neutral gas that
was not seen in previous studies of H-alpha emission. We show that near-IR [Fe
II] emitting gas must be self-shielded from Lyman continuum photons, regardless
of its excitation mechanism (shocks, FUV radiation, or both). High densities
are required for the survival of Fe+ amid the strong Lyman continuum from Tr14,
raising estimates of the mass-loss rates by an order of magnitude. Higher jet
mass-loss rates require higher accretion rates onto their driving protostars,
implying that these jets are driven by intermediate-mass (IM; ~2-8 Msun) stars.
Indeed, the IR driving sources of two of these outflows have luminosities that
require IM protostars. All four of these HH jets are highly collimated, with
opening angles of only a few degrees, similar to those observed in low-mass
protostars. We propose that these jets reflect essentially the same outflow
phenomenon seen in wide-angle molecular outflows associated with IM and
high-mass protostars, but that the collimated atomic jet core is irradiated and
rendered observable in Carina's harsh radiative environment. In more quiescent
environments, this atomic core remains invisible, and outflows traced by
shock-excited molecules in the outflow cavity give the impression that these
outflows have a wider opening angle. Thus, the externally irradiated jets in
Carina constitute a new view of collimated jets from IM protostars, and offer
strong additional evidence that stars up to at least ~8 Msun form by the same
accretion mechanisms as low-mass stars.

deformable, connected, and articulated objects, intra- and inter-object
occlusions, object motion, and poor lighting. Some of these challenges call for
object models that can locate a desired object and separate it from its
surrounding background, even when both share similar colors and textures. In
this work, we extend a fuzzy object model, named cloud system model (CSM), to
handle video segmentation, and evaluate it for body pose estimation of toddlers
at risk of autism. CSM has been successfully used to model the parts of the
brain (cerebrum, left and right brain hemispheres, and cerebellum) in order to
automatically locate and separate them from each other, the connected brain
stem, and the background in 3D MR-images. In our case, the objects are
articulated parts (2D projections) of the human body, which can deform, cause
self-occlusions, and move along the video. The proposed CSM extension handles
articulation by connecting the individual clouds, body parts, of the system
using a 2D stickman model. The stickman representation naturally allows us to
extract 2D body pose measures of arm asymmetry patterns during unsupported gait
of toddlers, a possible behavioral marker of autism. The results show that our
method can provide insightful knowledge to assist the specialist's observations

escape velocities from the host galaxies. The line-of-sight velocity dispersion
declines slightly toward outer parts of the nebulae (by 3% per kpc on average).
The majority of nebulae show blueshifted excesses in their line profiles across
most of their extents, signifying gas outflows. For the median outflow

volume, we find that the chance of contamination increases systematically with
the level of zoom. In order to avoid contamination, the Lagrangian volume
selected for resimulation must increase monotonically with the resolution
difference between parent box and the zoom region. We provide a simple formula
for selecting Lagrangian regions (in units of the halo virial volume) as a
function of the level of zoom required. We also explore the degree to which a
halo's Lagrangian volume correlates with other halo properties (concentration,
spin, formation time, shape, etc.) and find no significant correlation. There
is a mild correlation between Lagrange volume and environment, such that halos
living in the most clustered regions have larger Lagrangian volumes.
Nevertheless, selecting halos to be isolated is not the best way to ensure
inexpensive zoom simulations. We explain how one can safely choose halos with
the smallest Lagrangian volumes, which are the least expensive to resimulate,
without biasing one's sample.

at a redshift of z_L = 0.5 and explore the radial dependence of the resulting
magnification bias and its variability with the velocity dispersion of the
lens, the photometric sensitivity of the instrument, the redshift of the
background source population, and the intrinsic maximum absolute magnitude
(M_{max}) of the sources. We find that gravitational lensing enhances the
number of galaxies with redshifts z >= 13 detected in the angular region
\theta_E/2 <= \theta <= 2\theta_E (where \theta_E is the Einstein angle) by a
factor of ~ 3 and 1.5 in the HUDF (df/d\nu_0 ~ 9 nJy) and medium-deep JWST
surveys (df/d\nu_0 ~ 6 nJy). Furthermore, we find that even in cases where a
negative magnification bias reduces the observed number count of background
sources, the lensing effect improves the sensitivity of the count to the
intrinsic faint-magnitude cut-off of the Schechter luminosity function. In a
field centered on a strong lensing cluster, observations of z >= 6 and z >= 13
galaxies with JWST can be used to infer this cut-off magnitude for values as
faint as M_{max} ~ -14.4 and -16.1 mag (L_{min} ~ 2.5*10^{26} and 1.2*10^{27}

yield converging shock waves that are strong enough to ignite C detonations in
high-mass C/O cores, with the caveat that a truly robust answer requires
multi-dimensional detonation initiation calculations. We also find that
convergence-driven detonations in low-mass C/O cores and in O/Ne cores are
harder to achieve and are perhaps unrealized in standard binary evolution.

as input to a seasonally varying, 1-D energy-balance climate model. A
three-dimensional general circulation model is also used to explore the
atmosphere's response to changes in incoming stellar radiation, or
instellation, and surface albedo. Using this hierarchy of models we simulate
planets covered by ocean, land, and water ice of varying grain size, with
incident radiation from stars of different spectral types. Terrestrial planets
orbiting stars with higher near-UV radiation exhibit a stronger ice-albedo
feedback. We find that ice-covered conditions occur on an F-dwarf planet with
only a 2% reduction in instellation relative to the present instellation on
Earth, assuming fixed CO2 (present atmospheric level on Earth). A similar
planet orbiting the Sun at an equivalent flux distance requires an 8% reduction
in instellation, while a planet orbiting an M-dwarf star requires an additional
19% reduction in instellation to become ice-covered, equivalent to 73% of the
modern solar constant. The surface ice-albedo feedback effect becomes less
important at the outer edge of the habitable zone, where atmospheric CO2 can be
expected to be high in order to maintain clement conditions for surface liquid
water. We show that 3-10 bars of CO2 will entirely mask the climatic effect of
ice and snow, leaving the outer limits of the habitable zone unaffected by the
spectral dependence of water ice and snow albedo. However, less CO2 is needed
to maintain open water for a planet orbiting an M-dwarf star, than would be the
case for hotter main-sequence stars.

when calculated relative to large field-galaxy spiral samples. The observed
offsets are consistent with a simple star formation model in which S0s are
identical to spirals until abrupt quenching occurs at some intermediate
redshift. The offsets form a continuous distribution tracing the time since the
cessation of star formation, and exhibit a strong correlation (>6{\sigma}) with
residuals from the optical colour-magnitude relation. Typically, S0s which are
fainter than average for their rotational velocity are also redder than average
for their luminosity. The S0 TFR offset is also correlated with both the

effective field theory (EFT) which describes the post-Newtonian (PN) inspiral
of two gravitating bodies by (re)formulating several parts of the theory. Novel
ingredients include gauge invariant spherical fields in the radiation zone; a
system zone which preserves time reversal such that its violation arises not
from local odd propagation but rather from interaction with the radiation
sector in a way which resembles the balayage method; 2-way multipoles to
perform zone matching within the EFT action; and a double-field
radiation-reaction action which is the non-quantum version of the Closed Time
Path formalism and generalizes to any theory with directed propagators
including theories which are defined by equations of motion rather than an
action. This formulation unifies the treatment of outgoing radiation and its
reaction force. We demonstrate the theory in the scalar, electromagnetic and
gravitational cases by economizing the following: the expression for the
radiation source multipoles; the derivation of the leading outgoing radiation
and associated reaction force such that it is maximally reduced to mere
multiplication; and the derivation of the gravitational next to leading PN
order. In fact we present a novel expression for the +1PN correction to all
mass multipoles. We introduce useful definitions for multi-index summation, for
the normalization of Bessel functions and for the normalization of the
gravito-magnetic vector potential.

reflect low star-formation activity. We demonstrate that these galaxies as an
ensemble are dust-poor and transparent and therefore likely have smooth light

present-day counterparts, the z>1 early-type galaxies show a variety of
intrinsic shapes; even at a fixed mass, the projected axis ratio distributions
cannot be explained by the random projection of a set of galaxies with very
similar intrinsic shapes. However, a two-population model for the intrinsic
shapes, consisting of a triaxial, fairly round population, combined with a flat
(c/a~0.3) oblate population, adequately describes the projected axis ratio
distributions of both present-day and z>1 early-type galaxies. We find that the
proportion of oblate versus triaxial galaxies depends both on the galaxies'
stellar mass, and - at a given mass - on redshift. For present-day and z<1
early-type galaxies the oblate fraction strongly depends on galaxy mass. At z>1
this trend is much weaker over the mass range explored here
(10^10<M*/M_sun<10^11), because the oblate fraction among massive (M*~10^11

demonstrated to be sourced by a line emanating infinitesimally close to the

orthogonally through the de Sitter hyperboloids of all finite sizes. This

zero mode solution to an ordinary differential equation, the ""wave equation""

eigenstate of an initial Hamiltonian $\hat{H}_I$ and it evolves according to a
different final Hamiltonian $\hat{H}_F$. If the initial state has a chaotic
structure with respect to $\hat{H}_F$, i.e., if it fills the energy shell
ergodically, thermalization is certain to occur. This happens when $\hat{H}_I$
is a full random matrix, because its states projected onto $\hat{H}_F$ are
fully delocalized. The results for the observables then agree with those
obtained with thermal states at infinite temperature. However, finite real
systems with few-body interactions, as the ones considered here, are deprived
of fully extended eigenstates, even when described by a nonintegrable
Hamiltonian. We examine how the initial state delocalizes as it gets closer to
the middle of the spectrum of $\hat{H}_F$, causing the observables to approach
thermal averages, be the models integrable or chaotic. Our numerical studies
are based on initial states with energies that cover the entire lower half of
the spectrum of one-dimensional Heisenberg spin-1/2 systems.

strains. This increase can be attributed to a change of character of the lowest
mode resulting from different relative couplings of the various polar modes to
epitaxial strain. Finally, spin-phonon coupling strengths are computed in a
Heisenberg formalism. This analysis directly reveals the changes in exchange
couplings due to specific atomic displacements or phonon modes, as well as the

lenses to characterize what is important and universal in mathematics---with
adjunctions being the primary lense. If adjunctions are so important in
mathematics, then perhaps they will isolate concepts of some importance in the
empirical sciences. But the applications of adjunctions have been hampered by
an overly restrictive formulation that avoids heteromorphisms or hets. By
reformulating an adjunction using hets, it is split into two parts, a left and
a right semiadjunction (or half-adjunuction). Semiadjunctions (essentially a
formulation of a universal mapping property using hets) turn out to be the
appropriate concept for applications in the life sciences. The semiadjunctions
characterize three principal schemes with applications: 1. determination
through a receiving universal (e.g., natural selection, perception, language
acquisition, recursion, and language understanding); 2. determination through a
sending universal (e.g., intentional action, DNA mechanism to build amino
acids, hierarchy of regulatory genes to build organs, stem cells, and language
production), and 3. two-way determination with one universal as both receiving
and sending (e.g., perception/action and language understanding/production).

involving scalars are not suppressed by powers of Planck mass. Since gravity
couples anything with mass to anything with mass, then Higgs must be strongly
coupled to any other fundamental scalar in nature, even if the gauge couplings
are absent in the original Lagrangian. Since the LHC data indicate that the
Higgs is very much standard model-like, there is very little room for
non-standard model processes, e.g. invisible decays. This severely complicates
any model that involves light enough scalar that the Higgs can kinematically
decay to. Most notably, these are the quintessence models, models including
light axions, and light scalar dark matter models.

preventing them from forming stars or expelling heavy elements into the IGM

these halos began to rapidly cool by atomic lines, perhaps forming 10^4 - 10^6

modeled the explosion of a supermassive Pop III star in the dense core of a
line-cooled protogalaxy with the ZEUS-MP code. We find that the supernova (SN)
expands to a radius of ~ 1 kpc, briefly engulfing the entire galaxy, but then
collapses back into the potential well of the dark matter. Fallback fully mixes
the interior of the protogalaxy with metals, igniting a violent starburst and
fueling the rapid growth of a massive black hole at its center. The starburst
would populate the protogalaxy with stars in greater numbers and at higher
metallicities than in more slowly-evolving, nearby halos. The SN remnant
becomes a strong synchrotron source that can be observed with eVLA and eMERLIN

generated a significant interest in the deployment of incentive mechanisms to
reduce peak-time congestion. Typically, the design of these mechanisms requires
information about user demand and sensitivity to prices. Such information is
naturally imperfect. In this paper, we propose a \emph{fixed-budget rebate
mechanism} that gives each user a reward proportional to his percentage
contribution to the aggregate reduction in peak time demand. For comparison, we
also study a time-of-day pricing mechanism that gives each user a fixed reward
per unit reduction of his peak-time demand. To evaluate the two mechanisms, we
introduce a game-theoretic model that captures the \emph{public good} nature of
decongestion. For each mechanism, we demonstrate that the socially optimal
level of decongestion is achievable for a specific choice of the mechanism's
parameter. We then investigate how imperfect information about user demand
affects the mechanisms' effectiveness. From our results, the fixed-budget
rebate pricing is more robust when the users' sensitivity to congestion is
""sufficiently"" convex. This feature of the fixed-budget rebate mechanism is
attractive for many situations of interest and is driven by its closed-loop
property, i.e., the unit reward decreases as the peak-time demand decreases.

for quantum information. A three-dimensional gapped lattice spin model is found
which demonstrates for the first time that a reliable quantum memory at finite
temperature is possible, at least to some extent. When quantum information is
encoded into a highly entangled ground state of this model and subjected to
thermal errors, the errors remain easily correctable for a long time without
any active intervention, because a macroscopic energy barrier keeps the errors
well localized. As a result, stored quantum information can be retrieved
faithfully for a memory time which grows exponentially with the square of the
inverse temperature. In contrast, for previously known types of topological
quantum storage in three or fewer spatial dimensions the memory time scales
exponentially with the inverse temperature, rather than its square.
  This spin model exhibits a previously unexpected topological quantum order,
in which ground states are locally indistinguishable, pointlike excitations are
immobile, and the immobility is not affected by small perturbations of the
Hamiltonian. The degeneracy of the ground state, though also insensitive to
perturbations, is a complicated number-theoretic function of the system size,
and the system bifurcates into multiple noninteracting copies of itself under
real-space renormalization group transformations. The degeneracy, the
excitations, and the renormalization group flow can be analyzed using a
framework that exploits the spin model's symmetry and some associated free
resolutions of modules over polynomial algebras.

associated with group formation. One of the benefits is collective memory. In
groups on the move, social interactions play a crucial role in the cohesion and
the ability to make consensus decisions. When migrating from spawning to
feeding areas fish schools need to retain a collective memory of the
destination site over thousand of kilometers and changes in group formation or
individual preference can produce sudden changes in migration pathways. We
propose a modelling framework, based on stochastic adaptive networks, that can
reproduce this collective behaviour. We assume that three factors control group
formation and school migration behaviour: the intensity of social interaction,
the relative number of informed individuals and the preference that each
individual has for the particular migration area. We treat these factors
independently and relate the individuals' preferences to the experience and
memory for certain migration sites. We demonstrate that removal of knowledgable
individuals or alteration of individual preference can produce rapid changes in
group formation and collective behavior. For example, intensive fishing
targeting the migratory species and also their preferred prey can reduce both
terms to a point at which migration to the destination sites is suddenly
stopped. The conceptual approaches represented by our modelling framework may
therefore be able to explain large-scale changes in fish migration and spatial
distribution.

in an homogeneous plasma region encounters an inhomogeneity, it can resonantly
excite long wavelength whistler waves via a linear mechanism known as mode
conversion. An enhancement of lower hybrid/whistler activity has been often
observed by sounding rockets and satellites in the presence of density
depletions (striations) in the upper ionosphere. We address here the process of
linear mode conversion of lower hybrid to whistler waves, mediated by a density
striation, using a scalar-field formalism (in the limit of cold plasma linear

effectively transfer a large amount of energy from the short to the long
wavelength modes. We also study how the efficiency scales by changing the
properties (width and amplitude) of the density striation. We present a general
criterion for the width of the striation that, if fulfilled, maximizes the
conversion efficiency. Such a criterion could provide an interpretation of
recent laboratory experiments carried out on the Large Plasma Device at UCLA.

experiments; the goal is to estimate the `average treatment effect' of a new
feature or condition by exposing a sample of the overall population to it. A
drawback with A/B testing is that it is poorly suited for experiments involving
social interference, when the treatment of individuals spills over to
neighboring individuals along an underlying social network. In this work, we
propose a novel methodology using graph clustering to analyze average treatment
effects under social interference. To begin, we characterize graph-theoretic
conditions under which individuals can be considered to be `network exposed' to
an experiment. We then show how graph cluster randomization admits an efficient
exact algorithm to compute the probabilities for each vertex being network
exposed under several of these exposure conditions. Using these probabilities
as inverse weights, a Horvitz-Thompson estimator can then provide an effect
estimate that is unbiased, provided that the exposure model has been properly
specified.
  Given an estimator that is unbiased, we focus on minimizing the variance.
First, we develop simple sufficient conditions for the variance of the
estimator to be asymptotically small in n, the size of the graph. However, for
general randomization schemes, this variance can be lower bounded by an
exponential function of the degrees of a graph. In contrast, we show that if a
graph satisfies a restricted-growth condition on the growth rate of
neighborhoods, then there exists a natural clustering algorithm, based on
vertex neighborhoods, for which the variance of the estimator can be upper
bounded by a linear function of the degrees. Thus we show that proper cluster
randomization can lead to exponentially lower estimator variance when
experimentally measuring average treatment effects under interference.

and the spatial evolution of dimming regions at high temporal and spatial
cadence from the time of their appearance to their disappearance. We use the
Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly 193 A wavelength
observations and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager to study dimmings. As a
demonstration of the detection technique we analyzed six recurrences of a
dimming observed near AR 11305 between 2011 September 29 and October 2. The
dimming repeatedly ap- peared and formed in a similar way, first expanding then
shrinking and occasionally stabilizing in the same location until the next
eruption. The dimming areas were studied in conjunction with the corre-
sponding flare magnitudes and coronal mass ejection (CME) masses. These
properties were found to follow a similar trend during the observation period,
which is consistent with the idea that the mag- nitude of the eruption and the
CME mass affect the relative sizes of the consecutive dimmings. We also present
a hypothesis to explain the evolution of the recurrent single dimming through
interchange reconnection. This process would accommodate the relocation of
quasi-open magnetic field lines and hence allow the CME flux rope footpoint
(the dimming) to expand into quiet Sun regions. By relating the properties of
dimmings, flares, and CMEs we improve our understanding of the magnetic field
reconfiguration caused by reconnection.

quantum chemical algorithms to reduce computational scaling and memory overhead
requires a contrasting algorithmic philosophy, but one which when implemented
efficiently can often achieve higher accuracy/cost ratios with small random

parallelization which hinders the progress of deterministic high-level quantum

portion (38%) of massive early-type galaxies in heavy clusters show strong
merger-related disturbed features. This contradicts the general understanding
that massive clusters are hostile environments for galaxy mergers. Considering
the significance of mergers in galaxy evolution, it is important to understand
this. Aims. We aim to present a theoretical foundation that explains galaxy
mergers in massive clusters. Methods. We used the N-body simulation technique
to perform a cosmological-volume simulation and derive dark-halo merger trees.
Then, we used the semi-analytic modeling technique to populate each halo with
galaxies. We ran hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy mergers to estimate the
lifetime of merger features for the imaging condition used by Sheen and
collaborators. We applied this merger feature lifetime to our semi-analytic
models. Finally, we counted the massive early-type galaxies in heavy model
clusters that would show strong merger features. Results. While there still are
substantial uncertainties, our preliminary results are remarkably close to the
observed fraction of galaxies with merger features. Key ingredients for the
success are twofold: firstly, the subhalo motion in dark haloes has been
accurately traced, and, second, the lifetime of merger features has been
properly estimated. As a result, merger features are expected to last very long
in cluster environments. Many massive early-type galaxies in heavy clusters
therefore show merger features not because they experience mergers in the
current clusters in situ, but because they still carry their merger features
from their previous halo environments. Conclusions. Investigating the merger
relics of cluster galaxies is potentially important, because it uniquely allows
us to backtrack the halo merger history.

discrete default intensity and barrier under constant risk free short rate
using higher order binary options and their integrals. In our credit risk
model, the risk free short rate is a constant and the default event occurs in
an expected manner when the firm value reaches a given default barrier at
predetermined discrete announcing dates or in an unexpected manner at the first
jump time of a Poisson process with given default intensity given by a step
function of time variable, respectively. We consider both endogenous and
exogenous default recovery. Our pricing problem is derived to a solving problem
of inhomogeneous or homogeneous Black-Scholes PDEs with different coefficients
and terminal value of binary type in every subinterval between the two adjacent
announcing dates. In order to deal with the difference of coefficients in
subintervals we use a relation between prices of higher order binaries with
different coefficients. In our model, due to the inhomogenous term related to
endogenous recovery, our pricing formulae are represented by not only the
prices of higher binary options but also the integrals of them. So we consider
a special binary option called integral of i-th binary or nothing and then we
obtain the pricing formulae of our defaultable corporate bond by using the
pricing formulae of higher binary options and integrals of them.

smoothness parameter $\alpha$ to describe the influence of local inhomogeneity
on angular diameter distance, and they obtained the angular diameter
distance-redshift approximate relation (Dyer-Roeder equation) for locally
inhomogeneous universe. Furthermore, the Distance-Duality (DD) relation,
$D_L(z)(1+z)^{-2}/D_A(z)=1$, should be valid for all cosmological models that
are described by Riemannian geometry, where $D_L$ and $D_A$ are, respectively,
the luminosity and angular distance distances. Therefore, it is necessary to
test whether if the Dyer-Roeder approximate equation can satisfy the
Distance-Duality relation. In this paper, we use Union2.1 SNe Ia data to
constrain the smoothness parameter $\alpha$ and test whether the Dyer-Roeder
equation satisfies the DD relation. By using $\chi^2$ minimization, we get
$\alpha=0.92_{-0.32}^{+0.08}$ at $1\sigma$ and $0.92_{-0.65}^{+0.08}$ at

area networks (WBANs) is an important problem as WBANs become more pervasive.
Here, two-hop relay-assisted cooperative communications using opportunistic
relaying (OR) is proposed for enhancement of coexistence for WBANs. Suitable
time division multiple access (TDMA) schemes are employed for both intra-WBAN
and inter-WBANs access protocols. To emulate actual conditions of WBAN use,
extensive on-body and inter-body ""everyday"" channel measurements are employed.
In addition, a realistic inter-WBAN channel model is simulated to investigate
the effect of body shadowing and hub location on WBAN performance in enabling
coexistence. When compared with single-link communications, it is found that
opportunistic relaying can provide significant improvement, in terms of
signal-to-interference+noise ratio (SINR), to outage probability and level
crossing rate (LCR) into outages. However, average outage duration (AOD) is not
affected. In addition a lognormal distribution shows a better fit to received
SINR when the channel coherence time is small, and a Nakagami-m distribution is
a more common fit when the channel is more stable. According to the estimated
SINR distributions, theoretical outage probability, LCR and AOD are shown to
match the empirical results well.

previously unpublished spectra of 93 SNe Ia. The observations cover a range of
phases from 12 days before to over 150 days after the time of B-band maximum
light. With the addition of 228 near-maximum spectra from the literature we
study the diversity among SNe Ia in a quantitative manner. For that purpose,
spectroscopic parameters are employed such as expansion velocities from
spectral line blueshifts, and pseudo-equivalent widths (pW). The values of
those parameters at maximum light are obtained for 78 objects, thus providing a
characterization of SNe Ia that may help to improve our understanding of the
properties of the exploding systems and the thermonuclear flame propagation.
Two objects, namely SNe 2005M and 2006is, stand out from the sample by showing
peculiar Si II and S II velocities but otherwise standard velocities for the
rest of the ions. We further study the correlations between spectroscopic and
photometric parameters such as light-curve decline rate and color. In agreement
with previous studies, we find that the pW of Si II absorption features are
very good indicators of light-curve decline rate. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that parameters such as pW2(SiII4130) and pW6(SiII5972) provide precise
calibrations of the peak B-band luminosity with dispersions of ~0.15 mag. In
the search for a secondary parameter in the calibration of peak luminosity for
SNe Ia, we find a ~2--3-sigma correlation between B-band Hubble residuals and
the velocity at maximum light of S II and Si II lines.

$a_1H_\delta\geq H\geq a_2H_\delta$ for some $a_1,a_2>0$ where $H_\delta$ is a
generalized Gru\v{s}in operator, \[
H_\delta=-\nabla_{x_1}\,|x_1|^{(2\delta_1,2\delta_1')}\,\nabla_{x_1}-|x_1|^{(2\delta_2,2\delta_2')}\,\nabla_{x_2}^2

  $\delta_2,\delta_2'\geq0$ and $|x_1|^{(2\delta,2\delta')}=|x_1|^{2\delta}$ if
$|x_1|\leq 1$ and $|x_1|^{(2\delta,2\delta')}=|x_1|^{2\delta'}$ if $|x_1|\geq
1$.
  \smallskip
  We prove that the Poincar\'e inequality, formulated in terms of the
Riemannian geometry corresponding to $H$, is valid if $n\geq 2$, or if $n=1$
and $\delta_1\vee\delta_1'\in[0,1/2\rangle$ but it fails if $n=1$ and
$\delta_1\vee\delta_1'\in[1/2,1\rangle$. The failure is caused by the leading
term. If $\delta_1\in[1/2, 1\rangle$ it is an effect of the local degeneracy
$|x_1|^{2\delta_1}$ but if $\delta_1\in[0, 1/2\rangle$ and $\delta_1'\in
[1/2,1\rangle$ it is an effect of the growth at infinity of
$|x_1|^{2\delta_1'}$.
  If $n=1$ and $\delta_1\in[1/2, 1\rangle$ then the semigroup $S$ generated by
the Friedrichs' extension of $H$ is not ergodic. The subspaces $x_1\geq 0$ and
$x_1\leq 0$ are $S$-invariant and the Poincar\'e inequality is valid on each of
these subspaces. If, however, $n=1$, $\delta_1\in[0, 1/2\rangle$ and
$\delta_1'\in [1/2,1\rangle$ then the semigroup $S$ is ergodic but the
Poincar\'e inequality is only valid locally.

  Finally we discuss the implication of these results for the kernel of the
semigroup $S$.

that our exact expressions for the transport functions can be obtained from

  Uncertainty",,,,,"cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There is a growing need for methods which can capture uncertainties and
answer queries over graph-structured data. Two common types of uncertainty are
uncertainty over the attribute values of nodes and uncertainty over the
existence of edges. In this paper, we combine those with identity uncertainty.
Identity uncertainty represents uncertainty over the mapping from objects
mentioned in the data, or references, to the underlying real-world entities. We
propose the notion of a probabilistic entity graph (PEG), a probabilistic graph
model that defines a distribution over possible graphs at the entity level. The
model takes into account node attribute uncertainty, edge existence
uncertainty, and identity uncertainty, and thus enables us to systematically
reason about all three types of uncertainties in a uniform manner. We introduce
a general framework for constructing a PEG given uncertain data at the
reference level and develop highly efficient algorithms to answer subgraph
pattern matching queries in this setting. Our algorithms are based on two novel
ideas: context-aware path indexing and reduction by join-candidates, which
drastically reduce the query search space. A comprehensive experimental
evaluation shows that our approach outperforms baseline implementations by
orders of magnitude.

  79, 1143-1164, 2017",,,"stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Large-scale multiple testing with highly correlated test statistics arises
frequently in many scientific research. Incorporating correlation information
in estimating false discovery proportion has attracted increasing attention in
recent years. When the covariance matrix of test statistics is known, Fan, Han
& Gu (2012) provided a consistent estimate of False Discovery Proportion (FDP)
under arbitrary dependence structure. However, the covariance matrix is often
unknown in many applications and such dependence information has to be
estimated before estimating FDP (Efron, 2010). The estimation accuracy can
greatly affect the convergence result of FDP or even violate its consistency.
In the current paper, we provide methodological modification and theoretical
investigations for estimation of FDP with unknown covariance. First we develop
requirements for estimates of eigenvalues and eigenvectors such that we can
obtain a consistent estimate of FDP. Secondly we give conditions on the
dependence structures such that the estimate of FDP is consistent. Such
dependence structures include sparse covariance matrices, which have been
popularly considered in the contemporary random matrix theory. When data are
sampled from an approximate factor model, which encompasses most practical
situations, we provide a consistent estimate of FDP via exploiting this
specific dependence structure. The results are further demonstrated by
simulation studies and some real data applications.

WIMP with renormalizable interaction. According to results of direct searches
and the nature of DM (electrical neutral and being a pure weak eigenstate), the
quantum number of DM is determined to be $I_3=Y=0$. There are only two possible
cases: either DM has non-vanishing weak isospin ($I\neq 0$) or it is an
isosinglet (I=0). In the first case, the Sommerfeld enhancement is sizable for
large $I$, producing large $\chi^0\bar{\chi^0}\to VV$ rates. In particular, we
obtain large $\chi\bar\chi\to W^+ W^-$ cross section, which is comparable to
the latest bounds from indirect searches and $m_\chi$ is constrained to be
larger than few hundred GeV to few TeV. It is possible to give correct relic
density with $m_\chi$ higher than these lower bounds. In the second case, to
couple DM to standard model (SM) particles, a SM-singlet vector mediator $X$ is
required from renormalizability and the SM gauge quantum numbers. To satisfy
the latest bounds of direct searches and to reproduce the DM relic density at
the same time, resonant enhancement in DM annihilation diagram is needed. Thus,
the masses of DM and the mediator are related. Furthermore, this model is not
sufficient to explain the deviation in muon $g-2$.

common problem for public transport authorities. This problem is also known as
the Origin- Destination estimation (OD) problem and it has been widely studied
for the past thirty years. However, the theory is missing when the observations
are not limited to the passenger counts but also includes station surveys. Our
aim is to provide a solid framework for the estimation of an OD matrix when
only a portion of the journey counts are observable. Our method consists of a
statistical estimation technique for OD matrix when we have the sum-of-row
counts and survey-based observations. Our technique differs from the previous
studies in that it does not need a prior OD matrix which can be hard to obtain.
Instead, we model the passengers behavior through the survey data, and use the
diagonalization of the partial OD matrix to reduce the space parameter and
derive a consistent global OD matrix estimator. We demonstrate the robustness
of our estimator and apply it to several examples showcasing the proposed
models and approach. We highlight how other sources of data can be incorporated
in the model such as explanatory variables, e.g. rainfall, indicator variables
for major events, etc, and inference made in a principled, non-heuristic way.

quasi-periodic oscillation is not uniform and has multiple peaks, which
displays random feature. This letter suggests that these challenges could be
easy to understand if the quasi-periodic oscillation originates in jets of
compact objects. With a seed periodicity originating in either neutron star
spin or accretion, shell collision develops in jet. The corresponding twin
kilo-Hertz quasi-periodic oscillations automatically carry random feature, vary
in frequency; and couple with luminosity, spectral properties, which well
account for the observation of 4U 1820-30. New quasi-periodic oscillation of 4U

recently offered. We herein extend the number of the known expansion
coefficients from 6 to 20 for the hyper-cubic lattices of general dimension d

that this extension can lead to accurate numerical estimates of the p-dependent
entropy for lattices with dimension d > 2. The computations of this paper have
led us to make the following marvelous conjecture: ""In the case of the
hyper-cubic lattices, all the expansion coefficients, a_k(d), are positive""!
This paper results from a simple melding of two disparate research programs:
one computing to high orders the Mayer series coefficients of a dimer gas, the
other studying the development of entropy from these coefficients. An effort is

defined as the probability distributions of the shadowing time during which

time-series data on forces and the inter-distances for one and two individuals.
Overall intermittencies were similar in the boundary and central areas.
However, the intermittencies were remarkably different between the one- and the
two-individual groups: the single line was used to fit the data for the
one-individual group whereas two phases were observed with breakpoints
(approximately 10 seconds in logarithm) in the exponential fitting curves for
the two-individual group. A difference in the probability distributions of

must also independently constrain photon number non-conservation arising from
the possible coupling of SN photons to the dark energy scalar field. We discuss
how observational determinations of the background temperature at different

constraints on interactions between scalar fields and photons, thus breaking
this degeneracy. We also discuss prospects for future improvements,

by Schwarzschild black hole lensing. When a gravitating body is surrounded by a
plasma, the lensing angle depends on a frequency of the electromagnetic wave
due to refraction properties, and the dispersion properties of the light
propagation in gravitational field in plasma. The last effect leads to
difference, even in uniform plasma, of gravitational deflection angle in plasma
from vacuum case. This angle depends on the photon frequency, what resembles
the properties of the refractive prism spectrometer. Here we consider the case
of a strong deflection angle for the light, traveling near the Schwarzschild
black hole, surrounded by a uniform plasma. Asymptotic formulae are obtained
for the case of a very large deflection angle, exceeding $2\pi$. We apply these
formulae for calculation of position and magnification of relativistic images
in a homogeneous plasma, which are formed by the photons performing one or
several revolutions around the central object. We conclude that the presence of
the uniform plasma increases the angular size of relativistic rings or the
angular separation of point images from the gravitating center. The presence of
the uniform plasma increases also a magnification of relativistic images. The
angular separation and the magnification become significantly larger than in
the vacuum case, when the photon frequency goes to a plasma frequency.

($T_A$) increases from 400 to 600 $^0$C. The extent of \emph{L}$2_1$ ordering
in the films annealed at 600 $^0$C is $\approx 96%$. The static magnetization
measurements by vibrating sample magnetometry shows a maximum moment of 4.95
$\mu_B$ per formula unit with low coercivity ($H_C$ $\approx$ 65 Oe) in the
films annealed at 600 $^0$C. A rigorous analysis of the azimuthal and polar
angle dependent ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) measured at several temperatures
allows determination of various anisotropy fields relevant to our system as a
function of $T_A$. Finally, we have evaluated the exchange stiffness constant
down to 100 K using spin wave modes in FMR spectra. We have also estimated the
exchange energies as well as stiffness constant by varying the lattice
parameter \emph{ab-initio} using the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker method.

temperature over the radio sky have led recently to suggestions that there
exists a substantial unexplained extragalactic radio background. Consequently,
there have been numerous attempts to place constraints on plausible origins for
the `excess'. We suggest here this expectation of a large extragalactic
background, over and above that contributed by the sources observed in the
surveys, is based on an extremely simple geometry adopted to model the Galactic
emission and the procedure adopted in the estimation of the extragalactic
contribution. In this paper, we derive the extragalactic radio background from
wide-field radio images by using a more realistic modeling of the Galactic
emission and decompose the sky maps at 150, 408, and 1420 MHz into anisotropic
Galactic and isotropic extragalactic components. The anisotropic Galactic
component is assumed to arise from a highly flattened spheroid representing the
thick disc, embedded in a spherical halo, both centered at the Galactic center,
along with Galactic sources, filamentary structures, Galactic loops and spurs.
All components are constrained to be positive and the optimization scheme
minimizes the sky area occupied by the complex filaments. We show that in
contrast to the simple modeling of the Galactic emission as a plane parallel
slab, the more realistic modeling yields estimates for the uniform
extragalactic brightness that is consistent with expectations from known
extragalactic radio source populations.

MHD waves in the vicinity of 2D null points are well known. The waves are
decoupled and accumulate at predictable parts of the magnetic topology: fast
waves accumulate at the null point; whereas Alfv\'en waves cannot cross the
separatricies. However, in nonlinear MHD mode conversion can occur at regions
of inhomogeneous Alfv\'en speed, suggesting that the decoupled nature of waves
may not extend to the nonlinear regime. Aims: We investigate the behaviour of
low-amplitude Alfv\'en waves about a 2D magnetic null point in nonlinear,
{\beta}= 0 MHD. Methods: We numerically simulate the introduction of
low-amplitude Alfv\'en waves into the vicinity of a magnetic null point using
the nonlinear LARE2D code. Results: Unlike in the linear regime, we find that
the Alfv\'en wave sustains cospatial daughter disturbances, manifest in the
transverse and longitudinal fluid velocity, owing to the action of nonlinear
magnetic pressure gradients (viz. the ponderomotive force). These disturbances
are dependent on the Alfv\'en wave and do not interact with the medium to
excite magnetoacoustic waves, although the transverse daughter becomes focused
at the null point. Additionally, an independently propagating fast
magnetoacoustic wave is generated during the early stages, which transports
some of the initial Alfv\'en wave energy towards the null point. Subsequently,
despite undergoing dispersion and phase-mixing due to gradients in the
Alfv\'en-speed profile (Grad c_A \neq 0) there is no further nonlinear
generation of fast waves. Conclusions: We find that Alfv\'en waves at 2D cold
null points behave largely as in the linear regime, however they sustain
transverse and longitudinal disturbances - effects absent in the linear regime
- due to nonlinear magnetic pressure gradients.

$G=(V,E)$ that is either finite or infinite. Suppose that a fire breaks out at
a given vertex $v \in V$. In each subsequent time unit, a firefighter protects
one vertex which is not yet on fire, and then the fire spreads to all
unprotected neighbors of the vertices on fire. The objective of the firefighter
is to save as many vertices as possible (if $G$ is finite) or to stop the fire
from spreading (for an infinite case).
  The surviving rate $\rho(G)$ of a finite graph $G$ is defined as the expected
percentage of vertices that can be saved when a fire breaks out at a vertex of
$G$ that is selected uniformly random. For a finite square grid $P_n \square
P_n$, we show that $5/8 + o(1) \le \rho(P_n \square P_n) \le 67243/105300 +
o(1)$ (leaving the gap smaller than 0.014) and conjecture that the surviving
rate is asymptotic to 5/8.
  We define the surviving rate for infinite graphs and prove it to be 1/4 for
the infinite square grid, even in the case of finitely many initial fires. For
the infinite hexagonal grid we provide a winning strategy if two additional
vertices can be protected at any point of the process, and we conjecture that
the firefighter has no strategy to stop the fire without additional help. We
also show how the speed of the spreading fire can be reduced by a constant
factor.

the aggregate activity of local brain regions can exhibit a rich variety of
dynamical patterns emerging via spontaneous breaking of permutation or
translational symmetry. Our results connect recent experimental findings and
suggest that a range of complicated activity patterns seen in the brain could
be explained even without a full knowledge of its wiring diagram.

an anomalous dimension of the matter superfields is studied within the Slavnov
higher derivative regularization approach. It is shown that if the
renormalization group functions are defined in terms of the bare coupling
constant, this relation is always valid. In the renormalized theory the NSVZ
relation is obtained in the momentum subtraction scheme supplemented by a
special finite renormalization. Unlike the dimensional reduction, the higher
derivative regularization allows to fix this finite renormalization. This is
made by imposing the conditions $Z_3(\alpha,\mu=\Lambda)=1$ and
$Z(\alpha,\mu=\Lambda)=1$ on the renormalization constants of ${\cal N}=1$
SQED, where $\Lambda$ is a parameter in the higher derivative term. The results
are verified by the explicit three-loop calculation. In this approximation we
relate the $\bar{{DR}}$ scheme and the NSVZ scheme defined within the higher

naturally leads to the remnants in black hole evaporation. Our calculation

effects. The evaporation singularity is then avoided.

by studying a liquid metal flow in a cubic domain. We focus on the mechanisms
that determine whether the flow is quasi-2D, 3D or in any intermediate state.
To this end, forcing is applied by injecting a DC current $I$ through one wall
of the cube only, to drive vortices spinning along the magnetic field.
Depending on the intensity of the externally applied magnetic field, these
vortices extend part or all of the way through the cube. Driving the flow in
this way allows us to precisely control not only the forcing intensity but also
its dimensionality. A comparison with the theoretical analysis of this
configuration singles out the influences of the walls and of the forcing on the
flow dimensionality, which is characterised in several ways. First, when
inertia drives three-dimensionality, the velocity near the wall where current
is injected scales as $U_b\sim I^{2/3}$. Second, when the distance $l_z$ over
which momentum diffuses under the action of the Lorentz force reaches the
channel width $h$, the velocity near the opposite wall $U_t$ follows a similar
law with a correction factor $(1-h/l_z)$. When $l_z<h$, by contrast, the
opposite wall has less influence on the flow and $U_t\sim I^{1/2}$. The central
role played by the ratio $l_z/h$ is confirmed by experimentally verifying
Sommeria & Moreau (1982)'s scaling $l_z\sim N^{1/2}$ ($N$ is the interaction
parameter) and finally, the nature of the three-dimensionality is further
clarified by distinguishing weak and strong three-dimensionalities. It is found
that both vanish only asymptotically in the limit $N\rightarrow\infty$. This
provides evidence that because of the no-slip walls, 1) the transition between
quasi-2D and 3D turbulence does not result from a global instability of the
flow, and 2) it doesn't occur simultaneously at all scales.

in the three observed points in the outer tail. This yields an upper limit on
the molecular gas content of the whole tail < 1x10^7 M_sun, which is an amount
similar to the estimates from the observed star formation rate over the tail.
We also present strong upper limits on the X-ray emission of the stripped gas
in IC3418 from a new Chandra observation. The measured X-ray luminosity of the
IC3418 tail is about 280 times lower than that of ESO 137-001, a spiral galaxy
in a more distant cluster with a prominent ram pressure stripped tail.
Non-detection of any diffuse X-ray emission in the IC3418 tail may be due to a
low gas content in the tail associated with its advanced evolutionary state
and/or due to a rather low thermal pressure of the surrounding intra-cluster
medium.

of infrastructures for content distribution in the current Internet. This paper
addresses the problem of defining a realistic arrival process for the content
requests generated by users, due its critical importance for both analytical
and simulative evaluations of the performance of caching systems. First, with
the aid of YouTube traces collected inside operational residential networks, we
identify the characteristics of real traffic that need to be considered or can
be safely neglected in order to accurately predict the performance of a cache.
Second, we propose a new parsimonious traffic model, named the Shot Noise Model
(SNM), that enables users to natively capture the dynamics of content
popularity, whilst still being sufficiently simple to be employed effectively
for both analytical and scalable simulative studies of caching systems.
Finally, our results show that the SNM presents a much better solution to
account for the temporal locality observed in real traffic compared to existing
approaches.

proposed synchronization controllers aim at achieving both the control

measured by the norm of the pairwise state difference of the networked systems,
an adaptation of the gains is proposed. An alternative design arrives at
constant gains that are optimized with respect to an appropriate measure of

extensive numerical study examines the various aspects of the optimization and

the Hawking temperature. This indicates that the smaller holes have higher
surface gravity. For analogue Hawking effects, however, the acoustic surface
gravity is determined by the local values of the dynamical velocity of the
stationary background fluid flow and the speed of propagation of the
characteristic perturbation embedded in the background fluid, as well as by
their space derivatives evaluated along the direction normal to the acoustic
horizon, respectively. The mass of the analogue system - whether classical or
quantum - does not directly contribute to extremise the value of the associated
acoustic surface gravity. For general relativistic axially symmetric background
fluid flow in the Schwarzschild metric, we show that the initial boundary
conditions describing such accretion influence the maximization scheme of the
acoustic surface gravity and associated analogue temperature. Aforementioned
background flow onto black holes can assume three distinct geometric
configurations. Identical set of initial boundary conditions can lead to
entirely different phase-space behavior of the stationary flow solutions, as
well as the salient features of the associated relativistic acoustic geometry.
This implies that it is imperative to investigate how the measure of the
acoustic surface gravity corresponding to the accreting black holes gets
influenced by the geometric configuration of the inflow described by various
thermodynamic equations of state. Such investigation is useful to study the
effect of Einstenian gravity on the non-conventional classical features as

electrodynamics where several (artificial) atoms are coupled to a
one-dimensional superconducting transmission line. Since single microwave
photons can travel without loss for a long distance along the line, real and
virtual photons emitted by one atom can be reabsorbed or scattered by a second
atom. Depending on the distance between the atoms, this collective effect can
lead to super- and subradiance or to a coherent exchange-type interaction
between the atoms. Changing the artificial atoms transition frequencies,
something which can be easily done with superconducting qubits (two levels
artificial atoms), is equivalent to changing the atom-atom separation and
thereby opens the possibility to study the characteristics of these collective
effects. To study this waveguide quantum electrodynamics system, we extend
previous work and present an effective master equation valid for an ensemble of
inhomogeneous atoms driven by a coherent state. Using input-output theory, we
compute analytically and numerically the elastic and inelastic scattering and
show how these quantities reveal information about collective effects. These
theoretical results are compatible with recent experimental results using
transmon qubits coupled to a superconducting one-dimensional transmission line

phi^4 quantum field theory. By comparing to lattice Monte Carlo calculations,
perturbation theory and standard mean field theory, we test the quality of the
approximation in two, three, four and five dimensions. The quantities
considered in these tests are the critical coupling for the transition to the
ordered phase and the associated critical exponents nu and beta. We also map
out the phase diagram in four dimensions. In two and three dimensions, DMFT
incorrectly predicts a first order phase transition for all bare quartic
couplings, which is problematic, because the second order nature of the phase
transition of lattice phi^4-theory is crucial for taking the continuum limit.
Nevertheless, by extrapolating the behaviour away from the phase transition,
one can obtain critical couplings and critical exponents. They differ from
those of mean field theory and are much closer to the correct values. In four
dimensions the transition is second order for small quartic couplings and turns
weakly first order as the coupling increases beyond a tricritical value. In
dimensions five and higher, DMFT gives qualitatively correct results, predicts
reasonable values for the critical exponents and considerably more accurate
critical couplings than standard mean field theory. The approximation works
best for small values of the quartic coupling. We investigate the change from
first to second order transition in the local limit of DMFT which is
computationally much less intensive. We also discuss technical issues related
to the convergence of the non-linear self-consistency equation solver and the
solution of the effective single-site model using Fourier-space Monte Carlo
updates in the presence of a phi^4-interaction.

thermal sources and optical-electrical losses is discussed. The other cases
include the solution of the heat transfer problem and analyses are conducted on
the cell operating temperature and efficiency as a function of the thermal
conditions. This simulation tool is likely to allow new optimizations of
photovoltaic cells that include a thermal criterion in addition to the optical
and electrical criteria.

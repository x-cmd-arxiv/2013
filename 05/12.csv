sensing in which one aims to recover a signal from a collection of corrupted or
unreliable measurements. While an arbitrary signal cannot be recovered in the
face of arbitrary corruption, tractable recovery is possible when both signal
and corruption are suitably structured. We quantify the relationship between
signal recovery and two geometric measures of structure, the Gaussian
complexity of a tangent cone and the Gaussian distance to a subdifferential. We
take a convex programming approach to disentangling signal and corruption,
analyzing both penalized programs that trade off between signal and corruption
complexity, and constrained programs that bound the complexity of signal or
corruption when prior information is available. In each case, we provide
conditions for exact signal recovery from structured corruption and stable
signal recovery from structured corruption with added unstructured noise. Our
simulations demonstrate close agreement between our theoretical recovery bounds
and the sharp phase transitions observed in practice. In addition, we provide
new interpretable bounds for the Gaussian complexity of sparse vectors,
block-sparse vectors, and low-rank matrices, which lead to sharper guarantees
of recovery when combined with our results and those in the literature.

the ""mixed"" molecular systems two types of coherent beats having either
electronic or vibrational character can be distinguished by analyzing
oscillation Fourier maps, constructed from time-resolved 2D spectra. The
amplitude of the beatings with the electronic character is heavily affected by
the energetic disorder and consequently electronic coherences are quickly
dephased. Beatings with the vibrational character depend weakly on the

physical processes responsible for their high-energy emission have been poorly
defined. A number of mechanisms are under active debate, including synchrotron
radiation, inverse-Comptonized CMB (IC/CMB) emission, and other Comptonization
processes. In a number of cases, the optical and X-ray emission of jet regions
are inked by a single spectral component, and in those, high- resolution
multi-band imaging and polarimetry can be combined to yield a powerful
diagnostic of jet emission processes. Here we report on deep imaging photometry
of the jet of PKS 1136$-$135 obtained with the {\it Hubble Space Telescope.} We
find that several knots are highly polarized in the optical, with fractional
polarization $\Pi>30%$. When combined with the broadband spectral shape
observed in these regions, this is very difficult to explain via IC/CMB models,
unless the scattering particles are at the lowest-energy tip of the electron
energy distribution, with Lorentz factor $\gamma \sim 1$, and the jet is also
very highly beamed ($\delta \geq 20$) and viewed within a few degrees of the
line of sight. We discuss both the IC/CMB and synchrotron interpretation of the
X-ray emission in the light of this new evidence, presenting new models of the
spectral energy distribution and also the matter content of this jet. The high
polarizations do not completely rule out the possibility of IC/CMB
optical-to-X-ray emission in this jet, but they do strongly disfavor the model.

work.

sequence and magnetic white dwarfs, which have similar total magnetic fluxes. I
propose a scenario in which a stable hydromagnetic equilibrium (containing a
poloidal and a toroidal field component) is established soon after the birth of
the neutron star, aided by the strong compositional stratification of neutron
star matter, and this state is slowly eroded by non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic
processes such as beta decays and ambipolar diffusion in the core of the star
and Hall drift and breaking of the solid in its crust. Over sufficiently long
time scales, the fluid in the neutron star core will behave as if it were
barotropic, because, depending on temperature and magnetic field strength, beta
decays will keep adjusting the composition to the chemical equilibrium state,
or ambipolar diffusion will decouple the charged component from the neutrons.
Therefore, the still open question regarding stable hydromagnetic equilibria in
barotropic fluids will become relevant for the evolution, at least for
``magnetar'' fields, too strong to be stabilized by the solid crust.

  results",,"10.1109/FOCS.2013.30",,"cs.DS cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-armed bandit problems are the predominant theoretical model of
exploration-exploitation tradeoffs in learning, and they have countless
applications ranging from medical trials, to communication networks, to Web
search and advertising. In many of these application domains the learner may be
constrained by one or more supply (or budget) limits, in addition to the
customary limitation on the time horizon. The literature lacks a general model
encompassing these sorts of problems. We introduce such a model, called
""bandits with knapsacks"", that combines aspects of stochastic integer
programming with online learning. A distinctive feature of our problem, in
comparison to the existing regret-minimization literature, is that the optimal
policy for a given latent distribution may significantly outperform the policy
that plays the optimal fixed arm. Consequently, achieving sublinear regret in
the bandits-with-knapsacks problem is significantly more challenging than in
conventional bandit problems.
  We present two algorithms whose reward is close to the information-theoretic
optimum: one is based on a novel ""balanced exploration"" paradigm, while the
other is a primal-dual algorithm that uses multiplicative updates. Further, we
prove that the regret achieved by both algorithms is optimal up to
polylogarithmic factors. We illustrate the generality of the problem by
presenting applications in a number of different domains including electronic
commerce, routing, and scheduling. As one example of a concrete application, we
consider the problem of dynamic posted pricing with limited supply and obtain
the first algorithm whose regret, with respect to the optimal dynamic policy,
is sublinear in the supply.

important field of research in the last years, mainly as a result of advances
in the characterization of dynamical systems from the signals they produce, the
introduction of concepts such as generalized and phase synchronization and the
application of information theory to time series analysis. In neurophysiology,
different analytical tools stemming from these concepts have added to the
'traditional' set of linear methods, which includes the cross-correlation and
the coherency function in the time and frequency domain, respectively, or more
elaborated tools such as Granger Causality. This increase in the number of
approaches to tackle the existence of functional (FC) or effective connectivity
(EC) between two (or among many) neural networks, along with the mathematical
complexity of the corresponding time series analysis tools, makes it desirable
to arrange them into a unified-easy-to-use software package. The goal is to
allow neuroscientists, neurophysiologists and researchers from related fields
to easily access and make use of these analysis methods from a single

model is that all the threads share the same address space and, therefore, are
implicitly assumed to be mutually trusted. This assumption, however, does not
take into consideration of many modern multithreaded applications that involve
multiple principals which do not fully trust each other. It remains challenging
to retrofit the classic multithreaded programming model so that the security
and privilege separation in multi-principal applications can be resolved.
  This paper proposes ARBITER, a run-time system and a set of security
primitives, aimed at fine-grained and data-centric privilege separation in
multithreaded applications. While enforcing effective isolation among
principals, ARBITER still allows flexible sharing and communication between
threads so that the multithreaded programming paradigm can be preserved. To
realize controlled sharing in a fine-grained manner, we created a novel
abstraction named ARBITER Secure Memory Segment (ASMS) and corresponding OS
support. Programmers express security policies by labeling data and principals
via ARBITER's API following a unified model. We ported a widely-used, in-memory
database application (memcached) to ARBITER system, changing only around 100

wide range of scientific innovations, as attributed to their abilities of
creating fascinating patterns over small scales. Here, we demonstrate a new
thin film instability phenomenon governed by electro-mechanics and
hydrodynamics over interfacial scales in a narrow fluidic confinement. We first
bring out the essential physics of this instability mechanism, in consideration
with the fact that under the action of axial electrical field in a confined
microfluidic environment, perturbations may be induced on the interfaces of
thin corner films formed adjacent to the walls of a microchannel, leading to
the inception of ordered lateral structures. A critical electric field exists
beyond which these structures from the walls of the confinement intermingle to
evolve into localized gas pockets in the form of bubbles. These bubbles do not
remain static with further changes in electric field, but undergo a sequence of
elongation-deformation-breakup episode in a dynamically evolving manner. By
elucidating the complex interplay of electro-hydrodynmic forces and surface
tension, we offer further insights into a new paradigm of interfacial
instability mediated controlled microbubble manipulation for on-chip
applications, bearing far-ranging scientific and technological consequences in
executing designed fluidic operations in confined miniaturized environment.

produce hydrogen is a promising avenue for sustainable energy production. The
greatest virtue of PEC is that it uses sunlight as the only source to split
water, but its efficiencies are still quite low due to poor performances of the
available materials (such as SrTiO3). Consequently, another way of PEC research
has been developed. By simultaneously using sunlight and electricity as energy
source, PEC can get a larger current at a lower voltage, i.e., hydrogen can be
made under the voltage below 1.23V, the minimum voltage required by
electrolysis of water. But so far the efficiencies of the mainstream materials
(such as TiO2) remain low. Where is the future development direction of PEC?
Here we propose a new PEC model. Its operating principle is quite the opposite
of the aforesaid conventional PEC, that is, the previous
photoanode/photocathode is converted into the present photocathode/photoanode.
It can also obtain high current under low voltage, even near zero voltage in
extreme conditions. A basic single configuration and an improved n-p
configuration were designed. We reselected materials for photoelectrodes, and
confirmed its feasibility successfully. Two preliminary results were obtained
from two contrasts: whether compared with water electrolysis or conventional
PEC water splitting, the inverse PEC showed promising superiority.

of the domains exhibit power-law growth with the exponent having the
Lifshitz-Slyozov value of 1/3 from very early time. However, our analysis shows
that for low enough temperatures, the growth exponent at early time is smaller
than the Lifshitz-Slyozov value. For composition dependence, we find that at
moderate temperature, even for extreme off-critical composition, curvature
dependent correction to the growth law is weak which is counterintuitive in
this case that gives rise to droplet morphology. This is however consistent
with the recent understanding on curvature dependence of surface tension.

Bayesian inference of contaminant source location and characteristics in an

represents transient contaminant fate and transport as a random function with
multivariate Gaussian process prior. Hyper-parameters of the Gaussian process
prior are inferred using a set of contaminant fate and transport simulation
runs obtained at predefined source locations and characteristics. This paper
uses an integrated multizone-CFD model to simulate contaminant fate and
transport. Mean of the Gaussian process, conditional on the inferred
hyper-parameters, is used as an computationally efficient statistical emulator
of the multizone-CFD simulator. In the post event-detection stage, the Bayesian
framework is used to infer the source location and characteristics using the
contaminant concentration data obtained through a sensor network. The Gaussian
process emulator of the contaminant fate and transport is used for Markov Chain
Monte Carlo sampling to efficiently explore the posterior distribution of
source location and characteristics. Efficacy of the proposed method is
demonstrated for a hypothetical contaminant release through multiple sources in
a single storey seven room building. The method is found to infer location and
characteristics of the multiple sources accurately. The posterior distribution
obtained using the proposed method is found to agree closely with the posterior

fraction (concentration) of solid particles in the mixture becomes zero. The
jump relations for pressure, density, temperature, particle velocity, and

topological term. In the two-dimensional case, the system can be mapped onto an
O(4)-like NLSM with some O(3) anisotropy. Interestingly, we find that if
hedgehog-like point defects are included together with the restoration of the
full O(4) symmetry, our model is identical to a kind of SU(2)
symmetry-protected topological (SPT) state. Additionally, if the system has the
O(5) symmetry instead, the effective NLSM with Wess-Zumino-Witten term is just
a description of the surface modes of a three-dimensional SPT state, though
such O(5) NLSM could not be a proper description of Kondo spin liquid phase due
to its gaplessness. We expect that the discussions might provide useful threads
to identify certain microscopic bilayer antiferromagnet models (and related

a frequency $\omega_c$ and a two-level system with a resonance frequency
$\omega_0$. It is shown here that the spectrum of the Rabi model coincides with
the support of the discrete Stieltjes integral measure in the orthogonality
relations of recently introduced orthogonal polynomials. The exactly solvable
limit of the Rabi model corresponding to $\Delta=\omega_0/(2\omega_c)=0$, which
describes a displaced harmonic oscillator, is characterized by the discrete
Charlier polynomials in normalized energy $\upepsilon$, which are orthogonal on
an equidistant lattice. A non-zero value of $\Delta$ leads to non-classical
discrete orthogonal polynomials $\phi_{k}(\upepsilon)$ and induces a
deformation of the underlying equidistant lattice. The results provide a basis
for a novel analytic method of solving the Rabi model. The number of ca. {\em
1350} calculable energy levels per parity subspace obtained in double precision
(cca 16 digits) by an elementary stepping algorithm is up to two orders of
magnitude higher than is possible to obtain by Braak's solution. Any first $n$
eigenvalues of the Rabi model arranged in increasing order can be determined as
zeros of $\phi_{N}(\upepsilon)$ of at least the degree $N=n+n_t$. The value of
$n_t>0$, which is slowly increasing with $n$, depends on the required
precision. For instance, $n_t\simeq 26$ for $n=1000$ and dimensionless
interaction constant $\kappa=0.2$, if double precision is required. Although we
can rigorously prove our results only for dimensionless interaction constant
$\kappa< 1$, numerics and exactly solvable example suggest that the main
conclusions remain to be valid also for $\kappa\ge 1$.

utilizing KLJN protocol during the first run and noise-based logic (NBL)
hyperspace vector string verification method for the challenge/response during
the rest of its life or until it is re-initialized. Finally, the simplest PUF
utilizes NBL without KLJN thus it can be cloned by the manufacturer but not by
anybody else.

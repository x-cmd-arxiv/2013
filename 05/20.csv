This projection produces ODEs whose solutions are exactly the stationary states
of the effective Lagrangian that would be considered from applying the
variational approximation method. We illustrate our approach by applying it to
a modified Fisher equation for a travelling front, containing a

while they may at the same time display anisotropy. The present contribution
thus aims at studying jointly selfsimilarity and anisotropy by focusing on a
specific classical class of Gaussian anisotropic selfsimilar processes. It will
first be shown that accurate joint estimates of the anisotropy and
selfsimilarity parameters are performed by replacing the standard 2D-discrete
wavelet transform by the hyperbolic wavelet transform, which permits the use of
different dilation factors along the horizontal and vertical axis. Defining
anisotropy requires a reference direction that needs not a priori match the
horizontal and vertical axes according to which the images are digitized, this
discrepancy defines a rotation angle. Second, we show that this rotation angle
can be jointly estimated. Third, a non parametric bootstrap based procedure is
described, that provides confidence interval in addition to the estimates
themselves and enables to construct an isotropy test procedure, that can be
applied to a single texture image. Fourth, the robustness and versatility of
the proposed analysis is illustrated by being applied to a large variety of
different isotropic and anisotropic self-similar fields. As an illustration, we
show that a true anisotropy built-in self-similarity can be disentangled from
an isotropic self-similarity to which an anisotropic trend has been
superimposed.

two subsystems of a composite system, thereby making the measured state useless

The weak measurement acts gently on quantum system and do not force the system
state to decohere completely, thus revealing the super quantum discord, which
can take value more than that of the normal quantum discord. Remarkably, we
prove that the super quantum discord in the post measured state is equal to the
difference between the super quantum discord and the normal quantum discord in
the original state. Thus, the weak measurement has the ability to resurrect the
lost quantumness of any composite quantum state. This suggests a conservation
law for the extra quantum correlation in any composite state. The amount of
extra quantum correlation which is destroyed by the projective measurement in

Destruction of this state by a specially designed stimulation is a challenge of

case of a large degree of uncertainty about important features of the system is

additional adaptation of parameters. The adaptation also ensures
desynchronization of ensembles with non-stationary, time-varying parameters. We

approach for identifying genetic markers associated with trait while mixed
model is successful in accounting for a complicated dependence structure among

advantages of penalization approach and linear mixed model. In this study, a
GWAS with multiple highly correlated traits is analyzed. For GWAS with multiple
quantitative traits that are highly correlated, the analysis using traits
marginally inevitably lose some essential information among multiple traits. We
propose a penalized-MTMM, a penalized multivariate linear mixed model that
allows both the within-trait and between-trait variance components
simultaneously for multiple traits. The proposed penalized-MTMM estimates
variance components using an AI-REML method and conducts variable selection and
point estimation simultaneously using group MCP and sparse group MCP. Best
linear unbiased predictor (BLUP) is used to find predictive values and the
Pearson's correlations between predictive values and their corresponding
observations are used to evaluate prediction performance. Both prediction and
selection performance of the proposed approach and its comparison with the
uni-trait penalized-LMM are evaluated through simulation studies. We apply the
proposed approach to a GWAS data from Genetic Analysis Workshop (GAW) 18.

momentum-type constraint was investigated. In the present work, the first steps
to generalise this analysis to cases where more constraints occur are
developed. The system under consideration contains two momentum-type
constraints, originally abelian, where rescalings of these constraints by a
non-vanishing function of the coordinates are allowed. These rescalings induce
structure functions at the level of the gauge algebra. Providing a specific
parametrised family of real-valued scaling functions, the implementation of the
corresponding rescaled quantum momentum-type constraints is performed using RAQ
when the gauge algebra: (i) remains abelian and (ii) undergoes into an algebra
of a nonunimodular group with nonconstant gauge invariant structure functions.
Case (ii) becomes the first example known to the author where an open algebra
is handled in refined algebraic quantisation. Challenging issues that arise in
the presence of non-gauge invariant structure functions are also addressed.

transport and introduce a new member to the family of social networks, which is
named Co-Travel Networks, consisting of passengers connected by their co-travel
behaviors. We propose a novel method to infer high quality co-travel networks
of civil aviation passengers from their co-booking behaviors derived from the
PNRs (Passenger Naming Records). In our method, to accurately evaluate the
strength of ties, we present a measure of Co-Journey Times to count the
co-travel times of complete journeys between passengers. We infer a high
quality co-travel network based on a large encrypted PNR dataset and conduct a
series of network analyses on it. The experimental results show the
effectiveness of our inferring method, as well as some special characteristics
of co-travel networks, such as the sparsity and high aggregation, compared with
other kinds of social networks. It can be expected that such co-travel networks
will greatly help the industry to better understand their passengers so as to
improve their services. More importantly, we contribute a special kind of
social networks with high strength of ties generated from very close and high
cost travel behaviors, for further scientific researches on human travel
behaviors, group travel patterns, high-end travel market evolution, etc., from

strong consequences for neutrino oscillation phenomena in astrophysics due to
relatively large scattering cross sections of relativistic neutrinos undergoing
large-angle radiation of energetic gravitons in gravitational field of a

been interpreted in the light of published calculations of free cytosine

level shifts of Au 4f imply that all of these compounds are chemisorbed.
Cytosine adsorbs as a single tautomer, but in two chemical states with
different surface-molecule bonding. For deposition in vacuum, a flat-lying
molecular state bonded through the N(3) atom of the pyrimidine ring dominates,
but a second state is also present. For deposition from solution, the second
state dominates, with the molecular plane no longer parallel to the surface.
This state also bonds through the N(3) atom, but in addition interacts with the
surface via the amino group. Two tautomers of 6-azacytosine were observed, and
they and 6-azacytidine adsorb with similar geometries, chemically bonding via
the azacytosine ring. The ribose ring does not appear to perturb the adsorption
of azacytidine compared with azacytosine. The azacytosine ring is nearly but
not perfectly parallel to the surface, like 5-azacytidine, which adsorbs as an

many important applications, such as web mining, bioinformatics and citation
analysis. Collective classification approaches exploit the dependencies of a
group of linked objects whose class labels are correlated and need to be
predicted simultaneously. In this paper, we focus on studying the collective
classification problem in heterogeneous networks, which involves multiple types
of data objects interconnected by multiple types of links. Intuitively, two
objects are correlated if they are linked by many paths in the network.
However, most existing approaches measure the dependencies among objects
through directly links or indirect links without considering the different
semantic meanings behind different paths. In this paper, we study the
collective classification problem taht is defined among the same type of
objects in heterogenous networks. Moreover, by considering different linkage
paths in the network, one can capture the subtlety of different types of
dependencies among objects. We introduce the concept of meta-path based
dependencies among objects, where a meta path is a path consisting a certain
sequence of linke types. We show that the quality of collective classification
results strongly depends upon the meta paths used. To accommodate the large
network size, a novel solution, called HCC (meta-path based Heterogenous
Collective Classification), is developed to effectively assign labels to a
group of instances that are interconnected through different meta-paths. The
proposed HCC model can capture different types of dependencies among objects
with respect to different meta paths. Empirical studies on real-world networks
demonstrate that effectiveness of the proposed meta path-based collective
classification approach.

adds phase and number fluctuations in the initial conditions, pushes the
theoretical results closer to the experimental observations but fails to
quantitatively reproduce them. An explanation of the delayed expansion as a
consequence of a new type of self-trapping mechanism, where quantum
correlations suppress tunneling even when there are no density gradients, is
discussed and supported by numerical time-dependent Density Matrix

multiple messages based on a linear code $C$. This construction can be regarded
as a generalization of the authentication scheme given by Safavi-Naini and

constructed with Reed-Solomon codes. The generalization to linear codes has the
similar advantages as generalizing Shamir's secret sharing scheme to linear
secret sharing sceme based on linear codes. For a fixed message base field
$\f$, our scheme allows arbitrarily many receivers to check the integrity of
their own messages, while the scheme of Safavi-Naini and Wang has a constraint
on the number of verifying receivers $V\leqslant q$. And we introduce access
structure in our scheme. Massey characterized the access structure of linear
secret sharing scheme by minimal codewords in the dual code whose first
component is 1. We slightly modify the definition of minimal codewords in
\cite{Massey93}. Let $C$ be a $[V,k]$ linear code. For any coordinate $i\in
\{1,2,\cdots,V\}$, a codeword $\vec{c}$ in $C$ is called minimal respect to $i$
if the codeword $\vec{c}$ has component 1 at the $i$-th coordinate and there is
no other codeword whose $i$-th component is 1 with support strictly contained
in that of $\vec{c}$. Then the security of receiver $R_i$ in our authentication
scheme is characterized by the minimal codewords respect to $i$ in the dual
code $C^\bot$.

paper, we study a new random sampling approach that consists in projecting the
signal over blocks of sensing vectors. A typical example is the case of blocks
made of horizontal lines in the 2D Fourier plane. We provide theoretical
results on the number of blocks that are required for exact sparse signal

time-frequency bases, that the main result is sharp in the sense that the
minimum amount of blocks necessary to reconstruct sparse signals cannot be
improved up to a multiplicative logarithmic factor. The proposed results
provide a good insight on the possibilities and limits of block compressed

and physicists primarily because of the speed up achieved by them over their

believed to be the primary phenomena behind this speed up. However their
precise role in quantum algorithms is yet unclear. In this article, we explore
the nature of entanglement in the Grover's search algorithm. This algorithm
enables searching of elements from an unstructured database quadratically
faster than the best known classical algorithm. Geometric measure of
entanglement has been used to quantify and analyse entanglement across
iterations of the algorithm. We reveal how the entanglement varies with
increase in the number of qubits and also with the number of marked or solution
states. Numerically, it is seen that the behaviour of the maximum value of
entanglement is monotonous with the number of qubits. Also, for a given value
of the number of qubits, a change in the marked states alters the amount of
entanglement. The amount of entanglement in the final state of the algorithm
has been shown to depend solely on the nature of the marked states. Explicit
analytical expressions are given showing the variation of entanglement with the
number of iterations and the global maximum value of entanglement attained
across all iterations of the algorithm.

with any linear diffusion operator is easily adopted from the Stochastic

of increased matrix dimensions, but we show that this can be mitigated by the

scattering on the basis of two different approaches: the standard finite volume
approach by Luscher and the recently introduced HAL QCD potential method.
Quenched QCD simulations are performed on lattices with extents
$N_s{=}16,24,32,48$ and $N_t{=}128$ as well as lattice spacing
$a{\sim}0.115\,\mathrm{fm}$ and a pion mass of $m_\pi{\sim}940\,\mathrm{MeV}$.
The phase shift and the scattering length are calculated in these two methods.
In the potential method, the error is dominated by the systematic uncertainty
associated with the violation of rotational symmetry due to finite lattice
spacing. In Luscher's approach, such systematic uncertainty is difficult to be
evaluated and thus is not included in this work. A systematic uncertainty
attributed to the quenched approximation, however, is not evaluated in both
methods. In case of the potential method, the phase shift can be calculated for
arbitrary energies below the inelastic threshold. The energy dependence of the
phase shift is also obtained from Luscher's method using different volumes
and/or nonrest-frame extension of it. The results are found to agree well with

decay of an unstable quantum state prepared at the initial time $t=0$. This
expression is function of the time $t$ at which a measurement is performed to
determine if the state has decayed and, if yes, in which one of the infinitely
many possible final states. For large times the energy spread is, as expected,
given by the decay width $\Gamma$ of the initial unstable state. However, if
the measurement of the final state is performed at a time $t$ comparable to (or
smaller than) the mean lifetime of the state $1/\Gamma$, then the uncertainty
on the energy of the final state is much larger than the decay width $\Gamma$.
Namely, for short times an uncertainty of the type $1/t$ dominates, while at
large times the usual spread $\Gamma$ is recovered. Then, we turn to a generic
two-body decay process and describe the energy uncertainty of each one of the
two outgoing particles. We apply these formulas to the two-body decays of the
neutral and charged pions and to the spontaneous emission process of an excited
atom. As a last step, we study a case in which the non-exponential decay is

emergence of gauge bosons as massless vector Nambu-Goldstone modes is triggered

the spontaneous SUSY violation in the visible sector. As a consequence, a
massless photon appears as a companion of a massless photino emerging as a
goldstino in the tree approximation, and remains massless due to the
simultaneously generated special gauge invariance. This invariance is only
restricted by the supplemented vector field constraint invariant under
supergauge transformations. Meanwhile, photino being mixed with another
goldstino appearing from a spontaneous SUSY violation in the hidden sector
largely turns into the light pseudo-goldstino. Such pseudo-goldstonic photinos
considered in an extended supersymmetric Standard Model framework are of a
special observational interest that, apart from some indication of the QED

  Reduction?","32 pages. Final version, to appear in SHPMP. Minor revision",,,,"math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Beginning with Anderson (1972), spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in
infinite quantum systems is often put forward as an example of (asymptotic)
emergence in physics, since in theory no finite system should display it. Even
the correspondence between theory and reality is at stake here, since numerous
real materials show SSB in their ground states (or equilibrium states at low
temperature), although they are finite. Thus against what is sometimes called
`Earman's Principle', a genuine physical effect (viz. SSB) seems theoretically
recovered only in some idealization (namely the thermodynamic limit),
disappearing as soon as the the idealization is removed. We review the
well-known arguments that (at first sight) no finite system can exhibit SSB,
using the formalism of algebraic quantum theory in order to control the
thermodynamic limit and unify the description of finite- and infinite-volume
systems. Using the striking mathematical analogy between the thermodynamic
limit and the classical limit, we show that a similar situation obtains in
quantum mechanics (which typically forbids SSB) versus classical mechanics
(which allows it). This discrepancy between formalism and reality is quite
similar to the measurement problem, and hence we address it in the same way,
adapting an argument of the author and Reuvers (2013) that was originally
intended to explain the collapse of the wave-function within conventional
quantum mechanics. Namely, exponential sensitivity to (asymmetric)
perturbations of the (symmetric) dynamics as the system size increases causes
symmetry breaking already in finite but very large quantum systems. This
provides continuity between finite- and infinite-volume descriptions of quantum
systems featuring SSB and hence restores Earman's Principle (at least in this
particularly threatening case).

the estimation of quantum discord is an intrinsically noisy procedure. Besides,

Solid state electrical devices possess great potential to scale up such
demonstrations from few-qubit control to larger scale quantum processors. In
this direction, coherent control of spin qubits has been achieved in
lithographically-defined double quantum dots in both GaAs and Si. However, it
is a formidable challenge to combine the electrical measurement capabilities of
engineered nanostructures with the benefits inherent to atomic spin qubits.
Here we demonstrate the coherent manipulation of an individual electron spin

Rabi oscillations, while a Hahn echo pulse sequence reveals a spin coherence
time (T2) exceeding 200 \mu s. This figure is expected to become even longer in
isotopically enriched 28Si samples. Together with the use of a device

TP-AGB phase. Compared to purely synthetic TP-AGB codes, COLIBRI relaxes a
significant part of their analytic formalism in favour of a detailed physics
applied to a complete envelope model, in which the stellar structure equations
are integrated from the atmosphere down to the bottom of the hydrogen-burning
shell. This allows to predict self-consistently: (i) the effective temperature,
and more generally the convective envelope and atmosphere structures, correctly
coupled to the changes in the surface chemical abundances and gas opacities;
(ii) sphericity effects in the atmospheres; (iii) the core mass-luminosity
relation and its break-down due to hot bottom burning (HBB) in the most massive
AGB stars, (iv) the HBB nucleosynthesis via the solution of a complete nuclear
network (pp chains, and the CNO, NeNa, MgAl cycles), including also the
production of 7Li via the Cameron-Fowler beryllium transport mechanism; (v) the
chemical composition of the pulse-driven convective zone; (vi) the onset and
quenching of the third dredge-up, with a suitable temperature criterion. At the
same time COLIBRI pioneers new techniques in the treatment of the physics of
stellar interiors. It is the first evolutionary code ever to use accurate
on-the-fly computation of the equation of state for roughly 800 atoms, ions,
molecules, and of the Rosseland mean opacities throughout the deep envelope.
Another distinguishing aspect of COLIBRI is its high computational speed. This
feature is necessary for calibrating the uncertain parameters and processes
that characterize the TP-AGB phase, a step of paramount importance for
producing reliable stellar population synthesis models of galaxies up to high
redshift. (abridged)

buckling behaviour of functionally graded material plates subjected to
mechanical and thermal load is numerically studied. The internal
discontinuities, viz., cracks and cutouts are represented independent of the
mesh within the framework of the extended finite element method and an enriched
shear flexible 4-noded quadrilateral element is used for the spatial
discretization. The properties are assumed to vary only in the thickness
direction and the effective properties are estimated using the Mori-Tanaka
homogenization scheme. The plate kinematics is based on the first order shear
deformation theory. The influence of various parameters, viz., the crack length
and its location, the cutout radius and its position, the plate aspect ratio
and the plate thickness on the critical buckling load is studied. The effect of
various boundary conditions is also studied. The numerical results obtained
reveal that the critical buckling load decreases with increase in the crack
length, the cutout radius and the material gradient index. This is attributed
to the degradation in the stiffness either due to the presence of local defects
or due to the change in the material composition.

1006 by the X-ray astronomy satellite Suzaku. The thermal spectrum from the
entire supernova remnant (SNR) exhibits prominent emission lines of O, Ne, Mg,
Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe. The observed abundance pattern in the ejecta components
is in good agreement with that predicted by a standard model of Type Ia
supernovae (SNe). The spatially resolved analysis reveals that the distribution
of the O-burning and incomplete Si-burning products (Si, S, and Ar) is
asymmetric, while that of the C-burning products (O, Ne, and Mg) is relatively
uniform in the SNR interior. The peak position of the former is clearly shifted
by 5' (~3.2 pc at a distance of 2.2 kpc) to the southeast from the SNR's
geometric center. Using the SNR age of ~1000 yr, we constrain the velocity
asymmetry (in projection) of ejecta to be ~3100 km/s. The abundance of Fe is
also significantly higher in the southeast region than in the northwest region.
Given that the non-uniformity is observed only among the heavier elements (Si
through Fe), we argue that SN 1006 originates from an asymmetric explosion, as
is expected from recent multi-dimensional simulations of Type Ia SNe, although
we cannot eliminate the possibility that an inhomogeneous ambient medium
induced the apparent non-uniformity. Possible evidence for the Cr K-shell line
and line broadening in the Fe K-shell emission is also found.

coupling. It is shown that a fractional vortex lattice is stabilized in the

where each site has a fixed stress condition. Species differ both in stress
tolerance and competitive ability. Stress tolerance is quantified as the
fraction of sites with stress conditions low enough to allow establishment.
Competitive ability is quantified as the propensity to win the competition for
empty sites. We derive the deterministic, discrete-time dynamical system for
the species abundances. We prove the conditions under which plant species can
coexist in a stable equilibrium. We show that the coexistence conditions can be

dimension, a Z_2 symmetry, termed KK-parity, ensures the stability of the
lightest Kaluza-Klein particle (LKP). This symmetry leads to two fixed points.
In non-minimal versions of UED boundary-localised terms (BLT) for different
fields are included at these fixed points and KK-parity may be violated.
However, BLTs with same strength at both points induce a new Z_2 symmetry which
restores the stability of the LKP. We show that the BLTs serve to relax the
bounds set on the compactification scale in UED by the dark matter relic
density requirement. At the same time, the precision of the dark matter
measurements severely correlates the BLT parameters of gauge bosons and
fermions. Depending on the parameter values, the LKP can be chosen to be the
level-1 photon, which is essentially the B^(1), or the level-1 Z-boson,
basically the W_3^(1). We find that in the latter case the relic density is too
small for a W_3^(1) with a \sim 1 TeV mass. We also explore the prospects of
direct detection of an LKP which matches the observed dark matter relic
density.

observed matter distribution? To answer this, we need a relativistic approach
that goes beyond the standard Newtonian calculation and deals properly with
large scales. Such an approach has recently been developed for the case when
dark energy is vacuum energy, which does not cluster at all. We extend this
relativistic analysis to deal with dynamical dark energy. Using three
quintessence potentials as examples, we compute the angular power spectrum for
the case of an HI intensity map survey. Compared to the concordance model with
the same small-scale power at z=0, quintessence boosts the angular power by up
to ~15% at high redshifts, while power in the two models converges at low
redshifts. The difference is mainly due to the background evolution, driven
mostly by the normalization of the power spectrum today. The dark energy
perturbations make only a small contribution on the largest scales, and a
negligible contribution on smaller scales. Ironically, the dark energy
perturbations remove the false boost of large-scale power that arises if we
impose the (unphysical) assumption that the dark energy is smooth.

Differently from recent studies that describe inversion techniques, such as

modelled as an unknown number of current dipoles, whose state space is
described in terms of a variable--dimension model. Within the resulting
Bayesian framework, we set up a sequential Monte Carlo sampler to explore the
posterior distribution. An adaptation technique is employed in order to
effectively balance the computational cost and the quality of the sample
approximation. Then, both the number and the parameters of the unknown current
dipoles are simultaneously estimated. The performance of the method is assessed
by means of synthetic data, generated by source configurations containing up to
four dipoles. Eventually, we describe the results obtained by analyzing data

provides information that can lead to a better mechanistic understanding of an

selection is often performed with machine learning methods. The Random Forest
method is particularly well suited for this purpose. In this work, four
state-of-the-art Random Forest-based feature selection methods were compared in
a gene selection context. The analysis focused on the stability of selection
because, although it is necessary for determining the significance of results,
it is often ignored in similar studies.
  The comparison of post-selection accuracy in the validation of Random Forest
classifiers revealed that all investigated methods were equivalent in this
context. However, the methods substantially differed with respect to the number
of selected genes and the stability of selection. Of the analysed methods, the
Boruta algorithm predicted the most genes as potentially important.
  The post-selection classifier error rate, which is a frequently used measure,
was found to be a potentially deceptive measure of gene selection quality. When
the number of consistently selected genes was considered, the Boruta algorithm
was clearly the best. Although it was also the most computationally intensive
method, the Boruta algorithm's computational demands could be reduced to levels
comparable to those of other algorithms by replacing the Random Forest
importance with a comparable measure from Random Ferns (a similar but
simplified classifier). Despite their design assumptions, the minimal optimal
selection methods, were found to select a high fraction of false positives.

observations for more than 20 years indicates the so-called hemispheric sign
rule; the helicity is predominantly negative in the northern hemisphere and
positive in the southern hemisphere. In this paper we revisit this property and
compare the statistical distribution of current helicity with Gaussian
distribution using the method of normal probability paper. The data sample
comprises 6630 independent magnetograms obtained at Huairou Solar Observing
Station, China, over 1988-2005 which correspond to 983 solar active regions. We
found the following. (1) For the most of cases in time-hemisphere domains the
distribution of helicity is close to Gaussian. (2) At some domains (some years
and hemispheres) we can clearly observe significant departure of the
distribution from a single Gaussian, in the form of two- or multi-component
distribution. (3) For the most non-single-Gaussian parts of the dataset we see
co-existence of two or more components, one of which (often predominant) has a
mean value very close to zero, which does not contribute much to the
hemispheric sign rule. The other component has relatively large value of
helicity that often determines agreement or disagreement with the hemispheric
sign rule in accord with the global structure of helicity reported by Zhang et
al. (2010).

limit evolution is associated with dynamic brittle fracture and satisfies a
dynamic energy inequality expressed in terms of the kinetic energy of the

corresponds to the simultaneous evolution of elastic displacement and brittle
fracture with displacement fields satisfying the wave equation inside the
cracking domain. The wave equation provides the dynamic coupling between
elastic waves and the evolving fracture path inside the media. The elastic

partial wave channels including the isospin-singlet T=0 channel, the
isospin-triplet T=1 channel and the T=0 tensor 3SD1 channel have been
calculated. The T=0 neutron-proton correlations play a dominated role in
causing the depletion of nuclear Fermi sea. The T=0 correlation-induced

The isospin-singlet T=0 3SD1 tensor correlations is shown to response for most
of the depletion, which amounts to more than 70 percent out of the total
depletion in the density region considered. The TBF turns out to leads to an
enhancement of the depletion at high densities well above the empirical
saturation density and its effect increases as a function of density.

derive a generalized two-center interference condition for elliptically

within the strong-field and the single-active electron approximation. We show
that the non-vanishing ellipticity introduces an effective dynamic shift in the

regard to the existing condition for linearly polarized fields. This shift
depends on the ratio between the field-dressed momentum components of the
returning electron parallel and perpendicular to the major ellipticity axis

be a blurring in the two-center interference minima, and that increasing
ellipticity leads to splitting in such patterns. These features are

In this paper, after exhibiting a finite-horizon online throughput-maximizing

a dynamic programming formulation, a low complexity online scheduling policy is
proposed. The policy exploits the existence of thresholds for choosing rate and
power levels as a function of stored energy, harvest state and time until the
end of the horizon. The policy, which is based on computing an expected
threshold, performs close to optimal on a wide range of example energy harvest
patterns. Moreover, it achieves higher throughput values for a given delay,
than throughput-optimal online policies developed based on infinite-horizon
formulations in recent literature. The solution is extended to include ergodic
time-varying (fading) channels, and a corresponding low complexity policy is
proposed and evaluated for this case as well.

to be determined essentially by the tensor force from the $\pi$ meson and
$\rho$ meson exchanges via the $^3SD_1$ coupled channel. Increasing the
strength of the tensor component due to the $\rho$-meson exchange tends to
enhance the repulsion of the equation of state of symmetric nuclear matter and
leads to reduction of symmetry energy. The present results confirm the dominant

and a distance less than half the published distance that was determined on the
basis of interstellar sodium D line strengths.Truncated accretion disks with
truncation radii of 3Rwd and 5Rwd yielded unsatisfactory agreement with the COS
data. The accretion rate is unexpectedly low for a classical nova only 24 years
after the explosion when the accretion rate is expected to be high and the
white dwarf should still be very hot, especially if irradiation of the donor

is explored to derive a specific topological build-up for Planckian space-time.
The presented arguments are inspired by Feynman's path integral for
superposition and Wheeler's quantum foam of Planck mass mini black
holes/wormholes. Paths are fundamental and prime 3-manifolds like T^3, S^1xS^2
and S^3 are used to construct quantum space-time. A physical principle is
formulated that causes observed paths to multiply: It takes one to know one. So
topological fluctuations on the Planck scale take the form of multiple copies
of any homeomorphically distinct path through quantum space-time. The discrete
time equation of motion for this topological quantum gravity is derived by
counting distinct paths globally. The equation of motion is solved to derive
some properties of dark energy and inflation. The dark energy density depends
linearly on the number of macroscopic black holes in the universe and is time
dependent in a manner consistent with current astrophysical observations,
having an effective equation of state w=-1.1 for redshifts smaller than unity.
Inflation driven by mini black holes proceeds over n=55 e-foldings, without
strong inhomogeneity, a scalar-to-tensor ratio r=ln(7)/n=0.036 and a spectral
index n_s=1-r=0.964. A discrete time effect visible in the cosmic microwave
background is suggested.

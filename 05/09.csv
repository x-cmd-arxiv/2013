X-ray, and optically selected samples from COSMOS, we find that the locus of
type-2 AGN hosts in the optical colour-magnitude (U-V/V) and colour-colour
(U-V/V-J) space significantly overlaps with that of IR-luminous (L_IR > 10^10
L_sun) galaxies. Based on our observations, we propose that, when
simultaneously building their black hole and stellar masses, type-2 AGN hosts
are located in the same part of colour-colour space as dusty star-forming
galaxies. In fact, our results show that IR-luminous galaxies at z<1.5 are on
average 3 times more likely to host a type-2 AGN (L_X > 10^42 erg/s) than would
be expected serendipitously, if AGN and star-formation events were unrelated.
In addition, the optical and infrared properties of the AGN/SB hybrid systems
tentatively suggest that the AGN phase might be coeval with a particularly
active phase in a galaxy's star-formation history. Interestingly, we also find
a significant fraction of type-2 AGN hosts offset from the dusty galaxy
sequence in colour-colour space, possibly representing a transitional or
post-starburst phase in galaxy evolution. Our findings are consistent with a
scenario whereby AGN play a role in the termination of star-formation in
massive galaxies.

relative condition factor of each fish was computed using expected weight from
weight-length relationships from the Colorado Division of Parks and Wildlife

ecosystem were used to compute relative condition factors for additional
comparison, as was independent creel survey data from 2011. Cutthroat trout
were plump: the mean relative condition factor of the cutthroat trout was
112.0% (+/- 1.0%). Cutbow hybrid trout were close to the expected weights with
a mean relative condition factor of 99.8% (+/- 0.6%). Rainbow trout were
thinner with a mean relative condition factor of 96.4% (+/- 1.4%). Comparing
mean relative condition factors of CDPW data from earlier years and plotting
the 2012 data relative to percentile curves also shows the same trend of
cutthroat trout being plumper than expected and rainbow trout being thinner
than the cutthroat trout, with the hybrid cutbow trout in between. This data
supports the hypothesis that rainbow trout do not outcompete cutthroat trout in

value of the fine-structure constant, {\alpha}, measured today on Earth with
its value in distant galaxies. In recent years, some evidence has emerged of
small temporal and also spatial variations of {\alpha} on cosmological scales
which may reach a fractional level of ~ 10 ppm (parts per million). To test
these claims we are conducting a Large Program with the VLT UVES . We are
obtaining high-resolution (R ~ 60000 and high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N ~ 100)
UVES spectra calibrated specifically for this purpose. Here we analyse the
first complete quasar spectrum from this Program, that of HE 2217-2818. We
apply the Many Multiplet method to measure {\alpha} in 5 absorption systems
towards this quasar: zabs = 0.7866, 0.9424, 1.5558, 1.6279 and 1.6919. The most
precise result is obtained for the absorber at zabs = 1.6919 where 3 Fe II
transitions and Al II {\lambda}1670 have high S/N and provide a wide range of
sensitivities to {\alpha}. The absorption profile is complex, with several very
narrow features, and requires 32 velocity components to be fitted to the data.
Our final result for the relative variation in {\alpha} in this system is
Delta{\alpha}/{\alpha} = +1.3 +/- 2.4stat +/- 1.0sys ppm. This is one of the
tightest current bounds on {\alpha} variation from an individual absorber. The
absorbers towards quasar HE 2217-2818 reveal no evidence for variation in
{\alpha} at the 3 ppm precision level (1{\sigma} confidence). If the recently
reported 10 ppm dipolar variation of {\alpha} across the sky were correct, the
expectation at this sky position is (3.2-5.4) +/-1.7 ppm depending on dipole
model used . Our constraint of Delta{\alpha}/{\alpha}=+1.3+/-2.4stat +/-1.0sys
ppm is not inconsistent with this expectation.

While small dust particles are mainly affected by the aerodynamical coupling
with turbulent gas velocity fields, planetesimals and larger bodies are more
affected by gravitational interaction with gas density fluctuations. For the
latter process, a number of numerical simulations have been performed in recent
years, but a fully parameter-independent understanding has not been yet
established. In this study, we present simple scaling relations for the
planetesimal stirring rate in turbulence driven by magnetorotational
instability (MRI), taking into account the stabilization of MRI due to Ohmic
resistivity. We begin with order-of-magnitude estimates of the
turbulence-induced gravitational force acting on solid bodies and associated
diffusion coefficients for their orbital elements. We then test the predicted
scaling relations using the results of recent Ohmic-resistive MHD simulations
by Gressel et al. We find that these relations successfully explain the
simulation results if we properly fix order-of-unity uncertainties within the
estimates. We also update the saturation predictor for the density fluctuation
amplitude in MRI-driven turbulence originally proposed by Okuzumi & Hirose.
Combination of the scaling relations and saturation predictor allows to know
how the turbulent stirring rate of planetesimals depends on disk parameters
such as the gas column density, distance from the central star, vertical
resistivity distribution, and net vertical magnetic flux. In Paper II, we apply
our recipe to planetesimal accretion to discuss its viability in turbulent
disks.

growth phase. During runaway growth bodies in the 0.1--100 km size range
(planetesimals) quickly produce a number of much larger seeds. The runaway
growth phase is essential for planet formation as the emergent planetary
embryos can accrete the leftover planetesimals at large gravitational focusing
factors. However, torques resulting from turbulence-induced density
fluctuations may violate the criterion for the onset of runaway growth, which
is that the magnitude of the planetesimals' random (eccentric) motions are less
than their escape velocity. This condition represents a more stringent
constraint than the condition that planetesimals survive their mutual
collisions. To investigate the effects of MRI turbulence on the viability of
the runaway growth scenario, we apply our semi-analytical recipes of Paper I,
which we augment by a coagulation/fragmentation model for the dust component.
We find that the surface area-equivalent abundance of 0.1 micron particles is
reduced by factors 10^2--10^3, which tends to render the dust irrelevant to the
turbulence. We express the turbulent activity in the midplane regions in terms
of a size s_run above which planetesimals will experience runaway growth. We
find that s_run is mainly determined by the strength of the vertical net field
that threads the disks and the disk radius. At disk radii beyond 5 AU, s_run
becomes larger than ~100 km and the collision times among these bodies longer
than the duration of the nebula phase. Our findings imply that the classical,
planetesimal-dominated, model for planet formation is not viable in the outer
regions of a turbulent disk.

range. Effective radii measured for the ones lying on the ACS field are in the
range R_eff = 3 - 11 pc and are similar to equivalent objects in other
clusters, obtained from the literature. The UCD sample shares the same
behaviour on the size-luminosity plane: a linear relation between R_eff and M_V
is present for UCDs brighter than M_V ~ -10.5 - -11 mag while no trend is
detected for fainter ones, that have an approximately constant R_eff. The
projected spatial distribution of UCDs, GCs and X-ray emission points to an

98% of the total dust content of the galaxy, the rest can be represented by a
warmer dust component of 40 K. The bar exhibits an east-west asymmetry in the
dust distribution: The eastern bar is heavier than the western bar by more than
a factor of 4. Integrating the dust SED, we derive a total infrared (IR)
luminosity of 9.8 x 10^{10} L_{\odot} leading to a dust-enshrouded star

gas mass concentration is only ~20% at R<40"" (3.6 kpc). On the other hand, the

  - We show how this method achieves a faster asymptotic runtime than conjugate

  - We improve the best known asymptotic convergence guarantees for Kaczmarz

120119A. Our early-time afterglow detections began under 15 s after the burst
in the host frame (redshift z = 1.73), and they yield constraints on the burst
energetics and local environment. Late-time afterglow observations of the burst
show evidence for a moderate column of dust (A_V ~ 1.1 mag) similar to, but
statistically distinct from, dust seen along Small Magellanic Cloud sightlines.
Deep late-time observations reveal a dusty, rapidly star-forming host galaxy.
Most notably, our early-time observations exhibit a significant red-to-blue
colour change in the first ~200 s after the trigger at levels heretofore unseen
in GRB afterglows. This colour change, which is coincident with the final
phases of the prompt emission, is a hallmark prediction of the photodestruction
of dust in GRB afterglows. We test whether dust-destruction signatures are
significantly distinct from other sources of colour change, namely a change in
the intrinsic spectral index {\beta}. We find that a time-varying power-law
spectrum alone cannot adequately describe the observed colour change, and
allowing for dust destruction (via a time-varying A_V) significantly improves
the fit. While not definitively ruling out other possibilities, this event
provides the best support yet for the direct detection of dust destruction in
the local environment of a GRB.

bosons can be investigated using a model-independent input scheme based on
HiggsBounds. The test is based on the calculation of a chi-squared measure from
the predictions and the measured Higgs rates and masses, with the ability of
fully taking into account systematics and correlations for the signal rate
predictions, luminosity and Higgs mass predictions. It features two
complementary methods for the test. First, the peak-centered method, in which
each observable is defined by a Higgs signal rate measured at a specific
hypothetical Higgs mass, corresponding to a tentative Higgs signal. Second, the
mass-centered method, where the test is evaluated by comparing the signal rate
measurement to the theory prediction at the Higgs mass predicted by the model.
The program allows for the simultaneous use of both methods, which is useful in
testing models with multiple Higgs bosons. The code automatically combines the
signal rates of multiple Higgs bosons if their signals cannot be resolved by
the experimental analysis. We compare results obtained with HiggsSignals to
official ATLAS and CMS results for various examples of Higgs property
determinations and find very good agreement. A few examples of HiggsSignals
applications are provided, going beyond the scenarios investigated by the LHC

of the binary system 16 Cygni. Supporting infrared observations were made with
the Michigan Infrared Combiner (MIRC) and Classic beam combiner, also at the
CHARA Array. We find limb-darkened angular diameters of 0.753+/-0.009 mas for
{\theta} Cyg, 0.539+/-0.007 mas for 16 Cyg A and 0.490+/-0.006 mas for 16 Cyg

precision, revealing the presence of solar-like oscillations. Due to the
brightness of these stars the oscillations have exceptional signal-to-noise,
allowing for detailed study through asteroseismology, and are well constrained
by other observations. We have combined our interferometric diameters with
Hipparcos parallaxes, spectrophotometric bolometric fluxes and the
asteroseismic large frequency separation to measure linear radii ({\theta} Cyg:

A stream-orbit

discuss the expected magnitude of the misalignment and the resulting dangers of
using orbit-fitting algorithms to constrain the potential. We summarize data
for known streams which should prove useful for constraining the Galactic
potential, and compute their actions in a realistic Galactic potential. We go
on to discuss the formation of tidal streams in angle-action space, and explain
why, in general, streams do not delineate orbits. The magnitude of the
stream-orbit misalignment is quantified for a logarithmic potential and a
multi-component Galactic potential. Specifically, we focus on the expected
misalignment for the known streams. By introducing a two-parameter family of
realistic Galactic potentials we demonstrate that assuming these streams
delineate orbits can lead to order one errors in the halo flattening and
halo-to-disc force ratio at the Sun. We present a discussion of the dependence
of these results on the progenitor mass, and demonstrate that the misalignment
is mass-independent for the range of masses of observed streams. Hence,
orbit-fitting does not yield better constraints on the potential if one uses
narrower, lower-mass streams.

the missing satellites problem may be an indication that they are quite large.
In this paper, we use effective field theory to map constraints on dark
matter-SM interactions into limits on the mass of DM protohalos. Given that
leptons remain in the thermal bath until late times, we focus on their
interactions with DM. To illustrate the method, we use the null results of LEP
missing energy searches along with Fermi-LAT searches for DM annihilation in
nearby dwarf galaxies, to derive limits on the protohalo mass, $\lesssim
(10^{-6}-10^{-1}) M_{\odot}$, with the range depending on the DM mass and the
operator. Thus, if DM is to remain thermally coupled until late times and
account for the missing satellites, charged lepton interactions are
insufficient. This motivates neutrinophilic DM, which can have protohalo masses
orders of magnitude larger, with constraints arising from Planck, IceCube and
unpublished Super-K data. We show that effective neutrinophilic models offer a
solution to the missing satellites problem for sub-GeV DM masses with larger
than WIMP-sized annihilation cross sections.

This approach is independent of the progenitor mass so is valid for all
observed tidal streams. The method makes heavy use of angle-action variables
and seeks the potential which recovers the expected correlations in angle
space. We demonstrate that the method can correctly recover the parameters of a
simple two-parameter logarithmic potential by analysing an N-body simulation of
a stream. We investigate the magnitude of the errors in observational data for
which the method can still recover the correct potential and compare this to
current and future errors in data. The errors in the observables of individual
stars for current and near future data are shown to be too large for the direct
use of this method, but when the data are averaged in bins on the sky, the
resulting averaged data are accurate enough to constrain correctly the
potential parameters for achievable observational errors. From pseudo-data with
errors comparable to those that will be furnished in the era of Gaia (20 per
cent distance errors, 1.2 mas/yr proper motion errors, and 10 km/s
line-of-sight velocity errors) we recover the circular velocity, V_c=220 km/s,

spin-down power Edot = 5x10^33 erg/s, and characteristic age P/2Pdot = 9x10^3

especially during outburst. The flux and modulation remained steady during the

be formalized, either as Description Logic (DL) axioms or queries, enabling the
retrieval of the trajectories that follow the patterns.

Leveraging events, we have reconstructed almost 300 thousand container
trajectories referring to 50 thousand containers travelling along three years.
We have formalized the anomalous itinerary patterns as DL axioms, testing
different ontology APIs and DL reasoners to retrieve the suspicious

constantly improved. The discovery of few astrometric anomalies, such as the
Pioneer and Earth flyby anomalies, stimulated further analysis of the operative
modeling currently adopted in Deep Space Navigation (DSN). Our study shows that
some traditional approximations lead to neglect tiny terms that could have
consequences in the orbit determination of a probe in specific configurations
such as during an Earth flyby. Therefore, we suggest here a way to improve the
light time calculation used for probe tracking.

recently. Current observations suggest that most have long periods, on the
order of years, and that some are or once were hierarchical triple systems. As

radial velocities of several composite-spectra binaries since 2005 in order to
determine their periods, velocities, and eccentricities. Here we present
observations and orbital solutions for two of these systems, PG 1449+653 and PG

periods are long, 909 d and 734 d, respectively, and pose a challenge to
current binary population synthesis models of hot subdwarf stars. Intrigued by
their relatively large systemic velocities, we also present a kinematical
analysis of both targets and find that neither is likely a member of the

large-scale personalized learning systems that cater directly to the needs of
individual learners. The recently developed SPARse Factor Analysis (SPARFA)
framework provides a new statistical model and algorithms for machine
learning-based learning analytics, which estimate a learner's knowledge of the
latent concepts underlying a domain, and content analytics, which estimate the
relationships among a collection of questions and the latent concepts. SPARFA
estimates these quantities given only the binary-valued graded responses to a
collection of questions. In order to better interpret the estimated latent
concepts, SPARFA relies on a post-processing step that utilizes user-defined
tags (e.g., topics or keywords) available for each question. In this paper, we
relax the need for user-defined tags by extending SPARFA to jointly process
both graded learner responses and the text of each question and its associated
answer(s) or other feedback. Our purely data-driven approach (i) enhances the
interpretability of the estimated latent concepts without the need of
explicitly generating a set of tags or performing a post-processing step, (ii)
improves the prediction performance of SPARFA, and (iii) scales to large
test/assessments where human annotation would prove burdensome. We demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed approach on two real educational datasets.

science. However, its core claim, i.e. that the process of cognition can extend
beyond the brain via the body and into the environment, has been heavily
criticized. A prominent critique of this claim holds that when some part of the
world is coupled to a cognitive system this does not necessarily entail that
the part is also constitutive of that cognitive system. This critique is known
as the ""coupling-constitution fallacy"". In this paper we respond to this
reductionist challenge by using an evolutionary robotics approach to create a
minimal model of two acoustically coupled agents. We demonstrate how the
interaction process as a whole has properties that cannot be reduced to the
contributions of the isolated agents. We also show that the neural dynamics of
the coupled agents has formal properties that are inherently impossible for
those neural networks in isolation. By keeping the complexity of the model to
an absolute minimum, we are able to illustrate how the coupling-constitution
fallacy is in fact based on an inadequate understanding of the constitutive
role of nonlinear interactions in dynamical systems theory.

codimension-1 surfaces of unidirectional flux whose union, called a dividing
surface, locally separates the energy-level into two components and has no
local recrossings. For this to happen robustly to all smooth perturbations, the
transition state must be normally hyperbolic. The dividing surface then has
locally minimal geometric flux through it, giving an upper bound on the rate of
transport in either direction. Transition states diffeomorphic to $\mathbb

of a Hamiltonian of $m$ degrees of freedom, with dividing surfaces $\mathbb

energy or other parameters are varied? We find that there is a class of systems
for which the transition state becomes singular and then regains normal
hyperbolicity with a change in diffeomorphism class. These are Morse
bifurcations. Various examples are considered. Firstly, some simple examples in
which transition states connect or disconnect, and the dividing surface may
become a torus or other. Then, we show how sequences of Morse bifurcations

interactions, where two-particle repulsions between any two of the three colors
have different strengths. At half filling, two types of staggered ordered
states appear at low temperatures depending on the anisotropy of the

electromagnetic, and gravitational interactions, and fulfilling the global
charge neutrality of the system, a transition layer will happen between the
core and crust of neutron stars, at the nuclear saturation density. We use
relativistic mean field theory together with the Thomas-Fermi approximation to
study the detailed structure of this transition layer and calculate its surface
and Coulomb energy. We find that the surface tension is proportional to a
power-law function of the baryon number density in the core bulk region. We
also analyze the influence of the electron component and the gravitational
field on the structure of the transition layer and the value of the surface
tension to compare and contrast with known phenomenological results in nuclear
physics. Based on the above results we study the instability against
Bohr-Wheeler surface deformations in the case of neutron stars obeying global
charge neutrality. Assuming the core-crust transition at nuclear density
$\rho_{core}\approx 2.7 * 10^{14}$ g cm$^{-3}$, we find that the instability
sets the upper limit to the crust density, $\rho_{crust}^{crit}\approx 1.2 *
10^{14}$ g cm$^{-3}$. This result implies a nonzero lower limit to the maximum
electric field of the core-crust transition surface and makes inaccessible a
limit of quasilocal charge neutrality in the limit $\rho_{crust}=\rho_{core}$.
The general framework presented here can be also applied to study the stability
of sharp phase transitions in hybrid stars as well as in strange stars, both
bare and with outer crust. The results of this work open the way to a more
general analysis of the stability of these transition surfaces, accounting for
other effects such as gravitational binding, centrifugal repulsion, magnetic

sufficient to probe extremely large length scales in the universe, whilst at

product operation for one-round two-player games. In this framework, we
consider a relaxation of the value of a game, $\mathrm{val}_+$, and prove that
for projection games, it is both multiplicative (under parallel repetition) and
a good approximation for the true value.
  These two properties imply a parallel repetition bound as $$
\mathrm{val}(G^{\otimes k}) \approx \mathrm{val}_+(G^{\otimes k}) =
\mathrm{val}_+(G)^{k} \approx \mathrm{val}(G)^{k}. $$
  Using this framework, we can also give a short proof for the NP-hardness of
Label-Cover$(1,\delta)$ for all $\delta>0$, starting from the basic PCP
theorem.
  We prove the following new results:
  - A parallel repetition bound for projection games with small soundness.
Previously, it was not known whether parallel repetition decreases the value of
such games. This result implies stronger inapproximability bounds for Set-Cover
and Label-Cover.
  - An improved bound for few parallel repetitions of projection games, showing
that Raz's counterexample is tight even for a small number of repetitions.
  Our techniques also allow us to bound the value of the direct product of
multiple games, namely, a bound on $\mathrm{val}(G_1\otimes ...\otimes G_k)$
for different projection games $G_1,...,G_k$.

wide variety of ecological functions that ecosystems perform remains relatively
understudied, and it presents several analytical and empirical challenges that
remain unresolved. In particular, researchers have developed several disparate
metrics to quantify multifunctionality, each characterizing different aspects
of the concept, and each with pros and cons. We compare four approaches to
characterizing multifunctionality and its dependence on biodiversity,
quantifying 1) magnitudes of multiple individual functions separately, 2) the
extent to which different species promote different functions, 3) the average
level of a suite of functions, and 4) the number of functions that

such as humans, animals and machines, requires more general ways of assessing
their cognitive abilities. This need is strengthened by increasingly more tasks
being analysed for and completed by a wider diversity of systems, including
swarms and hybrids. The notion of universal test has recently emerged in the
context of machine intelligence evaluation as a way to define and use the same
cognitive test for a variety of systems, using some principled tasks and
adapting the interface to each particular subject. However, how far can
universal tests be taken? This paper analyses this question in terms of
subjects, environments, space-time resolution, rewards and interfaces. This
leads to a number of findings, insights and caveats, according to several
levels where universal tests may be progressively more difficult to conceive,

cloaked and cloaking regions. This might be of significant practical importance
when production fluctuations occur. Second, it allows the cloaked contents to
be both passive and active with an applied current inside. In assessing the

independent of the passive/active contents being cloaked, which implies that

to explain the horizontal branch (HB) morphology of globular clusters (GCs).
Furthermore, these parameters are considered to be correlated with the mass
loss of the red giant branch (RGB) stars. In our previous work, we proposed
that tidally enhanced stellar wind during binary evolution may affect the HB
morphology by enhancing the mass loss of the red giant primary. As a further
study, we now investigate the effects of metallicity and age on HB morphology
by considering tidally enhanced stellar winds during binary evolution. We
incorporated the tidally enhanced-stellar-wind model into Eggleton's stellar
evolution code to study the binary evolution. To study the effects of
metallicity and age on our final results, we conducted two sets of model
calculations: (i) for a fixed age, we used three metallicities, namely
Z=0.0001, 0.001, and 0.02. (ii) For a fixed metallicity, Z=0.001, we used five
ages in our model calculations: 14, 13, 12, 10, and 7 Gyr. We found that HB
morphology of GCs becomes bluer with decreasing metallicity, and old GCs
present bluer HB morphology than young ones. These results are consistent with
previous work. Although the envelope-mass distributions of zero-age HB stars
produced by tidally enhanced stellar wind are similar for different
metallicities, the synthetic HB under tidally enhanced stellar wind for Z=0.02
presented a distinct gap between red and blue HB. However, this feature was not
seen clearly in the synthetic HB for Z=0.001 and 0.0001. We also found that
higher binary fractions may make HB morphology become bluer, and we discussed
the results with recent observations.

stability analysis of fluid flows. As a test case that demonstrates the
framework we focus on the plane Couette flow. The incompressible Navier-Stokes
equation is recast such that the particle position is the fundamental variable,
expressed as a function of Lagrangian coordinates. The displacement due to the
steady state flow is taken to be the zeroth order solution and the position is
formally expanded in terms of a small parameter (generally, the strength of the
initial perturbation). The resulting hierarchy of equations is solved
analytically at first order. We find that we recover the standard result in the
Eulerian frame: the plane Couette flow is asymptotically stable for all
Reynolds numbers. However, it is also well established that experiments
contradict this prediction. In the Eulerian picture, one of the proposed
explanations is the phenomenon of `transient growth' which is related to the
non-normal nature of the linear stability operator. The first order solution in
the Lagrangian frame also shows this feature, albeit qualitatively. As a first
step, and for the purposes of analytic manipulation, we consider only linear
stability of 2D perturbations but the framework presented is general and can be
extended to higher orders, other flows and/or 3D perturbations.

sources are associated with the regions where the photon arrival directions
clusterize. MST selects clusters starting from a particular ""tree"" connecting
all the point of the image and performing a cut based on the angular distance
between photons, with a number of events higher than a given threshold. In this
paper, we show how a further filtering, based on some parameters linked to the
cluster properties, can be applied to reduce spurious detections. We find that
the most efficient parameter for this secondary selection is the magnitude M of
a cluster, defined as the product of its number of events by its clustering
degree. We test the sensitivity of the method by means of simulated and real
Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) fields. Our results show that sqrt(M) is
strongly correlated with other statistical significance parameters, derived
from a wavelet based algorithm and maximum likelihood (ML) analysis, and that
it can be used as a good estimator of statistical significance of MST

their overlapped showers in electromagnetic calorimeter is very important for
the reconstructions of some particles with hadronic decays, for example the tau
reconstruction in the searches for the Standard Model and supersymmetric Higgs
bosons at the LHC. In this paper, a method combining the shower cluster in
electromagnetic calorimeter and the parametric formula for hadron showers, was
developed to separate the overlapped showers between charged hadron and neutral
hadron. Taking the hadronic decay containing one charged pion and one neutral
pion in the final status of tau for example, satisfied results of the
separation of the overlapped showers, the reconstructions of the energy and
positions of the hadrons were obtained. An improved result for the tau
reconstruction with this decay model can be also achieved after the application
of the proposed method.

could importantly impact variable selection and large network inference
methods. In this paper, we propose a new statistical coefficient that we call
the rank minrelation coefficient. We define a minrelation of X to Y (or
equivalently a majrelation of Y to X) as a measure that estimate p(Y > X) when
X and Y are continuous random variables. The approach is similar to Lin's
concordance coefficient that rather focuses on estimating p(X = Y). In other
words, if a variable X exhibits a minrelation to Y then, as X increases, Y is
likely to increases too. However, on the contrary to concordance or
correlation, the minrelation is not symmetric. More explicitly, if X decreases,
little can be said on Y values (except that the uncertainty on Y actually
increases). In this paper, we formally define this new kind of bivariate
dependencies and propose a new statistical coefficient in order to detect those
dependencies. We show through several key examples that this new coefficient
has many interesting properties in order to select relevant variables, in
particular when compared to correlation.

experimental evaluation of these algorithms in the context of balance control
for a humanoid robot. The presented experiments demonstrate the applicability
of the approach under real robot conditions (i.e. model uncertainty, estimation

allows us to decrease computation time enough to implement it in a fast torque
control loop. We implement a momentum-based balance controller which shows
robust performance in face of unknown disturbances, even when the robot is
standing on only one foot. In a second experiment, a tracking task is evaluated
to demonstrate the performance of the controller with more complicated
hierarchies. Our results show that hierarchical inverse dynamics controllers
can be used for feedback control of humanoid robots and that momentum-based
balance control can be efficiently implemented on a real robot.

revealed an unusually rich absorption spectrum with outflow velocities, in both
RGS and EPIC spectra, up to ~ 9000 km/s (Pounds and Vaughan 2011). Evidence was
again seen for a fast ionised wind with velocity ~ 0.12c (Tombesi 2010, Pounds
and Vaughan 2012). Detailed modelling with the XSTAR photoionisation code now
confirms the general correlation of velocity and ionisation predicted by mass
conservation in a Compton-cooled shocked wind (King 2010). We attribute the
strong column density gradient in the model to the addition of strong two-body
cooling in the later stages of the flow, causing the ionisation (and velocity)
to fall more quickly, and confining the lower ionisation gas to a narrower
region. The column density and recombination timescale of the highly ionised
flow component, seen mainly in Fe K lines, determine the primary shell
thickness which, when compared with the theoretical Compton cooling length,
determines a shock radius of ~ 10^17 cm. Variable radiative recombination
continua (RRC) provide a key to scaling the lower ionisation gas, with the RRC
flux then allowing a consistency check on the overall flow geometry. We
conclude that the 2009 observation of NGC 4051 gives strong support to the idea
that a fast, highly ionised wind, launched from the vicinity of the
supermassive black hole, will lose much of its mechanical energy after shocking
against the ISM at a sufficiently small radius for strong Compton cooling.
However, the total flow momentum will be conserved, retaining the potential for
a powerful AGN wind to support momentum-driven feedback (King 2003; 2005). We
speculate that the `warm absorber' components often seen in AGN spectra result
from accumulation of shocked wind and ejected ISM.

through side-coupled double quantum dot (QD) based on an efficient
particle-number-resolved master equation. It is demonstrated that the
high-order cumulants of transport current are more sensitive to the quantum
coherence than the average current, which can be used to probe the quantum
coherence of the considered double QD system. Especially, the quantum coherence
plays a crucial role in determining whether the super-Poissonian noise occurs
in the weak inter-dot hopping coupling regime depending on the corresponding
dot-lead coupling, and the corresponding values of super-Poissonian noise can
be relatively enhanced when considering the spins of conduction electrons.
Moreover, this super-Poissonian noise bias range depends on the singly-occupied
eigenstates of the system, which thus suggests a tunable super-Poissonian noise
device. The occurrence-mechanism of super-Poissonian noise can be understood in
terms of the interplay of quantum coherence and effective competition between
fast-and-slow transport channels.

Two repulsive $\delta$-interactions are compatible with massless fluctuations.

strengths in terms of Q, in the near-horizon Bertotti-Robinson black hole

its vertices can be ordered in such a way that the neighbours to the right of
any vertex v have at most a neighbours to the left of v in total. Examples of
arrangeable graphs include planar graphs and, more generally, graphs without a

past 100,000 years, including a severe bottleneck of non-African populations
and recent explosive population growth. There is currently great interest in
how these demographic events may have affected the burden of deleterious
mutations in individuals and the allele frequency spectrum of disease mutations
in populations. Here we use population genetic models to show that--contrary to
previous conjectures--recent human demography has likely had very little impact
on the average burden of deleterious mutations carried by individuals. This
prediction is supported by exome sequence data showing that African American
and European American individuals carry very similar burdens of damaging
mutations. We next consider whether recent population growth has increased the
importance of very rare mutations in complex traits. Our analysis predicts that
for most classes of disease variants, rare alleles are unlikely to contribute a
large fraction of the total genetic variance, and that the impact of recent
growth is likely to be modest. However, for diseases that have a direct impact
on fitness, strongly deleterious rare mutations likely do play important roles,
and the impact of very rare mutations will be far greater as a result of recent
growth. In summary, demographic history has dramatically impacted patterns of
variation in different human populations, but these changes have likely had
little impact on either genetic load or on the importance of rare variants for
most complex traits.

sunspot areas, flare index, magnetic fields, etc., allows us to investigate the
time evolution of some specific features of the solar activity and the
underlying dynamo mechanism. The main aim of this work is the analysis of the
time-frequency behavior of some magnetic strengtht indices currently taken at
the Mt. Wilson Observatory 150-Foot Solar Tower. In particular, we analyzed
both the long time series (Jan 19, 1970 - Jan 22, 2013) of the Magnetic Plage
Strength Index (MPSI) values and of the Mt. Wilson Sunspot Index (MWSI) values,
covering the descending phase of cycle 20, the full solar cycles 21-23 and the
current part of the 24 solar cycle. This study is a further contribution to
detect the changes in the multiscale quasiperiodic variations in the integrated
magnetic solar activity with a comparison between past solar cycles and the
current one, which is one of the weaker recorded in the past 100 years. Indeed,
it is well known that an unusual and deep solar minimum occurred between solar
cycles 23 and 24 and the time-frequency behavior of some magnetic strengtht
indices can help to better interpret the responsible mechanisms.

is not possible to stabilize the one-step (1RSB) solution beyond the marginal
point by making a full RSB (FRSB) ansatz. However, depending on the model, it
may exist a temperature $T_*$ strictly lower than $T_d$ below which the 1RSB
branch can be continued to a FRSB branch. Such a temperature certainly exists
for models that display the so-called Gardner transition and in this case
$T_G<T_*<T_d$. An analytical study in the context of the truncated model
reveals that the FRSB branch of solutions below $T_*$ is characterized by a two
plateau structure and it ends where the first plateau disappears. These general
features are confirmed in the context of the Ising $p$-spin with $p=3$ by means
of a numerical solution of the FRSB equations. The results are discussed in
connection with off-equilibrium dynamics within Cugliandolo-Kurchan theory. In
this context I assume that the RSB solution relevant for off-equilibrium
dynamics is the 1RBS marginal solution in the whole range $(T_*,T_d)$ and it is
the end-point of the FRSB branch for $T<T_*$. Remarkably under these

assessing how well large scale helical field growth and saturation in

progress. Using numerical simulations of isotropically forced turbulence
without large scale shear with the implications, we focus on several aspects of
this comparison that have not been previously tested: (1) Leading mean field
dynamo theories which break the field into large and small scales predict that
large scale helical field growth rates are determined by the difference between
kinetic helicity and current helicity with no dependence on the non-helical
energy in small scale magnetic fields. Our simulations show that the growth
rate of the large scale field from fully helical forcing is indeed unaffected
by the presence or absence of small scale magnetic fields amplified in a
precursor non-helical dynamo. However, because the precursor non helical dynamo
in our simulations produced fields that were strongly sub-equipartition with
respect to the kinetic energy, we cannot yet rule out the potential influence
of stronger non- helical small scale fields. (2) We have identified two
features in our simulations which cannot be explained by the most minimalist
versions of two-scale mean field theory: (i) fully helical small scale forcing
produces significant non-helical large scale magnetic energy and (ii) the
saturation of the large scale field growth is time-delayed with respect to what
minimalist theory predicts. We comment on desirable generalizations to the
theory in this context and future desired work.

variational approach to dissipative systems allows mathematically consistent
treatment of bio-ions Na, K, Ca and Cl as they interact and flow. Interactions
produce large excess free energy that dominate the properties of the high
concentration of ions in and near protein active sites, channels, and nucleic
acids: the number density of ions is often more than 10 M. Ions in such crowded
quarters interact strongly with each other as well as with the surrounding
protein. Non-ideal behavior has classically been ascribed to allosteric
interactions mediated by protein conformation changes. Ion-ion interactions
present in crowded solutions--independent of conformation changes of
proteins--are likely to change interpretations of allosteric phenomena.
Computation of all atoms is a popular alternative to the multiscale approach.
Such computations involve formidable challenges. Biological systems exist on
very different scales from atomic motion. Biological systems exist in ionic
mixtures (extracellular/intracellular solutions), and usually involve flow and
trace concentrations of messenger ions (e.g., 10-7 M Ca2+). Energetic
variational methods can deal with these characteristic properties of biological
systems while we await the maturation and calibration of all atom simulations
of ionic mixtures and divalents.

papers, utilizing in doing so a considerably more transparent formalism than
originally utilized. The most fundamental result to which we pay especial
attention in this paper, is that the exact Fermi surface (FS) of the uniform
metallic ground state (GS) of any single-band Hamiltonian, describing fermions,
is a subset of the FS within the framework of the exact Hartree-Fock theory. We
also review some of the physical implications of the latter result. Our
considerations reveal that the interacting FS of a uniform metallic GS cannot
be calculated exactly to order \nu (\nu \ge 2) in the coupling constant \lambda
of the interaction potential in terms of the self-energy calculated to order
\nu in a non-self-consistent fashion. We show this to be interlinked with the
failure of the Luttinger-Ward identity, and thus of the Luttinger theorem, for
a self-energy that is not appropriately related to the single-particle Green
function from which the FS is deduced. We further show that the same mechanism
that embodies the Luttinger theorem within the framework of the exact theory,
accounts for a non-trivial dependence of the exact self-energy on \lambda that
cannot be captured within a non-self-consistent framework. We thus establish
that the extant calculations that purportedly prove deformation of the
interacting FS of the metallic GS of the single-band Hubbard Hamiltonian with
respect to its Hartree-Fock counterpart at the second order in the on-site
interaction energy U, are fundamentally deficient. In an appendix we show that
the number-density distribution function, to be distinguished from the
site-occupation distribution function, corresponding to the GS of the Hubbard
Hamiltonian is not non-interacting v-representable, a fact established earlier
numerically. [Abridged Abstract]

The ZWA uncertainty is expected to be of O(Gamma/M), where M and Gamma are the
mass and width of the unstable particle. We review the ZWA and demonstrate that
errors can be much larger than expected if a significant modification of the
Breit-Wigner lineshape occurs. A thorough examination of the recently

the 1% precision level. For gg -> H -> VV, V = W,Z, O(5-10%) corrections occur
due to an enhanced Higgs signal in the region M_VV > 2 M_V, where also sizable

an out-of-plane magnetization of Mn atoms. However, since HgMnTe quantum wells
are paramagnetic, an out-of-plane magnetic field is required to polarize
magnetic moments of Mn atoms, which inevitably induces Landau levels and makes
it difficult to identify the origin of the quantized Hall conductance
experimentally. In this work, we study the quantum anomalous Hall effect in the
presence of an in-plane magnetic field in Mn doped HgTe quantum wells. For a
small out-of-plane magnetic field, the in-plane magnetic field can drive the
system from a normal insulating state to a quantum anomalous Hall state. When
the out-of-plane magnetic field is slightly above the transition point, the
system shows a reentrant behavior of Hall conductance, varying from $-e^2/h$ to
0 and back to $-e^2/h$, with increasing in-plane magnetic fields. The reentrant
quantum anomalous Hall effect originates from the interplay between the
exchange coupling of magnetic moments and the direct Zeeman coupling of
magnetic fields. The calculation incorporating Landau levels shows that there
is no qualitative change of the reentrant behavior.

order to investigate the evolution and fate of nearby very massive stars, we
calculated a new grid of models for such objects, for solar, LMC and SMC
metallicities, which covers the initial mass range from 120 to 500M. Both
rotating and non-rotating models were calculated using the Geneva stellar
evolution code and evolved until at least the end of helium burning and for
most models until oxygen burning. Since very massive stars have very large
convective cores during the Main-Sequence phase, their evolution is not so much
affected by rotational mixing, but more by mass loss through stellar winds.
Their evolution is never far from a homogeneous evolution even without
rotational mixing. All the VMS, at all the metallicities studied here, end
their life as WC(WO) type stars. At solar metallicity, none of our models is
expected to explode as a PCSN. At the metallicity of the LMC, only stars more
massive than 300 M are expected to explode as PCSNe. At the SMC metallicity,
the mass range for the PCSN progenitors is much larger and comprises stars with
initial masses between about 100 and 290 M . All VMS stars in the metallicity
range studied here produce either a type Ib or a type Ic SN. We estimate that
the progenitor of SN2007bi, assuming a SMC metallicity, had an initial mass
between 160 and 175 M . None of models presented in this grid produce GRBs or
magnetars. They lose too much angular momentum by mass loss or avoid the
formation of a BH by producing a completely disruptive PCSN.

approximation are revisited for an arbitrary spherically-symmetric electron-ion
interaction potential. The B2 phase shifts and scattering amplitudes are then
used to derive the Friedel sum rule (FSR) involving the second-order Born
corrections. This results in a simple equation for the B2 perturbative
screening parameter of an impurity ion immersed in a fully degenerate electron
gas which, as expected, turns out to depend on the ion atomic number $Z_{1}$
unlike the first-order Born (B1) screening parameter reported earlier by some
authors. Furthermore, our analytical results for the Yukawa, hydrogenic,
Hulth\'{e}n, and Mensing potentials are compared, for both positive and
negative ions and a wide range of one-electron radii, to the exact screening
parameters calculated self-consistently by imposing the FSR requirement. It is
shown that the B2 screening parameters agree excellently with the exact values
at large and moderate densities of the degenerate electron gas, while at lower
densities they progressively deviate from the exact numerical solutions but are
nevertheless more accurate than the prediction of the B1 approximation. In
addition, a simple Pad\'{e} approximant to the Born series has been developed
that improves the performance of the perturbative FSR for any negative ion as
well as for $Z_{1}=+1$.

  We say that a ring $R$ is special clean (special almost clean) if each

  Finally, we adapt some of our results to rings with involution: a *-ring is
*-clean (almost *-clean) if each of its elements is the sum of a unit (regular
element) and a projection (self-adjoint idempotent). A special (almost) *-clean
ring is similarly defined by replacing ``idempotent'' with ``projection'' in

$N_S(m,n)\geq N_S(m+1,n)$ for sufficiently large $n$ and fixed $m$. In this

Although a smaller signal, this effect is more abundant in minor mergers where
infalling substructure dark matter and gas are segregated. In such low-mass
systems the gravitational lensing signal comes primarily from weak lensing. A
fundamental step in determining such an offset in sub- structure is the ability
to accurately measure the positions of dark matter sub-peaks. Using simulated
Hubble Space Telescope observations, we make a first assessment of the
precision and accuracy with which we can measure infalling groups using weak
gravitational lensing. We demonstrate that using an existing and well-used mass
re- construction algorithm can measure the positions of 1.5x1013 M
substructures that have parent halos ten times more massive with a bias of less

thermal equilibrium, as expected. For a large enough initial phase-space

downlink channel, where the users are to receive the same data stream
simultaneously. This problem, known as physical-layer multicasting, has drawn
much interest. Presently, a popularized approach is transmit beamforming, in
which the beamforming optimization is handled by a rank-one approximation
method called semidefinite relaxation (SDR). SDR-based beamforming has been
shown to be promising for a small or moderate number of users. This paper
describes two new transceiver strategies for physical-layer multicasting. The
first strategy, called stochastic beamforming (SBF), randomizes the beamformer
in a per-symbol time-varying manner, so that the rank-one approximation in SDR
can be bypassed. We propose several efficiently realizable SBF schemes, and
prove that their multicast achievable rate gaps with respect to the MISO
multicast capacity must be no worse than 0.8314 bits/s/Hz, irrespective of any
other factors such as the number of users. The use of channel coding and the
assumption of sufficiently long code lengths play a crucial role in achieving
the above result. The second strategy combines transmit beamforming and the
Alamouti space-time code. The result is a rank-two generalization of SDR-based
beamforming. We show by analysis that this SDR-based beamformed Alamouti scheme
has a better worst-case effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scaling, and
hence a better multicast rate scaling, than SDR-based beamforming. We further
the work by combining SBF and the beamformed Alamouti scheme, wherein an
improved constant rate gap of 0.39 bits/s/Hz is proven. Simulation results show
that under a channel-coded, many-user setting, the proposed multicast
transceiver schemes yield significant SNR gains over SDR-based beamforming at
the same bit error rate level.

quadratic. The general system appears to admit separation of variables only in
Cartesian coordinates. Special cases where separation occurs in both Cartesian
and parabolic coordinates are considered. In the latter case the wavefunctions
satisfy the biconfluent Heun equation and depend on a transcendental separation
constant.

promise, with high sensitivity conferred by the reduced dimensionality and
exceptional electronic properties of the NT. Critical challenges in the
development of NT-based sensor arrays for chemical detection include the
demonstration of reproducible fabrication methods and functionalization schemes
that provide high chemical diversity to the resulting sensors. Here, we outline
a scalable approach to fabricating arrays of vapor sensors consisting of NT
field effect transistors functionalized with single-stranded DNA (DNA-NT).
DNA-NT sensors were highly reproducible, with responses that could be described
through equilibrium thermodynamics. Target analytes were detected even in large
backgrounds of volatile interferents. DNA-NT sensors were able to discriminate
between highly similar molecules, including structural isomers and enantiomers.
The sensors were also able to detect subtle variations in complex vapors,
including mixtures of structural isomers and mixtures of many volatile organic
compounds characteristic of humans.

observations of the G2 gas cloud near Sgr A* with the X-Ray Telescope to
determine whether the cloud interaction leads to an increase in the flux from
the Galactic center. On 2013 April 24 Swift detected an order of magnitude rise
in the X-ray flux from the region near Sgr A*. Initially thought to be a flare
from Sgr A*, detection of a short hard X-ray burst from the same region by the
Burst Alert Telescope suggested that the flare was from an unresolved new Soft
Gamma Repeater, SGR J1745-29. Here we present the discovery of SGR J1745-29 by
Swift, including analysis of data before, during, and after the burst. We find
that the spectrum in the 0.3-10 keV range is well fit by an absorbed blackbody
model with kTBB ~ 1 keV and absorption consistent with previously measured
values from the quiescent emission from Sgr A*, strongly suggesting that this
source is at a similar distance. Only one SGR burst has been detected so far
from the new source, and the persistent light curve shows little evidence of
decay in approximately 2 weeks of monitoring after outburst. We discuss this
light curve trend and compare it with those of other well covered SGR
outbursts. We suggest that SGR J1745-29 belongs to an emerging subclass of
magnetars characterized by low burst rates and prolonged steady X-ray emission
1-2 weeks after outburst onset.

dense interstellar clouds. The observations consist of data at several
wavelengths but of variable resolution. We examine two procedures that been
proposed for the estimation of high resolution N maps. Method A uses a
low-resolution temperature map combined with higher resolution intensity data
while Method B combines N estimates from different wavelength ranges. Our aim
is to determine the accuracy of the methods relative to the true column
densities and the estimates obtainable with radiative transfer modelling. We
use magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations and radiative transfer calculations
to simulate sub-millimetre observations at the wavelengths of the Herschel
Space Observatory. The observations are analysed with the methods and the
results compared to the true values and to the results from radiative transfer
modelling of observations. Both methods A and B give relatively reliable column
density estimates at the resolution of 250um data while also making use of the
longer wavelengths. For high signal-to-noise data, the results of Method B are
better correlated with the true column density, while Method A is less
sensitive to noise. When the cloud has internal heating, results of Method B
are consistent with those that would be obtained with high-resolution data.
Because of line-of-sight temperature variations, these underestimate the true
column density and, because of a favourable cancellation of errors, Method A
can sometimes give more correct values. Radiative transfer modelling, even with
very simple 3D cloud models, can provide better results. However, the
complexity of the models required for improvements increases rapidly with the
complexity and opacity of the clouds.

interstellar clouds and dust. Noise can produce anticorrelation between the
colour temperature T_C and the spectral index beta. This must be separated from
the intrinsic beta(T) relation of dust. We compare methods for the analysis of
the beta(T) relation. We examine sub-millimetre observations simulated as
simple modified black body emission or using 3D radiative transfer modelling.
In addition to chi^2 fitting, we examine the results of the SIMEX method, basic
Bayesian model, hierarchical models, and one method that explicitly assumes a
functional form for beta(T). All methods exhibit some bias. Bayesian method
shows significantly lower bias than direct chi^2 fits. The same is true for
hierarchical models that also result in a smaller scatter in the temperature
and spectral index values. However, significant bias was observed in cases with
high noise levels. Beta and T estimates of the hierarchical model are biased
towards the relation determined by the data with the highest S/N ratio. This
can alter the recovered beta(T) function. With the method where we explicitly
assume a functional form for the beta(T) relation, the bias is similar to the
Bayesian method. In the case of an actual Herschel field, all methods agree,
showing some degree of anticorrelation between T and beta.
  The Bayesian method and the hierarchical models can both reduce the
noise-induced parameter correlations. However, all methods can exhibit
non-negligible bias. This is particularly true for hierarchical models and
observations of varying signal-to-noise ratios and must be taken into account
when interpreting the results.

  (2013)","10.1016/j.shpsb.2013.03.001",,"quant-ph gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  According to Penrose, the fundamental conflict between the superposition
principle of quantum mechanics and the principle of general covariance of
general relativity entails the existence of wavefunction collapse, e.g. a
quantum superposition of two different space-time geometries will collapse to
one of them due to the ill-definedness of the time-translation operator for the
superposition. In this paper, we argue that Penrose's conjecture on gravity's
role in wavefunction collapse is debatable. First of all, it is still a
controversial issue what the exact nature of the conflict is and how to resolve
it. Secondly, Penrose's argument by analogy is too weak to establish a
necessary connection between wavefunction collapse and the conflict as
understood by him. Thirdly, the conflict does not necessarily lead to
wavefunction collapse. For the conflict or the problem of ill-definedness for a
superposition of different space-time geometries also needs to be solved before
the collapse of the superposition finishes, and once the conflict has been
resolved, the wavefunction collapse will lose its physical basis relating to
the conflict. In addition, we argue that Penrose's suggestions for the collapse
time formula and the preferred basis are also problematic.

noise has to be removed from the noisy speech signal to increase the signal
intelligibility and to reduce the listener fatigue. Enhancement techniques

recognition results. In this paper, a novel approach is used to enhance the
perceived quality of the speech signal when the additive noise cannot be

reinforce the speech signal so that it can be heard more clearly in noisy
environments. The subjective evaluation shows that the proposed method improves
perceptual quality of speech in various noisy environments. As in some cases
speaking may be more convenient than typing, even for rapid typists: many

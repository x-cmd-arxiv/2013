  purine A, keeps HTLV away","Initially submitted to the Journal of Theoretical Biology 27th
  November 2012","Microbes and Infection (2014) 16, 96-103","10.1016/j.micinf.2013.10.017",,"q-bio.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Extreme enrichment of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) RNA genome for
the purine A parallels the mild purine-loading of the RNAs of most organisms.
This should militate against loop-loop ""kissing"" interactions between the
structured viral genome and structured host RNAs, which can generate segments
of double-stranded RNA sufficient to trigger intracellular alarms. However,
human T cell leukaemia virus (HTLV-1), with the potential to invade the same
host cell, shows extreme enrichment for the pyrimidine C. Assuming the low GC%
HIV and the high GC% HTLV-1 to share a common ancestor, it was postulated that
differences in GC% arose to prevent homologous recombination between these
emerging lentiviral species. Sympatrically isolated by this intracellular
reproductive barrier, prototypic HIV-1 seized the AU-rich (low GC%) high ground
(thus committing to purine A rather than purine G). Prototypic HTLV-1 forwent
this advantage and evolved an independent evolutionary strategy. Evidence
supporting this hypothesis since its elaboration in the 1990s is growing. The
conflict between the needs to encode accurately both a protein, and nucleic
acid structure, is often resolved in favour of the nucleic acid because, apart
from regulatory roles, structure is critical for recombination. However, above
a sequence difference threshold, structure (and hence recombination) is
impaired. New species can then arise.

nonlinear threshold models are studied. Such systems are characterized by
intermittent behavior, where slow buildup of energy is punctuated by an abrupt
release of energy through avalanche events which usually follow scale invariant
statistics. From the simulations of these systems it is possible to extract
sequences of record-breaking avalanches, where each subsequent record-breaking
event is larger in magnitude than all previous events. In the present work,
several cellular automata are analyzed among them the sandpile model, Manna
model, Olami-Feder-Christensen (OFC) model, and the forest-fire model to
investigate the record-breaking statistics of model avalanches which exhibit
temporal and spatial correlations. Several statistical measures of
record-breaking events are derived analytically and confirmed through numerical
simulations. The statistics of record-breaking avalanches for the four models
are compared to that of record-breaking events extracted from the sequences of
independent identically distributed (\emph{i.i.d.}) random variables. It is
found that the statistics of record-breaking avalanches for the above cellular
automata exhibit behavior different from that observed for \emph{i.i.d.} random
variables which in turn can be used to characterize complex spatio-temporal
dynamics. The most pronounced deviations are observed in the case of the OFC
model with a strong dependence on the conservation parameter of the model. This
indicates that avalanches in the OFC model are not independent and exhibit
spatio-temporal correlations.

origin is the tensile stress that they collectively generate in actin
filaments. Here, we use a statistical mechanical analysis to investigate the
influence of the EMC effect on the sarcomere - the basic contractile unit of
skeletal muscles. We demonstrate that the EMC effect leads to an increase in
the attachment probability of motors located near the end of the sarcomere
while, simultaneously, decreasing the attachment probability of the motors in
the central part. Such a polarized attachment probability would impair the
motors ability to cooperate efficiently. Interestingly, this undesired
phenomenon becomes significant only when the system size exceeds that of the
sarcomere in skeletal muscles, which provides an explanation for the remarkable
lack of sarcomere variability in vertebrates. Another phenomenon that we
investigate is the recently observed increase in the duty ratio of the motors
with the tension in muscle. We reveal that the celebrated Hill's equation for
muscle contraction is very closely related to this observation.

of radial structure. They suggest that the inner region of the jet, the jet
spine, consists of a low-density, fast-moving gas, while the outer region of
the jet consists of a more dense and slower moving gas, called the jet sheath.
Moreover, if jets carry angular momentum, the resultant centrifugal forces lead
to a radial stratification. Current observations are not able to fully resolve
the radial structure, so little is known about its actual profile. We present
three AGN jet models in $2.5D$ of which two have been given a radial structure.
The first model is a homogeneous jet, the only model that doesn't carry angular
momentum; the second model is a spine-sheath jet with an isothermal equation of
state; and the third jet model is a (piecewise) isochoric spine-sheath jet,
with constant but different densities for jet spine and jet sheath. In this
paper, we look at the effects of radial stratification on jet integrity, mixing
between the different jet components and global morphology of the jet-head and
surrounding cocoon.

located in the district of Barranco, Miraflores and Magdalena, province of
Lima, Peru. These springs emerge near the shoreline, from the lower layers of a
80 meter high cliff. They have survived the process of urbanization of
agricultural land, started in the early 70, which decreased the water table
aquifer of Lima, and wiped the water leaks from the cliffs. To identify the
source of the springs, isotopic, physical, chemical and bacteriological
analysis was carried out for samples from five springs. The isotopic
concentrations in waters from Costa Verde springs are depleted compared to
those obtained for Lima aquifer waters, which is recharged by infiltration of
the Rimac River. The measured values of those concentrations suggest that water
from the Costa Verde springs should come from a direct recharge in the upper
and middle basin, due to infiltration of rainfall or the river at an altitude
of about 3600 m. Conductivity and temperature, measured in situ, are similar to
those obtained on Lima aquifers. The laboratory analysis showed no significant
levels of total or fecal coliform, discarding possible leakage from Lima
sewerage.

of the convection zone until the post-emergence phases. The global nature of
this model represents very crudely and inaccurately the local dynamics of the
buoyant rise, but allows to study the influence of global effects such as
self-consistently generated differential rotation, meridional circulation and
Coriolis forces. Although motivated by the solar context, this model cannot be
thought of as a realistic model of the rise of magnetic structures and their
emergence in the Sun where the local dynamics are completely different. The
properties of initial phases of the buoyant rise in good agreement with
previous studies. However, the effects of the interaction of the background
dynamo field become increase as the flux-ropes evolve. During the buoyant rise
across the CZ, the flux-rope's magnetic field strength and scales as $rho^a$,
with $a\lesssim 1$. An increase of velocity, density and current precedes flux
emergence at all longitudes. The geometry, latitude and relative orientation of
the flux-ropes with respect to the background magnetic field influences the
rise speeds, zonal flow amplitudes (which develop within the flux-ropes) and
the corresponding surface signatures. This influences the morphology, duration
and amplitude of the associated surface shearing and Poynting flux. The emerged
flux influences the system's global polarity, leading in some cases to a
polarity reversal while inhibiting background dynamo from doing so in some
others. The emerged magnetic flux is slowly advected poleward, while being
diffused and assimilated by the background dynamo field.

constant, H0) is derived here using the gamma-ray attenuation observed in the
spectra of gamma-ray sources produced by the interaction of extragalactic
gamma-ray photons with the photons of the extragalactic background light (EBL).
The Hubble constant that is determined with our technique, for a Lambda CDM
cosmology, is H0=71.8_{-5.6}^{+4.6}(stat)_{-13.8}^{+7.2}(syst) km s^{-1}
Mpc^{-1}. This value is compatible with present-day measurements using well
established methods such as local distance ladders and cosmological probes. The
recent detection of the cosmic gamma-ray horizon (CGRH) from multiwavelength
observation of blazars, together with the advances in the knowledge of the EBL,
allow us to measure the expansion rate of the Universe. This estimate of the
Hubble constant shows that gamma-ray astronomy has reached a mature enough
state to provide cosmological measurements, which may become more competitive
in the future with the construction of the Cherenkov Telescope Array. We find
that the maximum dependence of the CGRH on the Hubble constant is approximately
between redshifts 0.04 and 0.1, thus this is a smoking gun for planning future
observational efforts. Other cosmological parameters, such as the total dark

for refining the structures of hydrogen bonding networks to high accuracy with
many potential applications such as protein flexibility in ligand binding.

wave mixing in a uniform second- order nonlinear optical medium pumped by a
strong laser pulse. We find Green functions describing the process, and employ
Schmidt (singular- value) decompositions thereof to quantify its viability in
functioning as a coherent waveform discriminator. We define a selectivity
figure of merit in terms of the Schmidt coefficients, and use it to compare and
contrast various parameter regimes via extensive numerical computations. We
identify the most favorable regime (at least in the case of no pump chirp) and
derive the complete analytical solution for the same. We bound the maximum
achievable selectivity in this parameter space. We show that including a
frequency chirp in the pump does not improve selectivity in this optimal
regime. We also find an operating regime in which high-efficiency frequency
conversion without temporal-shape selectivity can be achieved while preserving
the shapes of a wide class of input pulses. The results are applicable to both
classical and quantum frequency conversion.

time propagators. We provide explicit construction of these propagators using a
forward model for wave propagation which depends non-linearly on the problem

extent of event, and the locations of the receivers. Under fairly general
assumptions and an appropriate discretization of these parameters we first
build an over-complete dictionary of generalized Radon propagators and assume
that the data is well represented as a linear superposition of these

absorption troughs from three important ions are measured: first, O IV and O
IV* that allow us to obtain the distance of high ionization outflows from the
AGN; second, Ne VIII and Mg X that are sensitive to the very high ionization
phase of the outflow. Their inferred column densities, combined with those of
troughs from O VI, N IV, and H I, yield two important results: 1) The outflow
shows two ionization phases, where the high ionization phase carries the bulk
of the material. This is similar to the situation seen in x-ray warm absorber
studies. Furthermore, the low ionization phase is inferred to have a volume
filling factor of 10^(-5)-10^(-6). 2) From the O IV to O IV* column density
ratio, and the knowledge of the ionization parameter, we determine a distance
of 3000 pc. from the outflow to the central source. Since this is a typical
high ionization outflow, we can determine robust values for the mass flux and
kinetic luminosity of the outflow: 40 solar masses per year and 10^45 ergs/s,
respectively, where the latter is roughly equal to 1% of the bolometric
luminosity. Such a large kinetic luminosity and mass flow rate measured in a
typical high ionization wind suggests that quasar outflows are a major

analytical description of the multipolar components of the absorption flux
through Taylor expansions in the orbital frequency. Building on previous work,
we construct a mode-by-mode factorization of the absorbed flux whose Taylor
expansion agrees with current PN results. This factorized form significantly
improves the agreement with numerical results obtained with a frequency-domain
Teukolsky code, which evolves through a sequence of circular orbits up to the
photon orbit. We perform the comparison between model and numerical data for
dimensionless Kerr spins $-0.99 \leq q \leq 0.99$ and for frequencies up to the
light ring of the Kerr black hole. Our proposed model enforces the presence of
a zero in the flux at an orbital frequency equal to the frequency of the
horizon, as predicted by perturbation theory. It also reproduces the expected
divergence of the flux close to the light ring. Neither of these features are
captured by the Taylor-expanded PN flux. Our proposed absorption flux can also
help improve models for the inspiral, merger, ringdown of small mass-ratio
binary systems.

the role of tidal forces in these systems. We show that tidal effects are

tracing the evolution of the fluid with time, and allowing the thermodynamical
history of individual fluid parcels to be recorded. We find that the
commonly-used `velocity field tracers', which are advected using the fluid
velocity field, do not in general follow the mass flow correctly, and explain
why this is the case. This method can result in orders-of-magnitude biases in
simulations of driven turbulence and in cosmological simulations, rendering the
velocity field tracers inappropriate for following these flows. We then discuss
a novel implementation of `Monte Carlo tracers', which are moved along with
fluid cells, and are exchanged probabilistically between them following the
mass flux. This method reproduces the mass distribution of the fluid correctly.
The main limitation of this approach is that it is more diffusive than the
fluid itself. Nonetheless, we show that this novel approach is more reliable
than what has been employed previously and demonstrate that it is appropriate
for following hydrodynamical flows in mesh-based codes. The Monte Carlo tracers
can also naturally be transferred between fluid cells and other types of

accurate treatment of radiation transport to, for example, properly determine
cooling and fragmentation properties. The radiation transport algorithm should
be as fast as the (magneto-) hydrodynamics to allow for an efficient usage of
computing resources.
  Methods: We use a setup of a central star and a slightly flared circumstellar
disk. We perform simulations for a wide range of optical depths of the disk's
midplane from tau(550nm) = 0.1 up to tau(810nm) = 1 million. We check the
accuracy of the gray flux-limited diffusion (FLD) approximation and a gray and
frequency-dependent ray-tracing plus FLD approximation.
  Results:
  1. For moderate optical depths, a gray approximation of the stellar
irradiation yields a slightly hotter inner rim and a slightly cooler midplane
of the disk at larger radii, but is otherwise in agreement with the
frequency-dependent treatment.
  2. The gray FLD approximation fails to compute an appropriate temperature
profile in all regimes of optical depth; the maximum deviations to the
comparison runs are 50 percent in the optically thin and up to 280 percent in
the optically thick limit. For low optical depth, the isotropic assumption
within the FLD method yields a too steep decrease of the radial temperature
slope. For higher optical depths, the FLD approximation does not reproduce the
shadow behind the optically thick inner rim of the circumstellar disk, yielding
artificial heating at larger disk radii.
  3. The frequency-dependent RT + gray FLD approximation yields remarkable
accuracy for the whole range of optical depths.
  Conclusions: The high accuracy of the frequency-dependent hybrid radiation
transport algorithm makes this method ideally suited for (magneto-)
hydrodynamical studies of irradiated circumstellar disks.

stable and pressure-driven, and g modes, which are are gravity driven. The g

behavior is somewhat different because a cylindrical geometry has less symmetry
than a spherical geometry. This implies that perturbations are classified by a
radial quantum number, an azimuthal quantum number, and wavelength in the z
direction, which can become arbitrarily large. We find that decreasing this
wavelength increases the frequency of stable modes and increases the growth
rate of unstable modes. We use use variational arguments to demonstrate that

(BHs), with luminosities as high as 10^48 erg/sec. It is often expected though
that such an extremely energetic process will take place in the most massive
bound structures in the dark matter (DM) distribution. We show that in contrast
to this expectation, in a galaxy formation model which includes AGN feedback,
quasars are predicted to live in average DM halo environments with typical
masses of a few times 10^12 Msun. This fundamental prediction arises from the
fact that quasar activity (i.e., BH accretion with luminosity greater than
10^46 erg/sec) is inhibited in DM haloes where AGN feedback operates. The
galaxy hosts of quasars in our simulations are identified with over massive (in
gas and stars) spheroidal galaxies, in which BH accretion is triggered via a
galaxy merger or secular processes. We further show that the z=0 descendants of
high redshift (z~6) QSOs span a wide range of morphologies, galaxy and halo
masses. The z~6 BHs typically grow only by a modest factor by the present day.
Remarkably, high redshift QSOs never inhabit the largest DM haloes at that time
and their descendants are very seldom found in the most massive haloes at z=0.
We also show that observationally it is very likely to find an enhancement in
the abundance of galaxies around quasars at z~5. However, these enhancements
are considerably weaker compared to the overdensities expected at the extreme
peaks of the DM distribution. Thus, it is very unlikely that a quasar detected
in the $z\gtrsim5$ Universe pinpoints the location of the progenitors of
superclusters in the local Universe.

haloes with masses of ~10^13 Msun. We then compare our findings to the
theoretical predictions of the coupled galaxy and black hole formation model
GALFORM. We find good agreement when our calculation includes the hot-halo mode
of accretion onto the central black hole. This type of accretion, which is
additional to the common cold accretion during disk instabilities and galaxy
mergers, is tightly coupled to the AGN feedback in the model. The hot-halo mode
becomes prominent in DM haloes with masses greater than ~10^12.5 Msun, where
AGN feedback typically operates, giving rise to a distinct class of moderate
luminosity AGN that inhabit rich clusters and superclusters. Cold gas fuelling
of the black hole cannot produce the observationally inferred DM halo masses of
X-ray AGN. Switching off AGN feedback in the model results in a large
population of luminous quasars (Lx(2-10 keV) > 10^44 erg/sec) in DM haloes with
masses up to ~10^14 Msun, which is inconsistent with the observed clustering of
quasars. The abundance of hot-halo AGN decreases significantly in the z~3-4
universe. At such high redshifts, the cold accretion mode is solely responsible
for shaping the environment of moderate luminosity AGN. Our analysis supports
two accretion modes (cold and hot) for the fuelling of supermassive black holes

Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) field. Using this
sample we determine how galaxy structure and morphology evolve with time. We
visually classify our sample into disks, ellipticals and peculiar systems and
correct for redshift effects on our classifications through simulations. We
find evolution in the fractions of galaxies at a given visual classification as
a function of redshift. The peculiar population is dominant at z>2 with a
substantial spheroid population, and a negligible disk population. We compute
the transition redshift, ztrans, where the combined fraction of spheroids and
disks is equal to that of peculiar galaxies, as ztrans=1.86+/-0.62 for galaxies
in our stellar mass range. We find that this changes as a function of stellar
mass, with Hubble-type systems becoming dominant at higher redshifts for higher
mass galaxies (ztrans=2.22+/-0.82), than for the lower mass galaxies
(ztrans=1.73+/-0.57). Higher mass galaxies become morphologically settled
before their lower mass counterparts, a form of morphological downsizing. We
furthermore compare our visual classifications with Sersic index, the
concentration, asymmetry and clumpiness (CAS) parameters, star formation rate
and rest frame U-B colour. We find links between the colour of a galaxy, its
star formation rate and how extended or peculiar it appears. Finally, we
discuss the negligible z>2 disk fraction based on visual morphologies and
speculate that this is an effect of forming disks appearing peculiar through
processes such as violent disk instabilities or mergers. We conclude that to
properly define high redshift morphology a new and more exact classification
scheme is needed.

generalizes to paths that contain steps S=(0,-1) at prescribed x-coordinates.

which time the equation of state peaks at +1. Such an adjustment in the dark

aptitude. Low aptitude physics students had a negative correlation between exam
performance and completing homework; the more homework problems they did, the
worse their performance was on exams. One explanation for this effect is that
the assigned homework problems placed an excessive cognitive load on low

have taken place when low aptitude students attempted to do assigned homework.
Another explanation is based on the fact that the negative benefit effects
first appeared when magnetism concepts were introduced. According to this
explanation, low aptitude students had difficulty consolidating knowledge of
magnetic fields with previously-learned knowledge of electric fields. A third
possibility, that a high homework copying rate by low aptitude students impeded

b is apsidally aligned with the belt and 90% of allowed orbits have mutual
inclination 36 deg or less. Fomalhaut b's orbit is belt-crossing in projection,
but only 12% of possible orbits have nodes within a 25 AU wide belt annulus
(133-158 AU). The high e invokes a dynamical history where Fom b may have
experienced a significant dynamical interaction with a hypothetical planet
Fomalhaut c, and the current orbital configuration may be relatively
short-lived. The new value for the periastron distance diminishes the Hill
radius of Fom b and any weakly bound satellite system surrounding a planet
would be sheared and dynamically heated at periapse. We argue that Fom b's
minimum mass is that of a dwarf planet in order for a circumplanetary satellite
system to remain bound to a sufficient radius from the planet to be consistent
with the dust scattered light hypothesis. Fom b may be optically bright because
the recent passage through periapse and/or the ascending node has increased the
erosion rates of planetary satellites. In the coplanar case, Fomalhaut b will
collide with the main belt around 2032, and the subsequent emergent phenomena
may help determine its physical nature.

spectra of seven LINER nuclei at different epochs with time scales of years. To
search for variability we fit all the spectra from the same object with a set
of models, in order to identify the parameters responsible for the variability
pattern. We also analyzed the light curves in order to search for short time
scale (from hours to days) variability. Whenever possible, UV variability was
also studied. We found spectral variability in four objects, with variations
mostly related to hard energies (2-10 keV). These variations are due to changes
in the soft excess, and/or changes in the absorber, and/or intrinsic variations
of the source. Another two galaxies seem not to vary. Short time scale
variations during individual observations were not found. Our analysis confirms
the previously reported anticorrelation between the X-ray spectral index and
the Eddington ratio, and also the correlation between the X-ray to UV flux
ratio and the Eddington ratio. These results support an Advection Dominated
Accretion Flow (ADAF) as the accretion mechanism in LINERs.

where nodal d-wave state is strongly preferred, there is a smooth evolution to
the quasi-1D limit, where a striking near-degeneracy is found between a p-wave-

is produced by charge-density-wave order, not only is the pairing scale
reduced, but the symmetry of the pairs switches from $d_{x^2-y^2} to $d_{xy}$;
in the context of the cuprates, this suggests that were the pseudo-gap entirely

linear logic. We find that the appropriate notion of model is a special kind of
promonoidal category. Since the theory of promonoidal categories has not been
developed very thoroughly, at least in the published literature, we need to
develop it here. The most natural way to do this - and the simplest, once the
(substantial) groundwork has been laid - is to consider promonoidal categories
as an instance of the general theory of pseudomonoids in a monoidal bicategory.
Accordingly, we describe and explain the notions of monoidal bicategory and
pseudomonoid therein.
  The higher-dimensional nature of monoidal bicategories presents serious
notational difficulties, since to use the natural analogue of the commutative
diagrams used in ordinary category theory would require the use of
three-dimensional diagrams. We therefore introduce a novel technical device,
which we dub the calculus of components, that simplifies the business of
reasoning about a certain class of algebraic structure internal to a monoidal
bicategory. When viewed through this simplifying lens, the theory of
pseudomonoids turns out to be essentially formally identical to the ordinary
theory of monoidal categories. We indicate how the calculus of components may
be extended to cover structures that make use of the braiding in a braided
monoidal bicategory, and use this to study braided pseudomonoids.
  A higher-dimensional analogue of Cayley's theorem is proved, and used to
deduce a novel characterisation of the unit of a promonoidal category. This,
and the other preceding work, is then used to give two characterisations of the
categories that model the unitless fragment of intuitionistic multiplicative
linear logic. Finally we consider the non-intuitionistic case, where the second
characterisation in particular takes a surprisingly simple form.

exactly correct MCMC methods for sampling $\pi$, even though their transitions
are constructed using an approximation. These methods are equivalent when their
tuning parameters are set at the simplest values, but differ in general. We
compare how well these methods work when using several approximations, finding
on synthetic datasets that a $\pi^*$ based on the ""Subset of Data"" (SOD) method

reliability compared to direct measurements of elongation, particularly at
lower temperatures, thus avoiding significant experimental error. An excellent
Arrhenius fit is obtained from which an activation energy for viscous flow of
Ea = 450 kJ/mol is extracted; addition of an additional temperature dependent
pre-exponential does not change this value. This value is less than that
idealised by some literature but consistent with other literature. The log plot
of viscosity is overall found to be consistent with that reported in the
literature for silica measurements on rod and beams, but substantially higher
to past work reported for optical fibres. The discrepancy from an idealised
activation energy Ea ~ 700 kJ/mol may be explained by noting the higher fictive
temperature of the fibre. On the other hand, past optical fibre results
obtained by beam bending with much lower values leave questions regarding the
method of viscosity measurement and the time taken for structural
equilibration. We note that because regenerated gratings already involve
post-annealing to stabilise their operation at higher temperature, the
structures are much more relaxed compared to normal fibres. This work
highlights the need to stabilize components for operation in harsh environments
before their application, despite some mechanical compromise. Given the
increasing expectation of all-optical waveguide technologies operating above

from ground state transitions to over 1200 K in upper-state energy.
Low-excitation lines are detected in multiple components, but the
highest-excitation lines ($E_u >$ 500 K) are well modeled as emitting from a
small ($\sim 2""$) clump with a high abundance of H$_2$O ($\chi = 6.5 \times
10^{-4}$ relative to H$_2$) and a HDO/H$_2$O ratio of 0.003. Using high spatial

located near, but not directly coincident with, known continuum sources in the
Hot Core region. Significant HDO/H$_2$O fractionation is also seen in the
Compact Ridge and Plateau components. The outflowing gas, observed with both
emission and absorption components, has a lower HDO/H$_2$O ratio than the

linear superposition, tensor product and qubits form the fundamental basis of
quantum computing, the proposed method presents the machine level
representation of images on quantum computers. Unlike other methods, this

optimization problem. Several meta-optimization methods have been proposed to
find the best parameter set for a given optimization algorithm and (set of)
problem instances. When the objective of the optimization is some scalar
quality of the solution given by the target algorithm, this quality is also
used as the basis for the quality of parameter sets. But in the case of
multi-objective optimization by aggregation, the set of solutions is given by
several single-objective runs with different weights on the objectives, and it
turns out that the hypervolume of the final population of each single-objective
run might be a better indicator of the global performance of the aggregation
method than the best fitness in its population. This paper discusses this issue
on a case study in multi-objective temporal planning using the evolutionary
planner DaE-YAHSP and the meta-optimizer ParamILS. The results clearly show how
ParamILS makes a difference between both approaches, and demonstrate that
indeed, in this context, using the hypervolume indicator as ParamILS target is
the best choice. Other issues pertaining to parameter tuning in the proposed

than the most recent study of the mu0 distribution. We demonstrate that there
is a bimodality in the distribution of mu0. Between the low and high surface
brightness galaxy regimes there is a lack of intermediate surface brightness
galaxies.
  Caveats invoked in the literature from small number statistics to the
knowledge of the environmental influences, and possible biases from low signal
to noise data or corrections for galaxy inclination are investigated. Analyses
show that the bimodal distribution of mu0 cannot be due to any of these biases
or statistical fluctuations. It is highly probable that galaxies settle in two
stable modes: a dark matter dominated mode where the dark matter dominates at
all radii - this gives birth to low surface brightness galaxies - and a
baryonic matter dominated mode where the baryons dominate the dark matter in
the central parts - this gives rise to the high surface brightness disks. The
lack of intermediate surface brightness objects suggests that galaxies avoid
(staying in) a mode where dark matter and baryons are co-dominant in the

However, it is also believed that these simple tree models are not capable of
capturing large variations in many scenarios, such as human pose estimation.
This paper attempts to address three questions: 1) are simple tree models
sufficient? more specifically, 2) how to use tree models effectively in human
pose estimation? and 3) how shall we use combined parts together with single
parts efficiently?
  Assuming we have a set of single parts and combined parts, and the goal is to
estimate a joint distribution of their locations. We surprisingly find that no
latent variables are introduced in the Leeds Sport Dataset (LSP) during
learning latent trees for deformable model, which aims at approximating the
joint distributions of body part locations using minimal tree structure. This
suggests one can straightforwardly use a mixed representation of single and
combined parts to approximate their joint distribution in a simple tree model.
As such, one only needs to build Visual Categories of the combined parts, and
then perform inference on the learned latent tree. Our method outperformed the
state of the art on the LSP, both in the scenarios when the training images are
from the same dataset and from the PARSE dataset. Experiments on animal images
from the VOC challenge further support our findings.

steeper than the Salpeter function at sigma0>220km/s. We analyze a variety of
spectral indices, corrected to solar scale by means of semi-empirical

population models. Our analysis suggests that sigma0, rather than [alpha/Fe],
drives the IMF variation. Although our analysis cannot discriminate between a
single power-law (unimodal) and a low-mass (<0.5MSun) tapered (bimodal) IMF, we
can robustly constrain the fraction in low-mass stars at birth, that is found
to increase from 20% at sigma0~100km/s, up to 80% at sigma0~300km/s. Additional
constraints can be provided with stellar mass-to-light (M/L) ratios: unimodal
models predict M/L significantly larger than dynamical M/L, across the whole
sigma0 range, whereas a bimodal IMF is compatible. Our results are robust
against individual abundance variations. No significant variation is found in
Na and Ca in addition to the expected change from the correlation between

separate spheres differing by a slight amount in their refractive index. This
is caused by an oscillatory behavior in the force with respect to the
nondimensional wave number $\alpha$ in the surrounding medium. Fine-tuning the
wave number $\alpha$, relative to the given refractive indices in the system,
may lead to particle expulsion. The sorting mechanism turns out to be feasible
when $\alpha$ is about 18-20 or larger, which actually is in the region of

high-genus ($g\geq 1$) surfaces. Surface registration between simple surfaces,
such as simply-connected open surfaces, has been well studied. However, very
few works have been carried out for the registration of high-genus surfaces.
The high-genus topology of the surface poses great challenge for surface
registration. A possible approach is to partition surfaces into
simply-connected patches and registration is done patch by patch. Consistent
cuts are required, which are usually difficult to obtain and prone to error. In
this work, we propose an effective way to obtain geometric registration between
high-genus surfaces without introducing consistent cuts. The key idea is to
conformally parameterize the surface into its universal covering space, which
is either the Euclidean plane or the hyperbolic disk embedded in
$\mathbb{R}^2$. Registration can then be done on the universal covering space
by minimizing a shape mismatching energy measuring the geometric dissimilarity
between the two surfaces. Our proposed algorithm effectively computes a smooth
registration between high-genus surfaces that matches geometric information as
much as possible. The algorithm can also be applied to find a smooth and
bijective registration minimizing any general energy functionals. Numerical
experiments on high-genus surface data show that our proposed method is
effective for registering high-genus surfaces with geometric matching. We also
applied the method to register anatomical structures for medical imaging, which
demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed algorithm.

theory, showing that the Kohn-Sham equations can be derived as a macroscopic

To derive the approach, we first write the Schr\""odinger equation as a special
case of a Boltzmann equation for a gas of quasi-particles, with the potential
playing the role of an external source that generates and destroys particles,
so as to drive the system towards the ground state. The ions are treated as
classical particles, using the Born-Oppenheimer dynamics, or by imposing
concurrent evolution with the electronic orbitals. In order to provide
quantitative support to our approach, we implement a discrete (lattice) model

geometrical configuration of the methane molecule. Excellent agreement with

observations to estimate the plasma parameters of the outer solar corona (> 0.2

radio burst at the frequency range of 8-32 MHz during the time interval of
09:50-12:30 UT in April 14, 2011. The burst was connected to C2.3 flare, which
occurred in AR 11190 during 09:38-09:49 UT. The dynamic spectrum of radio
emission shows clear quasi-periodic variations in the emission intensity at
almost all frequencies. Wavelet analysis at four different frequencies (29 MHz,
25 MHz, 22 MHz and 14 MHz) shows the quasi-periodic variation of emission
intensity with periods of 34 min and 23 min. The periodic variations can be
explained by the first and second harmonics of vertical kink oscillation of
transequatorial coronal loops, which were excited by the same flare. The apex
of transequatorial loops may reach up to 1.2 R_0 altitude. We derive and solve
the dispersion relation of trapped MHD oscillations in a longitudinally
inhomogeneous magnetic slab. The analysis shows that a thin (with width to
length ratio of 0.1), dense (with the ratio of internal and external densities
of > 20) magnetic slab with weak longitudinal inhomogeneity may trap the
observed oscillations. Seismologically estimated Alfv\'en speed inside the loop
at the height of 1 R_0 is 1000 km/s. Then the magnetic field strength at this

these spectral line data with our previous SABOCA 350-{\mu}m dust continuum map
of the source. The subfragments are characterised by subsonic internal
non-thermal motions ({\sigma}NT~0.5cs), and most of them appear to be
gravitationally bound. The dispersion of the N2H+ velocity centroids among the
condensations is very low (0.02 km/s). The CO depletion factors we derive,
fD=0.8+/-0.4 - 3.6+/-1.5, do not suggest any significant CO freeze-out but this
may be due to the canonical CO abundance we adopt. The fractional abundances of
N2H+ and N2D+ with respect to H2 are found to be ~0.9-2.3x10^-9 and
~4.9-9.9x10^-10, respectively. The deuterium fractionation of N2H+, or the
N2D+/N2H+ column density ratio, lies in the range 0.30+/-0.07 - 0.43+/-0.09.
The detected substructure inside SMM 6 is likely the result of cylindrical
Jeans-type gravitational fragmentation. We estimate the timescale for this
fragmentation to be ~1.8x10^5 yr. The condensations are unlikely to be able to
interact with one another and coalesce before local gravitational collapse
ensues. Moreover, significant mass growth of the condensations via
competitive-like accretion from the parent core seems unfeasible. The high
level of molecular deuteration in the condensations suggests that gas-phase CO
should be strongly depleted. It also points towards an advanced stage of
chemical evolution. The subfragments of SMM 6 might therefore be near the onset
of gravitational collapse, but whether they can form protostellar or substellar
objects (brown dwarfs) depends on the local star formation efficiency and
remains to be clarified.

Banach algebra dynamical system $(A,G,\alpha)$ and a class $\mathcal{R}$ of
continuous covariant representations, and its representations were determined.
In this paper the theory is developed further. We consider the dependence of
the crossed product on the class $\mathcal{R}$ and its essential uniqueness.
Next we study generalized Beurling algebras: weighted Bochner spaces of
$A$-valued functions on $G$ with a continuous multiplication. Though not Banach
algebras in general, they are isomorphic to a crossed product of a Banach
algebra, and the earlier work therefore predicts the structure of their
representations. Classical results for the usual Beurling (Banach) algebras of
scalar valued functions are then retrieved as special cases. We also show how,
e.g., an anti-covariant pair of anti-representations of $A$ and $G$ can be
viewed as a covariant pair for a related Banach algebra dynamical system, so
that the earlier work becomes applicable to classes of such other pairs. After
including material on the representations of the projective tensor product of
Banach algebras, we combine this idea with the results already obtained and
describe the two-sided modules over the generalized Beurling algebras, where
again specializing to the scalars gives a classical result.

alpha-enhanced galaxies to study the effect of abundance changes on molecular
chemistry. We selected a sample of metal rich spiral and star bursting objects
from the literature, and present here new data for a sample of early-type
galaxies (ETGs). We conducted the first survey of CS and methanol emission in
ETGs, detecting 7 objects in CS, and 5 in methanol emission. We find evidence
to support the hypothesis that CS is a better tracer of dense star-forming gas
than HCN. We suggest that the methanol emission in these sources is driven by
dust mantle destruction due to ionisation from high mass star formation, but
cannot rule out shocks dominating in some sources. The derived source averaged
CS/methanol column densities and rotation temperatures are similar to those
found in normal spiral and starburst galaxies, suggesting dense clouds are
little affected by the differences between galaxy types. Finally we used the
total column density ratios for our galaxy samples to show for the first time
that some molecular tracers do seem to show systematic variations that appear
to correlate with metallicity, and that these variations roughly match those
predicted by chemical models. Using this fact, the chemical models of Bayet et
al. (2012b), and assumptions about the optical depth we are able to roughly
predict the metallicity of our spiral and ETG sample, with a scatter of ~0.3
dex. We provide the community with linear approximations to the relationship
between the HCN and CS column density ratio and metallicity. Further study will
clearly be required to determine if this, or any, molecular tracer can be used
to robustly determine gas-phase metallically, but that a relationship exists at
all suggests that in the future it may be possible to calibrate a metallicity
indicator for the molecular interstellar medium (abridged).

microscopic recordings of neural membrane potentials and membrane currents, but
also in macroscopic EEG (electroencephalographic) recordings. While complex

here demonstrate a possible origin of such power laws in the biophysical

advantage of the analytical tractability of the so called ball and stick neuron

of measures of neuronal activity: the soma membrane current, the current-dipole
moment (corresponding to the single-neuron EEG contribution), and the soma

respective measurements to the PSDs of the noisy input currents. With
homogeneously distributed input currents across the neuronal membrane we find
that all PSD transfer functions express asymptotic high-frequency 1/f^alpha

as alpha_inf^I = 1/2 for the soma membrane current, alpha_inf^p = 3/2 for the
current-dipole moment, and alpha_inf^V = 2 for the soma membrane potential.
These power-law exponents are found for arbitrary combinations of uncorrelated

showed larger contributions to both the Poynting flux and the energy
dissipation rates. The higher frequency waves were identified as combinations
of ion-acoustic waves, electron cyclotron drift instability driven waves,
electrostatic solitary waves, and whistler mode waves. These waves were found
to have: (1) amplitudes capable of exceeding dB ~ 10 nT and dE ~ 300 mV/m,

were found to be in excess of four orders of magnitude greater than was
necessary to explain the increase in entropy across the shocks. Thus, the waves
need only be, at times, < 0.01% efficient to balance the nonlinear wave
steepening that produces the shocks. Therefore, these results show for the

neutron stars influences spin up to millisecond periods via accretion. Our
arguments are based on nearly-resonant interactions of the R mode with pairs of
""daughter modes"". The amplitude of the R mode saturates at the lowest value for
which parametric instability leads to significant excitation of a particular
pair of daughters. The lower bound on this limiting amplitude is proportional
to the damping rate of the daughter modes that are excited parametrically.
Based on this picture, we show that if modes damp because of dissipation in a
very thin boundary layer at the crust-core boundary then spin up to frequencies
larger than about 300 Hz does not occur. Within this conventional scenario the
R mode saturates at an amplitude that is too large for angular momentum gain
from accretion to overcome gravitational loss to gravitational radiation. We
conclude that lower dissipation is required for spin up to frequencies much
higher than 300 Hz. We conjecture that if the transition from the fluid core to
the crystalline crust occurs over a distance much longer than 1 cm then a sharp
viscous boundary layer fails to form. In this case, damping is due to shear
viscosity dissipation integrated over the entire star; the rate is slower than
if a viscous boundary layer forms. We use statistical arguments and scaling
relations to estimate the lowest parametric instability threshold from first
principles. The resulting saturation amplitudes are low enough to permit spin
up to higher frequencies. Further, we show that the requirement that the lowest
parametric instability amplitude be small enough to allow continued spin up
imposes an upper bound to the frequencies that may be attained via accretion
that may plausibly be about 750 Hz. Within this framework, the R mode is
unstable for all millisecond pulsars, whether accreting or not.

(LQC) with a small cosmological constant that models a universe moving along an
ellipse, which prevents singularities like the big bang or the big rip, in the
phase space $(H,\rho)$, where $H$ is the Hubble parameter and $\rho$ the energy
density of the universe. Using LQC when one considers a model of universe
filled by radiation and matter where, due to the cosmological constant, there
are a de Sitter and an anti de Sitter solution. This means that one obtains a
bouncing non-singular universe which is in the contracting phase at early
times. After leaving this phase, i.e., after bouncing, it passes trough a
radiation and matter dominated phase and finally at late times it expands in an
accelerated way (current cosmic acceleration). This model does not suffer from
the horizon and flatness problems as in big bang cosmology, where a period of
inflation that increases the size of our universe in more than 60 e-folds is
needed in order to solve both problems. The model has two mechanisms to avoid
these problems: The evolution of the universe through a contracting phase and a

is threshold partial pivoting. When selecting a pivot, the entire candidate
pivot column below the diagonal must be up-to-date and must be scanned. If the
factorization is parallelized across a large number of cores, communication
latencies can be the dominant computational cost.
  In this paper, we propose two alternative pivoting strategies for sparse
symmetric indefinite matrices that significantly reduce communication by
compressing the necessary data into a small matrix that can be used to select
pivots. Once pivots have been chosen, they can be applied in a
communication-efficient fashion.
  For an n x p submatrix on P processors, we show our methods perform a
factorization using O(log P) messages instead of the O(p log P) for threshold
partial pivoting. The additional costs in terms of operations and communication
bandwidth are relatively small.
  A stability proof is given and numerical results using a range of symmetric
indefinite matrices arising from practical problems are used to demonstrate the
practical robustness. Timing results on large random examples illustrate the
potential speedup on current multicore machines.

supernova (SN Ia) SN2011fe, taken on 10 epochs from -13.1 to +40.8 days
relative to B-band maximum light, and spanning the far-ultraviolet (UV) to the
near-infrared (IR) are presented. This spectroscopic coverage makes SN2011fe
the best-studied local SN Ia to date. SN2011fe is a typical moderately-luminous
SN Ia with no evidence for dust extinction. Its near-UV spectral properties are
representative of a larger sample of local events (Maguire et al. 2012). The
near-UV to optical spectra of SN2011fe are modelled with a Monte Carlo
radiative transfer code using the technique of 'abundance tomography',
constraining the density structure and the abundance stratification in the SN
ejecta. SN2011fe was a relatively weak explosion, with moderate Fe-group
yields. The density structures of the classical model W7 and of a delayed
detonation model were tested. Both have shortcomings. An ad-hoc density
distribution was developed which yields improved fits and is characterised by a
high-velocity tail, which is absent in W7. However, this tail contains less
mass than delayed detonation models. This improved model has a lower energy
than one-dimensional explosion models matching typical SNe Ia (e.g. W7, WDD1).
The derived Fe abundance in the outermost layer is consistent with the
metallicity at the SN explosion site in M101 (~0.5 Zsolar). The spectroscopic
rise time (~19 days) is significantly longer than that measured from the early
optical light curve, implying a 'dark phase' of ~1 day. A longer rise time has
significant implications when deducing the properties of the white dwarf and
binary system from the early photometric behaviour.

of contacts between individuals, and compare the effect of several immunization
strategies on these processes. An immunization strategy is defined as the
choice of a set of nodes (individuals) who cannot catch nor transmit the
disease. This choice is performed according to a certain ranking of the nodes
of the contact network. We consider various ranking strategies, focusing in
particular on the role of the training window during which the nodes'
properties are measured in the time-varying network: longer training windows
correspond to a larger amount of information collected and could be expected to
result in better performances of the immunization strategies. We find instead
an unexpected saturation in the efficiency of strategies based on nodes'
characteristics when the length of the training window is increased, showing
that a limited amount of information on the contact patterns is sufficient to
design efficient immunization strategies. This finding is balanced by the large
variations of the contact patterns, which strongly alter the importance of
nodes from one period to the next and therefore significantly limit the
efficiency of any strategy based on an importance ranking of nodes. We also
observe that the efficiency of strategies that include an element of randomness
and are based on temporally local information do not perform as well but are
largely independent on the amount of information available.

directional Dark Matter as the track sampling along the drift field will be
improved while keeping almost the same Fluorine content of the gas mixture. We

only a blurry observation. Because this problem is fundamentally ill-posed,
strong priors on both the sharp image and blur kernel are required to
regularize the solution space. While this naturally leads to a standard MAP
estimation framework, performance is compromised by unknown trade-off parameter
settings, optimization heuristics, and convergence issues stemming from
non-convexity and/or poor prior selections. To mitigate some of these problems,
a number of authors have recently proposed substituting a variational Bayesian
(VB) strategy that marginalizes over the high-dimensional image space leading
to better estimates of the blur kernel. However, the underlying cost function
now involves both integrals with no closed-form solution and complex,
function-valued arguments, thus losing the transparency of MAP. Beyond standard
Bayesian-inspired intuitions, it thus remains unclear by exactly what mechanism
these methods are able to operate, rendering understanding, improvements and
extensions more difficult. To elucidate these issues, we demonstrate that the
VB methodology can be recast as an unconventional MAP problem with a very
particular penalty/prior that couples the image, blur kernel, and noise level
in a principled way. This unique penalty has a number of useful characteristics
pertaining to relative concavity, local minima avoidance, and scale-invariance
that allow us to rigorously explain the success of VB including its existing
implementational heuristics and approximations. It also provides strict
criteria for choosing the optimal image prior that, perhaps
counter-intuitively, need not reflect the statistics of natural scenes. In so
doing we challenge the prevailing notion of why VB is successful for blind
deconvolution while providing a transparent platform for introducing
enhancements.

previously. Most importantly, a second knee in the cosmic ray spectrum --
dominated by heavy primaries -- is reported just below 10^{17} eV. The light
component, on the other hand, exhibits an ankle like feature above 10^{17} eV
and starts to dominate the flux at the ankle. The key question at the highest
energies is about the origin of the flux suppression observed at energies above
5 x 10^{19} eV. Is this the long awaited GZK-effect or the exhaustion of
sources? The key to answering this question is again given by the still largely

that question. The high level of isotropy observed even at the highest energies

of their isomers in our sensitive unbiased line survey at 3, 2, and 1mm. We
derived column densities and abundances through Bayesian analysis using a large

of CH3NC at millimeter wavelength. We detected 17 lines of CH3CN at the PDR and
6 at the dense core position, and we resolved its hyperfine structure for 3
lines. We detected 4 lines of HC3N, and C3N is clearly detected at the PDR

we found that including electron excitation reduces the derived column density
by 40% at the PDR position. While CH3CN is 30 times more abundant in the PDR
than in the dense core, HC3N has similar abundance at both positions. The
isomeric ratio CH3NC/CH3CN is 0.15+-0.02. In the case of CH3CN, pure gas phase

one-dimensional profiles, for which there is a scarcity of methodologies able
to classify the pertinence of a given result to a specific group. The
polarization curves that evaluate the corrosion kinetics of electrodes in
corrosive media are an application where the behavior is chiefly analyzed from
profiles. Polarization curves are indeed a classic method to determine the
global kinetics of metallic electrodes, but the strong nonlinearity from
different metals and alloys can overlap and the discrimination becomes a
challenging problem. Moreover, even finding a typical curve from replicated
tests requires subjective judgement. In this paper we used the so-called
multi-q approach based on the Tsallis statistics in a classification engine to
separate multiple polarization curve profiles of two stainless steels. We
collected 48 experimental polarization curves in aqueous chloride medium of two
stainless steel types, with different resistance against localized corrosion.
Multi-q pattern analysis was then carried out on a wide potential range, from
cathodic up to anodic regions. An excellent classification rate was obtained,
at a success rate of 90%, 80%, and 83% for low (cathodic), high (anodic), and
both potential ranges, respectively, using only 2% of the original profile
data. These results show the potential of the proposed approach towards
efficient, robust, systematic and automatic classification of highly non-linear
profile curves.

model is given, from the viewpoints of topologic, algebraic and geometric
aspects. By analyzing the relations among transfer matrices of the 3D Ising
model, Reidemeister moves in the knot theory, Yang-Baxter and tetrahedron
equations, the following facts are illustrated for the 3D Ising model: 1) The
complexified quaternion basis constructed for the 3D Ising model represents
naturally the rotation in a (3 + 1) - dimensional space-time, as a relativistic
quantum statistical mechanics model, which is consistent with the 4-fold
integrand of the partition function by taking the time average. 2) A unitary
transformation with a matrix being a spin representation in 2^(nlo)-space
corresponds to a rotation in 2nlo-space, which serves to smooth all the
crossings in the transfer matrices and contributes as the non-trivial topologic
part of the partition function of the 3D Ising model. 3) A tetrahedron relation
would ensure the commutativity of the transfer matrices and the integrability
of the 3D Ising model, and its existence is guaranteed also by the Jordan
algebra and the Jordan-von Neumann-Wigner procedures. 4) The unitary
transformation for smoothing the crossings in the transfer matrices changes the
wave functions by complex phases {\Phi}x, {\Phi}y, and {\Phi}z. The relation
with quantum field and gauge theories, physical significance of weight factors
are discussed in details. The conjectured exact solution is compared with
numerical results, and singularities at/near infinite temperature are
inspected. The analyticity in {\beta} = 1/(kB T) of both the hard-core and
Ising models has been proved for {\beta} > 0, not for {\beta} = 0. Thus the
high-temperature series cannot serve as a standard for judging a putative exact
solution of the 3D Ising model.

iron-arsenide superconductor Sr2VO3FeAs. Rietveld refinements of neutron powder
patterns confirm the ideal composition without oxygen deficiencies. Experiments
with polarized neutrons prove weak magnetic ordering in the V-sublattice of
Sr2VO3FeAs at ~ 45 K with a probable propagation vector q = (1/8,1/8,0). The
ordered moment of ~ 0.1 muB is too small to remove the V-3d bands from the
Fermi level by magnetic exchange splitting, and much smaller than predicted
from a recent LDA+U study. By using DFT calculations with a GGA+EECE functional
we recover the typical quasi-nested Fermi-surface even without magnetic moment.
From this we suggest that the V-atoms are in a Mott-state where the electronic
correlations are dominated by on-site Coulomb-repulsion which shifts the V-3d
states away from the Fermi energy. Our results are consistent with
photoemission data and clearly reveal that Sr2VO3FeAs is a typical
iron-arsenide superconductor with quasi-nested hole- and electron-like Fermi
surface sheets, and constitutes no new paradigm. We suggest that intrinsic
electron-doping through V3+/V4+ mixed valence is responsible for the absence of
SDW ordering.

compact objects (CCOs) in supernova remnants, three of which have similar
timing and magnetic properties as the DRPs, but are bright, thermal X-ray
sources consistent with minimal neutron star cooling curves. Since none of the

stars whose supernova remnants has dissipated. Upper limits on their thermal
X-ray luminosities are in the range log Lx[erg/s] = 31.8-32.8, which implies
cooling ages > 1E4 - 1E5 yr, roughly 10 times the ages of the approximately 10

central challenge to advance the understanding of brain function. Because of
the inability of any single neuroimaging techniques to cover all aspects at
once, there is a growing interest to combine signals from multiple modalities
in order to benefit from the advantages of each acquisition method. Due to the
complexity and unknown parameterization of any suggested complete model of BOLD
response in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the development of a
reliable ultimate fusion approach remains difficult. But besides the primary
goal of superior temporal and spatial resolution, conjoint analysis of data
from multiple imaging modalities can alternatively be used to segregate neural
information from physiological and acquisition noise. In this paper we suggest
a novel methodology which relies on constructing a quantifiable mapping of data
from one modality (electroencephalography; EEG) into another (fMRI), called
transmodal analysis of neural signals (TRANSfusion). TRANSfusion attempts to
map neural data embedded within the EEG signal into its reflection in fMRI
data. Assessing the mapping performance on unseen data allows to localize brain
areas where a significant portion of the signal could be reliably
reconstructed, hence the areas neural activity of which is reflected in both
EEG and fMRI data. Consecutive analysis of the learnt model allows to localize
areas associated with specific frequency bands of EEG, or areas functionally
related (connected or coherent) to any given EEG sensor. We demonstrate the
performance of TRANSfusion on artificial and real data from an auditory
experiment. We further speculate on possible alternative uses: cross-modal data
filtering and EEG-driven interpolation of fMRI signals to obtain arbitrarily
high temporal sampling of BOLD.

parallel to the magnetic field. We show that, in the presence of scattering in
interplanetary space, protons at the high end of the SEP energy range
experience significant gradient and curvature drift. In the scatter-free case,
drift due to magnetic field curvature is present. The magnitude of drift
velocity increases by more than an order of magnitude at high heliographic
latitudes compared to near the ecliptic; it has a strong dependence on radial
distance r from the Sun, reaching a maximum at r~1 AU at low heliolatitudes and
r~10 AU at high heliolatitudes. Due to the mass over charge dependence of drift
velocities, the effect of drift for partially ionised SEP heavy ions is
stronger than for protons. Drift is therefore likely to be a considerable
source of cross field transport for high energy SEPs.

non-degenerate quadratic forms on a fixed real vector bundle over a connected
locally connected paracompact Hausdorff space. By interpreting the classical
inertia as a complete discrete invariant for the natural action of the general
linear group on quadratic forms, the simplest generalisation consists in
substituting such group with the group of gauge transformations of the bundle.
Contrary to the classical law of inertia, here the full action and its
restriction to the identity path component typically have different orbits,
leading to two invariants: a complete invariant for the full action is given by
the isomorphism class of the orthonormal frame bundle associated to a quadratic
form, while a complete invariant for the restricted action is the homotopy
class of any maximal positive-definite subbundle associated to a quadratic
form. The latter invariant is finer than the former, which in turn is finer
than inertia. Moreover, the orbit structure thus obtained might be used to shed
light on the topology of the space of non-degenerate quadratic forms on a
vector bundle.

most interesting for political explanations and an eclectic theory is also
considered possible. Nonpolitical explanations are diverse in character,
therefore a range of different theories (including rational choice theory and
prospect theory), depending on the kind of explanation is considered more

course of action, has the potential to explain the large cost overruns in large
scale transportation infrastructure projects. Lock-in can occur both at the
decision-making level (before the decision to build) and at the project level
(after the decision to build) and can influence the extent of overruns in two
ways. The first involves the methodology of calculating cost overruns according
to the formal decision to build. Due to lock-in, however, the real decision to
build is made much earlier in the decision-making process and the costs
estimated at that stage are often much lower than those that are estimated at a
later stage in the decision-making process, thus increasing cost overruns. The
second way that lock-in can affect cost overruns is through practice. Although
decisions about the project (design and implementation) need to be made,
lock-in can lead to inefficient decisions that involve higher costs. Sunk costs
(in terms of both time and money), the need for justification, escalating
commitment, and inflexibility and the closure of alternatives are indicators of
lock-in. In this paper, two case studies, of the Betuweroute and the HSL-South
projects in the Netherlands, demonstrate the presence of lock-in and its
influence on the extent of cost overruns at both the decision-making and
project levels. This suggests that recognition of lock-in as an explanation for
cost overruns significantly contributes to the understanding of the inadequate
planning process of projects and allows development of more appropriate means.

but because cost overruns are larger than cost underruns projects on average
have a cost overrun of 16.5%. The focus on one country further enabled to
consider cost overruns during different project development phases. It turned
out that in the Netherlands the majority of the cost overrun occurs in the
pre-construction phase (the period between the formal decision to build and the
start of construction). The frequency as well as the magnitude of
pre-construction cost overrun is significantly higher than in the construction
phase. The used methodology of calculating cost overruns does however not take
lock-in into account. This phenomenon shows that the real decision to build was
taken much earlier in the decision-making process. Since estimated costs are
usually lower during these earlier stages, the cost overruns based on this real
decision to build are likely to be much higher. Cost overruns presented in
studies are therefore often underestimated and the problem of cost overruns is
much larger than we think.

relation with cost overrun in order to decide whether this is different for
Dutch infrastructure projects compared to worldwide findings. The three
independent variables are project type (road, rail, and fixed link projects),
project size (measured in terms of estimated costs) and the length of the
project implementation phase. For Dutch projects, average cost overrun is 10.6%
for rail, 18.6% for roads and 21.7% for fixed links. For project size, small
Dutch projects have the largest average percentage cost overruns but in terms
of total overrun, large projects have a larger share. The length of the
implementation phase and especially the length of the pre-construction phase
are important determinants of cost overruns in the Netherlands. With each
additional year of pre-construction, percentage cost overrun increases by five
percentage points. In contrast, the length of the construction phase has hardly
any influence on cost overruns. This is an important contribution to current
knowledge about cost overruns, because the period in which projects are most
prone to cost overruns is narrowed down considerably, at least in the
Netherlands. This means that period can be focused on to determine the causes
and cures of overruns.

considers the observational magnitude limit, the density profile of stars as a
function of radius from the center of the cluster, and the density of stars in
multi-dimensional magnitude space. We present results of [Fe/H] for nine
well-studied open clusters based on 15 distinct UBV data sets. The [Fe/H]

solved (1) in time $2^{O(|V(H)|)}\cdot n^{O(\tw(H))}$ using the color-coding
technique of Alon, Yuster, and Zwick; (2) in time $f(|V(H)|,\tw(G))\cdot n$

$f(\maxdeg(H))\cdot n^{O(\tw(G)})$ for connected $H$ using the algorithm of
Matou\v{s}ek and Thomas. Already this small sample of results shows that the
way an algorithm can depend on the parameters is highly nontrivial and subtle.
  We develop a framework involving 10 relevant parameters for each of $H$ and
$G$ (such as treewidth, pathwidth, genus, maximum degree, number of vertices,
number of components, etc.), and ask if an algorithm with running time \[
f_1(p_1,p_2,..., p_\ell)\cdot n^{f_2(p_{\ell+1},..., p_k)} \] exist, where each
of $p_1,..., p_k$ is one of the 10 parameters depending only on $H$ or $G$. We
show that {\em all} the questions arising in this framework are answered by a
set of 11 maximal positive results (algorithms) and a set of 17 maximal
negative results (hardness proofs); some of these results already appear in the
literature, while others are new in this paper.
  On the algorithmic side, our study reveals for example that an unexpected
combination of bounded degree, genus, and feedback vertex set number of $G$
gives rise to a highly nontrivial algorithm for Subgraph Isomorphism. On the

algebraically closed and can be of any characteristic. Formation of fibred
product of commutative associative algebras is an algebraic counterpart of
gluing algebraic schemes by means of some equivalence relation in algebraic
geometry. If initial algebras are finite-dimensional vector spaces the
dimension of their product obeys Grassmann-like formula. Finite-dimensional
case means geometrically the strict version of adding two collections of points
containing some common part.
  The method involves description of algebras by generators and relations on
input and returns similar description of the product algebra. It is
""ready-to-eat"" even for computer realization. The product algebra is
well-defined: taking another descriptions of the same algebras leads to
isomorphic product algebra. Also it is proven that the product algebra enjoys

triple of algebras and a pair of homomorphisms $A_1\stackrel{f_1}{\to}A_0

another direction, historical research perceives that the performance of
heuristic search algorithms, such as A* and IDA*, can be improved by requiring
the heuristics to be consistent -- a property satisfied by any perfect
heuristic. However, a few recent studies show that inconsistent heuristics can
also be used to achieve a large improvement in these heuristic search
algorithms. These results leave us a natural question: which property of
heuristics, accuracy or consistency/inconsistency, should we focus on when
building heuristics? While there are studies on the heuristic accuracy with the
assumption of consistency, no studies on both the inconsistency and the
accuracy of heuristics are known to our knowledge.
  In this study, we investigate the relationship between the inconsistency and
the accuracy of heuristics with A* search. Our analytical result reveals a

explains the existence of three fermion families and the value of the fine
structure constant. The main idea is that the ultraviolet divergences that we
encounter in the quantum field theories of the standard model, when interpreted
appropriately, have a deep physical significance that leads to new
relationships between the physical and bare masses quarks and leptons. This
interpretation is based on the assumption of a quantum gravity induced
ultraviolet cutoff at the Planck scale and a novel approach to mass
renormalization in which the usual perturbation series for the self-mass of a
quark or lepton is rearranged and formally summed. Perturbing around the
formally summed expression leads to self-consistency equations for the physical
quark and lepton masses with multiple solutions that lie outside the reach of
conventional perturbation theory. When applied to the standard model at the
lowest level of approximation, this approach explains how three generations of
charged leptons with a mass spectrum and a value of the fine structure constant
in rough agreement with experiment can emerge from a universal bare mass and
bare electromagnetic charge. This approach also explains how three generations
of physical quark doublets (six flavors) can emerge from a universal bare
doublet and bare color charge. Finally, it explains the origin of mixing (and
CP violation) and the absence of flavor-changing neutral currents.

perform such analysis. However, their estimations require an important number

To handle this problem, a Gaussian process regression model is built to
surrogate the computer code and the Sobol indices are estimated through it. The
aim of this paper is to provide a methodology to estimate the Sobol indices
through a surrogate model taking into account both the estimation errors and
the surrogate model errors. In particular, it allows us to derive
non-asymptotic confidence intervals for the Sobol index estimations.
Furthermore, we extend the suggested strategy to the case of multi-fidelity

properties of algorithms that operate in this model. The class of GCC protocols
includes the most important discrete cake cutting protocols, and turns out to
be compatible with the study of fair division among strategic agents. In
particular, GCC protocols are guaranteed to have approximate subgame perfect
Nash equilibria, or even exact equilibria if the protocol's tie-breaking rule
is flexible. We further observe that the (approximate) equilibria of
proportional GCC protocols---which guarantee each of the $n$ agents a
$1/n$-fraction of the cake---must be (approximately) proportional. Finally, we
design a protocol in this framework with the property that its Nash equilibrium
allocations coincide with the set of (contiguous) envy-free allocations.

Myr after the coalescence of two gas-rich galaxies. Its location and kinematics
suggest it belongs to a stream of tidal-tail gas falling back into the remnant.
Its integrated [O III]_5007 luminosity is 1.4x10^40 erg/s, and its spectrum
features some high-excitation lines, including He II_4686. In diagnostic line-
ratio diagrams, the nebula lies in the domain of Seyfert galaxies, suggesting
that it is photoionized by a source with a power-law spectrum. Yet, a search
for AGN activity in NGC 7252 from X-rays to radio wavelengths yields no
detection, with the most stringent upper limit set by X-ray observations. The
upper luminosity limit of L_{2-10 keV,0} < 5x10^39 erg/s estimated for the
nucleus is ~10^3 times lower than the minimum ionizing luminosity of >5x10^42
erg/s necessary to excite the nebula. This large discrepancy suggests that the
nebula is a faint ionization echo excited by a mildly active nucleus that has
declined by ~3 orders of magnitude over the past 20,000-200,000 years. In many
ways this nebula resembles the prototypical `Hanny's Voorwerp' near IC 2497,
but its size is 3x smaller and its [O III] luminosity ~100x lower. We propose
that it be classified as an extended emission-line region (EELR). The [O III]
nebula is then the lowest-luminosity ionization echo and EELR discovered so
far, indicative of recent, probably sputtering AGN activity of Seyfert-like
intensity in NGC 7252.

of the first low-mass, metal-poor stars (< 1Msun) in the early universe.
Previous work has shown the existence of a critical dust-to-gas ratio, below
which dust thermal cooling cannot cause gas fragmentation. Assuming the first
dust is silicon-based, we compute critical dust-to-gas ratios and associated
critical silicon abundances ([Si/H]crit). At the density and temperature
associated with protostellar disks, we find that a standard Milky Way grain
size distribution gives [Si/H]crit = -4.5 +/- 0.1, while smaller grain sizes
created in a supernova reverse shock give [Si/H]crit = -5.3 +/- 0.1. Other
environments are not dense enough to be influenced by dust cooling. We test the
silicate dust cooling theory by comparing to silicon abundances observed in the
most iron-poor stars ([Fe/H] < -4.0). Several stars have silicon abundances low
enough to rule out dust-induced gas fragmentation with a standard grain size
distribution. Moreover, two of these stars have such low silicon abundances
that even dust with a shocked grain size distribution cannot explain their
formation. Adding small amounts of carbon dust does not significantly change
these conclusions. Additionally, we find that these stars exhibit either high
carbon with low silicon abundances or the reverse. A silicate dust scenario
thus suggests that the earliest low-mass star formation in the most metal-poor
regime may have proceeded through two distinct cooling pathways: fine structure
line cooling and dust cooling. This naturally explains both the carbon-rich and
carbon-normal stars at extremely low [Fe/H].

radiative transfer post-processing techniques to predict the expected free-free

roughly linearly with ionizing luminosity in both EUV and X-ray driven

partial optically thin at cm wavelengths. We perform a test observation of GM
Aur at 14-18 Ghz and detect an excess of radio emission above the dust tail to

large on-site inter-species repulsion, when the two species of fermions are
both at half-filling, two conventional ($s$-wave) number density waves are
formed with a $\pi$-phase difference between them to minimize the inter-species

density wave with $d_{xy}$-wave symmetry emerges. When both species are away

present results of a functional renormalization-group calculation that maps out

the emergence of the $d_{xy}$-density wave phase based on a four-patch model.
We find a robust and general mechanism for $d_{xy}$-density-wave formation that
is related to the shape and size of the Fermi surfaces. The density imbalance
between the two species of fermions in the vicinity of half-filling leads to
phase-space discrepancy for different inter-species Umklapp couplings. Using a

circumstellar material within ~1e16 cm of the progenitor was in excess of 10
solar masses, likely ejected tens of years prior to the SN explosion. Our
modeling suggests that the shock velocity during shock breakout was ~6000 km/s,
decelerating to ~2600 km/s about two years after maximum light. Our late-time
NuSTAR+XMM spectra of the SN presumably provide the first direct measurement of
SN shock velocity two years after the SN maximum light -- measured to be in the
range of 2000 to 4500 km/s if the ions and electrons are in equilibrium, and
>~2000 km/s if they are not in equilibrium. This measurement is in agreement
with the shock velocity predicted by our modeling of the optical data. We also
show that the mean radial density distribution of the CSM roughly follows an

significant distortion in the transit light curve is attributed to spin-orbit
misalignment between the transiting companion and the gravity darkened host
star. Our analysis was based on 11 Long Cadence and 2 Short Cadence transits of
KOI-368.01 from the Kepler mission, as well as stellar parameters determined
from our follow-up spectroscopic observation. We measured the true obliquity
between the orbit normal and the stellar rotation axis to be 69 +9/-10 deg. We
also find a secondary eclipse event with depth 29 +/- 3 ppm at phase 0.59, from
which the temperature of the companion is constrained to 3060 +/- 50 K,
indicating that KOI-368.01 is a late M-dwarf. The eccentricity is also
calculated from the eclipse to be 0.1429 +/- 0.0007. The long period, high
obliquity, and low eccentricity of KOI-368.01 allow us to limit a number of
proposed theories for the misalignment of binary systems.

statistically enhanced Faraday Rotation Measures (RM) indicating the presence

likely galaxies hosting the magneto-active plasma, and to constrain the
location of the latter with respect to the putative parent halo. We find that
all of the sightlines with high |RM| pass within 50 kpc of a galaxy and that
the |RM| distribution for low impact parameters, D < 50 kpc, is significantly
different than for larger impact parameters. In addition, we find a decrease in
the ratio of the polarization at 21 cm and 1.5 cm, p_{21}/p_{1.5}, towards
lower D. These two effects are most likely related, strengthen the association
of excess |RM| with intervening galaxies, and suggest that intervening galaxies
operate as inhomogeneous Faraday screens. These results are difficult to
reconciliate with only a disk model for the magnetic field but are consistent
with highly magnetized winds associated with MgII systems. We infer strong
magnetic fields of a few tens of mikro Gauss, consistent with values required
by the lack of evolution of the FIR-radio correlation at high redshifts.
Finally, these findings lends support to the idea that the small scale helicity
bottleneck of alpha-Omega galactic dynamos can be significantly alleviated via

through a sequence of mergers and continuous mass accretion, which generate
significant random gas motions especially in their outskirts where material is
actively accreting. Non-thermal pressure provided by the internal gas motions
affects the thermodynamic structure of the X-ray emitting intracluster plasma
and introduces biases in the physical interpretation of X-ray and
Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect observations. However, we know very little about the
nature of gas motions in galaxy clusters. The ASTRO-H X-ray mission, scheduled
to launch in 2015, will have a calorimeter capable of measuring gas motions in
galaxy clusters at the level of <100 km/s. In this work, we predict the level
of merger-induced gas motions expected in the Lambda-CDM model using
hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy cluster formation. We show that the gas
velocity dispersion is larger in more massive clusters, but exhibits a large
scatter. We show that systems with large gas motions are morphologically
disturbed, while early forming, relaxed groups show a smaller level of gas
motions. By analyzing mock ASTRO-H observations of simulated clusters, we show
that such observations can accurately measure the gas velocity dispersion out
to the outskirts of nearby relaxed galaxy clusters. ASTRO-H analysis of merging
clusters, on the other hand, requires multi-component spectral fitting and
enables unique studies of substructures in galaxy clusters by measuring both
the peculiar velocities and the velocity dispersion of gas within individual
sub-clusters.

one. Then, by applying a weak probe field on the cavity mode we are able to
distinguish those states without disturbing the atomic system, i.e., performing
a quantum non-demolition measurement via the cavity transmission. In this
scheme, one has nonzero cavity transmission only when the atomic system is in
an entangled state so that a single click in the detector is enough to ensure
that the atoms are in an maximally entangled state. Our scheme relies on an
interference effect as it happens in electromagnetically induced transparency
phenomenon so that it works out even in the limit of decay rate of the cavity

background and the global emissivity of ionizing photons over 2 < z < 5. Our
results are based on a suite of updated measurements of physical properties of
the high-redshift intergalactic medium (IGM), including gas temperatures and
the opacity of the IGM to Ly-alpha and ionizing photons. Consistent with
previous works, we find a relatively flat hydrogen photoionization rate over 2
< z < 5, although our measurements are roughly a factor of two higher than the
2008 values of Faucher-Giguere et al., due primarily to our lower gas
temperatures. The ionizing emissivity we derive is also generally higher than
other recent estimates due to a combination of lower gas temperatures, higher
ionizing opacity, and an accounting of cosmological radiative transfer effects.
We find evidence that the emissivity increases from z~3 to 5, reaching ~5
ionizing photons per atom per gigayear at z=4.75 for realistic galaxy spectra.
We further find that galaxies must dominate the emissivity near 1 Ryd at z > 4,
and possibly at all redshifts z > 2.4. Our results suggest that the
globally-averaged ionizing ""efficiency"" of star-forming galaxies increases
substantially with redshift over 3.2 < z < 4.75. This trend is consistent with
the conclusion often drawn from reionization models that the ionizing
efficiency of galaxies must be higher during reionization in order for galaxies
to reionize the IGM by z=6. Our emissivity values at z~5 suggest that ionizing
photons may have been a factor of two more abundant during the final stages of
reionization than previously indicated. The evolution of the ionizing
emissivity over 2 < z < 5 suggests, moreover, that the steep decline in the
photoionization rate from z~5 to 6 may indicate a rapid evolution in the mean
free path at z > 5.

compactifications on stacks and, in particular, gerbes. A heterotic string
compactification on a gerbe can be understood as, simultaneously, both a
compactification on a space with a restriction on nonperturbative sectors, and
also, a gauge theory in which a subgroup of the gauge group acts trivially on
the massless matter. Gerbes admit more bundles than corresponding spaces, which
suggests they are potentially a rich playground for heterotic string
compactifications. After we give a general characterization of heterotic
strings on stacks, we specialize to gerbes, and consider three different
classes of `building blocks' of gerbe compactifications. We argue that
heterotic string compactifications on one class is equivalent to
compactification of the same heterotic string on a disjoint union of spaces,
compactification on another class is dual to compactifications of other
heterotic strings on spaces, and compactification on the third class is not
perturbatively consistent, so that we do not in fact recover a broad array of
new heterotic compactifications, just combinations of existing ones. In
appendices we explain how to compute massless spectra of heterotic strings on
stacks, derive some new necessary conditions for a heterotic string on a stack
or orbifold to be well-defined, and also review some basic properties of
bundles on gerbes.

the effect of luminosity bursts, similar in magnitude to FUors and EXors, on
the gas-phase abundance of CO and CO_2 in the protostellar disk and infalling
envelope. The evolution of a young protostar and its environment is followed
based on hydrodynamical models using the thin-disk approximation, coupled with
a stellar evolution code and phase transformations of CO and CO_2. The
accretion and associated luminosity bursts in our model are caused by disk
gravitational fragmentation followed by quick migration of the fragments onto
the forming protostar. We found that bursts with luminosity on the order of
100-200 L_sun can evaporate CO ices in part of the envelope. The typical
freeze-out time of the gas-phase CO onto dust grains in the envelope (a few
kyr) is much longer than the burst duration (100-200 yr). This results in an
increased abundance of the gas-phase CO in the envelope long after the system
has returned into a quiescent stage. In contrast, luminosity bursts can
evaporate CO_2 ices only in the disk, where the freeze-out time of the
gas-phase CO_2 is comparable to the burst duration. We thus confirm that
luminosity bursts can leave long-lasting traces in the abundance of gas-phase
CO in the infalling envelope, enabling the detection of recent bursts as
suggested by previous semi-analytical studies.

interesting properties and diverse applications. One property that has been
particularly useful is negative correlation of the resulting vector.
Unfortunately negative correlation has its limitations, and there are some
further desirable properties that do not seem to follow from existing
techniques. In particular, recent concentration results for sums of independent
random matrices are not known to extend to a negatively dependent setting.
  We introduce a simple but useful technique called concavity of pessimistic
estimators. This technique allows us to show concentration of submodular
functions and concentration of matrix sums under pipage rounding. The former
result answers a question of Chekuri et al. (2009). To prove the latter result,
we derive a new variant of Lieb's celebrated concavity theorem in matrix
analysis.
  We provide numerous applications of these results. One is to spectrally-thin
trees, a spectral analog of the thin trees that played a crucial role in the
recent breakthrough on the asymmetric traveling salesman problem. We show a
polynomial time algorithm that, given a graph where every edge has effective
conductance at least $\kappa$, returns an $O(\kappa^{-1} \cdot \log n / \log
\log n)$-spectrally-thin tree. There are further applications to rounding of
semidefinite programs, to the column subset selection problem, and to a
geometric question of extracting a nearly-orthonormal basis from an isotropic
distribution.

receivers through a sequence of coded transmissions. All receivers overhear the
same transmissions. Each receiver may already have some of the packets as side
information, and requests another subset of the packets. This problem is known
as the index coding problem and can be represented by a bipartite digraph. An
integer linear program is developed that provides a lower bound on the minimum
number of transmissions required for any coding algorithm. Conversely, its
linear programming relaxation is shown to provide an upper bound that is
achievable by a simple form of vector linear coding. Thus, the information
theoretic optimum is bounded by the integrality gap between the integer program
and its linear relaxation. In the special case when the digraph has a planar
structure, the integrality gap is shown to be zero, so that exact optimality is
achieved. Finally, for non-planar problems, an enhanced integer program is
constructed that provides a smaller integrality gap. The dual of this problem
corresponds to a more sophisticated partial clique coding strategy that
time-shares between Reed-Solomon erasure codes. This work illuminates the
relationship between index coding, duality, and integrality gaps between
integer programs and their linear relaxations.

empirical networks, implies that there are local regions of large sparse
networks that are dense. We call this the blessing of transitivity and it has
consequences for both modeling and inference. Extant research suggests that
statistical inference for the Stochastic Blockmodel is more difficult when the
edges are sparse. However, this conclusion is confounded by the fact that the
asymptotic limit in all of the previous studies is not merely sparse, but also
non-transitive. To retain transitivity, the blocks cannot grow faster than the
expected degree. Thus, in sparse models, the blocks must remain asymptotically
small. \n Previous algorithmic research demonstrates that small ""local""
clusters are more amenable to computation, visualization, and interpretation
when compared to ""global"" graph partitions. This paper provides the first
statistical results that demonstrate how these small transitive clusters are
also more amenable to statistical estimation. Theorem 2 shows that a ""local""
clustering algorithm can, with high probability, detect a transitive stochastic
block of a fixed size (e.g. 30 nodes) embedded in a large graph. The only
constraint on the ambient graph is that it is large and sparse--it could be
generated at random or by an adversary--suggesting a theoretical explanation
for the robust empirical performance of local clustering algorithms.

have reawakened interest in the old and fascinating phenomenon of solar
tornado-like prominences. This class of prominences was first introduced by
Pettit (1932), who studied them over many years. Observations of tornado
prominences similar to the ones seen by SDO had already been documented by
Secchi (1877) in his famous ""Le Soleil"". High resolution and high cadence
multiwavelength data obtained by SDO reveal that the tornado-like appearance of
these prominences is mainly an illusion due to projection effects. We discuss
two different cases where prominences on the limb might appear to have a
tornado-like behavior. One case of apparent vortical motions in prominence
spines and barbs arises from the (mostly) 2D counterstreaming plasma motion
along the prominence spine and barbs together with oscillations along
individual threads. The other case of apparent rotational motion is observed in
prominence cavities and results from the 3D plasma motion along the writhed
magnetic fields inside and along the prominence cavity as seen projected on the
limb. Thus, the ""tornado"" impression results either from counterstreaming and
oscillations or from the projection on the plane of the sky of plasma motion
along magnetic field lines, rather than from a true vortical motion around an
(apparent) vertical or horizontal axis. We discuss the link between
tornado-like prominences, filament barbs, and photospheric vortices at their
base.

penalties is computationally efficient. In this paper we make an attempt to
combine their strengths, and propose a simple approach that penalizes the
likelihood with data-dependent $\ell_1$ penalties as in adaptive Lasso and
exploits a fixed penalization parameter. Even for finite samples, its model
selection results approximately coincide with those based on information
criteria; in particular, we show that in some special cases, this approach and
the corresponding information criterion produce exactly the same model. One can
also consider this approach as a way to directly determine the penalization
parameter in adaptive Lasso to achieve information criteria-like model
selection. As extensions, we apply this idea to complex models including
Gaussian mixture model and mixture of factor analyzers, whose model selection
is traditionally difficult to do; by adopting suitable penalties, we provide
continuous approximators to the corresponding information criteria, which are
easy to optimize and enable efficient model selection.

with high curvature act as sinks for the diffusion of domain walls. The pinning
of grain boundaries at regions of low curvature leads to the formation of a
metastable structure of defects, characterized by asymptotically slow dynamics
of ordering and activation energies dictated by the largest curvatures of the
system. These glassy-like ordering dynamics may completely inhibit the
appearance of the ground state structures.

used in domains such as systems biology and neuroscience to gain insight into
the underlying processes that produce observed data. Learning reliable networks
from limited data is difficult, therefore transfer learning can improve the
robustness of learned networks by leveraging data from related tasks. Existing
transfer learning algorithms for Bayesian network structure learning give a
single maximum a posteriori estimate of network models. Yet, many other models
may be equally likely, and so a more informative result is provided by Bayesian
structure discovery. Bayesian structure discovery algorithms estimate posterior
probabilities of structural features, such as edges. We present transfer
learning for Bayesian structure discovery which allows us to explore the shared
and unique structural features among related tasks. Efficient computation
requires that our transfer learning objective factors into local calculations,
which we prove is given by a broad class of transfer biases. Theoretically, we
show the efficiency of our approach. Empirically, we show that compared to
single task learning, transfer learning is better able to positively identify
true edges. We apply the method to whole-brain neuroimaging data.

the queue state information (QSI) to minimize the average delay cost subject to
average backhaul consumption constraints and average power constraints. The
delay-optimal control problem is formulated as an infinite horizon average cost
constrained partially observed Markov decision process (CPOMDP). By exploiting
the special structure in our problem, we derive an equivalent Bellman Equation
to solve the CPOMDP. To reduce computational complexity and facilitate
distributed implementation, we propose a distributed online learning algorithm

a distributed online stochastic partial gradient algorithm to obtain the power

based on local observations of the system states at the BSs and is very robust

processes and noncolliding random walk are determinantal is simply explained by
the fact that the harmonic transform with the Vandermonde determinant provides
a proper determinantal martingale. Recently O'Connell introduced an interesting
IPS, which can be regarded as a stochastic version of a quantum Toda lattice.
It is a geometric lifting of the noncolliding Brownian motion and is not
determinantal, but Borodin and Corwin discovered a determinant formula for a
special observable for it. We also discuss this new topic from the present
view-point of determinantal martingale.

hydrodynamic phenomena by combining hydrophobicity and roughness to trap gas
bubbles in microscopic textures. Recent works in this area have focused on
specific cases of superhydrophobic stripes. Here we provide some theoretical
results to guide the optimization of the forward flow and transverse
hydrodynamic phenomena in a parallel-plate channel with a superhydrophobic
trapezoidal texture, varying on scales larger than the channel thickness. The
permeability of such a thin channel is shown to be equivalent to that of a
striped one with greater average slip. The maximization of a transverse flow
normally requires largest possible slip at the gas areas, similarly to a
striped channel. However, in case of trapezoidal textures with a very small
fraction of the solid phase this maximum occurs at a finite slip at the gas
areas. Exact numerical calculations show that our analysis, based on a
lubrication theory, can also be applied for a larger gap. However, in this case
it overestimates a permeability of the channel, and underestimates an
anisotropy of the flow. Our results provide a framework for the rational design
of superhydrophobic surfaces for microfluidic applications.

obtain state-dependent entropic bounds for a single general SIC-POVM. Lower
entropic bounds are derived in terms of the R\'{e}nyi $\alpha$-entropies for
$\alpha\in[2;\infty)$ and the Tsallis $\alpha$-entropies for $\alpha\in(0;2]$.
A lower bound on the min-entropy of a SIC-POVM is separately examined. For a

Lee-Yang-Parr correlation energy functional is used. First, all the 8 n=2

relatively less studied in the literature compared to the remaining 4 members.
Then calculations are performed for the 8 $2l2l'$n$l""$ (3$\leq$n$\leq$6) hollow

illustration, higher resonance positions of the 2s$^2$ns $^2$S$^e$ series are
calculated for all the ions with a maximum of n=25. The excitation energies
calculated from this single-determinantal approach are in excellent agreement
with the available literature data (for the n=2 intrashell states the deviation
is within 0.125% and excepting only one case, the same for the resonance series
is well below 0.50%). With an increase in Z, the deviations tend to decrease.
Radial densities are also presented for some of the selected states. The only
result available in the literature for the lower resonances (corresponding to a
maximum of n=17) have been reported very recently. The n$>$16 ($>17$ for

promising viable and general DFT scheme for the accurate calculation of these

onto the newborn compact object is thought to power long gamma ray bursts

by the angular momentum distribution in the progenitor, and the physical
conditions make neutrino emission the main cooling agent in the flow. The
formation and evolution of structure in these disks is potentially very
relevant for the energy release and its time variability, which ultimately
imprint on the observed GRB properties. To begin to characterize these, taking
into account the three dimensional nature of the problem, we have carried out
an initial set of calculations of the collapse of rotating polytropic cores in
three dimensions, making use of a pseudo-relativistic potential and a
simplified cooling prescription. We focus on the effects of self gravity and
cooling on the overall morphology and evolution of the flow for a given
rotation rate in the context of the collapsar model. For the typical cooling
times expected in such a scenario we observe the appearance of strong
instabilities on the cooling time scale following disk formation, which
modulate the properties of the flow. Such instabilities, and the interaction
they produce between the disk and the central object lead to significant
variability in the obtained mass accretion and energy loss rates, which will
likely translate into variations in the power of the relativistic outflow that
ultimately results in a GRB.

We quantify the power released by magnetic reconnection at the boundary of the

electrons. We introduce simple models to evaluate the energy spectrum of the
accelerated electrons and the energy dissipated in the atmospheric layers in
the polar regions of the planet upon which they impinge. A simple transonic
isothermal wind flow along field lines is considered to estimate the increase
in mass loss rate in comparison with a planet irradiated only by the EUV flux
of its host star. We find that energetic electrons can reach levels down to
column densities of 10^{23}-10^{25} m^{-2}, comparable with or deeper than EUV
photons, and increase the mass loss rate up to a factor of 30-50 in close-in (<
0.10 AU), massive (> 1.5 Jupiter masses) planets. Mass loss rates up to
(0.5-1.0)x10^{9} kg/s are found for atmospheres heated by electrons accelerated

the case of magnetic loops interconnecting the planet with the star. The
star-planet magnetic interaction provides a remarkable source of energy for

studied regularization models with various types of low-dimensional structures.
In such settings, the general approach is to solve a regularized optimization
problem, which combines a data fidelity term and some regularization penalty
that promotes the assumed low-dimensional/simple structure. This paper provides
a general framework to capture this low-dimensional structure through what we
coin partly smooth functions relative to a linear manifold. These are convex,
non-negative, closed and finite-valued functions that will promote objects
living on low-dimensional subspaces. This class of regularizers encompasses
many popular examples such as the L1 norm, L1-L2 norm (group sparsity), as well
as several others including the Linfty norm. We also show that the set of
partly smooth functions relative to a linear manifold is closed under addition
and pre-composition by a linear operator, which allows to cover mixed
regularization, and the so-called analysis-type priors (e.g. total variation,
fused Lasso, finite-valued polyhedral gauges). Our main result presents a
unified sharp analysis of exact and robust recovery of the low-dimensional
subspace model associated to the object to recover from partial measurements.
This analysis is illustrated on a number of special and previously studied
cases, and on an analysis of the performance of Linfty regularization in a
compressed sensing scenario.

$1 \pm \varepsilon$ relative error for counting and generating uniformly at
random a labeled DAG with a given number of vertices. This is accomplished
starting from a classical recurrence for counting DAGs, whose values we
approximate by floating-point numbers.
  After extending these results to other families of DAGs, we show how the same
approach works also with problems where we are given a compact representation
of a combinatorial ensemble and we are asked to count and sample elements from
it. We employ here the floating-point approximation method to transform the
classic pseudo-polynomial algorithm for counting 0/1 Knapsack solutions into a
very simple FPTAS with $1 - \varepsilon$ relative error. Its complexity
improves upon the recent result (\v{S}tefankovi\v{c} et al., SIAM J. Comput.,
2012), and, when $\varepsilon^{-1} = \Omega(n)$, also upon the best-known
randomized algorithm (Dyer, STOC, 2003). To show the versatility of this
technique, we also apply it to a recent generalization of the problem of
counting 0/1 Knapsack solutions in an arc-weighted DAG, obtaining a faster and
simpler FPTAS than the existing one.

characterized by the presence of successive power-law regimes with various
scattering exponents whose values vary from -4 to -1. This usually indicates
multiple fractal structures of the sample characterized by different size
scales. The existing models explaining the crossover positions (that is, the
points where the power-law scattering exponent changes) involve only one
contrast parameter, which depends solely on the ratio of the fractal sizes.
Here, a model that describes SAS from a multi-phase system with a few contrast
parameters is described, and it is shown that the crossover position depends on
the scattering length density of each phase. The Stuhrmann contrast variation
method is generalized and applied to experimental curves in the vicinity of the
crossover point beyond the Guinier region. The contrast variation is applied
not to the intensity itself but to the model parameters, which can be found by
fitting the experimental data with the suggested interpolation formula. The
model supplements the existing two-phase models and gives the simple condition
of their inapplicability: if the crossover point depends on the contrast then a
two-phase model is not relevant. The developed analysis allows one to answer
the qualitative question of whether one fractal `absorbs' another one or they
are both immersed in a surrounding homogeneous medium like a solvent or solid
matrix. The models can be applied to experimental SAS data where the absolute
value of the scattering exponent of the first power-law regime is higher than
that of the subsequent second power-law regime, that is, the scattering curve
is `convex' near the crossover point. As is shown, the crossover position can
be very sensitive to contrast variation, which influences significantly the
length of the fractal range.

survey of nearby clusters, we address here the long debated question of the
origin and shape of the Fundamental Plane (FP). Our data suggest that different
physical mechanisms concur in shaping and tilting the FP with respect to the
virial plane (VP) expectation. In particular, an hybrid solution in which the
structure of galaxies and their stellar population are the main contributors to
the FP tilt seems to be favoured. We find that the bulk of the tilt should be
attributed to structural non-homology, while stellar population effects play an
important but less crucial role. Our data indicate that the differential FP
tilt between the V and K-band is due to a sort of entanglement between
structural and stellar population effects, for which the inward steepening of
color profiles (V-K) tends to increase at increasing the stellar mass of ETGs.
The same analysis applied to the ATLAS3D and SDSS data in common with WINGS
(WSDSS throughout the paper) confirms our results, the only remarkable
difference being the less important role of the stellar mass-to-light-ratio in
determining the FP tilt. The ATLAS3D data also suggest that the tilt depends as
well on the dark matter (DM) fraction and on the rotational contribution to the
kinetic energy (Vrot/sigma). We show that the global properties of the FP can
be understood in terms of the underlying correlation among mass, structure and
stellar population of ETGs, for which, at increasing the stellar mass, ETGs
become (on average) older and more centrally concentrated. Finally, we show
that a Malmquist-like selection effect may mimic a differential evolution of
the mass-to-light ratio for galaxies of different masses. This should be taken
into account in the studies investigating the amount of the so called
downsizing phenomenon.

formed in SrTiO3 nanostructures. Our the- oretical analysis is based on the
three-orbital model, which takes into account t2g orbitals of Ti ions. Because
of the interfacial breaking of mirror symmetry, a Rashba-type antisymmetric
spin-orbit coupling arises from the cooperation of intersite and interorbital
hybridyzation and atomic LS coupling. This model shows a characteristic spin
texture and carrier density dependence of Rashba spin-orbit coupling through
the orbital degree of freedom. Superconductivity is mainly caused by heavy
quasiparticles consisting of dyz and dzx orbitals at high carrier densities. We
find that the Rashba spin-orbit coupling stabilizes a quasi-one-dimensional
superconducting phase caused by one of the dyz or dzx orbitals at high magnetic
fields along interfaces. This quasi-one-dimensional superconducting phase is
protected against para- magnetic depairing effects by the Rashba spin-orbit
coupling and realizes a large upper critical field Hc2 beyond the
Pauli-Clogston-Chandrasekhar limit. This finding is consistent with an
extraordinarily large upper critical field observed in SrTiO3 /LaAlO3
interfaces and its carrier density dependence. The possible coexistence of
superconductivity and fer- romagnetism in SrTiO3 /LaAlO3 interfaces may also be
attributed to this quasi-one-dimensional superconducting phase.

regime two decoupled groups of four families of quarks and leptons. In two
successive breaks the massless families, first the group of four and at the

are identical with respect to the charges and spin. There are two kinds of
fields in this theory, which manifest at low energies as the gauge vector and
scalar fields: the fields which couple to the charges and spin, and the fields
which couple to the family quantum numbers. In loop corrections to the tree
level mass matrices both kinds start to contribute coherently. The fourth
family of the lower group of four families is predicted to be possibly observed
at the LHC and the stable of the higher four families -- the fifth family -- is
the candidate to constitute the dark matter. Properties of the families of

Mpc. Our observations with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array show that this
event is radio-loud: PTF11qcj reached a radio peak luminosity comparable to
that of the famous gamma-ray-burst-associated supernova 1998bw (L_{5GHz} ~
10^{29} erg/s/Hz). PTF11qcj is also detected in X-rays with the Chandra
observatory, and in the infrared band with Spitzer. Our multi-wavelength
analysis probes the supernova interaction with circumstellar material. The
radio observations suggest a progenitor mass-loss rate of ~10^{-4} Msun/yr x
(v_w/1000 km/s), and a velocity of ~(0.3-0.5)c for the fastest moving ejecta
(at ~10d after explosion). However, these estimates are derived assuming the
simplest model of supernova ejecta interacting with a smooth circumstellar
material characterized by radial power-law density profile, and do not account
for possible inhomogeneities in the medium and asphericity of the explosion.
The radio light curve shows deviations from such a simple model, as well as a
re-brightening at late times. The X-ray flux from PTF11qcj is compatible with
the high-frequency extrapolation of the radio synchrotron emission (within the
large uncertainties). An IR light echo from pre-existing dust is in agreement
with our infrared data. Our analysis of pre-explosion data from the Palomar
Transient Factory suggests that a precursor eruption of absolute magnitude M_r
~ -13 mag may have occurred ~ 2.5 yr prior to the supernova explosion. Based on
our panchromatic follow-up campaign, we conclude that PTF11qcj fits the
expectations from the explosion of a Wolf-Rayet star. Precursor eruptions may
be a feature characterizing the final pre-explosion evolution of such stars.

the atmospheric parameters and abundances of a large number of stars using
measurements of equivalent widths as automatic and as independent of any
subjective approach as possible. It is based on the simultaneous search for
three equilibria: excitation equilibrium, ionization balance, and the
relationship between \fei\ and the reduced equivalent widths. FAMA also
evaluates the statistical errors on individual element abundances and errors
due to the uncertainties in the stellar parameters. The convergence criteria
are not fixed 'a priori' but are based on the quality of the spectra. In this
paper we present tests performed on the Solar spectrum EWs which tests the
dependency on the initial parameters, and the analysis of a sample of stars
observed in Galactic open and globular clusters.

inversion. We also discuss the charge distribution inside discharge trees,
which provides a natural explanation for the observed reconnections of

for excursion sets of three- and two-dimensional smooth Gaussian random fields,
and numerically investigate the Betti numbers as a function of threshold level.
Betti numbers are topological invariants of figures that can be used to
distinguish topological spaces. In the case of the excursion sets of a
three-dimensional field there are three possibly non-zero Betti numbers;
$\beta_0$ is the number of connected regions, $\beta_1$ is the number of
circular holes, and $\beta_2$ is the number of three-dimensional voids. Their
sum with alternating signs is the genus of the surface of excursion regions. It
is found that each Betti number has a dominant contribution to the genus in a
specific threshold range. $\beta_0$ dominates the high-threshold part of the
genus curve measuring the abundance of high density regions (clusters).
$\beta_1$ dominates the genus near the median thresholds which measures the
topology of negatively curved iso-density surfaces, and $\beta_2$ corresponds
to the low-threshold part measuring the void abundance. We average the Betti
number curves (the Betti numbers as a function of the threshold level) over
many realizations of Gaussian fields and find that both the amplitude and shape
of the Betti number curves depend on the slope of the power spectrum $n$ in
such a way that their shape becomes broader and their amplitude drops less
steeply than the genus as $n$ decreases. This behaviour contrasts with the fact
that the shape of the genus curve is fixed for all Gaussian fields regardless
of the power spectrum. Even though the Gaussian Betti number curves should be
calculated for each given power spectrum, we propose to use the Betti numbers
for better specification of the topology of large scale structures in the
universe.

superfluid-Mott insulator transition of polaritons (i.e., dressed photon-qubit
states) in coupled qubit-cavity arrays in the crossover from strong to weak
correlations. In the strongly correlated regime the phase diagram and the
elementary excitations of lattice polaritons near the Mott lobes are calculated
analytically using a slave boson theory (SBT). The opposite regime of weakly
interacting polariton superfluids is described by a weak-coupling mean-field
theory (MFT) for a generalised multi-mode Dicke model. We show that a
remarkable relation between the two theories exists in the limit of large
photon bandwidth and large negative detuning, i.e., when the nature of
polariton quasiparticles becomes qubit-like. In this regime, the weak coupling
theory predicts the existence of a single Mott lobe with a change of the
universality class of the phase transition at the tip of the lobe, in perfect
agreement with the slave-boson theory. Moreover, the spectra of low energy
excitations, i.e., the sound velocity of the Goldstone mode and the gap of the
amplitude mode match exactly as calculated from both theories.

optical anisotropy of the medium, the direction of propagation of the pump

where automatic photon quenching is relevant, we calculate analytically the
emergent steady-state gamma-ray spectra. We perform also numerical calculations

{\Gamma} is the photon index of the power-law at injection. Thus, large
spectral breaks of the gamma-ray photon spectrum, e.g. $\Delta \Gamma \gtrsim

variability of the solar irradiance that in turn is thought to influence the
climate on Earth. The magnetic field manifests itself in the form of structures
of largely different sizes. This thesis concentrates on two types of the
smallest known magnetic features: The first part studies the properties of
umbral dots, dot-like bright features in the dark umbra of a sunspot. The
obtained umbral dot properties provide a remarkable confirmation of the results
of recent magneto-hydrodynamical simulations. Observations as well as
simulations show that umbral dots differ from their surroundings mainly in the
lowest photospheric layers, where the temperature is enhanced and the magnetic
field is weakened. In addition, the interior of the umbral dots displays strong
upflow velocities which are surrounded by weak downflows. This qualitative
agreement further strengthens the interpretation of umbral dots as localized
columns of overturning convection. The second part of the thesis investigates
bright points, which are small-scale brightness enhancements in the darker
intergranular lanes of the quiet Sun produced by magnetic flux concentrations.
Observational data obtained by the balloon-borne solar telescope SUNRISE are
used in this thesis. For the first time contrasts of bright points in the
important ultraviolet spectral range are determined. A comparison of
observational data with magneto-hydrodynamical simulations revealed a close
correspondence, but only after effects due to the limited spectral and spatial
resolution were carefully included. 98% of the synthetic bright points are
found to be associated with a nearly vertical kilo-Gauss field.

designed transmit beamforming. We assume single user detection at the MS by
treating the interference as noise. By taking into account a realistic power
model at the BS, we characterize the Pareto boundary of the achievable energy
efficiency (EE) region of the $K$ links, where the EE of each link is defined
as the achievable data rate at the MS divided by the total power consumption at
the BS. Since the EE of each link is non-cancave (which is a non-concave
function over an affine function), characterizing this boundary is difficult.
To meet this challenge, we relate this multi-cell MISO system to cognitive
radio (CR) MISO channels by applying the concept of interference temperature
(IT), and accordingly transform the EE boundary characterization problem into a
set of fractional concave programming problems. Then, we apply the fractional
concave programming technique to solve these fractional concave problems, and
correspondingly give a parametrization for the EE boundary in terms of IT
levels. Based on this characterization, we further present a decentralized
algorithm to implement the multi-cell coordinated beamforming, which is shown

belt where they are unexpected according to dynamical models of implantation of
bodies from the outer solar system into the inner solar system during planetary

  Confidential Messages and Partial CSIT","31 pages",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In wiretap channels the eavesdropper's channel state information (CSI) is
commonly assumed to be known at transmitter, fully or partially. However, under
perfect secrecy constraint the eavesdropper may not be motivated to feedback
any correct CSI. In this paper we consider a more feasible problem for the
transmitter to have eavesdropper's CSI. That is, the fast fading
multiple-antenna Gaussian broadcast channels (FMGBC-CM) with confidential
messages, where both receivers are legitimate users such that they both are
willing to feedback accurate CSI to maintain their secure transmission, and not
to be eavesdropped by the other. We assume that only the statistics of the
channel state information are known by the transmitter. We first show the
necessary condition for the FMGBC-CM not to be degraded to the common wiretap
channels. Then we derive the achievable rate region for the FMGBC-CM where the
channel input covariance matrices and the inflation factor are left unknown and
to be solved. After that we provide an analytical solution to the channel input
covariance matrices. We also propose an iterative algorithm to solve the
channel input covariance matrices and the inflation factor. Due to the
complicated rate region formulae in normal SNR, we resort to low SNR analysis
to investigate the characteristics of the channel. Finally, numerical examples
show that under perfect secrecy constraint both users can achieve positive
rates simultaneously, which verifies our derived necessary condition. Numerical
results also elucidate the effectiveness of the analytic solution and proposed
algorithm of solving the channel input covariance matrices and the inflation
factor under different conditions.

result is that in practice our power-expected-posterior (PEP) methodology is
sufficiently insensitive to the size n* of the training sample, due to PEP's
unit-information construction, that one may take n* equal to the full-data
sample size n and dispense with training samples altogether. In this paper we
focus on Gaussian linear models and develop our method under two different
baseline prior choices: the independence Jeffreys (or reference) prior,
yielding the J-PEP posterior, and the Zellner g-prior, leading to Z-PEP. We
find that, under the reference baseline prior, the asymptotics of PEP Bayes
factors are equivalent to those of Schwartz's BIC criterion, ensuring
consistency of the PEP approach to model selection. We compare the performance
of our method, in simulation studies and a real example involving prediction of
air-pollutant concentrations from meteorological covariates, with that of a
variety of previously-defined variants on Bayes factors for objective variable
selection. Our prior, due to its unit-information structure, leads to a
variable-selection procedure that (1) is systematically more parsimonious than
the basic EPP with minimal training sample, while sacrificing no desirable
performance characteristics to achieve this parsimony; (2) is robust to the
size of the training sample, thus enjoying the advantages described above
arising from the avoidance of training samples altogether; and (3) identifies
maximum-a-posteriori models that achieve good out-of-sample predictive
performance.

the formation of a very massive star (above 100 Msun). In the past the study of
the long-term evolution of merger remnants has mostly focussed on collisions
between low-mass stars (up to about 2 Msun) in the context of blue-straggler
formation. The evolution of collision products of more massive stars has not
been as thoroughly investigated. In this paper we study the long-term evolution
of a number of stellar mergers formed by the head-on collision of a primary
star with a mass of 5-40 Msun with a lower mass star at three points in its
evolution in order to better understand their evolution.
  We use smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) calculations to model the
collision between the stars. The outcome of this calculation is reduced to one
dimension and imported into a stellar evolution code. We follow the subsequent
evolution of the collision product through the main sequence at least until the
onset of helium burning.
  We find that little hydrogen is mixed into the core of the collision
products, in agreement with previous studies of collisions between low-mass
stars. For collisions involving evolved stars we find that during the merger
the surface nitrogen abundance can be strongly enhanced. The evolution of most
of the collision products proceeds analogously to that of normal stars with the
same mass, but with a larger radius and luminosity. However, the evolution of
collision products that form with a hydrogen depleted core is markedly
different from that of normal stars with the same mass. They undergo a
long-lived period of hydrogen shell burning close to the main-sequence band in
the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and spend the initial part of core helium
burning as compact blue supergiants.

but, according to results of Monte Carlo simulations, the behavior of the model
at the extinction transition is different from the (infinite randomness)
critical behavior of the disordered, symmetric contact process. Depending on
the strength $a$ of the asymmetry, the critical population drifts either with a
finite velocity or with an asymptotically vanishing velocity as $x(t)\sim

the extinction transition; the survival probability, for instance, shows
multiscaling, i.e. it is characterized by a broad spectrum of effective
exponents. For a sufficiently weak asymmetry, a Griffiths phase appears below
the extinction transition, where the survival probability decays as a
non-universal power of the time while, above the transition, another extended
phase emerges, where the front of the population advances anomalously with a

various electronic models and also electron-phonon models. In this study we
investigate the properties of superconductivity in correlated-electron systems
by using numerical methods such as the variational Monte Carlo method and the

  The Hubbard model is one of basic models for strongly correlated electron

superconducting condensation energy obtained by adopting the Gutzwiller ansatz
is in reasonable agreement with the condensation energy estimated for
YBa_2Cu_3O_7. We show the phase diagram of the ground state using this method.
We have further investigated the stability of striped and checkerboard states
in the under-doped region. The relationship of the hole density x and
incommensurability \delta, \delta\sim x, is satisfied in the lower doping
region, as indicated by the variational Monte Carlo calculations. We have
performed a variational Monte Carlo simulation on a two-dimensional t-t'-t""-U

period checkerboard spin modulation, that is characterized by multi Q vectors,

method that is a method for the evaluation of expectation values without the
negative sign difficulty. We show that the pair correlation function is not
enhanced at half-filling, and is indeed enhanced with hole doping.

contractions and expansions around the mean (915.4 billion Euros, s.e.=3.59

Such frequent and intense fluctuations are frequently ascribed to exogenous
Basel II procyclical effects on credit flow into the economy and, consequently,
Basel III output based point in time Credit to GDP countercyclical buffering
advocated. We have tested the opposite null hypotheses that such variation is
significantly correlated to actual default rates, and that such correlation is
explained by fluctuations of credit supply around a steady state. We have found
that, in the period June 2008 to June 2012 (n=17), linear regression of credit
growth rates on default rates reveals a negative correlation of r=minus 0.6903
with R squared=0.4765, and that credit supply fluctuates steadily around the
default rate with an Internal Steady State Parameter SSP=0.00245 with chi
squared=37.47 (v=16, P<.005). We conclude that fluctuations of the total credit
used by non-financial corporations are exhaustively explained by variation of
the independent variable default rate, and that credit variation fluctuates
around a steady state. We conclude that credit risk management in Italy has
been effective in parameterizing credit supply variation to default rates

high-temperature dynamics as expressed through the mean-square displacement,
the stress autocorrelation function, and rotational relaxation. The diffusivity
of the individual molecules changes little as a function of temperature and
reveals distinct dynamical time scales as a result of the different
constituents in the system. Different time scales are also observed for the
rotational relaxation. The stress autocorrelation function features a slow

autocorrelation function, the shear viscosity and shear modulus are evaluated

length $H$ composed of hard inner walls. Patterning in the cavity is governed
by surface-induced order, capillary and frustration effects, and depends on the
relative values of particle aspect ratio $\kappa\equiv L/\sigma$, with $L$ the
length and $\sigma$ the width of the rectangles ($L\ge\sigma$), and cavity size
$H$. Ordering may be very different from bulk ($H\to\infty$) behaviour when $H$
is a few times the particle length $L$ (nanocavity). Bulk and confinement
properties are obtained for the cases $\kappa=1$, 3 and 6. In the confined
fluid surface-induced frustration leads to four-fold symmetry breaking in all
phases (which become two-fold symmetric). Since no director distorsion can
arise in our model by construction, frustration in the director orientation is
relaxed by the creation of domain walls (where the director changes by
$90^{\circ}$); this configuration is necessary to stabilise periodic phases.
For $\kappa=1$ the crystal becomes stable with commensuration transitions
taking place as $H$ is varied. In the case $\kappa=3$ the commensuration
transitions involve columnar phases with different number of columns. Finally,
in the case $\kappa=6$, the high-density region of the phase diagram is
dominated by commensuration transitions between smectic structures; at lower
densities there is a symmetry-breaking isotropic $\to$ nematic transition
exhibiting non-monotonic behaviour with cavity size.

and control in functional programming languages. In this paper we introduce an
affine bounded linear typing discipline on a general notion of resource which
can be modeled in a semiring. For this type system we provide both a general
type-inference procedure, parameterized by the decision procedure of the
semiring equational theory, and a (coherent) categorical semantics. This is a
very useful type-theoretic and denotational framework for many applications to
resource-sensitive compilation, and it represents a generalization of several
existing type systems. As a non-trivial instance, motivated by our ongoing work
on hardware compilation, we present a complex new application to calculating
and controlling timing of execution in a (recursion-free) higher-order
functional programming language with local store.

Navier-Fourier-Stokes (NFS) theory. The next-to-leading order relativistic
corrections to the NFS theory for the Landau-Lifshitz fluid are obtained. While
the lowest order truncation of the velocity expansion leads to the usual NFS
equations of nonrelativistic fluids, we show that when the next-to-leading
order relativistic corrections are included, the equations can be expressed
concurrently with two different fluid velocities. One of the fluid velocities
is parallel to the conserved charge current (which follows the Eckart
definition) and the other one is parallel to the energy current (which follows
the Landau-Lifshitz definition). We compare this next-to-leading order
relativistic hydrodynamics with bivelocity hydrodynamics, which is one of the
generalizations of the NFS theory and is formulated in such a way to include
the usual mass velocity and also a new velocity, called the volume velocity. We
find that the volume velocity can be identified with the velocity obtained in
the Landau-Lifshitz definition. Then, the structure of bivelocity
hydrodynamics, which is derived using various nontrivial assumptions, is
reproduced in the NFS theory including the next-to-leading order relativistic

laser is needed to drive the $^{2}D_{3/2}$ $\rightarrow$ $^{3}D_{[3/2]1/2}$
transition which is followed by rapid decay to the $^{2}S_{1/2}$ state. Our
369nm laser is locked to Yb$^{+}$ ions generated in a hollow cathode discharge
lamp using saturated absorption spectroscopy. Without pumping, the metastable
$^{2}D_{3/2}$ level is only sparsely populated and direct absorption of 935nm
light is difficult to detect. A resonant 369nm laser is able to significantly
populate the $^{2}D_{3/2}$ state due to the coupling between the levels. Fast
re-pumping to the $^{2}S_{1/2}$ state, by 935nm light, can be detected by
observing the change in absorption of the 369nm laser using lock-in detection
of the photodiode signal. In this way simultaneous locking of two optical
frequencies in very different spectral regimes is accomplished. A rate equation
model gives good qualitative agreement with the experimental results. This
technique offers improved laser frequency stabilization compared to lasers
locked individually to the sample and should be readily applicable to similar
ion systems.

"1307.2483","Lewis Tseng","Nitin H. Vaidya","Iterative Byzantine Vector Consensus in Incomplete Graphs",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work addresses Byzantine vector consensus (BVC), wherein the input at
each process is a d-dimensional vector of reals, and each process is expected
to decide on a decision vector that is in the convex hull of the input vectors
at the fault-free processes [3, 8]. The input vector at each process may also
be viewed as a point in the d-dimensional Euclidean space R^d, where d > 0 is a
finite integer. Recent work [3, 8] has addressed Byzantine vector consensus in
systems that can be modeled by a complete graph. This paper considers Byzantine
vector consensus in incomplete graphs. In particular, we address a particular
class of iterative algorithms in incomplete graphs, and prove a necessary
condition, and a sufficient condition, for the graphs to be able to solve the
vector consensus problem iteratively. We present an iterative Byzantine vector
consensus algorithm, and prove it correct under the sufficient condition. The
necessary condition presented in this paper for vector consensus does not match
with the sufficient condition for d > 1; thus, a weaker condition may
potentially suffice for Byzantine vector consensus.

  Turbulence",,,,,"physics.ao-ph physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Site-specific flow and turbulence information are needed for various
practical applications, ranging from aerodynamic/aeroelastic modeling for wind
turbine design to optical diffraction calculations. Even though highly
desirable, collecting on-site meteorological measurements can be an expensive,
time-consuming, and sometimes a challenging task. In this work, we propose a
coupled mesoscale-large-eddy modeling framework to synthetically generate
site-specific flow and turbulence data. The workhorses behind our framework are
a state-of-the-art, open-source atmospheric model called the Weather Research
and Forecasting (WRF) model and a tuning-free large-eddy simulation (LES)
model.
  Using this coupled framework, we simulate a nighttime stable boundary layer
(SBL) case from the well-known CASES-99 field campaign. One of the unique
aspects of this work is the usage of a diverse range of observations for
characterization and validation. The coupled models reproduce certain
characteristics of observed low-level jets. They also capture various scaling
regimes of energy spectra, including the so-called spectral gap. However, the
coupled models are unable to capture the intermittent nature of the observed
surface fluxes. Lastly, we document and discuss: (i) the tremendous
spatio-temporal variabilities of observed and modeled SBL flow fields, and (ii)
the significant disagreements among different observational platforms. Based on
these results, we strongly recommend that future SBL modeling studies consider
rigorous validation exercises based on multi-sensor/multi-platform datasets.
  In summary, we believe that the numerical generation of realistic SBL is not
an impossible task. Without any doubt, there remain several computational and
fundamental challenges. The present work should be viewed as a first step to
confront some of these challenges.

due to the large transient heat loads they generate on the divertor surfaces
which could limit the operational time of the device. This paper discusses the
application of resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs) as a mechanism for ELM
control on MAST. Experiments have been performed using an n=3 toroidal mode
number perturbation and measurements of the strike point splitting performed.
The measurements have been made using both infrared and visible imaging to
measure the heat and particle flux to the divertor. The measured profiles have
shown clear splitting in L-mode which compares well with the predication of the
splitting location from modelling including the effect of screening. The
splitting of the strike point has also been studied as a function of time
during the ELM. The splitting varies during the ELM, being the strongest at the
time of the peak heat flux and becoming more filamentary at the end of the ELM
(200 microseconds after the peak midplane D(alpha) emission). Variation in the
splitting profiles has also been seen, with some ELMs showing clear splitting
and others no splitting. A possible explanation of this effect is proposed, and
supported by modelling, which concerns the relative phase between the RMP field
and the ELM filament location.

owing to the dynamical activity of minor bodies. Inner dust populations are,
however, still poorly known because of the high contrast and small angular
separation with respect to their host star. We aim to determine the level of
near-infrared exozodiacal dust emission around a sample of 42 nearby main
sequence stars with spectral types ranging from A to K and to investigate its
correlation with various stellar parameters and with the presence of cold dust
belts. We use high-precision K-band visibilities obtained with the FLUOR
interferometer on the shortest baseline of the CHARA array. The calibrated
visibilities are compared with the expected visibility of the stellar
photosphere to assess whether there is an additional, fully resolved
circumstellar emission. Near-infrared circumstellar emission amounting to about
1% of the stellar flux is detected around 13 of our 42 target stars. Follow-up
observations showed that one of them (eps Cep) is associated with a stellar
companion, while another one was detected around what turned out to be a giant
star (kap CrB). The remaining 11 excesses found around single main sequence
stars are most probably associated with hot circumstellar dust, yielding an
overall occurrence rate of 28+8-6% for our (biased) sample. We show that the
occurrence rate of bright exozodiacal discs correlates with spectral type,
K-band excesses being more frequent around A-type stars. It also correlates
with the presence of detectable far-infrared excess emission in the case of
solar-type stars. This study provides new insight into the phenomenon of bright
exozodiacal discs, showing that hot dust populations are probably linked to
outer dust reservoirs in the case of solar-type stars. For A-type stars, no
clear conclusion can be made regarding the origin of the detected near-infrared
excesses.

correlation between slip and the separation of electrical charges, using an
archetypal granular material: photoelastic polymers. We measure a strong
correlation between material displacement, acoustic emissions, and voltage. We
find that the generation of voltage is associated with surface, rather than
bulk properties of the granular materials. While voltage precursors are only
occasionally observed in this system, there is some asymmetry in the
cross-correlation between the slip and voltage signals that indicates
differences between the pre-slip and post-slip dynamics.

Cen X-4 to be highly variable in all energy bands on timescales from days to
months, with the strongest quiescent variability a factor of 22 drop in the
X-ray count rate in only 4 days. The X-ray, UV and optical (V band) emission
are correlated on timescales down to less than 110 s. The shape of the
correlation is a power law with index gamma about 0.2-0.6. The X-ray spectrum
is well fitted by a hydrogen NS atmosphere (kT=59-80 eV) and a power law (with
spectral index Gamma=1.4-2.0), with the spectral shape remaining constant as
the flux varies. Both components vary in tandem, with each responsible for
about 50% of the total X-ray flux, implying that they are physically linked. We
conclude that the X-rays are likely generated by matter accreting down to the
NS surface. Moreover, based on the short timescale of the correlation, we also
unambiguously demonstrate that the UV emission can not be due to either thermal
emission from the stream impact point, or a standard optically thick,
geometrically thin disc. The spectral energy distribution shows a small UV
emitting region, too hot to arise from the accretion disk, that we identified
as a hot spot on the companion star. Therefore, the UV emission is most likely
produced by reprocessing from the companion star, indeed the vertical size of
the disc is small and can only reprocess a marginal fraction of the X-ray
emission. We also found the accretion disc in quiescence to likely be UV faint,
with a minimal contribution to the whole UV flux.

advisable to recommence monitoring of 85Kr content within Russia.

photon distribution) in a cavity with reflecting walls has been treated by many
authors for over a century. After many contending discussions, a consensus has
emerged that the mass of such a photon distribution is equal to its total
energy divided by the square of the speed of light. Nevertheless, questions
remain unsettled on the interaction of the photons with the walls of the box.
In order to understand some of the details of this interaction, a simple case
of a single photon with an energy $E_\nu = h\,\nu$ bouncing up and down in a
static cavity with perfectly reflecting walls in a constant gravitational field
$\vec{g}$, constant in space and time, is studied and its contribution to the
weight of the box is determined as a temporal average.

uniform circular motion of a toy train (Thomas & Friends, Player World, CCF No.

acceleration about 0.154 m/s2 is obtained, while the second gives 0.350 m/s2 of
average centripetal acceleration by assuming ideal condition, where measured
accelerations in z direction is not interpreted.

""independent"" experiments as claimed; they did not perform control experiments
with normal acetone; and, neither did they monitor for tritium. It their
Letter, the authors (D. Shapira and M. Saltmarsh) failed to disclose that the
data they collected actually confirmed our claims of having observed
statistically significant nuclear emissions in chilled, cavitated deuterated
acetone.

of additive inverse element will not be taken into account. We also consider a
metric defined on this nonstandard vector space. Under these settings, the
conventional intuitive properties for the open and closed balls will not hold
true. Therefore, four kinds of open and closed sets are proposed. Furthermore,
the topologies generated by these different concepts of open and closed sets
are investigated.

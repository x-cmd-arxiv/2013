having two units of leptonic charge, known as bileptons. One of such models is
based on the $SU(3)_c\times SU(3)_L\times U(1)_X$ symmetry group (3-3-1 model,
for short). Our search uses the minimal version of the 3-3-1 model, having
exotic charges for the quarks and new gauge bosons. This model predicts the
existence of bileptons as vector particles having one ($V^{\pm}$) and two
($Y^{\pm\pm}$) units of electric charge.
  We study the signatures for the production of four leptons by considering the
contribution of a pair of bileptons in $p p $ collisions for three energy and
luminosity regimes at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We present invariant
mass and transverse momentum distributions, the total cross section and we
determine the expected number of events for each bilepton type. Finally we
analyze the LHC potential for discovering singly and doubly charged vector
bileptons at 95$%$ C.L.. We conclude that the LHC collider can show a clear
signature for the existence of bileptons as a signal of new physics.

task in deciphering complex systems. In this context, the property of network
nestedness has aroused a fair amount of interest as regards ecological
networks. Indeed, Bastolla et al. introduced a simple measure of network
nestedness which opened the door to analytical understanding, allowing them to
conclude that biodiversity is strongly enhanced in highly nested mutualistic
networks. Here, we suggest a slightly refined version of such a measure and go
on to study how it is influenced by the most basic structural properties of
networks, such as degree distribution and degree-degree correlations (i.e.
assortativity). We find that heterogeneity in the degree has a very strong
influence on nestedness. Once such an influence has been discounted, we find
that nestedness is strongly correlated with disassortativity and hence, as
random (neutral) networks have been recently found to be naturally
disassortative, they tend to be naturally nested just as the result of chance.

monolithic and cluster models of sunspots, we have simulated the propagation of
an $f$-mode wave packet through two identical small magnetic flux tubes (R=200
km), embedded in a stratified atmosphere. We want to study the effect of
separation $d$ and incidence angle $\chi$ on the scattered wave. We have
demonstrated that the horizontal compact pair of tubes ($d/R=2$, $\chi=0$)
oscillate as a single tube when the incident wave is propagating, which gives a
scattered wave amplitude of about twice that from a single tube. The scattered
amplitude decreases with increasing $d$ when $d$ is about $\lambda/2\pi$ where
$\lambda$ is the wavelength of the incident wave packet. In this case the
individual tubes start to oscillate separately in the manner of near-field
scattering. When $d$ is about twice of $\lambda/2\pi$, scattering from
individual tubes reaches the far-field regime, giving rise to coherent
scattering with an amplitude similar to the case of the compact pair of tubes.
For perpendicular incidence ($\chi=\pi/2$), the tubes oscillate simultaneously
with the incident wave packet. Moreover, simulations show that a compact
cluster oscillates almost as a single individual small tube and acts more like
a scattering object, while a loose cluster shows multiple-scattering in the
near-field and the absorption is largest when $d$ within the cluster is about
$\lambda/2\pi$. This is the first step to understand the seismic response of a
bundle of magnetic flux tubes in the context of sunspot and plage
helioseismology.

the $L_2$ norm as the metric for the residual error. However, it is well-known
that least squares (LS) based estimators are highly sensitive to outliers
present in the measurement vector leading to a poor performance when the noise
no longer follows the Gaussian assumption but, instead, is better characterized
by heavier-than-Gaussian tailed distributions. In this paper, we propose a
robust iterative hard Thresholding (IHT) algorithm for reconstructing sparse
signals in the presence of impulsive noise. To address this problem, we use a
Lorentzian cost function instead of the $L_2$ cost function employed by the
traditional IHT algorithm. We also modify the algorithm to incorporate prior
signal information in the recovery process. Specifically, we study the case of
CS with partially known support. The proposed algorithm is a fast method with
computational load comparable to the LS based IHT, whilst having the advantage
of robustness against heavy-tailed impulsive noise. Sufficient conditions for
stability are studied and a reconstruction error bound is derived. We also
derive sufficient conditions for stable sparse signal recovery with partially
known support. Theoretical analysis shows that including prior support
information relaxes the conditions for successful reconstruction. Simulation
results demonstrate that the Lorentzian-based IHT algorithm significantly
outperform commonly employed sparse reconstruction techniques in impulsive
environments, while providing comparable performance in less demanding,
light-tailed environments. Numerical results also demonstrate that the
partially known support inclusion improves the performance of the proposed
algorithm, thereby requiring fewer samples to yield an approximate
reconstruction.

recent experimental observations at LHC show the same jet suppression for these
two probes, which - contrary to pQCD expectations - may suggest similar energy
losses for light quarks and gluons in QCD medium. We here use our recently
developed energy loss formalism in a finite size dynamical QCD medium to
analyze this phenomenon that we denote as the ""heavy flavor puzzle at LHC"". We
show that this puzzle is a consequence of an unusual combination of the
suppression and fragmentation patterns, and in fact does not require invoking
the same energy loss for light partons. Furthermore, we show that this

used to study cellular responses to gradients. Here we use Lattice Boltzmann
methods (LBM) to solve both the Navier-Stokes equation (NSE) for the fluid and
the coupled convection-diffusion equation (CDE) for the compounds that form the
diffusion-based gradient. The design of a microfluidic chamber for
diffusion-based gradients must avoid flow through the cell chamber. This can be
achieved by alternately opening the source and the sink channels. The fast
toggling of microfluidic valves requires switching between different boundary
conditions. We demonstrate that the LBM is a powerful method for handling
complex geometries, high Peclet number conditions, discontinuities in the
boundary conditions, and multiphysics coupling.

planets. Observations are now made with increasing sophistication from both
ground and space-based instruments, and exoplanets are characterized with
increasing precision. There is a class of particularly interesting exoplanets,
falling in the habitable zone, which is defined as the area around a star where
the planet is capable of supporting liquid water on its surface. Theoretical
calculations also suggest that close-in exoplanets are more likely to have
weaker planetary magnetic fields, especially in case of super earths. Such
exoplanets are subjected to a high flux of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) due to
their weak magnetic moments. GCRs are energetic particles of astrophysical
origin, which strike the planetary atmosphere and produce secondary particles,
including muons, which are highly penetrating. Some of these particles reach
the planetary surface and contribute to the radiation dose. Along with the
magnetic field, another factor governing the radiation dose is the depth of the
planetary atmosphere. The higher the depth of the planetary atmosphere, the
lower the flux of secondary particles will be on the surface. If the secondary
particles are energetic enough, and their flux is sufficiently high, the
radiation from muons can also impact the sub-surface regions, such as in the
case of Mars. If the radiation dose is too high, the chances of sustaining a
long-term biosphere on the planet are very low. We explore the dependence of
the GCR induced radiation dose on the strength of the planetary magnetic field
and its atmospheric depth, finding that the latter is the decisive factor for
the protection of a planetary biosphere.

arbitrary time-harmonic wave on an absorbing compressible particle that is
suspended in an inviscid fluid are presented. It is considered that the
particle diameter is much smaller than the incident wavelength, i.e. the
so-called Rayleigh scattering limit. Moreover, the particle absorption assumed
here is due to the attenuation of compressional waves only. Shear waves inside
and outside the particle are neglected, since the inner and outer viscous
boundary layer of the particle are supposed to be much smaller than the
particle radius. The obtained radiation force formulas are used to establish
the trapping conditions of a particle by a single-beam acoustical tweezer based
on a spherically focused ultrasound beam. In this case, it is shown that the
particle absorption has a pivotal role in single-beam trapping at the
transducer focal region. Furthermore, it is found that only the first-order
Bessel vortex beam can generate the radiation torque on a small particle. In
addition, numerical evaluation of the radiation force and torque exerted on a
benzene and an olive oil droplet suspended in water are presented and

introduce three generic types of dynamics generating anomalous diffusion:
L\'evy flights, long-time correlated Gaussian stochastic processes and
time-fractional kinetics. By combining Langevin and kinetic approaches we
calculate the work probability distributions in the simple nonequilibrium
situation of a particle subject to a constant force. This allows us to check
the transient FR for anomalous dynamics. We find a new form of FRs, which is
intimately related to the validity of fluctuation-dissipation relations.
Analogous results are obtained for a particle in a harmonic potential dragged
by a constant force. We argue that these findings are important for
understanding fluctuations in experimentally accessible systems. As an example,
we discuss the anomalous dynamics of biological cell migration both in

charged wall with a neutral semipermeable membrane. The wall consists of
periodic stripes, where the charge density varies in one direction. The
membrane is in a contact with a bulk reservoir of an electrolyte solution and
separated from the wall by a thin film of salt-free liquid. One type of ions
(small counterions) permeates into the gap and gives rise to a
distance-dependent membrane potential, which translates into a repulsive
electrostatic disjoining pressure due to an overlap of counterion clouds in the
gap. To quantify it we use two complementary approaches. First, we propose a
mean-field theory based on a linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation and Fourier
analysis. These calculations allow us to estimate the effect of a heterogeneous
charge pattern at the wall on the induced heterogeneous membrane potential, and
the value of the disjoining pressure as a function of the gap. Second, we
perform Langevin dynamics simulations of the same system with explicit ions.
The results of the two approaches are in good agreement with each other at low
surface charge and small gap, but differ due to nonlinearity at the higher
charge. These results demonstrate that a heterogeneity of the wall charge can
lead to a huge reduction in the electrostatic repulsion, which could
dramatically facilitate a self-assembly in complex synthetic and biological
systems.

$(j,0)\oplus(0,j)$ Lorentz group representations. The construction is based on
an analysis of the covariant properties of the parity operator, which for these
representations transforms as the completely temporal component of a
symmetrical tensor of rank $2j$. The covariant properties of parity involve the
Jordan algebra of anti commutators of the Lorentz group generators which unlike
the Lie algebra is not universal. We make the construction explicit for
$j=1/2,1$ and $3/2$, reproducing well-known results for the $j=1/2$ case. We
provide an algorithm for the corresponding calculations for arbitrary $j$. This
covariant basis provides an inventory of all the possible interaction terms for
gauge and non-gauge theories of fields for these representations. In
particular, it supplies a single second rank antisymmetric structure, which in
the Poincar\'e projector formalism implies a single Pauli term arising from
gauge interactions and a single (free) parameter $g$, the gyromagnetic factor.
This simple structure predicts that for an elementary particle in this
formalism all multipole moments, $Q^{l}_{E}$ and $Q^{l}_{M}$, are dictated by
the complete algebraic structure of the Lorentz generators and the value of
$g$. We explicitly calculate the multipole moments, for arbitrary $j$ up to
$l=8$. Comparing with results in the literature we find that only the electric
charge and magnetic moment of a spin $j$ particle are independent of the
Lorentz representation under which it transforms, all higher multipoles being
representation dependent. Finally we show that the propagation of the
corresponding spin $j$ waves in a electromagnetic background is causal.

particle physics. This Letter reports the results from Phase I of the GERmanium
Detector Array (GERDA) experiment at the Gran Sasso Laboratory (Italy)
searching for neutrinoless double beta decay of the isotope 76Ge. Data
considered in the present analysis have been collected between November 2011
and May 2013 with a total exposure of 21.6 kgyr. A blind analysis is performed.
The background index is about 1.10^{-2} cts/(keV kg yr) after pulse shape
discrimination. No signal is observed and a lower limit is derived for the
half-life of neutrinoless double beta decay of 76Ge, T_1/2 > 2.1 10^{25} yr
(90% C.L.). The combination with the results from the previous experiments with
76Ge yields T_1/2 > 3.0 10^{25} yr (90% C.L.).

magnetic susceptibility chi(T) data fit well with the Curie-Weiss formula in
the temperature range of 80-300K and it yields a Curie constant
C=0.39cm3K/mole-V4+ and an antiferromagnetic Weiss temperature theta=-26K. The
chi(T) curve shows a broad maximum at T~25K indicative of short-range order
(SRO) and an anomaly corresponding to long-range order (LRO) at TN~6K. The
value of the frustration index (f=mod[theta/TN]~5) suggests that the system is
moderately frustrated. Above the LRO temperature the experimental magnetic
susceptibility data match well with the coupled Majumdar-Ghosh chain model with
the ratio of the nnn (next-nearest neighbor) to nn (nearest neighbor) magnetic
coupling alpha=2 and Jnnn/kB=40K. In a mean-field approach when considering the
inter-chain interactions, we obtain the total inter-chain coupling to be about
16K. The LRO anomaly at TN is also observe in the specific heat Cp(T) data and
is not sensitive to an applied magnetic field up to 90kOe. A 51V NMR signal
corresponding to the non-magnetic vanadium was observed. Anomalies at 6K were
observed in the variation with temperature of the 51V NMR linewidth and in the
spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1, indicating that they are sensitive to the
LRO onset and fluctuations at the magnetic V sites. The existence of two
components (one short and another long) is observed in the spin-spin relaxation
rate 1/T2 data in the vicinity of TN. The shorter component seems to be
intimately connected with the magnetically ordered state. We suggest that both
magnetically ordered and non-long range ordered (non-LRO) regions coexist in
this compound below the long range ordering temperature.

transfers between the CPU and the accelerator. True work-parallelism has been
hard as the Accelerators cannot directly communicate with other CPUs (besides
the host) and Accelerators. In this work, we present a new nested partition
scheme to overcome this problem. By partitioning the work assignment on a given

proper utilization of both the CPU and Accelerator resources. The problem used

development, tissue regeneration and cancer metastasis. While several feedback
loops have been shown to regulate EMT, it remains elusive how they coordinately
modulate EMT response to TGF-\beta treatment. We construct a mathematical model
for the core regulatory network controlling TGF-\beta-induced EMT. Through
deterministic analyses and stochastic simulations, we show that EMT is a
sequential two-step program that an epithelial cell first transits to partial
EMT then to the mesenchymal state, depending on the strength and duration of
TGF-\beta stimulation. Mechanistically the system is governed by coupled
reversible and irreversible bistable switches. The SNAIL1/miR-34 double
negative feedback loop is responsible for the reversible switch and regulates
the initiation of EMT, while the ZEB/miR-200 feedback loop is accountable for
the irreversible switch and controls the establishment of the mesenchymal
state. Furthermore, an autocrine TGF-\beta/miR-200 feedback loop makes the
second switch irreversible, modulating the maintenance of EMT. Such coupled
bistable switches are robust to parameter variation and molecular noise. We
provide a mechanistic explanation on multiple experimental observations. The
model makes several explicit predictions on hysteretic dynamic behaviors,
system response to pulsed stimulation and various perturbations, which can be
straightforwardly tested.

when complete channel state information is available at the cloud, rates close
to those achievable with total interference cancellation can be achieved. With
mean capacity gains, of up to 2 fold over the conventional cellular network in
both uplink and downlink, this precoding scheme shows great promise for
implementation in a cloud radio network. To simplify the analysis, we use a
stochastic geometric framework based of Poisson point processes instead of the
traditional grid based cellular network model.
  We also study the impact of limiting the channel state information and
geographical clustering to limit the cloud size on the achievable rate. We have
observed that using this zero forcing-dirty paper coding technique, the adverse
effect of inter-cluster interference can be minimized thereby transforming an
interference limited network into a noise limited network as experienced by an
average user in the network for low operating signal-to-noise-ratios. However,
for higher signal-to-noise-ratios, both the average achievable rate and
cell-edge achievable rate saturate as observed in literature. As the
implementation of dirty paper coding is practically not feasible, we present a
practical design of a cloud radio network using cloud a minimum mean square
equalizer for processing the uplink streams and use Tomlinson-Harashima

about the number and forms of counter terms required gets erased. This is to be
compared with what happens in spontaneous symmetry breaking where the use of

reduction of dimensionality of electronic bands and decreases the electronic
density of states at the Fermi level that identifies Y_3Co as a system with the

BZ model using general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of
magnetized jets from accreting (h/r ~ 0.3), spinning (0 < a_* < 0.98) black
holes. We have three main results. First, we quantify the discrepancies between
the BZ jet power and our simulations: assuming maximum efficiency and uniform
fields on the horizon leads to a ~10% overestimate of jet power, while ignoring
the accretion disk leads to a further ~50% overestimate. Simply reducing the
standard BZ jet power prediction by 60% gives a good fit to our simulation
data. Our second result is to show that the membrane formulation of the BZ
model correctly describes the physics underlying simulated jets: torques,
dissipation, and electromagnetic fields on the horizon. This provides intuitive
yet rigorous pictures for the black hole energy extraction process. Third, we
compute the effective resistance of the load region and show that the load and
the black hole achieve near perfect impedance matching. Taken together, these
results increase our confidence in the BZ model as the correct description of
jets observed from astrophysical black holes.

particles unless the overall shock Mach number exceeds a critical value M >
sqrt(5). The reason is that for M <= sqrt(5) the work done to compress the flow
in a particle precursor requires more enthalpy flux than the system can
sustain. This lower limit applies to situations without significant magnetic
field pressure. In case that the magnetic field pressure dominates the pressure
in the unshocked medium, i.e. for low plasma beta, the resistivity of the
magnetic field makes it even more difficult to fulfil the energetic
requirements for the formation of shock with an accelerated particle precursor
and associated compression of the upstream plasma. We illustrate the effects of
magnetic fields for the extreme situation of a purely perpendicular magnetic
field configuration with plasma beta = 0, which gives a minimum Mach number of
M = 5/2. The situation becomes more complex, if we incorporate the effects of
pre-existing cosmic rays, indicating that the additional degree of freedom
allows for less strict Mach number limits on acceleration. We discuss the
implications of this result for low Mach number shock acceleration as found in
solar system shocks, and shocks in clusters of galaxies.

not consistent with a general triggered scenario for the star formation in this

governed by the influence of its OB star population. It suggests that the
simple morphological appearance of an active region is not sufficient to
conclude much about the triggering role in the star formation process. Our

proven efficient, and studies of other regions of the galactic plane would

of first generation stars in that cluster. By exclusion, the fraction of second
generation stars is derived. We assembled a dataset of 1891 field stars of the
thin disk, thick disk, and halo of the Milky Way in the metallicity range -3.15
<= [Fe/H] <= +0.48 dex and with Na abundance from high resolution spectra. They
are mostly dwarfs, but include also giants. Considering only the range in
metallicity spanned by most GCs extensively studied for the Na-O

sample is homogeneized by offsets in [Fe/H] and [Na/H] with respect to a
reference sample using the same line list and NLTE correction for Na adopted in

analyses due to different temperature scales, line lists, adopted (or
neglected) corrections for departures from LTE. We illustrate our method

study the dependence of the slope of the total mass density profile \gamma'

two parameters are sufficent to determine \gamma' with less than 6% residual
scatter. At fixed redshift, \gamma' depends solely on the surface stellar mass
density \partial \gamma'/ \partial \Sigma_*=0.38\pm 0.07, i.e. galaxies with
denser stars also have steeper slopes. At fixed M_* and R_{eff}, \gamma'
depends on redshift, in the sense that galaxies at a lower redshift have
steeper slopes (\partial \gamma' / \partial z = -0.31\pm 0.10). However, the
mean redshift evolution of \gamma' for an individual galaxy is consistent with
zero d\gamma'/dz=-0.10\pm0.12. This result is obtained by combining our

and characterized for possible habitability. Like the host-planets to their
host-star, exomoons have a limiting radius at which they may be gravitationally
bound, or the Hill radius. In addition, they also have a distance at which they
will become tidally locked and therefore in synchronous rotation with the
planet. We have examined the flux phase profile of a simulated, hypothetical
moon orbiting at a distant radius around the confirmed exoplanets mu Ara b, HD
28185 b, BD +14 4559 b, and HD 73534 b. The irradiated flux on a moon at it's
furthest, stable distance from the planet achieves it's largest flux gradient,
which places a limit on the flux ranges expected for subsequent (observed)
moons closer in orbit to the planet. We have also analyzed the effect of
planetary eccentricity on the flux on the moon, examining planets that traverse
the habitable zone either fully or partially during their orbit. Looking solely
at the stellar contributions, we find that moons around planets that are
totally within the habitable zone experience thermal equilibrium temperatures
above the runaway greenhouse limit, requiring a small heat redistribution
efficiency. In contrast, exomoons orbiting planets that only spend a fraction
of their time within the habitable zone require a heat redistribution
efficiency near 100% in order to achieve temperatures suitable for
habitability.
  Meaning, a planet does not need to spend its entire orbit within the
habitable zone in order for the exomoon to be habitable. Because the applied
systems are comprised of giant planets around bright stars, we believe that the

produce unique orbital properties. For example, two-planet systems that lie
near the boundary between circulation and libration of their periapses could
result if planet-planet scattering ejected a former third planet quickly,
leaving one planet on an eccentric orbit and the other on a circular orbit. We
first improve upon previous work that examined the apsidal behavior of known
multiplanet systems by doubling the sample size and including observational
uncertainties. This analysis recovers previous results that demonstrated that
many systems lay on the apsidal boundary between libration and circulation. We
then performed over 12,000 three-dimensional N-body simulations of hypothetical
three-body systems that are unstable, but stabilize to two-body systems after
an ejection. Using these synthetic two-planet systems, we test the
planet-planet scattering hypothesis by comparing their apsidal behavior, over a
range of viewing angles, to that of the observed systems and find that they are
statistically consistent regardless of the multiplicity of the observed
systems. Finally, we combine our results with previous studies to show that,
from the sampled cases, the most likely planetary mass function prior to
planet-planet scattering follows a power law with index -1.1. We find that this
pre-scattering mass function predicts a mutual inclination frequency
distribution that follows an exponential function with an index between -0.06

putative progenitor systems in which we accreted material from asymptotic giant

and gravitational settling. While we are able to find a reasonable fit to the
carbon and sodium abundances of SDSS J1707+58, suggesting accretion of around
0.1 solar masses from a 2 solar mass companion, the strontium and barium

other than a standard $s$ process. We have more success in fitting the

just 1.6 Gyr after the Big Bang. The SMGs GN20.2a and GN20.2b have deconvolved

CO emission from the 14 known B-band Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) in the field,
tentatively detecting CO in a previously-undetected LBG and placing 3sigma

measure surface photometry, and estimate stellar masses of the deflector
early-type galaxies. Lens modeling is performed on the HST images (or CFHT when
HST is not available) by fitting the spatially extended light distribution of
the lensed features assuming a singular isothermal ellipsoid mass profile and
by reconstructing the intrinsic source light distribution on a pixelized grid.
Based on the analysis of systematic uncertainties and comparison with inference
based on different methods we estimate that our Einstein Radii are accurate to
\sim3%. HST imaging provides a much higher success rate in confirming
gravitational lenses and measuring their Einstein radii than CFHT imaging does.
Lens modeling with ground-based images however, when successful, yields
Einstein radius measurements that are competitive with spaced-based images.
Information from the lens models is used together with spectroscopic
information from the companion paper IV to classify the systems, resulting in a
final sample of 39 confirmed (grade-A) lenses and 17 promising candidates. The
redshifts of the main deflector span a range 0.3<zd< 0.8, providing an

modification known to eliminate the unphysical O poisoned phase. The impurities
can adsorb and desorb on the surface, but otherwise remain inert. In a previous
work that did not include CO desorption [G. M. Buendia and P. A. Rikvold, Phys.
Rev. E, 85 031143 (2012)], we found that the impurities have very distinctive
effects on the phase diagram and greatly diminish the reactivity of the system.
If the impurities do not desorb, once the system reaches a stationary state,
the CO_2 production disappears. When the impurities are allowed to desorb,
there are regions where the CO_2 reaction window reappears, although greatly
reduced. Following experimental evidence that indicates that temperature
effects are crucial in many catalytic processes, here we further analyze these
effects by including a CO desorption rate. We find that the CO desorption has
the effect to smooth the transition between the reactive and the CO rich phase,
and most importantly it can counteract the negative effects of the presence of
impurities by widening the reactive window such that now the system remains
catalytically active in the whole range of CO pressures.

the dependence of the wave function on the interelectronic distance rij is
built via the correlation factor f(rij). While the short-distance behavior of
this factor is well understood, little is known about the form of f(rij) at
large rij. In this work we investigate the optimal form of f(r12) on the
example of the helium atom and helium-like ions and several well-motivated
models of the wave function. Using the Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle we
derive a differential equation for f(r12) and solve it using numerical
propagation or analytic asymptotic expansion techniques. We found that for
every model under consideration, f(r12) behaves at large r12 as r12^{\rho}
exp(B r12) and obtained simple analytic expressions for the system dependent
values of {\rho} and B. For the ground state of the helium-like ions the value
of B is positive, so that f(r12) diverges as r12 tends to infinity. The
numerical propagation confirms this result. When the Hartree-Fock orbitals,
multiplied by the correlation factor, are expanded in terms of Slater functions
r^n exp(-{\beta}r), the numerical propagation reveals a minimum in f(r12) with
depth increasing with N. For the lowest triplet state B is negative. Employing
our analytical findings, we propose a new 'range-separated' form of the
correlation factor with the short- and long-range r12 regimes approximated by
appropriate asymptotic formulas connected by a switching function. Exemplary
calculations show that this new form of f(r12) performs somewhat better than
the correlation factors used thus far in the standard R12 or F12 theories.

the final stage of the collapse, just before the divergence of the central
density, we show that the existence of a self-similar collapsing solution
compatible with the numerical observations imposes that the gravity forces are
stronger than the pressure ones. This situation differs drastically in its
principle from the one generally admitted where pressure and gravity forces are
assumed to be of the same order. Our new self-similar solution (based on the
hypothesis of dominant gravity forces) which matches the smooth solution of the
outer core solution, agrees globally well with our numerical results. Whereas
some differences with the earlier self-similar solutions are minor, others are
very important. For example, we find that the velocity field becomes singular
at the collapse time, diverging at the center, and decreasing slowly outside
the core, whereas previous works described a finite velocity field in the core
which tends to a supersonic constant value at large distances. This discrepancy
should be important for explaining the emission of remnants in the
post-collapse regime. Finally we describe the post-collapse dynamics, when mass
begins to accumulate in the center, also within the hypothesis that gravity

this is that quantizing at the noise level suffices to achieve the cut-set
bound approximately to within an additive gap, without any requirement of
instantaneous channel state information (CSI). However, DMT only captures the
high SNR performance and potentially, limited CSI at the relay can improve
performance at moderate SNRs. In this work we propose an optimization framework

synchronization and the information flow in dynamical systems possessing
homogeneous or heterogeneous global interactions whose origin can be external

of coupled chaotic maps for such systems, we show that the presence of a
homogeneous global field, either external or internal, for all times is not
indispensable for achieving complete or generalized synchronization in a system
of chaotic elements. Complete synchronization can also appear with
heterogeneous global fields; it does not requires the simultaneous sharing of
the field by all the elements in a system. We use the normalized mutual
information and the information transfer between global and local variables to
characterize complete and generalized synchronization. We show that these
information measures can characterize both types of synchronized states and
also allow to discern the origin of a global interaction field. A
synchronization state emerges when a sufficient amount of information provided
by a field is shared by all the elements in the system, on the average over
long times. Thus, the maximum value of the top-down information transfer can be
used as a predictor of synchronization in a system, as a parameter is varied.

understand the observations of exoplanets. We clarify that the theoretically
predicted type II migration is too fast, as well as type I migration, by
developing detailed analytical arguments in which the timescale of type II
migration is compared with the disk lifetime. In the disk-dominated regime, the
type II migration timescale is characterized by a {\it local} viscous diffusion
timescale, while the disk lifetime characterized by a {\it global} diffusion
timescale that is much longer than the local one. Even in the planet-dominated
regime where the inertia of the planet mass reduces the migration speed, the
timescale is still shorter than the disk lifetime except in the final disk
evolution stage where the total disk mass decays below the planet mass. This
suggests that most giant planets plunge into the central stars within the disk
lifetime, and it contradicts the exoplanet observations that gas giants are
piled up at $r \ga 1$AU. We examine additional processes that may arise in
protoplanetary disks: dead zones, photoevaporation of gas, and gas flow across
a gap formed by a type II migrator. Although they make the type II migration
timescale closer to the disk lifetime, we show that none of them can act as an
effective barrier for rapid type II migration with the current knowledge of
these processes. We point out that gas flow across a gap and the fraction of
the flow accreted onto the planets are uncertain and they may have a potential
to solve the problem. Much more detailed investigation for each process may be
needed to explain the observed distribution of gas giants in extrasolar

possess an event horizon and their global spacetime structure is different from

gravitational-wave emission, which can be used as a discriminant between black

SNRs. In this paper, a unified performance metric, which we shall refer to as
the outage exponent, will be proposed. Our approach is mainly based on the
large deviations theory and the Meijer's G-function. It is shown that the
proposed outage exponent is not only an accurate estimation of the outage
probability for any number of subchannels, any SNR, and any target transmission
rate, but also provides an easy way to compute the outage capacity, finite-SNR
diversity-multiplexing tradeoff, and SNR gain. The asymptotic performance
metrics, such as the delay-limited capacity, ergodic capacity, and
diversity-multiplexing tradeoff can be directly obtained by letting the number
of subchannels or SNR tends to infinity. Similar to Gallager's error exponent,
a reliable function for parallel fading channels, which illustrates a
fundamental relationship between the transmission reliability and efficiency,
can also be defined from the outage exponent. Therefore, the proposed outage
exponent provides a complete and comprehensive performance measure for parallel
fading channels.

extensively, and many theoretical and practical solutions to query processing
have been proposed under various scenarios. With the recent popularity of cloud
computing, users now have the opportunity to outsource their data as well as
the data management tasks to the cloud. However, due to the rise of various
privacy issues, sensitive data (e.g., medical records) need to be encrypted
before outsourcing to the cloud. In addition, query processing tasks should be
handled by the cloud; otherwise, there would be no point to outsource the data
at the first place. To process queries over encrypted data without the cloud
ever decrypting the data is a very challenging task. In this paper, we focus on
solving the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) query problem over encrypted database
outsourced to a cloud: a user issues an encrypted query record to the cloud,
and the cloud returns the k closest records to the user. We first present a
basic scheme and demonstrate that such a naive solution is not secure. To
provide better security, we propose a secure kNN protocol that protects the
confidentiality of the data, user's input query, and data access patterns.
Also, we empirically analyze the efficiency of our protocols through various
experiments. These results indicate that our secure protocol is very efficient
on the user end, and this lightweight scheme allows a user to use any mobile
device to perform the kNN query.

The large sample size and survey area reduce the LF uncertainties due to
Poisson statistics and cosmic variance by >3 compared to previous studies. At
the bright end, the LF shows excess power compared to the best-fit Schechter
function, which can be attributed to the contribution of $z\sim3$ quasars. We
compute the rest-frame near-infrared LF and stellar mass function (SMF) of z~3
LBGs based on the R-band and IRAC [4.5 micro m]-band flux relation. We
investigate the evolution of the UV LFs and SMFs between z~7 and z~3, which
supports a rising star formation history in the LBGs. We study the spatial
correlation function of two bright LBG samples and estimate their average host
halo mass. We find a tight relation between the host halo mass and the galaxy
star formation rate (SFR),which follows the trend predicted by the baryonic
accretion rate onto the halo, suggesting that the star formation in LBGs is
fueled by baryonic accretion through the cosmic web. By comparing the SFRs with
the total baryonic accretion rates, we find that cosmic star formation
efficiency is about 5%-20% and it does not evolve significantly with redshift,
halo mass, or galaxy luminosity.

both investigate the nature of dark energy and discriminate between General
Relativity and modified gravity theories. In order to successfully achieve
these goals, systematics in shear measurements have to be taken into account;
their impact on the weak lensing power spectrum has to be carefully
investigated in order to estimate the bias induced on the inferred cosmological
parameters. To this end, we develop here an efficient tool to compute the power
spectrum of systematics by propagating, in a realistic way, shear measurement,
source properties and survey setup uncertainties. Starting from analytical
results for unweighted moments and general assumptions on the relation between
measured and actual shear, we derive analytical expressions for the
multiplicative and additive bias, showing how these terms depend not only on
the shape measurement errors, but also on the properties of the source galaxies
(namely, size, magnitude and spectral energy distribution). We are then able to
compute the amplitude of the systematics power spectrum and its scaling with
redshift, while we propose a multigaussian expansion to model in a
non-parametric way its angular scale dependence. Our method allows to
self-consistently propagate the systematics uncertainties to the finally
observed shear power spectrum, thus allowing us to quantify the departures from
the actual spectrum. We show that even a modest level of systematics can induce
non-negligible deviations, thus leading to a significant bias on the recovered
cosmological parameters.

try to reproduce the observations of both the solar system, and the extrasolar
planets. Some of these models have partially succeeded, focussing however on
massive planets, and for the sake of simplicity excluding planets belonging to
planetary systems. However, more and more planets are now found in planetary
systems. This tendency, which is a result of both radial velocity, transit and
direct imaging surveys, seems to be even more pronounced for low mass planets.
These new observations require the improvement of planet formation models,
including new physics, and considering the formation of systems. In a recent
series of papers, we have presented some improvements in the physics of our
models, focussing in particular on the internal structure of forming planets,
and on the computation of the excitation state of planetesimals, and their
resulting accretion rate. In this paper, we focus on the concurrent effect of
the formation of more than one planet in the same protoplanetary disc, and show
the effect, in terms of global architecture and composition of this
multiplicity. We use a N-body calculation including collision detection to
compute the orbital evolution of a planetary system. Moreover, we describe the
effect of competition for accretion of gas and solids, as well as the effect of
gravitational interactions between planets. We show that the masses and
semi-major axis of planets are modified by both the effect of competition and
gravitational interactions. We also present the effect of the assumed number of
forming planets in the same system (a free parameter of the model), as well as
the effect of the inclination and eccentricity damping.

instruments onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The flare occurs in a
complex active region with multiple polarities. The Extreme-Ultraviolet (EUV)
Variability Experiment (EVE) observations in the warm coronal emission reveal
three enhancements, of which the third one corresponds to an EUV late phase.
The three enhancements have a one-to-one correspondence to the three stages in
flare evolution identified by the spatially-resolved Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly (AIA) observations, which are characterized by a flux rope eruption, a
moderate filament ejection, and the appearance of EUV late phase loops,
respectively. The EUV late phase loops are spatially and morphologically
distinct from the main flare loops. Multi-channel analysis suggests the
presence of a continuous but fragmented energy injection during the EUV late
phase resulting in the warm corona nature of the late phase loops. Based on
these observational facts, We propose a three-stage magnetic reconnection
scenario to explain the flare evolution. Reconnections in different stages
involve different magnetic fields but show a casual relationship between them.
The EUV late phase loops are mainly produced by the least energetic magnetic
reconnection in the last stage.

array of four imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes located in Namibia, are
described here. The HGPS aims at the detection of cosmic accelerators with
environments suitable for the production of photons at the highest energies and
has led to the discovery of an unexpectedly large and diverse population of
over 60 sources of TeV gamma rays within its current range of l = 250 to 65
degrees in longitude and |b|<3.5 degrees in latitude. The data set of the HGPS
comprises 2800 hours of high-quality data, taken in the years 2004 to 2013. The
sensitivity for the detection of point-like sources, assuming a power-law
spectrum with a spectral index of 2.3 at a statistical significance of 5 sigma,
is now at the level of 2% Crab or better in the core HGPS region. The latest
maps of the inner Galaxy at TeV energies are shown alongside an introduction to
the first H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey catalog. Finally, in addition to an
overview of the H.E.S.S. Galactic source population a few remarkable, recently

natural generalization to the usual fractional Sobolev spaces. The thesis

  In the first part, we define the generalized fractional Sobolev spaces and
prove some of their properties including embeddings and interpolation

of H\""older-continuous functions, by showing that a particular kind of space
embeds into the space of continuous functions without any modulus of

  The inverse problem is considered in the second part of the thesis. We prove
a new Carleman estimate for $\partial$. This estimate has a fast decay rate,
which will allow us to consider potentials with very low regularity. After that
we use Bukhgeim's oscillating exponential solutions, Alessandrini's identity

a widely-held scenario in which pairs of planets were captured into first-order

relation Y_b \approx Y_\tau \approx Y_t/6 among the third generation quark and

presence of waves in extragalactic jets. The evidence points towards the peak
of emission in helical jets corresponding to pressure-maxima of a wave that is
generated within the core region and propagates downstream. Making use of a
number of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of the radio
jet in the quasar S5~0836+710 at different frequencies and epochs, Perucho et
al. (2012) were able to observe wave-like behavior within the observed
radio-jet. The ridge-line of the emission in the jet coincides within the
errors at all frequencies. Moreover, small differences between epochs at 15 GHz
reveal wave-like motion of the ridge-line transversal to the jet propagation
axis. The authors conclude that the helicity is a real, physical structure. I
report here on those results and discuss this result in the light of new
results recently announced by other authors that confirm the presence of waves

graph $G$ in a certain class of graphs, perturbing slightly the edges of $G$ at
random (usually adding few random edges to $G$) typically results in a graph
having much ""nicer"" properties. In this work we study smoothed analysis on
trees or, equivalently, on connected graphs. Given an $n$-vertex connected
graph $G$, form a random supergraph $G^*$ of $G$ by turning every pair of
vertices of $G$ into an edge with probability $\frac{\epsilon}{n}$, where
$\epsilon$ is a small positive constant. This perturbation model has been
studied previously in several contexts, including smoothed analysis, small
world networks, and combinatorics.
  Connected graphs can be bad expanders, can have very large diameter, and
possibly contain no long paths. In contrast, we show that if $G$ is an
$n$-vertex connected graph then typically $G^*$ has edge expansion
$\Omega(\frac{1}{\log n})$, diameter $O(\log n)$, vertex expansion
$\Omega(\frac{1}{\log n})$, and contains a path of length $\Omega(n)$, where
for the last two properties we additionally assume that $G$ has bounded maximum
degree. Moreover, we show that if $G$ has bounded degeneracy, then typically
the mixing time of the lazy random walk on $G^*$ is $O(\log^2 n)$. All these
results are asymptotically tight.

characterized by the dimensionless exponential time rate of growth $2\sigma$

be obtained from a linear objective convex programming. For the asymptotic

third order, the optimal control problem reduces to linear programming with the
primary component of the third order correlations or a related integral
quantity as the control variable; the supports of the second and third order

of feasible solutions is demonstrated when the related quantity is the control

on the time scales and amplitudes of the variability with respect to the
different filters and stellar parameters as calculated from published
Str\""omgren and Geneva photometry. We identified 32 variable stars in the field
of the cluster out of which 21 are confirmed members and twelve are newly
detected variable stars. Ten stars were classified as Slowly Pulsating B (SPB)
stars in NGC 6231 out of which seven are new discoveries. We also analyzed six
previously reported {\beta} Cephei variables in more detail. One of them may be
a hybrid {\beta} Cephei/SPB pulsator. In addition, we investigated five more
previously suspected pulsators of this group which we cannot convincingly
confirm. The remaining eleven variable stars are either not members of NGC 6231
or the membership status is questionable. Among them are three previously known
{\delta} Scuti stars, two newly detected pulsators of this class, one new and
two already known eclipsing binaries, one new SPB variable, one possible
Pre-Main-Sequence (PMS) pulsator and another new variable star for which we

provides a dynamically generated infra-red wall in the computation of mesonic
bound state masses and decay constants. As an example, we use the model, with
perturbative computations of the running of gamma, to study SU(3) gauge theory
with a continuous number of quark flavours, Nf. We follow the behaviour of the
spectrum as we approach the conformal window through a walking gauge theory
regime. We show such walking theories display a BKT phase transition, with
Miransky scaling, as one approaches the edge of the conformal window at the
critical value of Nf. We show that these walking theories possess an enhanced
quark condensate, a light Higgs like excitation and argue that the
non-perturbative contribution to S falls to zero. We also study the deformation
of the BKT transition when the quarks have a current mass which may be of use
for understanding lattice simulations of walking theories.

restriction we study is: they can be computed by bounded fanin circuits of
constant depth (NC^0), or of O(log log n) depth but with O(1) alternations
(polylog AC^0). Each output bit depends on very few input bits; thus such proof
systems correspond to a kind of local error-correction on a theorem-proof pair.
  We identify exactly how much power we need for proof systems to capture all
regular languages. We show that all regular language have polylog AC^0 proof
systems, and from a previous result (Beyersdorff et al, MFCS 2011, where NC^0
proof systems were first introduced), this is tight. Our technique also shows
that MAJ has polylog AC^0 proof system. We explore the question of whether TAUT
has NC^0 proof systems. Addressing this question about 2TAUT, and since 2TAUT
is closely related to reachability in graphs, we ask the same question about
Reachability. We show that both Undirected Reachability and Directed
UnReachability have NC^0 proof systems, but Directed Reachability is still
open.
  In the context of how much power is needed for proof systems for languages in
NP, we observe that proof systems for a good fraction of languages in NP do not
need the full power of AC^0; they have SAC^0 or coSAC^0 proof systems.

primordial objects in the local Universe. Our objective is to characterize the
HI content of the XMP galaxies as a class, using as a reference the list of 140
known local XMPs compiled by Morales-Luis et al. (2011). We have observed 29
XMPs, which had not been observed before at 21 cm, using the Effelsberg radio
telescope. This information was complemented with HI data published in
literature for a further 53 XMPs. In addition, optical data from the literature
provided morphologies, stellar masses, star-formation rates and metallicities.
Effelsberg HI integrated flux densities are between 1 and 15 Jy km/s, while
line widths are between 20 and 120 km/s. HI integrated flux densities and line
widths from literature are in the range 0.1 - 200 Jy km/s and 15 - 150 km/s,
respectively. Of the 10 new Effelsberg detections, two sources show an
asymmetric double-horn profile, while the remaining sources show either
asymmetric (7 sources) or symmetric (1 source) single-peak 21 cm line profiles.
An asymmetry in the HI line profile is systematically accompanied by an
asymmetry in the optical morphology. Typically, the g-band stellar
mass-to-light ratios are ~0.1, whereas the HI gas mass-to-light ratios may be
up to 2 orders of magnitude larger. Moreover, HI gas-to-stellar mass ratios
fall typically between 10 and 20, denoting that XMPs are extremely gas-rich. We
find an anti-correlation between the HI gas mass-to-light ratio and the
luminosity, whereby fainter XMPs are more gas-rich than brighter XMPs,
suggesting that brighter sources have converted a larger fraction of their HI
gas into stars. The dynamical masses inferred from the HI line widths imply
that the stellar mass does not exceed 5% of the dynamical mass, while the
\ion{H}{i} mass constitutes between 20 and 60% of the dynamical mass.

parametrically to a mass M ~ pi T, generalizing thereby previous NLO results
which only apply in the non-relativistic regime M >> pi T. The non-relativistic
expansion is observed to converge for M > 15 T, but the smallness of any loop
corrections allows it to be used in practice already for M > 4 T. In the latter
regime any non-covariant dependence of the differential rate on the spatial

ultrarelativistic regime M << pi T, but after a simple mass resummation it
nevertheless extrapolates reasonably well towards a result obtained previously
through complete LPM resummation, apparently confirming a strong enhancement of
the rate at high temperatures (which facilitates chemical equilibration). When

isotope ratios in meteoritic material. Predictions of 146Sm and 144Sm
production in the gamma-process in massive stars are at odds with these
constraints and this is partly due to deficiences in the prediction of the
reaction rates involved. The production ratio depends almost exclusively on the
(gamma,n)/(gamma,alpha) branching at 148Gd. A measurement of
144Sm(alpha,gamma)148Gd at low energy had discovered considerable discrepancies
between cross section predictions and the data. Although this reaction cross
section mainly depends on the optical alpha+nucleus potential, no global
optical potential has yet been found which can consistently describe the
results of this and similar alpha-induced reactions at the low energies
encountered in astrophysical environments. The untypically large deviation in
144Sm(alpha,gamma) and the unusual energy dependence can be explained, however,
by low-energy Coulomb excitation which is competing with compound nucleus
formation at very low energies. Considering this additional reaction channel,
the cross sections can be described with the usual optical potential
variations, compatible with findings for (n,alpha) reactions in this mass
range. Low-energy (alpha,gamma) and (alpha,n) data on other nuclei can also be
consistently explained in this way. Since Coulomb excitation does not affect
alpha-emission, the 148Gd(gamma,alpha) rate is much higher than previously
assumed. This leads to small 146Sm/144Sm stellar production ratios, in even
more pronounced conflict with the meteorite data.

energy of the largest superflare on this star is ~10^3 times larger (~2.2*10^35
erg) than that of the most energetic flare on the Sun (~10^32 erg). The core
depth and emission flux of Ca II infrared triplet lines and Ha line show high
chromospheric activity in this star, in spite of its low lithium abundance and
the small amplitude of the rotational modulation. Using the empirical relations
between emission flux of chromospheric lines and X-ray flux, this star is
considered to show much higher coronal activity than that of the Sun. It
probably has large starspots which can store a large amount of magnetic energy
enough to give rise to superflares. We also estimated the stellar parameters,
such as effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, projected
rotational velocity (v sin_i), and radial velocity. KIC6934317 is then
confirmed to be an early G-type main sequence star. The value of v sin_i is
estimated to be ~1.91 km s^-1. In contrast, the rotational velocity is
calculated to be ~20 km s^-1 by using the period of the brightness variation as
the rotation period. This difference can be explained by its small inclination
angle (nearly pole-on). The small inclination angle is also supported by the
contrast between the large superflare amplitude and the small stellar
brightness variation amplitude. The lithium abundance and isochrones implies
that the age of this star is more than about a few Gyr, though a problem why
this star with such an age has a strong activity remains unsolved.

To investigate the first stages of the process of high-mass
star formation, we selected a sample of massive clumps previously observed with
the SEST at 1.2 mm and with the ATNF ATCA at 1.3 cm. We want to characterize
the physical conditions in such sources, and test whether their properties
depend on the evolutionary stage of the clump.
  Methods. With ATCA we observed the selected sources in the NH3(1,1) and (2,2)
transitions and in the 22 GHz H2O maser line. Ammonia lines are a good
temperature probe that allow us to accurately determine the mass and the
column-, volume-, and surface densities of the clumps. We also collected all
data available to construct the spectral energy distribution of the individual
clumps and to determine if star formation is already occurring, through
observations of its most common signposts, thus putting constraints on the
evolutionary stage of the source. We fitted the spectral energy distribution
between 1.2 mm and 70 microns with a modified black body to derive the dust
temperature and independently determine the mass.
  Results. The clumps are cold (T~10-30 K), massive (M~10^2-10^3 Mo), and dense
(n(H2)>~10^5 cm^-3) and they have high column densities (N(H2)~10^23 cm^-2).
All clumps appear to be potentially able to form high-mass stars. The most
massive clumps appear to be gravitationally unstable, if the only sources of
support against collapse are turbulence and thermal pressure, which possibly
indicates that the magnetic field is important in stabilizing them.
  Conclusions. After investigating how the average properties depend on the
evolutionary phase of the source, we find that the temperature and central
density progressively increase with time. Sources likely hosting a ZAMS star
show a steeper radial dependence of the volume density and tend to be more
compact than starless clumps.

Restricting ZZ invariant masses to $M_{ZZ} \ge 300$ GeV range, we estimate that
this bound can be improved to $\Gamma_H \le 21 \times \Gamma_H^{SM} \approx 88$

Model particles scale in a universal way, our result can be translated into an
upper limit on the branching fraction of the Higgs boson decay to invisible
final states. We obtain $Br(H \to inv) < 0.84 (0.78)$, depending on the range
of ZZ invariant masses that are used to constrain the width. We believe that an
analysis along these lines should be performed by experimental collaborations

- and thereby induce thermalization of the single-particle current. In
addition, we include also weak localization effects and determine the coherent
corrections to the incoherent transport in terms of the coherent backscattering
signal. We find that inelastic collisions lead to an enhancement of the
backscattered cone in a narrow spectral window for increasing interaction
strength.

a candidate for explaining the spontaneous formation of magnetic flux

Much of this work has been done for isothermal layers for which the density
scale height is constant throughout. We now study the validity of earlier
conclusions about the size and growth rate of magnetic structures in the case
of polytropic layers, which scale height decreases sharply towards the surface.
To allow for a continuous transition from isothermal to polytropic layers, we
employ a generalization of the exponential function known as the q-exponential.
Now, the top of the polytropic layer shifts with the polytropic index such that
the scale height at some reference height is always the same. We use both
mean-field and direct numerical simulations of forced stratified turbulence to
determine the resulting flux concentrations. Magnetic structures begin to form
at a depth where magnetic field strength is about 3-4% the local equipartition
field strength with respect to the turbulent kinetic energy. Unlike the
isothermal case where stronger fields can give rise to magnetic flux
concentrations at larger depths, in the polytropic one the growth rates
decreases for structures deeper down. For vertical fields, magnetic structures
of super-equipartition strengths are formed because such fields survive
downward advection, unlike NEMPI under horizontal magnetic fields. The
horizontal cross-section of such structures is approximately circular. Results
based on isothermal models can be applied locally to polytropic layers. For
vertical fields, magnetic flux concentrations of super-equipartition strengths
form, which supports suggestions that sunspot formation might be a shallow
phenomenon.

As a result, the method of second-order cone programming can be used to compute

compute an exact $D$-optimal design, which is possible thanks to high-quality

mutations facilitating the adaptation to novel environments. Experimental
evolution studies have demonstrated that rapid and strong phenotypic responses
to selection can also be obtained in the laboratory. When combined with the
Next Generation Sequencing technology, these experiments promise to identify
the individual loci contributing to adaption. Nevertheless, until now, very
little is known about the design of such evolve and resequencing (E&R) studies.
Here, we use forward simulations of entire genomes to evaluate different
experimental designs that aim to maximize the power to detect selected
variants. We show that low linkage disequilibrium in the starting population,
population size, duration of the experiment and the number of replicates are
the key factors in determining the power and accuracy of E&R studies.
Furthermore, replication of E&R is more important for detecting the targets of
selection than increasing the population size. Using an optimized design
beneficial loci with a selective advantage as low as s=0.005 can be identified
at the nucleotide level. Even when a large number of loci are selected
simultaneously, up to 56% can be reliably detected without incurring large
numbers of false positives. Our computer simulations suggest that, with an
adequate experimental design, E&R studies are a powerful tool to identify
adaptive mutations from standing genetic variation and thereby provide an
excellent means to analyze the trajectories of selected alleles in evolving
populations.

Szemer\'edi theorem, which was the main novel ingredient in the proof of the
celebrated Green-Tao theorem that the primes contain arbitrarily long
arithmetic progressions. Roughly speaking, a relative Szemer\'edi theorem says
that if S is a set of integers satisfying certain conditions, and A is a subset
of S with positive relative density, then A contains long arithmetic
progressions, and our recent results show that S only needs to satisfy a
so-called linear forms condition.
  This note contains an alternative proof of the new relative Szemer\'edi
theorem, where we directly transfer Szemer\'edi's theorem, instead of going
through the hypergraph removal lemma. This approach provides a somewhat more
direct route to establishing the result, and it gives better quantitative
bounds.

model theorem of Green-Tao and Tao-Ziegler (with simplified proofs given later
by Gowers, and independently, Reingold-Trevisan-Tulsiani-Vadhan) applied with a
discrepancy/cut-type norm (instead of a Gowers uniformity norm as it was

and rarefied flows. Many AP schemes have been developed and are capable of
capturing the Euler limit in the continuum regime. However, to get accurate
Navier-Stokes solutions is still challenging for many AP schemes. In order to
distinguish the numerical effects of different AP schemes on the simulation
results in the continuum flow limit, an implicit-explicit (IMEX) AP scheme and
the unified gas kinetic scheme (UGKS) based on Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGk)
kinetic equation will be applied in the flow simulation in both transition and
continuum flow regimes. As a benchmark test case, the lid-driven cavity flow is
used for the comparison of these two AP schemes. The numerical results show
that the UGKS captures the viscous solution accurately. The velocity profiles
are very close to the classical benchmark solutions. However, the IMEX AP
scheme seems have difficulty to get these solutions. Based on the analysis and
the numerical experiments, it is realized that the dissipation of AP schemes in
continuum limit is closely related to the numerical treatment of collision and
transport of the kinetic equation. Numerically it becomes necessary to couple
the convection and collision terms in both flux evaluation at a cell interface
and the collision source term treatment inside each control volume.

for the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is reviewed. Up to 70 SST, with a
primary mirror diameter of 4 m, will be produced and installed at the CTA
southern site. These will allow investigation of the gamma-ray sky at the
highest energies accessible to CTA, in the range from about 1 TeV to 300 TeV.
The telescope presented in this contribution is characterized by two major
innovations: the use of a dual mirror Schwarzschild-Couder configuration and of
an innovative camera using as sensors either multi-anode photomultipliers
(MAPM) or silicon photomultipliers (SiPM). The reduced plate-scale of the
telescope, achieved with the dual-mirror optics, allows the camera to be
compact (40 cm in diameter), and low-cost. The camera, which has about 2000
pixels of size 6x6 mm^2, covers a field of view of 10{\deg}. The dual mirror
telescopes and their cameras are being developed by three consortia, ASTRI
(Astrofisica con Specchi a Tecnologia Replicante Italiana, Italy/INAF), GATE
(Gamma-ray Telescope Elements, France/Paris Observ.) and CHEC (Compact High
Energy Camera, universities in UK, US and Japan) which are merging their
efforts in order to finalize an end-to-end design that will be constructed for
CTA. A number of prototype structures and cameras are being developed in order
to investigate various alternative designs. In this contribution, these designs
are presented, along with the technological solutions under study.

longitudinal momentum fractions that sum to unity. For three particles, this
constraint limits the two remaining independent momentum fractions to a
triangle, for which the three momentum fractions act as barycentric
coordinates. For three identical bosons, the wave function must be symmetric
with respect to all three momentum fractions. Therefore, as a basis, we
construct polynomials in two variables on a triangle that are symmetric with
respect to the interchange of any two barycentric coordinates. We find that,
through the fifth order, the polynomial is unique at each order, and, in
general, these polynomials can be constructed from products of powers of the
second and third-order polynomials. The use of such a basis is illustrated in a
calculation of a light-front wave function in two-dimensional phi^4 theory; the
polynomial basis performs much better than the plane-wave basis used in

problem in multivariate cryptography. The main result is a randomized
polynomial-time algorithm for solving {\tt IP1S} for quadratic instances, a
particular case of importance in cryptography and somewhat justifying {\it a

instances of {\tt IP1S} (Agrawal and Saxena). To this end, we show that {\tt
IP1S} for quadratic polynomials can be reduced to a variant of the classical
module isomorphism problem in representation theory, which involves to test the
orthogonal simultaneous conjugacy of symmetric matrices. We show that we can
essentially {\it linearize} the problem by reducing quadratic-{\tt IP1S} to
test the orthogonal simultaneous similarity of symmetric matrices; this latter
problem was shown by Chistov, Ivanyos and Karpinski to be equivalent to finding
an invertible matrix in the linear space $\mathbb{K}^{n \times n}$ of $n \times

algebra. While computing square roots of matrices can be done efficiently using
numerical methods, it seems difficult to control the bit complexity of such
methods. However, we present exact and polynomial-time algorithms for computing
the square root in $\mathbb{K}^{n \times n}$ for various fields (including
finite fields). We then consider \\#{\tt IP1S}, the counting version of {\tt
IP1S} for quadratic instances. In particular, we provide a (complete)
characterization of the automorphism group of homogeneous quadratic
polynomials. Finally, we also consider the more general {\it Isomorphism of
Polynomials} ({\tt IP}) problem where we allow an invertible linear
transformation on the variables \emph{and} on the set of polynomials. A
randomized polynomial-time algorithm for solving {\tt IP} when
\(\mathbf{f}=(x\_1^d,\ldots,x\_n^d)\) is presented. From an algorithmic point
of view, the problem boils down to factoring the determinant of a linear matrix

viscosity and yield stress in the absence of magnetic field than
single-component suspensions of the same solid fraction, as a consequence of
the adsorption of the iron particles on the PMMA ones. The adsorbed layer of
iron particles on the PMMA ones is observed through optical microscopy of
dilute samples and confirmed by attenuated total reflectance. Microscopic
observations also show that the resulting non-magnetic-core-magnetic-shell
composites move upon magnetic field application and aggregate into particle
structures aligned with the applied field. These structures, which consist of
both types of particles, give rise to high values of the static and dynamic
yield stresses upon field application. Actually, both quantities are much
higher than those of a suspension with the same volume fraction of magnetic
particles, and increase when the amount of non-magnetic ones increases. These
trends are adequately predicted by a theoretical model that considers that the
main contribution to the yield stress is the change of the suspension magnetic
permeability when particle chains are deformed by the shear.

Here we discuss binary neutron star (NS-NS) mergers as a possible origin of
FRBs. The FRB rate is within the plausible range of NS-NS merger rate and its
cosmological evolution, while a large fraction of NS-NS mergers must produce
observable FRBs. A likely radiation mechanism is coherent radio emission like
radio pulsars, by magnetic braking when magnetic fields of neutron stars are
synchronized to binary rotation at the time of coalescence. Magnetic fields of
the standard strength (~ 10^{12-13} G) can explain the observed FRB fluxes, if
the conversion efficiency from magnetic braking energy loss to radio emission
is similar to that of isolated radio pulsars. Corresponding gamma-ray emission
is difficult to detect by current or past gamma-ray burst satellites. Since
FRBs tell us the exact time of mergers, a correlated search would significantly
improve the effective sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors.

determined by the spectral gap of the Hamiltonians involved in the simulation.
In ""standard"" constructions based on Feynman's Hamiltonian, such a gap
decreases polynomially with the number of gates in the circuit, L. Because a
larger gap implies a smaller cost, we study the limits of spectral gap
amplification in this context. We show that, under some assumptions on the
ground states and the cost of evolving with the Hamiltonians (which apply to
the standard constructions), an upper bound on the gap of order 1/L follows. In
addition, if the Hamiltonians satisfy a frustration-free property, the upper
bound is of order 1/L^2. Our proofs use recent results on adiabatic state
transformations, spectral gap amplification, and the simulation of
continuous-time quantum query algorithms. They also consider a reduction from
the unstructured search problem, whose lower bound in the oracle cost
translates into the upper bounds in the gaps. The impact of our results is that
improving the gap beyond that of standard constructions (i.e., 1/L^2), if
possible, is challenging.

in current cold atoms experiments. There, they set the stage for a new class of

ground-state properties of small unitary clusters computed numerically, but the

available virial coefficients. At unitarity, the phase diagram of the bosonic
system is universal in rescaled pressure and temperature. A triple point
separates the normal gas, the superfluid Efimov liquid, and a third phase, the
conventional superfluid gas. These two superfluid phases are separated by a
critical line that ends in a critical point at high temperature. This rich

Frieden-Soffer extreme physical information (EPI) statistical approach to the
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm (EPR-Bohm) experiment is shown. In order to obtain
the EPR-Bohm result, in addition to the observed structural and variational
information principles of the EPI method, the condition of the regularity of
the probability distribution is used. The observed structural information
principle is obtained from the analyticity of the logarithm of the likelihood
function. It is suggested that, due to the self-consistent analysis of both
information principles, quantum mechanics is covered by the statistical
information theory. The estimation of the angle between the analyzers in the
EPR-Bohm experiment is discussed.

ion-cyclotron waves propagating parallel to the large-scale magnetic field
through a homogeneous proton-electron plasma. The proton distributions and the
wave dispersions are related through the condition that no further
ion-cyclotron resonant particle scattering or wave growth/damping may take
place. The thermal anisotropy of the protons in these states therefore defines
the threshold value for triggering the proton-cyclotron anisotropy instability.
A number of recent papers have noted that the anisotropy of solar wind protons
at 1 AU does not seem to be limited by the proton-cyclotron anisotropy
threshold, even at low plasma beta. However, this puzzle seems to be due solely
to the estimation of this anisotropy threshold under the assumption that the
protons have a bi-Maxwellian distribution. We note that bi-Maxwellian
distributions are never marginally stable to the resonant cyclotron
interaction, so these estimates do not represent physically valid thresholds.
The threshold anisotropies obtained from our marginally stable states are much
larger, as a function of proton parallel beta, than the bi-Maxwellian
estimates, and we show that the measured data remains below these more rigorous
thresholds. Thus, the results of this paper resolve the apparent contradiction
presented by the solar wind anisotropy observations at 1 AU: The bi-Maxwellian
anisotropies are not rigorous thresholds, and so do not limit the proton
distributions in the solar wind.

competing phases at zero temperature. Collective excitations at magnetic QCPs
give rise to metallic properties that strongly deviate from the expectations of
Landau's Fermi liquid description, the standard theory of electron correlations
in metals. Central to this theory is the notion of quasiparticles, electronic
excitations which possess the quantum numbers of the bare electrons. Here we
report measurements of thermal and electrical transport across the
field-induced magnetic QCP in the heavy-fermion compound YbRh$_2$Si$_2$. We
show that the ratio of the thermal to electrical conductivities at the
zero-temperature limit obeys the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law above the critical
field, $B_c$. This is also expected at $B < B_c$, where weak antiferromagnetic
order and a Fermi liquid phase form below 0.07 K ($B = 0$). However, at the
critical field the low-temperature electrical conductivity suggests a
non-Fermi-liquid ground state and exceeds the thermal conductivity by about
10%. This apparent violation of the WF law provides evidence for an
unconventional type of QCP at which the fundamental concept of Landau
quasiparticles breaks down. These results imply that Landau quasiparticles
break up, and that the origin of this disintegration is inelastic scattering
associated with electronic quantum critical fluctuations. Our finding brings
new insights into understanding deviations from Fermi-liquid behaviour
frequently observed in various classes of correlated materials.

We can typically assume the property of extended stability, which allows

essentially behave as random noise in their effects on the actions. Another is
sequential irrelevance, where the unobserved variables do not influence future
observed variables. In the latter case, to deduce sequential ignorability in
full generality requires additional positivity conditions. We show here that
these positivity conditions are not required when all variables are discrete.

applying large deviation theory, specifically the Chernoff bound, to perform

DI Cha turns out to be a quadruple system with a hierachical structure,
consisting of two binaries: a G2/M6 pair and a co-moving pair of two M5.5
dwarfs. For both pairs we detected orbital motion (P~130 and ~65 years),
although in opposite directions. Sz 22 is a binary whose main component is
embedded in a circumstellar disc or reflection nebula, accompanied by a
co-moving M4.5 dwarf. CHXR 32 is a triple system, consisting of a single G5
star, weakened by an edge-on disc and a co-moving pair of M1/M3.5 dwarfs whose
components show significant variations in their angular separation. Finally,
Cha Halpha 5 is a binary consisting of two unresolved M6.5 dwarfs whose strong
variations in position angle at its projected separation of only 8 AU imply an
orbital period of ~46 years. DI Cha D and Cha Halpha 5 A&B are right at the
stellar mass limit and could possibly be brown dwarfs. In spite of various

archived 18 ks, Chandra ACIS observation of the SNR CTB 87 (G74.9+1.2),
classified as a PWN with unusual radio properties and poorly studied in X-rays.
We find that the peak of the X-ray emission is clearly offset from the peak of
the radio emission by ~100"" and located at the southeastern edge of the radio
nebula. We detect a point source - the putative pulsar - at the peak of the
X-ray emission and study its spectrum separately from the PWN. This new point
source, CXOU J201609.2+371110, is surrounded by a compact nebula displaying a
torus-like structure and possibly a jet. A more extended diffuse nebula is
offset from the radio nebula, extending from the point source to the northwest
for ~250"" The spectra of the point source, compact nebula and extended diffuse
nebula are all well described by a power law model with a photon index of 1.1
(0.7-1.6), 1.2 (0.9-1.4) and 1.7 (1.5-1.8), respectively, for a column density
N_H = 1.38 (1.21-1.57) x 10^22 cm^-2 (90% confidence). The total X-ray
luminosity of the source is ~1.6 x 10^34 erg s^-1 at an assumed distance of 6.1
kpc, with ~2% and 6% contribution from the point source and compact nebula,
respectively. The observed properties suggest that CTB 87 is an evolved (~5-28
kyr) PWN, with the extended radio emission likely a `relic' PWN, as in Vela-X
and G327.1-1.1. To date, however, there is no evidence for thermal X-ray
emission from this SNR, and the SNR shell is still missing, suggesting
expansion into a low-density medium (n_0 < 0.2 cm^-3, assuming D = 6.1 kpc),
likely caused by a stellar wind bubble blown by the progenitor star.

generate symmetries (are first class) and gauge-fix each other leaving two
propagating degrees of freedom.
  One of the sets is the Weyl generator tr$(\pi)$, and the other is a
one-parameter family containing the ADM scalar constraint $\lambda R-
\beta(\pi^{ab}\pi_{ab}+(\mbox{tr}(\pi))^2/2))$. The two sets of constraints can
be seen as defining ADM-type theories with a maximal slicing gauge-fixing. This
work provides an independent, first principles derivation of ADM gravity.
  The principles above are motivated by a heuristic argument relying in the
relation between symmetry doubling and exact renormalization arguments for
quantum gravity, aside from compatibility with the spatial diffeomorphisms. As
a by-product, these results address one of the most popular criticisms of Shape
Dynamics: its construction starts off from the ADM Hamiltonian formulation.
  The present work severs this dependence: the set of constraints yield reduced
phase space theories that can be naturally represented by either Shape Dynamics
or ADM. More precisely, the resulting theories can be naturally ""unfixed"" to
encompass either spatial Weyl invariance (the symmetry of Shape Dynamics) or
refoliation symmetry (ADM).

used to weight manifold paths with the exponential of minus the information
discrepancy of a particular manifold path with respect to full Liouvillean
evolution. The likelihood of a manifold member at a particular time is termed a
consistency distribution and is analogous to a quantum wavefunction. The
Lagrangian here is of modified generalized Onsager-Machlup form. For large
times and long slow timescales the thermodynamics is of Oettinger form. The
proposed path integral has connections with those occuring in the quantum
theory of a particle in an external electromagnetic field. It is however
entirely of a Wiener form and so practical to compute. Finally it is shown that
providing certain reasonable conditions are met then there exists a unique

the core regions of neutron stars to densities that are several times higher
than the density of ordinary atomic nuclei. At such huge densities atoms
themselves collapse, and atomic nuclei are squeezed so tightly together that
new particle states may appear and novel states of matter, foremost quark
matter, may be created. This feature makes neutron stars superb astrophysical
laboratories for a wide range of physical studies. And with observational data
accumulating rapidly from both orbiting and ground based observatories spanning
the spectrum from X-rays to radio wavelengths, there has never been a more
exiting time than today to study neutron stars. The Hubble Space Telescope and
X-ray satellites such as Chandra and XMM-Newton in particular have proven
especially valuable. New astrophysical instruments such as the Five hundred
meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), the square kilometer Array (skA),

International X-ray Observatory (now Advanced Telescope for High ENergy

non-rotating and rotating neutron stars. The latter are referred to as pulsars.
This paper provides a short overview of the impact of rotation on the structure

shed light on the core composition of neutron stars--and, hence, the properties
of ultra-dense matter--are discussed.

Phases, unit vectors in the (2l+1) dimensional representation spaces. For a
Gaussian distribution, Generalized Phases are random and if there is
non-Gaussianity, they represent most of the non-Gaussian information. The
alignment of these unit vectors from two maps can be characterized by their
angle, 0 deg expected for full coherence, and 90 deg for random vectors. We
analyze maps from both missions with the same mask and Nside=512 resolution,
and compare both power spectra and Generalized Phases. We find excellent
agreement of the Generalize Phases of Planck Smica map with that of the WMAP
Q,V,W maps, rejecting the null hypothesis of no correlations at 5 sigma for l's
l<700, l<900 and l<1100, respectively, except perhaps for l<10. Using
foreground reduced maps for WMAP increases the phase coherence. The observed
coherence angles can be explained with a simple assumption of Gaussianity and a
WMAP noise model neglecting Planck noise, except for low-intermediate l's there
is a slight, but significant off-set, depending on WMAP band. On the same
scales WMAP power spectrum is about 2.6% higher at a very high significance,
while at higher l's there appears to be no significant bias. Using our
theoretical tools, we predict the phase alignment of Planck with a hypothetical
perfect noiseless CMB experiment, finding decoherence at l > 2900; below this
value Planck can be used most efficiently to constrain non-Gaussianity.

argue in favor of a value E(B-V) = 0.57 +/- 0.02, which is significantly higher
than indicated by either the Burstein & Heiles or Schlegel et al. (corrected

across the face of the cluster, which we find to be present at the level of
Delta E(B-V) ~ 0.17 mag, is taken into account in our analysis. We measure
several metallicity indicators based on the position of the red giant branch

photospheric flux is in intermittent kG form. The ""green"" 5247-5250 line pair
is unique because it allows the magnetic-field effects to be isolated from the
thermodynamic effects. No other line pair with this property has since been
identified. In recent years much of the magnetic-field diagnostics has been
based on the ""red"" Fe I 6301.5 and 6302.5 {\AA} line pair, since it was chosen
in the design of the Hinode space observatory. Although thermodynamic effects
severely contaminate the magnetic-field signatures for this line ratio, it is
still possible to use it to extract information on intrinsic magnetic fields,
but only after it has been ""renormalized"", since otherwise it produces
fictitious, superstrong fields everywhere. In the present work we explore the
joint behavior of these two line ratios to determine how the ""contaminated"" red
line ratio can be translated into the corresponding green line ratio, which
then allows for a direct interpretation in terms of intrinsic magnetic fields.
Our observations are mainly based on recordings with the ZIMPOL-3
spectro-polarimeter at IRSOL in Locarno, Switzerland, complemented by data from
the STOP telescope at the Sayan solar observatory (Irkutsk, Russia). The IRSOL
observations are unique by allowing both the green and red line pairs to be
recorded simultaneously on the same CCD sensor. We show how the line ratios
depend on both the measured flux densities and on the heliocentric distance
(the \mu\ value on the solar disk), and finally derive the calibration function
that enables the red line ratio to be translated to the green ratio for each
\mu\ value.

2D lines as a function of staging depend on the charge transfer from K to the
graphite layers and on the lattice expansion. Ab-initio calculations of the

of the transferred charge remains on the graphene sheets adjacent to the
intercalant layers. This leads to an electronic decoupling of these ""outer""
layers from the ones sandwiched between carbon layers and consequently to a
decoupling of the corresponding Raman spectra. Thus higher stage GICs offer the
possibility to measure the vibrations of single, double, and multi-layer
graphene under conditions of biaxial strain. This strain can additionally be
correlated to the in-plane lattice constants of GICs determined by x-ray
diffraction. The outcome of this study demonstrates that Raman spectroscopy is
a very powerful tool to identify local internal strain in pristine and weakly
charged single and few-layer graphene and their composites, yielding even
absolute lattice constants.

supermassive black hole. For highly eccentric orbits, as one star is ejected
from the three-body system, the companion remains bound to the black hole.
Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) observed in the Galactic halo and S-stars observed
orbiting the central black hole may originate from such mechanism. In this
paper, we predict the velocity distribution of the ejected stars of a given
mass, after they have travelled out of the Galactic potential. We use both
analytical methods and Monte Carlo simulations. We find that each part of the
velocity distribution encodes different information. At low velocities < 800
km/s, the Galactic Potential shapes universally the observed distribution,
which rises towards a peak, related to the Galactic escape velocity. Beyond the
peak, the velocity distribution depends on binary mass and separation
distributions. Finally, the finite star life introduces a break related to
their mass. A qualitative comparison of our models with current observations
shows the great potential of HVSs to constrain bulge and Galactic properties.
Standard choices for parameter distributions predict velocities below and above
~800 km/s with equal probability, while none are observed beyond ~700 km/s and
the current detections are more clustered at low velocities 300-400 km/s. These
features may indicate that the separation distribution of binaries that reach
the tidal sphere is not flat in logarithmic space, as observed in more local
massive binaries, but has more power towards larger separations, enhancing
smaller velocities. In addition, the binary formation/evolution process or the
injection mechanism might also induce a cut-off at ~ 10 solar radii in the
separation distribution.

in a representative sample of 30 massive galaxy clusters at 0.15<z<0.30 from
the Local Cluster Substructure Survey (LoCuSS), combining wide-field Spitzer
24um data with extensive spectroscopy of cluster members. The specific-SFRs of
massive (M>10^10 M_sun) star-forming cluster galaxies within r200 are found to
be systematically 28% lower than their counterparts in the field at fixed
stellar mass and redshift, a difference significant at the 8.7-sigma level.
This is the unambiguous signature of star formation in most (and possibly all)
massive star-forming galaxies being slowly quenched upon accretion into massive
clusters, their SFRs declining exponentially on quenching time-scales in the
range 0.7-2.0 Gyr. We measure the mid-infrared Butcher-Oemler effect over the
redshift range 0.0-0.4, finding rapid evolution in the fraction (f_SF) of
massive (M_K<-23.1) cluster galaxies within r200 with SFRs>3M_sun/yr, of the
form f_SF (1+z)^7.6. We dissect the origins of the Butcher-Oemler effect,
revealing it to be due to the combination of a ~3x decline in the mean
specific-SFRs of star-forming cluster galaxies since z~0.3 with a ~1.5x
decrease in number density. Two-thirds of this reduction in the specific-SFRs
of star-forming cluster galaxies is due to the steady cosmic decline in the
specific-SFRs among those field galaxies accreted into the clusters. The
remaining one-third reflects an accelerated decline in the star formation
activity of galaxies within clusters. The slow quenching of star-formation in
cluster galaxies is consistent with a gradual shut down of star formation in
infalling spiral galaxies as they interact with the intra-cluster medium via
ram-pressure stripping or starvation mechanisms. We find no evidence for the
build-up of cluster S0 bulges via major nuclear star-burst episodes.

science. A method for implementing such an interface between dissimilar qubits
is quantum teleportation, which has attracted considerable interest not only as
a versatile quantum-state-transfer method but also as a quantum computational
primitive. Here, we experimentally demonstrate transfer of quantum information
carried by a photonic qubit to a quantum dot spin qubit using quantum
teleportation. In our experiment, a single photon in a superposition state of
two colors -- a photonic qubit is generated using selective resonant excitation
of a neutral quantum dot. We achieve an unprecedented degree of
indistinguishability of single photons from different quantum dots by using
local electric and magnetic field control. To teleport a photonic qubit, we
generate an entangled spin-photon state in a second quantum dot located 5
meters away from the first and interfere the photons from the two dots in a
Hong-Ou-Mandel set-up. A coincidence detection at the output of the
interferometer heralds successful teleportation, which we verify by measuring
the resulting spin state after its coherence time is prolonged by an optical
spin-echo pulse sequence. The demonstration of successful inter-conversion of
photonic and semiconductor spin qubits constitute a major step towards the

radiatively inefficient accretion discs, the energy, momentum and mass outflow
rates from such systems are estimated. Outflows occur via two fairly distinct
modes: a relativistic jet and a sub-relativistic wind. The jet power depends
strongly on the black hole spin and on the magnetic flux at the horizon. Unless
these are very small, the energy output in the jet dominates over that in the
wind. For a rapidly spinning black hole accreting in the magnetically arrested
limit, it is confirmed that jet power exceeds the total rate of accretion of
rest mass energy. However, because of strong collimation, the jet probably does
not have a significant feedback effect on its immediate surroundings. The power
in the wind is more modest and shows a weaker dependence on black hole spin and
magnetic flux. Nevertheless, because the wind subtends a large solid angle, it
is expected to provide efficient feedback on a wide range of scales inside the
host galaxy. Empirical formulae are obtained for the energy and momentum
outflow rates in the jet and the wind.

Unfortunately, in parallel, authoritarian regimes and other entities (such as

censoring the web. The policy, mechanism, and extent of this censorship varies
from country to country.
  We present the first study of the cause, effect, and mechanism of web
censorship in Pakistan. Specifically, we use a publicly available list of
blocked websites and check their accessibility from multiple networks within
the country. Our results indicate that the censorship mechanism varies across
websites: some are blocked at the DNS level while others at the HTTP level.
Interestingly, the government shifted to a centralized, Internet exchange level
censorship system during the course of our study, enabling our findings to
compare two generations of blocking systems. Furthermore, we report the outcome
of a controlled survey to ascertain the mechanisms that are being actively
employed by people to circumvent censorship. Finally, we discuss some simple

Contrary to the common belief in PPC Greece, we see that there are considerable
both short term (immediate) and long term effects of solar activity onto large
transformers in a mid-latitude country (latitude approx. 35 - 41 degrees North)
like Greece. Our results can be summarized as follows: For the short term
effects: During 1989-2010 there were 43 stormy days (namely days with for
example Ap larger or equal to 100) and we had 19 failures occurring during a
stormy day plus or minus 3 days and 51 failures occurring during a stormy day
plus or minus 7 days. All these failures can be directly related to
Geomagnetically Induced Currents (GICs). Explicit cases are presented. For the
long term effects we have two main results: The annual transformer failure
number for the period of study 1989-2010 follows the solar activity pattern (11
year periodicity, bell-shaped graph). Yet the maximum number of transformer
failures occur 3-4 years after the maximum of solar activity. There is
statistical correlation between solar activity expressed using various newly
defined long term solar activity indices and the annual number of transformer
failures. These new long term solar activity indices were defined using both
local (from geomagnetic stations in Greece) and global (planetary averages)
geomagnetic data. Applying both linear and non-linear statistical regression we
compute the regression equations and the corresponding coefficients of

fact turned into signal. More precisely, the non-Gaussianity introduced by
lensing in the SN Hubble diagram dispersion depends rather sensitively on the
amplitude sigma8 of the matter power spectrum. By exploiting this relation, we
are able to predict constraints on sigma8 of 7% (3%) for a catalog of 100,000

mitochondrial genes in kinetoplastids. The rapid spread and preservation of
pan-editing seems to be due to its concomitant fragment dispersal. Such
dispersal prevents losing temporarily non expressed mitochondrial genes upon
intense intraspecific competition, by linking non expressed fragments to parts
which are still needed. We mathematically modelled protection against gene
loss, due to the absence of selection, by this kind of fragment association.
This gives ranges of values for parameters like scrambling extent, population
size, and number of generations still retaining full genomes despite limited
selection. Values obtained seem consistent with those observed. We find a
quasi-linear correlation between dispersal and number of generations after
which populations lose genes, showing that pan-editing can be selected to
effectively limit gene loss under relaxed selective pressure.

to be Brownian motion, or ""white noise"", thus implying a Markov assumption. We
focus on the case when the driving noise is a fractional Brownian motion, which
is a common continuous-time modeling device for capturing long-range memory.
Since the likelihood is intractable, we proceed via data augmentation, adapting
a familiar discretization and missing data approach developed for the white
noise case. In addition to the other SDE parameters, we take the Hurst index to
be unknown and estimate it from the data. Posterior sampling is performed via a
Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm on both the parameters and the missing data
simultaneously so as to improve mixing. We point out that, due to the
long-range correlations of the driving noise, careful discretization of the
underlying SDE is necessary for valid inference. Our approach can be adapted to
other types of rough-path driving processes such as Gaussian ""colored"" noise.
The methodology is used to estimate the evolution of the memory parameter in US

suitable ratios, i.e., 99% from the cover image will be merged with 1% from the

proposed technique, the probability to reconstruct the original watermark image
is great. There is no perceptible difference between the original and
watermarked image by human eye. The experimental results show that the proposed

the dynamics and statistical distributions of many physical, chemical, and
biological systems using atomistic or coarse-grained models. It is often the
case, however, that the interparticle forces drive motion on many time scales,
and the efficiency of a calculation is limited by the choice of time step,
which must be sufficiently small that the fastest force components are
accurately integrated. Multiple time-stepping algorithms partially alleviate
this inefficiency by assigning to each time scale an appropriately chosen
step-size. However, such approaches are limited by resonance phenomena, wherein
motion on the fastest time scales limits the step sizes associated with slower
time scales. In atomistic models of biomolecular systems, for example,
resonances limit the largest time step to around 5-6 fs. In this paper, we
introduce a set of stochastic isokinetic equations of motion that are shown to
be rigorously ergodic and that can be integrated using a multiple time-stepping
algorithm that can be easily implemented in existing molecular dynamics codes.
The technique is applied to a simple, illustrative problem and then to a more
realistic system, namely, a flexible water model. Using this approach outer
time steps as large as 100 fs are shown to be possible.

UV produce strong continuous absorption in X-rays. The X-ray absorber is
believed to serve critically as a radiative shield to enable radiative driving.
However, ""mini-BAL"" and narrow absorption line outflows have dramatically less
X-ray absorption than BALs. Here we examine X-ray and rest-frame UV spectra of
8 mini-BAL quasars with outflow speeds in the range 0.1c to 0.2c to test
whether extreme speeds require a strong shield. We find that the X-ray
absorption is weak or moderate, with neutral-equivalent column densities N_H <
few times 10^22 cm^-2, consistent with mini-BALs at lower speeds. We use
photoionization models to show that this amount of shielding is too weak to
control the outflow ionizations and, therefore, it is not important for the
acceleration. Shielding in complex geometries also seems unlikely because the
alleged shield would need to extinguish the ionizing far-UV flux while avoiding
detection in X-rays and the near-UV.
  We argue that the outflow ionizations are kept moderate, instead, by high gas
densities in small clouds. If the mini-BALs form at radial distances of order R
~ 2 pc from the central quasar (broadly consistent with theoretical models and
with the mini-BAL variabilities observed here and in previous work), and the
total column densities in the mini-BAL gas are N_H ~< 10^21 cm^-2, then the
total radial extent of outflow clouds is only Delta-R_clouds ~< 3 x 10^13 cm
and the radial filling factor is Delta-R_clouds/R ~< 5 x 10^-6 for
weak/negligible shielding. Compared to the transverse sizes >~ 8 x 10^15 cm
(based on measured line depths), the outflows have shapes like thin ""pancakes""
viewed face-on, or they occupy larger volumes like a spray of many dense clouds
with a small volume filling factor. These results favor models with magnetic
confinement in magnetic disk winds.

first necessary to assess the magnitude of the problem. In the case of a web
search engine this assessment amounts to determining the current size of the
web, the growth rate of the web, and the quantity of computing resource
necessary to search it, and projecting the historical growth of this into the
future. Method: The over 20 year history of the web makes it possible to make
short-term projections on future growth. The longer history of hard disk drives
(and smart phone memory card) makes it possible to make short-term hardware
projections. Analysis: Historical data on Internet uptake and hardware growth
is extrapolated. Results: It is predicted that within a decade the storage
capacity of a single hard drive will exceed the size of the index of the web at
that time. Within another decade it will be possible to store the entire
searchable text on the same hard drive. Within another decade the entire
searchable web (including images) will also fit. Conclusion: This result raises
questions about the future architecture of search engines. Several new models
are proposed. In one model the user's computer is an active part of the
distributed search architecture. They search a pre-loaded snapshot (back-file)
of the web on their local device which frees up the online data centre for
searching just the difference between the snapshot and the current time.
Advantageously this also makes it possible to search when the user is
disconnected from the Internet. In another model all changes to all files are
broadcast to all users (forming a star-like network) and no data centre is
needed.

conductors, are a remarkable and initially counterintuitive example of how a
system can store information about its driving. In this class of memories, a
system can learn multiple driving inputs, nearly all of which are eventually
forgotten despite their continual input. If sufficient noise is present, the
system regains plasticity so that it can continue to learn new memories
indefinitely. Recently, Keim & Nagel showed how multiple transient memories
could be generalized to a generic driven disordered system with noise, giving
as an example simulations of a simple model of a sheared non-Brownian
suspension. Here, we further explore simulation models of suspensions under
cyclic shear, focussing on three main themes: robustness, structure, and
overdriving. We show that multiple transient memories are a robust feature
independent of many details of the model. The steady-state spatial distribution
of the particles is sensitive to the driving algorithm; nonetheless, the memory
formation is independent of such a change in particle correlations. Finally, we
demonstrate that overdriving provides another means for controlling memory
formation and retention.

crystal structure. The study of chemical doping effect is important in order to
either tune the Fermi level or refine the crystal quality. Here, we report the
magneto-transport measurement in high quality BiTeI single crystals with
different copper dopings. We found that a small amount of copper doping
improves the crystal quality significantly, which is supported by the transport
data showing higher Hall mobility and larger amplitude in Shubnikov-de Haas
oscillation at low temperature. Two distinct frequencies in Shubnikov-de Haas
oscillation were observed giving extremal Fermi surface areas of $A_{S} = 9.1

corresponding cyclotron masses $m_S^*$ = 0.0353 $m_e$ and $m_L^*$ = 0.178

structure calculations using three reported Te and I refined or calculated

  instability for low energy electron beams","7 pages, 4 figures",,,,"physics.acc-ph physics.plasm-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The microbunching instability usually exists in the LINAC of a free electron
laser (FEL) facility. In many cases, the longitudinal space charge (LSC) is a
dominant factor that generates the instability. For the highly bright electron
beams, the plasma effect is found to be non-trivial in the development of the
instability. In this paper, starting from the Vlasov and Poisson equations in
the multiple-dimensional phase space, we perform the straightforward analysis
of the microbunching instability based on the explicit formula of the
longitudinal electric field introduced by the density perturbation in the
longitudinal direction, in such a way to be highly comparable to the
well-developed method for higher energy beams. This method generally applies in
both the cases with and without acceleration and independent of lattice
components. The results show that for a electron beam with small transverse
emittance at low energies, which is always the case in the injector of a free
electron laser device, the plasma effect results in the oscillation of the
longitudinal electric field in the modified plasma frequency that depends on
the transverse size of the beam, and the Landau damping effect in the
longitudinal electric field due to the uncorrelated longitudinal velocity
spread during the beam transportation. These two effects both play important
roles in the development of the instability. As the result, the energy
modulation driven by the LSC impedance differs from the regular value
significantly and the discrepancy leads to the noticeable change of the final
gain of the instability.

et al. in a survey with the Parkes radio telescope at 1.4 GHz point towards an
emerging population of sources at cosmological distances whose origin is
currently unclear. Here we demonstrate that the scattering effects at lower
radio frequencies are less than previously thought, and that the bursts could
be detectable at redshifts out to about $z=0.5$ in surveys below 1 GHz. Using a
source model in which the bursts are standard candles with bolometric
luminosities $\sim 8 \times 10^{44}$ ergs/s uniformly distributed per unit
comoving volume, we derive an expression for the observed peak flux density as
a function of redshift and use this, together with the rate estimates found by
Thornton et al. to find an empirical relationship between event rate and
redshift probed by a given survey. The non-detection of any such events in
Arecibo 1.4 GHz survey data by Deneva et al., and the Allen Telescope Array
survey by Simeon et al. is consistent with our model. Ongoing surveys in the
1--2 GHz band should result in further discoveries. At lower frequencies,
assuming a typical radio spectral index $\alpha=-1.4$, the predicted peak flux
densities are 10s of Jy. As a result, surveys of such a population with current
facilities would not necessarily be sensitivity limited and could be carried
out with small arrays to maximize the sky coverage. We predict that sources may
already be present in 350-MHz surveys with the Green Bank Telescope. Surveys at

techniques of classical topology where the metric space of all-possible musical
data can be described explicitly, and via modern data-driven ideas of
persistent homology which calculates the Betti-number bar-codes of individual
musical works. Both analyses are able to recover three well known topological
structures in music: the circle of notes (octave-reduced scalar structures),
the circle of fifths, and the rhythmic repetition of timelines. Applications to
a variety of musical works (for example, folk music in the form of standard
MIDI files) are presented, and the bar codes show many interesting features.
Examples show that individual pieces may span the complete space (in which case
the classical and the data-driven analyses agree), or they may span only part
of the space.

observational uncertainties in the positions and motions of solar-system bodies
to set upper limits on possible differences $\Delta$ between the gravitational
and inertial mass of each body. For suitable pairs of objects, it is possible
to constrain three different linear combinations of $\Delta$ using Kepler's
third law, the migration of stable Lagrange points, and orbital polarization
(the Nordtvedt effect). Limits of order $10^{-10}-10^{-6}$ on $\Delta$ for
individual bodies can then be derived from planetary and lunar ephemerides,
Cassini observations of the Saturn system, and observations of Jupiter's Trojan
asteroids as well as recently discovered Trojan companions around the Earth,
Mars, Neptune, and Saturnian moons. These results can be combined with models
for elemental abundances in each body to test for composition-dependent
violations of the universality of free fall in the solar system. The resulting
limits are weaker than those from laboratory experiments, but span a larger

reproduce the charge density distribution using an integral equation given by
the perturbation theory. The reproduced density maps are confronted with the
original ones. The present study covers two-dimensional quantum dots of various
geometries and profiles with the one-dimensional (1D) quantum dot as a limit
case. We concentrate on large quantum dots for which strong electron-electron
correlations appear. For circular dots the correlations lead to formation of
Wigner molecules that in the presence of the tip appear in the laboratory
frame. The unperturbed rotationally-symmetric charge density is surprisingly
well reproduced by the mapping. We find in general that the size of the
confined droplet as well as the spatial extent of the charge density maxima is
underestimated for repulsive tip potential and overestimated for the attractive
tip. In lower-symmetry quantum dots the Wigner molecules with single-electron
islands nucleate for some electron numbers even in the absence of the tip.
These charge densities are well resolved by the mapping. The single-electron
islands appear in the laboratory frame provided that classical point charge
density distribution is unique, in the 1D limit of confinement in particular.
We demonstrate that for electron systems which possess a few equivalent
classical configurations the repulsive probe switches between the
configurations. In consequence the charge density evades mapping by the
repulsive probe.

pairing between two Fermions with opposite momenta (\textit{% i.e.}, zero total

Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) states, were predicted 50 years ago and
then widely studied in many branches of physics. However, whether FFLO

we show that Majorana fermions can exist in certain types of gapped FFLO

responsible for the dynamic profile of aroma release coats the pharyngeal
mucosa. The objective of the present article was to understand and quantify
physical mechanisms explaining pharyngeal mucosa coating. An elastohydrodynamic
model of swallowing was developed for Newtonian liquids that focused on the
most occluded region of the pharyngeal peristaltic wave. The model took
lubrication by a saliva film and mucosa deformability into account. Food bolus
flow rate and generated load were predicted as functions of three dimensionless
variables: the dimensionless saliva flow rate, the viscosity ratio between
saliva and the food bolus, and the elasticity number. Considering physiological
conditions, the results were applied to predict aroma release kinetics. Two
sets of conditions were distinguished. The first one was obtained when the
saliva film is thin, in which case food bolus viscosity has a strong impact on
mucosa coating and on flavour release. More importantly, we demonstrated the
existence of a second set of conditions. It was obtained when the saliva film
is thick and the food bolus coating the mucosa is very diluted by saliva during
the swallowing process and the impact of its viscosity on flavour release is
weak. This last phenomenon explains physically in vivo observations for
Newtonian food products found in the literature. Moreover, in this case, the
predicted thickness of the mix of food bolus with saliva coating the mucosa is
approximately of 20 $\mu$m; value in agreement with orders of magnitude found
in the literature.

experiments on hardened material lead to the conclusion that a tool path
implying stable cutting conditions might guarantee a better part surface

conventional strategies are not suitable. In this paper, an experimental
approach based on high-speed performance simulation is conducted on a master
bottom machining feature in order to highlight the influence of the curvatures
towards a suitable decomposition of machining area. The decomposition is
achieved through the construction of intermediate curves between the closed
boundaries of the feature. These intermediate curves are used as guidance curve
for the tool paths generation with an alternative machining strategy called
""guidance curve strategy"". For the construction of intermediate curves, key
parameters reflecting the influence of their proximity with each closed

Based on the results, a method for defining guidance curves in four steps is

that the cost of the star centred at this point and spanning all nodes is
minimised. The cost of the star is defined as the sum of the costs of its
nodes, where the cost of a node is an increasing function of the length of its
longest incident edge. The min-power centre problem provides a model for
optimally locating a cluster-head amongst a set of radio transmitters, however,
the problem can also be formulated within a bicriteria location model involving
the 1-centre and a generalized Fermat-Weber point, making it suitable for a
variety of facility location problems. We use farthest point Voronoi diagrams
and Delaunay triangulations to provide a complete geometric description of the
min-power centre of a finite set of nodes in the Euclidean plane when cost is a
quadratic function. This leads to a new linear-time algorithm for its
construction when the convex hull of the nodes is given. We also provide an
upper bound for the performance of the centroid as an approximation to the
quadratic min-power centre. Finally, we briefly describe the relationship
between solutions under quadratic cost and solutions under more general cost
functions.

other multiwavelength observations in the radio, soft, and hard X-rays, and the

high possibility of synchrotron flares during the mini-flare, indicative of a

inclination dwarf novae showing -- during their superoutbursts -- modulation of
the observed brightness of the disk with beat period. Simple model calculations
confirm earlier hypothesis that this modulation is due to a non-axisymmetric
structure of the outer parts of the disk, involving the azimuthal dependence of
their geometrical thickness, rotating with the beat period.
  The modulation amplitude $A_{mod}$ is found to decrease during
superoutbursts. In particular, it is found that during two superoutbursts of OY
Car the rate of decline of the superhump amplitude $dA_{SH}/dt$ was correlated
with the rate of decline $dA_{mod}/dt$. This leads to a simple explanation for
the decreasing amplitudes of superhumps: it is a consequence of the decreasing

J1731-347 / G353.6-0.7 shows no pulsations and exhibits a blackbody-like X-ray
spectrum. If the absence of pulsations is interpreted as evidence for the
emitting surface area being the entire neutron star surface, the assumption of
the measured flux being due to a blackbody emission translates into a source
distance that is inconsistent with current estimates of the remnant's distance.
Aims: With the best available observational data, we extended the pulse period
search down to a sub-millisecond time scale and used a carbon atmosphere model
to describe the X-ray spectrum of the CCO and to estimate geometrical
parameters of the neutron star. Methods: To search for pulsations we used data
of an observation of the source with XMM-Newton performed in timing mode. For
the spectral analysis, we used earlier XMM-Newton observations performed in
imaging mode, which permits a more accurate treatment of the background. The
carbon atmosphere models used to fit the CCO spectrum are computed assuming
hydrostatic and radiative equilibria and take into account pressure ionization
and the presence of spectral lines. Results: Our timing analysis did not reveal
any pulsations with a pulsed fraction above ~8% down to 0.2 ms. This finding
further supports the hypothesis that the emitting surface area is the entire
neutron star surface. The carbon atmosphere model provides a good fit to the
CCO spectrum and leads to a normalization consistent with the available
distance estimates of the remnant. The derived constraints on the mass and
radius of the source are consistent with reasonable values of the neutron star
mass and radius. After the CCO in Cas A, the CCO in HESS J1731-347 / G353.6-0.7
is the second object of this class for which a carbon atmosphere model provides
a consistent description of X-ray emission.

structure made of voids, sheets, filaments, and knots. The structure of this
so-called cosmic web is dictated by the local velocity shear tensor. In
particular, the local direction of a filament should be strongly aligned with
e3, the eigenvector associated with the smallest eigenvalue of the tensor. That
conjecture is tested here on the basis of a cosmological simulation. The cosmic
web delineated by the halo distribution is probed by a marked point process
with interactions (the Bisous model), detecting filaments directly from the
halo distribution (P-web). The detected P-web filaments are found to be
strongly aligned with the local e3: the alignment is within 30 degree for 80%
of the elements. This indicates that large-scale filaments defined purely from
the distribution of haloes carry more than just morphological information,
although the Bisous model does not make any prior assumption on the underlying
shear tensor. The P-web filaments are also compared to the structure revealed
from the velocity shear tensor itself (V-web). In the densest regions, the P-

that the adsorption configurations favoured by many transition-metal impurities

convection over six decades of Rayleigh number $(10^5<Ra_w<10^{11})$ and two
decades of Prandtl number $(0.7<Pr<600)$. We qualitatively identify the main
dynamics as motion along the plumes, lateral merging of the plumes and
initiation of the plumes; various other minor types of motion also occur along
with these main dynamics. The mean velocity along the length of the plumes
scales as the large scale flow velocity, with the fraction of the length of the
plumes affected by shear increasing with $Ra_w$ as $L_{ps}/L_p\sim Ra_w^{0.04}
Pr^{-0.1}$. In agreement with \cite{how}, the mean time of initiation of the
plumes $\bar{t^*}$, scales as the diffusive time scale near the plate,
$Z_w^2/\alpha$, where $Z_w$ is the appropriate length scale near the plate. The
fraction of the length of the plumes that undergoes merging decreases with
increase in $Ra_w$ as, $L_{pm}/L_p \sim Ra_w^{-0.04} Pr^{0.1}$. The plumes
merge with a constant velocity during their merging cycle, however, the values
of these constant velocities depend on the location and the time of
measurement. The merging velocities at all $Ra_w$ and $Pr$ have a common
lognormal distribution, but their mean and variance increased with increasing
$Ra_w$ and decreasing $Pr$. $\bar{V_m}$, which are an order lower than the
large scale velocities, scale as the average entrainment velocity at the sides
of the plumes. This implies that $\bar{V_m}$ scales as the velocity scale near
the plate $\nu/Z_w$. $Re_H$, the Reynolds number interms of $\bar{V_m}$ and the
layer height $H$ scales as $Ra^{1/3}$, in the same way as the Nusselt number
$Nu$; therefore $Re_{H}\sim Nu$. These relations imply that
$Re_w=\bar{V_m}Z_w/\nu$ the Reynolds number near the plate is an invariant for

using a gradient-based descent algorithm in which the Sobolev shape gradients

of this work is an accurate and efficient approach to the evaluation of the
shape gradients based on a boundary-integral formulation which exploits certain
analytical properties of the solution and does not require grids adapted to the
contour. This approach is thoroughly validated and optimization results
obtained in different test problems exhibit nontrivial shapes of the computed

automate several biochemical laboratory protocols such as clinical analysis,

biological assays, e.g., in bacterial susceptibility tests, samples and
reagents are required in multiple concentration (or dilution) factors,
satisfying certain ""gradient"" patterns such as linear, exponential, or
parabolic. Dilution gradients are usually prepared with continuous-flow
microfluidic devices; however, they suffer from inflexibility,
non-programmability, and from large requirement of costly stock solutions. DMF
biochips, on the other hand, are shown to produce, more efficiently, a set of
random dilution factors. However, all existing algorithms fail to optimize the
cost or performance when a certain gradient pattern is required. In this work,
we present an algorithm to generate any arbitrary linear gradient, on-chip,

(regular) magnetic fields in spiral galaxies are not axisymmetric, but
generally stronger in interarm regions. In some nearby galaxies such as NGC
6946 they are organized in narrow magnetic arms situated between the material
spiral arms. Aims. The phenomenon of magnetic arms and their relation to the
optical spiral arms (the material arms) call for an explanation in the
framework of galactic dynamo theory. Several possibilities have been suggested
but are not completely satisfactory; here we attempt a consistent
investigation. Methods. We use a 2D mean-field dynamo model in the no-z
approximation and add injections of small-scale magnetic field, taken to result
from supernova explosions, to represent the effects of dynamo action on smaller
scales. This injection of small scale field is situated along the spiral arms,
where star-formation mostly occurs. Results. A straightforward explanation of
magnetic arms as a result of modulation of the dynamo mechanism by material
arms struggles to produce pronounced magnetic arms, at least with realistic
parameters, without introducing new effects such as a time lag between Coriolis
force and {\alpha}-effect. In contrast, by taking into account explicitly the
small-scale magnetic field that is injected into the arms by the action of the
star forming regions that are concentrated there, we can obtain dynamo models
with magnetic structures of various forms that can be compared with magnetic
arms. (abbrev). Conclusions. We conclude that magnetic arms can be considered
as coherent magnetic structures generated by large-scale dynamo action, and
associated with spatially modulated small-scale magnetic fluctuations, caused
by enhanced star formation rates within the material arms.

large-amplitude hybrid gDor - dSct star with two clearly distinct frequency
domains. The large number of detected frequencies allows a detailed study of
the interaction between them. In addition, we can derive the fundamental
parameters of both components from the study of the eclipsing light curve.
After removing the eclipsing phases, we analyzed the data with the Period04
package up to S/N=4. The light curve was then prewhitened with these
oscillation frequencies to derive the fundamental parameters of the two
components. The eclipsing light curve analysis results in a (1.8+1.1)\,Mo
system, both components being main sequence stars. We detect 124 frequencies
related to luminosity variations of the primary. They are present in two
well-separated domains: 89 frequencies in the interval [0.30;3.64]/d and 35 in
the interval [14.57; 33.96]/d. There are 22 gDor frequencies separated by a
constant period interval Delta P = 0.03493 d. These frequencies correspond to a
series of g-modes of degree ell=1 with successive radial orders k. We identify
21 linear combinations between the first nine gDor frequencies. The dSct domain
is dominated by a large-amplitude frequency F=16.9803 /d. The eight first gDor
frequencies f_i are present with much lower amplitude in the delta Scuti domain
as F +/- f_i. These interactions between g- and p-modes confirm the phenomenon
we detected in another CoRoT star. The amplitude and the phase of the main
frequency F shows a double-wave modulation along the orbital phase, giving rise
to series of combination frequencies. Such combination frequencies are also

are represented by bag-of-words model with a dictionary of 4000 words.
Secondly, we learn the level-2 representations using two stacked RBMs for each

In
this paper, we develop an {\em evidence logic} for epistemic agents faced with
possibly contradictory evidence from different sources. The logic is based on a
neighborhood semantics, where a neighborhood $N$ indicates that the agent has
reason to believe that the true state of the world lies in $N$. Further notions
of relative plausibility between worlds and beliefs based on the latter
ordering are then defined in terms of this evidence structure, yielding our
intended models for evidence-based beliefs. In addition, we also consider a
second more general flavor, where belief and plausibility are modeled using
additional primitive relations, and we prove a representation theorem showing
that each such general model is a $p$-morphic image of an intended one. This
semantics invites a number of natural special cases, depending on how uniform
we make the evidence sets, and how coherent their total structure. We give a
structural study of the resulting `uniform' and `flat' models. Our main result
are sound and complete axiomatizations for the logics of all four major model
classes with respect to the modal language of evidence, belief and safe belief.
We conclude with an outlook toward logics for the dynamics of changing

account. It is found that the conductance oscillates with the Fermi energy, the
position and the aptitude of the $\delta$ doping. Also the conductance depends
sensitively on the direction of the magnetization of the two ferromagnets,
which originate from the control of the spin flow due to spin-momentum locked.
It is found that the conductance is the maximum at the parallel configuration
while it is minimum at the antiparallel configuration and vice versa, which may
stem from the half wave loss due to the electron wave entering through the
antiparallel configuration. These characters are very helpful for making new
types of magnetoresistance devices due to the practical applications.

period and its trend over the solar activity cycle are important for
understanding the Sun-Earth connection as well as for observational constraints
for solar models. Recently the SIM experiment on SORCE has published an
unexpected negative correlation with Total Solar Irradiance of the visible
spectral range. It is compensated by a strong and positive variability of the
near UV range. Aims. We aim to verify whether the anti-correlated
SIM/SORCE-trend in the visible can be confirmed by independent observations of
the VIRGO experiment on SOHO. The challenge of all space experiments measuring
solar irradiance are sensitivity changes of their sensors due to exposure to
intense UV radiation, which are difficult to assess in orbit. Methods. We
analyze a 10-year time series of VIRGO sun photometer data between 2002 and
2012. The variability of Spectral Solar Irradiance is correlated with the
variability of the Total Solar Irradiance, which is taken as a proxy for solar
activity. Results. Observational evidence indicates that after six years only
one single long-term process governs the degradation of the backup sun
photometer in VIRGO which is operated once in a month. This degradation can be
well approximated by a linear function over ten years. The analysis of the
residuals from the linear trend yield robust positive correlations of spectral
irradiance at 862, 500 and 402 nm with total irradiance. In the analysis of
annual averages of these data the positive correlations change into weak
negative correlations, but of little statistical significance, for the 862 nm
and 402 nm data. At 500 nm the annual spectral data are still positively
correlated with Total Solar Irradiance. The persisting positive correlation at
500 nm is in contradiction to the SIM/SORCE results.

perturbing an otherwise flat fracture. We investigate its influence on the
macroscopic hydraulic transmissivity and heat transfer efficiency, at fixed low
Reynolds number. In this study, numerical simulations are done with a coupled
lattice Boltzmann method that solves both the complete Navier-Stokes and
advection-diffusion equations in three dimensions. The results are compared
with those obtained under lubrication approximations which rely on many
hypotheses and neglect the three-dimensional (3D) effects. The lubrication
results are obtained by analytically solving the Stokes equation and a
two-dimensional (integrated over the thickness) advection-diffusion equation.
We use a lattice Boltzmann method with a double distribution (for mass and
energy transport) on hypercubic and cubic lattices. Beyond some critical slope
for the boundaries, the velocity profile is observed to be far from a quadratic
profile in the vicinity of the sharp asperity: the fluid within the triangular
asperity is quasi-static. We find that taking account of both the 3D effects
and the cooling of the rock, are important for the thermal exchange. Neglecting
these effects with lubrication approximations results in overestimating the
heat exchange efficiency. The evolution of the temperature over time, towards
steady state, also shows complex behavior: some sites alternately reheat and
cool down several times, making it difficult to forecast the extracted heat.

counting of higher bands in terms of composite fermions with an infinitely
strong short range interaction between an excited composite-fermion particle
and the hole it leaves behind. This interaction, the form of which we derive
from the microscopic composite fermion theory, eliminates configurations
containing certain tightly bound composite-fermion excitons. With this
modification, the composite-fermion theory reproduces,for all well-defined
excited bands seen in exact diagonalization studies, an exact counting for
$\nu>1/3$, and an almost exact counting for $\nu\leq 1/3$. The resulting
insight clarifies that the corrections to the nearly free composite fermion
theory are not thermodynamically significant at sufficiently low temperatures,
thus providing a microscopic explanation for why it has proved successful for
the analysis of the various properties of the composite-fermion Fermi sea.

upon Prieto et al. (2012) who studied in detail the merger-generated shocks,
and show that the conditions for HD cooling can be studied by combining these
results with a suite of dark-matter only simulations. We have performed a
number of dark matter only simulations from cosmological initial conditions
inside boxes with sizes from 1 to 4 Mpc. We look for haloes with at least two
progenitors of which at least one has mass M > M_cr (z), where M_cr (z) is the
SV06 critical mass for HD over-cooling. We find that the fraction of
over-cooled haloes with mass between M_cr (z) and 10^{0.2} M_cr (z), roughly
below the atomic cooling limit, can be as high as ~ 0.6 at z ~ 10 depending on
the merger mass ratio. This fraction decreases at higher redshift reaching a
value ~0.2 at z ~ 15. For higher masses, i.e. above 10^{0.2} M_cr (z) up to
10^{0.6} M_cr (z), above the atomic cooling limit, this fraction rises to
values ~ 0.8 until z ~ 12.5. As a consequence, a non negligible fraction of
high redshift z > 10 mini-haloes can drop their gas temperature to the Cosmic
Microwave Background temperature limit allowing the formation of low mass stars
in primordial environments.

Yang-Mills theory is continuously connected to a quantum phase transition in
softly-broken N=1 SYM theory on R^3 x S^1. The transition is semiclassically
calculable at small S^1 size L, occurs as the soft mass m_soft and L vary, and
is driven by a competition between perturbative effects and nonperturbative
topological molecules. These are correlated instanton--anti-instanton tunneling
events, whose constituents are monopole-instantons ""bound"" by attractive
long-range forces. The mechanism driving the transition is universal for all
simple gauge groups, with or without a center, such as SU(N) or G_2. Here, we
consider theories with fundamental quarks. We examine the role topological
objects play in determining the fate of the (exact or approximate)
center-symmetry in SU(2) SQCD, with or without soft-breaking terms. In theories
whose large-m_soft limit is thermal nonsupersymmetric QCD with massive quarks,
we find a crossover of the Polyakov loop, from approximately center-symmetric
at small 1/L to maximally center-broken at larger 1/L, as seen in lattice
thermal QCD with massive quarks and T=1/L. We argue that in all calculable
cases, including SQCD with exact center symmetry, quarks deform
instanton-monopoles by their quantum fluctuations and do not contribute to
their binding. The semiclassical approximation and the molecular picture of the
vacuum fail, upon decreasing the quark mass, precisely when quarks would begin
mediating a long-range attractive force between monopole-instantons, calling
for a dual description of the resulting strong-coupling theory.

systems. The discord for a pair of spins in the many-spin ground state is
related to the diagonal and off-diagonal spin-spin correlation functions and
the local magnetization. For isotropic and translationally invariant states,
the discord is shown to be a function of the diagonal correlation function
only. Thus, near a thermal/quantum critical point, the discord for a pair of
spins shows long-range behavior, analogously of the correlation function. The
discord exhibits a kink singularity as a function of the anisotropy parameter
for the the ground state of the Heisenberg model, for both nearest-neighbor
spins as well as for well-separated spins. The preferred measurement basis for
the minimum conditional entropy, which determines the discord, changes
discontinuously across the critical point. The conditional entropy distribution
over all possible the measurement basis is investigated. For the isotropic

thread of collisions and thus the breakdown of working satellites becomes worth
analyzing. Consequently, projects on removing objects from the important orbits

about the modelling and optimal path planning of a docking maneuver to an
uncontrollable tumbling target. After deriving the system dynamics, we
introduce boundary conditions to ensure a safe and realizable maneuver and a
general Bolza type cost functional to incorporate different optimization goals.
In order to solve the resulting problem, we transform the dynamics to a set of

method while perserving the energy of the system. The concluding simulation
results show the reliability and effectiveness of this approach.

wall at a disordered interface during field cooling (FC) which induces a
symmetry breaking of the antiferromagnet, without relying on any ad hoc
assumption about the coupling between the ferromagnetic (FM) and
antiferromagnetic (AFM) layers. The domain wall is a result of the disorder at
the interface between FM and AFM, which reduces the effective anisotropy in the
region. We show that the proposed mechanism explains several known experimental
facts within a single theoretical framework. This result is supported by Monte
Carlo simulations on a microscopic Heisenberg model, by micromagnetic
calculations at zero temperature and by mean field analysis of an effective
Ising like phenomenological model.

intermediate magnetic field strength. The acoustic moat is circled by the halo
of enhanced seismic amplitude as well as enhanced seismic emission. Overall,
the results suggest that features are related. However, if we narrow the

assumed scalar inputs at the nodes [4, 8]. Recent work has yielded approximate
Byzantine consensus algorithms for the case when the input at each node is a
d-dimensional vector, and the nodes must reach consensus on a vector in the
convex hull of the input vectors at the fault-free nodes [9, 13]. The
d-dimensional vectors can be equivalently viewed as points in the d-dimensional

  In our recent work [arXiv:/1307.1051], we proposed a generalization of the
consensus problem, namely Byzantine convex consensus (BCC), which allows the
decision to be a convex polytope in the d-dimensional space, such that the
decided polytope is within the convex hull of the input vectors at the
fault-free nodes. We also presented an asynchronous approximate BCC algorithm.
  In this paper, we propose a new BCC algorithm with optimal fault-tolerance

that a fine-grained aspect of Judy's affect, her annoyance at a particular kind

Seismic emission from regions whose continuum brightnesses are 95-100% of the

present physical diffusion behavior of CRs in actual turbulent magnetic fields,
model of which has been numerically tested. We perform test particle
simulations in compressible magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. We obtain
scattering and spatial diffusion coefficients by tracing particle trajectories.
We find no resonance gap for pitch-angle scattering at 90$^\circ$. Our result
confirms the dominance of mirror interaction with compressible modes for most
pitch angles as revealed by the nonlinear theory. For cross-field transport,
our results are consistent with normal diffusion predicted earlier for large
scales. The diffusion behavior strongly depends on the Alfvenic Mach number and
particle's parallel mean free path. We, for the first time, numerically derive
the dependence of M_A^4 for perpendicular diffusion coefficient with respect to
the mean magnetic field. We conclude that CR diffusion coefficients are
anisotropic in sub-Alfvenic turbulence and spatially correlated to the local
turbulence properties. On scales smaller than the injection scale, we find that
CRs are superdiffusive. We emphasize the importance of our results in a wide
range of astrophysical processes, including magnetic reconnection.

half of 2013 of the LHC Higgs Cross Section Working Group. The main goal of the
working group was to present the state of the art of Higgs Physics at the LHC,
integrating all new results that have appeared in the last few years. This
report follows the first working group report Handbook of LHC Higgs Cross
Sections: 1. Inclusive Observables (CERN-2011-002) and the second working group
report Handbook of LHC Higgs Cross Sections: 2. Differential Distributions
(CERN-2012-002). After the discovery of a Higgs boson at the LHC in mid-2012
this report focuses on refined prediction of Standard Model (SM) Higgs
phenomenology around the experimentally observed value of 125-126 GeV, refined
predictions for heavy SM-like Higgs bosons as well as predictions in the
Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model and first steps to go beyond these
models. The other main focus is on the extraction of the characteristics and
properties of the newly discovered particle such as couplings to SM particles,
spin and CP-quantum numbers etc.

functional theory in the study of high-pressure solid hydrogen at low
temperature. We calculate the phase diagram, metallization pressure, phonon
spectrum, and proton zero-point energy using three popular exchange-correlation
functionals: the local density approximation (LDA), the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof
(PBE) generalized gradient approximation, and the semi-local
Becke-Lee-Yang-Parr (BLYP) functional. We focus on the solid molecular
P$6_3$/m, C2/c, Cmca-12, and Cmca structures in the pressure range from
$100<P<500$ GPa over which phases I, II and III are observed experimentally. At
the static level of theory, in which proton zero-point energy is ignored, the
LDA, PBE and BLYP functionals give very different structural transition and
metallization pressures, with the BLYP phase diagram in better agreement with
experiment. Nevertheless, all three functionals provide qualitatively the same
information about the band gaps of the four structures and the phase
transitions between them. Going beyond the static level, we find that the
frequencies of the vibron modes observed above 3000 cm$^{-1}$ depend strongly
on the choice of exchange-correlation functional, although the low-frequency
part of the phonon spectrum is little affected. The largest and smallest values
of the proton zero-point energy, obtained using the BLYP and LDA functionals,
respectively, differ by more than 10 meV/proton. Including the proton
zero-point energy calculated from the phonon spectrum within the harmonic
approximation improves the agreement of the BLYP and PBE phase diagrams with
experiment. Taken as a whole, our results demonstrate the inadequacy of
mean-field-like density functional calculations of solid molecular hydrogen in
phases I, II and III and emphasize the need for more sophisticated methods.

comprehensive complexity classification of these problems, which strongly links
graph-theoretic properties of A to the complexity of the corresponding

given by this relation. This relation is defined in terms of a notion which we
call graph deconstruction and which is a variant of the well-known notion of
tree decomposition. We then use this hierarchy of graph classes to infer a
complexity hierarchy of homomorphism problems which is comprehensive up to a
computationally very weak notion of reduction, namely, a parameterized version
of quantifier-free first-order reduction. In doing so, we obtain a
significantly refined complexity classification of homomorphism problems, as
well as a unifying, modular, and conceptually clean treatment of existing
complexity classifications. We then present and develop the theory of
Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse-style pebble games which solve the homomorphism problems

yet been discovered at colliders: sparticles would be hidden in the intense
hadronic activity. However, if the known flavor structures are any guide, the
largest baryon number violating couplings are those involving the top/stop, so
a copious production of same-sign top-quark pairs is in principle possible.
Such a signal, with its low irreducible background and efficient identification
through same-sign dileptons, provides us with tell-tale signs of baryon number
violating supersymmetry. Interestingly, this statement is mostly independent of
the details of the supersymmetric mass spectrum. So, in this paper, after
analyzing the sparticle decay chains and lifetimes, we formulate a simplified
benchmark strategy that covers most supersymmetric scenarios. We then use this
information to interpret the same-sign dilepton searches of CMS, draw
approximate bounds on the gluino and squark masses, and extrapolate the reach
of the future 14 TeV runs.

transfer code MCFOST to model the data presented in this work. Results: The
CO(3-2) emission unveils for the first time at sub-millimeter frequencies the
vertical structure details of a gaseous disk in Keplerian rotation, showing the
back- and the front-side of a flared disk. Continuum emission at 850 microns
reveals a compact dust disk with a 240 AU outer radius and a surface brightness
profile that shows a very steep decline at radius larger than 125 AU. The
gaseous disk is more than two times larger than the dust disk, with a similar
critical radius but with a shallower radial profile. Radiative transfer models
of the continuum data confirms the need for a sharp outer edge to the dust
disk. The models for the CO(3-2) channel map require the disk to be slightly
more geometrically thick than previous models suggested, and that the
temperature at which CO gas becomes depleted (frozen-out) from the outer
regions of the disk midplane is T < 20 K, in agreement with previous studies.

reduction of the excitonic binding energy that can be extracted from the
renormalized saddle point resonance at 4.64 eV. Secondly, the real part of the
frequency-dependent conductivity is nearly completely suppressed below an
exposure-dependent threshold in the near infrared range. The clear step-like
suppression follows the Pauli blocking behaviour expected for doped monolayer
graphene. The nearly zero residual conductivity at frequencies below 2Ef can be
interpreted as arising from the weakening of the electronic self-energy. Our
data shows that mild oxygen exposure can be used to controlably dope graphene
without introducing the strong physical and chemical changes that are common in
other approaches to oxidized graphene, allowing a controllable manipulation of
the optical properties of graphene.

OJ287 is a quasar with a quasi-periodic optical light curve, with
the periodicity observed for over 120 years. This has lead to a binary black
hole model as a common explanation of the quasar. The radio jet of OJ287 has
been observed for a shorter time of about 30 years. It has a complicated
structure that varies dramatically in a few years time scale. Aims. Here we
propose that this structure arises from a helical jet being observed from a
small and varying viewing angle. The viewing angle variation is taken to be in
tune with the binary orbital motion. Methods. We calculate the effect of the
secondary black hole on the inner edge of the accretion disk of the primary
using particle simulations. We presume that the axis of the helix is
perpendicular to the disk. We then follow the jet motion on its helical path
and project the jet to the sky plane. This projection is compared with
observations both at mm waves and cm waves. Results. We find that this model
reproduces the observations well if the changes in the axis of the conical
helix propagate outwards with a relativistic speed of about 0.85c. In
particular, this model explains at the same time the long-term optical
brightness variations as varying Doppler beaming in a component close to the
core, i.e. at parsec scale in real linear distance, while the mm and cm radio
jet observations are explained as being due to jet wobble at much larger (100
parsec scale) distances from the core.

GMASS survey at z>1, primarily in their optical rest frame, using HST images,
from the CANDELS survey. We propose that the Hubble sequence of galaxy
morphologies takes shape at redshift 2.5<z<3. The fractions of both ellipticals
and disks decrease with increasing lookback time at z>1, such that at redshifts
z=2.5-2.7 and above, the Hubble types cannot be identified, and most galaxies
are classified as irregular. The quantitative morphological analysis shows
that, at 1<z<3, morphological parameters are not as effective in distinguishing
the different morphological Hubble types as they are at low redshift. No
significant morphological k-correction was found to be required for the Hubble
type classification, with some exceptions. In general, different morphological
types occupy the two peaks of the rest-frame (U-B) colour bimodality of
galaxies: most irregulars occupy the blue peak, while ellipticals are mainly
found in the red peak, though with some level of contamination. Disks are more
evenly distributed than either irregulars and ellipticals. We find that the
position of a galaxy in a UVJ diagram is related to its morphological type: the
""quiescent"" region of the plot is mainly occupied by ellipticals and, to a
lesser extent, by disks. We find that only ~33% of all morphological
ellipticals in our sample are red and passively evolving galaxies. Blue
galaxies morphologically classified as ellipticals show a remarkable structural
similarity to red ones. Almost all irregulars have a star-forming galaxy
spectrum. In addition, the majority of disks show some sign of star-formation
activity in their spectra, though in some cases their red continuum is
indicative of old stellar populations. Finally, an elliptical morphology may be
associated with either passively evolving or strongly star-forming galaxies.

corresponds to emergence of spacetime. We consider the case of pure Einstein's
gravity with a negative cosmological constant in the dual hydrodynamic regime.
The holographic RG flow is a system of first order differential equations for
radial evolution of the energy-momentum tensor and the variables which
parametrize it's phenomenological form on hypersurfaces in a foliation. The RG
flow can be constructed without explicit knowledge of the bulk metric provided
the hypersurface foliation is of a special kind. The bulk metric can be
reconstructed once the RG flow equations are solved. We show that the full
spacetime can be determined from the RG flow by requiring that the horizon
fluid is a fixed point in a certain scaling limit leading to the
non-relativistic incompressible Navier-Stokes dynamics. This restricts the
near-horizon forms of all transport coefficients, which are thus determined
independently of their asymptotic values and the RG flow can be solved
uniquely. We are therefore able to recover the known boundary values of almost
all transport coefficients at the first and second orders in the derivative
expansion. We conjecture that the complete characterisation of the general
holographic RG flow, including the choice of counterterms, might be determined
from the hydrodynamic regime.

through an incomplete orthogonal factorization with Givens rotations is
discussed and applied to Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs). The incomplete
Cholesky factor obtained from the incomplete orthogonal factorization is
usually sparser than the commonly used Cholesky factor obtained through the
standard Cholesky factorization. On the computational side, this approach can
provide a sparser Cholesky factor, which gives a computationally more efficient
representation of GMRFs. On the theoretical side, this approach is stable and
robust and always returns a sparse Cholesky factor. Since this approach applies
both to square matrices and to rectangle matrices, it works well not only on
precision matrices for GMRFs but also when the GMRFs are conditioned on a
subset of the variables or on observed data. Some common structures for
precision matrices are tested in order to illustrate the usefulness of the
approach. One drawback to this approach is that the incomplete orthogonal
factorization is usually slower than the standard Cholesky factorization
implemented in standard libraries and currently it can be slower to build the
sparse Cholesky factor.

explicitly represent disorder at the Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$/MgO interface, which
demonstrates a quenching of the minority-d IRS and significant reduction in

obviates the necessity to assume supercontinent cycles. Here, I review the
principles of Whole-Earth Decompression Dynamics and describe a new underlying
basis for geoscience and geology.

  Functional Theory","286 pages. This dissertation is an extended version of a M.Sc.Res.
  Thesis (Master of Advanced Studies / DEA). It comprises three parts: an
  specific introduction, a review of the statistical physics methods and
  formalism of DFT, and a part with the main results. It also included several
  appendices. Language: Spanish",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Two different theories are used to understand the liquid-vapor interfaces:
the Van der Waals theory and the capillary waves theory. But comparing both
come up a problem of interpretation of the interface density profiles obtained,
for example, with the Density Functional Theory (DFT). As a consequence emerge
the question of how the surface fluctuations are included on traditional
density profiles (usually named equilibrium density profiles). Last years, new
insights on the role of capillary waves were possible by analyzing X-ray
reflectivity experiments and performing computer simulations of liquids with
low melting temperature. In particular, the density profile exhibits a layering
structure which is considered a key property to elucidate a new interpretation
of those profiles as intrinsic density profiles. This dissertation aims to
investigate these questions within the DFT using simple fluids with a pairwise
interactions that reproduce important phase-diagram properties of liquid
metals. Two generics questions were explored: the relevance of Fisher-Widom
line and the role of capillary waves on the nature of interface obtained with
approximations WDA and FMT. It hypothesized the existence of a density profile
with strong layering properties whose structure is reduced by capillary waves.
Then the effect of surface fluctuations is described by introducing an
effective transversal size which imposes a limitation of the spectrum of
surface fluctuations incorporated on the DFT. However, an explicit methodology
to unfreeze the capillary waves over a postulated intrinsic profile exempt of
surface fluctuations was proven still a challenge. As a consequence it
suggested that other previous results describing the liquid surface using the
equilibrium DFT may conduct to unphysical properties.

some interesting results related to the densities of sequences. The method is
based on the direct construction of the Eratosthenes-type double sieve and does
not use empirical and heuristic reasoning.

  Strategies",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we study a generalized version of classical multi-armed bandits
(MABs) problem by allowing for arbitrary constraints on constituent bandits at
each decision point. The motivation of this study comes from many situations
that involve repeatedly making choices subject to arbitrary constraints in an
uncertain environment: for instance, regularly deciding which advertisements to
display online in order to gain high click-through-rate without knowing user
preferences, or what route to drive home each day under uncertain weather and
traffic conditions. Assume that there are $K$ unknown random variables (RVs),
i.e., arms, each evolving as an \emph{i.i.d} stochastic process over time. At
each decision epoch, we select a strategy, i.e., a subset of RVs, subject to
arbitrary constraints on constituent RVs.
  We then gain a reward that is a linear combination of observations on
selected RVs.
  The performance of prior results for this problem heavily depends on the
distribution of strategies generated by corresponding learning policy. For
example, if the reward-difference between the best and second best strategy
approaches zero, prior result may lead to arbitrarily large regret.
  Meanwhile, when there are exponential number of possible strategies at each
decision point, naive extension of a prior distribution-free policy would cause
poor performance in terms of regret, computation and space complexity.
  To this end, we propose an efficient Distribution-Free Learning (DFL) policy
that achieves zero regret, regardless of the probability distribution of the
resultant strategies.
  Our learning policy has both $O(K)$ time complexity and $O(K)$ space
complexity. In successive generations, we show that even if finding the optimal
strategy at each decision point is NP-hard, our policy still allows for
approximated solutions while retaining near zero-regret.

electricity cost. In this paper, we study the familiar problem of reducing data
center energy cost with two new perspectives. First, we find, through an
empirical study of contracts from electric utilities powering Google data
centers, that demand charge per kW for the maximum power used is a major
component of the total cost. Second, many services such as Web search tolerate
partial execution of the requests because the response quality is a concave
function of processing time. Data from Microsoft Bing search engine confirms
this observation.
  We propose a simple idea of using partial execution to reduce the peak power
demand and energy cost of data centers. We systematically study the problem of
scheduling partial execution with stringent SLAs on response quality. For a
single data center, we derive an optimal algorithm to solve the workload
scheduling problem. In the case of multiple geo-distributed data centers, the
demand of each data center is controlled by the request routing algorithm,
which makes the problem much more involved. We decouple the two aspects, and
develop a distributed optimization algorithm to solve the large-scale request
routing problem. Trace-driven simulations show that partial execution reduces
cost by $3\%--10.5\%$ for one data center, and by $15.5\%$ for geo-distributed
data centers together with request routing.

lower than in graphene (~9.2 eV). Moreover, the buckled nature of silicene
provides a large energy barrier for the healing of the SW defect and therefore
defective silicene is stable even at high temperatures. Silicene with SW
defects is semiconducting with a direct bandgap of 0.02 eV and this value
depends on the concentration of defects. Furthermore, nitrogen substitution in

has been a withstanding problem. Other approaches, such as Chern-Simons
gravity, suggest that quantum groups can be used to introduce $\Lambda$ in the
game. Not much is known when defining LQG with a quantum group. Tensor
operators can be used to construct observables in any type of discrete quantum
gauge theory with a classical/quantum gauge group. We illustrate this by
constructing explicitly geometric observables for LQG defined with a quantum
group and show for the first time that they encode a quantized hyperbolic
geometry. This is a novel argument pointing out the usefulness of quantum
groups as encoding a non-zero cosmological constant. We conclude by discussing
how tensor operators provide the right formalism to unlock the LQG formulation

folded RNA structures, but can also enhance the folding rates of large
ribozymes. Unlike the mechanism of urea-induced unfolding of proteins, which is
well understood, the action of urea on RNA has barely been explored. We
performed extensive all atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to determine
the molecular underpinnings of urea-induced RNA denaturation. Urea displays its
denaturing power in both secondary and tertiary motifs of the riboswitch (RS)
structure. Our simulations reveal that the denaturation of RNA structures is
mainly driven by the hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions of urea with the
bases. Through detailed studies of the simulation trajectories, we found that
geminate pairs between urea and bases due to hydrogen bonds and stacks persist
only ~ (0.1-1) ns, which suggests that urea-base interaction is highly dynamic.
Most importantly, the early stage of base pair disruption is triggered by
penetration of water molecules into the hydrophobic domain between the RNA
bases. The infiltration of water into the narrow space between base pairs is
critical in increasing the accessibility of urea to transiently disrupted
bases, thus allowing urea to displace inter base hydrogen bonds. This
mechanism, water-induced disruption of base-pairs resulting in the formation of
a ""wet"" destabilized RNA followed by solvation by urea, is the exact opposite
of the two-stage denaturation of proteins by urea. In the latter case, initial
urea penetration creates a dry-globule, which is subsequently solvated by water
penetration leading to global protein unfolding. Our work shows that the
ability to interact with both water and polar, non-polar components of
nucleotides makes urea a powerful chemical denaturant for nucleic acids.

almost all of the present theory was developed for linear networks without

  We also find AQ Mensae to be an eclipsing system. The eclipse depths are
highly variable, which suggests that the eclipses are grazing. This finding
raises the possibility of probing variations in disc tilt by studying
systematic variations in the eclipse profile.

containing an active pulsar, the Vela pulsar (PSR B0833-45). This pulsar is the
archetype of the middle-aged pulsar class and powers a bright pulsar wind
nebula (PWN), Vela-X, spanning a region of 2{\deg} x 3{\deg} south of the
pulsar and observed in the radio, X-ray and very high energy gamma-ray domains.
The detection of the Vela-X PWN by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) was
reported in the first year of the mission. Subsequently, we have
re-investigated this complex region and performed a detailed morphological and
spectral analysis of this source using 4 years of Fermi-LAT observations. This
study lowers the threshold for morphological analysis of the nebula from 0.8
GeV to 0.3 GeV, allowing inspection of distinct energy bands by the LAT for the
first time. We describe the recent results obtained on this PWN and discuss the

the use of end-to-end structured lattice codes with the amplify-and-forward

relays simply amplify and forward the received signals over the network to the
destination. We show that the end-to-end lattice-coded amplify-and-forward
scheme approaches the capacity of the layered Gaussian relay network in the
high SNR regime. Next, we extend our scheme to non-layered Gaussian relay
networks under the amplify-and-forward scheme, which can be viewed as a
Gaussian intersymbol interference (ISI) channel. Compared with other schemes,
our approach is significantly simpler and requires only the end-to-end design
of the lattice precoding and decoding. It does not require any knowledge of the
network topology or the individual channel gains.

Starting from
P. Schreiber's idea, published in 1993, we prove that these polygons are not
constructible from their side lengths with straightedge and compass, provided
$n$ is at least five. They are non-constructible even in the particular case
where they only have two different integer side lengths, provided that $n\neq
6$. To achieve this goal, we develop two tools of separate interest. First, we
prove a limit theorem stating that, under reasonable conditions, geometric
constructibility is preserved under taking limits. To do so, we tailor a
particular case of Puiseux's classical theorem on some generalized power
series, called Puiseux series, over algebraically closed fields to an analogous
theorem on these series over real square root closed fields. Second, based on
Hilbert's irreducibility theorem, we give a \emph{rational parameter theorem}
that, under reasonable conditions again, turns a non-constructibility result
with a transcendental parameter into a non-constructibility result with a
rational parameter. For $n$ even and at least six, we give an elementary proof
for the non-constructibility of the cyclic $n$-gon from its side lengths and,
also, from the \emph{distances} of its sides from the center of the
circumscribed circle. The fact that the cyclic $n$-gon is constructible from
these distances for $n=4$ but non-constructible for $n=3$ exemplifies that some
conditions of the limit theorem cannot be omitted.

spin polarization is large for momenta far from the center of the surface

enhanced tunneling realized systematically in thin insulating films, whereas
magnitude of the polarization saturates to the bulk limit faster at larger

state. In particular, we find an enhancement of two-neutron emission in
back-to-back directions. This is interpreted as a consequence of {\it dineutron
correlation}, with which the two neutrons are spatially localized before the
emission.

restriction to at most one contamination per time step. Because of a highly
discrete character of the process, the analysis cannot use the continous
approximation, widely exploited for most of the models. Using discrete approach
we investigate the epidemic threshold and the quasi-stationary distribution.
The main result is a theorem about mixing time for the process, which scales
like logarithm of the network size and which is proportional to the inverse of
the distance from the epidemic threshold. In order to present the model in the
full context, we review modern approach to epidemic spreading modeling based on
complex networks and present necessary information about random networks,
discrete-time Markov chains and their quasi-stationary distributions.

innovative society with faster progress, provided that the rate of adoption is
constant, which suggests a positive correlation between innovation and
technological disparity. Furthermore, the distribution is generally skewed in

dark matter searches offer a technology with strong particle identification
capability combined with the potential to produce a definitive detection of
Galactic Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) dark matter. A source of
events able to mimic genuine WIMP-induced nuclear recoil tracks arises in such
experiments from the decay of radon gas inside the vacuum vessel. The recoils
that result from associated daughter nuclei are termed Radon Progeny Recoils
(RPRs). We present here experimental data from a long-term study using the
DRIFT-II directional dark matter experiment at the Boulby Underground
Laboratory of the RPRs, and other backgrounds that are revealed by relaxing the
normal cuts that are applied to WIMP search data. By detailed examination of
event classes in both spatial and time coordinates using 5.5 years of data, we
demonstrate the ability to determine the origin of 4 specific background
populations and describe development of new technology and mitigation
strategies to suppress them.

(0.6 GeV/$c$ for $\rm\Lambda$) to 12 GeV/$c$. The $p_{\rm T}$ dependence of the
$\rm \Lambda$/K$^0_{\rm S}$ ratios exhibits maxima in the vicinity of 3
GeV/$c$, and the positions of the maxima shift towards higher $p_{\rm T}$ with
increasing collision centrality. The magnitude of these maxima increases by
almost a factor of three between most peripheral and most central Pb-Pb
collisions. This baryon excess at intermediate $p_{\rm T}$ is not observed in
pp interactions at sqrt(s) = 0.9 TeV and at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV. Qualitatively, the
baryon enhancement in heavy-ion collisions is expected from radial flow.

decouple from hydrodynamical-model calculations. For higher values of $p_{\rm

representations of the 8-vertex reflection algebra on spin-1/2 chains is here
implemented by introducing a quantum separation of variables (SOV) method which
generalizes to these integrable quantum models the method first introduced by
Sklyanin. More in detail, for the representations reproducing in their
homogeneous limits the open XYZ spin-1/2 quantum chains with the most general
integrable boundary conditions, we explicitly construct representations of the
8-vertex reflection algebras for which the transfer matrix spectral problem is
separated. Then, in these SOV representations we get the complete
characterization of the transfer matrix spectrum (eigenvalues and eigenstates)
and its non-degeneracy. Moreover, we present the first fundamental step toward
the characterization of the dynamics of these models by deriving determinant
formulae for the matrix elements of the identity on separated states, which
apply in particular to transfer matrix eigenstates. The comparison of our
analysis for the 8-vertex reflection algebra with that of [1, 2] for the
6-vertex one leads to the interesting remark that a profound similarity in both
the characterization of the spectral problems and of the scalar products exists
for these two different realizations of the reflection algebra once they are
described by SOV method. As it will be shown in a future publication, this
remarkable similarity will be at the basis of the simultaneous determination of
form factors of local operators of integrable quantum models associated to
general reflection algebra representations of both 8-vertex and 6-vertex type.

stars from atomic line indices while for late K and M stars, constituting the
majority of our sample, indices involving TiO and VO bands were used. To ensure
proper classification, particularly for reddened, veiled, or
nebula-contaminated stars, all spectra were then visually examined for type
verification or refinement. We provide an updated spectral type table that
supersedes Hillenbrand (1997), increasing the percentage of optically visible
ONC stars with spectral type information from 68% to 90%. However, for many
objects, repeated observations have failed to yield spectral types primarily
due to the challenges of adequate sky subtraction against a bright and
spatially variable nebular background. The scatter between our new and our
previously determined spectral types is approximately 2 spectral sub-classes.
We also compare our grating spectroscopy results with classification based on
narrow-band TiO filter photometry from Da Rio et al. (2012, finding similar
scatter. While the challenges of working in the ONC may explain much of the
spread, we highlight several stars showing significant and unexplained bona
fide spectral variations in observations taken several years apart; these and
similar cases could be due to a combination of accretion and extinction
changes. Finally, nearly 20% of ONC stars exhibit obvious Ca II triplet
emission indicative of strong accretion.

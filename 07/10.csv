desirable to exploit novel paradigms for tailoring electronic structures and
carrier dynamics in materials. Elastic strain can in principle be applied to
achieve reversible and fast control of such properties, but it remains a great
challenge to create and utilize precisely controlled inhomogeneous deformation
in semiconductors. Here, we take a combined experimental and theoretical
approach to demonstrate that elastic strain-gradient can be created
controllably and reversibly in ZnO micro/nanowires. In particular, we show that
the inhomogeneous strain distribution creates an effective field that
fundamentally alters the dynamics of the neutral excitons. As the basic
principles behind these results are quite generic and applicable to most
semiconductors, this work points to a novel route to a wide range of
applications in electronics, optoelectronics, and photochemistry.

distributed in different cavities constitute fundamental tasks in cavity
quantum electrodynamics. An interesting question in this context is how to
prepare entanglement and realize quantum information transfer between qubits
located at different cavities, which are important in large-scale quantum
information processing. In this paper, we consider a physical system consisting
of two cavities and three qubits. Two of the qubits are placed in two different
cavities while the remaining one acts as a coupler, which is used to connect
the two cavities. We propose an approach for generating quantum entanglement
and implementing quantum information transfer between the two
spatially-separated intercavity qubits. The quantum operations involved in this
proposal are performed by a virtual photon process, and thus the cavity decay
is greatly suppressed during the operations. In addition, to complete the
present tasks, only one coupler qubit and one operation step are needed.
Moreover, there is no need of applying classical pulses, so that the
engineering complexity is much reduced and the operation procedure is greatly
simplified. Finally, our numerical results illustrate that high-fidelity
implementation of this proposal using superconducting phase qubits and
one-dimenstion transmision line resonators is feasible for current circuit QED
implementations. This proposal can also be applied to other types of
superconducting qubits, including flux and charge qubits.

existence of landscape remains controversial. The causes include the mixed uses
of different landscape definitions with their own different aims and
advantages. Sometimes the difficulty and the impossibility of the landscape
construction for complex models are also equated. To clarify these confusions,
based on a recent formulation of Wright's theory, the current authors construct
generalized adaptive landscape in a two-loci population model with non-gradient
dynamics, where the conventional gradient landscape does not exist. On the
generalized landscape, a population moves along an evolutionary trajectory
which always increases or conserves adaptiveness but does not necessarily
follow the steepest gradient direction. Comparisons of different aspects of
various landscapes lead to a conclusion that the generalized landscape is a
possible direction to continue the exploration of Wright's theory for complex
dynamics.

stationary state wave function field propagates with finite speed, and
therefore reaches distant regions of the field with time delay.
  If a one-particle or multi-particle non-relativistic quantum system is
initially in a stationary state, and its wave function field is locally
perturbed, then perturbed and non-perturbed sub-regions appear in the region.
According to Schr\""odinger equation, borders of the perturbed sub-region
propagate with infinite speed, and the perturbation instantaneously affects all
infinite region. It means that Schr\""odinger equation predicts infinite speed
of the wave function perturbations propagation. This feature of classical
Schr\""odinger equation is traditionally interpreted as non-locality of quantum
mechanics. From physical point of view, such mathematical behavior of
Schr\""odinger equation solutions is questionable because it is difficult to
accept that in real world infinite physical objects can instantaneously appear.
  We introduce a hypothesis that in reality speed of propagation of the
perturbed sub-region borders is equal speed of light. On this basis we develop
and analyze a finite propagation speed concept for non-relativistic quantum
equations. It leads to local interpretation of non-relativistic quantum
mechanics consistent with principle of locality and free of local hidden
variables. The theory is applied to analysis of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)

inside-out formation process by gas accretion. We apply our method on a SINGS
subsample of ten spiral and dwarf galaxies for stellar bands covering from the
UV to the MIR. The CSPE models prove to be a good tool to weight the different
photometric bands in order to obtain consistent stellar discs' masses
regardless of the spectral band used. On the other hand, we show that colour
index vs. the mass-to-light ratio relation is an imperfect tool to assign
masses to young stellar populations because of the degeneracy affecting
mass-to-light ratio in all bands at low colour index. Resulting discs from our
analysis are compatible with the maximum disc hypothesis provided that adequate
bulge/disc decomposition is performed and correction for the presence of a bar

of $n$ points on the plane and a positive integer $k$, and the question is
whether there exists a set of at most $k$ lines which pass through all points
in $P$. A simple polynomial-time reduction reduces any input to one with at
most $k^2$ points. We show that this is essentially tight under standard
assumptions. More precisely, unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses to its
third level, there is no polynomial-time algorithm that reduces every instance
$(P,k)$ of PLC to an equivalent instance with $O(k^{2-\epsilon})$ points, for
any $\epsilon>0$. This answers, in the negative, an open problem posed by
Lokshtanov (PhD Thesis, 2009).
  Our proof uses the machinery for deriving lower bounds on the size of kernels
developed by Dell and van Melkebeek (STOC 2010). It has two main ingredients:
We first show, by reduction from Vertex Cover, that PLC---conditionally---has
no kernel of total size $O(k^{2-\epsilon})$ bits. This does not directly imply
the claimed lower bound on the number of points, since the best known
polynomial-time encoding of a PLC instance with $n$ points requires
$\omega(n^{2})$ bits. To get around this we build on work of Goodman et al.
(STOC 1989) and devise an oracle communication protocol of cost $O(n\log n)$
for PLC; its main building block is a bound of $O(n^{O(n)})$ for the order
types of $n$ points that are not necessarily in general position, and an
explicit algorithm that enumerates all possible order types of n points. This
protocol and the lower bound on total size together yield the stated lower
bound on the number of points.
  While a number of essentially tight polynomial lower bounds on total sizes of
kernels are known, our result is---to the best of our knowledge---the first to
show a nontrivial lower bound for structural/secondary parameters.

prominent \gamma-ray outbursts: 2009 Autumn, 2010 Spring, and 2010 Autumn. The
data reveal a repeating pattern, including a triple flare structure, in the
properties of each \gamma-ray outburst, which implies similar mechanism(s) and
location for all three events. The multi-frequency behavior indicates that the
lower frequency events are co-spatial with the \gamma-ray outbursts, although
the \gamma-ray emission varies on the shortest timescales. We determine that
the variability from UV to IR wavelengths during an outburst results from a
single synchrotron component whose properties do not change significantly over
the different outbursts. Despite a general increase in the degree of optical
linear polarization during an outburst, the polarization drops significantly at
the peak of the \gamma-ray event, which suggests that both shocks and turbulent
processes are involved. We detect two disturbances (knots) with superluminal
apparent speeds in the parsec-scale jet associated with the outbursts in 2009
Autumn and 2010 Autumn. The kinematic properties of the knots can explain the
difference in amplitudes of the \gamma-ray events, while their millimeter-wave
polarization is related to the optical polarization during the outbursts. We
interpret the multi-frequency behavior within models involving either a system
of standing conical shocks or magnetic reconnection events located in the
parsec-scale millimeter-wave core of the jet. We argue that \gamma-ray
outbursts with variability timescales as short as ~ 3 hr can occur on parsec
scales if flares take place in localized regions such as turbulent cells.

goods from a supplier to retailers through a shared warehouse. Each shipment
involves transporting goods from the supplier to the warehouse, at a fixed cost
C, followed by a redistribution of these goods from the warehouse to the
retailers that ordered them, where transporting goods to a retailer $\rho$ has
a fixed cost $c_\rho$. In addition, retailers incur waiting costs for each
order. The objective is to minimize the overall cost of satisfying all orders,
namely the sum of all shipping and waiting costs.
  JRP has been well studied in Operations Research and, more recently, in the
area of approximation algorithms. For arbitrary waiting cost functions, the
best known approximation ratio is 1.8. This ratio can be reduced to 1.574 for
the JRP-D model, where there is no cost for waiting but orders have deadlines.
As for hardness results, it is known that the problem is APX-hard and that the
natural linear program for JRP has integrality gap at least 1.245. Both results
hold even for JRP-D. In the online scenario, the best lower and upper bounds on
the competitive ratio are 2.64 and 3, respectively. The lower bound of 2.64
applies even to the restricted version of JRP, denoted JRP-L, where the waiting
cost function is linear.
  We provide several new approximation results for JRP. In the offline case, we
give an algorithm with ratio 1.791, breaking the barrier of 1.8. In the online
case, we show a lower bound of 2.754 on the competitive ratio for JRP-L (and
thus JRP as well), improving the previous bound of 2.64. We also study the
online version of JRP-D, for which we prove that the optimal competitive ratio
is 2.

favorable at finite temperature. At very low densities and moderate

field theory in the presence of boundaries, manifesting itself as a torque
anomaly. In particular, Fulling et al. used the finite energy-momentum-stress
tensor in the presence of a perfectly conducting wedge, calculated many years
ago by Deutsch and Candelas, to compute the torque on one of the wedge
boundaries, where the latter was cutoff by integrating the torque density down
to minimum lower radius greater than zero. They observed that that torque is
not equal to the negative derivative of the energy obtained by integrating the
energy density down to the same minimum radius. This motivated a calculation of
the torque and energy in an annular sector obtained by the intersection of the
wedge with two coaxial cylinders. In a previous paper we showed that for the
analogous scalar case, which also exhibited a torque anomaly in the absence of
the cylindrical boundaries, the point-split regulated torque and energy indeed
exhibit an anomaly, unless the point-splitting is along the axis direction. In
any case, because of curvature divergences, no unambiguous finite part can be
extracted. However, that ambiguity is linear in the wedge angle; if the
condition is imposed that the linear term be removed, the resulting torque and
energy is finite, and exhibits no anomaly. In this paper, we demonstrate the
same phenomenon takes place for the electromagnetic field, so there is no
torque anomaly present here either. This is a nontrivial generalization, since
the anomaly found by Fulling et al. is linear for the Dirichlet scalar case,
but nonlinear for the conducting electromagnetic case.

occurring independently with probability $p=p(n)$. In the online model,
vertices on one side of the graph are given up front while vertices on the
other side arrive sequentially; when a vertex arrives its edges are revealed
and it must be immediately matched or dropped. We begin by analyzing the
\textsc{oblivious} algorithm, which tries to match each arriving vertex to a
random neighbor, even if the neighbor has already been matched. The algorithm
is shown to have a performance ratio of at least $1-1/e$ for all monotonic
functions $p(n)$, where the performance ratio is defined asymptotically as the
ratio of the expected matching size given by the algorithm to the expected
maximum matching size. Next we show that the conventional \textsc{greedy}
algorithm, which assigns each vertex to a random unmatched neighbor, has a
performance ratio of at least 0.837 for all monotonic functions $p(n)$. Under
the $G(n,n,p)$ model, the performance of \textsc{greedy} is equivalent to the
performance of the well known \textsc{ranking} algorithm, so our results show

coarse correlated equilibria and sink equilibria, which we define as

also show that an abstract GSOS rule leads to new extended cia structures on

fundamental questions concerning the ontological, formal representational, and

algebras which admit calibrated or parallel G_2-/G_2^*-structures. Along the
way, we show that certain well-established curvature restrictions for
calibrated and parallel G_2-structures are not valid in the G_2^* case. In more
detail, we provide the first example of a Ricci-flat calibrated G_2^*-structure
on a compact manifold whose holonomy is not contained in G_2^*. Moreover, we
get examples of non-flat parallel G_2^*-structures on almost Abelian Lie

between lip muscle anatomy and variability in lip gestures and (b) the
constraints of coupled lip/jaw biomechanics on jaw posture in labial sounds.
Method: The authors used a model coupling the jaw, tongue, and face. First, the
influence of the orbicularis oris (OO) anatomical implementation was analyzed
by assessing how changes in depth (from epidermis to the skull) and
peripheralness (proximity to the lip horn center) affected lip shaping. Second,
the capability of the lip/jaw system to generate protrusion and rounding, or
labial closure, was evaluated for different jaw heights. Results: Results
showed that a peripheral and moderately deep OO implementation is most
appropriate for protrusion and rounding; a superficial implementation
facilitates closure; protrusion and rounding require a high jaw position; and
closure is achievable for various jaw heights. Conclusions: Models provide
objective information regarding possible links between anatomical and speech
production variability across humans. Comparisons with experimental data will
illustrate how motor control and cultural factors cope with these constraints.

analysis of randomized search heuristics (RSHs) such as evolutionary algorithms
(EAs), simulated annealing etc. The vast majority of existing drift theorems
yield bounds on the expected value of the hitting time for a target state,
e.g., the set of optimal solutions, without making additional statements on the
distribution of this time. We address this lack by providing a general drift
theorem that includes bounds on the upper and lower tail of the hitting time
distribution. The new tail bounds are applied to prove very precise
sharp-concentration results on the running time of a simple EA on standard
benchmark problems, including the class of general linear functions.
Surprisingly, the probability of deviating by an $r$-factor in lower order
terms of the expected time decreases exponentially with $r$ on all these
problems. The usefulness of the theorem outside the theory of RSHs is
demonstrated by deriving tail bounds on the number of cycles in random
permutations. All these results handle a position-dependent (variable) drift
that was not covered by previous drift theorems with tail bounds. Moreover, our
theorem can be specialized into virtually all existing drift theorems with
drift towards the target from the literature. Finally, user-friendly

formation on the atmospheric structure and the gas-phase abun- dances, are
utilised. The resulting element depletion leads to a shift in the
carbon-to-oxygen ratio such that several hydrocarbon molecules and
cyanopolycyanopolyynene molecules can be present. An increase in surface
gravity and/or a decrease in metallicity support the increase in the partial
pressures of these species. CO, CO2, CH4, and HCN contain the largest fraction
of carbon. In the upper atmosphere of low-metallicity objects, more carbon is
contained in C4H than in CO, and also CH3 and C2H2 play an increasingly
important role as carbon-sink. We determine chemical relaxation time-scales to
evaluate if hydrocarbon molecules can be affected by transport-induced
quenching. Our results suggest that a considerable amount of C2H6 and C2H2
could be expected in the upper atmospheres not only of giant gas planets, but
also of Brown Dwarfs. However, the exact quenching height strongly depends on

combined with a sample of foreground galaxies from SDSS-II, we estimate the
weak lensing convergence for each supernova line-of-sight. We find that the
correlation between this measurement and the Hubble residuals is consistent
with the prediction from lensing (at a significance of 1.7sigma. Strong
correlations are also found between the residuals and supernova nuisance
parameters after a linear correction is applied. When these other correlations
are taken into account, the lensing signal is detected at 1.4sigma. We show for
the first time that distance estimates from supernovae can be improved when
lensing is incorporated by including a new parameter in the SALT2 methodology
for determining distance moduli. The recovered value of the new parameter is
consistent with the lensing prediction. Using CMB data from WMAP7, H0 data from
HST and SDSS BAO measurements, we find the best-fit value of the new lensing
parameter and show that the central values and uncertainties on Omega_m and w

significance in this low redshift sample, will be of vital importance for the
next generation of surveys, such as DES and LSST, which will be systematics

allocation of resources, are divided into fixed groups. The network control
protocol is such that within each group agents get to share the resource and
across groups they contest for it. A prototypical example is the allocation of
data rate on a network with multicast/multirate architecture. Compared to the
unicast architecture (which is a special case), the multicast/multirate
architecture can result in substantial bandwidth savings. However, design of a
market mechanism in such a scenario requires dealing with both private and
public good problems as opposed to just private goods in unicast.
  The mechanism proposed in this work ensures that social welfare maximizing
allocation on such a network is realized at all Nash equilibria (NE) i.e., full
implementation in NE. In addition it is individually rational, i.e., agents
have an incentive to participate in the mechanism. The mechanism, which is
constructed in a quasi-systematic way starting from the dual of the centralized
problem, has a number of useful properties. Specifically, due to a novel
allocation scheme, namely ""radial projection"", the proposed mechanism results
in feasible allocation even off equilibrium. This is a practical necessity for
any realistic mechanism since agents have to ""learn"" the NE through a dynamic
process. Finally, it is shown how strong budget balance at equilibrium can be
achieved with a minimal increase in message space as an add-on to a weakly
budget balanced mechanism.

and therefore complements Ly$\alpha$ absorption line experiments probing the
neutral intergalactic medium (IGM). We present a new scheme to compute IGM
refractive scintillation effects on distant sources in combination with
Adaptive Mesh Refinement cosmological simulations. First we validate our model
by reproducing the well-known interstellar scintillation (ISS) of Galactic
sources. The simulated cosmic density field is then used to infer the
statistical properties of intergalactic scintillation. Contrary to previous
claims, we find that the scattering measure of the simulated IGM at $z<2$ is
$\langle \mbox{SM}_{\equ}\rangle=3.879$, i.e. almost 40 times larger than for
the usually assumed smooth IGM. This yield an average modulation index ranging
from 0.01 ($\nu_s=5$ GHz) up to 0.2 ($\nu_s=50$ GHz); above $\nu_{s}\gsim30$
GHz the IGM contribution dominates over ISS modulation. We compare our model
with data from a $0.3\leq z\leq 2$ quasar sample observed at $\nu_{\obs}=8.4$
GHz. For this high frequency ($10.92\leq \nu_s \leq 25.2$), high galactic
latitude sample ISS is negligible, and IGM scintillation can reproduce the
observed modulation with a 4% accuracy, without invoking intrinsic source
variability. We conclude by discussing the possibility of using IGM
scintillation as a tool to pinpoint the presence of intervening high-$z$
groups/clusters along the line of sight, thus making it a probe suitably
complementing Sunyaev-Zeldovich data recently obtained by \textit{Planck}.

that the typical dispersion of the waterfall field at the critical point is

manipulation of elementary excitations in complex systems. The combination of

different dynamics. For example, mid-infrared excitation induces field-driven
sub-cycle electron dynamics in nanostructure nearfields. Such frequency

decorrelate when the number of antennas at the base stations (BSs) increases,
thus strong signal gains are achievable with little inter-user interference.
Since these results rely on asymptotics, it is important to investigate whether
the conventional system models are reasonable in this asymptotic regime. This
paper considers a new system model that incorporates general transceiver
hardware impairments at both the BSs (equipped with large antenna arrays) and
the single-antenna user equipments (UEs). As opposed to the conventional case
of ideal hardware, we show that hardware impairments create finite ceilings on
the channel estimation accuracy and on the downlink/uplink capacity of each UE.
Surprisingly, the capacity is mainly limited by the hardware at the UE, while
the impact of impairments in the large-scale arrays vanishes asymptotically and
inter-user interference (in particular, pilot contamination) becomes
negligible. Furthermore, we prove that the huge degrees of freedom offered by
massive MIMO can be used to reduce the transmit power and/or to tolerate larger

of $\lesssim20 %$ of their lifetime, which is in reasonable agreement with
observed statistics. Assuming that photoevaporation controls disk clearing, we
find that initial angular momentum distribution of clouds needs to be weighted
in favor of slowly rotating protostellar cloud cores. Again, assuming inner
disk dispersal by photoevaporation, we conjecture that this skewed angular
momentum distribution is a result of fragmentation into binary or multiple
stellar systems in rapidly-rotating cores. Accreting and non-accreting
transitional disks show different evolutionary paths on the $\dot{M}-R_{\rm
wall}$ plane, which possibly explains the different observed properties between
the two populations. However, we further find that scaling the photoevaporation
rates downward by a factor of 10 makes it difficult to clear the disks on the
observed timescales, showing that the precise value of the photoevaporative
loss is crucial to setting the clearing times. While our results apply only to
pure photoevaporative loss (plus disk accretion), there may be implications for
models in which planets clear disks preferentially at radii of order 10 AU.

large-scale accretion still remains to be assessed in the context of massive
core/star formation. Studying the kinematics of the dense gas surrounding
massive-star progenitors can tell us the extent to which large-scale flow of
material impacts the growth in mass of star-forming cores. Here we present a
comprehensive dataset of the 5500(+/-800) Msun infrared dark cloud
SDC335.579-0.272 (hereafter SDC335) which exhibits a network of cold, dense,
parsec-long filaments. Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) Cycle 0
observations reveal two massive star-forming cores, MM1 and MM2, sitting at the
centre of SDC335 where the filaments intersect. With a gas mass of
545(+770,-385) Msun contained within a source diameter of 0.05pc, MM1 is one of
the most massive, compact protostellar cores ever observed in the Galaxy. As a
whole, SDC335 could potentially form an OB cluster similar to the Trapezium
cluster in Orion. ALMA and Mopra single-dish observations of the SDC335 dense
gas furthermore reveal that the kinematics of this hub-filament system are
consistent with a global collapse of the cloud. These molecular-line data point
towards an infall velocity V_{inf} =0.7(+/-0.2) km/s, and a total mass infall
rate \dot{M}_{inf} = 2.5(+/-1.0) x 10^{-3} Msun/yr towards the central pc-size
region of SDC335. This infall rate brings 750(+/-300) Msun of gas to the centre
of the cloud per free-fall time (t_{ff}=3x10^5 yr). This is enough to double
the mass already present in the central pc-size region in 3.5(+2.2,-1.0) x
t_{ff}. These values suggest that the global collapse of SDC335 over the past
million year resulted in the formation of an early O-type star progenitor at
the centre of the cloud's gravitational potential well.

masses while incorporating a viable dark matter candidate. This is possible by
extending the Standard Model with a single Majorana neutrino endowed with a
dark parity, a colour electroweak singlet scalar, as well as a colour
electroweak triplet scalar. Within this framework, the $up$-type quarks play a
special role, serving as a portal for dark matter, and a messenger for neutrino
mass generation. We consider three benchmark scenarios where the abundance of
dark matter can match the latest experimental results, while generating
neutrino masses in the milli-electronvolt range. We show how constraints from
lepton flavour violation, in particular the branching fraction of $\mu\to
e\gamma$, can place lower bounds on the coupling between our dark matter
candidate and top quarks. Furthermore, we show that this coupling can also be
constrained using collider data from the Tevatron and the LHC.

beta (0\nu\beta\beta) decay of ^{76}Ge using germanium diodes as source and
detector. In Phase I of the experiment eight semi-coaxial and five BEGe type
detectors have been deployed. The latter type is used in this field of research
for the first time. All detectors are made from material with enriched ^{76}Ge
fraction. The experimental sensitivity can be improved by analyzing the pulse
shape of the detector signals with the aim to reject background events. This
paper documents the algorithms developed before the data of Phase I were
unblinded. The double escape peak (DEP) and Compton edge events of 2.615 MeV
\gamma\ rays from ^{208}Tl decays as well as 2\nu\beta\beta\ decays of ^{76}Ge
are used as proxies for 0\nu\beta\beta\ decay. For BEGe detectors the chosen
selection is based on a single pulse shape parameter. It accepts 0.92$\pm$0.02
of signal-like events while about 80% of the background events at
Q_{\beta\beta}=2039 keV are rejected.
  For semi-coaxial detectors three analyses are developed. The one based on an
artificial neural network is used for the search of 0\nu\beta\beta\ decay. It
retains 90% of DEP events and rejects about half of the events around
Q_{\beta\beta}. The 2\nu\beta\beta\ events have an efficiency of 0.85\pm0.02
and the one for 0\nu\beta\beta\ decays is estimated to be 0.90^{+0.05}_{-0.09}.
A second analysis uses a likelihood approach trained on Compton edge events.
The third approach uses two pulse shape parameters. The latter two methods
confirm the classification of the neural network since about 90% of the data
events rejected by the neural network are also removed by both of them. In
general, the selection efficiency extracted from DEP events agrees well with
those determined from Compton edge events or from 2\nu\beta\beta\ decays.

  Network Analysis",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graphical models have gained a lot of attention recently as a tool for
learning and representing dependencies among variables in multivariate data.
Often, domain scientists are looking specifically for differences among the
dependency networks of different conditions or populations (e.g. differences
between regulatory networks of different species, or differences between
dependency networks of diseased versus healthy populations). The standard
method for finding these differences is to learn the dependency networks for
each condition independently and compare them. We show that this approach is
prone to high false discovery rates (low precision) that can render the
analysis useless. We then show that by imposing a bias towards learning similar
dependency networks for each condition the false discovery rates can be reduced
to acceptable levels, at the cost of finding a reduced number of differences.
Algorithms developed in the transfer learning literature can be used to vary
the strength of the imposed similarity bias and provide a natural mechanism to
smoothly adjust this differential precision-recall tradeoff to cater to the
requirements of the analysis conducted. We present real case studies
(oncological and neurological) where domain experts use the proposed technique
to extract useful differential networks that shed light on the biological
processes involved in cancer and brain function.

M_{A_2})$, move along classical trajectories $\vec R_1(t)$ and $\vec R_2(t)$
respectively, while the dynamics of the lighter neutron, n, is considered from
a quantum mechanical point of view. Here, $M_i$ are the nucleon masses and
$Z_i$ are the Coulomb charges of the heavy nuclei ($i=1,2$). A Faddeev-type
semiclassical formulation using realistic paired nuclear-nuclear potentials is
applied so that all three channels (elastic, rearrangement and break-up) are
described in an unified manner. In order to solve these time-dependent
equations the Faddeev components of the total three-body wave-function are
expanded in terms of the input and output channel target eigenfunctions. In the
special case when the nuclear cores are identical (A$_1 \equiv$ A$_2$) and the
two-level approximation in the expansion over target functions the
time-dependent semiclassical Faddeev equations are resolved in an explicit way.
To determine the realistic $\vec R_1(t)$ and $\vec R_2(t)$ trajectories of the
nuclear cores a self-consistent approach based on the Feynman path integral
theory is applied.

two prototypical low-luminosity outflows L1448 and L1157. Previous HIFI H2O
observations (E_u=53-249 K) and complementary Spitzer mid-IR H2 data are also
used, with the aim of deriving a complete picture of the excitation conditions.
At all selected spots a close spatial association between H2O, mid-IR H2, and
high-J CO emission is found, whereas the low-J CO emission traces either
entrained ambient gas or a remnant of an older shock. The excitation analysis
at L1448-B2 suggests that a two-component model is needed to reproduce the H2O,
CO, and mid-IR H2 lines: an extended warm component (T~450 K) is traced by the
H2O emission with E_u =53-137 K and by the CO lines up to J=22-21, and a
compact hot component (T=1100 K) is traced by the H2O emission with E_u>190 K
and by the higher-J CO lines. At L1448-B2 we obtain an H2O abundance
(3-4)x10^{-6} for the warm component and (0.3-1.3)x10^{-5} for the hot
component; we also detect OH and blue-shifted [OI] emission, spatially
coincident with the other molecular lines and with [FeII] emission. This
suggests a dissociative shock for these species, related to the embedded atomic
jet. On the other hand, a non-dissociative shock at the point of impact of the
jet on the cloud is responsible for the H2O and CO emission. The other examined
shock positions show an H2O excitation similar to L1448-B2, but a slightly
higher H2O abundance (a factor of 4). The two gas components may represent a
gas stratification in the post-shock region. The extended and low-abundance
warm component traces the post-shocked gas that has already cooled down to a
few hundred Kelvin, whereas the compact and possibly higher-abundance hot
component is associated with the gas that is currently undergoing a shock
episode.

vibrations and has not been previously resolved by any technique. This study
advances STM/STS as a method for quantitatively probing many-body interactions.
Combined with the spatial sensitivity of STM/STS, this technique opens a new

All-sky Survey (GOALS) sample, obtained with the PACS instrument on board
Herschel. The [CII] luminosities of the LIRGs in GOALS range from ~10^7 to
2x10^9 Lsun. We find that LIRGs show a tight correlation of [CII]/FIR with
far-IR flux density ratios, with a strong negative trend spanning from ~10^-2
to 10^-4, as the average temperature of dust increases. We find correlations
between the [CII]/FIR ratio and the strength of the 9.7um silicate absorption
feature as well as with the luminosity surface density of the mid-IR emitting
region (Sigma_MIR), suggesting that warmer, more compact starbursts have
substantially smaller [CII]/FIR ratios. Pure star-forming (SF) LIRGs have a
mean [CII]/FIR ~ 4x10^-3, while galaxies with low 6.2um PAH equivalent widths
(EWs), indicative of the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGN), span the
full range in [CII]/FIR. However, we show that even when only pure SF galaxies
are considered, the [CII]/FIR ratio drops by an order of magnitude, from 10^-2
to 10^-3, with Sigma_MIR and Sigma_IR, implying that the [CII] luminosity is
not a good indicator of the star formation rate (SFR) for most LIRGs, for it
does not scale linearly with the warm dust emission. Moreover, even in LIRGs in
which we detect an AGN in the mid-IR, the majority (2/3) of galaxies show
[CII]/FIR >= 10^-3 typical of high 6.2um PAH EW sources, suggesting that most
AGNs do not contribute significantly to the far-IR emission. We provide an
empirical relation between the [CII]/FIR and the specific SFR (SSFR) for SF
LIRGs. Finally, we present predictions for the starburst size based on the
observed [CII] and far-IR luminosities which should be useful for comparing
with results from future surveys of high-redshift galaxies with ALMA and CCAT.

  The multi-slabs structure is generated via a Kronig-Penney potential
perpendicular to the slabs of width $a$ and separated by a distance $b$. The
ability of the particles to jump between adjacent slabs is determined by the
hight $V_0$ and width $b$ of the potential barrier. Contrary to what happens in
the boson gas inside a zero-width multilayers case, where the critical
temperature diminishes and goes up again as a function of the wall separation,
here the $T_c$ decreases continuously as the potential barrier height and the
cell size $a+b$ increase. We plot the surface $T_c = 10^{-6}$ showing two
prominent regions in the parameters space, which suggest a phase transition
BEC-NOBEC at $T \neq 0$. %The position of the phase transition surface is
almost independent of the ratio $r=b/a$ while the cell size $a+b$ is almost
proportional to the square root of the height of the potential barriers. The
specific heat shows a crossover from 3D to 2D when the height of the potential

gravitational-wave (GW) signal corresponding to the final inspiral of the
compact binary. In addition, the radioactive decay of elements produced in NS
binary mergers may result in transients visible in the optical and infrared
with peak luminosities on hours-days timescales. Simultaneous observations of
the inspiral GWs and signatures in the electromagnetic band may allow us to
directly and independently determine both the luminosity distance and redshift
to a binary. These standard sirens (the GW analog of standard candles) have the
potential to provide an accurate measurement of the low-redshift Hubble flow.
In addition, these systems are absolutely calibrated by general relativity, and
therefore do not experience the same set of astrophysical systematics found in
traditional standard candles, nor do the measurements rely on a distance
ladder. We show that 15 observable GW and EM events should allow the Hubble
constant to be measured with 5% precision using a network of detectors that
includes advanced LIGO and Virgo. Measuring 30 beamed GW-SGRB events could
constrain H_0 to better than 1%. When comparing to standard Gaussian likelihood
analysis, we find that each event's non-Gaussian posterior in H_0 helps reduce

We numerically compute the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant and spin Chern number

characterize the topological phases and identify the critical points of

only expected upon approaching the thermodynamic limit. For the Hubbard models
we considered, the QMC results show that correlation effects lead to shifts in
the phase boundaries relative to those in the non-interacting limit, without

simulation in the early-universe stage is slow due to the oscillations of the

covariance matrix are concerned about the accuracy of estimating the covariance
matrix (and precision matrix), relatively less is known about the effect of
estimating large covariances on statistical inferences. We study two important
models: factor analysis and panel data model with interactive effects, and
focus on the statistical inference and estimation efficiency of structural
parameters based on large covariance estimators. For efficient estimation, both
models call for a weighted principle components (WPC), which relies on a high
dimensional weight matrix. This paper derives an efficient and feasible WPC
using the covariance matrix estimator of Fan et al. (2013). However, we
demonstrate that existing results on large covariance estimation based on
absolute convergence are not suitable for statistical inferences of the
structural parameters. What is needed is some weighted consistency and the
associated rate of convergence, which are obtained in this paper. Finally, the
proposed method is applied to the US divorce rate data. We find that the
efficient WPC identifies the significant effects of divorce-law reforms on the
divorce rate, and it provides more accurate estimation and tighter confidence
intervals than existing methods.

strong stellar winds. We show that the GRB blast wave in the wind should emit a
bright GeV flash. It is produced by inverse Compton cooling of the thermal
plasma behind the forward shock wave. The main part of the flash is shaped by
scattering of the prompt MeV radiation (emitted at smaller radii) which streams
through the external blast wave. The inverse-Compton flash is bright due to the
huge e+- enrichment of the external medium. At late times, the blast wave
switches to normal synchrotron-self-Compton cooling. The mechanism is
demonstrated by a detailed transfer simulation. The observed prompt MeV
radiation is taken as an input of the simulation; we use GRB 080916C as an
example. The result reproduces the GeV flash observed by the Fermi telescope.
It explains the delayed onset, the steep rise, the peak flux, the time of the
peak, the long smooth decline, and the spectral slope of GeV emission. The wind
density required to reproduce all these features is typical of Wolf-Rayet
stars. Our simulation predicts strong TeV emission 1 min after the burst
trigger; then a cutoff in the observed high-energy spectrum is expected from
absorption by extragalactic background light. In addition, a bright optical
counterpart of the GeV flash is predicted for plausible values of the magnetic
field; such a double (optical+GeV) flash has been observed in GRB 130427A.

the dust scattering nature of the FUV continuum. We performed Monte-Carlo

70$^{+4}_{-8}$ pc and 40$^{+8}_{-10}$ pc, respectively. The diffuse FUV
continuum in the northern region above Spica was mostly the result of

solutions such as the Laplace and the Stokes equations. Numerical examples
demonstrate that the scheme is capable of computing solutions with relative
accuracy of $10^{-10}$ or better, even for challenging problems such as highly

equations. In terms of speed, it is demonstrated that a problem with a
non-oscillatory solution that was discretized using $10^{8}$ nodes was solved
in 115 minutes on a personal work-station with two quad-core 3.3GHz CPUs. Since
the solver is direct, and the ""solution operator"" fits in RAM, any solves
beyond the first are very fast. In the example with $10^{8}$ unknowns, solves
require only 30 seconds.

networks, an architecture involving a base station along with caching femto
stations (referred to as helpers), storing popular files near users, has been
proposed [1]. The primary benefit of caching is the enormous increase in
downloading rate when a popular file is available at helpers near a user
requesting that file. In this work, we explore a secondary benefit of caching
in this architecture through the lens of index coding. We assume a system with
n users and constant number of caching helpers. Only helpers store files, i.e.
have side information. We investigate the following scenario: Each user
requests a distinct file that is not found in the set of helpers nearby. Users
are served coded packets (through an index code) by an omniscient base station.
Every user decodes its desired packet from the coded packets and the side
information packets from helpers nearby. We assume that users can obtain any
file stored in their neighboring helpers without incurring transmission costs.
With respect to the index code employed, we investigate two achievable schemes:
1) XOR coloring based on coloring of the side information graph associated with
the problem and 2)Vector XOR coloring based on fractional coloring of the side
information graph. We show that the general problem reduces to a canonical
problem where every user is connected to exactly one helper under some
topological constraints. For the canonical problem, with constant number of
helpers (k), we show that the complexity of computing the best XOR/vector XOR
coloring schemes are polynomial in the number of users n. The result exploits a
special complete bi-partite structure that the side information graphs exhibit
for any finite k.

a strategy to control heterogenous ice nucleation and snow crystal formation.

structure of the superlattice; due to interference, the density of states at
the Fermi energy can be strongly enhanced or even shows no changes at all.
Furthermore, we show that by inserting the Kondo lattice layer into a
three-dimensional (3D) metal, the gap of the Kondo insulating state changes
from a full gap to a pseudo gap with quadratically vanishing spectral weight
around the Fermi energy. Due to the formation of the Kondo insulating state in
the {\it f}-electron layer, the superlattice becomes strongly anisotropic below
the Kondo temperature. We prove this by calculating the in-plane and

an axisymmetric linear instability, the vertical shear instability. Here we
show that non-axisymmetric perturbations, while eventually stabilized, can
sustain huge exponential amplifications with growth rate close to the
axisymmetric one. Transient growths are therefore to all effects genuine
instabilities. The ensuing angular momentum transport is positive. These
growths occur when the product of the radial times the vertical wavenumbers
(both evolving with time) is positive for a positive local vertical shear, or
negative for a negative local vertical shear.
  We studied, as well, the interaction of these vertical shear induced growths
with a convective instability. The asymptotic behaviour depends on the relative
strength of the axisymmetric vertical shear (s_v) and convective (s_c) growth
rates. For s_v > s_c we observed the same type of behaviour described above -
large growths occur with asymptotic stabilization. When s_c > s_v the system is
asymptotically unstable, with a growth rate which can be slightly enhanced with
respect to s_c. The most interesting feature is the sign of the angular
momentum transport. This is always positive in the phase in which the vertical
shear driven transients growths occur, even in the case s_c > s_v . Thermal

beat the so-called Heisenberg limit, i.e., for which the phase resolution
scales better than 1/n, where n is a measure of resources such as the average
photon number or the number of atomic qubits. In particular, a number of
nonlinear schemes have been proposed for which the resolution appears to scale
as 1/n^k or even exp(-n), based on optimising the quantum Cramer-Rao bound.
Such schemes include the use of entangled coherent states. However, it may be
shown that the average root mean square errors of the proposed schemes
(averaged over any prior distribution of phase shifts), cannot beat the
Heisenberg limit, and that simple estimation schemes based on entangled
coherent states cannot scale better than 1/n^{1/4}. This paradox is related to
the role of 'bias' in Cramer-Rao bounds, and is only partially ameliorated via
iterative implementations of the proposed schemes. The results are based on new
information-theoretic bounds for the average information gain and error of any
phase estimation scheme, and generalise to estimates of shifts generated by any
operator having discrete eigenvalues.

TCO=247 K (Pmmm to Pmma) associated with the onset of long range CO. At Tmin =
1.2TCO, the EPR linewidth rapidly broadens providing evidence of spin
fluctuations due to magnetic interactions between Gd3+ ions and
antiferromagnetic couplings of Co2+/Co3+ sublattices. This likely indicates
that, analogously to manganites, the long-range antiferromagnetic order in
GdBaCo2O5 sets in at TCO. Pair distribution function (PDF) analysis of
diffraction data revealed signatures of structural inhomogeneities at low
temperature. By comparing the average and local bond valences, we found that
above TCO the local structure is consistent with a fully random occupation of
Co2+ and Co3+ in a 1:1 ratio and with a complete charge ordering below TCO.
Below T = 100 K the charge localization is partially melted at the local scale,
suggesting a reentrant behavior of CO. This result is supported by the
weakening of superstructure reflections and the temperature evolution of EPR
linewidth that is consistent with paramagnetic (PM) reentrant behavior reported
in the GdBaCo2O5.5 parent compound.

  Since Aronson, Dyer, Frieze and Suen proved that the Modified Randomized

\epsilon = frac{1}{400000}) on arbitrary graphs in the mid-nineties, no further
attempts in the literature have been made to improve this theoretical ratio for
arbitrary graphs until two papers were published in FOCS 2012. Poloczek and
Szegedy also analyzed the MRG algorithm to give ratio 0.5039, while Goel and
Tripathi used experimental techniques to analyze the Ranking algorithm to give
ratio 0.56. However, we could not reproduce the experimental results of Goel

Special care is given to analyze the structural properties of the Ranking

success of our LP.
  We use continuous LP relaxation to analyze the limiting behavior as the

slackness characterizations that can handle the monotone and the boundary
constraints in continuous LP. We believe our work achieves the currently best

nearest neighbors of a set of $n$ moving points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where the
trajectory of each point is an algebraic function of at most constant degree
$s$. The approach is based on maintaining the edges of the Semi-Yao graph, a
sparse graph whose edge set includes the pairs of nearest neighbors as a
subset.
  Our kinetic data structure (KDS) for maintaining all the nearest neighbors is
deterministic. It processes $O(n^2\beta_{2s+2}^2(n)\log n)$ events with a total
cost of $O(n^2\beta_{2s+2}(n)\log^{d+1} n)$. Here, $\beta_s(n)$ is an extremely
slow-growing function. The best previous KDS for all the nearest neighbors in $
\mathbb{R}^d$ is by Agarwal, Kaplan, and Sharir (TALG 2008). It is a randomized
result. Our structure and analysis are simpler than theirs. Also, we improve
their result by a factor of $\log^d n$ in the number of events and by a $\log
n$ factor in the total cost.
  This paper generalizes and improves the 2013 work of Rahmati, King and
Whitesides (SoCG 2013) on maintaining the Semi-Yao graph in $\mathbb{R}^2$; its
new technique provides the first KDS for the Semi-Yao graph in $\mathbb{R}^d$.
Our KDS is local in the worst case, meaning that only a constant number of
events is associated with any one point at any time.
  For maintaining all the nearest neighbors, neither our KDS nor the KDS by
Agarwal~\etal~is local, and furthermore, each event in our KDS and in their KDS
is handled in polylogarithmic time in an amortized sense.
  Finally, in this paper, we also give a KDS for maintenance of all the
$(1+\epsilon)$-nearest neighbors which is local and each event can be handled
in a polylogarithmic worst-case time.

intersection of all the covering blocks containing the element. All the
neighborhoods form a new covering called a covering of neighborhoods. In the
course of studying under what condition a covering of neighborhoods is a
partition, the concept of repeat degree is proposed, with the help of which the
issue is addressed. This paper studies further the application of repeat degree
on coverings of neighborhoods. First, we investigate under what condition a
covering of neighborhoods is the reduct of the covering inducing it. As a
preparation for addressing this issue, we give a necessary and sufficient
condition for a subset of a set family to be the reduct of the set family. Then
we study under what condition two coverings induce a same relation and a same
covering of neighborhoods. Finally, we give the method of calculating the
covering according to repeat degree.

for any positive integer k, every finite set of points in R^3 can be colored
with k colors so that every translate of the negative octant containing at

first polynomial bound for the decomposability of multiple coverings by
homothetic triangles. We also investigate related decomposition problems
involving intervals appearing on a line. We prove that no algorithm can
dynamically maintain a decomposition of a multiple covering by intervals under
insertion of new intervals, even in a semi-online model, in which some coloring

symplectic quotient C^2N//SU(2). A framed polyhedron is then parametrized by N
spinors living in C^2 satisfying suitable closure constraints and defines a
usual convex polyhedron plus a phase for each face. We show that there is an
action of the unitary group U(N) on this phase space, which changes the shape
of faces and allows to map any polyhedron onto any other with the same total
area. This realizes the isomorphism of the space of framed polyhedra with the
Grassmannian space U(N)/SU(2)*U(N-2). We show how to write averages and
correlations of geometrical observables over the ensemble of polyhedra as
polynomial integrals over U(N) and we use the Itzykson-Zuber formula from
matrix models as the generating function for them. In the quantum case, a
canonical quantization of the framed polyhedron phase space leads to the
Hilbert space of SU(2) intertwiners. The individual face areas are quantized as
half-integers (spins) and the Hilbert spaces for fixed total area form
irreducible representations of U(N). We define coherent intertwiner states
peaked on classical framed polyhedra and transforming consistently under U(N)
transformations. The U(N) character formula can be considered as an extension
of the Itzykson-Zuber to the quantum level and generates the traces of all
polynomial observables over the Hilbert space of intertwiners. We finally show
that classical (convex) polygons can be described in a similar fashion trading
U(N) for O(N). We conclude with a discussion of the possible (deformation)
dynamics that one can define on the space of polygons or polyhedra. This work
is a priori useful in the context of discrete geometry but it should also be
relevant to (loop) quantum gravity in 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions when the quantum

with the three main stages in the formation and retrieval of memory in

efficient outperforming bucket sort, distribution counting sort and address

We detect line emission from all major molecular (H2, CO, H2O and OH) and many
atomic ([OI], [CII], [FeII], [SiII] and [SI]) coolants. Line emission tends to
peak at distances of 10 - 20"" from the protostellar sources, at positions of
known outflow shocks. The only exception is [CII] which likely traces a PDR
excited from the neighboring source SMM6. Excitation analysis indicates that H2
and CO originate from gas at two distinct rotational temperatures of 300 K and
1000 K, while H2O and OH emission corresponds to rotational temperatures of 100
- 200 K. The morphological and physical association between CO and H2 suggests
a common excitation mechanism which allows direct comparisons between the two
molecules. The CO/H2 abundance ratio varies from 10^-5 in the warm gas up to
10^-4 in the hotter regions. The occurrence of J-shocks is suggested by the
strong atomic/ionic (except for [CII]) emission as well as a number of line
ratio diagnostics. Both C- and J-shocks can account for the observed molecular
emission, however J-shocks are strongly advocated by the atomic emission and
provide simpler and more homogeneous solutions for CO and H2. C-shocks describe
better the emission from H2O and OH. The variations in the CO/H2 abundance
ratio for gas at different temperatures can be interpreted by their reformation
rates in dissociative J-type shocks, or the simultaneous influence of both C
and J shocks.

evolving metrics stay finite and bounded away from 0.
  Topping \cite{T:1} addresses the question with an upper bound that depends on
the $L^{(n-1)/2}$ bound of the scalar curvature, volume and a local version of
Perelman's $\nu$ invariant. Here $n$ is the dimension. His result is sharp when
Perelman's F entropy is positive. In this note, we give a direct proof that for
all compact manifolds, the diameter bound depends just on the $L^{(n-1)/2}$
bound of the scalar curvature, volume and the Sobolev constants (or positive
Yamabe constant). This bound seems directly computable in large time for some
Ricci flows. In addition, since the result in its most general form is
independent of Ricci flow, further applications may be possible.
  A generally sharp lower bound for the diameters is also given, which depends
only on the initial metric, time and $L^\infty$ bound of the scalar curvature.
These results imply that, in finite time, the Ricci flow can neither turn the
diameter to infinity nor zero, unless the scalar curvature blows up.

guarantees the non-triviality of the limit and the locality of neuronal

the distribution of action potential obeys a nonlinear

measurements from space. We acquired 117 h of Stromgren uvy data during 19
nights. Our targets comprised the Beta Cephei stars Kappa and Lambda Sco, the
eclipsing binary Mu 1 Sco, and the variable super/hypergiant Zeta 1 Sco. For
Kappa Sco, a photometric mode identification in combination with results from
the spectroscopic literature suggests a dominant (l, m) = (1, -1) Beta
Cephei-type pulsation mode of the primary star. The longer period of the star
may be a rotational variation or a g-mode pulsation. For Lambda Sco, we recover
the known dominant Beta Cephei pulsation, a longer-period variation, and
observed part of an eclipse. Lack of ultraviolet data precludes mode
identification for this star. We noticed that the spectroscopic orbital
ephemeris of the closer pair in this triple system is inconsistent with eclipse
timings and propose a refined value for the orbital period of the closer pair
of 5.95189 +/- 0.00003 d. We also argue that the components of the Lambda Sco
system are some 30% more massive than previously thought. The binary light
curve solution of Mu 1 Sco requires inclusion of the irradiation effect to
explain the u light curve, and the system could show additional low amplitude
variations on top of the orbital light changes. Zeta 1 Sco shows long-term
variability on a time scale of at least two weeks that we prefer to interpret
in terms of a variable wind or strange mode pulsations.

chicken villin headpiece (HP-36) in two different aqueous binary mixtures,
namely water-ethanol (EtOH) and water-dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO). In both the
binary mixtures, HP-36 is found to unfold (fully or partially, depending on the
mixture) under ambient conditions, that otherwise requires temperature as high
as ~600 K to denature in pure aqueous solvent. In all the cases, first step of
unfolding is found to be similar, i.e. separation of the cluster formed by
three hydrophobic (phenylalanine) residues, namely Phe-7, Phe-11 and Phe-18,
which constitute the hydrophobic core, thereby initiating melting of helix-2 of
the protein. Subsequent unfolding steps follow different paths in different
chemical environments. As both water-DMSO and water-ethanol show composition
dependent anomalies, so do the details of unfolding dynamics. With an increase
of co-solvent concentration different partially unfolded intermediates are
found to be formed in both the cases. This is reflected in a remarkable
non-monotonic composition dependence of several order parameters, including
fraction of native contacts and protein-solvent interaction energy. The
emergence of such partially unfolded states is particularly attributed to the
preferential solvation of the hydrophobic residues by the ethyl groups of
ethanol and methyl groups of DMSO. While in DMSO the protein gradually attains
a completely unfolded state at xDMSO=0.30, unfolding in water-ethanol appears
to be more complex and sensitive to solvent composition.

accurate values possible of the physical parameters of the \delta Sct star

spectra with the goal of using it to determine the mean density of the star.
First, we extracted the frequency content from the CoRoT light curve. Then, we
derived the physical parameters of HD174966 and carried a mode identification
out from the spectroscopic and photometric observations. We used this
information to look for the models fulfilling all the conditions and discussed
the inaccuracies of the method because of the rotation effects. In a final
step, we searched for patterns in the frequency set using a Fourier transform,
discussed its origin and studied the possibility of using the periodicity to
obtain information about the physical parameters of the star. A total of 185
peaks were obtained from the Fourier analysis of the CoRoT light curve, being
almost all reliable pulsating frequencies. From the spectroscopic observations,
18 oscillation modes were detected and identified, and the inclination angle
($62.5^{\circ}$$^{+7.5}_{-17.5}$) and the rotational velocity of the star (142
km/s) were estimated. From the multi-colour photometric observations, 3
frequencies were detected, which correspond to the main ones in the CoRoT light
curve. We looked for periodicities within the 185 frequencies and found a
periodic pattern ~64 \mu Hz. Using the inclination angle, the rotational
velocity and an Echelle diagram, showing a double comb outside the asymptotic
regime, we concluded that the periodicity corresponds to a large separation
structure. The periodic pattern allowed us to discriminate models from a grid,
finding that the value of the mean density is achieved with a 6% uncertainty.
So, the pattern could be used as a new observable for A-F type stars.

by a model of the Ice Ages of the Pleistocene, which postulates a hot planet in
an extremely eccentric orbit. This object has many consequences. It is rather
well defined by the requirements, that it must not be in conflict with laws of
nature, nor with empirical data. It must have sufficient mass to produce a
rapid geographic pole shift on Earth after a close flyby at the end of the
Pleistocene, and also be small enough to disintegrate at this occasion and to
evaporate during the Holocene. These requirements leave hardly any adaptable
parameters. In this situation, the agreement with further data, in particular

of detachment fronts at the contact interface that may appear well before the
onset of global sliding. This intriguing precursory activity is not accounted
for by traditional friction theories but is extremely important for friction
dominated geophysical phenomena such as earthquakes, landslides or avalanches.
Here we simulate the onset of slip of a three dimensional elastic body resting
on a surface and show that experimentally observed frictional precursors depend
in a complex non-universal way on the sample geometry and the loading
conditions. Our model satisfies Archard's law and Amontons' first and second
laws, reproducing with remarkable precision the real contact area dynamics, the
precursors' envelope dynamics prior to the transition to sliding, and the
normal and shear internal stress distributions close to the slider-substrate
interface. Moreover, it allows to assess which experimental features can be
attributed to the elastic equilibrium, and which are attributed to the
out-of-equilibrium dynamics, suggesting that precursory activity is an
intrinsically quasi-static physical process. A direct calculation of the
evolution of the Coulomb stress before and during precursors nucleation shows
large variations across the sample, which helps to explain why earthquake
forecasting methods based only on accumulated slip and Coulomb stress
monitoring are often ineffective.

electromagnetic cascades initiated by very-high-energy (VHE) {\gamma}-rays in
the intergalactic medium depend on the strength B and correlation length
{\lambda}B of intergalactic magnetic fields (IGMF). Aims. We study the
possibility of measuring both B and {\lambda}B via observations of the cascade
emission with {\gamma}-ray telescopes. Methods. For each measurement method, we
find two characteristics of the cascade signal, which are sensitive to the IGMF
B and {\lambda}B values in different combinations. For the case of IGMF
measurement using the observation of extended emission around extragalactic VHE
{\gamma}-ray sources, the two characteristics are the slope of the surface
brightness profile and the overall size of the cascade source. For the case of
IGMF measurement from the time delayed emission, these two characteristics are
the initial slope of the cascade emission light curve and the overall duration
of the cascade signal. Results. We show that measurement of the slope of the
cascade induced extended emission and/or light curve can both potentially
provide measure of the IGMF correlation length, provided it lies within the
range 10 kpc< {\lambda}B <1 Mpc. For correlation lengths outside this range,
gamma-ray observations can provide upper or lower bound on {\lambda}B. The
latter of the two methods holds great promise in the near future for providing
a measurement/constraint using measurements from present/next-generation
{\gamma}-ray-telescopes. Conclusions. Measurement of the IGMF correlation
length will provide an important constraint on its origin. In particular, it
will enable to distinguish between an IGMF of galactic wind origin from an IGMF
of cosmological origin.

characterizing precise quality of service (QoS) requirements that accurately
reflect the UEs' application usage, our proposed cell association approach
accounts for the devices' hardware type (e.g., smartphone, tablet, laptop).
This approach has the practical benefit of enabling the small cells to make
better informed cell association decisions that handle practical
device-specific QoS characteristics. We formulate the problem as a matching
game between small cell base stations (SBSs) and UEs. In this game, the SBSs
and UEs rank one another based on well-designed utility functions that capture
composite QoS requirements, extracted from the context features (i.e.,
application in use, hardware type). We show that the preferences used by the
nodes to rank one another are interdependent and influenced by the existing
network-wide matching. Due to this unique feature of the preferences, we show
that the proposed game can be classified as a many-to-one matching game with
externalities. To solve this game, we propose a distributed algorithm that
enables the players (i.e., UEs and SBSs) to self-organize into a stable
matching that guarantees the required applications' QoS. Simulation results
show that the proposed context-aware cell association scheme yields significant
gains, reaching up to 52% improvement compared to baseline context-unaware
approaches.

$L, i$ are respectively the Lie derivative and interior product along the
corresponding vector fields. The covariant derivative extends naturally along
forms of any degree and to possibly degenerate $(\ ,\ )$. In the nondegenerate
case, $\delta$ makes the exterior algebra into a BV algebra. In the invertible
case we show that ${\rm Ricci}=-{1\over 2}\Delta g$ where the Hodge Laplacian
$\Delta$ extends in a natural way to act on the metric.
  Our results come from a new way of thinking about metrics and connections as
a kind of cocycle data for central extensions of differential graded algebras
(DGAs), a theory which we introduce. We show that any cleft extension of the
exterior algebra $\Omega(M)$ on a manifold is associated to a
possibly-degenerate metric and covariant derivative. Those for which $d$ is not
deformed up to isomorphism correspond to the Levi-Civita case. We provide a
construction for such extensions both of classical DGAs and of already
non-graded-commutative DGAs, thereby constructing a class of bimodule covariant
derivatives via a kind of quantum analogue of the Koszul formula.
  We also provide a semidirect product of any differential graded algebra by
the quantum differential algebra $\Omega(t,d t)$ in one variable, to introduce
a noncommutative `time'. Composing these two constructions recovers a previous
differential quantisation of $M\times R$.

with a given Gaussian measure, the quantity S_rho(A) is maximized when A is a
half-space.
  We give a novel short proof of this fact, based on stochastic calculus.
Moreover, we prove an almost tight, two-sided, dimension-free robustness
estimate for this inequality: by introducing a new metric to measure the
distance between the set A and its corresponding half-space H (namely the
distance between the two centroids), we show that the deficit S_rho(H) -
S_rho(A) can be controlled from both below and above by essentially the same
function of the distance, up to logarithmic factors.
  As a consequence, we also establish the conjectured exponent in the
robustness estimate proven by Mossel-Neeman, which uses the total-variation
distance as a metric. In the limit rho->1, we get an improved dimension free
robustness bound for the Gaussian isoperimetric inequality. Our estimates are
also valid for a the more general version of stability where more than two

  Evaluation of Reputation Mechanisms","28 pages, 12 figures",,,,"cs.DC cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present reputation-based mechanisms for building reliable task computing
systems over the Internet. The most characteristic examples of such systems are
the volunteer computing and the crowdsourcing platforms. In both examples end
users are offering over the Internet their computing power or their human
intelligence to solve tasks either voluntarily or under payment. While the main
advantage of these systems is the inexpensive computational power provided, the
main drawback is the untrustworthy nature of the end users. Generally, this
type of systems are modeled under the ""master-worker"" setting. A ""master"" has a
set of tasks to compute and instead of computing them locally she sends these
tasks to available ""workers"" that compute and report back the task results. We
categorize these workers in three generic types: altruistic, malicious and
rational. Altruistic workers that always return the correct result, malicious
workers that always return an incorrect result, and rational workers that
decide to reply or not truthfully depending on what increases their benefit. We
design a reinforcement learning mechanism to induce a correct behavior to
rational workers, while the mechanism is complemented by four reputation
schemes that cope with malice. The goal of the mechanism is to reach a state of
eventual correctness, that is, a stable state of the system in which the master
always obtains the correct task results. Analysis of the system gives provable
guarantees under which truthful behavior can be ensured. Finally, we observe
the behavior of the mechanism through simulations that use realistic system
parameters values. Simulations not only agree with the analysis but also reveal
interesting trade-offs between various metrics and parameters. Finally, the
four reputation schemes are assessed against the tolerance to cheaters.

neutrino flux, we demonstrate that spectral shape and flavor composition can be
used to constrain or identify the source class. In order to quantify our
observations, we use a model where the target photons are produced by the
synchrotron emission of co-accelerated electrons, and we include magnetic field

observed events with energies much larger than PeV points towards sources with
strong magnetic fields, which do not exhibit a direct correlation between
highest cosmic ray and neutrino energies. While the simplest AGN models with
efficient proton acceleration plausibly describe the current data at about the
3sigma confidence level, we show that IceCube can rule out that the observed
neutrinos stem from the sources of the ultra-high energy cosmic rays with a
factor of ten increased statistics at more than 5sigma if the current

structures. Among the possible mechanisms leading to self-organization, the
oriented attachment is efficient yet not completely understood. We investigate
here the oriented attachment process of ZnO nanocrystals preformed in the gas
phase. During the deposition in high vacuum, about 60% of the particles, which
are uncapped, form larger crystals through oriented attachment. In the present
conditions of deposition, no selective direction for the oriented attachment is
noticed. To probe the driving force of the oriented attachment, and more
specifically the possible influence of the dipolar interaction between
particles, we have deposited the same nanocrystals in the presence of a
constant electric field. The expected effect was to enhance the fraction of
domains resulting from the oriented attachment due to the increased interaction
of the particle dipoles with the electric field. The multiscale analytical and
statistical analysis (TEM coupled to XRD) shows no significant influence of the
electric field on the organization of the particles. We therefore conclude that
the dipolar interaction between nanocrystals is not the prominent driving force
in the process. Consequently, we argue, in accordance with recent theoretical
and experimental investigations, that the surface reduction, possibly driven by
Coulombic interaction, may be the major mechanism for the oriented attachment
process.

a factor equal to the golden ratio. Both factors are shown to be best possible.
In fact, we obtain the above factors using packing policies that are universal

items in this order, independent of the observations made while packing. We
give efficient algorithms computing these policies. On the other hand, we show
that, for any alpha>1, the problem of deciding whether a given universal policy

the $k$-median constraint restricts the number of open facilities to at most
$k$. Previously, a constant factor was known only for the special case when all

that granulation can be analysed, which provides insights on how convective
energy transfer operates in stars. The wide range of atmospheric parameters of

the comparison of convective processes in significantly different environments.
We show that the relative intensity contrast is correlated with both the Mach

between 3 and 10 times the local pressure scale height, with a tight
correlation between the factor and the Mach number of the flow. Given that
convective giants, dwarfs, and white dwarfs cover the same range of Mach and

strongly rejected by the technique of \emph{active subtraction} in which
anti-noise is actively written onto the local oscillator beam via an optical
phase-locked-loop. In SUSHI, technical noise due to phase, amplitude, and
frequency fluctuations of the various laser fields is strongly rejected (i) for
any mean phase bias between the interferometer arms, (ii) without the use of
piezo actuated mirrors, and (iii) without signal balancing. We experimentally
demonstrate an ultra-low technical noise limited sensitivity of 51
nrad$/\sqrt{\R{Hz}}$ over a measurement bandwidth of 60 Hz to 8 kHz using a 230
$\mu$W probe, and stay within $\sim$3 dB of the standard quantum limit as probe
power is reduced by more than 5 orders of magnitude to as low as 650 pW. SUSHI
is therefore well suited to performing QND measurements for preparing spin
squeezed states and for high SNR, truly continuous observations of ground-state
Rabi flopping in cold atom ensembles.

unit axial vector along the particle symmetry axis, valid for small Stokes
number St, and for any axisymmetric particle in any steady linear viscous flow.
This reduced dynamics is analysed in two ways, both pertain to the case of a
simple shear flow. In this case inertia induces a coupling between precession
and nutation. This coupling affects the dynamics of the particle, breaks the
degeneracy of the Jeffery orbits, and creates two limiting periodic orbits. We
calculate the leading-order Floquet exponents of the limiting periodic orbits
and show analytically that prolate objects tend to a tumbling orbit, while
oblate objects tend to a log-rolling orbit, in agreement with previous
analytical and numerical results. Second, we analyse the role of the limiting
orbits when rotational noise is present. We formulate the Fokker-Planck
equation describing the orientational distribution of an axisymmetric particle,
valid for small St and general Peclet number Pe. Numerical solutions of the
Fokker-Planck equation, obtained by means of expansion in spherical harmonics,
show that stationary orientational distributions are close to the inertia-free
case when Pe St << 1, whereas they are determined by inertial effects, though
small, when Pe >> 1/St >> 1.

expense of those who died early. While this design appealed to the gambling
instinct, it is a suboptimal way to manage longevity risk during retirement.
This is why fair life annuities making constant payments -- where the insurance
company is exposed to the longevity risk -- induces greater lifetime utility.
However, tontines do not have to be designed using a winner-take-all approach
and insurance companies do not actually sell fair life annuities, partially due
to aggregate longevity risk.
  In this paper we derive the tontine structure that maximizes lifetime
utility, but doesn't expose the sponsor to any longevity risk. We examine its
sensitivity to the size of the tontine pool; individual longevity risk
aversion; and subjective health status. The optimal tontine varies with the
individual's longevity risk aversion $\gamma$ and the number of participants
$n$, which is problematic for product design. That said, we introduce a
structure called a natural tontine whose payout declines in exact proportion to
the (expected) survival probabilities, which is near-optimal for all $\gamma$
and $n$. We compare the utility of optimal tontines to the utility of loaded
life annuities under reasonable demographic and economic conditions and find
that the life annuity's advantage over tontines, is minimal.
  We also review and analyze the first-ever mortality-derivative issued by the
British government, known as King Williams's tontine of 1693. We shed light on
the preferences and beliefs of those who invested in the tontines vs. the
annuities and argue that tontines should be re-introduced and allowed to
co-exist with life annuities. Individuals would likely select a portfolio of
tontines and annuities that suit their personal preferences for consumption and
longevity risk, as they did over 320 years ago.

  Increasing Directionality",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Tensor product real-valued wavelets have been employed in many applications
such as image processing with impressive performance. Though edge singularities
are ubiquitous and play a fundamental role in two-dimensional problems, tensor
product real-valued wavelets are known to be only sub-optimal since they can
only capture edges well along the coordinate axis directions. The dual tree
complex wavelet transform (DTCWT), proposed by Kingsbury [16] and further
developed by Selesnick et al. [24], is one of the most popular and successful
enhancements of the classical tensor product real-valued wavelets. The
two-dimensional DTCWT is obtained via tensor product and offers improved
directionality with 6 directions. In this paper we shall further enhance the
performance of DTCWT for the problem of image denoising. Using framelet-based
approach and the notion of discrete affine systems, we shall propose a family
of tensor product complex tight framelets TPCTF_n for all integers n>2 with
increasing directionality, where n refers to the number of filters in the
underlying one-dimensional complex tight framelet filter bank. For dimension
two, such tensor product complex tight framelet TPCTF_n offers (n-1)(n-3)/2+4
directions when n is odd, and (n-4)(n+2)/2+6 directions when n is even. In
particular, TPCTF_4, which is different to DTCWT in both nature and design,
provides an alternative to DTCWT. Indeed, TPCTF_4 behaves quite similar to
DTCWT by offering 6 directions in dimension two, employing the tensor product
structure, and enjoying slightly less redundancy than DTCWT. When TPCTF_4 is
applied to image denoising, its performance is comparable to DTCWT. Moreover,
better results on image denoising can be obtained by using TPCTF_6. Moreover,
TPCTF_n allows us to further improve DTCWT by using TPCTF_n as the first stage
filter bank in DTCWT.

magnetic field in a volume. This quantity is believed to play a key role in
solar activity due to its conservation property. Helicity is continuously
injected into the corona during the evolution of active regions (ARs). To
better understand and quantify the role of magnetic helicity in solar activity,
the distribution of magnetic helicity flux in ARs needs to be studied. The
helicity distribution can be computed from the temporal evolution of
photospheric magnetograms of ARs such as the ones provided by SDO/HMI and
Hinode/SOT. Most recent analyses of photospheric helicity flux derive an
helicity flux density proxy based on the relative rotation rate of photospheric
magnetic footpoints. Although this proxy allows a good estimate of the
photospheric helicity flux, it is still not a true helicity flux density
because it does not take into account the connectivity of the magnetic field
lines. For the first time, we implement a helicity density which takes into
account such connectivity. In order to use it for future observational studies,
we test the method and its precision on several types of models involving
different patterns of helicity injection. We also test it on more complex
configurations - from magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations - containing
quasi-separatrix layers. We demonstrate that this connectivity-based helicity
flux density proxy is the best to map the true distribution of photospheric
helicity injection.

neutrino sources from even a single detector. We present the most precise
background estimates to date, all handled in full three dimensions, as
functions of depth and geographical location. For the present calculations, we
consider a hypothetical 138 kiloton detector which can be transported to an
ocean site and deployed to an operational depth. We present a Bayesian
estimation framework to incorporate any a priori knowledge of the reactor that
we are trying to detect, as well as the estimated uncertainty in the background
and the oscillation parameters. Most importantly, we fully employ the knowledge
of the reactor spectrum and the distance-dependent effects of neutrino
oscillations on such spectra. The latter, in particular, makes possible
determination of range from one location, given adequate signal statistics.
Further, we explore the rich potential of improving detection with even modest
improvements in individual neutrino direction determination. We conclude that a
300 MWth reactor can indeed be geolocated, and its operating power estimated
with one or two detectors in the hundred kiloton class at ranges out to a few
hundred kilometers. We note that such detectors would have natural and
non-interfering utility for scientific studies of geo-neutrinos, neutrino
oscillations, and astrophysical neutrinos. This motivates the development of
cost effective methods of constructing and deploying such next generation
detectors.

inquires into the concavity of the map from the integers N>1 into the minimal
average standardized Riesz pair-energies v_s(N) of the N-point configurations

increasing for each real s, and for s<2 also bounded above, hence ""overall
concave."" It is (easily) proved that v_{-2}(N) is even locally strictly
concave, and that so is v_s(2n) for s<-2. By analyzing computer-experimental
data of putatively minimal average Riesz pair-energies v_s^x(N) for s in
{-1,0,1,2,3} and N in {2,...,200}, it is found that {v}_{-1}^x(N) is locally
strictly concave, while v_s^x(N) is not always locally strictly concave for s

White paper for Community Summer Study",,,,"gr-qc quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  New quantum degrees of freedom of space-time, originating at the Planck
scale, could create a coherent indeterminacy and noise in the transverse
position of massive bodies on macroscopic scales. An experiment is under
development at Fermilab designed to detect or rule out a transverse position
noise with Planck spectral density, using correlated signals from an adjacent
pair of Michelson interferometers. A detection would open an experimental
window on quantum space-time.

  Relativity","MPhil Thesis",,,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The positivity of the Bondi mass has been proven in 4 dimensions, but in
higher dimensions the issue remains open. The formalism of the present paper
has been developed to investigate this and is well suited to the higher
dimensional case. At null infinity, we make asymptotic expansions of the metric
components in conformal Gaussian null coordinates, and use the vacuum Einstein
equations to solve for the expansion coefficients. We find simple coordinate
formulae for the Bondi mass, news and flux in terms of the expansion
coefficients of the metric components. We also make expansions of the generator
of an asymptotic symmetry and obtain expressions for its expansion coefficients
in terms of those of the metric components. We make a spinorial asymptotic
expansion of a solution to the Dirac equation in the four dimensional case, and
use it to give a clean proof that the Bondi mass is positive in four
dimensions. The generalisation to higher dimensions has been investigated, but
not yet resolved: indeed, the spinor mass appears to be divergent in the higher
dimensional case, because of terms which appear to be singular in the limit at
infinity. Such apparently singular terms are common in many of our
calculations, but can generally be shown to be zero before the limit is taken.
However, it is not yet clear this can be done in the case of the spinor mass in
higher dimensions, so further investigation is required.

detection of breast cancer, one of the most deadly cancer for women. The benign
of mammogram has different texture from malignant. There are fifty mammogram
images used in this work which are divided for training and testing. Therefore,
the selection of the right texture to determine the level of accuracy of CAD
system is important. The first and second order statistics are the texture
feature extraction methods which can be used on a mammogram. This work
classifies texture descriptor into nine groups where the extraction of features
is classified using backpropagation learning with two types of multi-layer
perceptron (MLP). The best texture descriptor as selected when the value of
regression 1 appears in both the MLP-1 and the MLP-2 with the number of epoches
less than 1000. The results of testing show that the best selected texture
descriptor is the second order (combination) using all direction (0, 45, 90 and
135) that have twenty four descriptors.

various phenomena such as biological and chemical reactions, radioactive decay,
photodiode current leakage and germanium semiconductor noise, and attributed
the scatter to cosmophysical factors. While Shnoll didn't pinpoint the nature
of the cosmophysical factors the Process Physics model of reality leads to a
description of space, which is dynamic and fractal and exhibits reverberation
effects, and which offers an explanation for the scattering anomaly. The work
presented here shows a new way of generating the effects Shnoll discovered,
through studying the phase difference of RF EM waves travelling through a dual
coaxial cable Gravitational Wave Detector experiment.

characteristics of a DNA sequence as an image, (ii) computes distances between

sequence is a point in a common Euclidean space. In the resulting ""Molecular
Distance Map"" each point signifies a DNA sequence, and the geometric distance
between any two points reflects the degree of relatedness between the
corresponding sequences and species.
  Molecular Distance Maps present compelling visual representations of
relationships between species and could be used for taxonomic clarifications,
for species identification, and for studies of evolutionary history. One of the
advantages of this method is its general applicability since, as sequence
alignment is not required, the DNA sequences chosen for comparison can be
completely different regions in different genomes. In fact, this method can be
used to compare any two DNA sequences. For example, in our dataset of 3,176
mitochondrial DNA sequences, it correctly finds the mtDNA sequences most
closely related to that of the anatomically modern human (the Neanderthal, the
Denisovan, and the chimp), and it finds that the sequence most different from
it belongs to a cucumber. Furthermore, our method can be used to compare real
sequences to artificial, computer-generated, DNA sequences. For example, it is
used to determine that the distances between a Homo sapiens sapiens mtDNA and
artificial sequences of the same length and same trinucleotide frequencies can
be larger than the distance between the same human mtDNA and the mtDNA of a
fruit-fly.
  We demonstrate this method's promising potential for taxonomical
clarifications by applying it to a diverse variety of cases that have been
historically controversial, such as the genus Polypterus, the family Tarsiidae,

addition to adding the edge connecting the new point to the previous ones), and
such that the tree's cost is only a constant times the optimal cost.

Coleman-Weinberg mechanism operational in a hidden sector, and then transmitted
to the Standard Model through the Higgs portal. The smallness of the generated

generations of right-handed neutrinos. Their GeV-scale Majorana masses are
induced by the Coleman-Weinberg field and lead to the generation of active

\emph{et al.} (J. Chem. Phys. \textbf{137}, 164102 (2012)), in which the terms
in the expansion are obtained from calculations on monomers, dimers, etc. acted
on by an approximate representation of the embedding field due to all other
molecules in the system, this field being a sum of Coulomb and
exchange-repulsion fields. Our strategy is to separate the total energy of the
system into Hartree-Fock and correlation parts, using the EMBE only for the
correlation energy, with the Hartree-Fock energy calculated using standard
molecular quantum chemistry for clusters and plane-wave methods for crystals.
Our tests on a range of different water clusters up to the 16-mer show that for
the second-order M\o{}ller-Plesset (MP2) method the EMBE truncated at 2-body
level reproduces to better than 0.1 m$E_{\rm h}$/monomer the correlation energy
from standard methods. The use of EMBE for computing coupled-cluster energies
of clusters is also discussed. For the ice structures Ih, II and VIII, we find
that MP2 energies near the complete basis-set limit reproduce very well the
experimental values of the absolute and relative binding energies, but that the
use of coupled-cluster methods for many-body correlation (non-additive
dispersion) is essential for a full description. Possible future applications

trapping in giant vortices, excited via Rossby wave instability (RWI) at
planetary gap edges. Due to the drag force, dust trapped in vortices will
accumulate in the center, and diffusion is needed to maintain a steady state
over the lifetime of the disk. While previous work derived semi-analytical
models of the process, in this paper we provide analytical steady-state
solutions. Exact solutions exist for certain vortex models. The solution is
determined by the vortex rotation profile, the gas scale height, the vortex
aspect ratio, and the ratio of dust diffusion to gas-dust friction. In
principle, all these quantities can be derived from observations, which would
give validation of the model, also giving constrains on the strength of the
turbulence inside the vortex core. Based on our solution, we derive quantities
such as the gas-dust contrast, the trapped dust mass, and the dust contrast at
the same orbital location. We apply our model to the recently imaged Oph IRS 48
system, finding values within the range of the observational uncertainties.

onset of superconductivity by a suppression of the spectral weight near the
Fermi energy, reminiscent of the pseudogap state in the cuprates. By measuring
the response of superconductivity to various perturbations, through both

the stochastic heating rate $Q_{\perp \rm stoch}$ using the measured value of
$\delta B_{\rm p}$ and a previously published analytical formula for $Q_{\perp

1.5 and 1.3 for the MSSM and NMSSM, respectively. So, the Higgs pair production

  Environment",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we study the multicast completion and decoding delay
minimization problems of instantly decodable network coding (IDNC) in the case
of lossy feedback. In such environments, the sender falls into uncertainties
about packet reception at the different receivers, which forces it to perform
partially blind selections of packet combinations in subsequent transmissions.
To determine efficient partially blind policies that handle the completion and
decoding delays of IDNC in such environment, we first extend the perfect
feedback formulation in [2], [3] to the lossy feedback environment, by
incorporating the uncertainties resulting from unheard feedback events in these
formulations. For the completion delay problem, we use this formulation to
identify the maximum likelihood state of the network in events of unheard
feedback, and employ it to design a partially blind graph update extension to
the multicast IDNC algorithm in [3]. For the decoding delay problem, we derive
an expression for the expected decoding delay increment for any arbitrary
transmission. This expression is then used to derive the optimal policy to
reduce the decoding delay in such lossy feedback environment. Results show that
our proposed solution both outperforms other approaches and achieves a
tolerable degradation even at relatively high feedback loss rates.

IRAS 18460-0151. The H_2O maser spectrum has a very wide line-of-sight velocity
range (~310 km/s) and consists of three groups of emission features at the
blue-shifted (-68 km/s <~ V_LSR <~ -17 km/s) and red-shifted (V_LSR ~= 240
km/s) edges as well as around the systemic velocity (112 km/s <~ V_LSR <~ 133
km/s). The first two H_2O spectral components exhibit a highly-collimated
high-velocity bipolar jet on the sky, with an angular separation of ~120
milliarcseconds (mas) (240 AU in linear length) and a three-dimensional flow
velocity of ~160 km/s. The flow dynamical age is estimated to be only ~6 yr (at
the time of the observation epochs of 2006--2007). Interestingly, the systemic
velocity component clearly exhibits a spherically-expanding outflow with a
radius of ~36 AU and a flow velocity of ~9 km/s. On the other hand, the OH
maser spectrum shows double peaks with a velocity separation of ~25 km/s
(V_LSR=$111--116 and 138--141 km/s), as typically seen in circumstellar
envelopes of OH/IR stars. The angular offset between the velocity-integrated
brightness peaks of the two high-velocity H_2O components is ~25 mas (50 AU).
The offset direction and the alignment of the red-shifted maser spots are
roughly perpendicular to the axis of the H_2O maser flow. High-accuracy
astrometry for the H_2O and OH masers demonstrates that the collimated fast jet
and the slowly expanding outflow originate from a single or multiple sources
which are located within 15 mas (30 AU). On the other hand, the estimated
systemic velocity of the collimated jet (V_sys ~87--113 km/s) has a large
uncertainty. This makes it difficult to provide strong constraints on models of
the central stellar system of IRAS 18460-0151.

Schulman","The Network Improvement Problem for Equilibrium Routing","27 pages (including abstract), 3 figures",,,,"cs.GT cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In routing games, agents pick their routes through a network to minimize
their own delay. A primary concern for the network designer in routing games is
the average agent delay at equilibrium. A number of methods to control this
average delay have received substantial attention, including network tolls,
Stackelberg routing, and edge removal.
  A related approach with arguably greater practical relevance is that of
making investments in improvements to the edges of the network, so that, for a
given investment budget, the average delay at equilibrium in the improved
network is minimized. This problem has received considerable attention in the
literature on transportation research and a number of different algorithms have
been studied. To our knowledge, none of this work gives guarantees on the
output quality of any polynomial-time algorithm. We study a model for this
problem introduced in transportation research literature, and present both
hardness results and algorithms that obtain nearly optimal performance
guarantees.
  - We first show that a simple algorithm obtains good approximation guarantees
for the problem. Despite its simplicity, we show that for affine delays the
approximation ratio of 4/3 obtained by the algorithm cannot be improved.
  - To obtain better results, we then consider restricted topologies. For
graphs consisting of parallel paths with affine delay functions we give an
optimal algorithm. However, for graphs that consist of a series of parallel
links, we show the problem is weakly NP-hard.
  - Finally, we consider the problem in series-parallel graphs, and give an
FPTAS for this case.
  Our work thus formalizes the intuition held by transportation researchers
that the network improvement problem is hard, and presents topology-dependent
algorithms that have provably tight approximation guarantees.

conditional statements. There are four principal types: subjunctive, material,
existential, and feasibility. Two further types of conditionals are defined
using the propositional calculus and Boole's mathematical logic:
truth-functional and Boolean feasibility (which turn out to be special cases of
probabilistic conditionals). Each probabilistic conditional is quantified by a
fractional parameter between zero and one that says whether it is purely
affirmative, purely negative, or intermediate in its sense. Conditionals can be
specialized further by their content to express factuality and
counterfactuality, and revised or reformulated to account for exceptions and
confounding factors. The various conditionals have distinct mathematical
representations: through intermediate probability expressions and logical
formulas, each conditional is eventually translated into a set of polynomial
equations and inequalities (with real coefficients). The polynomial systems
from different types of conditionals exhibit different patterns of behavior,
concerning for example opposing conditionals or false antecedents. Interesting
results can be computed from the relevant polynomial systems using well-known
methods from algebra and computer science. Among other benefits, the proposed
framework of analysis offers paraconsistent procedures for logical deduction
that produce such familiar results as modus ponens, transitivity, disjunction
introduction, and disjunctive syllogism; all while avoiding any explosion of
consequences from inconsistent premises. Several example problems from Goodman
and Adams are analyzed. A new perspective called polylogicism is presented:
mathematical logic that respects the diversity among conditionals in particular

dictionary, and obtains promising performance in practical computer vision
applications, especially for signal restoration tasks such as image denoising
and image inpainting. In recent years, many discriminative sparse coding
algorithms have been developed for classification problems, but they cannot
naturally handle visual data represented by multiview features. In addition,
existing sparse coding algorithms use graph Laplacian to model the local
geometry of the data distribution. It has been identified that Laplacian
regularization biases the solution towards a constant function which possibly
leads to poor extrapolating power. In this paper, we present multiview Hessian
discriminative sparse coding (mHDSC) which seamlessly integrates Hessian
regularization with discriminative sparse coding for multiview learning
problems. In particular, mHDSC exploits Hessian regularization to steer the
solution which varies smoothly along geodesics in the manifold, and treats the
label information as an additional view of feature for incorporating the
discriminative power for image annotation. We conduct extensive experiments on
PASCAL VOC'07 dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of mHDSC for image
annotation.

simulations in $4\pi$ geometry of He-shell flash convection with proton-rich
fuel entrainment at the upper boundary. This work is motivated by the
insufficiently understood observed consequences of the H-ingestion flash in
post-AGB stars (Sakurai's object) and metal-poor AGB stars. Our investigation
is focused on the entrainment process at the top convection boundary and on the
subsequent advection of H-rich material into deeper layers, and we therefore
ignore the burning of the proton-rich fuel in this study. We find that, for our
deep convection zone, coherent convective motions of near global scale appear
to dominate the flow. At the top boundary convective shear flows are stable
against Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. However, such shear instabilities are
induced by the boundary-layer separation in large-scale, opposing flows. This
links the global nature of thick shell convection with the entrainment process.
We establish the quantitative dependence of the entrainment rate on grid
resolution. With our numerical technique simulations with $1024^3$ cells or
more are required to reach a numerical fidelity appropriate for this problem.
However, only the result from the $1536^3$ simulation provides a clear
indication that we approach convergence with regard to the entrainment rate.
Our results demonstrate that our method, which is described in detail, can
provide quantitative results related to entrainment and convective boundary
mixing in deep stellar interior environments with veryvstiff convective
boundaries. For the representative case we study in detail, we find an
entrainment rate of $4.38 \pm 1.48 \times 10^{-13}M_\odot \mathrm{/s}$.

indeed a form of efficient learning by showing that it can be used to obtain
close-to-optimal bounds on the time and queries required to approximately
correctly solve a constrained version (k=7, \eta=1/5) of a recognizable

where n is the total number of attributes. Our proof relies on an accessible
symmetry argument and the use of statistical hypothesis testing to reject a

of our knowledge, the first relatively rigorous identification of efficient
computational learning in an evolutionary algorithm on a non-trivial learning

$L$) have been studied in a viscous flow (velocity $U$) between parallel
vertical walls of horizontal width $W$ at a distance $H$: the influence of the
confinement parameters $D/H$ and $L/W$ has been investigated. As $D/H$
increases, there is a transition from stable flow to oscillations transverse to
the walls and then to a fluttering motion with oscillations of the angle of the
axis with respect to the horizontal. The two types of oscillations may be
superimposed in the transition domain. The frequency $f$ of the transverse
oscillations is independent of the lateral confinement $L/W$ in the range:
0.055 \le L/W \le 0.94$ for a given cylinder velocity $V_{cx}$ and increases
only weakly with $V_{cx}$. These results are accounted for by assuming a 2D
local flow over the cylinder with a characteristic velocity independent of
$L/W$ for a given $V_{cx}$ value. The experimental values of $f$ are also
independent of the transverse confinement $D/H$. The frequency $f_f$ of the
fluttering motion is significantly lower than $f$: $f_f$ is also nearly
independent of the cylinder diameter and of the flow velocity but decreases
significantly as $L/W$ increases. The fluttering instability is then rather a
3D phenomenon involving the full length of the cylinder and the clearance
between its ends and the side walls.

obtained jointly with the selection of radio parameters, e.g., transmit power

mobile handset, under a latency constraint taking into account transmit time
and execution time. We consider both single and multi-channel transmission
strategies and we prove that a globally optimal solution can be achieved in
both cases. Finally, we propose a suboptimal strategy aimed at solving a
relaxed version of the original problem in order to tradeoff complexity and
performance of the proposed framework. Finally, several numerical results
illustrate under what conditions in terms of call graph topology, communication
strategy, and computation parameters, the proposed offloading strategy provides
large performance gains.

These estimates are used in another paper where we prove a global existence

their preferences in the form of graded judgments, such as ratings. If accurate
top-N recommendation lists are to be produced for such graded relevance
domains, it is critical to generate a ranked list of recommended items directly
rather than predicting ratings. Current techniques choose one of two
sub-optimal approaches: either they optimize for a binary metric such as
Average Precision, which discards information on relevance grades, or they
optimize for Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), which ignores the
dependence of an item's contribution on the relevance of more highly ranked
items.
  In this paper, we address the shortcomings of existing approaches by
proposing the Graded Average Precision factor model (GAPfm), a latent factor
model that is particularly suited to the problem of top-N recommendation in
domains with graded relevance data. The model optimizes for Graded Average
Precision, a metric that has been proposed recently for assessing the quality
of ranked results list for graded relevance. GAPfm learns a latent factor model
by directly optimizing a smoothed approximation of GAP. GAPfm's advantages are
twofold: it maintains full information about graded relevance and also
addresses the limitations of models that optimize NDCG. Experimental results
show that GAPfm achieves substantial improvements on the top-N recommendation
task, compared to several state-of-the-art approaches. In order to ensure that
GAPfm is able to scale to very large data sets, we propose a fast learning
algorithm that uses an adaptive item selection strategy. A final experiment
shows that GAPfm is useful not only for generating recommendation lists, but
also for ranking a given list of rated items.

geometrical variables. Comparison of the period distribution for the entire
sample of RRLs with similar distributions in nearby dSphs and in the Large
Magellanic Cloud indicates that the old stellar populations in these systems
share similar properties. This finding is also supported by the RRL
distribution in the Bailey diagram. On the other hand, the period distribution
and the Bailey diagram of ACs display significant differences among the above
stellar systems. This evidence suggests that the properties of intermediate-age
stellar populations might be affected both by environmental effects and
structural parameters. We use the BV Period--Wesenheit (PW) relation of RRLs
together with evolutionary prescriptions and find a true distance modulus of
20.09+/-0.07(intrinsic)+/-0.1(statistical) mag that agrees quite well with
similar estimates available in the literature. We identified four peculiar
variables. Taking into account their position in the Bailey diagram and in the

(V158, V182) might be peculiar RRLs. In particular, the variable V158 has a
period and a V-band amplitude very similar to the low-mass RRL

strong-field laser-atom/molecule interactions. Due to its quantum nature, the
interaction is governed by the phase of the released electron wave-packets.
Thus, detailed mapping of the electron wave-packet interferences provides
essential insight into the physics underlying the interaction. A process which
is providing access to the intricacies of the interaction is the generation of
high order harmonics of the laser frequency. The phase-amplitude distribution
of the emitted extreme-ultraviolet (EUV), carries the complete information
about the harmonic generation process and vice-versa. Thus, the visualization
of the EUV-spatial-amplitude-distribution, as it results from interfering
electron wave-packet contributions, is of crucial importance. Restrictions to
this accomplishment are due to the spatially integrating measurement approaches
applied so far, that average out the phase effects in the generation process.
In this work, we demonstrate a method which overcomes this obstacle. An
EUV-spatial-amplitude-distribution-image is induced from the imprint on the
measured spatial distribution of ions, produced through EUV-photon ionization
of atoms. Interference extremes in the image carry phase information about the
interfering electron wave-packets. The present approach provides detailed
insight on the strong-field laser-atom interaction mechanism, while
establishing the era of phase selective interaction studies. Furthermore, it
paves the way for substantial enhancement of the spectral and temporal
precision of measurements by in-situ controlling the phase distribution of the
emitted radiation and/or spatially selecting the EUV-radiation-atom interaction
products.

distributed storage systems) have reignited the interest of the scientific and
engineering community towards the design of lossless data compressors which
achieve effective compression ratio and very efficient decompression speed.
Lempel-Ziv's LZ77 algorithm is the de facto choice in this scenario because of
its decompression speed and its flexibility in trading decompression speed
versus compressed-space efficiency. Each of the existing implementations offers
a trade-off between space occupancy and decompression speed, so software
engineers have to content themselves by picking the one which comes closer to
the requirements of the application in their hands. Starting from these
premises, and for the first time in the literature, we address in this paper
the problem of trading optimally, and in a principled way, the consumption of
these two resources by introducing the Bicriteria LZ77-Parsing problem, which
formalizes in a principled way what data-compressors have traditionally
approached by means of heuristics. The goal is to determine an LZ77 parsing
which minimizes the space occupancy in bits of the compressed file, provided
that the decompression time is bounded by a fixed amount (or vice-versa). This
way, the software engineer can set its space (or time) requirements and then
derive the LZ77 parsing which optimizes the decompression speed (or the space
occupancy, respectively). We solve this problem efficiently in O(n log^2 n)
time and optimal linear space within a small, additive approximation, by
proving and deploying some specific structural properties of the weighted graph
derived from the possible LZ77-parsings of the input file. The preliminary set
of experiments shows that our novel proposal dominates all the highly
engineered competitors, hence offering a win-win situation in theory&practice.

in a metallic spherical shell. Motions in the fluid are driven by differential
rotation of the outer metallic shell, which we refer to as ""the wall"". The two
hemispheres of the wall are held in counter-rotation, producing a steady,
axisymmetric interior flow consisting of differential rotation and a two-cell
meridional circulation with radial inflow in the equatorial plane. From
previous studies, this type of flow is known to maintain a stationary
equatorial dipole by dynamo action if the magnetic Reynolds number is larger
than about 300 and if the outer boundary is electrically insulating. We vary
independently the thickness, electrical conductivity, and magnetic permeability
of the wall to determine their effect on the dynamo action. The main results
are: (a) Increasing the conductivity of the wall hinders the dynamo by allowing
eddy currents within the wall, which are induced by the relative motion of the
equatorial dipole field and the wall. This processes can be viewed as a skin
effect or, equivalently, as the tearing apart of the dipole by the differential
rotation of the wall, to which the field lines are anchored by high
conductivity. (b) Increasing the magnetic permeability of the wall favors
dynamo action by constraining the magnetic field lines in the fluid to be
normal to the wall, thereby decoupling the fluid from any induction in the
wall. (c) Decreasing the wall thickness limits the amplitude of the eddy
currents, and is therefore favorable for dynamo action, provided that the wall
is thinner than the skin depth. We explicitly demonstrate these effects of the
wall properties on the dynamo field by deriving an effective boundary condition
in the limit of vanishing wall thickness.

has disclosed the possibility of realising tasks beyond classical limits,
creating the new field of quantum technologies [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].
Among them, quantum metrology and imaging aim to improve the sensitivity and/or
resolution of measurements exploiting non-classical features such as squeezing
and quantum correlations (entanglement and discordant states) [10, 11, 12, 13,
14]. Nevertheless, in most of the realistic scenarios losses and noise are
known to nullify the advantage of adopting quantum strategies [15]. In this
paper we describe in detail the first experimental realization of quantum
illumination protocol aimed to target detection in a noisy environment, that
preserves a strong advantage over the classical counterparts even in presence
of large amount of noise and losses. The experiment, inspired by the
theoretical ideas elaborated in [16, 17, 18, 19] (see also [20, 21]), has been
performed exploiting only photon number correlations in twin beams. Thus, for
its simplicity it can find widespread use. Even more important by challenging
the common believe that real application of quantum technologies is limited by

system is coherently driven with a pulse whose detuning is made up of two
parts: a time-dependent part (chirp) of hyperbolic-tangent shape and a static
part with real and imaginary terms. This gives us a wide range of possibilities
to arbitrarily select the interaction terms. We considered two versions which
led to decaying Demkov-Kunike (DK) models; the version in which the Rabi
frequency (interaction) is a time-dependent hyperbolic-secant function (called
decaying DK1 model) and the case when it is constant in time and never turns
off (decaying DK2 model). Our analytical solutions account for all possible
initial moments instead of only $t_{0}=0$ or $t_{0}=-\infty$ as for
non-decaying models and may be useful for experiments on level crossings. Two
complementary limits of the pulse detuning are considered and explored: the
limit of fast (i) and slow rise (ii). In the case (i), the coupling between
level positions in the first DK model collapses while the second DK model
reduces to a Rabi model (constant Hamiltonian), in the case (ii), both DK
models reduce to the LZ model. In both cases (i) and (ii), analytical
approximated solutions which conveniently approach the exact solutions are
derived.

probability distribution for the local non-Gaussianity parameter

introduce allows us to dispense with numerically expensive sampling techniques.
We use a novel posterior validation method (DIP test) in cosmology to test the
precision of our method. It transfers inaccuracies of the calculated posterior
into deviations from a uniform distribution for a specially constructed test
quantity. For this procedure we study toy cases that use one- and
two-dimensional flat skies, as well as the full spherical sky. We find that we
are able to calculate the posterior precisely under a flat-sky approximation,
albeit not in the spherical case. We argue that this is most likely due to an
insufficient precision of the used numerical implementation of the spherical
harmonic transform, which might affect other non-Gaussianity estimators as
well. Furthermore, we present how a nonlinear reconstruction of the primordial
gravitational potential on the full spherical sky can be obtained in principle.
Using the flat-sky approximation, we find deviations for the posterior of
$f_{\text{nl}}$ from a Gaussian shape that become more significant for larger
values of the underlying true $f_{\text{nl}}$. We also perform a comparison to
the well-known estimator of Komatsu et al. [Astrophys. J. 634, 14 (2005)] and
finally derive the posterior for the local non-Gaussianity parameter

universe is ignited in consequence of the B-L phase transition, which
represents the cosmological realization of the spontaneous breaking of the
Abelian gauge symmetry associated with B-L, the difference between baryon
number B and lepton number L. Prior to the B-L phase transition, the universe
experiences a stage of hybrid inflation. Towards the end of inflation, the
false vacuum of unbroken B-L decays, which entails tachyonic preheating as well
as the production of cosmic strings. The dynamics of the B-L breaking Higgs
field and the B-L gauge degrees of freedom, in combination with thermal
processes, generate an abundance of heavy (s)neutrinos. These (s)neutrinos
decay into radiation, thereby reheating the universe, generating the baryon
asymmetry of the universe and setting the stage for the thermal production of
gravitinos. We study the B-L phase transition in the full supersymmetric
Abelian Higgs model, for which we derive and discuss the Lagrangian in
arbitrary and unitary gauge. As for the subsequent reheating process, we
formulate the complete set of Boltzmann equations, the solutions of which
enable us to give a detailed and time-resolved description of reheating.
Assuming the gravitino to be the lightest superparticle (LSP), the requirement
of consistency between hybrid inflation, leptogenesis and gravitino dark matter
implies relations between neutrino and superparticle masses, in particular a
lower bound on the gravitino mass of 10 GeV. Similarly, in the case of very
heavy gravitinos, the nonthermal production of pure wino or higgsino LSPs in
heavy gravitino decays can account for the observed amount of dark matter,
while simultaneously fulfilling the constraints imposed by primordial
nucleosynthesis and leptogenesis.

polarization sensitivity by the selection of a fraction of the events in a

detector made with a succession of converter slabs and tracker foils, the
dependance of the dilution is found to be different from that predicted
assuming a given (the most probable) value of the pair opening angle. The
limitations of a slab detector are avoided by the use of an active target, in
which conversion and tracking are performed by the same device, in which case

in post-LHC physics scenarios. There have been great expectations of rich new
physics in the 0.1-1 TeV mass region: the Higgs boson (one or several),
supersymmetry, or perhaps new particles from the dark-matter family. It has
been the general consensus that the best machine for the detailed study of new
physics to be discovered at the LHC would be an energy-frontier linear e+e-
collider. Physicists held their breath waiting for the results from the LHC. In
summer 2012, two LHC detectors, ATLAS and CMS, announced the discovery of a
Higgs boson with the mass of 126 GeV and (still) nothing else. The absence of
new physics in the region below 1 TeV has changed the post-LHC collider R&D
priorities and triggered a zoo of project proposals for the precision study of
the 126 GeV Higgs boson, possibly with further upgrades to higher energies.

  Methods. We compared the bulk of radio-continuum maps, radio-recombination
line profiles, and the H30alpha centroid map published to date with the
predictions of our non-LTE 3D radiative transfer model, MORELI (MOdel for
REcombination LInes), which we describe here in detail.
  Results. Our non-LTE 3D radiative transfer model provides new evidence that
the UC-HII region of MWC349A is composed of an ionized circumstellar disk
rotating in Keplerian fashion around a star of 38 solar mass, and an ionized
outflow expanding with a terminal velocity of 60 km/s and rotating in the same
sense as the disk. The model shows that while maser amplification is the
dominant process involved for Hn\alpha radio-recombination line (RRL) emission
with quantum numbers n<41, stimulated emission is relevant for the emission of
RRLs with n>41 up at least the H76alpha line.
  Conclusions. For the first time, we present a model of MWC349A which
satisfactorily explains the vast amount of reported observational data for a
very wide range of frequencies and angular resolutions.

infrared modification of Einstein equations. We find that the model generates a
dynamical dark energy that can account for the presently observed value of
$\Omega_{\rm DE}$, without introducing a cosmological constant. Tuning a free
mass parameter $m$ to a value $m\simeq 0.67 H_0$ we reproduce the observed
value $\Omega_{\rm DE}\simeq 0.68$. This leaves us with no free parameter and
we then get a pure prediction for the EOS parameter of dark energy. Writing
$w_{\rm DE}(a)=w_0+(1-a) w_a$, we find $w_0\simeq-1.04$ and $w_a\simeq -0.02$,
consistent with the Planck data, and on the phantom side. We also argue that
non-local equations of the type that we propose must be understood as purely
classical effective equations, such as those derived in semiclassical gravity
for the in-in matrix elements of the metric. As such, any apparent ghost
instability in such equations only affects the classical dynamics, but there is
no propagating degree of freedom associated to the ghost, and no issue of
ghost-induced quantum vacuum decay.

compute the Lyapunov exponent by taking into account the fact that the
particles follow the minima of the potential function corresponding to the

dimensions the sign of the maximal Lyapunov exponent \lambda_1 may change,
depending upon the degree of compressibility of the flow and the Kubo number.

system of linear equations is of main interest. This scheme is commonly
proposed to be applied to signal acquisition. In most cases, the signals are
not sparse themselves, and therefore, they need to be sparsely represented with
the help of a so-called dictionary being specific to the corresponding signal
family. The dictionaries cannot be used for optimization of the resulting
under-determined system because they are fixed by the given signal family.
However, the measurement matrix is available for optimization and can be
adapted to the dictionary. Multiple properties of the resulting linear system
have been proposed which can be used as objective functions for optimization.
This paper discusses two of them which are both related to the coherence of
vectors. One property aims for having incoherent measurements, while the other
aims for insuring the successful reconstruction. In the following, the
influences of both criteria are compared with different reconstruction
approaches.

radio-loud quasars of core-dominated (CDQs) and lobe-dominated (LDQs) types and
normal QSOs. The MgII associated absorption systems having a velocity offset v
< 5000km/s from the systemic velocity of the background quasar were also
excluded. Existing spectroscopic data for redshift-matched sightlines of 3975
CDQs and 1583 LDQs, covering a emission redshift range 0.39-4.87, were analysed
and 864 strong MgII absorbers were found, covering the redshift range
0.45-2.17. The conclusions reached using this well-defined large dataset of
strong MgII absorbers are: (i) The number density, dN/dz, towards CDQs shows a
small, marginally significant excess over the estimate available for QSOs; (ii)
In the redshift space, this difference is reflected in terms of a 1.6sigma
excess of dN/dz over the QSOs, within the narrow redshift interval 1.2-1.8;
(iii) The dN/dbeta distribution (with beta=v/c) for CDQs shows a significant
excess over the distribution found for a redshift and luminosity matched sample
of QSOs, at beta in the range 0.05-0.1. This leads us to infer that a
significant fraction of strong MgII absorption systems seen in this offset
velocity range are probably associated with the CDQs and might be accelerated
into the line of sight by their powerful jets and/or due to the accretion-disk
outflows close to our direction. Support to this scenario comes from a
consistency check in which we only consider the spectral range corresponding to
beta > 0.2. The computed redshift distribution for strong MgII absorbers
towards CDQs now shows excellent agreement with that known for QSOs, as indeed
is expected for purely intervening absorption systems. Thus, it appears that
for CDQs the associated strong MgII absorbers can be seen at much larger
velocities relative to the nucleus than the commonly adopted upper limit of
5000km/s.

The DIB spectrum of DY Cen (Garcia-Hernandez et al. 2012a) is remarkably
different from that in fullerene PNe (Garcia-Hernandez & Diaz-Luis 2013). In
particular, Tc 1 displays unusually strong 4428 A and 6309 A DIBs, which are
normal (or not seen) in DY Cen. On the other hand, DY Cen displays an unusually
strong 6284 A DIB that is found to be normal in fullerene PNe. We also report
the detection of new broad and unidentified features centered at 4000 A and
6525 A in DY Cen and Tc 1, respectively. We suggest that the new 4000 A band
seen in DY Cen may be related to the circumstellar proto-fullerenes seen at
infrared wavelengths (Garcia-Hernandez et al. 2012a). However, the intense 4428
A DIB (probably also the 6309 A DIB and the new 6525 A band) may be related to
the presence of larger fullerenes (e.g., C80, C240, C320, and C540) and
buckyonions (multishell fullerenes such as C60@C240 and C60@C240@C540) in the

about 100 Mpc and are deflected by ~1 degree by predicted
intergalactic/galactic magnetic fields. The Pierre Auger Array, Telescope Array
and the future JEM-EUSO ISS mission will open charged-particle astronomy, but
much greater exposure will be required to fully identify and measure the
spectra of individual sources. OWL uses two large telescopes with 3 m optical
apertures and 45 degree FOV in near-equatorial orbits. Simulations of a
five-year OWL mission indicate ~10^6 km^2 sr yr of exposure with full aperture
at ~6 x 10^19 eV. Observations at different altitudes and spacecraft
separations optimize sensitivity to UHECRs and neutrinos. OWL's stereo event
reconstruction is nearly independent of track inclination and very tolerant of
atmospheric conditions. An optional monocular mode gives increased reliability
and can increase the instantaneous aperture. OWL can fully reconstruct
horizontal and upward-moving showers and so has high sensitivity to UHE
neutrinos. New capabilities in inflatable structures optics and silicon
photomultipliers can greatly increase photon sensitivity, reducing the energy
threshold for neutrino detection or increasing viewed area using a higher

clusters, the fraction of planetary systems with misalignment is > 6%, and only
1% have planets in retrograde orbits. We also obtain a positive correlation
between the survival planet number and the distance from the cluster center
$r$: planetary systems with a larger $r$ tend to be more stable. Moreover,
stars with a mass >2.5 $M_\odot$ are likely unstable and lose their planets.
These results are roughly consistent with current observations. Planetary
systems in binaries are less stable and we achieve a rough criterion: most of
the binary systems with $a_{\rm b}(1-e_{\rm b}^2)$>100 AU can keep all the
initial planets survived. Finally, 80% of the FFPs are ejected out of the

footpoint brightenings about 50 min prior to the flare occurrence. The kinked
filament rises-up slowly and after reaching a projected height of ~49 Mm, it
bends and falls freely near the AR, where the X-class flare was triggered.
Dynamic radio spectrum from the Green Bank Solar Radio Burst Spectrometer
(GBSRBS) shows simultaneous detection of both positive and negative drifting
pulsating structures (DPSs) in the decimetric radio frequencies (500-1200 MHz)
during the impulsive phase of the flare. The global negative DPSs in solar
flares are generally interpreted as a signature of electron acceleration
related to the upward moving plasmoids in the solar corona. The EUV images from
AIA 94 \AA reveal the ejection of multiple plasmoids, which move simultaneously
upward and downward in the corona during the magnetic reconnection. The
estimated speeds of the upward and downward moving plasmoids are ~152-362 and
~83-254 km/s, respectively. These observations strongly support the recent
numerical simulations of the formation and interaction of multiple plasmoids
due to tearing of the current-sheet structure. On the basis of our analysis, we
suggest that the simultaneous detection of both the negative and positive DPSs
is most likely generated by the interaction/coalescence of the multiple
plasmoids moving upward and downward along the current-sheet structure during
the magnetic reconnection process. Moreover, the differential emission measure
(DEM) analysis of the active region reveals presence of a hot flux-rope
structure (visible in AIA 131 and 94 \AA) prior to the flare initiation and
ejection of the multi-temperature plasmoids during the flare impulsive phase.

unphysical. When we pass to the stable family of perturbed metrics, we

the universe and which automatically obeys the non-linear sine-Gordon equation.
The Lagrangian for the sine-Gordon equation is a cosine potential agreeing to
the fourth order with the potential used in the approach to the generation of
mass in gauge theories. Accordingly we identify our geometric scalar
field---actually of the type of an abelian gauge field---with the recently
discovered scalar field. There are two constants in the theory: the first,
named $m$, is positive and defines a mass scale for the universe; the second,
named $\Lambda$, is the cosmological constant. For the space-time to be

condition to hold, these constants must obey the inequality $\Lambda > m^2/4$.

an inertia effect too which contributes to delight our lives. The final purpose

particular, TMOs with mixed valences have attracted attention for many energy
applications. Previous studies also showed that the ability to control the
number of d-band electron populations and detailed spin configurations is
critical for improved catalytic performance of TMOs. In this context,
SrCoO$_{x}$ (2.5 < x < 3.0) is an ideal class of materials due to the existence
of two structurally distinct topotatic phases, i.e. the brownmillerite
SrCoO$_{2.5}$(BM-SCO) and the perovskite SrCoO$_{3}$. Especially, BM-SCO has
atomically-ordered one-dimensional vacancy channels, which can accommodate
additional oxygen. Moreover, SrCoO$_{x}$ exhibits a wide spectrum of physical
properties depending on the oxygen stoichiometry. Since SrCoOx has only a
single knob to control the Co valence state without cation doping, it is an
attractive material for studying the valence state dependent physical
properties. However, so far, the growth of high quality single crystalline
materials has not been much studied due to difficulty in controlling the right
oxidation state. In this work, we report on the epitaxial growth of BM-SCO
single crystalline films on SrTiO3 by pulsed laser epitaxy. In order to examine
the topotactic phase transformation to the perovskite SrCoO$_{3-\delta}$, some
of samples were subsequently in-situ annealed at various oxygen pressure

holes in elliptical orbit and their surrounding disk with a gap.
  The gap in the disk is a low density region formed due to the tidal effects
of the less massive black hole. The binary we have investigated has a
sub-parsec separation and is coplanar with the disk. We find that the maximum
variation of the surface density in the gap reaches 50% during an orbital
period. However, in other regions of the disk, the density variation is much
less than 1%. Furthermore, we calculate the corresponding variation of spectral
energy distribution within a period, but little variation is found. The reason
for these results is that the viscosity timescale of the disk at the binary
radius is much longer than the orbital period of the binary.

GC sizes (characterised by the half-light radius $R_h$) and distances to the

($R_{obs}$) lies in the range $1\la R_{obs}/R_h\la15$ for about 85% of the
sample, with about 10% covering only the inner ($R_{obs}\la R_h$) parts. We
divide the WFC/ACS field of view across each cluster in a regular cell grid,
and extract the stellar-density Hess diagram from each cell, shifting it in
colour and magnitude along the reddening vector until matching the mean
diagram. Thus, the maps correspond to the internal dispersion of the reddening
around the mean. Depending on the number of available stars (i.e. probable
members with adequate photometric errors), the angular resolution of the maps
range from $\approx7\arcsec\times7\arcsec$ to
$\approx20\arcsec\times20\arcsec$. We detect spatially-variable extinction in
the 66 globular clusters studied, with mean values ranging from
$\mEBV\approx0.018$ (NGC\,6981) up to $\mEBV\approx0.16$ (Palomar\,2).
Differential-reddening correction decreases the observed foreground reddening
and the apparent distance modulus but, since they are related to the same value
of \EBV, the distance to the Sun is conserved. Fits to the mean-ridge lines of
the highly-extincted and photometrically scattered globular cluster Palomar\,2
show that age and metallicity also remain unchanged after the
differential-reddening correction, but measurement uncertainties decrease
because of the reduced scatter. The lack of systematic variations of \mEBV\
with both the foreground reddening and the sampled cluster area indicates that
the main source of differential reddening is interstellar.

numerical simulations are far from Earth's core in terms of several control
parameters. Different scaling analyses found simple scaling laws for quantities
like heat transport, flow velocity, magnetic field strength and magnetic

  We use an extensive dataset of 116 numerical dynamo models compiled by
Christensen and co-workers to analyse these scalings from a rigorous model
selection point of view. Our method of choice is leave-one-out cross-validation
which rates models according to their predictive abilities. In contrast to
earlier results, we find that diffusive processes are not negligible for the
flow velocity and magnetic field strength in the numerical dynamos. Also the
scaling of the magnetic dissipation time turns out to be more complex than
previously suggested. Assuming that the processes relevant in the numerical
models are the same as in Earth's core, we use this scaling to estimate an
Ohmic dissipation of 3-8 TW for the core. This appears to be consistent with
recent high CMB heat flux scenarios.

just an optional approach to enhance the system performance but the

also pointed out that the sum rate can be substantially improved by only adding
a few antennas at the BS when the system is N=KM with M denoting the antennas

inferred in a single observation) inference is prevalent, whereas for
segregated contextual diversity experiments (i.e., the referents are separated

as tadpoles that propagate sunward during solar flares, is presented. It is
argued that the regions of low density are flow channels carved by
sunward-directed outflow jets from reconnection. The solar corona is
stratified, so the flare site is populated by a lower density plasma than that
in the underlying arcade. As the jets penetrate the arcade, they carve out
regions of depleted plasma density which appear as SADs. The present
interpretation differs from previous models in that reconnection is localized
in space but not in time. Reconnection is continuous in time to explain why
SADs are not filled in from behind as they would if they were caused by
isolated descending flux tubes or the wakes behind them due to temporally
bursty reconnection. Reconnection is localized in space because outflow jets in
standard two-dimensional reconnection models expand in the normal (inflow)
direction with distance from the reconnection site, which would not produce
thin SADs as seen in observations. On the contrary, outflow jets in spatially
localized three-dimensional reconnection with an out-of-plane (guide) magnetic
field expand primarily in the out-of-plane direction and remain collimated in
the normal direction, which is consistent with observed SADs being thin.
Two-dimensional proof-of-principle simulations of reconnection with an
out-of-plane (guide) magnetic field confirm the creation of SAD-like depletion
regions and the necessity of density stratification. Three-dimensional
simulations confirm that localized reconnection remains collimated.

one imposes the local gauge symmetry of the Standard Model (SM) ($SU(3)_c
\times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$) to the SM and any possible new physics
scenarios, the SM Higgs properties will be modified by intrinsically two
different ways: by new physics either coupling directly to the SM Higgs boson
$h$, or affecting indirectly the SM Higgs properties through the mixing of $h$
with a SM singlet scalar $s$. The models of two Higgs doublet, extra sequential
and mirror fermions belong to the first category, whereas the models with a
hidden sector dark matter, extra vector-like fermions and new charged vector
bosons, which can enhance the diphoton rate of the SM Higgs-like resonance,
belong to the second category. We perform a global fit to data in terms of the
effective Lagrangian description of two interaction eigenstates of scalar
bosons, a SM Higgs and a singlet scalar, and their mixing. This framework is
more suitable to study singlet-extended scenarios discussed above compared to
other approaches based on the Lagrangian of mass eigenstates. With fairly
model-independent assumptions, the effective Lagrangian contains at most four
free parameters still encompassing the majority of models in the literature.
Interestingly, the SM gives the best fit if all data from ATLAS and CMS are
used, whereas various singlet extensions can fit better to individual ATLAS or
CMS data. Without further assumptions, an upper bound on the total width (or,
non-standard branching ratio) is generically obtained. Furthermore, global fit
based on our parameterization can be used to probe interactions of the singlet
scalar if the singlet resides below $2m_W$.

  One of the common kinds of clusterings are (balanced) least-squares
assignments with respect to a given set of sites. For these, there is a
'separating power diagram' for which each cluster lies in its own cell.
  In the present paper, we aim for efficient algorithms for outlier detection

separation of the clusters with 'point counting properties'; e.g. we are able
to prescribe how many points we want to classify as outliers.
  As our results hold for a more general non-convex model of free sites, we
describe it and our proofs in this more general way. Its locally optimal
solutions satisfy the aforementioned point counting properties. For our target
applications that use fixed sites, our algorithms are efficiently solvable to

from some molecular clouds near the Galactic center shows that this emission
component is due to the reflection of X-rays generated by a source that was
luminous in the past, most likely the central supermassive black hole,
Sagittarius A*. Studying the evolution of the molecular cloud reflection
features is therefore a key element to reconstruct Sgr A*'s past activity. The
aim of the present work is to study this emission on small angular scales in
order to characterize the source outburst on short time scales. We use Chandra
high-resolution data collected from 1999 to 2011 to study the most rapid
variations detected so far, those of clouds between 5' and 20' from Sgr A*
towards positive longitudes. Our systematic spectral-imaging analysis of the
reflection emission, notably of the Fe Kalpha line at 6.4 keV and its
associated 4-8 keV continuum, allows us to characterize the variations down to
15"" angular scale and 1-year time scale. We reveal for the first time abrupt
variations of few years only and in particular a short peaked emission, with a
factor of 10 increase followed by a comparable decrease, that propagates along
the dense filaments of the Bridge cloud. This 2-year peaked feature contrasts
with the slower 10-year linear variations we reveal in all the other molecular
structures of the region. Based on column density constraints, we argue that
these two different behaviors are unlikely to be due to the same illuminating
event. The variations are likely due to a highly variable active phase of Sgr
A* sometime within the past few hundred years, characterized by at least two
luminous outbursts of a few-year time scale and during which the Sgr A*
luminosity went up to at least 10^39 erg/s.

Moreover, the study of the interaction of these particles with the atmosphere
offers a unique window to study particle physics at an energy more than one
order of magnitude above the current highest energy human-made accelerator. In
this contribution selected results are presented, with a focus on the primary
mass composition, the determination of the number of muons, which is sensitive
to the shower hadronic interactions, and the measurement of the proton-air

models for the K^ - - K^ - and the K^ - -nucleon interactions as well as for
the nucleon-nucleon interaction. The binding energies and spatial shrinkages of
these states, obtained for various values of the Kbar N interaction, were found
to increase rapidly with the Kbar N interaction strength. Their behaviors are
shown in a reference diagram, where possible changes by varying the KbarN
interaction in the dense nuclear medium are given. Using the Lambda(1405)
ansatz with a PDG mass of 1405 MeV/ c^2 for K^-p, the following ground-state
binding energies together with the wave functions were obtained: 51.5 MeV ( K^
- pp ), 69 MeV ( K^ - ppn), 30.4 MeV ( K^ - K^ - p ) and 93 MeV ( K^ -K^ - pp
), which are in good agreement with previous results of variational calculation
based on the Akaishi-Yamazaki coupled-channel potential. The K^ - K^ - pp state
has a significantly increased density where the two nucleons are located very
close to each other, in spite of the inner NN repulsion. Relativistic
corrections on the calculated non-relativistic results indicate substantial
lowering of the bound-state masses, especially of K^-K^-pp , toward the kaon
condensation regime. The fact that the recently observed binding energy of
K^-pp is much larger (by a factor of 2) than the originally predicted one may
infer an enhancement of the KbarN interaction in dense nuclei by about 25 %,
possibly due to chiral symmetry restoration. In this respect some qualitative

received considerable attention in machine learning, and in many other

called independence-based learning. Such approach guarantees the learning of
the correct structure efficiently, whenever data is sufficient for representing
the underlying distribution. However, an important issue of such approach is
that the learned structures are encoded in an undirected graph. The problem
with graphs is that they cannot encode some types of independence relations,
such as the context-specific independences. They are a particular case of
conditional independences that is true only for a certain assignment of its
conditioning set, in contrast to conditional independences that must hold for
all its assignments. In this work we present CSPC, an independence-based
algorithm for learning structures that encode context-specific independences,
and encoding them in a log-linear model, instead of a graph. The central idea
of CSPC is combining the theoretical guarantees provided by the
independence-based approach with the benefits of representing complex
structures by using features in a log-linear model. We present experiments in a
synthetic case, showing that CSPC is more accurate than the state-of-the-art IB
algorithms when the underlying distribution contains CSIs.

proximity of an arbitrary function to a low-degree polynomial. Each rule
depends on the function's values at a small number of places. If a function
satisfies many rules then it is close to a low-degree polynomial. Low-degree
tests play an important role in the development of probabilistically checkable
proofs.
  In this paper we present two improvements to the efficiency of low-degree
tests. Our first improvement concerns the smallest field size over which a
low-degree test can work. We show how to test that a function is a degree $d$
polynomial over prime fields of size only $d+2$.
  Our second improvement shows a better efficiency of the low-degree test of
Rubinfeld and Sudan (Proc. SODA 1992) than previously known. We show concrete
applications of this improvement via the notion of ""locally checkable codes"".
This improvement translates into better tradeoffs on the size versus probe
complexity of probabilistically checkable proofs than previously known.

In particular, we focus our attention on Single and Multi-tape Turing machines

language which is strongly based on three methodological ideas borrowed from
Physics and applied to Mathematics, namely: the distinction between the object
(we speak here about a mathematical object) of an observation and the
instrument used for this observation; interrelations holding between the object
and the tool used for the observation; the accuracy of the observation
determined by the tool. Results of the observation executed by the traditional

  Eds. G. Chiribella, and R. Spekkens",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the operational approach to general probabilistic theories one
distinguishes two spaces, the state space of the ""elementary systems"" and the
physical space in which ""laboratory devices"" are embedded. Each of those spaces
has its own dimension- the minimal number of real parameters (coordinates)
needed to specify the state of system or a point within the physical space.
Within an operational framework to a physical theory, the two dimensions
coincide in a natural way under the following ""closeness"" requirement: the
dynamics of a single elementary system can be generated by the invariant
interaction between the system and the ""macroscopic transformation device"" that
itself is described from within the theory in the macroscopic (classical)
limit. Quantum mechanics fulfils this requirement since an arbitrary unitary
transformation of an elementary system (spin-1/2 or qubit) can be generated by
the pairwise invariant interaction between the spin and the constituents of a
large coherent state (""classical magnetic field""). Both the spin state space
and the ""classical field"" are then embedded in the Euclidean three-dimensional
space. Can we have a general probabilistic theory, other than quantum theory,
in which the elementary system (""generalized spin"") and the ""classical fields""
generating its dynamics are embedded in a higher-dimensional physical space? We
show that as long as the interaction is pairwise, this is impossible, and
quantum mechanics and the three-dimensional space remain the only solution.
However, having multi-particle interactions and a generalized notion of
""classical field"" may open up such a possibility.

potentials that modelize frictionless spheres in interaction. At finite
temperature, we study their glassy dynamics via field-theoretic methods by
resorting to a mapping towards an effective quantum mechanical evolution, and
show that such an approach resolves several technical problems encountered with
previous attempts. We then study the static, mean-field version of their glass
transition via replica theory, and set up an expansion in terms of the
corresponding static order parameter. Thanks to this expansion, we are able to
make a direct and exact comparison between historical Mode-Coupling results and
replica theory. Finally we study these models at zero temperature within the
hypotheses of the random-first-order-transition theory, and are able to derive
a quantitative mean-field theory of the jamming transition. The theoretic

has motivated physicists as well as biologists to imagine the design principles
governing machines in the fluctuating world. Recent experiments have clarified
yet another interesting property of F1; the dissipative heat inside the motor
is very small, irrespective of the velocity of rotation and energy transport.
Conceptual interest is devoted to the fact that the amount of internal
dissipation is not simply determined by the sequence of equilibrium pictures,
but also relies on the rotational-angular dependence of nucleotide affinity,
which is a truly nonequilibrium aspect. We propose that the totally asymmetric
allosteric model (TASAM), where adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding to F1 is
assumed to have low dependence on the angle of the rotating shaft, produces
results that are most consistent with the experiment. Theoretical analysis
proves the crucial role of two time scales in the model, which explains the
universal mechanism to produce the internal dissipation-free feature. The model
reproduces the characteristic torque dependence of the rotational velocity of
F1, and predicts that the internal dissipation upon the ATP synthesis direction
rotation becomes large at the low nucleotide condition.

manuscript focuses on development of simple static bayesian network models of
varying complexity that encompasses prior partially available biological
knowledge about intra and extra cellular factors affecting the Wnt pathway and
incorporates epigenetic information like methylation and histone modification
of a few genes known to have inhibitory affect on Wnt pathway. It might be
expected that such models not only increase cancer prediction accuracies and
also form basis for understanding Wnt signaling activity in different states of
tumorigenesis. Initial results in human colorectal cancer cases indicate that
incorporation of epigenetic information increases prediction accuracy of test
samples as being tumorous or normal. Receiver Operator Curves (ROC) and their
respective area under the curve (AUC) measurements, obtained from predictions
of state of test sample and corresponding predictions of the state of
activation of transcription complex of the Wnt pathway for the test sample,
indicate that there is significant difference between the Wnt pathway being on
(off) and its association with the sample being tumorous (normal). Two sample
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test confirm the statistical deviation between the
distributions of these predictions. At a preliminary stage, use of these models
may help in understanding the yet unknown effect of certain factors like DKK2,

the chromatic number of the graph is infinite. We also relate the syntactic
notion of algebras having a (complete) neat embedding property to the
semantical notion of having various forms of (complete) relativized

finite algebra is in the class SNr_3CA_6 is undecidable. In contrast, we show
that for a finite algebra of arbitary finite dimensions that embed into extra
dimensions of a another finite algebra, then this algebra have a finite
relativized representation. Finally we devise what we call neat games, for such
a game if \pe\ has a \ws \ on an atomic algebra \A in certain atomic game and
\pa has a \ws in another atomic game, then such algebras are elementary
equivalent to neat reducts, but do not have relativized (local) complete

finite variable fragments fails even if we consider clique guarded semantics.

Kohn-Sham theory, and relativistic extensions provide the well-established
formalism of density-functional theory (DFT). This theory enables the
calculation of all static properties of quantum systems {\it without} the need
for an n-body wavefunction \psi. DFT uses the one-body density distribution
instead of \psi. The more recent time-dependent formulations of DFT attempt to
describe the time evolution of quantum systems without using the time-dependent
wavefunction. Although DFT has become the standard tool of condensed-matter
computational quantum mechanics, its foundational implications have remained
largely unexplored. While all systems require quantum mechanics (QM) at T=0,
the pair-distribution functions (PDFs) of such quantum systems have been
accurately mapped into classical models at effective finite-T, and using
suitable non-local quantum potentials (e.g., to mimic Pauli exclusion effects).
These approaches shed light on the quantum \to hybrid \to classical models, and
provide a new way of looking at the existence of non- local correlations
without appealing to Bell's theorem. They also provide insights regarding
Bohmian mechanics. Furthermore, macroscopic systems even at 1 Kelvin have de
Broglie wavelengths in the micro-femtometer range, thereby eliminating
macroscopic cat states, and avoiding the need for {\it ad hoc} decoherence
models.

nanoparticles in vacuum do not suffer from clamping losses, hence leading to
much larger Q-factors. We find that for a levitated nanoparticle the thermal
energy suffices to drive the motion of the nanoparticle into the nonlinear
regime. First, we experimentally measure and fully characterize the frequency
fluctuations originating from thermal motion and nonlinearities. Second, we
demonstrate that feedback cooling can be used to mitigate these fluctuations.

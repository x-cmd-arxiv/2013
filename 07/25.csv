  figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose a novel framework called rigid body localization
for joint position and orientation estimation of a rigid body. We consider a
setup in which a few sensors are mounted on a rigid body. The absolute position
of the sensors on the rigid body, or the absolute position of the rigid body
itself is not known. However, we know how the sensors are mounted on the rigid
body, i.e., the sensor topology is known. Using range-only measurements between
the sensors and a few anchors (nodes with known absolute positions), and
without using any inertial measurements (e.g., accelerometers), we estimate the
position and orientation of the rigid body. For this purpose, the absolute
position of the sensors is expressed as an affine function of the Stiefel
manifold. In other words, we represent the orientation as a rotation matrix,
and absolute position as a translation vector. We propose a least-squares (LS),
simplified unitarily constrained LS (SUC-LS), and optimal unitarily constrained
least-squares (OUC-LS) estimator, where the latter is based on Newton's method.
As a benchmark, we derive a unitarily constrained Cram\'er-Rao bound (UC-CRB).
The known topology of the sensors can sometimes be perturbed during
fabrication. To take these perturbations into account, a simplified unitarily
constrained total-least-squares (SUC-TLS), and an optimal unitarily constrained
total-least-squares (OUC-TLS) estimator are also proposed.

Because dark matter is supposed to be electrically neutral, it is challenging
to build weakly interacting massive particle models that may accommodate both a

dark matter abundance. In this work, we consider the gamma ray signatures of a
class of scalar dark matter models that interact with Standard Model dominantly
through heavy vector-like fermions (the vector-like portal). We focus on a real
scalar singlet S annihilating into lepton-antilepton pairs. Because this
two-body final-state annihilation channel is d-wave suppressed in the chiral

gives a large correction, both today and at the time of freeze-out. For the
sake of comparison, we confront this scenario to the familiar case of a
Majorana singlet annihilating into light lepton-antilepton pairs, and show that
the virtual internal bremsstrahlung signal may be enhanced by a factor of (up
to) two orders of magnitude. We discuss the scope and possible generalizations
of the model.

important to the inspiral of small bodies into large black holes. These
resonances occur as the inspiral evolves through moments in which two
fundamental orbital frequencies, $\Omega_\theta$ and $\Omega_r$, are in a small
integer ratio to one another. Previous work has demonstrated that a binary's
parameters are ""kicked"" each time the inspiral passes through a resonance,
changing the orbit's characteristics relative to a model that neglects resonant
effects. In this paper, we use exact Kerr geodesics coupled to an accurate but
approximate model of inspiral to survey orbital parameter space and estimate
how commonly one encounters long-lived orbital resonances. We find that the
most important resonances last for a few hundred orbital cycles at mass ratio
$10^{-6}$, and that resonances are almost certain to occur during the time that
a large mass ratio binary would be a target of gravitational-wave observations.
Resonances appear to be ubiquitous in large mass ratio inspiral, and to last
long enough that they are likely to affect binary evolution in observationally
important ways.

of Kazhdan and Lusztig. In the case of $[n,n]$, the spider category is the
Temperley-Lieb category; reduced webs correspond to planar matchings, which are
equivalent to left cell bases. This paper compares the images of these bases
under classical maps: the {\em Robinson-Schensted algorithm} between

  One main result uses Vogan's generalized $\tau$-invariant to uncover a close

Intuitively, generalized $\tau$-invariants refine the data of the inversion set

K. Saito proved the converse. The same result is true for complete
intersections, but is much harder. For a Gorenstein surface singularity
$(V,0)$, the difference $\mu - \tau$ can be defined whether or not $V$ is
smoothable; it was proved in [23] that it is non-negative, and equal to 0 iff
$(V,0)$ is quasi-homogeneous. We conjecture a similar result for non-Gorenstein

independent of any smoothing. This expression, involving cohomology of exterior

is conjecturally non-negative, and equal to 0 iff one has quasi-homogeneity. We
prove the ""if"" part; identify special cases where the conjecture is
particularly interesting; verify it in some non-trivial cases; and prove it for
a $\Q$Gorenstein smoothing when the index one cover is a hypersurface. This
conjecture is of interest regarding the classification of surface singularities

was followed, its main presupposition being that each scale dependent state, in
a general renormalization flow, is a state that can be modeled using a class of
ninth degree polynomials. These polynomials are deduced from the Weierstrass
models of a certain kind of elliptic curves. As the consequences of this
presupposition unfolded, leading to the numerical study of a few samples of
elliptic curves, the L functions associated with these later were considered.
Their bifurcation diagrams were observed and their escape rates were
determined. The consistency of such an approach was put to a statistical test,
measuring the rank correlation between escape rates and values taken by these L
functions on the point z=1+0i. In the most significant case, the rank
correlation coefficient found, r_s, was about r_s=-0.78, with an associated
p-value of an order of magnitude close to the (-69) power of 10.

of polyetherimide at temperatures above the glass transition are strongly
influenced by space charge. We have studied space charge relaxation in two
commercial grades of polyetherimide, Ultem 1000 and Ultem 5000, using this
technique. The electric modulus formalism has been used to interpret their
conductive properties. In both grades of polyetherimide, asymmetric Argand
plots are observed, which are related to a sublinear power-law dependency
($\omega^{n}$ with $n<1$) in the real part of the conductivity. This behaviour
is attributed to correlated ion hopping. The imaginary part of the electric
modulus exhibits a peak in the low frequency range associated to conduction.
Modelling of this peak allows us to obtain the dependence, among other
parameters, of the conductivity ($\sigma_0$), the fractional exponent ($n$) and
the crossover frequency ($\omega_\mathrm{p}$) on the temperature. The $\alpha$
relaxation, that appears at higher frequencies, has also to be modelled since
it overlaps the conductivity relaxation. The study of the parameters in terms
of the temperature allows us to identify the ones that are thermally activated.
The difference between the conductivity relaxation time and the Maxwell
relaxation time indicates the presence of deep traps. The coupling model points
out that the correlation of the ionic motion diminishes with temperature,
probably due to increasing disorder due to thermal agitation.

to generate appreciable levels of force or movement. In skeletal muscle, for
example, hundreds of myosin II molecules cooperate in thick filaments. In
non-muscle cells, by contrast, small groups with few tens of non-muscle myosin
II motors contribute to essential cellular processes such as transport, shape
changes or mechanosensing. Here we introduce a detailed and analytically
tractable model for this important situation. Using a three-state crossbridge
model for the myosin II motor cycle and exploiting the assumptions of fast
power stroke kinetics and equal load sharing between motors in equivalent
states, we reduce the stochastic reaction network to a one-step master equation
for the binding and unbinding dynamics (parallel cluster model) and derive the
rules for ensemble movement. We find that for constant external load, ensemble
dynamics is strongly shaped by the catch bond character of myosin II, which
leads to an increase of the fraction of bound motors under load and thus to
firm attachment even for small ensembles. This adaptation to load results in a
concave force-velocity relation described by a Hill relation. For external load
provided by a linear spring, myosin II ensembles dynamically adjust themselves
towards an isometric state with constant average position and load. The
dynamics of the ensembles is now determined mainly by the distribution of
motors over the different kinds of bound states. For increasing stiffness of
the external spring, there is a sharp transition beyond which myosin II can no
longer perform the power stroke. Slow unbinding from the pre-power-stroke state
protects the ensembles against detachment.

instances of detection in which the prior probabilities of the hypotheses are
either completely and precisely known, or are completely unknown. Group
minimax, also known as Gamma-minimax, is a robust intermediary between Bayesian
and minimax hypothesis testing that allows for coarse or partial advance
knowledge of the hypothesis priors by using information on sets in which the
prior lies. Existing work on group minimax, however, does not consider the
question of how to define the sets or groups of priors; it is assumed that the
groups are given. In this work, we propose a novel intermediate detection
scheme formulated through the quantization of the space of prior probabilities
that optimally determines groups and also representative priors within the
groups. We show that when viewed from a quantization perspective, group minimax
amounts to determining centroids with a minimax Bayes risk error divergence
distortion criterion: the appropriate Bregman divergence for this task.
Moreover, the optimal partitioning of the space of prior probabilities is a
Bregman Voronoi diagram. Together, the optimal grouping and representation
points are an epsilon-net with respect to Bayes risk error divergence, and
permit a rate-distortion type asymptotic analysis of detection performance with
the number of groups. Examples of detecting signals corrupted by additive white
Gaussian noise and of distinguishing exponentially-distributed signals are
presented.

varieties. A top generalizes the idea of splitting a reflexive polytope into
two pieces. In contrast to the classification of reflexive polytopes, there are
infinite families of equivalence classes of tops. Tops may be used to describe
either fibrations or degenerations of Calabi-Yau varieties. We give a simple
combinatorial condition on tops which produces semistable degenerations of K3
surfaces, and, when appropriate smoothness conditions are met, semistable
degenerations of Calabi-Yau threefolds. Our method is constructive: given a
fixed reflexive polytope which will lie on the boundary of the top, we describe
an algorithm for constructing tops which yields semistable degenerations of the
corresponding hypersurfaces. The properties of each degeneration may be
computed directly from the combinatorial structure of the top.

square grid-generated turbulence is experimentally investigated using hot-wire
anemometry in a wind tunnel. The previous results are consolidated and
benchmarked with turbulence generated by regular square-mesh grids, designed to
retain certain geometrical parameters of the fractal square grid. This
comparison shows that the nonequilibrium behaviour is manifested in both
fractal square grid- and regular square-mesh grid-generated turbulence for a
downstream region during the turbulence decay up to the first few multiples of
the wake interaction distance. For one of the regular grids it is shown that
beyond this region there is a transition to the classical dissipation behaviour
if the local turbulent Reynolds number is sufficiently high. A sharp conclusion
can thus be drawn that this behaviour is more general than initially thought
and therefore of much greater scientific and engineering significance. The
nonequilibrium dissipation phenomena is further investigated by experimentally
measuring the terms of an inhomogeneous von Karman-Howarth-Monin equation. This
equation is essentially a scale-by-scale energy transfer budget. From the data
it is shown that the inhomogeneity of the turbulent flow does not tamper with
the nonequilibrium phenomena and that the scaling of the nonlinear energy
transfer, i.e. the transfer of energy to the small-scales, is out of balance
with the dissipation. This imbalance leads to the growth of the small-scale
advection to compensate for the increasing gap between the energy transferred
and the energy dissipated. For the highest Reynolds number data it is also
shown that the nonequilibrium dissipation scaling appears to be consistent with
the expectation that it is asymptotically independent of the viscosity with a
power-law spectra with the Kolmogorov-Obukhov exponent -5/3.

distributed approach to reviewing proposals, whereby a group of principal
investigators (PIs) or proposers in a subfield act as reviewers for the
proposals submitted by the same set of PIs. To encourage honesty, PIs' chances
for getting funded are tied to the quality of their reviews (with respect to
the reviews provided by the entire group), in addition to the quality of their
proposals. Intuitively, this approach can more fairly distribute the review
workload, discourage frivolous proposal submission, and encourage high quality
reviews. On the other hand, this method has already raised concerns about the
integrity of the process and the possibility of strategic manipulation. In this
paper, we take a closer look at three specific issues in an attempt to gain a
better understanding of the strengths and limitations of the new process beyond
first impressions and anecdotal evidence. We start by considering the benefits
and drawbacks of bundling the quality of PIs' reviews with the scientific merit
of their proposals. We then consider the issue of collusion and favoritism.
Finally, we examine whether the new process puts controversial proposals at a
disadvantage. We conclude that some benefits of using review quality as an
incentive mechanism may outweigh its drawbacks. On the other hand, even a
coalition of two PIs can cause significant harm to the process, as the built-in
incentives are not strong enough to deter collusion. While we also confirm the
common suspicion that the process is skewed toward non-controversial proposals,
the more unexpected finding is that among equally controversial proposals,
those of lower quality get a leg up through this process. Thus the process not
only favors non-controversial proposals, but in some sense, mediocrity. We also
discuss possible ways to improve this review process.

excitation of the matter field is more dramatic than that in usual case since
the parametric resonance lasts longer when the effect of a warp factor is taken

very useful to have a good notion of mean and variance for a set of diagrams.
In 2011, Mileyko and his collaborators made the first study of the properties
of the Fr\'echet mean in $(\mathcal{D}_p,W_p)$, the space of persistence
diagrams equipped with the p-th Wasserstein metric. In particular, they showed
that the Fr\'echet mean of a finite set of diagrams always exists, but is not
necessarily unique. The means of a continuously-varying set of diagrams do not
themselves (necessarily) vary continuously, which presents obvious problems
when trying to extend the Fr\'echet mean definition to the realm of vineyards.
  We fix this problem by altering the original definition of Fr\'echet mean so
that it now becomes a probability measure on the set of persistence diagrams;
in a nutshell, the mean of a set of diagrams will be a weighted sum of atomic
measures, where each atom is itself a persistence diagram determined using a
perturbation of the input diagrams. This definition gives for each $N$ a map
$(\mathcal{D}_p)^N \to \mathbb{P}(\mathcal{D}_p)$. We show that this map is
H\""older continuous on finite diagrams and thus can be used to build a useful
statistic on time-varying persistence diagrams, better known as vineyards.

classification of $p$-groups of minimal order that have nontrivial Bogomolov

the vanishing of the Bogomolov multiplier, and establishing a sequence of
Bogomolov's absolute $\gamma$-minimal factors which are $2$-groups of

Unfortunately, in hockey goal scoring is relatively infrequent, and statistics
like assists can be unreliable as a measure of a player's playmaking ability.
Assists also depend on playing time, power play usage, the strength of a
player's linemates, and other factors. In this paper we develop a metric for
quantifying playmaking ability that addresses these issues. Our playmaking
metric has two benefits over assists for which we can provide statistical

can assist decision-makers in identifying, acquiring, and integrating
successful playmakers into their lineups.

velocity function (CVF), a dynamical cousin of the halo mass function. The
correspondence between theoretical and observed CVFs is uncertain, however:
cluster galaxies are reported to exhibit a power-law CVF consistent with
$N$-body simulations, but that of the field is distinctly Schechter-like,
flattened relative to $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ expectations at circular velocities
$v_c \lesssim 200\, {\rm km\, s^{-1}}$. Groups offer a powerful probe of the
role environment plays in this discrepancy as they bridge the field and
clusters. Here, we construct the CVF for a large, mass- and
multiplicity-complete sample of group galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey. Using independent photometric $v_c$ estimators, we find no transition
from a field- to $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$-shaped CVF above $v_c = 50\, {\rm km\,

M_{\rm halo} / M_{\odot} \lesssim 15.1$ (Local Group analogs to rich clusters)
display similar Schechter-like CVFs marginally suppressed at low-$v_c$ compared
to that of the field. Conversely, some agreement with $N$-body results emerges
for samples saturated with late-type galaxies, with isolated late-types
displaying a CVF similar in shape to $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ predictions. We
conclude that the flattening of the low-$v_c$ slope in groups is due to their
depressed late-type fractions -- environment affecting the CVF only to the
extent that it correlates with this quantity -- and that previous cluster
analyses may suffer from interloper contamination. These results serve as
useful benchmarks for cosmological simulations of galaxy formation.

14C and 10Be from past impacts. In particular, the estimated mass of the
proposed Younger Dryas comet is consistent with its having deposited sufficient
isotopes to account for recorded 14C and 10Be increases at that time. The
26Al/10Be ratio is much larger in extraterrestrial objects than in the
atmosphere, and so, we note that measuring this ratio in ice cores is a
suitable definitive test for the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, even if the
hypothetical bolide is not a long-period comet and/or did not contribute to the
14C and 10Be increases.

at intermediate specific star formation rates (Tzanavaris et al. 2010).

of 99 compact groups containing 348 galaxies and compare the optical CMD with
mid-IR color space for compact group galaxies. Utilizing redshifts available
from SDSS, we identified new galaxy members for 6 groups. By combining optical
and mid-IR data, we obtain information on both the dust and the stellar
populations in compact group galaxies. We also compare with more isolated
galaxies and galaxies in the Coma cluster, which reveals that, similar to
clusters, compact groups are dominated by optically red galaxies. While we find
that compact group transition galaxies lie on the optical red sequence,
LVL+SINGS mid-IR transition galaxies span the range of optical colors. The
dearth of mid-IR transition galaxies in compact groups may be due to a lack of
moderately star forming low mass galaxies; the relative lack of these galaxies
could be due to their relatively small gravitational potential wells. This
makes them more susceptible to this dynamic environment, thus causing them to
more easily lose gas or be accreted by larger members.

reverberation mapping, the extensive observing time required by this method has
limited the practicality of applying it to large samples at a variety of

single-epoch spectroscopy of ultraviolet emission lines. We use ultraviolet

1664, HeII 1640, CII 1335, and MgII 2800 emission lines and explore their

The higher S/N and better spectral resolution of the Cosmic Origins
Spectrograph on Hubble Space Telescope resolves AGN intrinsic absorption and
produces more accurate line widths. From these, we test the viability of
mass-scaling relationships based on line widths and luminosities and carry out
a principal component analysis based on line luminosities, widths, skewness,
and kurtosis. At L_{1450} < 10^{45} erg/s, the UV line luminosities correlate
well with Hbeta, as does the 1450 Angstrom continuum luminosity. We find that

the continuum spectral energy distribution resulting from emission components

active nucleus, is preferentially magnified. This supports previous claims that
preferential magnification could mask the expected polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbon spectral features in the Spitzer mid-infrared spectrum which
roughly trace the star-forming regions. Furthermore, we show the
arc-to-counter-image flux ratio is not a good estimate of the magnification in
this system, despite its common use in the IRAS FSC10214+4724 literature. Our

A CO (1-0) counter-image is detected at the 3-sigma level. Five of the 42 km/s

their total magnification posterior PDFs sampled. This reveals a roughly linear
arrangement, tentatively a rotating disk. We derive a molecular gas mass of
M_gas = 1.2 +- 0.2 x 10^10 M_sun, assuming a ULIRG L_{CO}-to-M_{gas} conversion
ratio of \alpha = 0.8 M_sun / (K km/s pc^2) that agrees well with the derived
range of \alpha = 0.3 - 1.3 for separate dynamical mass estimates at assumed
inclinations of i = 90 - 30 degrees. Based on the AGN and CO (1-0) peak
emission positions and the lens model, we predict a distortion of the CO
Spectral Line Energy Distribution (SLED) where higher order J lines that may be
partially excited by AGN heating will be preferentially lensed owing to their
smaller solid angles and closer proximity to the AGN and therefore the cusp of
the caustic. Comparison with other lensing inversion results shows that the
narrow line region and AGN radio core in IRAS F10214+4724 are preferentially
lensed by a factor >~ 3 and 11 respectively, relative to the molecular gas

European VLBI Network detection to within milli-arcseconds of the modelled cusp
caustic, resulting in a very large magnification (\mu ~70), over an order of
magnitude larger than the CO (1-0) derived magnification of a spatially
resolved JVLA map, using the same lens model. We estimate the quasar bolometric
luminosity from a number of independent techniques and with our X-ray modelling
find evidence that the AGN may be close to Compton-thick, with an intrinsic
bolometric luminosity log(L_{bol,QSO} / L_sun) = 11.34 +- 0.27 dex. We make the

Sliding window stream joins are among the most important operators in a stream

sliding window stream join operator over a shared nothing cluster. We propose a
framework, based on fixed or predefined communication pattern, to distribute
the join processing loads over the shared-nothing cluster. We consider various

The current is inversely proportional to the maximum energy of cosmic rays, and

shock wave, which is drastically different for different circumstellar

current to trigger the non-resonant hybrid instability that confines the cosmic
rays follows a different evolution and reaches different values. We find that
the best candidates to accelerate cosmic rays to ~few PeV energies are young
remnants in a dense environment, such as a red supergiant wind, as may be
applicable to Cassiopeia A. We also find that for a typical background magnetic
field strength of 5 microG the instability is quenched in about 1000 years,
making SN1006 just at the border of candidates for cosmic ray acceleration to

Furthermore, the narrow deuterium linewidth requires a cool temperature <

a high redshift cold-accretion stream. The low-metallicity gas cloud is a
single component of an absorption system exhibiting a complex velocity,
ionization, and enrichment structure. Two other components have metallicities >
0.1 solar, ten times larger than the metal-poor component. We conclude that the
photoionized circumgalactic medium (CGM) of this galaxy is highly
inhomogeneous: the majority of the gas is in a cool, metal-poor and
predominantly neutral phase, but the majority of the metals are in a
highly-ionized phase exhibiting weak neutral hydrogen absorption but strong

the development of applications on clusters. It provides a global address space
partitioned among the cluster nodes, and is supported in programming languages
like C, C++, and Fortran by means of APIs. In this paper we provide a formal
model for the semantics of single instruction, multiple data programs using
PGAS APIs. Our model reflects the main features of popular real-world APIs such
as SHMEM, ARMCI, GASNet, GPI, and GASPI.
  A key feature of PGAS is the support for one-sided communication: a node may
directly read and write the memory located at a remote node, without explicit
synchronization with the processes running on the remote side. One-sided
communication increases performance by decoupling process synchronization from
data transfer, but requires the programmer to reason about appropriate
synchronizations between reads and writes. As a second contribution, we propose
and investigate robustness, a criterion for correct synchronization of PGAS
programs. Robustness corresponds to acyclicity of a suitable happens-before
relation defined on PGAS computations. The requirement is finer than the
classical data race freedom and rules out most false error reports.
  Our main result is an algorithm for checking robustness of PGAS programs. The
algorithm makes use of two insights. Using combinatorial arguments we first
show that, if a PGAS program is not robust, then there are computations in a
certain normal form that violate happens-before acyclicity. Intuitively,
normal-form computations delay remote accesses in an ordered way. We then
devise an algorithm that checks for cyclic normal-form computations.
Essentially, the algorithm is an emptiness check for a novel automaton model
that accepts normal-form computations in streaming fashion. Altogether, we

thermodynamic limit is associated with the appearance of a special type of
low-lying excitations in finite size energy spectra, the so called tower of

correspondence between the SU(2) tower of states and the lower part of the
ground state entanglement spectrum (ES). Using state-of-the-art DMRG
calculations, we examine the ES of the 2D antiferromagnetic J1-J2 Heisenberg
model on both the triangular and kagom\'e lattice. At large ferromagnetic J2
the model exhibits a magnetically ordered ground state. Correspondingly, its ES
contains a family of low-lying levels that are reminiscent of the energy tower
of states. Their behavior (level counting, finite size scaling in the
thermodynamic limit) sharply reflects tower of states features, and is
characterized in terms of an effective entanglement Hamiltonian that we
provide. At large system sizes TOS levels are divided from the rest by an
entanglement gap. Our analysis suggests that (TOS) entanglement spectroscopy
provides an alternative tool for detecting and characterizing SU(2)-broken

SMGs. We find the SMGs are most comparable to local ULIRGs in G0 and n, however
a significant tail of 5 of the 14 SMGs are likely best compared to less
compact, local starburst galaxies, providing new evidence that many SMGs have
extended star formation distributions and are therefore not simply scaled up
versions of local ULIRGs. We explore the limitations of using simple PDR models
to understand [CI], which may be concomitant with the bulk H2 mass rather than
PDR-distributed. We therefore also assess [CI] as a tracer of H2, finding that
for our sample SMGs, the H2 masses derived from [CI] are often consistent with

studies. However, most existing theoretical models of recurrent positive
selection cannot easily incorporate realistic confounding effects such as
interference between selected sites, arbitrary selection schemes, and
complicated demographic processes. It is possible to quantify the effects of
arbitrarily complex evolutionary models by performing forward population
genetic simulations, but forward simulations can be computationally prohibitive
for large population sizes ($> 10^5$). A common approach for overcoming these
computational limitations is rescaling of the most computationally expensive
parameters, especially population size. Here, we show that ad hoc approaches to
parameter rescaling under the recurrent hitchhiking model do not always provide
sufficiently accurate dynamics, potentially skewing patterns of diversity in
simulated DNA sequences. We derive an extension of the recurrent hitchhiking
model that is appropriate for strong selection in small population sizes, and
use it to develop a method for parameter rescaling that provides the best
possible computational performance for a given error tolerance. We perform a
detailed theoretical analysis of the robustness of rescaling across the
parameter space. Finally, we apply our rescaling algorithms to parameters that
were previously inferred for Drosophila, and discuss practical considerations

first, we deduce a proof of the PBW property for the {\it ascending} filtration
(with the filtered degree equal to the total degree in $x_i$'s) to a suitable
PBW-like property for the {\it descending} filtration (with the filtered degree
equal to the power of a polynomial parameter $\hbar$, introduced to the

genuine PBW property for the ascending filtration, for almost all

constructive method for proving this PBW-like property for the descending
filtration by powers of $\hbar$, emphasizing its integrability nature.
  We show how the method works in three examples. As a first example, we give a

a second, much less trivial example, we present a new proof of a result of
Etingof and Ginzburg [EG] on PBW property of algebras with a cyclic

results of the seminal work of Sigrist and Furusaki [J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 65,

are also analyzed. First, the magnetic profile around a single impurity and
effective interactions between impurities are analyzed within the bond-operator
mean-field theory and compared to density-matrix renormalization group
calculations. Then, the temperature behavior of the Curie constant is studied
in details. At zero-temperature, we give doping-dependent corrections to the
results of Sigrist and Furusaki on general bipartite lattice and compute
exactly the distribution of ladder cluster due to chain breaking effects. Using
exact diagonalization and quantum Monte-Carlo methods on the effective model,
the temperature dependence of the Curie constant is compared to a random dimer
model and a real-space renormalization group scenario. Next, the low-part of
the magnetic curve corresponding to the contribution of impurities is computed
using exact diagonalization. The random dimer model is shown to capture the
bulk of the curve, accounting for the deviation from the Brillouin response. At
zero-temperature, the effective model prediction agrees relatively well with
density-matrix renormalization group calculations. Finite-temperature effects

demonstrate the utility of these methods, we also give quick derivations of the
Chow groups of moduli spaces of curves of lower genus. The genus 6 case relies
on the particularly beautiful Brill-Noether theory in this case, and in

using the particle on the ring interacting with the dissipative environment as
an example. It is shown that the phenomenon of macroscopic quantization has the
clear physical origin in that case. It follows from the angular momentum
conservation combined with momentum quantization for bare particle on the ring
. The existence an observable which can take only integer values in the zero
temperature limit is rigorously proved. With the aid of the mapping between
particle on the ring and Ambegaokar-Eckern-Schon model, which can be used to
describe single-electron devices, it is demonstrated that this observable is
analogous to the ""effective charge"" introduced by Burmistrov and Pruisken for
the single-electron box problem. Different consequences of the revealed physics

  on $q$? A negative example","35 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  $l^q$-regularization has been demonstrated to be an attractive technique in
machine learning and statistical modeling. It attempts to improve the
generalization (prediction) capability of a machine (model) through
appropriately shrinking its coefficients. The shape of a $l^q$ estimator
differs in varying choices of the regularization order $q$. In particular,
$l^1$ leads to the LASSO estimate, while $l^{2}$ corresponds to the smooth
ridge regression. This makes the order $q$ a potential tuning parameter in
applications. To facilitate the use of $l^{q}$-regularization, we intend to
seek for a modeling strategy where an elaborative selection on $q$ is
avoidable. In this spirit, we place our investigation within a general
framework of $l^{q}$-regularized kernel learning under a sample dependent
hypothesis space (SDHS). For a designated class of kernel functions, we show
that all $l^{q}$ estimators for $0< q < \infty$ attain similar generalization
error bounds. These estimated bounds are almost optimal in the sense that up to
a logarithmic factor, the upper and lower bounds are asymptotically identical.
This finding tentatively reveals that, in some modeling contexts, the choice of
$q$ might not have a strong impact in terms of the generalization capability.
From this perspective, $q$ can be arbitrarily specified, or specified merely by
other no generalization criteria like smoothness, computational complexity,
sparsity, etc..

called the ""SPT-entanglement"", is defined as the entanglement between A and B,
two distant regions of the system, given that the total charge (associated with
the symmetry) in a third region C is measured and known, where C is a connected
region surrounded by A, B and the boundaries of the system. In the case of
1-dimensional systems we prove that in the limit where A and B are large and
far from each other compared to the correlation length, the SPT-entanglement
remains constant throughout a SPT phase, and furthermore, it is zero for the
trivial phase while it is nonzero for all the non-trivial phases. Moreover, we
show that the SPT-entanglement is invariant under the low-depth quantum
circuits which respect the symmetry, and hence it remains constant throughout a
SPT phase in the higher dimensions as well. Also, we show that there is an
intriguing connection between SPT-entanglement and the Fourier transform of the
string order parameters, which are the traditional tool for detecting SPT
phases. This leads to a new algorithm for extracting the relevant information

reproduction on a graph with two levels of interactions modeling
metapopulations. The population is spatially distributed into patches and
offspring are produced in each patch at a rate proportional to the number of
pairs of individuals in the patch (sexual reproduction) rather than simply the
number of individuals as in the basic contact process. Offspring produced at a
given patch either stay in their parents' patch or are sent to a nearby patch
with some fixed probabilities. Specifically, we prove lower and upper bounds
for the probability of long-term survival for the process starting with a
single fully occupied patch. Our main finding is that, with probability close
to one and for a certain set of parameters, the metapopulation survives in the
presence of nearest neighbor interactions while it dies out in the presence of
long range interactions, suggesting that the best strategy for the population
to expand in space is to use intermediate dispersal ranges. This result is due
to the presence of a so-called strong Allee effect induced by the birth
mechanism and does not hold for the basic contact process.

$\mathbb{Z}^d$ (for some fixed dimension $d\geq 1$) minimizing the total
weighted stretch of the edges. This problem arises in VLSI placement and chip
design.
  Motivated by these applications, we consider a generalization of d-dimAP,
where the positions of some of the vertices (pins) is fixed and specified as
part of the input. We are asked to extend this partial map to a map of all the
vertices, again minimizing the weighted stretch of edges. This generalization,
which we refer to as d-dimAP+, arises naturally in these application domains
(since it can capture blocked-off parts of the board, or the requirement of
power-carrying pins to be in certain locations, etc.). Perhaps surprisingly,
very little is known about this problem from an approximation viewpoint.
  For dimension $d=2$, we obtain an $O(k^{1/2} \cdot \log n)$-approximation
algorithm, based on a strengthening of the spreading-metric LP for 2-dimAP. The
integrality gap for this LP is shown to be $\Omega(k^{1/4})$. We also show that
it is NP-hard to approximate 2-dimAP+ within a factor better than
$\Omega(k^{1/4-\eps})$. We also consider a (conceptually harder, but
practically even more interesting) variant of 2-dimAP+, where the target space
is the grid $\mathbb{Z}_{\sqrt{n}} \times \mathbb{Z}_{\sqrt{n}}$, instead of
the entire integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2$. For this problem, we obtain a $O(k
\cdot \log^2{n})$-approximation using the same LP relaxation. We complement
this upper bound by showing an integrality gap of $\Omega(k^{1/2})$, and an
$\Omega(k^{1/2-\eps})$-inapproximability result.

microscopy has unmasked for the first time the unusual surface morphology of
TlBiSe$_{2}$ obtained by cleaving, where islands are formed by residual atoms
on the cleaved plane. The chemical condition of these islands was identified
using core-level spectroscopy. We observed thallium core-level spectra that are
strongly deformed by a surface component in sharp contrast to the other
elements. We propose a simple explanation for this behavior by assuming that
the sample cleaving breaks the bonding between thallium and selenium atoms,
leaving the thallium layer partially covering the selenium layer. These
findings will assist the interpretation of future experimental and theoretical
studies on this surface.

are repulsive on light rays like a concave lens. The present paper considers
microlensed image centroid motions by the exotic lens models. Numerical
calculations show that, for large $n$ cases in the convex-type models, the
centroid shift from the source position might move on a multiply-connected
curve like a bow tie, while it is known to move on an ellipse for $n=1$ case
and to move on an oval curve for $n=2$. The distinctive feature of the
microlensed image centroid may be used for searching (or constraining)
localized exotic matter or energy with astrometric observations. It is shown
also that the centroid shift trajectory for concave-type repulsive models might
be elongated vertically to the source motion direction like a prolate spheroid,
whereas that for convex-type models such as the Schwarzschild one is
tangentially elongated like an oblate spheroid.

It provides serial and parallel linear algebra capabilities. Before Trilinos
version 11.0, released in 2012, Epetra used the C++ int data-type for storing
global and local indices for degrees of freedom (DOFs). Since int is typically
32-bit, this limited the largest problem size to be smaller than approximately
two billion DOFs. This was true even if a distributed memory machine could
handle larger problems. We have added optional support for C++ long long

maintain the speed of memory-bound operations, and reduce further changes to
the code, the local indices are still 32-bit. We document the changes required
to achieve this feature and how the new functionality can be used. We also
report on the lessons learned in modifying a mature and popular package from

these last few years has been Voloshin's notion of colourings of mixed
hypergraphs. In this paper we shall study a specific instance of Voloshin's
idea: a non-monochromatic non-rainbow (NMNR) colouring of a hypergraph is a
colouring of its vertices such that every edge has at least two vertices
coloured with different colours (non-monochromatic) and no edge has all of its
vertices coloured with distinct colours (non-rainbow). Perhaps the most
intriguing phenomenon of such colourings is that a hypergraph can have gaps in
its NMNR chromatic spectrum, that is, for some $k_1 < k_2 < k_3$, the
hypergraph is NMNR colourable with $k_1$ and with $k_3$ colours but not with
$k_2$ colours.
  Several beautiful examples have been constructed of NMNR colourings of
hypergraphs exhibiting phenomena not seen in classical colourings. Many of
these examples are either \emph{ad hoc} or else are based on designs. The
latter are difficult to construct and they generally give uniform
$r$-hypergraphs only for low values of $r$, generally $r=3$. In this paper we
shall study the NMNR colourings of a type of $r$-uniform hypergraph which we
call $\sigma$-hypergraphs. The attractive feature of these $\sigma$-hypergraphs
is that they are easy to define, even for large $r$, and that, by suitable
modifications of their parameters, they can give families of hypergraphs which
are guaranteed to have NMNR spectra with gaps or NMNR spectra without gaps.
These $\sigma$-hypergraphs also team up very well with the notion of
colour-bounded hypergraphs recently introduced by Bujt{\'a}s and Tuza to give
further control on the appearance of gaps and perhaps explain better the
existence of gaps in the colouring of mixed hypergraphs.

publicly available Chandra data confirming a significant increase in the
projected X-ray temperature between the two cluster centers in A1750 consistent
with our expectations for a merging cluster. We model this system with a
self-consistent hydrodynamical simulation of dark matter and gas using the
FLASH code. Our simulations reproduce well the X-ray data, and the measured
redshift difference between the two clusters in the phase before the first core
passage viewed at an intermediate projection angle. The deprojected initial
relative velocity derived using our model is 1460 km/sec which is considerably
higher than the predicted mean impact velocity for simulated massive haloes
derived by recent LCDM cosmological simulations, but it is within the allowed
range. Our simulations demonstrate that such systems can be identified using a
multi-wavelength approach and numerical simulations, for which the statistical
distribution of relative impact velocities may provide a definitive examination
of a broad range of dark matter scenarios.

cooperation in society. However, it is highly unstable since some cooperators
may contribute to a common project but refuse to punish defectors. Centralized
sanctioning institutions (for example, tax-funded police and criminal courts)
can solve this problem by punishing both defectors and cooperators who refuse
to punish. These institutions have been shown to emerge naturally through
social learning and then displace all other forms of punishment, including peer
punishment. However, this result provokes a number of questions. If centralized
sanctioning is so successful, then why do many highly authoritarian states
suffer from low levels of cooperation? Why do states with high levels of public
good provision tend to rely more on citizen-driven peer punishment? And what
happens if centralized institutions can be circumvented by individual acts of
bribery? Here, we consider how corruption influences the evolution of
cooperation and punishment. Our model shows that the effectiveness of
centralized punishment in promoting cooperation breaks down when some actors in
the model are allowed to bribe centralized authorities. Counterintuitively,
increasing the sanctioning power of the central institution makes things even
worse, since this prevents peer punishers from playing a role in maintaining
cooperation. As a result, a weaker centralized authority is actually more
effective because it allows peer punishment to restore cooperation in the
presence of corruption. Our results provide an evolutionary rationale for why
public goods provision rarely flourishes in polities that rely only on strong
centralized institutions. Instead, cooperation requires both decentralized and
centralized enforcement. These results help to explain why citizen
participation is a fundamental necessity for policing the commons.

large-scale magnetic fields and the dynamo process on the Sun. The effect of
anisotropy is calculated in a mean-field magneto-hydrodynamics framework using
the minimal $\tau$-approximation. We examine two types of mean-field dynamo
models: the well-known benchmark flux-transport model, and a distributed-dynamo
model with the subsurface rotational shear layer. For both models we
investigate effects of the double-cell meridional circulation, recently
suggested by helioseismology. We introduce a parameter of anisotropy as a ratio
of the radial and horizontal intensity of turbulent mixing, to characterize the
anisotropy effects. It is found that the anisotropy of turbulent convection
affects the distribution of magnetic fields inside the convection zone. The
concentration of the magnetic flux near the bottom and top boundaries of the
convection zone is greater when the anisotropy is stronger. It is shown that
the critical dynamo number and the dynamo period approach to constant values
for the large anisotropy parameter. The anisotropy reduces the overlap of the
toroidal fields of subsequent cycles in the time-latitude ``butterfly' diagram.
If we assume that sunspots are formed in the vicinity of the subsurface shear
layer, then the distributed dynamo model with anisotropic diffusivity satisfies
the observational constraints from heloseismology results and is consistent
with the value of effective turbulent diffusion, estimated from the dynamics of
surface magnetic fields.

geometrical characterizations of whole classes of stationary cyclic symmetric

determination of the local and global energy-momentum-mass quantities using the
Brown-York approach. As far as to the algebraic-geometrical characterization is
concerned, the eigenvalue problem for the electromagnetic field,
energy-momentum and Cotton tensors is solved and their types are established.
  The families of Einstein-Maxwell solutions to be considered are: all uniform
electromagnetic solutions possessing electromagnetic fields with vanishing
covariant derivatives (stationary uniform and spinning Clement classes), all
fields having constant electromagnetic field and energy-momentum tensors'
invariants (Kamata-Koikawa solutions), the whole classes of hybrid
electromagnetic Ayon-Cataldo-Garcia solutions, a new family of stationary

This seems to be a better way for allocation of resources because in this case

avoids disconnect between them. Algorithms are presented for optimizing the
shared capacity, reputation based probabilistic allocation that is optimal for

tension between different ways of obtaining information about the structure of

IceCube data collected between April 2008 and May 2011 with three partially
completed configurations of the detector: the 40-, 59- and 79-string
configurations. The live-time of this data set are 1,040 days. An unbinned
maximum likelihood ratio test was used to search for an excess of neutrinos
above the atmospheric background at any given direction in the sky. By adding
two more years of data with improved event selection and reconstruction
techniques, the sensitivity was improved by a factor 3.5 or more with respect
to the previously published results obtained with the 40-string configuration
of IceCube. We performed an all-sky survey and a dedicated search using a
catalog of \textit{a priori} selected objects observed by other telescopes. In
both searches, the data are compatible with the background-only hypothesis. In
the absence of evidence for a signal, we set upper limits on the flux of muon
neutrinos. For an E$^{-2}$ neutrino spectrum, the observed limits are between
0.9 and $23.2\times 10^{-12}$ TeV$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$. We also report
upper limits for neutrino emission from groups of sources which were selected
according to theoretical models or observational parameters and analysed with a
stacking approach.

It is also widely used to study white dwarfs. In this paper, we discuss the
asteroseismology work of DAV stars. The detailed period to period fitting
method is fully discussed, including the reliability to detect the inner
structure of DAV stars. If we assume that all observed modes of some DAV star
are the $l$ = 1 ones, the errors of model fitting will be always great. If we
assume that the observed modes are composed of $l$ = 1 and 2 modes, the errors
of model fitting will be small. However, there will be modes identified as $l$
= 2 without quintuplets observed. G29-38 has been observed spectroscopically
and photometrically for many years. Thompson et al. (2008) made $l$
identifications for the star through limb darkening effect. With eleven known
$l$ modes, we also do the asteroseismology work for G29-38, which reduces the
blind $l$ fittings and is a fair choice. Unfortunately, our two best-fitting
models are not in line with the previous atmospheric results. Based on factors
of only a few modes observed, stability and identification of eigenmodes,
identification of spherical degrees, construction of physical and realistic
models and so on, detecting the inner structure of DAV stars by
asteroseismology needs further development.

increasing the belief that powerful ionised winds have a wider importance in
galaxy feedback models. Paradoxically, for the best-quantified high velocity
outflow (the luminous Seyfert PG1211+143) the wind appears too powerful to be
compatible with the observed stellar bulge and black hole masses, suggesting
the energy coupling of wind to bulge gas must be inefficient. A recent
XMM-Newton observation of the narrow line Seyfert NGC 4051 offers an
explanation of this apparent paradox, finding evidence for the fast ionised
wind to lose most of its kinetic energy after shocking against the ISM.
Importantly, the wind momentum is maintained through such a shock, supporting
the view that a momentum-driven flow provides the critical link between black
hole and stellar bulge masses implied by the observed M-sigma relationship.

in 2012. Early superhumps were recorded in both systems. During superoutburst
plateau, ordinary superhumps with a period of 0.060291(4) d (MASTER J211258)
and of 0.061307(9) d (MASTER J203749) in average were observed. MASTER J211258

increase in the superhump periods was seen in both systems. We have made a
survey of WZ Sge-type dwarf novae with multiple rebrightenings, and confirmed
that the superhump periods of WZ Sge-type dwarf novae with multiple
rebrightenings were longer than those of WZ Sge-type dwarf novae without a
rebrightening. Although WZ Sge-type dwarf novae with multiple rebrightenings
have been thought to be the good candidates for period bouncers based on their
low mass ratio (q) from inferred from the period of fully grown (stage B)
superhumps, our new method using the period of growing superhumps (stage A
superhumps), however, implies higher q than those expected from stage B
superhumps. These q values appear to be consistent with the duration of the
stage A superoutbursts, which likely reflects the growth time of the 3:1
resonance. We present a working hypothesis that the small fractional superhump
excesses for stage B superhumps in these systems may be explained as a result
that a higher gas pressure effect works in these systems than in ordinary SU
UMa-type dwarf novae. This result leads to a new picture that WZ Sge-type dwarf
novae with multiple rebrightenings and SU UMa-type dwarf novae without a

photon sensors whose sensitive area for Cherenkov photons one wants to
maximise. Low dark noise rates and dense module spacing will thereby allow to
substantially decrease the energy threshold in future projects. We describe a
feasibility study of a novel type of single photon sensor that employs organic
wavelength-shifting material (WLS) to capture Cherenkov photons and guide them
to a PMT readout. Different WLS materials have been tested in lab measurements
as candidates for use in such a sensor and photon capture efficiencies as high
as 50 % have been achieved. Based on these findings we estimate that the
effective photosensitive area of a prototype built with existing technology can
easily exceed that of modules currently used e. g. in IceCube. Additionally,
the dark noise rate of such a module can be exceptionally low in the order of

effects of the Reynolds number, the viscosity ratio, the wettability gradient,

significantly affected by the viscosity ratio, the magnitudes of the

very weak dependence on the Reynolds number.

global (population-level) regulation and load balancing for the case of TCL

Linear magnetohydrostatic (MHS) models of solar magnetic fields balance
plasma pressure gradients, gravity and Lorentz forces where the current density
is composed of a linear force-free component and a cross-field component that
depends on gravitational stratification. In this paper, we investigate an
efficient numerical procedure for calculating such equilibria.
  Methods. The MHS equations are reduced to two scalar elliptic equations - one
on the lower boundary and the other within the interior of the computational
domain. The normal component of the magnetic field is prescribed on the lower
boundary and a multigrid method is applied on both this boundary and within the
domain to find the poloidal scalar potential. Once solved to a desired
accuracy, the magnetic field, plasma pressure and density are found using a
finite difference method.
  Results. We investigate the effects of the cross-field currents on the linear
MHS equilibria. Force-free and non-force-free examples are given to demonstrate
the numerical scheme and an analysis of speed-up due to parallelization on a
graphics processing unit (GPU) is presented. It is shown that speed-ups of x30
are readily achievable.

homomorphisms of trees. We give an algorithm for the number of homomorphisms
from a tree to any graph by the Transfer-matrix method. By using this algorithm
and some transformations on trees, we study various extremal problems about the
number of homomorphisms of trees. These applications include a far reaching
generalization of Bollob\'as and Tyomkyn's result concerning the number of
walks in trees.
  Some other highlights of the paper are the following. Denote by $\hom(H,G)$
the number of homomorphisms from a graph $H$ to a graph $G$. For any tree $T_m$
on $m$ vertices we give a general lower bound for $\hom(T_m,G)$ by certain
entropies of Markov chains defined on the graph $G$. As a particular case, we
show that for any graph $G$,
$$\exp(H_{\lambda}(G))\lambda^{m-1}\leq\hom(T_m,G),$$ where $\lambda$ is the
largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of $G$ and $H_{\lambda}(G)$ is a
certain constant depending only on $G$ which we call the spectral entropy of
$G$. In the particular case when $G$ is the path $P_n$ on $n$ vertices, we
prove that $$\hom(P_m,P_n)\leq \hom(T_m,P_n)\leq \hom(S_m,P_n),$$ where $T_m$
is any tree on $m$ vertices, and $P_m$ and $S_m$ denote the path and star on
$m$ vertices, respectively. We also show that if $T_m$ is any fixed tree and
$$\hom(T_m,P_n)>\hom(T_m,T_n),$$ for some tree $T_n$ on $n$ vertices, then
$T_n$ must be the tree obtained from a path $P_{n-1}$ by attaching a pendant
vertex to the second vertex of $P_{n-1}$.
  All the results together enable us to show that $$
|\End(P_m)|\leq|\End(T_m)|\leq|\End(S_m)|, $$ where $\End(T_m)$ is the set of
all endomorphisms of $T_m$ (homomorphisms from $T_m$ to itself).

detection of terrestrial planets transiting nearby late-type M-dwarfs could
make this approach applicable within the next decade, with soon-to-come general
facilities. In this context, we previously identified GJ 1214 as a
high-priority target for a transit search, as the transit probability of a
habitable planet orbiting this nearby M4.5 dwarf would be significantly
enhanced by the transiting nature of GJ 1214 b, the super-Earth already known
to orbit the star. Based on this observation, we have set up an ambitious
high-precision photometric monitoring of GJ 1214 with the Spitzer Space
Telescope to probe the inner part of its habitable zone in search of a
transiting planet as small as Mars. We present here the results of this transit
search. Unfortunately, we did not detect any other transiting planets. Assuming
that GJ 1214 hosts a habitable planet larger than Mars that has an orbital
period smaller than 20.9 days, our global analysis of the whole Spitzer dataset
leads to an a posteriori no-transit probability of ~ 98%. Our analysis allows
us to significantly improve the characterization of GJ 1214 b, to measure its
occultation depth to be 70+-35 ppm at 4.5 microns, and to constrain it to be
smaller than 205ppm (3-sigma upper limit) at 3.6 microns. In agreement with the
many transmission measurements published so far for GJ 1214 b, these emission
measurements are consistent with both a metal-rich and a cloudy hydrogen-rich
atmosphere.

trench warfare and arms races in plant-pathogen systems. Trench warfare
situations are stable cycles of allele frequencies at the coevolving loci of
both host and parasite, and it is predicted that the loci will show molecular
evolutionary signatures of balancing selection, while arms races involve
successive selective sweeps at the interacting loci. We study a haploid
gene-for-gene model that includes mutation and genetic drift due to finite
population size. We study the outcomes under different coevolutionary
parameters to quantify the frequency of fixation of alleles, i.e. occurrence of
an arms race dynamics. We find that contrary to the conventional wisdom, trench
warfare situations do not imply larger numbers of coevolutionary cycles per
unit time than arms races. Therefore, one cannot infer the nature of the
dynamics in such systems based on the speed of coevolution estimated from cycle
times. We subsequently perform coalescent simulations to generate sequences at
the host and parasite loci. We ask whether the signatures expected under
balancing selection or selective sweeps (unexpectedly high or low diversity,
and high or low Tajima D values, respectively) are likely to be observable in
genomic data. Genomic footprints of recurrent selective sweeps are often found,
whereas trench warfare yields signatures of balancing selection only in
parasite sequences, and only in a limited parameter space with high effective
population sizes and long-term selection. Therefore, the existence of a
deterministic polymorphic equilibrium does not imply long-term trench warfare
necessary for the signature of balancing selection to be observed in the
coevolving genes sequence. Our results suggest that to search for signatures of
coevolution via population genomics, it is best to study pathogen rather than
host genomes.

largely used in numerical computations to localize the resonances in the
phase-space and, more recently, also the stable and unstable manifolds of
normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds. In this paper, we provide an analytic
description of the growth of tangent vectors for orbits with initial conditions
which are close to the stable-unstable manifolds of a hyperbolic saddle point

Indicator detects the stable-unstable manifolds of all fixed points which
satisfy a certain condition. If the condition is not satisfied, a suitably
modified Fast Lyapunov Indicator can be still used to detect the
stable-unstable manifolds. The new method allows for a detection of the

driving the acousto-optic deflector with multiple frequencies, we generate an
array of overlapping diffraction-limited beams that combine to form an

in a flat-bottomed potential formed by a laser beam with uniform intensity over
its central region confers numerous advantages over the harmonic confinement
intrinsic to Gaussian beam dipole traps and many other trapping schemes.We
demonstrate the versatility of this beam shaping method by generating
potentials with large flat-topped regions as well as intensity patterns
compensating for residual external potentials to create a uniform background to
which the trapping potential of experimental interest can be added.

that a pairing instability must be dominant over the tendency to magnetic order

dispersion, we find that the pairing of the electrons takes place
preferentially in a channel of f-wave symmetry, with an order parameter
vanishing at the position of the saddle points along the Fermi line. In the
case of the twisted bilayers, the dispersion has instead its symmetry reduced
down to the C_{3v} group and, most importantly, it leads to susceptibilities
that diverge at the saddle points but are integrable along the Fermi line. This
implies that a ferromagnetic instability becomes dominant in the twisted

amplified as the lowest subband of the electron system becomes flatter for

oscillators networking with a generic wiring of connections and displaying a
generic frequency distribution, we show how combining dynamical local
information on frequency mismatches and global information on the graph
topology suggests a judicious and yet practical weighting procedure which is
able to induce and enhance explosive, irreversible, transitions to
synchronization. We report extensive numerical and analytical evidence of the
validity and scalability of such a procedure for different initial frequency
distributions, for both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks, as well as for
both linear and non linear weighting functions. We furthermore report on the
possibility of parametrically controlling the width and extent of the
hysteretic region of coexistence of the unsynchronized and synchronized states.

from their screening attenuation produced on the natural cosmic muons flux.
Because of their open-sky exposure, muons telescopes are subject to noise
fluxes with large intensities relative to the tiny flux of interest. A
recognized source of noise flux comes from fake tracks caused by particles that
fortuitously trigger the telescope detectors at the same time. Such a flux may
be reduced by using multiple-detector telescopes so that fortuitous events
become very unlikely. In the present study, we report on a different type of
noise flux caused by upward-going muons crossing the detectors from the rear
side. We describe field experiments on La Soufri\'ere of Guadeloupe and Mount
Etna, and give details on the high-resolution clocking system and the
statistical procedure necessary to detect upward-going muons. We analyse
several data sets acquired either in calibration or in volcano tomography
situation. All data sets are shown clearly biased by upward-going noise flux
whose intensity may amount to 50% of the measured total flux in given

Platonic solids in four dimensions - can be constructed from three-dimensional
considerations concerning the Platonic solids alone. Via the Cartan-Dieudonne
theorem, the reflective symmetries of the Platonic solids generate rotations.
In a Clifford algebra framework, the space of spinors generating such
three-dimensional rotations has a natural four-dimensional Euclidean structure.
The spinors arising from the Platonic Solids can thus in turn be interpreted as
vertices in four-dimensional space, giving a simple construction of the 4D
polytopes 16-cell, 24-cell, the F_4 root system and the 600-cell. In
particular, these polytopes have `mysterious' symmetries, that are almost
trivial when seen from the three-dimensional spinorial point of view. In fact,
all these induced polytopes are also known to be root systems and thus generate
rank-4 Coxeter groups, which can be shown to be a general property of the
spinor construction. These considerations thus also apply to other root systems
such as A_1+I_2(n) which induces I_2(n)+I_2(n), explaining the existence of the
grand antiprism and the snub 24-cell, as well as their symmetries. We discuss
these results in the wider mathematical context of Arnol'd's trinities and the
McKay correspondence. These results are thus a novel link between the
geometries of three and four dimensions, with interesting potential
applications on both sides of the correspondence, to real 3D systems with
polyhedral symmetries such as (quasi)crystals and viruses, as well as 4D
geometries arising for instance in Grand Unified Theories and String and
M-Theory.

energies by VERITAS at 16.4 standard deviation (sigma) significance in 7.6
hours of observation in a low flux state. A multiwavelength spectral energy
distribution (SED) is constructed from contemporaneous data from VERITAS,
Fermi-LAT, RXTE PCA, and Swift UVOT. Swift XRT data is not included in the SED
due to a lack of simultaneous observations with VERITAS. In contrast to the
orphan gamma-ray flare exhibited by this source in 2002, the X-ray flux of the
source is found to vary by an order of magnitude, while other energy regimes
exhibit less variable emission. A quasi-equilibrium synchrotron self-Compton
model with an additional external radiation field is used to describe three
SEDs corresponding to the lowest, highest, and average X-ray states. The
variation in the X-ray spectrum is modeled by changing the electron injection
spectral index, with minor adjustments of the kinetic luminosity in electrons.
This scenario produces small-scale flux variability of order >~2 in the HE (E>1
MeV) and VHE (E>100 GeV) gamma-ray regimes, which is corroborated by the
Fermi-LAT, VERITAS, and Whipple 10m telescope light curves.

differences in coverage by standard bibliometric databases installed a
dichotomy between on the one hand the well covered 'exact' sciences, and on the
other hand most of the social sciences and humanities with a more limited
coverage (Nederhof, 2006). Also the latter domains need to be able to soundly
demonstrate their level of performance and claim or legitimate funding
accordingly. An important part of the output volume in social sciences appears
as books, book chapters and national literature (Hicks, 2004). To proceed from
publication data to performance measurement, quantitative publication counts
need to be combined with qualitative information, for example from peer
assessment or validation (European Expert Group on Assessment of
University-Based Research, 2010), to identify those categories that represent
research quality as perceived by peers. An accurate focus is crucial in order
to stimulate, recognize and reward high quality achievements only. This paper
demonstrates how such a selection of publication categories can be based on
correlations with peer judgments. It is also illustrated that the selection
should be sufficiently precise, to avoid subcategories negatively correlated
with peer judgments. The findings indicate that, also in social sciences and
humanities, publications in journals with an international referee system are
the most important category for evaluating quality. Book chapters with
international referee system and contributions in international conference

support. There is however not yet a generally accepted quantitative method or
set of criteria to recognize and evaluate interdisciplinary research outputs

as distinguished in overviews from the first codifications (Klein, 1990) to the
latest reference work (Frodeman et al., 2010). In the specific context of
research measurement and evaluation, interdisciplinarity was discussed e.g. by
Rinia (2007) and Porter et al. (2006). This empirical study aims to contribute
to the understanding and the measuring of interdisciplinary research at the
micro level, in the form of new synergies between disciplines. Investigation of
a specialized funding program shows how a new interdisciplinary synergy and its
citation impact are visible in co-publications and cocitations, and that these
are important parameters for assessment. The results also demonstrate the
effect of funding, which is clearly present after about three years.

interconnected world is composed of networks that are coupled to each other
through different ""layers"" that each represent one of many possible subsystems
or types of interactions. Nevertheless, it is traditional to aggregate
multilayer networks into a single weighted network in order to take advantage
of existing tools. This is admittedly convenient, but it is also extremely
problematic, as important information can be lost as a result. It is therefore
important to develop multilayer generalizations of network concepts. In this
paper, we analyze triadic relations and generalize the idea of transitivity to
multiplex networks. By focusing on triadic relations, which yield the simplest
type of transitivity, we generalize the concept and computation of clustering
coefficients to multiplex networks. We show how the layered structure of such
networks introduces a new degree of freedom that has a fundamental effect on
transitivity. We compute multiplex clustering coefficients for several real
multiplex networks and illustrate why one must take great care when
generalizing standard network concepts to multiplex networks. We also derive
analytical expressions for our clustering coefficients for ensemble averages of
networks in a family of random multiplex networks. Our analysis illustrates
that social networks have a strong tendency to promote redundancy by closing
triads at every layer and that they thereby have a different type of multiplex
transitivity from transportation networks, which do not exhibit such a
tendency. These insights are invisible if one only studies aggregated networks.

polarizing field. The condensation is manifested by coherent precession of the
magnetization with a common frequency in a large volume. The trap shape is
controlled by the profile of the applied magnetic field and by the condensate
itself via the spin-orbit interaction. The trapping potential can be
experimentally determined with the spectroscopy of the magnon levels in the

switching off the pumping in the temperature range $(0.14\div

spin-diffusion with the diffusion coefficient proportional to the density of
thermal quasiparticles and (2) the approximately temperature-independent
radiation damping caused by the losses in the NMR pick-up circuit. The measured
dependence of the relaxation on the shape of the trapping potential is in a
good agreement with our calculations based on the magnetic field profile and

(linear in spin) contribution to this effect is currently known at leading
post-Newtonian order, namely 3PN for maximally spinning black holes on
quasi-circular orbits. In the present work, we generalize these tail-originated

extending previous results on the dynamical evolution of precessing compact

result for a test particle around a Kerr black hole, computed by perturbation
theory. The BH-horizon absorption terms have to be added to the PN result
computed here. Our work completes the knowledge of the spin-orbit effects to
the phasing of compact binaries up to the 4PN order, and will allow the
building of more faithful PN templates for the inspiral phase of black hole

transverse energy, jet transverse momentum and jet rapidity. In addition, the
bin-averaged cross sections as functions of the difference between the
azimuthal angles of the photon and the jet, the photon--jet invariant mass and
the scattering angle in the photon--jet centre-of-mass frame have been
measured. Next-to-leading-order QCD calculations are compared to the
measurements and provide a good description of the data, except for the case of
the azimuthal opening angle.

increasingly important to define adequate supporting measures to help identify
excellent scientists. Highly cited publications have since long been associated
to research excellence. At the same time, the analysis of the high-end of
citation distributions still is a challenging topic in evaluative
bibliometrics. Evaluations typically require indicators that generate
sufficiently stable results when applied to recent publication records of
limited size. Highly cited publications have been identified using two
techniques in particular: pre-set percentiles, and the parameter free
Characteristic Scores and Scales (CSS) (Gl\""anzel & Schubert, 1988). The
stability required in assessments of relatively small publication records,
concerns size as well as content of groups of highly cited publications.
Influencing factors include domain delineation and citation window length.
Stability in size is evident for the pre-set percentiles, and has been
demonstrated for the CSS-methodology beyond an initial citation period of about
three years (Gl\""anzel, 2007). Stability in content is less straightforward,
considering for instance that more highly cited publications can have a later
citation peak, as observed by Abt (1981) for astronomical papers. This paper
investigates the stability in content of groups of highly cited publications,
i.e. the extent to which individual publications enter and leave the group as
the citation window is enlarged.

quasars that selects systems using similar techniques. We confirm the existence
of so-called ""strong N V"" intrinsic systems (where the equivalent width of H I
Ly alpha is small compared to N V 1238) presented in that work, but find no
convincing cases of ""strong C IV"" intrinsic systems at low redshift/luminosity.
Moreover, we also report on the existence of ""strong O VI"" systems. From a
comparison of partial coverage results as a function of ion, we conclude that
systems selected by the N V ion have the highest probability of being
intrinsic. By contrast, the C IV and O VI ions are poor selectors. Of the 30 O
VI systems tested, only two of the systems in the spectrum on 3C 351 show
convincing evidence for partial coverage. However, there is a 3-sigma excess in
the number of absorbers near the quasar redshift (|Delta v| <= 5000 km/s) over
absorbers at large redshift differences. In at least two cases, the associated
O VI systems are known not to arise close to the accretion disk of the quasar.

extreme black hole. We study numerically the nonlinear evolution of this
instability for spherically symmetric perturbations of an extreme
Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) black hole. We find that generically the endpoint of
the instability is a non-extreme RN solution. However, there exist fine-tuned
initial perturbations for which the instability never decays. In this case, the
perturbed spacetime describes a time-dependent extreme black hole. Such
solutions settle down to extreme RN outside, but not on, the event horizon. The
event horizon remains smooth but certain observers who cross it at late time
experience large gradients there. Our results indicate that these dynamical
extreme black holes admit a C^1 extension across an inner (Cauchy) horizon.

native fold after sampling only a tiny fraction of all possible structures.
Although protein folding is now understood to be concomitant with synthesis on
the ribosome there have been few attempts to modify energy landscape theory by
accounting for cotranslational folding. This paper introduces a model for
cotranslational folding that leads to a natural definition of a nested energy
landscape. By applying concepts drawn from submanifold differential geometry
the dynamics of protein folding on the ribosome can be explored in a
quantitative manner and conditions on the nested potential energy landscapes
for a good cotranslational folder are obtained. A generalisation of diffusion
rate theory using van Kampen's technique of composite stochastic processes is
then used to account for entropic contributions and the effects of variable
translation rates on cotranslational folding. This stochastic approach agrees
well with experimental results and Hamiltionian formalism in the deterministic
limit.

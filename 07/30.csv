$\sqrt{s} = 1.96 \text{TeV}$ proton-antiproton collision data collected by CDF
and D0 experiments at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. Earlier measurements from
CDF and D0 are combined with the two latest, more precise measurements: a CDF
measurement in the electron and muon channels using data corresponding to $2.2
\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity, and a D0 measurement in the
electron channel using data corresponding to $4.3 \mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of
integrated luminosity. The resulting Tevatron average for the mass of the $W$
boson is $\MW = 80\,387 \pm 16 \text{MeV}$. Including measurements obtained in
electron-positron collisions at LEP yields the most precise value of $\MW =
80\,385 \pm 15 \text{MeV}$.

pulsars (MSPs), four in binary systems with probable white dwarf companions and
one isolated, found in ongoing processing of the High Time Resolution Universe
Pulsar Survey (HTRU). We also present high quality polarimetric data on four of
them. These further discoveries confirm the high potential of our survey in
finding pulsars with very short spin periods. At least two of these five MSPs
are excellent candidates to be included in the Pulsar Timing Array projects.
Thanks to the wealth of MSP discoveries in the HTRU survey, we revisit the
question of whether the luminosity distributions of isolated and binary MSPs
are different. Using the Cordes and Lazio distance model and our new and
catalogue flux density measurements, we find that 41 of the 42 most luminous
MSPs in the Galactic disk are in binaries and a statistical analysis suggests
that the luminosity functions differ with 99.9% significance. We conclude that
the formation process that leads to solitary MSPs affects their luminosities,
despite their period and period derivatives being similar to those of pulsars
in binary systems.

analogous to the eightfold-way for mesons. As the black hole symmetry group we
single out the group SO(2N+1) with N the black hole entropy. The Hilbert space
is identified with the spinor irrep of SO(2N+1). Evaporation processes of
m-quanta are associated to the breaking SO(2N+1) to SO(2(N-m)+1) X SO(2m).
Under these assumptions we get a group-theoretic understanding of the
evaporation process and of some typical time scales of black holes, such as
Page's and scrambling times. We also discuss from the group theory point of
view the mechanism of generation of entanglement both between the black hole
and the radiated quanta as well as among the black hole constituents

The separation of equal amounts of electric charge of different sign in
different graphene layers is achieved by applying electric field perpendicular
to the layers. The stored charge, energy, and the electric potential difference
generated between the metallic layers are calculated from the first-principles
for the relaxed structures. Predicted high-capacitance values exhibit the

algebraic groups and their associated degenerate flag varieties. It has been
shown by Feigin, Finkelberg, and Littelmann that the degenerate flag varieties
in types $A_n$ and $C_n$ are Frobenius split. In this paper we construct an
associated degeneration of homogeneous coordinate rings of classical flag
varieties in all types and show that these rings are Frobenius split in most
types. It follows that the degenerate flag varieties of types $A_n$, $C_n$ and
$G_2$ are Frobenius split. In particular we obtain an alternate proof of
splitting in types $A_n$ and $C_n$; the case $G_2$ was not previously known. We
also give a representation-theoretic condition on PBW-graded versions of Weyl
modules which is equivalent to the existence of a Frobenius splitting of the
classical flag variety that maximally compatibly splits the identity.

ruled manifolds to bundles whose fibre is a classical flag variety. This is
done using Chern class computations involving the combinatorics of Schur
functors. The strongest results are obtained when working over a Riemann
surface. Weaker partial results are obtained for adiabatic polarisations over a
base of arbitrary dimension.
  We develop the notion of relative K-stability which embeds the idea of
working over a base variety into the theory of K-stability. Natural
constructions in filtered algebras equip the collection of test configuration
with extra structures. We illustrate these constructions with several examples.

medieval Black Death, was recently sequenced and assembled into 2,105 contigs
from the main chromosome. According to the point mutation record, the medieval
bacteria could be an ancestor of most Yersinia pestis extant species, which
opens the way to reconstructing the organization of these contigs using a
comparative approach. We show that recent computational paleogenomics methods,
aiming at reconstructing the organization of ancestral genomes from the
comparison of extant genomes, can be used to correct, order and complete the
contig set of the Black Death agent genome, providing a full chromosome
sequence, at the nucleotide scale, of this ancient bacteria. This sequence
suggests that a burst of mobile elements insertions predated the Black Death,
leading to an exceptional genome plasticity and increase in rearrangement rate.

While ferroelectricity is favored for all compressive strains, for tensile

coexistence of ferroelectricity and antiferroelectricity observed in thin films

superfluid 3He infused into a low-density, homogeneous uniaxial aerogel.
Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory for a class of equal-spin-pairing (ESP) states in a
medium with uniaxial anisotropy is developed and used to analyze recent
experiments on uniaxially strained aerogels. For 3He in an axially ""stretched""
aerogel GL theory predicts a transition from normal liquid into a chiral ABM
phase at T_c1 in which the chirality axis, l, is aligned along the strain axis.
This orbitally aligned state, is protected from random fluctuations in the
anisotropy direction, has a positive NMR frequency shift, a sharp NMR resonance
line and is identified with the high-temperature ESP-1 phase of superfluid 3He
in axially stretched aerogel. A second transition into a biaxial phase is
predicted to onset at a slightly lower temperature, T_c2 < T_c1. This phase is
an ESP state, breaks time-reversal symmetry, and is defined by an orbital order
parameter that spontaneously breaks axial rotation symmetry. This transition is
driven by the coupling of an axially aligned 1D ""polar"" order parameter to the
two time-reversed 2D axial ABM states. The biaxial phase has a continuous
degeneracy associated with the projection of its chiral axis in the plane
normal to the anisotropy axis. Theoretical predictions for the NMR frequency
shifts of the biaxial phase provide an identification of the ESP-2 as the
biaxial state, partially disordered by random anisotropy (Larkin-Imry-Ma
effect). The ""width"" of the jump in the NMR frequency shift at T_c2 provides an
estimate of the orbital domain size, xi_LIM ~ 5 mu-m at 18 bar.

direct effect of inhibitory nodes is to decrease activity, the collective

defining and analyzing a ""branching function"" which may be thought of as an
activity-dependent branching ratio. The shape of the branching function implies
that for a range of global coupling parameters dynamics are self-sustaining.
Within the self-sustaining region of parameter space lies a critical line along
which dynamics take the form of avalanches with universal scaling of size and

a disordered network of point masses connected by unbreakable springs. At a

undergoes a rigidity transition signaled by a vanishing shear modulus and
transverse sound speed. We investigate analytically and numerically the linear
and non-linear visco-elastic response of these fragile solids by probing how
shear fronts propagate through them. Our approach, that we tentatively label
shear front rheology, provides an alternative route to standard oscillatory
rheology. In the linear regime, we observe at late times a diffusive broadening
of the fronts controlled by an effective shear viscosity that diverges at the
critical point. No matter how small the microscopic coefficient of dissipation,
strongly disordered networks behave as if they were over-damped because energy
is irreversibly leaked into diverging non-affine fluctuations. Close to the
transition, the regime of linear response becomes vanishingly small: the
tiniest shear strains generate strongly non-linear shear shock waves
qualitatively different from their compressional counterparts in granular
media. The inherent non-linearities trigger an energy cascade from low to high
frequency components that keep the network away from attaining the quasi-static
limit. This mechanism, reminiscent of acoustic turbulence, causes a
super-diffusive broadening of the shock width.

at a Poincar\'e section. We then prove that the fixed points of the Poincar\'e
map correspond to stationary flow-rates on the two links. With Lyapunov's first
method, we demonstrate that the Poincar\'e map can be finite-time stable,
asymptotically stable, or unstable. When unstable, the map is found to have
periodical points of period two, but no chaotic solutions. Comparing the
results with those in existing studies, we conclude that the Poincar\'e map can
be used to represent network-wide dynamics in the kinematic wave model. We
further analyze the bifurcation in the stability of the Poincar\'e map caused
by varying route choice proportions. We further apply the Poincar\'e map
approach to analyzing traffic patterns in more general $(DM)^n$ and beltway
networks, which are sufficient and necessary structures for network-induced
unstable traffic and gridlock, respectively. This study demonstrates that the
Poincar\'e map approach can be efficiently applied to analyze traffic dynamics
in any road networks with circular information propagation and provides new
insights into unstable traffic dynamics caused by interactions among network
bottlenecks.

expression is primarily from the maternal or paternal allele. Imprinting may
arise as a consequence of mechanisms for silencing of transposons during
reproduction, and in some cases imprinted expression of particular genes may
provide a selective advantage such that it is conserved across species.
Separate mechanisms for the origin of imprinted expression patterns and
maintenance of these patterns may result in substantial variation in the
targets of imprinting in different species. Here we present deep sequencing of
RNAs isolated from reciprocal crosses of four diverse maize genotypes,
providing a comprehensive analysis of imprinting in maize that allows
evaluation of imprinting at more than 95% of endosperm-expressed genes. We find
that over 500 genes exhibit statistically significant parent-of-origin effects
in maize endosperm tissue, but focused our analyses on a subset of these genes
that had >90% expression from the maternal allele (69 genes) or from the
paternal allele (108 genes) in at least one reciprocal cross. Over 10% of
imprinted genes show evidence of allelic variation for imprinting. A comparison
of imprinting in maize and rice reveals that only 13% of genes with syntenic
orthologs in both species exhibit conserved imprinting. Genes that exhibit
conserved imprinting in maize relative to rice have elevated dN/dS ratios
compared to other imprinted genes, suggesting a history of more rapid
evolution. Together, these data suggest that imprinting only has functional
relevance at a subset of loci that currently exhibit imprinting in maize.

decaying in a hot and dense plasma of Standard Model particles, whose
temperature is much smaller than the mass of the Majorana neutrino but still
much larger than the electroweak scale. The neutrino width gets
zero-temperature contributions that can be computed from in-vacuum matrix
elements, and thermal corrections. Only the latter will be addressed. Symmetry
and power counting arguments made manifest by the effective field theory
restrict the form of the thermal corrections and simplify their calculation.
The final result agrees with recent determinations obtained with different

masses onto the companion during a periastron passage (the first passage) of
the binary system approximately 20 days before the observed maximum of the
light curve. In the first scenario, the surviving companion scenario, the
companion was not destructed and still exists in the system after the outburst.
It ejected partial shells (or collimated outflows or clumps) for two
consecutive periastron passages after the major one. The orbital period was
reduced from ~38 days to ~25 days as a result of the mass transfer process that
took place during the first periastron passage. In the second scenario, the
merger scenario, some partial shells/clumps were ejected also in a second
periastron passage that took place ~20 days after the first one. After this
second periastron passage the companion dived too deep into the LBV envelope to
launch more outflows, and merged with the LBV.

star-black hole and black hole-black hole mergers in full general relativity.
We focus on a configuration with non spinning objects and within the most
likely range of mass ratio for neutron star-black hole systems (q=6). In this
region of the parameter space, the neutron star is not tidally disrupted prior
to merger, and we show that the two types of mergers appear remarkably similar.
The effect of the presence of a neutron star on the gravitational wave signal
is not only undetectable by the next generation of gravitational wave
detectors, but also too small to be measured in the numerical simulations: even
the plunge, merger and ringdown signals appear in perfect agreement for both
types of binaries. The characteristics of the post-merger remnants are equally
similar, with the masses of the final black holes agreeing within dM< 5
10^{-4}M_BH and their spins within da< 10^{-3}M_BH. The rate of periastron
advance in the mixed binary agrees with previously published binary black hole
results, and we use the inspiral waveforms to place constraints on the accuracy
of our numerical simulations independent of algorithmic choices made for each
type of binary. Overall, our results indicate that non-disrupting neutron
star-black hole mergers are exceptionally well modeled by black hole-black hole
mergers, and that given the absence of mass ejection, accretion disk formation,
or differences in the gravitational wave signals, only electromagnetic
precursors could prove the presence of a neutron star in low-spin systems of
total mass ~10Msun, at least until the advent of gravitational wave detectors
with a sensitivity comparable to that of the proposed Einstein Telescope.

this result by studying the dissipation of dislocation motion as a function of

stars. In order to perform such study we first calculate the structure of
rotating objects, which is considerably more complicated than that of spherical
objects. The structure of rotating neutron stars is obtained by solving
Einstein's equation for a rotationally deformed fluid distributions. The
numerical method used is based on the the KEH. The equation of state used for
computing the neutron star structure and composition is a simple relativistic
mean field model, with parameter set G300. With the structure of rotating
neutron stars computed we calculate the thermal evolution of these objects. In
order to do so, we re-derive the thermal evolution equations to account for the
metric of a rotating object. The cooling of neutron stars with different
frequencies is then calculated. We show that the cooling of the star strongly
depends on the frequency of the object, with higher frequencies stars showing a
substantial temperature difference between the equator and poles.

that, in CNS neurons, ultrasound-induced cavitation of these nanometric bilayer

that other interactions between the nervous system and pressure waves or

afterglows are presently sparse in the time/frequency domain. Starting from a
complete sample of 58 bright Swift long bursts (BAT6), we constructed a
homogeneous sub-sample of 38 radio detections/upper limits which preserves all
the properties of the parent sample. One half of the bursts have detections
between 1 and 5 days after the explosion with typical fluxes F>100 muJy at 8.4
GHz. Through a Population SYnthesis Code coupled with the standard afterglow
Hydrodynamical Emission model (PSYCHE) we reproduce the radio flux distribution
of the radio sub-sample. Based on these results we study the detectability in
the time/frequency domain of the entire long GRB population by present and
future radio facilities. We find that the GRBs that typically trigger Swift can
be detected at 8.4 GHz by JVLA within few days with modest exposures even at
high redshifts. The final SKA can potentially observe the whole GRB population
provided that there will be a dedicated GRB gamma-ray detector more sensitive
than Swift. For a sizable fraction (50%) of these bursts, SKA will allow us to
perform radio-calorimetry, after the trans-relativistic transition (occurring

two-component structure well-fit by a sum of Sersic functions, with an
elliptical, compact (r_h=14 pc; n ~ 3.3) inner component and a round,
exponential, extended (r_h=49 pc) outer component. Chandra data reveal a
variable central X-ray source with L_X ~ 10^38 erg/s that could be an active
galactic nucleus associated with a massive black hole or a low-mass X-ray
binary. Analysis of optical spectroscopy shows the object to be old (~> 10 Gyr)
and of solar metallicity, with elevated [Mg/Fe] and strongly enhanced [N/Fe]

generically present in dense stellar systems. The velocity dispersion (~ 70
km/s) and resulting dynamical mass-to-light ratio (M/L_V=4.9 +/- 0.7) are
consistent with---but slightly higher than---expectations for an old,
metal-rich stellar population with a Kroupa initial mass function. The presence
of a massive black hole or a mild increase in low-mass stars or stellar
remnants is therefore also consistent with this M/L_V. The stellar density of
the galaxy is so high that no dynamical signature of dark matter is expected.

predict that some FRBs can accompany type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) or X-ray

stimulate nuclear star formation. However, there is no compelling evidence on
whether they also feed a central supermassive black hole: by measuring the
fractions of barred active and inactive galaxies, previous studies have yielded
conflicting results. In this paper, we aim to understand the lack of
observational evidence for bar-driven active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity by
studying a sample of 41 nearby (d < 35 Mpc) barred galaxies from the Spitzer
Survey for Stellar Structure in Galaxies. We use Chandra observations to
measure nuclear 2--10 keV X-ray luminosities and estimate Eddington ratios,
together with Spitzer 3.6um imaging to quantify the strength of the stellar bar
in two independent ways: (1) from its structure, as traced by its ellipticity
and boxiness, and (2) from its gravitational torque Q_b, taken as the maximum
ratio of the tangential force to the mean background radial force. In this way,
rather than discretizing the presence of both stellar bars and nuclear
activity, we are able to account for the continuum of bar strengths and degrees
of AGN activity. We find nuclear X-ray sources in 31 out of 41 galaxies with
median X-ray luminosity and Eddington ratio of L_X=4.3x10^{38} erg/s and
L_bol/L_Edd=6.9x10^{-6} respectively, consistent with low-luminosity AGN
activity. Including upper limits for those galaxies without nuclear detections,
we find no significant correlation between any of the bar strength indicators
and the degree of nuclear activity, irrespective of galaxy luminosity, stellar
mass, Hubble type, or bulge size. Strong bars do not favor brighter or more
efficient nuclear activity, implying that at least for the low-luminosity
regime, supermassive black hole fueling is not closely connected to large scale
features.

attenuation corrections from Balmer decrements, we find that 4 of these
low-mass galaxies are extremely metal-poor with 12+log(O/H) <= 7.65 or
one-tenth solar. Our most metal-deficient galaxy has 12+log(O/H) =
7.24^{+0.45}_{-0.30} (95% confidence), similar to some of the lowest
metallicity galaxies identified in the local universe. We find that our
galaxies are all undergoing significant star formation with average specific
star formation rate (SFR) of (100 Myr)^{-1}, and that they have high central
SFR surface densities (average of 0.5 Msun/yr/kpc^2. In addition, more than
two-thirds of our galaxies have between one and four nearby companions within a
projected radius of 100 kpc, which we find is an excess among star-forming
galaxies at z=0.4-0.85. We also find that the gas-phase metallicities for a
given stellar mass and SFR lie systematically below the local M-Z-(SFR)
relation by \approx0.2 dex (2\sigma\ significance). These results are partly
due to selection effects, since galaxies with strong star formation and low
metallicity are more likely to yield [OIII]4363 detections. Finally, the
observed higher ionization parameter and electron density suggest that they are
lower redshift analogs to typical z>1 galaxies.

Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxy WPVS 007. The galaxy was monitored with Swift between
October 2005 and July 2013, after it had undergone a dramatic drop in its X-ray
flux earlier. For the first time, we are able to repeatedly detect this NLS1 in
X-rays again. This increased number of detections in the last couple of years
may suggest that the strong absorber that has been found in this AGN is
starting to become leaky, and may eventually disappear. The X-ray spectra
obtained for WPVS 007 are all consistent with a partial covering absorber
model. A spectrum based on the data during the extreme low X-ray flux states
shows that the absorption column density is of the order of 4 x 10^23 cm^-2
with a covering fraction of 95%. WPVS 007 also displays one of the strongest UV
variabilities seen in Narrow Line Seyfert 1s. The UV continuum variability
anti-correlates with the optical/UV slope alpha-UV which suggests that the
variability primarily may be due to reddening. The UV variability time scales
are consistent with moving dust `clouds' located beyond the dust sublimation
radius of approximately 20 ld. We present for the first time near infrared JHK
data of WPVS 007, which reveal a rich emission-line spectrum. Recent optical
spectroscopy does not indicate significant variability in the broad and FeII
emission lines, implying that the ionizing continuum seen by those gas clouds
has not significantly changed over the last decades. All X-ray and UV
observations are consistent with a scenario in which an evolving Broad
Absorption Line (BAL) flow obscures the continuum emission. As such, WPVS 007
is an important target for our understanding of BAL flows in low-mass active
galactic nuclei (AGN).

we restrict ourselves to the standard six parameter model of flat $\Lambda$CDM.
This tension has two parts. First, the Planck satellite data suggest a higher
normalization of matter perturbations than local measurements of galaxy
clusters. Second, the expansion rate of the Universe today, $H_0$, derived from
local distance-redshift measurements is significantly higher than that inferred
using the acoustic scale in galaxy surveys and the Planck data as a standard
ruler. The addition of a sterile neutrino species changes the acoustic scale
and brings the two into agreement; meanwhile, adding mass to the active
neutrinos or to a sterile neutrino can suppress the growth of structure,
bringing the cluster data into better concordance as well. For our fiducial
dataset combination, with statistical errors for clusters, a model with a
massive sterile neutrino shows 3.5$\sigma$ evidence for a non-zero mass and an
even stronger rejection of the minimal model. A model with massive active

major source of error in the determination of source spectra. In order to
decrease reliance on accurate beam calibration, we focus on calibrating sources

restriction greatly reduces errors associated with beam calibration, yielding a
dramatic improvement in the accuracy of derived source spectra. Extrapolating
from higher frequency catalogs, we derive the flux scale using a Monte-Carlo
fit across multiple sources that includes uncertainty from both catalog and
measurement errors. Fitting spectral models to catalog data and these new PAPER
measurements, we derive new flux models for Pictor A and 31 other sources at
nearby declinations. 90% of these confirm and refine a power-law model for flux
density. Of note is the new Pictor A flux model, which is accurate to 1.4% and
shows, in contrast to previous models, that between 100 MHz and 2 GHz, the
spectrum of Pictor A is consistent with a single power law given by a flux at
150 MHz of 382+/-5.4 Jy, and a spectral index of -0.76+/-0.01. This accuracy
represents an order of magnitude improvement over previous measurements in this

estimate the absolute flux scale. The simplicity and improved accuracy of
Pictor A's spectrum make it an excellent calibrator for experiments seeking to

block entropies and determine its universal aspects in the ground state of
critical and noncritical one-dimensional quantum spin models. In all cases, the
scaling exhibits an oscillatory behavior that terminates at the factorization
point and whose frequency is universal. Parity effects in the scaling of the
R\'enyi entropies for gapless models at zero field are thus shown to be a
particular case of such universal behavior. Likewise, the absence of
oscillations for the Ising chain in transverse field is due to the vanishing
value of the factorizing field for this particular model. In general, the
transition occurring at the factorizing field between two different scaling
regimes of the entanglement spectrum corresponds to a quantum transition to the
formation of finite-range, ordered structures of quasi-dimers, quasi-trimers,
and quasi-polymers. This entanglement-driven transition is superimposed to and
independent of the long-range magnetic order in the broken symmetry phase.
Therefore, it conforms to recent generalizations that identify and classify the
quantum phases of matter according to the structure of ground-state
entanglement patterns. We characterize this form of quantum order by a global
order parameter of entanglement defined as the integral, over blocks of all
lengths, of the R\'enyi entropy of infinite order. Equivalently, it can be
defined as the integral of the bipartite single-copy or geometric entanglement.
The global entanglement order parameter remains always finite at fields below
the factorization point and vanishes identically above it.

One subclass of human computation applications are those directed at tasks that
involve planning (e.g. travel planning) and scheduling (e.g. conference
scheduling). Much of this work appears outside the traditional automated
planning forums, and at the outset it is not clear whether automated planning
has much of a role to play in these human computation systems. Interestingly
however, work on these systems shows that even primitive forms of automated
oversight of the human planner does help in significantly improving the
effectiveness of the humans/crowd. In this paper, we will argue that the
automated oversight used in these systems can be viewed as a primitive
automated planner, and that there are several opportunities for more
sophisticated automated planning in effectively steering crowdsourced planning.
Straightforward adaptation of current planning technology is however hampered
by the mismatch between the capabilities of human workers and automated
planners. We identify two important challenges that need to be overcome before
such adaptation of planning technology can occur: (i) interpreting the inputs
of the human workers (and the requester) and (ii) steering or critiquing the
plans being produced by the human workers armed only with incomplete domain and
preference models. In this paper, we discuss approaches for handling these
challenges, and characterize existing human computation systems in terms of the

the analysis of GPCA and also has interest in its own right. We provide

bound with similar bounds obtained by CMS using simplified models. The bottom
line is that the bounds coming from the same sign di-lepton analysis are
comparable for our model and the simplified model studied assuming BR(gluino ->

analyses for our model are 10 - 20% lower than obtained for the simplified

decay gluino -> g neutralino is significant. Thus there are significantly fewer
b-jets. We find a lower bound on the gluino mass in our models with M_{gluino}

heavy-quark and large $N_c$ limits of QCD. Witten's classic argument that
baryons and interacting systems of baryons can be described in a mean-field
approximation with each of the quarks moving in an average potential due to the
remaining quarks is heuristic. It is important to justify this heuristic
description for the case of baryonic matter since systems of interacting
baryons are intrinsically more complicated than single baryons due to the
possibility of hidden color states---states in which the subsystems making up
the entire baryon crystal are not color-singlet nucleons but rather colorful
states coupled together to make a color-singlet state. In this work, we provide
a formal justification of this heuristic prescription. In order to do this, we
start by taking the heavy quark limit, thus effectively reducing the problem to
a many-body quantum mechanical system. This problem can be formulated in terms
of integrals over coherent states, which for this problem are simple Slater
determinants. We show that for the many-body problem, the support region for
these integrals becomes narrow at large $N_c$, yielding an energy which is
well-approximated by a single coherent state---that is a mean-field
description. Corrections to the energy are of relative order $1/N_c$. While
hidden color states are present in the exact state of the heavy quark system,
they only influence the interaction energy at sub-leading order in $1/N_{c}$.

that at which the electron bound state with the lowest energy reaches the

WDs) is crucial for understanding type Ia supernova (SN Ia) from the
single-degenerate model, but this process has not been well understood due to
the numerical difficulties in treating H and He flashes during the accretion.
For the CO WD masses from 0.5 to $1.378\,{M}_\odot$ and accretion rates in the
range from $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-5}\,{M}_\odot\,\mbox{yr}^{-1}$, we simulated the
accretion of solar-composition material onto CO WDs using the state-of-the-art
stellar evolution code of {\sc MESA}. For comparison with the steady-state
models (e.g \citet{nskh07}), we firstly ignored the contribution from nuclear
burning to the luminosity when determining the Eddington accretion rate and
found that the properties of H burning in our accreting CO WD models are
similar to those from the steady-state models, except that the critical
accretion rates at which the WDs turn into red giants or H-shell flashes occur
on their surfaces are slightly higher than those from the steady-state models.
However, the super-Eddington wind is triggered at much lower accretion rates,
than previously thought, when the contribution of nuclear burning to the total
luminosity is included. This super-Eddington wind naturally prevents the CO WDs
with high accretion rates from becoming red giants, thus presenting an
alternative to the optically thick wind proposed by \cite{hkn96}. Furthermore,
the super-Eddington wind works in low-metallicity environments, which may
explain SNe Ia observed at high redshifts.

Hamiltonians of arbitrary spin $S$. The generalization consists of an extension

excitations are waves of the local order parameter that fluctuates in the
SU($N$) space of unitary transformations of the local spin states, instead of
the SU(2) space of local spin rotations. Since the generators of the SU($N$)
group can be represented as bilinear forms in $N$-flavored bosons, the
low-energy modes of the GSWT are described with $N-1$ different bosons. The
generalization allows treating quantum spin systems whose ground state exhibit
multipolar ordering as well as detecting instabilities of magnetically ordered
states (dipolar ordering) towards higher multipolar orderings. We illustrate
these advantages by applying the GSWT to a bilinear-biquadratic model of
arbitrary spin $S$ on hypercubic lattices.

the level of triples for Markovian SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) dynamics
on tree-like networks. This resulted in a deterministic representation of the
epidemic dynamics on the network that can be numerically evaluated. In this
paper, we extend this modelling framework to certain classes of networks
exhibiting loops. We show that closures where the loops are kept intact are
exact, and lead to a simplified and numerically solvable system of ODEs
(ordinary-differential-equations). The findings of the paper lead us to a
generalisation of closures that are based on partitioning the network around
nodes that are cut-vertices (i.e. the removal of such a node leads to the
network breaking down into at least two disjointed components or subnetworks).
Exploiting this structural property of the network yields some natural
closures, where the evolution of a particular state can typically be exactly
given in terms of the corresponding or projected sates on the subnetworks and
the cut-vertex. A byproduct of this analysis is an alternative probabilistic
proof of the exactness of the closures for tree-like networks presented in
Sharkey et al. [13]. In this paper we also elaborate on how the main result can
be applied to more realistic networks, for which we write down the ODEs
explicitly and compare output from these to results from simulation.
Furthermore, we give a general, recipe-like method of how to apply the
reduction by closures technique for arbitrary networks, and give an upper bound
on the maximum number of equations needed for an exact representation.

beyond the singularity, ""whiskers"", containing timelike and lightlike closed
curves, which at first sight seem unphysical. The spacetime includes the usual
AdS-asymptotic boundaries outside the horizons as well as boundary components
inside the whiskers. We show that local boundary correlators with some
endpoints in the whisker regions: (i) are a protected class of amplitudes,
dominated by effective field theory even when the associated Witten diagrams
appear to traverse the singularity, (ii) describe well-defined
diffeomorphism-invariant quantum gravity amplitudes in BTZ, (iii) sharply probe
some of the physics inside the horizon but outside the singularity, and (iv)
are equivalent to correlators of specific non-local CFT operators in the
standard thermofield entangled state of two CFTs. In this sense, the whisker
regions can be considered as purely auxiliary spacetimes in which these useful
non-local CFT correlators can be rendered as local boundary correlators, and
their diagnostic value more readily understood. Our results follow by first
performing a novel reanalysis of the Rindler view of standard AdS/CFT duality
on the Poincare patch of AdS, followed by exploiting the simple quotient
structure of BTZ which turns the Rindler horizon into the BTZ black hole
horizon. While most of our checks are within gravitational effective field

non-Markovian dynamical maps to extract this information from the initial
trajectories and compress it into non-Markovian transfer tensors. Assuming

efficiently propagate the state of the system to arbitrarily long timescales.
The non-Markovian Transfer Tensor Method (TTM) demonstrates the
coherent-to-incoherent transition as a function of the strength of quantum
dissipation and predicts the non-canonical equilibrium distribution due to the
system-bath entanglement. TTM is equivalent to solving the Nakajima-Zwanzig
equation, and therefore can be used to reconstruct the dynamical operators (the
system Hamiltonian and memory kernel) from quantum trajectories obtained in
simulations or experiments. The concept underlying the approach can be
generalized to physical observables with the goal of learning and manipulating

this assumption is a straightforward consequence of time-symmetry, given an
understanding of the quantization of light that would have seemed natural to
Einstein after 1905. The new argument shows precisely why quantization makes a
difference, and why time-symmetry alone does not imply retrocausality, in the
classical context. It is true that later developments in quantum theory provide
a way to avoid retrocausality, without violating time-symmetry; but this escape
route relies on the ""ontic"" conception of the wave function that Einstein
rejected. Had this new argument been noticed much sooner, then, it seems likely
that retrocausality would have been regarded as the default option for hidden
variables theories (a fact that would then have seemed confirmed by Bell's
Theorem and the No Hidden Variable theorems). This paper presents these ideas
at a level intended to be accessible to general readers.

to external perturbations. As such, they offer a unique view of the nucleus
that is often not accessible otherwise. Although interesting in their own
right, giant resonances are also enormously valuable in providing stringent
constraints on the equation of state of asymmetric matter. We this view in
mind, we focus on two modes of excitation that are essential in reaching this
goal: the isoscalar giant monopole resonance (GMR) and the isovector giant
dipole resonance (GDR). GMR energies in heavy nuclei are sensitive to the
symmetry energy because they probe the incompressibility of neutron-rich
matter. Unfortunately, access to the symmetry energy is hindered by the
relatively low neutron-proton asymmetry of stable nuclei. Thus, the measurement
of GMR energies in exotic nuclei is strongly encouraged. In the case of the
GDR, we find the electric dipole polarizability of paramount importance.
Indeed, the electric dipole polarizability appears as one of two laboratory
observables -- with the neutron-skin thickness being the other -- that are
highly sensitive to the density dependence of the symmetry energy. Finally, we
identify the softness of skin and the nature of the pygmy resonance as
important unsolved problems in nuclear structure.

  In this paper, we introduce a new framework that generalizes critical point
cancellations in scalar functions to Jacobi sets in two dimensions. We focus on
simplifications that can be realized by smooth approximations of the

contiguous subsets of the Jacobi set. These extended cancellations form the
atomic operations in our framework, and we introduce an algorithm to
successively cancel subsets of the Jacobi set with minimal modifications

spectra and direct data pattern analysis reveal a clear signature of the
1.09-year Earth-Jupiter conjunction cycle, in particular during solar cycle 23
maximum. This appears to suggest that the Jupiter side of the Sun is slightly
brighter during solar maxima. The effect is observed when the Earth crosses the
Sun-Jupiter conjunction line every 1.09 years. Multiple spectral peaks are
observed in the TSI records that are coherent with known planetary harmonics
such as the spring, orbital and synodic periods among Mercury, Venus, Earth and
Jupiter: the Mercury-Venus spring-tidal cycle (0.20 year); the Mercury orbital
cycle (0.24 year); the Venus-Jupiter spring-tidal cycle (0.32 year); the
Venus-Mercury synodic cycle (0.40 year); the Venus-Jupiter synodic cycle (0.65
year); and the Venus-Earth spring tidal cycle (0.80 year). Strong evidence is
also found for a 0.5-year TSI cycle that could be driven by the Earth's
crossing the solar equatorial plane twice a year and may indicate a latitudinal
solar-luminosity asymmetry. Because both spring and synodic planetary cycles
appear to be present and the amplitudes of their TSI signatures appear enhanced
during sunspot cycle maxima, we conjecture that on annual and sub-annual scales
both gravitational and electro-magnetic planet-sun interactions and internal
non-linear feedbacks may be modulating solar activity. Gravitational tidal
forces should mostly stress spring cycles while electro-magnetic forces could
be linked to the solar wobbling dynamics, and would mostly stress the synodic

this paper, we propose to seek aid from the demand side (i.e., electricity

appliances, we present a new appliance-driven approach to load curve data
cleansing. This approach utilizes data generation rules and a Sequential Local

cleansing methods, such as B-spline smoothing, our approach has an overall
better performance and can effectively identify consecutive corrupted data.
Experimental results also demonstrate that our method is robust in various

subtle allele frequencies shifts at many loci. Current population genomic
techniques are not well posed to identify such signals. In the past decade,
detailed knowledge about the specific loci underlying polygenic traits has
begun to emerge from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here we combine
this knowledge from GWAS with robust population genetic modeling to identify
traits that may have been influenced by local adaptation. We exploit the fact
that GWAS provide an estimate of the additive effect size of many loci to
estimate the mean additive genetic value for a given phenotype across many
populations as simple weighted sums of allele frequencies. We first describe a
general model of neutral genetic value drift for an arbitrary number of
populations with an arbitrary relatedness structure. Based on this model we
develop methods for detecting unusually strong correlations between genetic
values and specific environmental variables, as well as a generalization of
$Q_{ST}/F_{ST}$ comparisons to test for over-dispersion of genetic values among
populations. Finally we lay out a framework to identify the individual
populations or groups of populations that contribute to the signal of
overdispersion. These tests have considerably greater power than their single
locus equivalents due to the fact that they look for positive covariance
between like effect alleles, and also significantly outperform methods that do
not account for population structure. We apply our tests to the Human Genome
Diversity Panel (HGDP) dataset using GWAS data for height, skin pigmentation,

Riemannian geometry of inference theory. This theory describes the geometric
features of the statistical manifold $\mathcal{M}$ of random events that are
described by a family of continuous distributions $dp(x|\theta)$. A main goal
of this work is to clarify the statistical relevance of Levi-Civita curvature
tensor $R_{ijkl}(x|\theta)$ of the statistical manifold $\mathcal{M}$. For this
purpose, the notion of \emph{irreducible statistical correlations} is
introduced. Specifically, a distribution $dp(x|\theta)$ exhibits irreducible
statistical correlations if every distribution $dp(\check{x}|\theta)$ obtained
from $dp(x|\theta)$ by considering a coordinate change $\check{x}=\phi(x)$
cannot be factorized into independent distributions as
$dp(\check{x}|\theta)=\prod_{i}dp^{(i)}(\check{x}^{i}|\theta)$. It is shown
that the curvature tensor $R_{ijkl}(x|\theta)$ arises as a direct indicator
about the existence of irreducible statistical correlations. Moreover, the
curvature scalar $R(x|\theta)$ allows to introduce a criterium for the
applicability of the \emph{gaussian approximation} of a given distribution
function. This type of asymptotic result is obtained in the framework of the
second-order geometric expansion of the distributions family $dp(x|\theta)$,
which appears as a counterpart development of the high-order asymptotic theory
of statistical estimation. In physics, fluctuation geometry represents the
mathematical apparatus of a Riemannian extension for Einstein's fluctuation
theory of statistical mechanics. Some exact results of fluctuation geometry are
now employed to derive the \emph{invariant fluctuation theorems}.

Andreev bound states giving rise to a current phase relation that deviates from
sinusoidal behaviour. Of particular interest are zero energy Majorana bound
states that form at a phase difference of $\pi$. Here we report on
interferometry studies of Josephson junctions and superconducting quantum
interference devices (SQUIDs) incorporating topological insulator weak links.
We find that the nodes in single junction diffraction patterns and SQUID
oscillations are lifted and independent of chemical potential. At high
temperatures, the SQUID oscillations revert to conventional behaviour, ruling
out asymmetry. The node lifting of the SQUID oscillations is consistent with
low energy Andreev bound states exhibiting a nonsinusoidal current phase
relation, coexisting with states possessing a conventional sinusoidal current
phase relation. However, the finite nodal currents in the single junction
diffraction pattern suggest an anomalous contribution to the supercurrent
possibly carried by Majorana bound states, although we also consider the
possibility of inhomogeneity.

rich, optically bright Eastern tail and an HI-rich, optically faint Western
tail. Non-detection of CO in the Western Tail by Braine et al. (2001) suggested
that star formation had not yet begun. However, deep UBVR and H-alpha
narrowband images show evidence of recent star formation in the Western tail,
though it lacks massive star clusters and cluster complexes. Using Herschel
PACS spectroscopy, we discover 158 micron [CII] emission at the location of the
three most luminous H-alpha sources in the Eastern tail, but not at the
location of the even brighter H-alpha source in the Western tail. The Western
tail is found to have a normal star formation efficiency (SFE), but the Eastern
tail has a low SFE. The lack of CO and [CII] emission suggests the Western tail
HII region may have a low carbon abundance and be undergoing its first star
formation. The Western tail is more efficient at forming stars, but lacks
massive clusters. We propose that the low SFE in the Eastern tail may be due to
its formation as a splash region where gas heating is important even though it
has sufficient molecular and neutral gas to make massive star clusters. The
Western tail, which has lower gas surface density and does not form high mass
star clusters, is a tidally formed region where gravitational compression
likely enhances star formation.

attributed to dissipation of Alfv\'en waves that transport energy and potential
downward to an acceleration region near the chromosphere. The acceleration
involves the parallel electric field that develops in the limit of inertial
Alfv\'en waves (IAWs). A two-potential model for IAWs is used to relate the
parallel potential to the cross-field potential transported by the waves. We
identify a maximum parallel potential in terms of a maximum current density
that corresponds to the threshold for the onset of anomalous resistivity. This
maximum is of order $10\,$kV when the threshold is that for the Buneman
instability. We argue that this restricts the cross-field potential in an
Alfv\'en wave to about $10\,$kV. Effective dissipation requires a large number
of up- and down-current paths associated with multiple Alfv\'en waves. The
electron acceleration occurs in localized, transient, anomalously-conducting
regions (LTACRs) and is associated with the parallel electric field determined
by Ohm's law with an anomalous resistivity. We introduce an idealized model in
which the LTACRs are (upward-)current sheets, a few skin depths in thickness,
separated by much-larger regions of weaker return current. We show that this
model can account semi-quantitatively for bulk energization.

optimal transportation problem, is concerned with transporting one probability
density $f \in L^1(\mathbb{R}^m)$ onto another one $g \in L^1(\mathbb{R}^n)$ so
as to optimize a cost function $c \in L^1(\mathbb{R}^{m+n})$ while respecting
the capacity constraints $0\le h \le \bar h\in L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^{m+n})$.
  A linear programming duality theorem for this problem was first established

existence of a pair of $L^1$-functions optimizing the dual problem. Using these
functions, which can be viewed as Lagrange multipliers to the marginal
constraints $f$ and $g$, we characterize the solution $h$ of the primal
problem. We expect these potentials to play a key role in any further analysis
of $h$.
  Moreover, starting from Levin's duality, we derive the classical Kantorovich
duality for unconstrained optimal transport. In tandem with results obtained in
our companion paper (arXiv:1309.3022), this amounts to a new and elementary

resonances using numerical simulations with a wide range of various parameters.
In particular, we focus on deriving the critical migration timescale for
capture into the 2:1 resonance; additional numerical experiments for closely
spaced resonances (e.g., 3:2) are also performed. We find that the critical
migration timescale is determined by the planet-to-stellar mass ratio, and its
dependence exhibits power-law behavior with index -4/3. This dependence is also
supported by simple analytic arguments. We also find that the critical
migration timescale for systems with equal-mass bodies is shorter than that in
the restricted problem; for instance, for the 2:1 resonance between two
equal-mass bodies, the critical timescale decreases by a factor of 10. In
addition, using the obtained formula, the origin of observed systems that
include first-order commensurabilities is constrained. Assuming that pairs of
planets originally form well separated from each other and then undergo
convergent migration and are captured in resonances, it is possible that a
number of exoplanets experienced rapid orbital migration. For systems in
closely spaced resonances, the differential migration timescale between the
resonant pair can be constrained well; it is further suggested that several
exoplanets underwent migration that can equal or even exceed the type I
migration rate predicted by the linear theory. This implies that some of them
may have formed in situ. Future observations and the use of our model will
allow us to statistically determine the typical migration speed in a
protoplanetary disk.

based on Cepheids, one must first be aware of important effects of the
corotation resonance, situated a little beyond the solar orbit. The thin disk
of the Galaxy is divided in two regions that are separated by a barrier
situated at that radius. Since the gas cannot get across that barrier, the
chemical evolution is independent on the two sides of it. The barrier is caused
by the opposite directions of flows of gas, on the two sides, in addition to a
Cassini-like ring void of HI (caused itself by the flows). A step in the
metallicity gradient developed at corotation, due to the difference in the
average star formation rate on the two sides, and to this lack of communication
between them. In connection with this, a proof that the spiral arms of our
Galaxy are long-lived (a few billion years) is the existence of this step. When
one studies the abundance gradients by means of stars which span a range of
ages, like the Cepheids, one has to take into account that stars, contrary to
the gas, have the possibility of crossing the corotation barrier. A few stars
born on the high metallicity side are seen on the low metallicity one, and
vice-versa. In the present work we re-discuss the data on Barium abundance in
Cepheids as a function of Galactic radius, taking into account the scenario
described above. The [Ba/H] ratio, plotted as a function of Galactic radius,
apparently presents a distribution with two branches in the external region
(beyond corotation). One can re-interpret the data and attribute the upper
branch to the stars that were born on the high metallicity side. The lower
branch, analyzed separately, indicates that the stars born beyond corotation
have a rising Barium metallicity as a function of Galactic radius.

  contrasts of mixed effects","17 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The detection of differentially expressed (DE) genes is one of the most
commonly studied problems in bioinformatics. For example, the identification of
DE genes between distinct disease phenotypes is an important first step in
understanding and developing treatment drugs for the disease. It can also
contribute significantly to the construction of a discriminant rule for
predicting the class of origin of an unclassified tissue sample from a patient.
We present a novel approach to the problem of detecting DE genes that is based
on a test statistic formed as a weighted (normalized) cluster-specific contrast
in the mixed effects of the mixture model used in the first instance to cluster
the gene profiles into a manageable number of clusters. The key factor in the
formation of our test statistic is the use of gene-specific mixed effects in
the cluster-specific contrast. It thus means that the (soft) assignment of a
given gene to a cluster is not crucial. This is because in addition to class
differences between the (estimated) fixed effects terms for a cluster,
gene-specific class differences also contribute to the cluster-specific
contributions to the final form of the test statistic. The proposed test
statistic can be used where the primary aim is to rank the genes in order of
evidence against the null hypothesis of no DE. We also show how a P-value can
be calculated for each gene for use in multiple hypothesis testing where the
intent is to control the false discovery rate (FDR) at some desired level. With
the use of real and simulated data sets, we show that the proposed
contrast-based approach outperforms other methods commonly used for the
detection of DE genes both in a ranking context with lower proportion of false
discoveries and in a multiple hypothesis testing context with higher power for
a specified level of the FDR.

  Chains Self-organized in Recurrent Neural Networks",,,"10.1103/PhysRevE.88.062716",,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Synfire chains are thought to underlie precisely-timed sequences of spikes
observed in various brain regions and across species. How they are formed is
not understood. Here we analyze self-organization of synfire chains through the
spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) of the synapses, axon remodeling, and
potentiation decay of synaptic weights in networks of neurons driven by noisy
external inputs and subject to dominant feedback inhibition. Potentiation decay
is the gradual, activity-independent reduction of synaptic weights over time.
We show that potentiation decay enables a dynamic and statistically stable
network connectivity when neurons spike spontaneously. Periodic stimulation of
a subset of neurons leads to formation of synfire chains through a random
recruitment process, which terminates when the chain connects to itself and
forms a loop. We demonstrate that chain length distributions depend on the
potentiation decay. Fast potentiation decay leads to long chains with wide
distributions, while slow potentiation decay leads to short chains with narrow
distributions. We suggest that the potentiation decay, which corresponds to the
decay of early long-term potentiation of synapses (E-LTP), is an important
synaptic plasticity rule in regulating formation of neural circuity through
STDP.

a single location. However, it has been shown that proteins localize to
multiple locations. While a few recent systems have attempted to predict
multiple locations of proteins, they typically treat locations as independent
or capture inter-dependencies by treating each locations-combination present in
the training set as an individual location-class. We present a new method and a
preliminary system we have developed that directly incorporates
inter-dependencies among locations into the multiple-location-prediction
process, using a collection of Bayesian network classifiers. We evaluate our
system on a dataset of single- and multi-localized proteins. Our results,
obtained by incorporating inter-dependencies are significantly higher than

performance of our system on multi-localized proteins is comparable to a top

to probe into and quantify the dynamics of human interest. Using three
prototypical ""big data"" sets, we investigate the scaling behaviors associated
with human-interest dynamics. In particular, from the data sets we uncover
power-law scaling associated with the three basic quantities: (1) the length of
continuous interest, (2) the return time of visiting certain interest, and (3)
interest ranking and transition. We argue that there are three basic
ingredients underlying human-interest dynamics: preferential return to
previously visited interests, inertial effect, and exploration of new

current structure alignment algorithms is in their inherent design, which is
based on local structure similarity. In this work, we propose a method to
incorporate global information in obtaining optimal alignments and
superpositions. Our method, when applied to optimizing the TM-score and the GDT
score, produces significantly better results than current state-of-the-art
protein structure alignment tools. Specifically, if the highest TM-score found
by TMalign is lower than (0.6) and the highest TM-score found by one of the
tested methods is higher than (0.5), there is a probability of (42%) that
TMalign failed to find TM-scores higher than (0.5), while the same probability
is reduced to (2%) if our method is used. This could significantly improve the
accuracy of fold detection if the cutoff TM-score of (0.5) is used.
  In addition, existing structure alignment algorithms focus on structure
similarity alone and simply ignore other important similarities, such as
sequence similarity. Our approach has the capacity to incorporate multiple
similarities into the scoring function. Results show that sequence similarity
aids in finding high quality protein structure alignments that are more
consistent with eye-examined alignments in HOMSTRAD. Even when structure
similarity itself fails to find alignments with any consistency with
eye-examined alignments, our method remains capable of finding alignments
highly similar to, or even identical to, eye-examined alignments.

has access to certain statistics of the ground truth. For instance, in image
segmentation, the area and boundary length of the object may be known. In these
cases, we want to estimate the most probable solution that is consistent with
such statistics, i.e., satisfies certain equality or inequality constraints.

is usually solved using Linear Programming formulations, which relax the

underlies a process of interest from a genome-wide screen of associated genes.
Despite intense work in this area, current algorithmic approaches are largely
limited to analyzing a single screen and are, thus, unable to account for
information on condition-specific genes, or reveal the dynamics (over time or
condition) of the process in question. Here we propose a novel formulation for
network reconstruction from multiple-condition data and devise an efficient
integer program solution for it. We apply our algorithm to analyze the response
to influenza infection in humans over time as well as to analyze a pair of ER
export related screens in humans. By comparing to an extant, single-condition
tool we demonstrate the power of our new approach in integrating data from
multiple conditions in a compact and coherent manner, capturing the dynamics of
the underlying processes.

transit systems, as it can significantly enhance railway network efficiency,
safety and capacity. Since CBTC systems are mostly deployed in underground
tunnels and trains move in high speed, building a train-ground wireless
communication system for CBTC is a challenging task. Modeling the tunnel
channels is very important to design and evaluate the performance of CBTC
systems. Most of existing works on channel modeling do not consider the unique
characteristics in CBTC systems, such as high mobility speed, deterministic
moving direction, and accurate train location information. In this paper, we
develop a finite state Markov channel (FSMC) model for tunnel channels in CBTC
systems. The proposed FSMC model is based on real field CBTC channel
measurements obtained from a business operating subway line. Unlike most
existing channel models, which are not related to specific locations, the
proposed FSMC channel model takes train locations into account to have a more
accurate channel model. The distance between the transmitter and the receiver
is divided into intervals, and an FSMC model is applied in each interval. The
accuracy of the proposed FSMC model is illustrated by the simulation results
generated from the model and the real field measurement results.

generating and executing possible attacks. Doing so automatically allows for
regular and systematic testing. A key question then is how to automatically
generate the attacks. A natural way to address this issue is as an attack
planning problem. In this thesis, we are concerned with the specific context of
regular automated pentesting, and use the term ""attack planning"" in that sense.
The following three research directions are investigated.
  First, we introduce a conceptual model of computer network attacks, based on
an analysis of the penetration testing practices. We study how this attack
model can be represented in the PDDL language. Then we describe an
implementation that integrates a classical planner with a penetration testing
tool. This allows us to automatically generate attack paths for real world
pentesting scenarios, and to validate these attacks by executing them.
  Secondly, we present efficient probabilistic planning algorithms,
specifically designed for this problem, that achieve industrial-scale runtime
performance (able to solve scenarios with several hundred hosts and exploits).
These algorithms take into account the probability of success of the actions
and their expected cost (for example in terms of execution time, or network
traffic generated).
  Finally, we take a different direction: instead of trying to improve the
efficiency of the solutions developed, we focus on improving the model of the
attacker. We model the attack planning problem in terms of partially observable
Markov decision processes (POMDP). This grounds penetration testing in a
well-researched formalism. POMDPs allow the modelling of information gathering
as an integral part of the problem, thus providing for the first time a means
to intelligently mix scanning actions with actual exploits.

under incomplete knowledge about the network configuration. Previous work uses
classical planning, and requires costly pre-processes reducing this uncertainty
by extensive application of scanning methods. By contrast, we herein model the
attack planning problem in terms of partially observable Markov decision
processes (POMDP). This allows to reason about the knowledge available, and to
intelligently employ scanning actions as part of the attack. As one would
expect, this accurate solution does not scale. We devise a method that relies
on POMDPs to find good attacks on individual machines, which are then composed
into an attack on the network as a whole. This decomposition exploits network
structure to the extent possible, making targeted approximations (only) where
needed. Evaluating this method on a suitably adapted industrial test suite, we
demonstrate its effectiveness in both runtime and solution quality.

various fitness functions, such least sum of squares. In (Tomescu et al.

polynomially bounded number of paths in an optimal solution, this problem can
be solved in polynomial time by a reduction to a min-cost flow program. In this

RNA virus genomes. Albeit a crude measure, the distribution of spatial
distances in thermodynamic equilibrium therefore provides useful information on
the overall shape of the molecule can provide insights into the interplay of
its functional domains. Spatial distance can be approximated by the
graph-distance in RNA secondary structure. We show here that the equilibrium
distribution of graph-distances between arbitrary nucleotides can be computed
in polynomial time by means of dynamic programming. A naive implementation
would yield recursions with a very high time complexity of O(n^11). Although we
were able to reduce this to O(n^6) for many practical applications a further
reduction seems difficult. We conclude, therefore, that sampling approaches,

between complimentary bases of an RNA sequence of length n can be computed in
O(n^3) time using Nussinov's dynamic programming algorithm. The Four-Russians
method is a technique that will reduce the running time for certain dynamic
programming algorithms by a multiplicative factor after a preprocessing step
where solutions to all smaller subproblems of a fixed size are exhaustively
enumerated and solved. Frid and Gusfield designed an O(\frac{n^3}{\log n})
algorithm for RNA folding using the Four-Russians technique. In their algorithm
the preprocessing is interleaved with the algorithm computation. (Algo. Mol.
Biol., 2010).
  We simplify the algorithm and the analysis by doing the preprocessing once
prior to the algorithm computation. We call this the two-vector method. We also
show variants where instead of exhaustive preprocessing, we only solve the
subproblems encountered in the main algorithm once and memoize the results. We
give a simple proof of correctness and explore the practical advantages over
the earlier method. The Nussinov algorithm admits an O(n^2) time parallel
algorithm. We show a parallel algorithm using the two-vector idea that improves
the time bound to O(\frac{n^2}{log n}).
  We discuss the organization of the data structures to exploit coalesced
memory access for fast running times. The ideas to organize the data structures
also help in improving the running time of the serial algorithms. For sequences
of length up to 6000 bases the parallel algorithm takes only about 2.5 seconds
and the two-vector serial method takes about 57 seconds on a desktop and 15
seconds on a server. Among the serial algorithms, the two-vector and memoized
versions are faster than the Frid-Gusfield algorithm by a factor of 3, and are

for wireless relay networks, and physical layer security is an attractive
alternative solution to address this issue. In this paper, we consider a
cooperative network, consisting of one source node, one destination node, one
eavesdropper node, and a number of relay nodes. Specifically, the source may
select several relays to help forward the signal to the corresponding
destination to achieve the best security performance. However, the relays may
have the incentive not to report their true private channel information in
order to get more chances to be selected and gain more payoff from the source.
We propose a Vickey-Clark-Grove (VCG) based mechanism and an
Arrow-d'Aspremont-Gerard-Varet (AGV) based mechanism into the investigated
relay network to solve this cheating problem. In these two different
mechanisms, we design different ""transfer payment"" functions to the payoff of
each selected relay and prove that each relay gets its maximum (expected)
payoff when it truthfully reveals its private channel information to the
source. And then, an optimal secrecy rate of the network can be achieved. After
discussing and comparing the VCG and AGV mechanisms, we prove that the AGV
mechanism can achieve all of the basic qualifications (incentive compatibility,
individual rationality and budget balance) for our system. Moreover, we discuss
the optimal quantity of relays that the source node should select. Simulation
results verify efficiency and fairness of the VCG and AGV mechanisms, and
consolidate these conclusions.

  Algorithms in Bioinformatics (WABI2013)",,,,"cs.DS cs.CE q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Robinson-Foulds (RF) metric is arguably the most widely used measure of
phylogenetic tree similarity, despite its well-known shortcomings: For example,
moving a single taxon in a tree can result in a tree that has maximum distance
to the original one; but the two trees are identical if we remove the single
taxon. To this end, we propose a natural extension of the RF metric that does
not simply count identical clades but instead, also takes similar clades into
consideration. In contrast to previous approaches, our model requires the
matching between clades to respect the structure of the two trees, a property
that the classical RF metric exhibits, too. We show that computing this
generalized RF metric is, unfortunately, NP-hard. We then present a simple
Integer Linear Program for its computation, and evaluate it by an
all-against-all comparison of 100 trees from a benchmark data set. We find that
matchings that respect the tree structure differ significantly from those that
do not, underlining the importance of this natural condition.

  Algorithms in Bioinformatics (WABI2013)",,,,"q-bio.QM cs.CE cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The phylogenetic Mean Pairwise Distance (MPD) is one of the most popular
measures for computing the phylogenetic distance between a given group of
species. More specifically, for a phylogenetic tree T and for a set of species
R represented by a subset of the leaf nodes of T, the MPD of R is equal to the
average cost of all possible simple paths in T that connect pairs of nodes in
R.
  Among other phylogenetic measures, the MPD is used as a tool for deciding if
the species of a given group R are closely related. To do this, it is important
to compute not only the value of the MPD for this group but also the
expectation, the variance, and the skewness of this metric. Although efficient
algorithms have been developed for computing the expectation and the variance
the MPD, there has been no approach so far for computing the skewness of this
measure.
  In the present work we describe how to compute the skewness of the MPD on a
tree T optimally, in Theta(n) time; here n is the size of the tree T. So far
this is the first result that leads to an exact, let alone efficient,
computation of the skewness for any popular phylogenetic distance measure.
Moreover, we show how we can compute in Theta(n) time several interesting
quantities in T that can be possibly used as building blocks for computing
efficiently the skewness of other phylogenetic measures.

problem in phylogenetics. We consider two versions of this question: agreement
and compatibility. In the first, the supertree is required to reflect precisely
the relationships among the species exhibited by the input trees. In the
second, the supertree can be more refined than the input trees.
  Tree compatibility can be characterized in terms of the existence of a
specific kind of triangulation in a structure known as the display graph.
Alternatively, it can be characterized as a chordal graph sandwich problem in a
structure known as the edge label intersection graph. Here, we show that the
latter characterization yields a natural characterization of compatibility in
terms of minimal cuts in the display graph, which is closely related to
compatibility of splits. We then derive a characterization for agreement.

e.g. the interactions between different species, genes, and biogeographical
properties. Hence, it is interesting to study the combined evolutionary history
of multiple species, their genes, and the environment they live in. A common
approach to address this research problem is to describe each individual
evolution as a phylogenetic tree and construct a tree reconciliation which is
parsimonious with respect to a given event model. Unfortunately, most of the
previous approaches are designed only either for host-parasite systems, for
gene tree/species tree reconciliation, or biogeography. Hence, a method is
desirable, which addresses the general problem of mapping phylogenetic trees
and covering all varieties of coevolving systems, including e.g., predator-prey
and symbiotic relationships. To overcome this gap, we introduce a generalized
cophylogenetic event model considering the combinatorial complete set of local
coevolutionary events. We give a dynamic programming based heuristic for
solving the maximum parsimony reconciliation problem in time O(n^2), for two

study the genome median problem under the algebraic model, whose complexity is
currently open, proposing a more general form of the problem, the matrix median

is a 4/3-approximation of the median. Our results allow us to compute up to
three additional matrix median candidates, all of them with approximation
ratios at least as good as the best corner, when the input matrices come from

summarization. We formulate this problem as finding a few image exemplars to
represent the image set semantically and visually, and solve it in a hybrid way
by exploiting both visual and textual information associated with images. We
propose a novel approach, called homogeneous and heterogeneous message
propagation ($\text{H}^\text{2}\text{MP}$). Similar to the affinity propagation
(AP) approach, $\text{H}^\text{2}\text{MP}$ reduce the conventional
\emph{vector} message propagation to \emph{scalar} message propagation to make
the algorithm more efficient. Beyond AP that can only handle homogeneous data,
$\text{H}^\text{2}\text{MP}$ generalizes it to exploit extra heterogeneous
relations and the generalization is non-trivial as the reduction to scalar
messages from vector messages is more challenging. The main advantages of our
approach lie in 1) that $\text{H}^\text{2}\text{MP}$ exploits visual similarity
and in addition the useful information from the associated tags, including the
associations relation between images and tags and the relations within tags,
and 2) that the summary is both visually and semantically satisfactory. In
addition, our approach can also present a textual summary to a tagged image
collection, which can be used to automatically generate a textual description.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the

carrier transport in semiconductors. This semiclassical approach bridges the
gap between the drift-diffusion and ballistic (""thermionic"") models of carrier
transport, whose validity is limited to the range of very small and very large
values, respectively, of the carrier mean free path. The physical concept
underlying the thermoballistic approach, while incorporating basic features of
the drift-diffusion and ballistic descriptions, constitutes a novel, unifying
scheme. It is based on the introduction of ""ballistic configurations"" defined
by a random partitioning of the length of a semiconducting sample into
ballistic transport intervals, which are linked by points of local
thermodynamic equilibrium at which carriers are emitted or absorbed. By
averaging the carrier currents in the ballistic intervals over all ballistic
configurations, a position-dependent thermoballistic current is derived for
arbitrary magnitude of the carrier mean free path. This current is the key
element of the thermoballistic concept and forms the point of departure of the
calculation of various transport quantities. The present article starts out
with an account of the standard drift-diffusion and ballistic transport models,
and of a prototype model which paves the way for the fully developed form of
that concept. In the main body of the article, a coherent exposition of the
thermoballistic approach is given within a general formulation that takes into
account arbitrarily shaped, spin-split potential energy profiles and spin
relaxation during the carrier motion across ballistic intervals. The
calculational procedures devised for implementing the thermoballistic concept

shock wave. The characteristic wavelength of the thermal instability ranges
from 10^-5 pc to 0.1 pc in the CNM, and from 10^-7 pc to 0.1 pc in the
molecular clouds. This coincides with the size of observed tiny scale
structures in the CNM and molecular clouds, indicating that the thermal
instability in the shocked gas could be a formation mechanism of these tiny
structures in the interstellar medium. We have also calculated the e-folding
number of the thermal instability to estimate the amplification of the density
fluctuation in the shocked gas. Density perturbations in the CNM grow by a
factor of exp(5)~150, whereas the perturbations in the molecular clouds grow
only by a factor of a few behind a high Mach number shock. The amplification
factor is larger at lower densities and higher velocities. Formation of very

correlation for dwarf stars is also valid for giant stars. For this reason,
having precise metallicities is very important. Different methods can provide
different results that lead to discrepancies in the analysis of planet hosts.
To study the impact of different analyses on the metallicity scale for evolved
stars, we compare different iron line lists to use in the atmospheric parameter
derivation of evolved stars. Therefore, we use a sample of 71 evolved stars
with planets. With these new homogeneous parameters, we revisit the metallicity
- giant planet connection for evolved stars. A spectroscopic analysis based on
Kurucz models in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) was performed through
the MOOG code to derive the atmospheric parameters. Two different iron line
list sets were used, one built for cool FGK stars in general, and the other for
giant FGK stars. Masses were calculated through isochrone fitting, using the
Padova models. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests (K-S tests) were then performed on the
metallicity distributions of various different samples of evolved stars and red
giants. All parameters compare well using a line list set, designed
specifically for cool and solar-like stars to provide more accurate
temperatures. All parameters derived with this line list set are preferred and
are thus adopted for future analysis. We find that evolved planet hosts are
more metal-poor than dwarf stars with giant planets. However, a bias in giant
stellar samples that are searched for planets is present. Because of a colour
cut-off, metal-rich low-gravity stars are left out of the samples, making it
hard to compare dwarf stars with giant stars. Furthermore, no metallicity
enhancement is found for red giants with planets ($\log g < 3.0$\,dex) with
respect to red giants without planets.

cm-2 s-1 and metal abundance between 0.1 and 2 times of solar abundance, and
taking into account the gravitational potential and non-equipartition between
ions, electrons and ionization degree. We assume the cylinder and dipole as
geometry of the PSAC. The PSAC becomes higher against the white dwarf (WD)
radius for lower specific accretion rate and more massive WD, and may be
comparable to the WD radius. The consideration of the dipolar geometry
significantly reduces the density and temperature over the whole PSAC comparing
with the cylindrical case when the specific accretion rate is lower than a
threshold which the PSAC height reachs 0.2 RWD with and is decreased by the
more massive white dwarf. We calculate the spectra of the cylindrical and
dipolar PSACs with the wide range of the specific accretion rate. Although the
spectra soften as the specific accretion rate decreases for the both
geometrical assumptions under the specific accretion rate threshold, the
softening is more speedy for the dipolar PSAC. The fact means that the both
geometrical assumptions lead the different WD masses for each other when their
spectra are applied to the IPs hosting the low accretion or a massive WD.
Although the ionization non-equilibrium are also involved for the spectral
calculation, the effects are trivial because the radiation from ionization
non-equilibrium plasma is a few percent of the whole at most.

response of the strain to polarization fluctuations, and the results depend on

electrostrictive interaction, which is long-range in the 90 degree wall case.
For finite $v_s$, acoustic phonons damp the wall excitations, producing a

the first telescope of its kind that is routinely operated from remote, without
the need for a data-taking crew on site. In addition, many standard tasks of
operation are executed automatically without the need for manual interaction.
Based on the experience gained so far, some alterations to improve the safety
of the system are under development to allow robotic operation in the future.

  The two planets proposed to orbit QS Virginis would move on mutually crossing
orbits - a situation that is almost invariably unstable on very short

of the orbital evolution of the two proposed planets, revealing that they are
dynamically unstable on timescales of less than one thousand years across the
entire range of orbital elements that provide a plausible fit to the

conclude that the proposed planets around the cataclysmic variable QS Virginis

Such a resonant effect enables excitation of optical vortices by vortex-free
inputs and allows the output topological charge of the beam to be controlled.
The presence of nonlinearity results in a strong asymmetrization of the
resonant curves and a shift of the resonant frequencies. Resonant vortex
dynamic generation, including revivals, is shown to be possible not only in
waveguides mediated by total internal reflection but also in Bragg-guiding

nature. Following an approach initiated by Dommersnes and Fournier in the
vanishing tension case [Eur. Phys. J. B 12, 9 (1999)], and also using a
pseudo-analytical micellization theory, we derive the statistical mechanics of
asymmetric inclusion assemblies when they are also subject to an additional
short-range, attractive interaction. Our main conclusion is that generically,
when the membrane is under tension, these inclusions live in small clusters at
equilibrium, leading to local membrane invaginations. We also propose a novel
curvature-induced demixing mechanism: when inclusions imposing local curvatures
of opposite sign coexist, they tend to demix in distinct clusters under
realistic conditions. This work has potential implications in the context of
the thermodynamics of proteins embedded in biological lipid bilayers.

of genomic rearrangements typically coupled with changes in the gene copy
number profiles of numerous cells. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is
a cytogenetic technique which allows counting copy numbers of genes in single
cells. The study of cancer progression using FISH data has received
considerably less attention compared to other types of cancer datasets.
  In this work we focus on inferring likely tumor progression pathways using
publicly available FISH data. We model the evolutionary process as a Markov
chain in the positive integer cone Z_+^g where g is the number of genes
examined with FISH. Compared to existing work which oversimplifies reality by
assuming independence of copy number changes, our model is able to capture
dependencies. We model the probability distribution of a dataset with
hierarchical log-linear models, a popular probabilistic model of count data.
Our choice provides an attractive trade-off between parsimony and good data
fit. We prove a theorem of independent interest which provides necessary and
sufficient conditions for reconstructing oncogenetic trees. Using this theorem
we are able to capitalize on the wealth of inter-tumor phylogenetic methods. We
show how to produce tumor phylogenetic trees which capture the dynamics of
cancer progression. We validate our proposed method on a breast tumor dataset.

Most assembly algorithms utilize assembly graphs like the de Bruijn graph or
the overlap graph constructed from reads. From these graphs, many assembly
algorithms first detect simple local graph structures (motifs), such as tips
and bubbles, mainly to find sequencing errors. These motifs are easy to detect,
but they are sometimes too simple to deal with more complex errors. The
superbubble is an extension of the bubble, which is also important for
analyzing assembly graphs. Though superbubbles are much more complex than
ordinary bubbles, we show that they can be efficiently enumerated. We propose
an average-case linear time algorithm (i.e., O(n+m) for a graph with n vertices
and m edges) for graphs with a reasonable model, though the worst-case time
complexity of our algorithm is quadratic (i.e., O(n(n+m))). Moreover, the
algorithm is practically very fast: Our experiments show that our algorithm
runs in reasonable time with a single CPU core even against a very large graph

correlations have applications in cryptography, communication complexity, and
sit at the very heart of many attempts of understanding quantum theory -- and
its limits -- in terms of classical information. In these contexts, the
question is crucial whether such correlations can be amplified or distilled,
i.e., whether and how weak correlations can be used for generating (a smaller
amount of) stronger. Whereas the question has been studied quite extensively
for bipartite correlations (yielding both pessimistic and optimistic results),
only little is known in the multi-partite case. We introduce a general
framework of reductions between multi-party input-output systems. Within this
formalism, we show that a natural n-party generalization of the well-known
Popescu-Rohrlich box can be distilled, by an adaptive protocol, to the
algebraic maximum.We use this result further to show that a much broader class
of correlations, including all purely threepartite correlations, can be
distilled from arbitrarily weak to almost maximal strength with partial
communication, i.e., using only a subset of the channels required for the
creation of the same correlation from scratch. Alternatively, this means that
arbitrarily weak non-local correlations can have a ""communication value"" in the

remains an unresolvable task in repetitive genomes, since when the length of a
repeat exceeds the read length, it becomes difficult to unambiguously connect
the flanking regions. The emergence of third generation sequencing (Pacific
Biosciences) with long reads enables the opportunity to resolve complicated
repeats that could not be resolved by the short read data. However, these long
reads have high error rate and it is an uphill task to assemble the genome
without using additional high quality short reads. Recently, Koren et al. 2012
proposed an approach to use high quality short reads data to correct these long
reads and, thus, make the assembly from long reads possible. However, due to
the large size of both dataset (short and long reads), error-correction of
these long reads requires excessively high computational resources, even on
small bacterial genomes. In this work, instead of error correction of long
reads, we first assemble the short reads and later map these long reads on the
assembly graph to resolve repeats.
  Contribution: We present a hybrid assembly approach that is both
computationally effective and produces high quality assemblies. Our algorithm
first operates with a simplified version of the assembly graph consisting only
of long contigs and gradually improves the assembly by adding smaller contigs
in each iteration. In contrast to the state-of-the-art long reads error
correction technique, which requires high computational resources and long
running time on a supercomputer even for bacterial genome datasets, our
software can produce comparable assembly using only a standard desktop in a
short running time.

field is circularly polarized, contrary to the leading-order nonlinear QED
effects, the axion-photon interaction induces a chiral-like birefringence and a
dichroism in the vacuum. The latter effect is explained by evoking the
conservation of the total angular momentum along the common propagation
direction of probe and the strong wave, which allows for real axion production
only for probe and strong fields with the same helicity. Moreover, in the case
of ultra-short strong pulses, it is shown that the absorption coefficients of
probe photons depend on the form of the pulse and, in particular, on the
carrier-envelope phase of the strong beam. The present results can be exploited
experimentally to isolate nonlinear vacuum effects stemming from light-axion
interaction, especially at upcoming ultra-strong laser facilities, where
stringent constraints on the axion-photon coupling constant are in principle
provided.

spin particles is of current interest in the field of cold atoms. The Hubbard
model, appropriate to atoms in an optical lattice potential, is considered in
parallel with a gas model. As the strength of an attractive short-range

which the Fermi sea is weakly perturbed, to ""molecule"" behaviour in which the
down spin particle is bound to a single up spin particle. It is shown that this
is a smooth crossover, not a sharp transition as claimed by many authors.

Often, the maximum likelihood alignment (Viterbi alignment) is used as its
estimate. Although having the biggest likelihood, the Viterbi alignment can
behave very untypically by passing states that are at most unexpected. To avoid
such situations, the Viterbi alignment can be modified by forcing it not to
pass these states. In this article, an iterative procedure for improving the
Viterbi alignment is proposed and studied. The iterative approach is compared
with a simple bunch approach where a number of states with low probability are
all replaced at the same time. It can be seen that the iterative way of
adjusting the Viterbi alignment is more efficient and it has several advantages
over the bunch approach. The same iterative algorithm for improving the Viterbi
alignment can be used in the case of peeping, that is when it is possible to
reveal hidden states. In addition, lower bounds for classification

function of the dimensionless ratio $\Theta={1}{2}m\al_R^2/E_F$ where $E_F=0$
when the smaller Fermi surface shrinks to a (Dirac) point. The general trend is
that superconductivity is enhanced as $\Theta$ increases, but in an
intermediate regime $\Theta\sim0.1$, a dome-like behavior appears. At a very
small value of $\Theta$, the angular momentum channel $j_z$ in which
superconductivity occurs is quite high. With increasing $\Theta$, $j_z$
decreases with a step of 2 down to $j_z=6$, after which we find the sequence
$j_z=6, 4, 6, 2$, the last value of which continues to
$\Theta\rightarrow\infty$. In an extended range of $\Theta$, the
superconducting gap predominantly resides on the large Fermi surface, while
Josephson coupling induces a much smaller gap on the small Fermi surface. Below
the superconducting transition temperature, we apply mean field theory to
derive the self-consistent equations and find the condensation energies. The
state with the lowest condensation energy is an unconventional superconducting
state which breaks time reversal symmetry, and in which singlet and triplet
pairings are mixed. In general, these states are topologically nontrivial, and

  Mathematics",,,,"math.FA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The classical theorem of Bishop-Phelps asserts that, for a Banach space X,
the norm-achieving functionals in X* are dense in X*. Bela Bollobas's extension
of the theorem gives a quantitative description of just how dense the
norm-achieving functionals have to be: if (x,f) is in X x X* with ||x||=||f||=1
and |1-f(x)|< h^2/4 then there are (x',f') in X x X* with ||x'||= ||f'||=1,
||x-x'||, ||f-f'||< h and f'(x')=1.
  This means that there are always ""proximinal"" hyperplanes H in X (a nonempty
subset E of a metric space is said to be ""proximinal"" if, for x not in E, the
distance d(x,E) is always achieved - there is always an e in E with
d(x,E)=d(x,e)); for if H= ker f (f in X*) then it is easy to see that H is
proximinal if and only if f is norm-achieving. Indeed the set of proximinal
hyperplanes H is, in the appropriate sense, dense in the set of all closed
hyperplanes H in X.
  Quite a long time ago [Problem 2.1 in his monograph ""The Theory of Best

Mathematics, SIAM, 1974], Ivan Singer asked if this result generalized to
closed subspaces of finite codimension - if every Banach space has a proximinal
subspace of codimension 2, for example. In this paper I show that there is a
Banach space X such that X has no proximinal subspace of finite codimension
n>1. So we have a converse to Bishop-Phelps-Bollobas: a dense set of proximinal
hyperplanes can always be found, but proximinal subspaces of larger, finite
codimension need not be.

size. Such resonators couple primarily to the magnetic field component of the
incident electromagnetic wave, offering properties suitable for magnetic
meta-atoms. Surprisingly, the relative frequencies of the resonant modes follow
the sequence of the odd numbers, despite the nearly identical boundary
conditions for electromagnetic fields at the extremities of the resonator. In
order to explain the observed spectrum of resonant modes, we show that the
current distribution inside the spiral satisfies a particular Carleman type
singular integral equation. By solving this equation, we obtain a set of
resonant frequencies. The analytically calculated resonance frequencies and the
current distributions are in good agreement with experimental data and the
results of numerical simulations. By using low-temperature laser scanning
microscopy of a superconducting spiral resonator, we compare the experimentally
visualized ac current distributions over the spiral with the calculated ones.
Theory and experiment agree well with each other. Our analytical model allows
for calculation of a detailed three-dimensional magnetic field structure of the
resonators.

well-known star-forming region W49N has yielded valuable data that enables us
to probe distributions of magnetic fields in both the maser columns and the
intervening interstellar medium (ISM). The data consisting of detailed high
angular-resolution images (with beam-width ~20 milli-arc-seconds) of several
dozen OH maser sources or ""spots"", at 1612, 1665 and 1667 MHz, reveal
anisotropic scatter broadening, with typical sizes of a few tens of
milli-arc-seconds and axial ratios between 1.5 to 3. Such anisotropies have
been reported earlier by Desai, Gwinn & Diamond (1994) and interpreted as
induced by the local magnetic field parallel to the Galactic plane. However, we
find a) the apparent angular sizes on the average a factor of ~2.5 less than
those reported by Desai et al. (1994), indicating significantly less scattering
than inferred earlier, and b) a significant deviation in the average
orientation of the scatter-broadened images (by ~10 degrees) from that implied
by the magnetic field in the Galactic plane. More intriguingly, for a few
Zeeman pairs in our set, significant differences (up to 6 sigma) are apparent
in the scatter broadened images for the two hands of circular polarization,
even when apparent velocity separation is less than 0.1 km/s. This may possibly
be the first example of a Faraday rotation contribution to the diffractive
effects in the ISM. Using the Zeeman pairs, we also study the distribution of
magnetic field in the W49N complex, finding no significant trend in the spatial
structure function. In this paper, we present the details of our observations
and analysis leading to these findings, discuss implications of our results for
the intervening anisotropic magneto-ionic medium, and suggest the possible

a large heat exchanger be optimized? The scientific potential of IRIDE is far

convergence and asymptotic normality of the importance sampling estimate, and
can be important for the reliability of the method in practice. We derive
conditions for the existence of any required moments of the weights for

sufficient for a wide range of models with latent Gaussian components.
Important examples are time series and panel data models with measurement
densities which belong to the exponential family. We introduce practical and
simple methods for checking and imposing the conditions for the existence of
the desired moments. We develop a two component mixture proposal that allows us
to flexibly adapt a given proposal density into a robust importance density.
These methods are illustrated on a wide range of models including generalized

previously unpublished data taken around the start of activity of the comet in

of activity, and combine this with other data taken throughout the comet's
orbit to make predictions for its likely behaviour during 2014/5 while Rosetta
is operating. A considerable difficulty in observing 67P during the past years
has been its position against crowded fields towards the Galactic centre for
much of the time. The 2007/8 data presented here were particularly difficult,
and the comet will once again be badly placed for Earth-based observations in
2014/5. We make use of the difference image analysis (DIA) technique, which is
commonly used in variable star and exoplanet research, to remove background
sources and extract images of the comet. In addition, we reprocess a large
quantity of archival images of 67P covering its full orbit, to produce a
heliocentric lightcurve. By using consistent reduction, measurement and
calibration techniques we generate a remarkably clean lightcurve, which can be
used to measure a brightness-distance relationship and to predict the future
brightness of the comet. We determine that the comet was active around November
2007, at a pre-perihelion distance from the Sun of 4.3 AU. The comet will reach
this distance, and probably become active again, in March 2014. We find that
the dust brightness can be well described by Af\rho \propto r^-3.2
pre-perihelion and r^-3.4 post-perihelion, and that the comet has a higher
dust-to-gas ratio than average. A model fit to the photometric data suggests
that only a small fraction (1.4%) of the surface is active.

  Dirty Data","IJCAI",,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.CY cs.SI physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An important part of cooking with computers is using statistical methods to
create new, flavorful ingredient combinations. The flavor pairing hypothesis
states that culinary ingredients with common chemical flavor components combine
well to produce pleasant dishes. It has been recently shown that this design
principle is a basis for modern Western cuisine and is reversed for Asian
cuisine.
  Such data-driven analysis compares the chemistry of ingredients to ingredient
sets found in recipes. However, analytics-based generation of novel flavor
profiles can only be as good as the underlying chemical and recipe data.
Incomplete, inaccurate, and irrelevant data may degrade flavor pairing
inferences. Chemical data on flavor compounds is incomplete due to the nature
of the experiments that must be conducted to obtain it. Recipe data may have
issues due to text parsing errors, imprecision in textual descriptions of
ingredients, and the fact that the same ingredient may be known by different
names in different recipes. Moreover, the process of matching ingredients in
chemical data and recipe data may be fraught with mistakes. Much of the
`dirtiness' of the data cannot be cleansed even with manual curation.
  In this work, we collect a new data set of recipes from Medieval Europe
before the Columbian Exchange and investigate the flavor pairing hypothesis
historically. To investigate the role of data incompleteness and error as part
of this hypothesis testing, we use two separate chemical compound data sets
with different levels of cleanliness. Notably, the different data sets give
conflicting conclusions about the flavor pairing hypothesis in Medieval Europe.
As a contribution towards social science, we obtain inferences about the
evolution of culinary arts when many new ingredients are suddenly made
available.

proposed, which are bouncing, fragmentation, and radial drift problems. To
understand the structure evolution of dust aggregates is a key in the
planetesimal formation. Dust grains become fluffy by coagulation in
protoplanetary disks. However, once they become fluffy, they are not
sufficiently compressed by collisional compression to form compact
planetesimals. Aims: We aim to reveal the pathway of the dust structure
evolution from dust grains to compact planetesimals. Methods: Using the
compressive strength formula, we analytically investigate how fluffy dust
aggregates are compressed by static compression due to ram pressure of the disk
gas and self gravity of the aggregates in protoplanetary disks. Results: We
reveal the pathway of the porosity evolution from dust grains via fluffy
aggregates to form planetesimals, circumventing the barriers in planetesimal
formation. The aggregates are compressed by the disk gas to the density of
10^{-3} g/cm^3 in coagulation, which is more compact than the case with
collisional compression. Then, they are compressed more by self gravity to
10^{-1} g/cm^3 when the radius is 10 km. Although the gas compression
decelerate the growth, they grow enough rapidly to avoid the radial drift
barrier when the orbital radius is < 6 AU in a typical disk. Conclusions: We
propose fluffy dust growth scenario from grains to planetesimals. It enables
the icy planetesimal formation in a wide range beyond the snowline in
protoplanetary disks. This result proposes a concrete initial condition of
planetesimals for the later stages of the planet formation.

scale of curvature of momentum space. As other recent studies we assume that
the metric of momentum space determines the condition of on-shellness while the
momentum-space affine connection governs the form of the law of composition of
momenta. We show that the possible choices of laws of composition of momenta
are more numerous than the possible choices of affine connection on a momentum
space. This motivates us to propose a new prescription for associating an
affine connection to momentum composition, which we compare to the one most
used in the recent literature. We find that the two prescriptions lead to the
same picture of the so-called $\kappa$-momentum space, with de Sitter metric
and $\kappa$-Poincar\'e connection. We also examine in greater detail than ever
before the DSR-relativistic properties of $\kappa$-momentum space, particularly
in relation to its noncommutative law of composition of momenta. We then show
that in the case of ""proper de Sitter momentum space"", with the de Sitter
metric and its Levi-Civita connection, the two prescriptions are inequivalent.
Our novel prescription leads to a picture of proper de Sitter momentum space
which is DSR-relativistic and is characterized by a commutative law of
composition of momenta, a possibility for which no explicit
curved-momentum-space picture had been previously found. We argue that our
construction provides a natural test case for the study of momentum spaces with
commutative, and yet deformed, laws of composition of momenta. Moreover, it can
serve as laboratory for the exploration of the properties of DSR-relativistic
theories which are not connected to group-manifold momentum spaces and Hopf
algebras.

mixed state of a qubit is \emph{preparation contextual}. Interestingly, this
new idea of preparation contextuality has been used to demonstrate nonlocality
of some $\psi$-epistemic models without any use of Bell's inequality. In
particular, nonlocality of a non maximally $\psi$-epistemic model has been
demonstrated from preparation contextuality of a maximally mixed qubit and
Schr\""{o}dinger's steerability of the maximally entangled state of two qubits
[Phys. Rev. Lett {\bf 110}, 120401 (2013)]. In this paper, we, show that any

bipartite pure entangled state, with Schmidt rank two, follows from preparation
contextuality and steerability provided we impose certain condition on the
epistemicity of the underlying ontological model. More interestingly, if the
pure entangled state is of Schmidt rank greater than two, its nonlocality
follows without any further condition on the epistemicity. Thus our result
establishes a stronger connection between nonlocality and preparation
contextuality by revealing nonlocality of any bipartite pure entangled states

nonthermal (synchrotron) - far-infrared correlations in M31 and M33. The
thermal (TH) and nonthermal (NTH) emission components of the radio continuum
emission at 1.4 GHz and one higher frequency are compared with dust emission
from M31 and M33 using Spitzer data. In both galaxies the TH emission is
linearly correlated with the emission from warm dust (24 \mu m, 70 \mu m), but
the power laws of the NTH-FIR correlations have exponents b < 1 that increase
with increasing frequency. Furthermore, the values of b for M33 are
significantly smaller (b ~ 0.4) than those for M31 (b ~ 0.6). We interpret the
differences in b as differences in the diffusion length of the CRE. We estimate
the diffusion length in two ways: (1) by smoothing the NTH emission at the
higher frequency until the correlation with NTH emission at 1.4 GHz has b = 1,
and (2) by smoothing the TH emission until the correlation with the NTH
emission at the same frequency has b = 1, assuming that the TH emission
represents the source distribution of the CRE. Our smoothing experiments show
that M31 only has a thin NTH disk with a scale height of h = 0.3-0.4 kpc at 1.4
GHz, whereas M33 has a similar thin disk as well as a thick disk with scale
height h_thick ~ 2 kpc. In the thin disks, the (deprojected) diffusion length
at 1.4 GHz is ~ 1.5 kpc, yielding a diffusion coefficient of ~ 2 10^28 cm^2/s.
The structure, strength and regularity of the magnetic field in a galaxy as
well as the existence of a thick disk determine the diffusion of the CRE, and
hence, the power-law exponent of the NTH-FIR correlations.

using $l_1/l_2$-regularized Lasso. We characterize sufficient and necessary
conditions on sample complexity \emph{as a sharp threshold} to guarantee
successful recovery of the support union. Namely, if the sample size is above
the threshold, then $l_1/l_2$-regularized Lasso correctly recovers the support
union; and if the sample size is below the threshold, $l_1/l_2$-regularized
Lasso fails to recover the support union. In particular, the threshold
precisely captures the impact of the sparsity of regression vectors and the
statistical properties of the design matrices on sample complexity. Therefore,
the threshold function also captures the advantages of joint support union
recovery using multi-task Lasso over individual support recovery using
single-task Lasso.

Yukawa unification, as predicted by minimal SO(10) GUTs. Many patterns of
gaugino masses leading to enhanced Higgs to diphoton rate and the Yukawa
unification are identified. Some of these patterns can be accommodated in a
well-motivated scenarios such as mirage mediation or SUSY breaking F-terms
being a non-singlet of SO(10). Phenomenological implications of a scenario with
non-universal gaugino masses generated by a mixture of the singlet F-term and

involved populations related to Niger-Congo-speaking African populations, and
the other introduced ancestry most closely related to west Eurasian (European

the process of spiralling-in to its current short-period orbit. A large
fraction of CE phases which end with ejection of the envelope are thought to be
initiated by low-mass red giants, giants with inert, degenerate helium cores.
We discuss the possible end-of-CE structures of such stars and their subsequent
evolution to investigate for which structures planetary nebulae are formed. We
assume that a planetary nebula forms if the remnant reaches an effective
temperature greater than 30 kK within 10^4 yr of ejecting its envelope. We
assume that the composition profile is unchanged during the CE phase so that
possible remnant structures are parametrized by the end-of-CE core mass,
envelope mass and entropy profile. We find that planetary nebulae are expected
in post-CE systems with core masses greater than about 0.3 solar masses if
remnants end the CE phase in thermal equilibrium. We show that whether the
remnant undergoes a pre-white dwarf plateau phase depends on the prescribed
end-of-CE envelope mass. Thus, observing a young post-CE system would constrain
the end-of CE envelope mass and post-CE evolution.

interesting to distinguish from weakly interacting massive particles. Sikivie
has suggested that axions could behave differently during non-linear galaxy
evolution, if they form a Bose-Einstein condensate, and argues that
``gravitational thermalisation'' drives them to a Bose-Einstein condensate
during the radiation dominated era. Using classical equations of motion during
linear structure formation, we explore whether the gravitational interactions
of axions can generate entropy. At linear order in Newton's constant, we
interpret that the principle activities of gravity are to expand the Universe
and grow density fluctuations. To quantify the rate of entropy creation we use
the anisotropic stress to estimate a short dissipation scale for axions, which
does not confirm previous estimates of their gravitational thermalisation rate.

non-deterministic actions and unforeseen changes, robots need to adapt sensing,
processing and interaction with humans to the tasks at hand. While robots
typically cannot process all sensor inputs or operate without substantial
domain knowledge, it is a challenge to provide accurate domain knowledge and
humans may not have the time and expertise to provide elaborate and accurate
feedback. The architecture described in this paper combines declarative
programming and probabilistic reasoning to address these challenges, enabling
robots to: (a) represent and reason with incomplete domain knowledge, resolving
ambiguities and revising existing knowledge using sensor inputs and minimal
human feedback; and (b) probabilistically model the uncertainty in sensor input
processing and navigation. Specifically, Answer Set Programming (ASP), a
declarative programming paradigm, is combined with hierarchical partially
observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), using domain knowledge to revise
probabilistic beliefs, and using positive and negative observations for early
termination of tasks that can no longer be pursued. All algorithms are
evaluated in simulation and on mobile robots locating target objects in indoor
domains.

line, enumerated by the positive integers $n=1,2,\dotsc$, whose ordinates can

on $n$. Under weak assumptions, we show that the number of such zeros already
saturates the counting formula for the numbers of zeros on the entire critical

Riemann hypothesis. We perform numerical analyses of the exact equation, and
its asymptotic limit of large ordinate. The starting point is an explicit
analytical formula for an approximate solution to the exact equation in terms
of the Lambert $W$ function. In this way, we neither have to use Gram points or
deal with violations of Gram's law. Our numerical approach thus constitutes a
novel method to compute the zeros. Employing these numerical solutions, we
verify that solutions of the asymptotic version are accurate enough to confirm
Montgomery's and Odlyzko's pair correlation conjectures and also to reconstruct
the prime number counting function.

material beyond the shock, producing noticeable effects in intensity line
ratios such as [O III]/Halpha. To investigate the occurrence of shocks in

of PNe available in the HST archive to build their [O III]/Halpha ratio maps
and to search for regions where this ratio is enhanced. Regions with enhanced
[O III]/Halpha emission ratio can be ascribed to two different types of
morphological structures: bow-shock structures produced by fast collimated
outflows and thin skins enveloping expanding nebular shells. Both collimated
outflows and expanding shells are therefore confirmed to generate shocks in
PNe. We also find regions with depressed values of the [O III]/Halpha ratio
which are found mostly around density bounded PNe, where the local contribution
of [N II] emission into the F656N Halpha filter cannot be neglected.

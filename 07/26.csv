performance from the broadest aggregation levels such as countries, down to
institutes and research teams. When applied to still more specialized
publication sets at the level of individual scientists, also a more accurate
delimitation is required of the reference domain that provides the expectations
to which a performance is compared. This necessity for sharper accuracy
challenges standard methodology based on predefined subject categories. This
paper proposes a way to define a reference domain that is more strongly
delimited than in standard methodology, by building it up out of cells of the
partition created by the pre-defined subject categories and their
intersections. This partition approach can be applied to different existing
field normalization variants. The resulting reference domain lies between those
generated by standard field normalization and journal normalization. Examples
based on fictive and real publication records illustrate how the potential
impact on results can exceed or be smaller than the effect of other currently
debated normalization variants, depending on the case studied. The proposed
Partition-based Field Normalization is expected to offer advantages in
particular at the level of individual scientists and other very specific
publication records, such as publication output from interdisciplinary
research.

mean-motion resonances where the orbit of the planet would be stable. We
calculated TTVs for different values of the mass and orbital elements of the
transiting and perturbing bodies as well as the mass of central star, and
identified orbital configurations of these objects (ranges of their orbital
elements and masses) for which the resulted TTVs would be within the range of

of our study indicate that in general, the amplitudes of the TTVs fall within

regions with an optical depth of more than one order of magnitude higher. We
associate this correlation with an evolution of the dust emissivity related to
the fraction of molecular gas along the line of sight. This translates into
beta_mm ~ 1.54 for a medium that is mostly atomic and beta_mm ~ 1.66 when the
medium is dominated by molecular gas. We find that both the Two-Level System

results improve our understanding of the physics of interstellar dust and lead

to model these halo intensities and constrain the value of the phase function
asymmetry factor $g$ of the scattering grains in the FUV and NUV. However due
to the uncertainty in the dust geometry they could not constrain the albedo. In
this work we have tried to constrain the optical constants and dust geometry by
modeling the UV halo of Spica. Since the halo emission is not symmetric, we
have modeled the Northern and Southern parts of the halo separately. To the
North of Spica, the best-fit albedo is 0.26$\pm$0.1 and $g$ is 0.58$\pm$0.11 in
the FUV at the 90% confidence level. The corresponding limits on the distance
and optical depth ($\tau$) of the dust sheet is 3.65$\pm$1.05 pc and
0.047$\pm$0.006 respectively. However, owing to a complicated dust distribution
to the South of Spica, we were unable to uniquely constrain the dust parameters
in that region. Nevertheless, by assuming the optical constants of the Northern
region and assuming a denser medium, we were able to constrain the distance of

oscillating vortex segments trapped between nanoscale pinning centers, taking
into account all bending modes and the nonlocal line tension of the vortex

reconstructing the spatial distribution of vortex dissipation sources from the

types of severe challenges: First, the number of degrees of freedom is large;
and second, the dynamics is characterized by widely disparate time scales. As a
result, reactive flow solvers with detailed chemistry often become intractable
even for large clusters of CPUs, especially when dealing with direct numerical
simulation (DNS) of turbulent combustion problems. This has motivated the
development of several techniques for reducing the complexity of such kinetics
models, where eventually only a few variables are considered in the development
of the simplified model. Unfortunately, no generally applicable a priori recipe
for selecting suitable parameterizations of the reduced model is available, and
the choice of slow variables often relies upon intuition and experience. We
present an automated approach to this task, consisting of three main steps.
First, the low dimensional manifold of slow motions is (approximately) sampled
by brief simulations of the detailed model, starting from a rich enough
ensemble of admissible initial conditions. Second, a global parameterization of
the manifold is obtained through the Diffusion Map (DMAP) approach, which has
recently emerged as a powerful tool in data analysis/machine learning. Finally,
a simplified model is constructed and solved on the fly in terms of the above
reduced (slow) variables. Clearly, closing this latter model requires
nontrivial interpolation calculations, enabling restriction (mapping from the
full ambient space to the reduced one) and lifting (mapping from the reduced
space to the ambient one). This is a key step in our approach, and a variety of
interpolation schemes are reported and compared. The scope of the proposed
procedure is presented and discussed by means of an illustrative combustion
example.

mostly of neutral hydrogen gas. Ly-alpha photons produced by early stars
resonantly scatter off hydrogen atoms, causing energy exchange between the
radiation field and the gas. This interaction results in moderate heating of
the gas due to the recoil of the atoms upon scattering, which is of great
interest for future studies of the pre-reionization IGM in the HI 21 cm line.
We investigate the effect of this Ly-alpha heating in the IGM with linear
density, temperature, and velocity perturbations. Perturbations smaller than
the diffusion length of photons could be damped due to heat conduction by
Ly-alpha photons. The scale at which damping occurs and the strength of this
effect depend on various properties of the gas, the flux of Ly-alpha photons
and the way in which photon frequencies are redistributed upon scattering. To
find the relevant length scale and the extent to which Ly-alpha heating affects
perturbations, we calculate the gas heating rates by numerically solving
linearized Boltzmann equations in which scattering is treated by the
Fokker-Planck approximation. We find that (1) perturbations add a small
correction to the gas heating rate, and (2) the damping of temperature
perturbations occurs at scales with comoving wavenumber k>10^4 Mpc^{-1}, which
are much smaller than the Jeans scale and thus unlikely to substantially affect
the observed 21 cm signal.

$|b|=20^{\circ}-50^{\circ}$, the \textit{Fermi bubbles} energy spectrum can be
reproduced by gamma-ray photons generated by inverse Compton scattering
processes, assuming the existence of a population of high-energy electrons. At
low latitude, $|b|=10^{\circ}-20^{\circ}$, the presence of a bump at
$E_{\gamma}\sim 1-4$ GeV, reveals the existence of an extra component
compatible with Dark Matter annihilation. Our best-fit candidate corresponds to
annihilation into $b\bar{b}$ with mass $M_{\rm DM}= 61.8^{+6.9}_{-4.9}$ GeV and
cross section $<\sigma v> = 3.30^{+0.69}_{-0.49}\times 10^{-26}$

bubbles}, we derive new conservative but stringent upper limits on the Dark
Matter annihilation cross section.

derive effective equations of lower dimensionality for BECs in $(m,n_{r})$

$n_{r}$ concentric zero-density rings at every $z$ plane) which provides us
with a good approximate solution of the original 3D problem. Since the

a couple of parameters, the functional form of the equations obtained is
universal. The model proposed finds its principal application in the study of
the existence and classification of 3D gap solitons supported by 1D optical

  16-19 June 2013 Prague Czech Republic (2013)",,,,"cs.CE cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A prototype tool to assist architects during the early design stage of floor
plans has been developed, consisting of an Evolutionary Program for the Space
Allocation Problem (EPSAP), which generates sets of floor plan alternatives
according to the architect's preferences; and a Floor Plan Performance
Optimization Program (FPOP), which optimizes the selected solutions according
to thermal performance criteria. The design variables subject to optimization
are window position and size, overhangs, fins, wall positioning, and building
orientation. A procedure using a transformation operator with gradient descent,
such as behavior, coupled with a dynamic simulation engine was developed for
the thermal evaluation and optimization process. However, the need to evaluate
all possible alternatives regarding designing variables being used during the
optimization process leads to an intensive use of thermal simulation, which
dramatically increases the simulation time, rendering it unpractical. An
alternative approach is a smart optimization approach, which utilizes an
oriented and adaptive search technique to efficiently find the near optimum
solution. This paper presents the search methodology for the building
orientation of floor plan designs, and the corresponding efficiency and
effectiveness indicators. The calculations are based on 100 floor plan designs
generated by EPSAP. All floor plans have the same design program, location, and
weather data, changing only their geometry. Dynamic simulation of buildings was
effectively used together with the optimization procedure in this approach to
significantly improve the designs. The use of the orientation variable has been
included in the algorithm.

functional, called Frame energy, is naturally linked to the Willmore energy of
the immersion and on the conformal structure of the abstract underlying
surface. As first result, a Willmore-conjecture type lower bound is established
: namely for every torus immersed in $\R^m$, $m\geq 3$, and any moving frame on
it, the frame energy is at least $2\pi^2$ and equalty holds if and only if
$m\geq 4$, the immersion is the standard Clifford torus (up to rotations and
dilations), and the frame is the flat one. Smootheness of the critical points
of the frame energy is proved after the discovery of hidden conservation laws
and, as application, the minimization of the Frame energy in regular homotopy
classes of immersed tori in $\R^3$ is performed.

globally from observations made locally and regionally. In land change science
(LCS), local field-based observations are costly and time consuming, and
generally obtained by researchers working at disparate local and regional
case-study sites chosen for different reasons. As a result, global synthesis
efforts in LCS tend to be based on non-statistical inferences subject to
geographic biases stemming from data limitations and fragmentation. Thus, a
fundamental challenge is the production of generalized knowledge that links
evidence of the causes and consequences of local land change to global patterns
and vice versa. The GLOBE system was designed to meet this challenge. GLOBE
aims to transform global change science by enabling new scientific workflows
based on statistically robust, globally relevant integration of local and
regional observations using an online social-computational and geovisualization
system. Consistent with the goals of Digital Earth, GLOBE has the capability to
assess the global relevance of local case-study findings within the context of
over 50 global biophysical, land-use, climate, and socio-economic datasets. We
demonstrate the implementation of one such assessment - a representativeness
analysis - with a recently published meta-study of changes in swidden
agriculture in tropical forests. The analysis provides a standardized indicator
to judge the global representativeness of the trends reported in the
meta-study, and a geovisualization is presented that highlights areas for which
sampling efforts can be reduced and those in need of further study. GLOBE will
enable researchers and institutions to rapidly share, compare, and synthesize
local and regional studies within the global context, as well as contributing
to the larger goal of creating a Digital Earth.

number of different dopant related features that fall into two classes, which
we call As1 and As2. When imaged in occupied states the As1 features appear as
anisotropic protrusions superimposed on the silicon surface topography, and
have maximum intensities lying along particular crystallographic orientations.
In empty-state images the features all exhibit long-range circular protrusions.
The images are consistent with buried dopants that are in the electrically
neutral (D0) charge state when imaged in filled states, but become positively
charged (D+) through electrostatic ionisation when imaged under empty state
conditions, similar to previous observations of acceptors in GaAs. Density
functional theory (DFT) calculations predict that As dopants in the third layer
of the sample induce two states lying just below the conduction band edge,
which hybridize with the surface structure creating features with the surface
symmetry consistent with our STM images. The As2 features have the surprising
characteristic of appearing as a protrusion in filled state images and an
isotropic depression in empty state images, suggesting they are negatively
charged at all biases. We discuss the possible origins of this feature.

a purely algebraic structure on a space. The equivalence between the homotopy

is ""correct"" or not; and (2) an ""equivalence"" theory (set of formulae), which
represents the users opinion about which pairs of behaviors are equivalent with

Alternatively, the user can specify a type theory and a simple relational
grammar, and our method can generate the vocabulary and equivalence theories.
Our method automatically generates behaviors using a satisfiability modulo
theory solver. Since writing a specification consists of formalizing ideas that
are initially informal, there must, by definition, be at least one ""initial""
step where an informal notion is formalized by the user in an ad hoc manner.
This step is the provision of the equivalence theory and vocabulary; we call it
the primitive formalization step. We contend that it is considerably easier to
write an equivalence theory and vocabulary than to write a full-blown formal
specification from scratch, and we provide experimental evidence for this

International Conference on Concurrency Theory.
  The EXPRESS workshops aim at bringing together researchers interested in the
expressiveness of various formal systems and semantic notions, particularly in
the field of concurrency. Their focus has traditionally been on the comparison
between programming concepts (such as concurrent, functional, imperative, logic
and object-oriented programming) and between mathematical models of computation
(such as process algebras, Petri nets, event structures, modal logics, and
rewrite systems) on the basis of their relative expressive power. The EXPRESS
workshop series has run successfully since 1994 and over the years this focus
has become broadly construed.
  The SOS workshops aim at being a forum for researchers, students and
practitioners interested in new developments, and directions for future
investigation, in the field of structural operational semantics. One of the
specific goals of the SOS workshop series is to establish synergies between the
concurrency and programming language communities working on the theory and
practice of SOS. Reports on applications of SOS to other fields are also most
welcome, including: modelling and analysis of biological systems, security of
computer systems programming, modelling and analysis of embedded systems,
specification of middle-ware and coordination languages, programming language
semantics and implementation, static analysis software and hardware

  Analysis of CO emission in G305 reveals 156 molecular clumps with the
following physical characteristics. The 5.5 and 8.8GHz radio continuum emission
reveals an extended low surface brightness ionised environment within which we
identify 15 large-scale features with a further eight smaller sources projected
within these features. By comparing to mid infrared emission and archival data,
we identify nine HII regions, seven compact HII regions, one UC HII region,
four extended regions. The total integrated flux of the radio continuum
emission at 5.5 GHz is ~180 Jy corresponding to a Lyman continuum output of
2.4x10^50 photons s^-1. We compare the ionised and molecular environment with
optically identified high-mass stars and ongoing star formation, identified
from the literature. Analysis of this dataset reveals a star formation rate of
0.008--0.016 and efficiency of 7--12%, allows us to probe the star formation
history of the region and discuss the impact of high-mass stars on the
evolution of G305.

absorption lines in BL-Lacs make the estimation of their redshifts very
difficult. Modeling the drop in gamma-ray spectra it was possible to have an
estimation of redshift for PKS 0447-439 of z approx 0.2, which is compatible
with the value z=0.205 reported by the identification of Ca II absorption lines
in optical spectra. By the identification of a weak line of Mg II using spectra
with average signal-to-noise S/N approx 80, it has been recently reported a
lower limit for the redshift of this blazar of z<=1.246. Triggered by this
controversy, we have proposed new optical observations with the Gemini South

(approx 200-500). In this work we present a new optical spectrum of PKS
0447-439, and report on the analysis and results of such observations. Even
with this significantly high quality signal we were not able to identify any
spectral features to allow an estimation of the redshift. In agreement with
other recent studies, we identify the Mg II line reported previously as
originated in the Earth's atmosphere, and conclude the lower limit of the
redshift is incorrect. More interestingly, we could not identify the Ca II
absorption lines used to report a redshift of 0.205.

simulation of collapsing unmagnetized molecular cloud cores. We investigate the
formation and evolution of the circumstellar disk and the clumps formed by disk
fragmentation. Our simulation shows that disk fragmentation occurs in the early
phase of circumstellar disk evolution and many clumps form. The clump can be
represented by a polytrope sphere of index $n \sim 3$ and $n \gtrsim 4$ at
central temperature $T_c \lesssim100$ K and $T_c \gtrsim 100$ K, respectively.
We demonstrate, numerically and theoretically, that the maximum mass of the
clump, beyond which it inevitably collapses, is $\sim 0.03 M_{\odot}$. The
entropy of the clump increases during its evolution, implying that evolution is
chiefly determined by mass accretion from the disk rather than by radiative
cooling. Although most of the clumps rapidly migrate inward and finally fall
onto the protostar, a few clumps remain in the disk. The central density and
temperature of the surviving clump rapidly increase and the clump undergoes a
second collapse within 1000 - 2000 years after its formation. In our
simulation, three second cores of masses $0.2\msun$, $0.15\msun$, and
$0.06\msun$ formed. These are protostars or brown dwarfs rather than
protoplanets. For the clumps to survive as planetary-mass objects, the rapid
mass accretion should be prevented by some mechanisms.

a lower radiation efficiency than FSRQs. Being different from BL Lacs, the jet
powers of FSRQs are proportional to their central BH masses. The jet production
and radiation rates of the FSRQs distribute in narrow ranges and are correlated
with each other, whereas no similar feature is found for the BL Lacs. We also
show that the jet power is correlated with the cavity kinetic power, and the
magnetic field energy in the jets may provide the cavity kinetic energy of
FSRQs and the kinetic energy of cold protons in the jets may be crucial for
cavity kinetic energy of BL Lacs. We suggest that the dominating formation
mechanism of FSRQ jets may be the BZ process, but BL Lac jets may be produced
via the BP and/or BZ processes, depending on the structures and accretion rates

lead to photon mass generation, instead the Goldstone boson becomes a massless

when spontaneous symmetry breaking takes place and generalizations to global
vector QED are discussed. In this framework Q-Balls and other non topological

focuses on phenotypic differences due to cellular morphology or specific
genetic mutations, but often ignore the cell's position within the
heterogeneous substructure. Similar disregard for local neighborhood structure
is common in mathematical models.
  Methods: We view the dynamics of disease progression as an evolutionary game
between cellular phenotypes. A typical assumption in this modeling paradigm is
that the probability of a given phenotypic strategy interacting with another
depends exclusively on the abundance of those strategies without regard local
heterogeneities. We address this limitation by using the Ohtsuki-Nowak
transform to introduce spatial structure to the go vs. grow game.
  Results: We show that spatial structure can promote the invasive (go)
strategy. By considering the change in neighbourhood size at a static boundary
-- such as a blood-vessel, organ capsule, or basement membrane -- we show an
edge effect that allows a tumour without invasive phenotypes in the bulk to
have a polyclonal boundary with invasive cells. We present an example of this
promotion of invasive (EMT positive) cells in a metastatic colony of prostate
adenocarcinoma in bone marrow.
  Interpretation: Pathologic analyses that do not distinguish between cells in
the bulk and cells at a static edge of a tumour can underestimate the number of
invasive cells. We expect our approach to extend to other evolutionary game
models where interaction neighborhoods change at fixed system boundaries.

a small number of measurements, has tremendous potential for trajectory
compression. In order to optimize the compression, trajectory compression
algorithms need to adapt compression ratio subject to the compressibility of
the trajectory. Intuitively, the trajectory of an object moving in starlight
road is more compressible compared to the trajectory of a object moving in
winding roads, therefore, higher compression is achievable in the former case
compared to the later. We propose an in-situ compression technique underpinning
the support vector regression theory, which accurately predicts the
compressibility of a trajectory given the mean speed of the object and then
apply compressive sensing to adapt the compression to the compressibility of
the trajectory. The conventional encoding and decoding process of compressive
sensing uses predefined dictionary and measurement (or projection) matrix
pairs. However, the selection of an optimal pair is nontrivial and exhaustive,
and random selection of a pair does not guarantee the best compression
performance. In this paper, we propose a deterministic and data driven
construction for the projection matrix which is obtained by applying singular
value decomposition to a sparsifying dictionary learned from the dataset. We
analyze case studies of pedestrian and animal trajectory datasets including GPS
trajectory data from 127 subjects. The experimental results suggest that the
proposed adaptive compression algorithm, incorporating the deterministic
construction of projection matrix, offers significantly better compression
performance compared to the state-of-the-art alternatives.

an arbitrary time-dependent motion in a density-stratified fluid is
investigated theoretically. The study is carried out under the
Oberbeck-Boussinesq approximation, and in the limit of small Reynolds and small
P\'eclet numbers. The force acting on the particle is obtained by using matched
asymptotic expansions in which the small parameter is given by a/l where a is
the particle radius and l is the stratification length defined by Ardekani &
Stocker (2010), which depends on the Brunt-Vaisala frequency, on the fluid
kinematic viscosity and on the thermal or the concentration diffusivity
(depending on the case considered). The matching procedure used here, which is
based on series expansions of generalized functions, slightly differs from that
generally used in similar problems. In addition to the classical Stokes drag,
it is found the particle experiences a memory force given by two convolution
products, one of which involves, as usual, the particle acceleration and the
other one, the particle velocity. Owing to the stratification, the transient
behaviour of this memory force, in response to an abrupt motion, consists of an
initial fast decrease followed by a damped oscillation with an
angular-frequency corresponding to the Brunt-Vaisala frequency. The
perturbation force eventually tends to a constant which provides us with
correction terms that should be added to the Stokes drag to accurately predict
the settling time of a particle in a diffusive stratified-fluid.

confinement forces in QCD. The confinement is realized most naturally in terms
of the QCD string whose quantization gives rise to the radially excited modes.
We propose an alternative framework for the description of the excited
spectrum. Namely we put forward some effective field models in which the
hadrons acquire masses due to interaction with a scalar field modeling the
non-perturbative gluon vacuum. The effective potential for this field is
periodic with an infinite number of non-equivalent vacua. The radially excited
hadrons emerge as elementary excitations over different vacua. We construct
explicit examples for such effective theories in the meson sector. An
interesting byproduct of the considered models is the existence of a classical
field configuration in each vacuum. Depending on the model, it can represent a
domain wall, Nielsen-Olesen vortex or 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole. In the pure
scalar sector, it is shown that the first quantum correction leads to splitting
of the radially excited modes into two nearly degenerate states. Such a
phenomenon has some phenomenological support. The presented approach may be
also viewed as an alternative framework to the bottom-up AdS/QCD models where
the radial excitations appear on the classical level as well.

set problem consists of constructing a FVS of size less than a certain given
value. This combinatorial optimization problem has many practical applications,
but it is in the nondeterministic polynomial-complete class of worst-case
computational complexity. In this paper we define a spin glass model for the
FVS problem and then study this model on the ensemble of finite-connectivity
random graphs. In our model the global cycle constraints are represented
through the local constraints on all the edges of the graph, and they are then
treated by distributed message-passing procedures such as belief propagation.
Our belief propagation-guided decimation algorithm can construct nearly optimal
feedback vertex sets for single random graph instances and regular lattices. We
also design a spin glass model for the FVS problem on a directed graph. Our
work will be very useful for identifying the set of vertices that contribute
most significantly to the dynamical complexity of a large networked system.

equivalent ways, e.g., by displacing the vacuum or, explicitly, by their
infinite Poissonian expansion in Fock states. It is well known that these
definitions become inequivalent if applied to finite $d$-level systems
(qudits). We present a comparative Wigner-function description of the qudit CS
defined (i) by the action of the truncated displacement operator on the vacuum
and (ii) by the Poissonian expansion in Fock states of the Glauber CS truncated
at $(d-1)$-photon Fock state. These states can be generated from a classical
light by its optical truncation using nonlinear and linear quantum scissors
devices, respectively. We show a surprising effect that a macroscopically
distinguishable superposition of two qudit CS (according to both definitions)
can be generated with high fidelity by displacing the vacuum in the qudit
Hilbert space. If the qudit dimension $d$ is even (odd) then the superposition
state contains Fock states with only odd (even) photon numbers, which can be
referred to as the odd (even) qudit CS or the female (male) Schr\""odinger cat
state. This phenomenon can be interpreted as an interference of a single CS
with its reflection from the highest-energy Fock state of the Hilbert space, as
clearly seen via phase-space interference of the Wigner function. We also
analyze nonclassical properties of the qudit CS including their photon-number
statistics and nonclassical volume of the Wigner function, which is a
quantitative parameter of nonclassicality (quantumness) of states. Finally, we
study optical tomograms, which can be directly measured in the homodyne
detection of the analyzed qudit cat states and enable the complete
reconstructions of their Wigner functions.

to the outward transport at the far field, localized perturbations may lead to
a highly non-localized response even on the linear level. To overcome this, we
first investigate in detail the dynamics of the solution to the linearized

the full equation up to and including quadratic terms in the nonlinearity. This
approximation utilizes the fact that the non-localized phase response,
resulting from the embedded zero eigenvalues, can be captured, to leading
order, by the nonlinear Burgers equation. The analysis is completed by
obtaining detailed estimates for the resolvent kernel and pointwise estimates
for the Green's function, which allow one to close a nonlinear iteration

data structures, ensuring that every history of invocations and responses of
concurrent operations has a matching sequential history. Existing proofs of
linearisability require one to identify so-called linearisation points within
the operations under consideration, which are atomic statements whose execution
causes the effect of an operation to be felt. However, identification of
linearisation points is a non-trivial task, requiring a high degree of
expertise. For sophisticated algorithms such as Heller et al's lazy set, it
even is possible for an operation to be linearised by the concurrent execution
of a statement outside the operation being verified. This paper proposes an
alternative method for verifying linearisability that does not require
identification of linearisation points. Instead, using an interval-based logic,
we show that every behaviour of each concrete operation over any interval is a
possible behaviour of a corresponding abstraction that executes with
coarse-grained atomicity. This approach is applied to Heller et al's lazy set
to show that verification of linearisability is possible without having to
consider linearisation points within the program code.

seasonal variations are about 1%. Within seasons, we find no evidence for
trends. We speculate that the cause of the seasonal variations could be unknown
field crowding or instrumental artifacts. Our results show that care must be
taken when combining transits throughout different quarters of Kepler data.

profiles show a strong, energy-dependent hard phase lag of up to 0.3 cycles in
phase, or about 4s. Such dramatic energy-dependent lags in the pulse profile
have never before been reported in high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) pulsars.
Previously reported lags have been significantly smaller in phase and
restricted to low-energies (E<10keV). We investigate the possible mechanisms
that might produce this energy-dependent pulse phase shift. We find the most
likely explanation for this effect to be a complex beam geometry.

consist of multiples of Pauli matrices and perform encoding, decoding and

including three super-Earths inside the habitable zone. We present a Bayesian
technique for the analysis of radial velocity (RV) data-sets in the presence of
correlated noise component (""red noise""), with unknown parameters. We also
introduce hyper-parameters in our model in order to deal statistically with
under or over-estimated error bars on measured RVs as well as inconsistencies
between different data-sets. By applying this method to the RV data-set of
GJ667C, we show that this data-set contains a significant correlated (red)
noise component with correlation timescale for HARPS data of order 9 days. Our
analysis shows that the data only provides strong evidence for the presence of
two planets: GJ667Cb and c with periods 7.19d and 28.13d respectively, with
some hints towards the presence of a third signal with period 91d. The
planetary nature of this third signal is not clear and additional RV
observations are required for its confirmation. Previous claims of the
detection of additional planets in this system are due the erroneous assumption
of white noise. Using the standard white noise assumption, our method leads to
the detection of up to five signals in this system. We also find that with the
red noise model, the measurement uncertainties from HARPS for this system are
under-estimated at the level of ~50 per cent.

warming are discussed, contrasting the difference between viewing a trend as
the deterministic response to an external forcing and viewing it as a slow
variation which can be separated from the background spectral continuum of
long-range persistent climate noise. The emphasis in this paper is on the
latter notion, and a general scheme is presented for testing a multi-parameter
trend model against a null hypothesis which models the observed climate record
as an autocorrelated noise. The scheme is employed to the instrumental global
sea-surface temperature record and the global land-temperature record. A trend
model comprising a linear plus an oscillatory trend with period of
approximately 60 yr, and the statistical significance of the trends, are tested
against three different null models: first-order autoregressive process,
fractional Gaussian noise, and fractional Brownian motion. The linear trend is
significant in all cases, but the oscillatory trend is insignificant for ocean
data and barely significant for land data. By means of a Bayesian iteration,
however, using the significance of the linear trend to formulate a sharper null
hypothesis, the oscillatory trend in the land record appears to be
statistically significant. The results suggest that the global land record may
be better suited for detection of the global warming signal than the ocean
record.

simulations that were run using the code \texttt{Isis}, which includes scalar
fields, to analyse the deviation of observables in modified gravity models with
respect to $\Lambda$CDM. Results. We find that due to the presence of the
screening, the deviation is highly dependent on the halo mass. For instance,
the $f(R)$ parameters $|f_{R0}|=10^{-5}$, $n=1$ cause an enhancement of the
gravitational signal by up to 50% for halos with masses between
$10^{13}\,M_\odot h^{-1}$ and $10^{14}\,M_\odot h^{-1}$. The characteristic
mass range where the fifth force is most active varies with the model
parameters. The usual assumption is that the presence of a fifth force leads to
a deeper potential well and thus, a stronger gravitational redshift. However,
we find that in cases in which only the central regions of the halos are
screened, there could also be a weaker gravitational redshift.

the vector meson and diquark interaction channels. We perform this
investigation for two different parameterizations characterized by a different

astrophysical plasmas, including the solar atmosphere. Interaction between
waves and null points has been implicated as a possible mechanism for localised
heating events. Aims: Here we investigate the transient behaviour of the Alfven
wave about fully 3D proper and improper 3D magnetic null points. Previously,
the behaviour of fast magnetoacoustic waves at null points in 3D, cold MHD was
considered by Thurgood & McLaughlin (Astronomy & Astrophysics, 2012, 545, A9).
Methods: We introduce an Alfven wave into the vicinity of both proper and
improper null points by numerically solving the ideal, $\beta=0$ MHD equations
using the LARE3D code. A magnetic fieldline and flux-based coordinate system
permits the isolation of resulting wave-modes and the analysis of their
interaction. Results: We find that the Alfven wave propagates throughout the
region and accumulates near the fan-plane, causing current build up. For
different values of null point eccentricity, the qualitative behaviour changes
only by the imposition of anisotropic pulse dilation, due to the differing
rates at which fieldlines diverge from the spine. For all eccentricities, we
find that the fast and Alfven waves are linearly decoupled. During the driving
phase, an independently propagating fast wave is nonlinearly generated due to
the ponderomotive force. Subsequently, no further excitation of fast waves
occurs. Conclusions: We find that the key aspects of the theory of Alfv\'en
waves about 2D null points extends intuitively to the fully 3D case; i.e. the
wave propagates along fieldlines and thus accumulates at predictable parts of
the topology. We also highlight that unlike in the 2D case, in 3D Alfven-wave
pulses are always toroidal and thus any aspects of 2D Alfven-wave-null models
that are pulse-geometry specific must be reconsidered in 3D.

entirely unfounded. More generally, we urge future researchers to exercise

applications of UWSN such as management of seabed and oil reservoirs,
exploration of deep sea situation and prevention of aqueous disasters. In order

paper, we propose Adaptive mobility of Courier nodes in Threshold-optimized
Depth-based routing (AMCTD), exploring the proficient amendments in depth
threshold and implementing the optimal weight function to achieve longer
network lifetime. We segregate our scheme in 3 major phases of weight updating,
depth threshold variation and adaptive mobility of courier nodes. During data
forwarding, we provide the framework for alterations in threshold to cope with
the sparse condition of network. We ultimately perform detailed simulations to
scrutinize the performance of our proposed scheme and its comparison with other
two notable routing protocols in term of network lifetime and other essential
parameters. The simulations results verify that our scheme performs better than
the other techniques and near to optimal in the field of UWSN.

standard practice to think of a Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$ as an
$n$-dimensional real coordinate space i.e. the space of all $n$-tuples of real

multiplication coordinate-wise. A natural question which arises is if it is
possible to redefine vector operations on the space in such a way that it
acquires some other dimension, say $k$ (over the same field i.e.,
$\mathbb{R}$). In this paper, we answer the question in the affirmative, for
all $k\in\mathbb{N}$. We achieve the required dimension by `dragging' the
structure of a standard $k$-dimensional Euclidean space (\R{k}) on the
$n$-tuple of real numbers ($R^n$). At the heart of the argument is Cantor's
counterintuitive result that $\mathbb{R}$ is numerically equivalent to
$\mathbb{R}^n$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$, which can be proved through an elegant

\cite{Teleman_arXiv_III}, \S 2; we construct the local $K$- theory level of the
index formula. Our construction is sufficiently general to encompass the
algebra of pseudo-differential operators of order zero on smooth manifolds,
elliptic pseudo-differential operators of order zero, their abstract symbol
(see Introduction \S 2.) and their local $K$- theory analytical and topological
index classes, see \cite{Teleman_arXiv_III}, \S 5, Definition 5 and 6. Our
definitions are sufficiently general to apply to exact sequences of singular
integral operators, which are of interest in the case of the index theorem on
Lipschitz and quasi-conformal manifolds, see \cite{Teleman_IHES},
\cite{Teleman_Acta}, \cite{Donaldson_Sullivan}, \cite{Connes_Sullivan_Teleman}.
In this article we introduce localised algebras (Definition 3) $\mathit{A}$ and
in \S 6 we define their local algebraic $K$-theory. A localised algebra
$\mathit{A}$ is an algebra in which a decreasing filtration by vector
sub-spaces $\mathit{A}_{\mu}$ is introduced. The filtration $\mathit{A}_{\mu}$
induces a filtration on the space of matrices $\mathbb{M}(\mathit{A}_{\mu})$.
Although we define solely $K^{loc}_{\ast}(\mathit{A})$ for $\ast= 0, \; 1$, we
expect our construction could be extended in higher degrees. We stress that our
construction of $K^{loc}_{0}(\mathit{A})$ uses exclusively idempotent matrices
and that the use of finite projective modules is totally avoided. (Idempotent
matrices, rather than projective modules, contain less arbitrariness in the
description of the $K_{0}$ classes and allow a better filtration control). The
group $K^{loc}_{0}(\mathit{A})$ is by definition the quotient space of the
space of the Grothendieck completion of the space of idempotent matrices
through three equivalence relations: -i) stabilisation $\sim_{s}$, -2) local
conjugation $\sim_{l}$, {\em and} -3) projective limit with respect to the
filtration. By definition, the $K_{1}^{loc} (\mathit{A})$ is the projective
limit of the local $K_{1}(\mathit{A}_{\mu})$ groups. The group
$K_{1}(\mathit{A}_{\mu})$ is by definition the quotient of
$\mathbb{GL}(\mathit{A}_{\mu})$ modulo the equivalence relation generated by:
-1) stabilisation $\sim_{s}$, --2) local conjugation $\sim_{l}$ and -3)
$\sim_{\mathbb{O}(\mathit{A}_{\mu})}$, where $\mathbb{O}(\mathit{A}_{\mu})$ is
the sub-module generated by elements of the form $ u \oplus u^{-1} $, for any
$u \in \mathbb{GL}(\mathit{A}_{\mu})$. The class of any invertible element $u$
modulo conjugation (inner auto-morphisms) we call the Jordan canonical form of
$u$. The local conjugation preserves the local Jordan canonical form of
invertible elements. The equivalence relation
$\sim_{\mathbb{O}(\mathit{A}_{\mu})}$ insures existence of opposite elements in
$K_{1}(\mathit{A}_{\mu})$ and $K_{1}^{loc}(\mathit{A})$. Our definition of
$K^{loc}_{1}(\mathit{A})$ does not use the commutator sub-group
$[\mathbb{GL}(\mathit{A}), \mathbb{GL}(\mathit{A})]$ nor elementary matrices in
its construction. We define short exact sequences of localised algebras. To get
the corresponding (open) six terms exact sequence (Theorem 51) one has to take
the tensor product of the expected six terms exact sequence by
$\mathbb{Z}[\frac{1}{2}]$. We expect the factor
$\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}[\frac{1}{2}}]$ to have important consequences. Our work
shows that the basic structure of $K_{1}$ resides in the {\em additive}
sub-group generated by elements of the form $u \oplus u^{-1}$, $u \in
\mathbb{GL}(\mathit{A})$, rather than in the {\em multiplicativ} commutator
sub-group $[\mathbb{GL}(\mathit{A}), \mathbb{GL}(\mathit{A})]$. Even into the
case of trivially filtered algebras, $\mathit{A}_{\mu} = \mathit{A}$, for all
$\mu \in \mathbb{N}$, the introduced group $K^{loc}_{1}(\mathit{A})$ should
provide more information than the classical group $K_{1}(\mathit{A})$.

the Ginzburg-Landau equation in bounded domains, where the Laplacian is

we show that solutions with uniformly bounded energy converge weakly to sphere
valued 1/2-harmonic maps, i.e., the fractional analogues of the usual harmonic
maps. In addition, the convergence holds in smooth functions spaces away from a
(n-1)-rectifiable closed set of finite (n-1)-Hausdorff measure. The proof
relies on the representation of the square root Laplacian as a
Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator in one more dimension, and on the analysis of a
boundary version of the Ginzburg-Landau equation. Besides the analysis of the
fractional Ginzburg-Landau equation, we also give a general partial regularity
result for stationary 1/2-harmonic maps in arbitrary dimension.

integrates manifold regularization and multi-view regularization into the usual
formulation of SVMs and is a natural extension of SVMs from supervised learning
to multi-view semi-supervised learning. The function optimization problem in a
reproducing kernel Hilbert space is converted to an optimization in a
finite-dimensional Euclidean space. After providing a theoretical bound for the
generalization performance of the proposed method, we further give a
formulation of the empirical Rademacher complexity which affects the bound
significantly. From this bound and the empirical Rademacher complexity, we can
gain insights into the roles played by different regularization terms to the
generalization performance. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world
data sets are presented, which validate the effectiveness of the proposed
multi-view Laplacian SVMs approach.

types provide the most habitable real estate --- defined to be locations where
liquid water could be present on Earth-like planets. Stellar temperatures and
radii are determined by fitting model spectra to spatially resolved broad-band
photometric energy distributions for stars in the sample. The locations of the
HZ's are calculated using an empirical formula for planetary surface
temperature and assuming the condition of liquid water, called here the
empirical habitable zone, or EHZ. Systems that have dynamically disruptive
companions, assuming a 5:1 separation ratios for primary/secondary pairs and
either object and a planet, are considered not habitable. We then derive a
simple formula to predict the location of the EHZ for main sequence stars based
on V-K color. We consider EHZ widths as more useful measures of the habitable
real estate around stars than areas because multiple planets are not expected
to orbit stars at identical stellar distances. This EHZ provides a qualitative
guide on where to expect the largest population of planets in the HZ of main
sequence stars. M stars provide more EHZ real estate than other spectral types,
possessing 36.5% of the habitable real estate en masse. K stars are second with
21.5%, while A, F, and G stars offer 18.5%, 6.9% and 16.6%, respectively. Our
calculations show that three M dwarfs within 10 pc harbor planets in their
EHZs. GJ 581 may have two planets (d with msini = 6.1 M_E; g with msini = 3.1

for the existence of inter-cisternal exchange both for small membrane proteins

SWAP, a theoretical concept which, in combination with the tool of

us to estimate physical properties of the black boxes from the observed

device-independent self-testing of non-maximally entangled two-qutrit states in
the CGLMP scenario (for which Jordan's Lemma does not apply) and the
device-independent certification of entangled measurements. We further apply
the SWAP method to relate nonlocal correlations to work extraction and quantum
dimensionality, hence demonstrating that this tool can be used to study a wide
variety of properties relying on the sole knowledge of accessible statistics.

show that the observed behavior could be a direct consequence of the coupling
of the phonons with the electronic excitations in the anisotropic magnetic

coupled to phonons via the dependence of the Slater-Koster parameters on the As
position. We identify two qualitatively different channels of the
electron-phonon interaction: a geometrical one related to the Fe-As-Fe angle

biomedical parameters. In this study, a protocol named Distance Aware Relaying
Energy-efficient (DARE) to monitor patients in multi-hop Body Area Sensor
Networks (BASNs) is proposed. The protocol operates by investigating the ward
of a hospital comprising of eight patients, under different topologies by
positioning the sink at different locations or making it static or mobile.
Seven sensors are attached to each patient, measuring different parameters of
Electrocardiogram (ECG), pulse rate, heart rate, temperature level, glucose
level, toxins level and motion. To reduce the energy consumption, these sensors
communicate with the sink via an on-body relay, affixed on the chest of each
patient. The body relay possesses higher energy resources as compared to the
body sensors as, they perform aggregation and relaying of data to the sink
node. A comparison is also conducted conducted with another protocol of BAN
named, Mobility-supporting Adaptive Threshold-based Thermal-aware
Energy-efficient Multi-hop ProTocol (M-ATTEMPT). The simulation results show
that, the proposed protocol achieves increased network lifetime and efficiently
reduces the energy consumption, in relative to M-ATTEMPT protocol.

X-rays from a CIR structure. We show that a CIR has the potential to account

elastic-magnetic stellar models, mainly with a view to relating the observed

this programme by considering several new physical mechanisms that are likely
to be important for magnetar oscillations. These relate to the
superfluid/superconducting nature of the stellar interior, and the damping of
the modes, both through internal dissipation mechanisms and the launching of
waves into the magnetosphere. We make simple order-of-magnitude estimates to
show that both the frequencies and the damping time of magnetar oscillations
can evolve in time, identifying three distinct `pathways' that can be followed,
depending upon the initial magnitude of the mode excitation. These results are
interesting as they show that the information buried in magnetar QPOs may be
even richer than previously thought, and motivate more careful examination of
magnetar light curves, to search for signatures of the different types of

implement quantum communications and quantum clocks at regimes where relativity
starts to kick in. However, typical setups do not take into account the effects

fitting parameters whose values tend to be elusive, especially in
inter-organizational studies. To allow interpretation of these parameters and
better understand such distribution behavior, we present a statistical
mechanical approach based on an analogy between the classical particles of a
statistical mechanical organization and the number of distinct words in a
textual organization. With this derivation, we achieve a transformed
(generalized) form of the MA model, termed the statistical mechanical
Menzerath-Altmann (SMMA) model. This novel transformed model consists of four
parameters, one of which is a structure-dependent input parameter, and three of
which are free-fitting parameters. Using distinct word data sets from two text
corpora, we verified that the SMMA model describes the same distribution as the
MA model. We propose that the additional structure-dependent parameter of the
SMMA model converts the three fitting parameters into structure-independent
parameters. Moreover, the parameters of the SMMA model are associated with a
corresponding physical interpretation that can lead to characterization of an
organization' s thermodynamic properties. We also propose that many
organizations presenting MA law behavior, whether linguistic or not, can be
examined by the SMMA distribution model through the properly defined structural
degeneracy parameter and the energy associated states.

of space in the adiabatic limit is investigated. Based on the Caputo definition
of a fractional derivative using the fractional quantum harmonic oscillator a
model is presented, which describes space generation as a dynamic process,
where the dimension $d$ of space evolves smoothly with time in the range 0 <=
d(t) <=3, where the lower and upper boundaries of dimension are derived from
first principles. It is demonstrated, that a minimum threshold for the space
dimension is necessary to establish an interaction with external probe
particles. A possible application in cosmology is suggested.

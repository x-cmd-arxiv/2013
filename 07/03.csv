field model having a moduli space of BPS topological defects. In a
$(1+1)$-dimensional space-time the defects are classically degenerate in mass
kinks, but in $(3+1)$ dimensions the kinks become BPS domain walls, all of them
sharing the same surface tension at the classical level. The heat kernel/zeta
function regularization method will be used to control the divergences induced
by the quantum kink and domain wall fluctuations. A generalization of the
Gilkey-DeWitt-Avramidi heat kernel expansion will be developed in order to
accommodate the infrared divergences due to zero modes in the spectra of the
second-order kink and domain wall fluctuation operators, which are respectively
$N\times N$ matrix ordinary or partial differential operators. Use of these
tools in the spectral zeta function associated with the Hessian operators paves
the way to obtain general formulas for the one-loop kink mass and domain wall
tension shifts in any $(1+1)$- or $(3+1)$-dimensional $N$-component scalar
field theory model. Application of these formulae to the BPS kinks or domain
walls of the $N=2$ model mentioned above reveals the breaking of the classical
mass or surface tension degeneracy at the quantum level. Because the main
parameter distinguishing each member in the BPS kink or domain wall moduli
space is essentially the distance between the centers of two basic kinks or
walls, the breaking of the degeneracy amounts to the surge in quantum-induced
forces between the two constituent topological defects. The differences in
surface tension induced by one-loop fluctuations of BPS walls give rise mainly
to attractive forces between the constituent walls except if the two basic
walls are very far apart. Repulsive forces between two close walls only arise
if the coupling is approaches the critical value from below.

atoms all condense in the $m=0$ state along the field direction. We calculate
the average value and variance of the Zeeman state $m=0$ to illustrate clearly

modifying gravity. We find that the ensuing rainbow gravity theory is such that
gravity switches off at high energy (or at least leads to a universal conformal
coupling). This explains why the fluctuations are scale-invariant on all
scales: there is no horizon scale as such. For dispersion relations that do not
lead to exact scale invariance we find instead esoteric inflation in the

are attached to the points of a stationary Poisson point process. For a
stationary Boolean model with convex grains we consider a recently developed
collection of shape descriptors, the so called Minkowski tensors. By combining
spatial and probabilistic averaging we define Minkowski tensor densities of a
Boolean model. These densities are global characteristics of the union set
which can be estimated from observations. In contrast local characteristics
like the mean Minkowski tensor of a single random particle cannot be observed
directly, since the particles overlap. We relate the global to the local
properties by density formulas for the Minkowski tensors. These density
formulas generalize the well known formulas for intrinsic volume densities and
are obtained by applying results from translative integral geometry. For an

proportional to the intrinsic volume densities, whereas for a non-isotropic
Boolean model this is usually not the case. Our results support the idea that
the degree of anisotropy of a Boolean model may be expressed in terms of the
Minkowski tensor densities. Furthermore we observe that for smooth grains the
mean curvature radius function of a particle can be reconstructed from the
Minkowski tensor densities. In a simulation study we determine numerically
Minkowski tensor densities for non-isotropic Boolean models based on ellipses

characterize the orientational distribution of the grains and to estimate model
parameters for non-isotropic distributions.

that the inner shell contains 1.7+/-0.6 Msun of gas. Assuming a similar
dust-to-gas ratio for the outer nebula, the total mass ejected by WRAY 15-751
amounts to 4+/-2 Msun. The measured abundances, masses and kinematic ages of
the nebulae were used to constrain the evolution of the star and the epoch at
which the nebulae were ejected. Our results point to an ejection of the nebulae
during the RSG evolutionary phase of an ~ 40 Msun star. The presence of
multiple shells around the star suggests that the mass-loss was not a
continuous ejection but rather a series of episodes of extreme mass-loss. Our
measurements are compatible with the recent evolutionary tracks computed for an
40 Msun star with little rotation. They support the O-BSG-RSG-YSG-LBV filiation
and the idea that high-luminosity and low-luminosity LBVs follow different
evolutionary paths.

information of the high density regions of the core ($n\lesssim 10^5$
cm$^{-3}$), missed in previous works due to the depletion of the species
observed (e.g. CS). The obtained maps show different kinematical signatures
between the eastern and western parts of the core, suggesting a possible
dynamical interaction of the core with the HH 80/81/80N outflow. The analysis
of the Position-Velocity (PV) plots of these species rules out a previous
interpretation of having a molecular ring-like structure of $6\times 10^4$ AU
of radius traced by CS infalling onto a central protostar found in the core
(IRS1). High degree of deuteration, with respect to the central part of the
core harboring IRS1, is derived in the eastern part, where a dust condensation
(SE) is located. This deuteration trend of NH3 suggests that SE is in a
prestellar evolutionary stage, earlier than that of the IRS1. Since SE is the
closest condensation to the HH 80N/81/80N outflow, in case of having
outflow-core dynamical interaction, it should be perturbed first and be the
most evolved condensation in the core. Therefore, the derived evolutionary
sequence for SE and IRS1 makes the outflow triggered star formation on IRS1
unlikely.

directions with respect to the local mean magnetic field. In addition to the
previous comparative analysis, here the entire 3D wave-vector spectrum of the

oblique firehose instability and the relatively poorly known ordinary-mode

a threshold lower than the parallel firehose instability and lower than the
ordinary-mode instability. For larger anisotropies, the ordinary mode can grow
faster, with maximum growth rates exceeding the ones of the oblique firehose
instability. In contrast to previous studies that claimed a possible activity
of the ordinary-mode in the small $\beta [< 1]$ regimes, here it is rigorously
shown that only the large $\beta [> 1]$ regimes are susceptible to these

and allows superb signal reconstruction from relatively few measurements. Based
on CS theory, a suitable dictionary for sparse representation of the signal is
required. In diffusion MRI (dMRI), CS methods were proposed to reconstruct
diffusion-weighted signal and the Ensemble Average Propagator (EAP), and there
are two kinds of Dictionary Learning (DL) methods: 1) Discrete Representation
DL (DR-DL), and 2) Continuous Representation DL (CR-DL). DR-DL is susceptible
to numerical inaccuracy owing to interpolation and regridding errors in a
discretized q-space. In this paper, we propose a novel CR-DL approach, called
Dictionary Learning - Spherical Polar Fourier Imaging (DL-SPFI) for effective
compressed-sensing reconstruction of the q-space diffusion-weighted signal and
the EAP. In DL-SPFI, an dictionary that sparsifies the signal is learned from
the space of continuous Gaussian diffusion signals. The learned dictionary is
then adaptively applied to different voxels using a weighted LASSO framework
for robust signal reconstruction. The adaptive dictionary is proved to be
optimal. Compared with the start-of-the-art CR-DL and DR-DL methods proposed by
Merlet et al. and Bilgic et al., espectively, our work offers the following
advantages. First, the learned dictionary is proved to be optimal for Gaussian
diffusion signals. Second, to our knowledge, this is the first work to learn a
voxel-adaptive dictionary. The importance of the adaptive dictionary in EAP
reconstruction will be demonstrated theoretically and empirically. Third,
optimization in DL-SPFI is only performed in a small subspace resided by the
SPF coefficients, as opposed to the q-space approach utilized by Merlet et al.
The experiment results demonstrate the advantages of DL-SPFI over the original
SPF basis and Bilgic et al.'s method.

cosmic microwave background (CMB), to grow into the present day astronomical
structures is well established, under Newtonian and Einsteinian gravity. It is
hence customary to assume the existence of an underlying dark matter component
with density fluctuations, $\Delta(M)$, having amplitudes much larger than what
CMB observations imply for the baryons. This is in fact one of the recurrent
arguments used in support of the dark matter hypothesis. In this letter we
prove that the same extended theory of gravity which has been recently shown to
accurately reproduce gravitational lensing observations, in absence of any dark
matter, and which in the low velocity regime converges to a MONDian force law,
implies a sufficiently amplified self-gravity to allow purely baryonic
fluctuations with amplitudes in accordance with CMB constraints to naturally
grow into the $z=0$ astrophysical structures detected. The linear structure
formation scenario which emerges closely resembles the standard concordance
cosmology one, as abundantly calibrated over the last decade to match multiple
observational constraints at various redshifts. However, in contrast with what
occurs in the concordance cosmology, this follows not from a critical
dependence on initial conditions and the fine tuning of model parameters, but
from the rapid convergence of highly arbitrary initial conditions onto a well
defined $\Delta(M,z)$ attractor solution.

epsilon-neighborhoods of orbits of parabolic germs. The article is motivated by
the question of analytic classification using epsilon-neighborhoods of orbits
in the simplest formal class. We show that the coefficient in front of
epsilon^2 term in the asymptotic expansion in epsilon, which we call the
principal part of the area, is a sectorially analytic function of initial point
of the orbit. It satisfies a cohomological equation similar to the standard
trivialization equation for parabolic diffeomorphisms. We give necessary and
sufficient conditions on a diffeomorphism f for the existence of globally
analytic solution of this equation. Furthermore, we introduce new
classification type for diffeomorphisms implied by this new equation and
investigate the relative position of its classes with respect to the analytic
classes.

applications requiring analysis of large amounts of correlated and
high-dimensional data produced by multiple distributed data sources. We propose
a distributed online data classification framework where data is gathered by
distributed data sources and processed by a heterogeneous set of distributed
learners which learn online, at run-time, how to classify the different data
streams either by using their locally available classification functions or by
helping each other by classifying each other's data. Importantly, since the
data is gathered at different locations, sending the data to another learner to
process incurs additional costs such as delays, and hence this will be only
beneficial if the benefits obtained from a better classification will exceed
the costs. We model the problem of joint classification by the distributed and
heterogeneous learners from multiple data sources as a distributed contextual
bandit problem where each data is characterized by a specific context. We
develop a distributed online learning algorithm for which we can prove
sublinear regret. Compared to prior work in distributed online data mining, our
work is the first to provide analytic regret results characterizing the
performance of the proposed algorithm.

polarisation signals show no overall variation in the fraction of selected

also show no significant variation. Our results show that the ubiquitous

However, recent very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI), obtained during radio
outbursts of SS Cyg, has yielded a significantly larger absolute parallax of
8.80+/-0.12 mas, as well as a large difference in the direction of the proper
motion compared to the HST result. The VLBI distance reduces the implied
luminosity of SS Cyg by about a factor of two, giving good agreement with
predictions based on accretion-disk theory in order to explain the observed DN
outburst behavior. This discrepancy raises the possibility of significant
systematic errors in FGS parallaxes and proper motions. We have reanalyzed the
archival HST/FGS data, including (1) a critical redetermination of the
parallaxes of the background astrometric reference stars, (2) updated input
values of the reference-star proper motions, and (3) correction of the position
measurements for color-dependent shifts. Our new analysis yields a proper
motion of SS Cyg that agrees well with the VLBI motion, and an absolute
parallax of 8.30+/-0.41 mas, also statistically concordant with the VLBI result
at the ~1.2 sigma level. Our results suggest that HST/FGS parallaxes are free
of large systematic errors, when the data are reduced using high-quality input
values for the astrometry of the reference stars, and when instrumental
signatures are properly removed.

  We develop two complementary approaches for studying q-twisted states in the

buying a commodity when it is cheap and selling it when it is expensive. Our
particular concern is with the management of energy systems, although the
results are generally applicable. We consider a model which may account for
nonlinear cost functions, market impact, input and output rate constraints and
inefficiencies or losses in the storage process. We develop an algorithm which
is maximally efficient in then sense that it incorporates the result that, at
each point in time, the optimal management decision depends only a finite, and
typically short, time horizon. We give examples related to the management of a
real-world system.

tensor- Singular Value Decomposition (t-SVD)[1], which is a group theoretic
framework for tensor decomposition. In contrast to popular existing tensor
decomposition techniques such as higher-order SVD (HOSVD), t-SVD has optimality
properties similar to the truncated SVD for matrices. Based on t-SVD, we first
construct novel tensor-rank like measures to characterize informational and
structural complexity of multilinear data. Following that we outline a
complexity penalized algorithm for tensor completion from missing entries. As
an application, 3-D and 4-D (color) video data compression and recovery are
considered. We show that videos with linear camera motion can be represented
more efficiently using t-SVD compared to traditional approaches based on
vectorizing or flattening of the tensors. Application of the proposed tensor
completion algorithm for video recovery from missing entries is shown to yield
a superior performance over existing methods. In conclusion we point out
several research directions and implications to online prediction of

separation. Follow-up observations of the 66 candidates with projected
separation < 500 AU show that all of them are background objects. To establish
statistical constraints on the underlying giant planet population based on our
imaging data, we have developed a new Bayesian formalism that incorporates (1)
non-detections, (2) single-epoch candidates, (3) astrometric and (4)
photometric information, and (5) the possibility of multiple planets per star

planet beyond 80 AU, and <21% of debris disk stars have a >3MJup planet outside
of 40 AU, based on hot-start evolutionary models. We model the population of
directly-imaged planets as d^2N/dMda ~ m^alpha a^beta, where m is planet mass
and a is orbital semi-major axis (with a maximum value of amax). We find that
beta < -0.8 and/or alpha > 1.7. Likewise, we find that beta < -0.8 and/or amax
< 200 AU. If we ignore the Beta Pic and HR 8799 planets (should they belong to
a rare and distinct group), we find that < 20% of debris disk stars have a >
3MJup planet beyond 10 AU, and beta < -0.8 and/or alpha < -1.5. Our Bayesian
constraints are not strong enough to reveal any dependence of the planet
frequency on stellar host mass. Studies of transition disks have suggested that
about 20% of stars are undergoing planet formation; our non-detections at large
separations show that planets with orbital separation > 40 AU and planet masses

about 1.5 times larger than the values for long GRBs, core-collapse supernovae,

r_e, and only ~25% are located within 1 r_e. We further find that short GRBs
severely under-represent their hosts' rest-frame optical and UV light, with
~30-45% of the bursts located in regions of their host galaxies that have no
detectable stellar light, and ~55% in the regions with no UV light. Therefore,
short GRBs do not occur in regions of star formation or even stellar mass. This
demonstrates that the progenitor systems of short GRBs must migrate from their
birth sites to their eventual explosion sites, a signature of kicks in compact
object binary systems. Utilizing the full sample of offsets, we estimate natal
kick velocities of ~20-140 km s^-1. These independent lines of evidence provide
the strongest support to date that short GRBs result from the merger of compact

  Methods. Using the popular CPL parametrization of the dark energy, w = w0
+wa(1-a), we generate mock SN Ia samples that can be projected out to higher
redshifts. The synthetic datasets thus generated are fitted to the CPL model,
and we evaluate the improvement that a high-z sample can add in terms of
ameliorating the statistical and systematic uncertainties on cosmological
parameters.
  Results. In an optimistic but still very achievable scenario, we find that
extending the HST sample beyond CANDELS+CLASH to reach a total of 28 SN Ia at z
> 1.0 could improve the uncertainty in the wa parameter by up to 21%. The
corresponding improvement in the figure of merit (FoM) would be as high as 28%.
Finally, we consider the use of high-redshift SN Ia samples to detect
non-cosmological evolution in SN Ia luminosities with redshift, finding that
such tests could be undertaken by future spacebased infrared surveys using the
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).

circumnuclear disks. We track the orbital decay of the light, secondary black
hole $M_{\bullet2}$ orbiting around the more massive primary at the center of
the disk, using $N$-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations. We find
that the gravitational interaction of $M_{\bullet2}$ with massive clumps
$M_{\rm cl}$ erratically perturbs the otherwise smooth orbital decay. In close
encounters with massive clumps, gravitational slingshots can kick the secondary
black hole out of the disk plane. The black hole moving on an inclined orbit
then experiences the weaker dynamical friction of the stellar background,
resulting in a longer orbital decay timescale. Interactions between clumps can
also favor orbital decay when the black hole is captured by a massive clump
which is segregating toward the center of the disk. The stochastic behavior of
the black hole orbit emerges mainly when the ratio $M_{\bullet2}/M_{\rm cl}$
falls below unity, with decay timescales ranging from $\sim1$ to $\sim50$ Myr.
This suggests that describing the cold clumpy phase of the inter-stellar medium
in self-consistent simulations of galaxy mergers, albeit so far neglected, is

discovery and towards characterization. Perhaps the most basic parameter of an
extrasolar planet is its mass; however, this is very difficult to determine if
the planet does not transit the star. The radial velocity technique, still the
most fruitful method of discovering planets in the solar neighborhood, can only
determine a minimum planet mass. We investigate a method using the near-future
IGRINS near infrared spectrograph to detect the orbital motion of the planet
itself. We simulate several observations of a star with an orbiting planet, and
search for the spectral signature of the planet by cross-correlating against
planet model spectra. A detection appears as a strong peak in the
cross-correlation function, and gives the radial velocity of the planet at the
time of observation. This, combined with the motion of the star from
traditional radial velocity planet search programs, can determine the actual
planet mass. We find that the IGRINS instrument can detect the spectral
signature from large planets on very close orbits (so-called Hot Jupiters), and
that the detections can provide tight constraints on the true planet mass.

0.176 mag. Of the 226 low-z objects in our sample, 91 objects are from LOSS,

with a cosmological constant. Our data prefer a Universe with an accelerating

a function of host-galaxy morphology, we do not see evidence for a significant
trend, although we find a somewhat reduced scatter in Hubble residuals from SNe
residing within a projected distance < 10 kpc of the host-galaxy nucleus

for the structure functions at very low x and high virtualities Q^2, and for
the exclusive diffractive vector meson and DVCS production at high t. This can
be traced back to the different power-law behavior of the saturation scale in
x, and to a different impact-parameter b dependence of the saturation scale in
these models. Nevertheless, both models give approximately similar saturation

the same conclusion that the typical impact-parameter probed in the total

environment. In cluster cores, early type galaxies dominate, whereas
star-forming galaxies are more and more common in the outskirts. At higher
redshifts and in somewhat less dense environments (e.g. galaxy groups), the
situation is less clear. One open issue is that of whether and how the star
formation rate (SFR) of galaxies in groups depends on the distance from the
centre of mass. To shed light on this topic, we have built a sample of X-ray
selected galaxy groups at 0<z<1.6 in various blank fields (ECDFS, COSMOS,
GOODS). We use a sample of spectroscopically confirmed group members with
stellar mass M >10^10.3 M_sun in order to have a high spectroscopic
completeness. As we use only spectroscopic redshifts, our results are not
affected by uncertainties due to projection effects. We use several SFR
indicators to link the star formation (SF) activity to the galaxy environment.
Taking advantage of the extremely deep mid-infrared Spitzer MIPS and
far-infrared Herschel PACS observations, we have an accurate, broad-band
measure of the SFR for the bulk of the star-forming galaxies. We use
multi-wavelength SED fitting techniques to estimate the stellar masses of all
objects and the SFR of the MIPS and PACS undetected galaxies. We analyse the
dependence of the SF activity, stellar mass and specific SFR on the
group-centric distance, up to z~1.6, for the first time. We do not find any
correlation between the mean SFR and group-centric distance at any redshift. We
do not observe any strong mass segregation either, in agreement with
predictions from simulations. Our results suggest that either groups have a
much smaller spread in accretion times with respect to the clusters and that
the relaxation time is longer than the group crossing time.

from deterministic to proba- babilistic information. Probabilistic databases
contain tuples that may or may not exist with some probability. As a result,
the number of possible deterministic database instances that can be observed
from a probabilistic database grows exponentially with the number of

aggregate and non-aggregate queries on massive probabilistic databases. We
adopt the tuple independence model, in which each tuple is assigned a
probability value. We develop a method that exploits Probability Generating

polynomial for each tuple. It incrementally builds a master polynomial that
expresses the distribution of the possible result values precisely. We also
develop an approximation method that finds the distribution of the result value
with negligible errors. Our experiments suggest that our methods are orders of
magnitude faster than the most recent systems that answer such queries,
including MayBMS and SPROUT. In our experiments, we were able to scale up to
several terabytes of data on TPC- H queries, while existing methods could only
run for a few gigabytes of data on the same queries.

the classical equilibrium statistical mechanics of directed polymers in two

spatial dimension, originally exploited by P.-G. de Gennes [J.\ Chem.\ Phys.\
{\bf 48}, 2257 (1968)]. Known results concerning two exactly solvable
microscopic models of quantum particles moving in one spatial dimension---the
Lieb-Liniger model of contact interactions and the Calogero-Sutherland model of
long-range interactions---are used to shed light on the behavior of the
corresponding polymeric systems. In addition, the technique of bosonization is
used to reveal how generic polymer interactions give rise to an emergent
polymer fluid that has universal collective excitations. Comparison of the
response to topological constraints of a fluid of simply noncrossing (i.e.,
noncrossing but otherwise noninteracting) directed polymers, explored in a
companion Paper, to the response of a generically interacting directed polymer
fluid reveals that the structure is quantitatively unchanged by the generic
interactions on the line transverse to the pin, and is qualitatively unchanged
by the generic interactions throughout the two dimensions of the system's
extent. Furthermore, the free-energy cost associated with a pin that partitions
a system having generic interactions is found to be proportional to the
pin-partitioning cost for a system of simply noncrossing polymers.

the accreted gas, in terms of whether it entered the galaxy during a merger
event or was smoothly accreted. Furthermore, we designate whether the smoothly
accreted gas is accreted via a cold flow or is shocked upon entry into the
halo. For moderate-mass (10^6 - 10^7 Msun) black holes at z ~ 4, there is a
preference to accrete cold flow gas than gas of shocked or merger origin.
However, this result is a consequence of the fact that the entire galaxy has a
higher fraction of gas from cold flows. In general, each black hole tends to
accrete the same fractions of smooth- and merger-accreted gas as is contained
in its host galaxy, suggesting that once gas enters a halo it becomes
well-mixed, and its origins are erased. We find that the angular momentum of
the gas upon halo entry is a more important factor; black holes preferentially
accrete gas that had low angular momentum when it entered the galaxy,
regardless of whether it was accreted smoothly or through mergers.

mathematical modeling of the bistability phenomenon has been at the focus of
researches in quantitative and system biology. Recent study shows that Boolean
networks offer relative simple mathematical models that are capable of
capturing these essential information. Thus a better understanding of the
Boolean networks with bistability property is desirable for both theoretical
and application purposes. In this paper, we describe an algebraic condition for
the number of stable states (fixed points) of a Boolean network based on its
polynomial representation, and derive algorithms for a Boolean network to have
a single stable state or two stable states. As an example, we also construct a
Boolean network with exactly two stable states for the lac operon's

measurements required to successfully reconstruct a signal drawn from a
Gaussian mixture model in the low-noise regime. The method is to develop upper
and lower bounds that are a function of the maximum dimension of the linear
subspaces spanned by the Gaussian mixture components. The method not only
reveals the existence or absence of a minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) error
floor (phase transition) but also provides insight into the MMSE decay via
multivariate generalizations of the MMSE dimension and the MMSE power offset,
which are a function of the interaction between the geometrical properties of
the kernel and the Gaussian mixture. These results apply not only to standard
linear random Gaussian measurements but also to linear kernels that minimize
the MMSE. It is shown that optimal kernels do not change the number of
measurements associated with the MMSE phase transition, rather they affect the
sensed power required to achieve a target MMSE in the low-noise regime.
Overall, our bounds are tighter and sharper than standard bounds on the minimum
number of measurements needed to recover sparse signals associated with a union
of subspaces model, as they are not asymptotic in the signal dimension or

and west side of L1521F-IRS with a lobe size of ~1000 AU. The estimated outflow
mass, maximum outflow velocity, and outflow force are (9.0-80)x10^{-4} M_{sol},
7.2 km s^{-1}, and (7.4-66)x10^{-7} M_{sol} km s^{-1} yr^{-1}, respectively.
The estimated outflow parameters such as size, mass, and momentum rate are
similar to values derived for other VeLLOs, and are located at the lower end of
values compared to previously studied outflows associated with low- to
high-mass star forming regions. Low-velocity less collimated (1.5 km
s^{-1}/1200 AU) and higher-velocity compact (4.0 km s^{-1}/920 AU) outflow
components are suggested by the data. These velocity structures are not
consistent with those expected in the jet driven or wind driven outflow models,
perhaps suggesting a remnant outflow from the FHSC as well as an undeveloped
outflow from the protostar. Detection of an infrared source and compact
millimeter continuum emission suggest the presence of the protostar, while its
low bolometric luminosity (0.034-0.07 L$_{\odot}$), and small outflow, suggests
that L1521F is in the earliest protostellar stage ($<10^{4}$ yr) and contains a
substellar mass object. The bolometric (or internal) luminosity of L1521F-IRS
suggests that the current mass accretion rate is an order-of-magnitude lower
than expected in the standard mass accretion model (~10^{-6} M_{sol} yr^{-1}),
which may imply that L1521F-IRS is currently in a low activity phase.

temperature properties, similar to that found in amorphous solids. Recently a
two-TLS (two-level system) model was derived based on the microscopic
characteristics of disordered lattices. Within the two-TLS model the
quantitative universality of phonon attenuation, and the energy scale of $1-3$
K below which universality is observed, are derived as a consequence of the
existence of two types of TLSs, differing by their interaction with the phonon
field. In this paper we calculate analytically and numerically the densities of
states (DOS) of the weakly and strongly interacting TLSs. We find that the DOS
of the former can be well described by a Gaussian, whereas the DOS of the
latter have a power law correlation gap at low energies, with an intriguing
dependence of the power on the short distance cutoff of the interaction. Both
behaviors are markedly different from the logarithmic gap exhibited by a single
species of interacting TLSs. Our analytical results are verified against
extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Our results support the notion that it is
the weakly interacting $\tau$-TLSs that dictate the standard low temperature
glassy physics. Yet, the power-law DOS we find for the $S$-TLSs enables the
prediction of a number of deviations from the universal glassy behavior that
can be tested experimentally. Possible relevance of our results to recent
experimental findings in hydrogenated amorphous films, and more generally to
amorphous systems, is discussed.

are accumulating, there are many reasons to constrain the data analyses. One
approach to such constrained analyses is to focus on select subsets of gene
families that are particularly well suited for the tasks at hand. Such gene
families have generally been referred to as marker genes. We are particularly
interested in identifying and using such marker genes for phylogenetic and
phylogeny-driven ecological studies of microbes and their communities. We
therefore refer to these as PhyEco (for phylogenetic and phylogenetic ecology)
markers. The dual use of these PhyEco markers means that we needed to develop
and apply a set of somewhat novel criteria for identification of the best
candidates for such markers. The criteria we focused on included universality
across the taxa of interest, ability to be used to produce robust phylogenetic
trees that reflect as much as possible the evolution of the species from which
the genes come, and low variation in copy number across taxa. We describe here
an automated protocol for identifying potential PhyEco markers from a set of
complete genome sequences. The protocol combines rapid searching, clustering
and phylogenetic tree building algorithms to generate protein families that
meet the criteria listed above. We report here the identification of PhyEco
markers for different taxonomic levels including 40 for all bacteria and
archaea, 114 for all bacteria, and much more for some of the individual phyla
of bacteria. This new list of PhyEco markers should allow much more detailed
automated phylogenetic and phylogenetic ecology analyses of these groups than
possible previously.

excitations with very high efficiency. Green sulfur bacteria are considered to
be amongst the most efficient light-harvesting organisms. Despite multiple
experimental and theoretical studies of these bacteria the physical origin of
the efficient and robust energy transfer in their light-harvesting complexes is
not well understood. To study excitation dynamics at the systems level we
introduce an atomistic model that mimics a complete light-harvesting apparatus
of green sulfur bacteria. The model contains approximately 4000 pigment
molecules and comprises a double wall roll for the chlorosome, a baseplate and
six Fenna-Matthews-Olson trimer complexes. We show that the fast relaxation
within functional subunits combined with the transfer between collective
excited states of pigments can result in robust energy funneling. Energy
transfer is robust on the initial excitation conditions and temperature
changes. Moreover, the same mechanism describes the coexistence of multiple
timescales of excitation dynamics frequently observed in ultrafast optical
experiments. While our findings support the hypothesis of supertransfer, the

$T^\beta:=L^{-\beta}$ where $L$ is a symmetric and positive definite unbounded
operator on a Hilbert space $H_0$. The numerical method is based on a
representation formula for $T^{-\beta}$ in terms of Bochner integrals involving

  To develop an approximation to $T^\beta$, we introduce a finite element
approximation $L_h$ to $L$ and base our approximation to $T^\beta$ on
$T_h^\beta:= L_h^{-\beta}$. The direct evaluation of $T_h^{\beta}$ is extremely
expensive as it involves expansion in the basis of eigenfunctions for $L_h$.
The above mentioned representation formula holds for $T_h^{-\beta}$ and we
propose three quadrature approximations denoted generically by $Q_h^\beta$. The
two results of this paper bound the errors in the $H_0$ inner product of
$T^\beta-T_h^\beta\pi_h$ and $T_h^\beta-Q_h^\beta$ where $\pi_h$ is the $H_0$
orthogonal projection into the finite element space. We note that the
evaluation of $Q_h^\beta$ involves application of $(I+(t_i)^2L_h)^{-1}$ with
$t_i$ being either a quadrature point or its inverse. Efficient solution
algorithms for these problems are available and the problems at different
quadrature points can be straightforwardly solved in parallel. Numerical
experiments illustrating the theoretical estimates are provided for both the

proposed directed fractals with a deep trap at a central node. The directed
fractals are a generalization of previous undirected fractals by introducing
the directed edge weights dominated by a parameter. We characterize all the
eigenvalues and their degeneracies for an associated matrix governing the

relation deduced from the self-similar structure of the fractals. We also
obtain the expressions for the smallest eigenvalue and the mean first-passage
time (MFPT) as a measure of trapping efficiency, which is the expected time for
the walker to first visit the trap. The MFPT is evaluated according to the
proved fact that it is approximately equal to reciprocal of the smallest
eigenvalue. We show that the MFPT is controlled by the weight parameter, by
modifying which, the MFPT can scale superlinealy, linearly, or sublinearly with
the system size. Thus, this work paves a way to delicately controlling the

weighted network with a perfect trap fixed at an arbitrary node. By utilizing
the spectral graph theory, we provide an exact formula for mean first-passage
time (MFPT) from one node to another, based on which we deduce an explicit
expression for average trapping time (ATT) in terms of the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix associated with the weighted graph, where
ATT is the average of MFPTs to the trap over all source nodes. We then further
derive a sharp lower bound for the ATT in terms of only the local information
of the trap node, which can be obtained in some graphs. Moreover, we deduce the
ATT when the trap is distributed uniformly in the whole network. Our results
show that network weights play a significant role in the trapping process. To
apply our framework, we use the obtained formulas to study random walks on two
specific networks: trapping in weighted uncorrelated networks with a deep trap,
the weights of which are characterized by a parameter, and L\'evy random walks
in a connected binary network with a trap distributed uniformly, which can be
looked on as random walks on a weighted network. For weighted uncorrelated
networks we show that the ATT to any target node depends on the weight
parameter, that is, the ATT to any node can change drastically by modifying the
parameter, a phenomenon that is in contrast to that for trapping in binary
networks. For L\'evy random walks in any connected network, by using their
equivalence to random walks on a weighted complete network, we obtain the
optimal exponent characterizing L\'evy random walks, which have the minimal
average of ATTs taken over all target nodes.

By varying the driving field on the superconducting resonators, one can readily
access both the adiabatic and anti-adiabatic regimes of this model. Strong e-ph
coupling required for small-polaron formation can also be reached. We show that
small-polaron state of arbitrary quasimomentum can be generated by applying a
microwave pulse to the resonators. We also show that significant squeezing in
the resonator modes can be achieved in the polaron-crossover regime through a

fast time variability which is usually ascribed to instabilities in the
emission region near the central supermassive black hole. The variability time
scale is generally faster in higher energy region, and data recently provided
by the {\it Fermi} Gamma-ray Space Telescope in the GeV energy band enable a
detailed study of the temporal behavior of AGN. Due to its wide field-of-view
in the scanning mode, most sky regions are observed for several hours per day
and daily light curves of many AGN have been accumulated for more than 4 years.
  In this paper we investigate the time variability of 15 well-detected AGNs by
studying the normalized power spectrum density (NPSD) of their light curves in
the GeV energy band. One source, 3C 454.3, shows a specific time scale of
$6.8\times10^5$ s, and this value suggests, assuming the internal shock model,
a mass for the central black hole of $(10^8$--$10^{10})M_\odot$ which is
consistent with other estimates. It also indicates the typical time interval of
ejected blobs is $(7$--$70)$ times the light crossing time of the Schwarzschild
radius.

in the plane has a large subfamily in convex position provided that the number
of common tangents of each pair of bodies is bounded and every subfamily of
size five is in convex position. (If each pair of bodies have at most two
common tangents it is enough to assume that every triple is in convex position,
and likewise, if each pair of bodies have at most four common tangents it is
enough to assume that every quadruple is in convex position.) This confirms a
conjecture of Pach and Toth, and generalizes a theorem of Bisztriczky and Fejes
Toth. Our results on families of convex bodies are consequences of more general
Ramsey-type results about the crossing patterns of systems of graphs of
continuous functions $f:[0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$. On our way towards proving the
Pach-Toth conjecture we obtain a combinatorial characterization of such systems
of graphs in which all subsystems of equal size induce equivalent crossing
patterns. These highly organized structures are what we call regular systems of
paths and they are natural generalizations of the notions of cups and caps from
the famous theorem of Erdos and Szekeres. The characterization of regular

of independent interest.

Across studies of the most commonly used mechanics concept inventories, the
Force Concept Inventory (FCI) and Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation
(FMCE), mens average pretest scores are always higher than womens, and in most
cases mens posttest scores are higher as well. The weighted average gender
difference on these tests is 13% for pretest scores, 12% for posttest scores,
and 6% for normalized gain. This difference is much smaller than the average
difference in normalized gain between traditional lecture and interactive
engagement (25%), but it is large enough that it could impact the results of
studies comparing the effectiveness of different teaching methods. There is
sometimes a gender gap on commonly used electromagnetism concept inventories,
but it is usually much smaller and sometimes is zero or favors women. The
weighted average gender difference on these tests is 3.7% for pretest scores,
8.5% for posttest scores, and 6% for normalized gain. Based on our analysis of
26 published articles, no single factor is sufficient to explain the gap.
Several high-profile studies that have claimed to account for or reduce the
gender gap have failed to be replicated in subsequent studies, suggesting that
isolated claims of explanations of the gender gap should be interpreted with
caution. Other factors, such as gender differences in background preparation,
scores on different kinds of assessment, and splits between how students
respond to test questions when answering for themselves or for a scientist do
contribute to a difference between male and female responses, but the size of
these differences is smaller than the size of the overall gender gap,
suggesting that the gender gap is most likely due to the combination of many
small factors rather than any one factor that can easily be modified.

for the study of a variety of astrophysical and planetlogical problems.
However, it turned out that the standard SPH algorithm has problems in dealing
with hydrodynamical instabilities. This problem is due to the assumption that
the local density distribution is differentiable. In order to solve this
problem, a new SPH formulation, which does not require the differentiability of
the density, have been proposed. This new SPH method improved the treatment of
hydrodynamical instabilities. This method, however, is applicable only to the
equation of state (EOS) of the ideal gas. In this paper, we describe how to
extend the new SPH method to non-ideal EOS. We present the results of various
standard numerical tests for non-ideal EOS. Our new method works well for
non-ideal EOS. We conclude that our new SPH can handle hydrodynamical
instabilities for an arbitrary EOS and that it is an attractive alternative to
the standard SPH.

the matter currently observed at the surface of this star has been processed by

that the pulsar companion is a low mass (~0.2 Msun) remnant star, descending

Since many data transfer are domain specific, for example, downloading of
lecture notes, web-blogs, etc., it is natural to think of data compression in
larger dimensions (i.e. word level rather than character level). Our framework
employs a two-level compression scheme in which the first level identifies
frequent patterns in the text using classical frequent pattern algorithms. The
identified patterns are replaced with special strings and to acheive a better
compression ratio the length of a special string is ensured to be shorter than
the length of the corresponding pattern. After this transformation, on the
resultant text, we employ classical Huffman data compression algorithm. In
short, in the first level compression is done at word level and in the second
level it is at character level. Interestingly, this two level compression
technique for domain specific text outperforms classical Huffman technique. To
support our claim, we have presented both theoretical and simulation results

component, extracted by band pass filtering, is correlated with the variation
of daily solar radio flux during years close to solar minimum. We demonstrate
that the correlation is related to the emergence of regions of solar activity
on the Sun separated, temporally, from the emergence of other active regions.
In this situation, which occurs only near solar minimum, the observed 27 day
variation of temperature can be in phase or out of phase with the 27 day
variation of solar activity. During solar maximum correlation of temperature
and solar activity is much less defined. The amplitude of the 27 day
temperature response to solar activity is large, at times as high as 6 degrees
C, and much larger than the well documented temperature response to the 11 year
cycle of solar activity. We demonstrate that the 27 day temperature response is
localised to the Australian continent and increases towards the centre of the
continent. Several aspects of the 27 day temperature response are consistent
with a 27 day period solar input to the Earth continents generating large scale

star formation in the small progenitors of today's galaxies. This inefficiency
is necessary for reproducing the low stellar-to-virial mass fractions,
suggested by current abundance matching models. A possible driver of this low
efficiency is the radiation pressure exerted by ionizing photons from massive
stars. The effect of radiation pressure in cosmological, zoom-in galaxy
formation simulations is modeled as a non-thermal pressure that acts only in
dense and optically thick star-forming regions. We also include photoionization
and photoheating by massive stars. The full photoionization of hydrogen reduces
the radiative cooling in the $10^{4-4.5}$ K regime. The main effect of
radiation pressure is to regulate and limit the high values of gas density and
the amount of gas available for star formation. This maintains a low star
formation rate of $\sim 1 \ {\rm M_\odot} \ {\rm yr}^{-1}$ in halos with masses
about $10^{11} \ {M_\odot}$ at $z\simeq3$. Infrared trapping and
photoionization/photoheating processes are secondary effects in this mass
range. The galaxies residing in these low-mass halos contain only $\sim0.6\%$
of the total virial mass in stars, roughly consistent with abundance matching.

testing the standard model and hunting for new physics scenarios. In exclusive
decay modes like $B\to K^*(892)l^+l^-$, the S-wave effects may not be
negligible and thus have to be reliably estimated. Using the scalar form
factors derived from dispersion relations in two channels and matched to Chiral
Perturbation Theory, we investigate the S-wave contributions in $\bar B^0\to

mass of $K^*(892)$, and the $B_s\to K^- K^+ l^+l^-$ with $m_{KK}\sim m_{\phi}$.
We find that the S-wave will modify differential decay widths by about 10% in
the process of $\bar B^0\to K^- \pi^+ l^+l^-$ and about 5% in $B_s\to K^- K^+
l^+l^-$. A forward-backward asymmetry for the charged kaon in the final state
arises from the interference between the S-wave and P-wave contributions. The
measurement of this asymmetry offers a new way to determine the variation of
the $K\pi$ S-wave phase versus the invariant mass.

massive stars. As such, they should follow the star formation rate (SFR) of
galaxies. We can use them to probe for star-forming galaxies (SFGs) in the
distant universe following this assumption. The relation between the rate of
LGRBs in a given galaxy and its SFR (that we call the LGRB ""bias"") may be
complex, as we have indications that the LGRB hosts are not perfect analogues
to the general population of SFGs. In this work, we try to quantify the
dependence of the LGRB bias on physical parameters of their host galaxy such as
the SFR or the stellar mass. We propose an empirical method based on the
comparison of stellar mass functions (and SFR distributions) of LGRB hosts and
of SFGs in order to find how the bias depends on the stellar mass or the SFR.
By applying this method to a sample of LGRB hosts at redshifts lower than 1.1,
where the properties of SFGs are well established, and where the properties of
LGRB host galaxies can be deduced from observations (for stellar masses larger
than 10**9.25 Msun and SFR larger than 1.8 Msun / yr), we find that the LGRB
bias depends on both the stellar mass and SFR. We find that the bias decreases
with the SFR, i.e. we see no preference for highly SFGs, once taken into
account the larger number of massive stars in galaxies with larger SFR. We do
not find any trend with the specific star formation rate (SSFR) but the
dynamical range in SSFR in our study is narrow. Although through an indirect
method, we relate these trends to a possible decrease of the LGRBs rate / SFR
ratio with the metallicity. The method we propose suggests trends that may be
useful to constrain models of LGRB progenitors, showing a clear decrease of the
LGRB bias with the metallicity. This is promising for the future as the number
of LGRB hosts studied will increase.

VERUM performs close to optimal allocation in terms of revenue for the

VERUM fares better in terms of revenue, spectrum utilisation and percentage of

can be seen to offer incentives to subscribed users encouraging them to use
TVWS spectrum through greater spectrum availability (as measured by percentage
of winning bidders) as well as to the coordinating spectrum manager through

privacy. Once a privacy model has been selected, the goal is to enforce it
while preserving as much data utility as possible. The main objective of this
thesis is to improve the data utility in k-anonymous and differentially private
data releases. k-Anonymity has several drawbacks. On the disclosure limitation
side, there is a lack of protection against attribute disclosure and against
informed intruders. On the data utility side, dealing with a large number of
quasi-identifier attributes is problematic. We propose a relaxation of
k-anonymity that deals with these issues.
  Differential privacy limits disclosure risk through noise addition. The
Laplace distribution is commonly used for the random noise. We show that the
Laplace distribution is not optimal: the same disclosure limitation guarantee
can be attained by adding less noise. Optimal univariate and multivariate
noises are characterized and constructed.
  Common mechanisms to attain differential privacy do not take into account the
users prior knowledge; they implicitly assume zero initial knowledge about the
query response. We propose a mechanism that focuses on limiting the knowledge
gain over the prior knowledge.
  Microaggregation-based k-anonymity and differential privacy can be combined
to produce microdata releases with the strong privacy guarantees of
differential privacy and improved data accuracy.
  The last contribution delves into the relation between t-closeness and
differential privacy. We see that for a specific distance and under some
reasonable assumptions on the intruders knowledge, t-closeness leads to
differential privacy.

segments may contain additional bivalent vertices in one model but not in the
other. In the former case, we record in a generating function the number of
fatgraph boundary cycles containing a fixed number of bivalent vertices while
in the latter, we instead record the number of boundary cycles of each fixed
length. Second order, non-linear, algebraic partial differential equations are
derived which are satisfied by these generating functions in each case giving
efficient enumerative schemes. Moreover, these generating functions provide
multi-parameter families of solutions to the KP hierarchy. For each model,
there is furthermore a non-orientable analog, and each such model likewise has
its own associated differential equation. The enumerative problems we solve are
interpreted in terms of certain polygon gluings. As specific applications, we
discuss models of several interacting RNA molecules. We also study a matrix
integral which computes numbers of chord diagrams in both orientable and
non-orientable cases in the model with bivalent vertices, and the large-N limit
is computed using techniques of free probability.

the arrival and departure train times to a dynamic behavior of demand. The
optimization model results are then used for computing several measures to
characterize the quality of the obtained timetables considering jointly both

influence of train capacity and the validity of Random Incidence Theorem. An
application to the C5 line of Madrid rapid transit system is presented.
Different measures are analyzed in order to improve the insight into the

Additionally, we complement the multi-wavelength coverage of the galaxies
located in the GOODS fields with deep FIR data taken from the GOODS-Herschel
project. We find that sBzK galaxies represent the general population of SF
galaxies at z ~ 2 better than LBGs. For a given stellar mass, LBGs tend to have
bluer optical colours than sBzK and UV-selected galaxies. We find clean PACS
individual detections for a subsample of 48 LBGs, 89 sBzK, and 91 UV-selected
galaxies, that measure their dust emission directly. Their SFR_total = SFR_UV +
SFR_IR cannot be recovered with the dust-correction factors derived with their
continuum slope and the IRX-beta relations for local starbursts. This has
implications, for example, in the definition of the main sequence (MS) at z ~
2. PACS-detected galaxies are located above the z ~ 2 MS and thus their star
formation is probably driven by starburst. This is in agreement with the shape
of their IR SEDs. PACS-detected galaxies with redder UV continuum slope and
higher stellar mass are more attenuated. We find that for a given UV continuum
slope the dustiest galaxies at higher redshifts are more attenuated and that
for a given stellar mass the dustiest galaxies at higher redshifts have
stronger FIR emission. This suggests an evolution of their dust properties.
However, we do not find significant evolution in the relation between dust
attenuation and stellar mass with redshift, at least at z < 2.5. There is a
subpopulation of 17, 26, and 27 LBGs, sBzK, and UV-selected galaxies,
respectively, that are detected in any of the SPIRE bands. We speculate that
SPIRE-detected LBGs are the bridging population between sub-mm galaxies and

the information leakage rate at the eavesdropper. When the encoder has access

rate-distortion-information leakage rate (R.D.I.) region under a Markov chain
assumption and when S.I. at the encoder does not improve the rate-distortion
region as compared to the case when S.I. is absent. When the decoder also has
access to the eavesdroppers S.I., we characterize the R.D.I. region without the
Markov Chain condition. We then consider a related setting where the encoder
and decoder obtain coded S.I. through a rate limited helper, and characterize
the R.D.I. region for several special cases, including special cases under
logarithmic loss distortion and for special cases of the Quadratic Gaussian
setting. Finally, we consider the amplification measures of list or entropy
constraint at the decoder, and show that the R.D.I. regions for the settings
considered in this paper under these amplification measures coincide with
R.D.I. regions under per symbol logarithmic loss distortion constraint at the
decoder.

the scalar product of the lensing deflection angle with the tangential velocity
of the mass components, and it is maximal for clusters colliding in the plane
of the sky with velocities boosted by their mutual gravity. The bullet cluster
is likely to be the best candidate for the first measurement of this effect due
to the large collision velocity and because the lensing deflection and the
cluster fields can be calculated in advance. We derive the deflection field
using multiply-lensed background galaxies detected with the Hubble Space
Telescope. The velocity field is modeled using self-consistent
N-body/hydrodynamical simulations constrained by the observed X-ray and
gravitational lensing features of this system. We predict that the
triply-lensed images of systems ""G"" and ""H"" straddling the critical curve of
the bullet component will show the largest frequency shifts up to ~0.5 km/sec.
This is within the range of the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array

generation high-throughput optical-IR spectrographs. A detection of this effect
measures the tangential motion of the subclusters directly, thereby clarifying
the tension with LCDM, which is inferred from gas motion less directly. This
method may be extended to smaller redshift differences using the Ly-alpha
forest towards QSOs lensed by more typical clusters of galaxies. More
generally, the tangential component of the peculiar velocities of clusters
derived by our method complements the radial component determined by the

cut through superconducting fluxtubes. This mechanism is interesting because
the oscillation modes need to exceed a critical amplitude in order for it to

efficient damping. The upshot of this is that modes are unlikely to ever evolve
far beyond the critical amplitude. We consider the effect of this new

the equilateral power pad arrangement, independent of the underlying power mesh

multiple relay nodes, referred to as cooperative unicast network, is
considered. First, we introduce ""Mixed Noisy Network Coding"" (MNNC) scheme
which generalizes ""Noisy Network Coding"" (NNC) where relays are allowed to
decode-and-forward (DF) messages while all of them (without exception) transmit
noisy descriptions of their observations. These descriptions are exploited at
the destination and the DF relays aim to decode the transmitted messages while
creating full cooperation among the nodes. Moreover, the destination and the DF
relays can independently select the set of descriptions to be decoded or
treated as interference. This concept is further extended to multi-hopping
scenarios, referred to as ""Layered MNNC"" (LMNNC), where DF relays are organized
into disjoint groups representing one hop in the network. For cooperative
unicast additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) networks we show that -provided DF
relays are properly chosen- MNNC improves over all previously established
constant gaps to the cut-set bound. Secondly, we consider the composite
cooperative unicast network where the channel parameters are randomly drawn
before communication starts and remain fixed during the transmission. Each draw
is assumed to be unknown at the source and fully known at the destination but
only partly known at the relays. We introduce through MNNC scheme the concept
of ""Selective Coding Strategy"" (SCS) that enables relays to decide dynamically
whether, in addition to communicate noisy descriptions, is possible to decode

networks that SCS clearly outperforms conventional coding schemes.

a molecular cloud. As the collapse progresses, the centre of the core begins to
heat up as it becomes optically thick. The temperature and density in the
centre eventually reach high enough values where fusion reactions can ignite;
the protostar is born. This sequence of events entail many physical processes,
of which radiative transfer is of paramount importance. Many simulations of
protostellar collapse make use of a grey treatment of radiative transfer
coupled to the hydrodynamics. However, interstellar gas and dust opacities
present large variations as a function of frequency. In this paper, we
follow-up on a previous paper on the collapse and formation of Larson's first
core using multigroup radiation hydrodynamics (Paper I) by extending the
calculations to the second phase of the collapse and the formation of Larson's
second core. We have made the use of a non-ideal gas equation of state as well
as an extensive set of spectral opacities in a spherically symmetric fully
implicit Godunov code to model all the phases of the collapse of a 0.1, 1 and
10 solar mass cloud cores. We find that, for a same central density, there are
only small differences between the grey and multigroup simulations. The first
core accretion shock remains supercritical while the shock at the second core
border is found to be strongly subcritical with all the accreted energy being
transfered to the core. The size of the first core was found to vary somewhat
in the different simulations (more unstable clouds form smaller first cores)
while the size, mass and temperature of the second cores are independent of
initial cloud mass, size and temperature. Our simulations support the idea of a
standard (universal) initial second core size of 0.003 AU and mass 0.0014 solar
masses.

The connection between the two parts
is the notion of ""categorification"" which we shortly explain/recall in the
introduction.
  In the first part of this thesis we extend Bar-Natan's cobordism based
categorification of the Jones polynomial to virtual links. Our topological
complex allows a direct extension of the classical Khovanov complex (h=t=0),
the variant of Lee (h=0,t=1) and other classical link homologies. We show that
our construction allows, over rings of characteristic 2, extensions with no
classical analogon, e.g. Bar-Natan's Z/2Z-link homology can be extended in two
non-equivalent ways.
  Our construction is computable in the sense that one can write a computer
program to perform calculations, e.g. we have written a MATHEMATICA based
program.
  Moreover, we give a classification of all unoriented TQFTs which can be used
to define virtual link homologies from our topological construction.
Furthermore, we prove that our extension is combinatorial and has semi-local
properties. We use the semi-local properties to prove an application, i.e. we
give a discussion of Lee's degeneration of virtual homology.
  In the second part of this thesis (which is based on joint work with Mackaay
and Pan) we use Kuperberg's sl3 webs and Khovanov's sl3 foams to define a new
algebra K_S, which we call the sl3 web algebra. It is the sl3 analogue of
Khovanov's arc algebra H_n.
  We prove that K_S is a graded symmetric Frobenius algebra. Furthermore, we
categorify an instance of q-skew Howe duality, which allows us to prove that
K_S is Morita equivalent to a certain cyclotomic KLR-algebra. This allows us to
determine the split Grothendieck group K_0(K_S), to show that its center is
isomorphic to the cohomology ring of a certain Spaltenstein variety, and to
prove that K_S is a graded cellular algebra.

with a highly enhanced spontaneous emission rate. A single quantum dot is the

is that there is considerable noise in the emission frequency, making it very
difficult to couple the quantum dot to another quantum system. We solve this
problem here with a dynamic feedback technique that locks the quantum dot
emission frequency to a reference. The incoherent scattering (resonance
fluorescence) represents the single photon output whereas the coherent
scattering (Rayleigh scattering) is used for the feedback control. The
fluctuations in emission frequency are reduced to 20 MHz, just ~ 5% of the
quantum dot optical linewidth, even over several hours. By eliminating the
1/f-like noise, the relative fluctuations in resonance fluorescence intensity
are reduced to ~ 10E-5 at low frequency. Under these conditions, the
antibunching dip in the resonance fluorescence is described extremely well by
the two-level atom result. The technique represents a way of removing charge
noise from a quantum device.

model is studied one more time. In the CSL model each particle interacts with a
noise field that induces the collapse of its wave function. As a consequence of
this interaction, when the particle is electrically charged, it radiates. As
discussed in [1], the formula for the emission rate, to first perturbative
order, contains two terms: One is proportional to the Fourier component of the
noise field at the same frequency as that of the emitted photon and one is
proportional to the zero Fourier component of the noise field. As discussed in
previous works, this second term seems unphysical. In [1], it was shown that
the unphysical term disappears when the noises is confined to a bounded region
and the final particle's state is a wave packet. Here we investigate the origin
of the unphysical term and why it vanishes according to the previous
prescription. For this purpose, the electrodynamic part of the equation of
motion is solved exactly while the part due to the noise is treated
perturbatively. We show that the unphysical term is connected to exponentially
decaying function of time which dies out in the large time limit, however,

in the sense that the primary logical concepts are no more formulas and proofs
but cut-elimination interpreted as an interaction between objects called
designs. When the interaction between two designs goes well, such two designs
are said to be orthogonal. A behaviour is a set of designs closed under
bi-orthogonality. Logical formulas are then denoted by behaviours. Finally
proofs are interpreted as designs satisfying particular properties. In that
way, designs are more general than proofs and we may notice in particular that
they are not typed objects. Incarnation is introduced by Girard in Ludics as a
characterization of ""useful"" designs in a behaviour. The incarnation of a
design is defined as its subdesign that is the smallest one in the behaviour
ordered by inclusion. It is useful in particular because being ""incarnated"" is
one of the conditions for a design to denote a proof of a formula. The
computation of incarnation is important also as it gives a minimal denotation
for a formula, and more generally for a behaviour. We give here a constructive
way to capture the incarnation of the behaviour of a set of designs, without
computing the behaviour itself. The method we follow uses an alternative
definition of designs: rather than defining them as sets of chronicles, we
consider them as sets of paths, a concept very close to that of play in game
semantics that allows an easier handling of the interaction: the unfolding of
interaction is a path common to two interacting designs.

the root system is also seen to play a role. This involved a modular

more generally a supernova graph). However in the isomonodromy story, or wild
nonabelian Hodge theory, slightly larger moduli spaces of connections are

Weyl group isomorphisms, rather than just the open parts isomorphic to quiver
varieties. This question will be solved here, by developing a ""multiplicative

symplectic isomorphisms between wild character varieties. This approach also

what happens when one introduces fermions in this physical scenario. Due to the

that unconfined fermions would be localized within the (2+1)-dimensional layer,

made high-speed data transmission impossible up to now. Recent work has shown
that systematic adjustment of pump conditions enables low phase-noise Kerr
combs with singlet spectral lines. Here we demonstrate that Kerr combs are
suited for coherent data transmission with advanced modulation formats that
pose stringent requirements on the spectral purity of the optical source. In a
first experiment, we encode a data stream of 392 Gbit/s on subsequent lines of
a Kerr comb using quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) and 16-state quadrature
amplitude modulation (16QAM). A second experiment shows feedback-stabilization
of a Kerr comb and transmission of a 1.44 Tbit/s data stream over a distance of
up to 300 km. The results demonstrate that Kerr combs can meet the highly
demanding requirements of multi-terabit/s coherent communications and thus
offer a solution towards chip-scale terabit/s transceivers.

to different assumed shell geometries and compositions, of the unseen
postulated rapidly expanding outer shell to the Crab Nebula. The properties of
the shell are constrained by the mass that must lie within it, and by limits to
the intensities of hydrogen recombination lines. In all cases the
photoionization models predict very strong emission from high ionization lines
that will not be emitted by the Crab's filaments, alleviating problems with
detecting these lines in the presence of light scattered from brighter parts of
the Crab. The NIR [Ne VI] $\lambda$7.652 $\mu$m line is a particularly good
case; it should be dramatically brighter than the optical lines commonly used
in searches. The C IV $\lambda1549\AA$ doublet is predicted to be the strongest
absorption line from the shell, which is in agreement with HST observations. We
show that the cooling timescale for the outer shell is much longer than the age
of the Crab, due to the low density. This means that the temperature of the
shell will actually ""remember"" its initial conditions. However, the
recombination time is much shorter than the age of the Crab, so the predicted
level of ionization should approximate the real ionization. In any case, it is
clear that IR observations present the best opportunity to detect the outer
shell and so guide future models that will constrain early events in the
original explosion.

in the range -200 and -500 km/s, peaked around the southern AGN, at the same
position where the H2 outflow is located, and with a mass loss rate of ~500
Msun/yr. We interpret this blueshifted component as a outflow, originating from
the southern nucleus. The spatial and spectral match strongly suggests that the
CO outflow is connected to the H2 superwind located around the southern
nucleus, and to the large scale CO outflow, with similar velocities, extended
on scales of 10 kpc. The large mass loading factor (dM/dt /SFR ~ 10) of the

the radiation of the southern AGN. We discovered a nuclear, redshifted CO
emission peaking in the mid point of the two nuclei, as it is the case for the
CO emission at the systemic velocity. The large velocity dispersion, which
reaches its maximum (~500 Km/s) in the mid point between the two nuclei,

assumed scalar inputs at the nodes [3, 7]. Recent work has yielded approximate
Byzantine consensus algorithms for the case when the input at each node is a
d-dimensional vector, and the nodes must reach consensus on a vector in the
convex hull of the input vectors at the fault-free nodes [8, 12]. The
d-dimensional vectors can be equivalently viewed as points in the d-dimensional
Euclidean space. Thus, the algorithms in [8, 12] require the fault-free nodes
to decide on a point in the d-dimensional space.
  In this paper, we generalize the problem to allow the decision to be a convex
polytope in the d-dimensional space, such that the decided polytope is within
the convex hull of the input vectors at the fault-free nodes. We name this
problem as Byzantine convex consensus (BCC), and present an asynchronous
approximate BCC algorithm with optimal fault tolerance. Ideally, the goal here
is to agree on a convex polytope that is as large as possible. While we do not
claim that our algorithm satisfies this goal, we show a bound on the output
convex polytope chosen by our algorithm.

superfluid 4He confined in 47 \AA MCM-41 at T = 0.5 K at wave vectors, Q,
beyond the roton wave vector (Q_R =1.92 \AA$^{-1}$). Measurements beyond the
roton require access to high wave vectors (up to Q = 4 \AA$^{-1}$) with
excellent energy resolution and high statistical precision. The present results
show for the first time that at T = 0.5 K the P-R mode in MCM-41 extends out to
wave-vector Q$\simeq$3.6 \AA$^-1$ with the same energy and zero width (within
precision) as observed in bulk superfluid 4He. Layer modes in the roton region
are also observed. Specifically, the P-R mode energy, $\omega_Q$, increases
with Q for Q > QR and reaches a plateau at a maximum energy Q = 2{\Delta} where
{\Delta} is the roton energy, {\Delta} = 0.74 $\pm$ 0.01 meV in MCM-41. This
upper limit means the P-R mode decays to two rotons when its energy exceeds
2{\Delta}. It also means that the P-R mode does not decay to two layers modes.
If the P-R could decay to two layer modes, $\omega_Q$ would plateau at a lower
energy, $\omega_Q$ = 2{\Delta}L where {\Delta}L = 0.60 meV is the energy of the
roton like minimum of the layer mode. The observation of the P-R mode with
energy up to 2{\Delta} shows that the P-R mode and the layer modes are
independent modes with apparently little interaction between them.

Lagrangian map. There are different classes of invariants that are advected or
Lie dragged with the flow. Simple examples are the advection of the entropy S
(a 0-form), and the conservation of magnetic flux (an invariant 2-form advected
with the flow). The magnetic flux conservation law is equivalent to Faraday's
equation. We discuss the gauge condition required for the magnetic helicity to
be advected with the flow. The conditions for the cross helicity to be an
invariant are discussed. We discuss the different variants of helicity in fluid
dynamics and in MHD, including: fluid helicity, cross helicity and magnetic
helicity. The fluid helicity conservation law and the cross helcity
conservation law in MHD are derived for the case of a barotropic gas. If the
magnetic field lies in the constant entropy surface, then the gas pressure can
depend on both the entropy and the density. In these cases the conservation
laws are local conservation laws. We obtain nonlocal conservation laws for
fluid helicity and cross helicity for non-barotropic fluids using the Clebsch
variable formulation of gas dynamics and MHD. Ertel's theorem and potential
vorticity, the Hollman invariant, and the Godbillon Vey invariant for special

by exterior radiation results in anomalous scattering behavior, including sharp
energy-transmission anomalies and field amplification around the frequency of
the slab mode. In the case of a periodically layered ambient medium, anisotropy
serves to couple the slab mode to radiation. Exact expressions for scattering
phenomena are proved by analyzing a pole of the full scattering matrix as it
moves off the real frequency axis into the lower half complex plane under a
detuning of the wavevector parallel to the slab. The real pole is the frequency
of a perfect (infinite Q) guided mode, which becomes lossy as the frequency
gains an imaginary part. This work extends results of Shipman and Venakides to
evanescent source fields and two-dimensional parallel wavevector and
demonstrates by example how the latter allows one to control independently the
width and central frequency of a resonance by varying the angle of incidence of
the source field. The analysis relies on two nondegeneracy conditions of the
complex dispersion relation for slab modes (relating poles of the scattering
matrix to wavevector), which were assumed in previous works and are proved in
this work for layered media. One of them asserts that the dispersion relation
near the wavevector and frequency of a perfect guided mode is the zero set of a
simple eigenvalue, and the other relates the frequency derivative of the
eigenvalue to the total energy of the mode, thereby implying that this
derivative is nonzero.

network. When the input vectors are binary vectors, these gates correspond to
Boolean functions and can be analyzed via their polynomial representations. In
practical applications, it is desirable to find a polynomial representation
with the smallest number of terms possible, in order to use the least possible
number of input lines to the unit under consideration. For this purpose,
instead of an exact polynomial representation, usually the sign representation
of a Boolean function is considered. The non-uniqueness of the sign
representation allows the possibility for using a smaller number of monomials
by solving a minimization problem. This minimization problem is combinatorial
in nature, and so far the best known deterministic algorithm claims the use of
at most $0.75\times 2^n$ of the $2^n$ total possible monomials. In this paper,
the basic methods of representing a Boolean function by polynomials are
examined, and an alternative approach to this problem is proposed. It is shown
that it is possible to use at most $0.5\times 2^n = 2^{n-1}$ monomials based on
the $\{0, 1\}$ binary inputs by introducing extra variables, and at the same
time keeping the degree upper bound at $n$. An algorithm for further reduction
of the number of terms that used in a polynomial representation is provided.
Examples show that in certain applications, the improvement achieved by the
proposed method over the existing methods is significant.

objective is to compute sufficiently and accurately the position and the period

and period) we deploy in each resonance case semi-numerical methods. The
comparison of our semi-numerical results with those obtained by the numerical
integration of the equations of motion indicates that, in every case the
relative error is always less than 1% and therefore, the agreement is more than
sufficient. Thus, we claim that semi-numerical methods are very effective tools
for computing periodic orbits. We also study in detail, the case when the
energy of the orbits is larger than the escape energy. In this case, the
periodic orbits in almost all resonance families become unstable and eventually
escape from the system. Our target is to calculate the escape period and the
escape position of the periodic orbits and also monitor their evolution with
respect to the value of the energy.

energy in the superconducting phase are pointed out. The magnetic interaction
term derived by Darwin is the same as the, so called, Breit term in
relativistic quantum mechanics. While this term always is a small perturbation
in few body systems it can be shown to be potentially dominating in systems of
large numbers of electrons. It is therefore a natural candidate in the
explanation of emergent phenomena---phenomena that only occur in sufficiently
large systems. The dimensionless parameter that indicates the importance of the
magnetic energy is the number of electrons times the classical electron radius
divided by the size of the system. The number of electrons involved are only
the electrons at the Fermi surface; electrons with lower energy cannot
contribute to current density and thus not to the magnetic field.
  The conventional understanding of superconductivity has always been
problematic and no really reductionistic derivation exists. The idea that the
inductive inertia, due to magnetism, is important in the explanation of
superconductivity was first advanced by Frenkel and later brought up by Welker
before it was prematurely discarded. So were theories involving Wigner
crystallization. We speculate that the answer requires the combination of a
Wigner lattice and the Darwin interaction. We point out that the Darwin
interaction can be shown to have the right order of magnitude to explain the
energy scales involved in normal superconductors. The London magnetic moment of
rotating superconductors and the Meissner effect and their connection are
discussed next. The London moment is shown to indicate that the number of
electrons involved in the superconducting condensate is such that the Darwin
interaction cannot be neglected.

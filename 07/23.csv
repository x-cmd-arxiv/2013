two $\Lambda(1405)$ poles from experimental photoproduction data on the $\gamma
p \to K^+ \pi^0 \Sigma^0 $ reaction at Jefferson Lab. Following a similar
strategy, we extend the previous method to incorporate also the isospin 1
component which allows us to consider in addition the experimental data on
$\gamma p \to K^+ \pi^\pm \Sigma^\mp$. The idea is based on considering a
production mechanism as model independent as possible and implementing the
final state interaction of the final meson-baryon pair based on small
modifications of the unitary chiral perturbation theory amplitudes. Good fits
to the data are obtained with this procedure, by means of which we can also
predict the cross sections for the $K^- p \to \bar K N$, $\pi \Sigma$,
$\pi\Lambda$ reactions for the different charge channels. Besides the two poles
found for the $\Lambda(1405)$ resonance, we discuss the possible existence of
an isospin 1 resonance in the vicinity of the $\bar K N$ threshold.

measurements can not only probe directly for specific mechanisms that enhance
our fundamental understanding of nonperturbative QCD but, because transverse
spin asymmetries are unambiguously perameterized by a spin-directed momentum
shift, such measurements can also be used to calibrate other phenomenological
applications of transverse momentum dependent distributions (TMD's) and of TMD

extending the applicability of TDDFT to systems with open boundaries, we
achieve accurate atomistic simulations of real-time electronic response to

exemplified: the relaxation of an excess electron on graphene surface, and the
electron transfer across the molecule-graphene interface. Both the transient

fundamental importance and unique usefulness of an open-system TDDFT approach.

Galaxies (LIRGs) in terms of the host halos that they inhabit, and in
comparison to a control galaxy sample. The LIRGs are drawn from the IRAS Point
Source Catalogue redshift survey (PSCz), while the control sample is drawn from
the 2MASS redshift survey (2MRS). A friends-of-friends algorithm was run on the
2MRS sample to identify galaxies living in the same dark matter halos and the
PSCz galaxies were then associated with these identified halos. We show that
the relative probability of finding local LIRGs with respect to 2MASS galaxies
is largest in approximately group size halos (Mhalo~10^13M_sun), and declines
both in the cluster regime and in smaller halos. This confirms, using a
different technique than in previous work, that local LIRGs are indeed more
abundant in group environments than elsewhere. We also find a trend between the
LIR values of LIRGs and their location within their host dark matter halos,
such that the average location of LIRGs with high IR luminosity is closer to
the halo centre than for low IR luminosity galaxies. Moreover, this trend does
not seem to depend on halo mass.

Applying the action principle for the action (27) we develop a partial (in the

in the initially reduced phase space (with the canonical coordinates
$q_{i},p_{i}$, where the number $n_{p}$ of momenta $p_{i}$, $i=1,\...,n_{p}$
(17) is arbitrary $n_{p}\leq n$, where $n$ is the dimension of the
configuration space), in terms of the partial Hamiltonian $H_{0}$ (18) and
$(n-n_{p})$ additional Hamiltonians $H_{\alpha}$, $\alpha=n_{p}+1,\...,n$ (20).
We obtain $(n-n_{p}+1)$ Hamilton-Jacobi equations (25)-(26). The equations of
motion are first order differential equations (33)-(34) with respect to
$q_{i},p_{i}$ and second order differential equations (35) for $q_{\alpha}$. If
$H_{0}$, $H_{\alpha}$ do not depend on $\dot{q}_{\alpha}$ (42), then the second
order differential equations (35) become algebraic equations (43) with respect
to $\dot{q}_{\alpha}$. We interpret $q_{\alpha}$ as additional times by (45),
and arrive at a multi-time dynamics. The above independence is satisfied in
singular theories and $r_{W}\leq n_{p}$ (58), where $r_{W}$ is the Hessian
rank. If $n_{p}=r_{W}$, then there are no constraints. A classification of the
singular theories is given by analyzing system (62) in terms of
$F_{\alpha\beta}$ (63). If its rank is full, then we can solve the system (62);
if not, some of $\dot{q}_{\alpha}$ remain arbitrary (sign of a gauge theory).
We define new antisymmetric brackets (69) and (80) and present the equations of
motion in the Hamilton-like form, (67)-(68) and (81)-(82) respectively. The
origin of the Dirac constraints in our framework is shown: if we define extra
momenta $p_{\alpha}$ by (86), then we obtain the standard primary constraints
(87), and the new brackets transform to the Dirac bracket. Quantization is
discussed.

the ESA MarcoPolo-R mission, selected for the study phase of ESA M3 missions.
It is a primitive (C-type) asteroid that shows significant variation in its
visible and near-infrared spectra. Here we present new spectra of 1996 FG3 and
we compare our new data with other published spectra, analysing the variation
in the spectral slope. The asteroid will not be observable again over the next
three years at least. We obtained the spectra using DOLORES and NICS
instruments at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG), a 3.6m telescope located
at El Roque de los Muchachos Observatory in La Palma, Spain. To compare with
other published spectra of the asteroid, we computed the spectral slope S', and
studied any plausible correlation of this quantity with the phase angle
(alpha). In the case of visible spectra, we find a variation in spectral slope
of Delta S' = 0.15 +- 0.10 %/10^3 A/degree for 3 < alpha < 18 degrees, in good
agreement with the values found in the literature for the phase reddening
effect. In the case of the near-infrared, we find a variation in the slope of
Delta S' = 0.04 +- 0.08 %/10^3 A/degree for 6 < alpha < 51 degrees. Our
computed variation in S' agrees with the only two values found in the
literature for the phase reddening in the near-infrared. The variation in the
spectral slope of asteroid 1996 FG3 shows a trend with the phase angle at the
time of the observations, both in the visible and the near-infrared. It is
worth noting that, to fully explain this spectral variability we should take
into account other factors, like the position of the secondary component of the
binary asteroid 1999 FG3 with respect to the primary, or the spin axis
orientation at the time of the observations. More data are necessary for an
analysis of this kind.

variety, in that satisfying some separability criterion, such as positivity of

Certifying separability amounts to proving the existence of a decomposition of
a target mixed state into some convex combination of separable states;
determining the existence of such a decomposition is ""hard."" We show that it is
effective to ask, instead, if the target mixed state ""fits"" some preconstructed
separable form, in that one can generate a sufficient separability criterion
relevant to all target states in some family by ensuring enough degrees of
freedom in the preconstructed separable form. We demonstrate this technique by
inducing a sufficient criterion for ""diagonally symmetric"" states of N qubits.
A sufficient separability criterion opens the door to study precisely how
entanglement is (not) formed; we use ours to prove that, counterintuitively,
entanglement is not generated in idealized Dicke model superradiance despite
its exemplification of many-body effects. We introduce a quantification of the
extent to which a given preconstructed parametrization comprises the set of all
separable states; for ""diagonally symmetric"" states our preconstruction is
shown to be fully complete. This implies that our criterion is necessary in

the Coulomb branch BPS spectrum of N=4 super Yang--Mills theories in four

superstring theory in some respects are the ADE (2,0) six-dimensional theories

utilizing the duality between type IIB superstring theory compactified on a

or shape optimization problems, in which the free variable is a shape, such as
a curve in 2d or a surface in 3d. Examples are image segmentation, multiview
stereo reconstruction, geometric interpolation from data point clouds. To
obtain the solution of such a problem, one usually resorts to an iterative
approach, a gradient descent algorithm, which updates a candidate shape
gradually deforming it into the optimal shape. Computing the gradient descent
updates requires the knowledge of the first variation of the shape energy, or
rather the first shape derivative. In addition to the first shape derivative,
one can also utilize the second shape derivative and develop a Newton-type
method with faster convergence. Unfortunately, the knowledge of shape
derivatives for shape energies in image processing is patchy. The second shape
derivatives are known for only two of the energies in the image processing
literature and many results for the first shape derivative are limiting, in the
sense that they are either for curves on planes, or developed for a specific
representation of the shape or for a very specific functional form in the shape
energy. In this work, these limitations are overcome and the first and second
shape derivatives are computed for large classes of shape energies that are
representative of the energies found in image processing. Many of the formulas
we obtain are new and some generalize previous existing results. These results
are valid for general surfaces in any number of dimensions. This work is
intended to serve as a cookbook for researchers who deal with shape energies
for various applications in image processing and need to develop algorithms to
compute the shapes minimizing these energies.

variety of statistical and fault-system models have been discussed for use in
computing forecast probabilities. Our paper takes a new approach. The idea is
based on the observation that GR statistics characterize seismicity for all
space and time. Small magnitude event counts (quake counts) are used as markers
for the approach of large events. More specifically, if the GR b-value = 1,
then for every 1000 M>3 earthquakes, one expects 1 M>6 earthquake. So if ~1000
M>3 events have occurred in a spatial region since the last M>6 earthquake,
another M>6 earthquake should be expected soon. In physics, event count models
have been called natural time models, since counts of small events represent a
physical or natural time scale characterizing the system dynamics. In a
previous paper, we used conditional Weibull statistics to convert event counts
into a temporal probability for a given fixed region. In the present paper, we
dispense with a fixed region, and develop a method to compute these Natural
Time Weibull (NTW) forecasts on a global scale, using an internally consistent
method, in regions of arbitrary shape and size. Among the results we find that
the Japan region is at serious risk for a major (M>8) earthquake over the next

suffices to take the harmonic oscillator as prototype of a bound system. More
precisely, we show that a study of the quantum dynamics of a nonrelativistic

(and one probable high-amplitude delta Scuti star) located in the field-of-view
of the Kepler space telescope. Thirty-seven of the RR Lyrae stars are
fundamental-mode pulsators (i.e., RRab stars) of which 16 exhibit the Blazhko
effect. Four of the stars are multiperiodic RRc pulsators oscillating primarily
in the first-overtone mode. Spectroscopic [Fe/H] values for the 34 stars for
which we were able to derive estimates range from -2.54 +/- 0.13 (NR Lyr) to
-0.05 +/- 0.13 dex (V784 Cyg), and for the 19 Kepler-field non-Blazhko stars
studied by Nemec et al.(2011) the abundances agree will with their photometric
[Fe/H] values. Four non-Blazhko RR Lyrae stars that they identified as
metal-rich (KIC 6100702, V2470 Cyg, V782 Cyg and V784 Cyg) are confirmed as
such, and four additional stars (V839 Cyg, KIC 5520878, KIC 8832417, KIC
3868420) are also shown here to be metal-rich. Five of the non-Blazhko RRab
stars are found to be more metal-rich than [Fe/H] -0.9 dex while all of the 16
Blazhko stars are more metal-poor than this value. New period-phi31s-[Fe/H]
relationships are derived based on ~970 days of quasi-continuous high-precison
Q0-Q11 long- and short-cadence Kepler photometry. With the exception of some
Blazhko stars, the spectroscopic and photometric [Fe/H] values are in good
agreement. Several stars with unique photometric characteristics are
identified, including a Blazhko variable with the smallest known amplitude and
frequency modulations (V838 Cyg).

  Images",,,,,"math.NA math.OC q-bio.BM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A major challenge in single particle reconstruction methods using
cryo-electron microscopy is to attain a resolution sufficient to interpret fine
details in three-dimensional (3D) macromolecular structures. Obtaining high
resolution 3D reconstructions is difficult due to unknown orientations and
positions of the imaged particles, possible incomplete coverage of the viewing
directions, high level of noise in the projection images, and limiting effects
of the contrast transfer function of the electron microscope. In this paper, we
focus on the 3D reconstruction problem from projection images assuming an
existing estimate for their orientations and positions. We propose a fast and
accurate Fourier-based Iterative Reconstruction Method (FIRM) that exploits the
Toeplitz structure of the operator ${\bf A}^{*}{\bf A}$, where $\bf A$ is the
forward projector and ${\bf A}^{*}$ is the back projector. The operator ${\bf
A}^{*}{\bf A}$ is equivalent to a convolution with a kernel. The kernel is
pre-computed using the non-uniform Fast Fourier Transform and is efficiently
applied in each iteration step. The iterations by FIRM are therefore
considerably faster than those of traditional iterative algebraic approaches,
while maintaining the same accuracy even when the viewing directions are
unevenly distributed. The time complexity of FIRM is comparable to the direct
Fourier inversion method. Moreover, FIRM combines images from different defocus
groups simultaneously and can handle a wide range of regularization terms. We
provide experimental results on simulated data that demonstrate the speed and
accuracy of FIRM in comparison with current methods.

or not they are geometric spanners. In this paper we close this gap by showing
that for odd $k \geq 5$, the spanning ratio of $Y_k$ is at most
$1/(1-2\sin(3\theta/8))$, which gives the first constant upper bound for $Y_5$,
and is an improvement over the previous bound of $1/(1-2\sin(\theta/2))$ for
odd $k \geq 7$. We further reduce the upper bound on the spanning ratio for
$Y_5$ from $10.9$ to $2+\sqrt{3} \approx 3.74$, which falls slightly below the
lower bound of $3.79$ established for the spanning ratio of $\Theta_5$
($\Theta$-graphs differ from Yao graphs only in the way they select the closest
neighbor in each cone). This is the first such separation between a Yao and
$\Theta$-graph with the same number of cones. We also give a lower bound of
$2.87$ on the spanning ratio of $Y_5$. Finally, we revisit the $Y_6$ graph,
which plays a particularly important role as the transition between the graphs
($k > 6$) for which simple inductive proofs are known, and the graphs ($k \le
6$) whose best spanning ratios have been established by complex arguments. Here
we reduce the known spanning ratio of $Y_6$ from $17.6$ to $5.8$, getting
closer to the spanning ratio of 2 established for $\Theta_6$.

by combining E-mode polarization measured by SPTpol with estimates of the
lensing potential from a Herschel-SPIRE map of the cosmic infrared background.
We compare this template to the B modes measured directly by SPTpol, finding a
non-zero correlation at 7.7 sigma significance. The correlation has an
amplitude and scale-dependence consistent with theoretical expectations, is
robust with respect to analysis choices, and constitutes the first measurement
of a powerful cosmological observable.

A number of statistical methods have been employed in the literature for
testing the presence of INOV in the light curves, sometimes leading to
discordant results. In this paper we compare the INOV characteristics of six
prominent classes of AGN, as evaluated using three commonly used statistical
tests, namely the $\chi^2-$test, the modified $C-$test and the $F-$test, which
has recently begun to gain popularity. The AGN classes considered are:
radio-quiet quasars (RQQs), radio-intermediate quasars (RIQs), lobe-dominated
quasars (LDQs), low optical polarization core-dominated quasars (LPCDQs), high
optical polarization core-dominated quasars (HPCDQs), and TeV blazars. Our
analysis is based on a large body of AGN monitoring data, involving 262
sessions of intra-night monitoring of a total 77 AGN, using 1-2 metre class
optical telescopes located in India. In order to compare the usefulness of the
statistical tests, we have also subjected them to a `sanity check' by comparing
the number of false positives yielded by each test with the corresponding
statistical prediction. The present analysis is intended to serve as a
benchmark for future INOV studies of AGN of different classes.

detect 39 X-ray flares from Sgr A*, lasting from a few hundred seconds to
approximately 8 ks, and ranging in 2-10 keV luminosity from ~1e34 erg/s to 2e35
erg/s. Despite tentative evidence for a gap in the distribution of flare peak
count rates, there is no evidence for X-ray color differences between faint and
bright flares. Our preliminary X-ray flare luminosity distribution dN/dL is
consistent with a power law with index -1.9 (+0.3 -0.4); this is similar to
some estimates of Sgr A*'s NIR flux distribution. The observed flares
contribute one-third of the total X-ray output of Sgr A* during the campaign,

undetected flares, which may also contribute high-frequency variability. We

has the most entropy and is thus thermodynamically stable. However, we find the
surprising result that for a subset of configurations, even though a single

disproves classical intuition that everything would just fall into the black

significant impact on the rest-frame optical fluxes of z~5-7 galaxies observed
with Spitzer. This line emission makes z~5-7 galaxies appear more massive, with
lower specific star formation rates. However, corrections for this line
emission have been very difficult to perform reliably due to huge uncertainties
on the overall strength of such emission at z>~5.5. Here, we present the most
direct observational evidence yet for ubiquitous high-EW [OIII]+Hbeta line
emission in Lyman-break galaxies at z~7, while also presenting a strategy for
an improved measurement of the sSFR at z~7. We accomplish this through the
selection of bright galaxies in the narrow redshift window z~6.6-7.0 where the
IRAC 4.5 micron flux provides a clean measurement of the stellar continuum
light. Observed 4.5 micron fluxes in this window contrast with the 3.6 micron
fluxes which are contaminated by the prominent [OIII]+Hbeta lines. To ensure a
high S/N for our IRAC flux measurements, we consider only the brightest
(H_{160}<26 mag) magnified galaxies we have identified in CLASH and other
programs targeting galaxy clusters. Remarkably, the mean rest-frame optical
color for our bright seven-source sample is very blue, [3.6]-[4.5]=-0.9+/-0.3.
Such blue colors cannot be explained by the stellar continuum light and require
that the rest-frame EW of [OIII]+Hbeta be greater than 637 Angstroms for the
average source. The bluest four sources from our seven-source sample require an
even more extreme EW of 1582 Angstroms. Our derived lower limit for the mean
[OIII]+Hbeta EW could underestimate the true EW by ~2x based on a simple
modeling of the redshift distribution of our sources. We can also set a robust
lower limit of >~4 Gyr^-1 on the specific star formation rates based on the
mean SED for our seven-source sample. (abridged)

circumstellar disks by opening annular gaps in the gas and dust spatial
distribution. For more than a decade it has been debated whether this is the
dominant process that leads to the formation of transitional disks. In this
paper, we present millimeter-wave interferometric observations of the
transitional disk around the young intermediate mass star LkHa330. These
observations reveal a lopsided ring in the 1.3 mm dust thermal emission
characterized by a radius of about 100 AU and an azimuthal intensity variation
of a factor of 2. By comparing the observations with a Gaussian parametric
model, we find that the observed asymmetry is consistent with a circular arc,
that extends azimuthally by about 90 deg and emits about 1/3 of the total
continuum flux at 1.3 mm. Hydrodynamic simulations show that this structure is
similar to the azimuthal asymmetries in the disk surface density that might be
produced by the dynamical interaction with unseen low mass companions orbiting
within 70 AU from the central star. We argue that such asymmetries might lead
to azimuthal variations in the millimeter-wave dust opacity and in the dust
temperature, which will also affect the millimeter-wave continuum emission.
Alternative explanations for the observed asymmetry that do not require the
presence of companions cannot be ruled out with the existing data. Further
observations of both the dust and molecular gas emission are required to derive
firm conclusions on the origin of the asymmetry observed in the LkHa330 disk.

incomplete beyond several AU. At larger star-planet separations, direct planet
detection through high-contrast imaging has proven successful, but this
technique is sensitive only to young planets and characterization relies upon
theoretical evolution models. Here we demonstrate that radial velocity
measurements and high-contrast imaging can be combined to overcome these
issues. The presence of widely separated companions can be deduced by
identifying an acceleration (long-term trend) in the radial velocity of a star.
By obtaining high spatial resolution follow-up imaging observations, we rule
out scenarios in which such accelerations are caused by stellar binary
companions with high statistical confidence. We report results from an analysis
of Doppler measurements of a sample of 111 M-dwarf stars with a median of 29
radial velocity observations over a median time baseline of 11.8 yr. By
targeting stars that exhibit a radial velocity acceleration (""trend"") with
adaptive optics imaging, we determine that 6.5% +/- 3.0% of M-dwarf stars host
one or more massive companions with 1 < m/M_Jupiter < 13 and 0 < a < 20 AU.
These results are lower than analyses of the planet occurrence rate around
higher-mass stars. We find the giant planet occurrence rate is described by a
double power law in stellar mass M and metallicity F = [Fe/H] such that f(M,F)
= 0.039(+0.056,-0.028) M^(0.8(+1.1,-0.9)) 10^((3.8 +/- 1.2)F). Our results are
consistent with gravitational microlensing measurements of the planet
occurrence rate; this study represents the first model-independent comparison

Our results are consistent with an observed shallow slope in the relationship
between NLR size and L_[OIII], which has been interpreted to indicate that NLR
size is limited by the density and ionization state of the NLR gas rather than
the availability of ionizing photons. We also explore how the NLR size scales
with a more direct measure of instantaneous AGN power using mid-IR photometry
from WISE, which probes warm to hot dust near the central black hole and so,
unlike [OIII], does not depend on the properties of the NLR. Using our results
as well as samples from the literature, we obtain a power-law relationship
between NLR size and L_8micron that is significantly steeper than that observed
for NLR size and L_[OIII]. We find that the size of the NLR goes approximately
as L^(1/2)_8micron, as expected from the simple scenario of constant-density
clouds illuminated by a central ionizing source. We further see tentative
evidence for a flattening of the relationship between NLR size and L_8micron at
the high luminosity end, and propose that we are seeing a limiting NLR size of
10 - 20 kpc, beyond which the availability of gas to ionize becomes too low. We
find that L_[OIII] ~ L_8micron^(1.4), consistent with a picture in which the
L_[OIII] is dependent on the volume of the NLR. These results indicate that
high-luminosity quasars have a strong effect in ionizing the available gas in a
galaxy.

scales. We compare the resulting BLASTPol magnetic field map with a similar map
made via optical polarimetry (The optical data were published in 1998 by J.
Rizzo and collaborators.). The two maps partially overlap and are reasonably
consistent with one another. We compare these magnetic field maps to the
orientations of filaments in Lupus I, and we find that the dominant filament in
the cloud is approximately perpendicular to the large-scale field, while
secondary filaments appear to run parallel to the magnetic fields in their
vicinities. This is similar to what is observed in Serpens South via near-IR

feedback by z ~ 9-8 with further BH growth proceeding in short Eddington

QSOs at high redshift preferentially detect objects at their peak luminosity
and therefore miss a substantial population of QSOs powered by similarly
massive BHs but with low accretion rates. To test whether the required host
halo masses are consistent with the observed galaxy environment of z ~ 6 QSOs,
we produce realistic rest-frame UV images of our simulated galaxies. Without
strong stellar feedback, our simulations predict numbers of bright galaxies
larger than observed by a factor ten or more. Supernova-driven galactic winds
reduce the predicted numbers to a level consistent with observations indicating
that stellar feedback was already very efficient at high redshifts. We have
further investigated the effect of thermal AGN feedback on the surrounding gas.
Our adopted AGN feedback prescription drives mostly energy-driven highly
anisotropic outflows with gas speeds of >= 1000 km/s to distances of >= 10 kpc
consistent with observations. The spatially extended thermal X-ray emission
around bright QSOs powered by these outflows can exceed by large factors the

paradox. The main claim is that a single mode of the lathe radiation is
maximally entangled with the mode inside the horizon and simultaneously with
the modes of early Hawking radiation. We argue that this situation never
happens during the evolution of a black hole. Quantum mechanics tells us that
while the black hole exists, unitary evolution maximally entangles a late mode
located just outside the horizon with a combination of early radiation and
black hole states, instead of either of them separately. One of the reasons for
this is that the black hole radiation is not random and strongly depends on the
geometry and charge of the black hole, as detailed numerical calculations of
Hawking evaporation clearly show. As a consequence, one can't factor out the
state of the black hole. However, this extended entanglement between the black
hole and modes of early and late radiation indicates that, as the black hole
ages, the local Rindler horizon is modified out to macroscopic distances from
the black hole. Fundamentally non-local physics nor firewalls are not necessary
to explain this result. We propose an infrared mechanism called {\it icezone}
that is mediated by low energy interacting modes and acts near any event
horizon to entangle states separated by long distances. These interactions at
first provide small corrections to the thermal Hawking radiation. At the end of
evaporation however the effect of interactions is as large as the Hawking
radiation and information is recovered for an outside observer. We verify this
in an explicit construction and calculation of the density matrix of a spin
model.

With the mass-density and velocity-anisotropy profiles we then obtain the first

expectations. Other mass profile models also provide acceptable fits to our

or comparable (Einasto) quality than NFW. The velocity anisotropy profiles of
the passive and star-forming cluster members are similar, close to isotropic
near the center and increasingly radial outside. Passive cluster members follow
extremely well the theoretical expectations for the pseudo-phase-space density
profile and the relation between the slope of the mass-density profile and the

Since gravitational modes are oblivious to dissipative dynamics, this
generically lowers the tensor-to-scalar ratio and yields a modified consistency
relation for warm inflation, as well as changing the tilt of the scalar
spectrum. We show that this alters the landscape of observationally allowed
inflationary models, with for example the quartic chaotic potential being in

  5)",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recovering a low-rank tensor from incomplete information is a recurring
problem in signal processing and machine learning. The most popular convex
relaxation of this problem minimizes the sum of the nuclear norms of the
unfoldings of the tensor. We show that this approach can be substantially
suboptimal: reliably recovering a $K$-way tensor of length $n$ and Tucker rank
$r$ from Gaussian measurements requires $\Omega(r n^{K-1})$ observations. In
contrast, a certain (intractable) nonconvex formulation needs only $O(r^K +
nrK)$ observations. We introduce a very simple, new convex relaxation, which
partially bridges this gap. Our new formulation succeeds with $O(r^{\lfloor K/2
\rfloor}n^{\lceil K/2 \rceil})$ observations. While these results pertain to
Gaussian measurements, simulations strongly suggest that the new norm also
outperforms the sum of nuclear norms for tensor completion from a random subset
of entries.
  Our lower bound for the sum-of-nuclear-norms model follows from a new result
on recovering signals with multiple sparse structures (e.g. sparse, low rank),
which perhaps surprisingly demonstrates the significant suboptimality of the
commonly used recovery approach via minimizing the sum of individual sparsity
inducing norms (e.g. $l_1$, nuclear norm). Our new formulation for low-rank
tensor recovery however opens the possibility in reducing the sample complexity
by exploiting several structures jointly.

simple transit shape, and it is generally difficult to differentiate between
anomalies of astrophysical nature (e.g. starspots) and correlated noise due to
instrumental or atmospheric effects. Our solution is to observe transit events
simultaneously with two telescopes located at different observatories. Aims.
Using this observational strategy, we look for anomalies in the light curves of
two transiting planetary systems and accurately estimate their physical
parameters. Methods. We present the first photometric follow-up of the
transiting planet HAT-P-16 b, and new photometric observations of WASP-21 b,
obtained simultaneously with two medium-class telescopes located in different
countries, using the telescope defocussing technique. We modeled these and
other published data in order to estimate the physical parameters of the two
planetary systems. Results. The simultaneous observations did not highlight
particular features in the light curves, which is consistent with the low
activity levels of the two stars. For HAT-P-16, we calculated a new ephemeris
and found that the planet is 1.3 \sigma colder and smaller (Rb = 1.190 \pm
0.037 RJup) than the initial estimates, suggesting the presence of a massive
core. Our physical parameters for this system point towards a younger age than
previously thought. The results obtained for WASP-21 reveal lower values for
the mass and the density of the planet (by 1.0 \sigma and 1.4 \sigma
respectively) with respect to those found in the discovery paper, in agreement
with a subsequent study. We found no evidence of any transit timing variations

usually the later follows the first one. Equations, in question, involve the
multiplication by the positive scalars $c$ or an action of the corresponding

for stopping times (or in general, for the stochastic analysis) to come into
the ""picture"". However, if one accepts the view that the primary objective, in
the classical limit distributions theory, is to describe the limiting
distributions (or random variables) by the tools of random
integrals/functionals then one can use the stopping times. In this paper we
illustrate such a possibility in the case of selfdecomposability random
variables (i.e. L\'evy class L) with values in a real separable Banach space.

point out that there is an initial transient in the position of the microtubule
where it will typically move of order its own length. We compare the physics of
this gliding assay to a recent theory of the role of antagonistic motors on
restricting interpolar microtubule sliding of a cell's mitotic spindle during
prometaphase. It is concluded that randomly positioned antagonistic motors can
restrict relative movement of microtubules, however they do so imperfectly. A
variation in motor concentrations is also analyzed and shown to lead to greater
control of spindle length.

thicknesses and optical properties of thin films on a substrate at cryogenic
temperatures. In the PCSA arrangement of ellipsometry the polarizer and the
compensator are placed before the substrate and the analyzer after it. Usually,
the polarizer and the analyzer are rotated to find the intensity minimum
searched for in null ellipsometry. In our variant we rotate the polarizer and
the compensator instead, both being placed in the incoming beam before the
substrate. Therefore the polarization analysis of the reflected beam can be
realized by an analyzer at fixed orientation. We developed this method for
investigations of thin cryogenic films inside a vacuum chamber, where the
analyzer and detector had to be placed inside the cold shield at a temperature
of T approx. 90K close to the substrate. All other optical components were
installed at the incoming beam line outside the vacuum chamber, including all
components which need to be rotated during the measurements. Our null
ellipsometry variant has been tested with condensed krypton films on a highly
oriented pyrolytic graphite substrate (HOPG) at a temperature of T approx. 25K.
We show that it is possible to determine the indices of refraction of condensed
krypton and of the HOPG substrate as well as thickness of krypton films with
reasonable accuracy.

Hamiltonian including particle-depletant and depletant-depletant interactions

function into multiple Gaussian integrals, regardless of what microscopic

discuss when our formula is a dominant contribution to the effective

generally allowed in AQC. There are two main techniques known to suppress
errors during an AQC implementation: energy gap protection and dynamical
decoupling. Here we show that both these methods are intimately related and can
be analyzed within the same formalism. We analyze the effectiveness of such
error suppression techniques and identify critical constraints on the
performance of error suppression in AQC, suggesting that error suppression by
itself is insufficient for large-scale, fault-tolerant AQC and that a form of
error correction is needed. We discuss progress towards implementing error
correction in AQC and enumerate several key outstanding problems.

analysis on graph data. Over the years, many algorithms have been proposed to

replacement policy. Recursively partitioning a tree into contiguous subtrees
and prescribing an ordering amongst the subtrees, Hierarchical Layouts
generalize many commonly used layouts for trees such as in-order, pre-order and

Hierarchical Layouts thus unify all previous attempts at deriving layouts for

that mimics the probability of cache misses at multiple levels, and shows that
layouts that reduce this measure perform better. We analyze the various degrees

relative effect of each of these decisions in the construction of
cache-oblivious layouts. Optimizing the Weighted Edge Product for complete

downstream evolution of the scale-by-scale energy transfer, dissipation,
advection, production and transport in the lee of a square-mesh grid and
compare with a region of equilibrium turbulence (i.e. where
$C_{\varepsilon}\approx \mathrm{constant}$). These are the main terms of the
inhomogeneous, anisotropic version of the von K\'{a}rm\'{a}n-Howarth-Monin
equation. It is shown in the grid-generated turbulence studied here that, even
in the presence of non-negligible turbulence production and transport,
production and transport are large-scale phenomena that do not contribute to
the scale-by-scale balance for scales smaller than about a third of the
integral-length scale, $\ell$, and therefore do not affect the energy transfer
to the small-scales. In both the non-equilibrium and the equilibrium decay
regions, the peak of the scale-by-scale energy transfer scales as
$(\overline{u^2})^{3/2}/\ell$ ($\overline{u^2}$ is the variance of the
longitudinal fluctuating velocity). In the non-equilibrium case this scaling
implies an imbalance between the energy transfer to the small scales and the
dissipation. This imbalance is reflected on the small-scale advection which
becomes larger in proportion to the maximum energy transfer as the turbulence
decays whereas it stays proportionally constant in the further downstream
equilibrium region where $C_{\varepsilon} \approx \mathrm{constant}$ even

making process is utilized for a non-overlapping sliding windows of P bits

Error Correction Coding (ECC) is adversely effected by the presence of long and

modulation code trellis architectures that are operating on larger state spaces
at the expense of increased implementation complexity, the proposed detector

operates at reduced state trellis. We present pre ECC bit error rate

explained by the double resonance Raman process which is different from the

that, for sufficiently large $n$, the complete bipartite graph
$K_{\delta,n-\delta}$ is the $n$-vertex graph with minimum degree $\delta$ that

  In this paper, we begin the project of generalizing this result to arbitrary

cataclysmic variables (CVs) - rely mainly on our understanding of low-mass star
angular momentum loss (AML) mechanisms. The coupling of stellar wind with its
magnetic field, i.e., magnetic braking, is the most promising mechanism to
drive AML in these stars. There are basically two properties driving magnetic
braking: the stellar magnetic field and the stellar wind. Understanding the
mechanisms that drive AML therefore requires a comprehensive understanding of
these two properties. RRCae is a well-known nearby (d=20pc) eclipsing DA+M
binary with an orbital period of P=7.29h. The system harbors a metal-rich cool
white dwarf (WD) and a highly active M-dwarf locked in synchronous rotation.
The metallicity of the WD suggests that wind accretion is taking place, which
provides a good opportunity to obtain the mass-loss rate of the M-dwarf
component. We analyzed multi-epoch time-resolved high-resolution spectra of
RRCae in search for traces of magnetic activity and accretion. We selected a
number of well-known activity indicators and studied their short and long-term
behavior. Indirect-imaging tomographic techniques were also applied to provide
the surface brightness distribution of the magnetically active M-dwarf, and
reveals a polar feature similar to those observed in fast-rotating solar-type
stars. The blue part of the spectrum was modeled using a atmosphere model to
constrain the WD properties and its metal enrichment. The latter was used to
improve the determination of the mass-accretion rate from the M-dwarf wind. The
presence of metals in the WD spectrum suggests that this component arises from
accretion of the M-dwarf wind. A model fit to the WD gives Teff=(7260+/-250)K
and logg=(7.8+/-0.1) dex with a metallicity of <log[X/Xsun]>=(-2.8+/-0.1)dex,
and a mass-accretion rate of dotMacc=(7+/-2)x1e-16Msun/yr.

dissipation of the solar photon flux into heat through organic pigments in
water. From this thermodynamic perspective, biological evolution is thus just
the dispersal of organic pigments and water throughout Earth's surface, while
adjusting the gases of Earth's atmosphere to allow the most intense part of the
solar spectrum to penetrate the atmosphere and reach the surface to be
intercepted by these pigments. The covalent bonding of atoms in organic
pigments provides excited levels compatible with the energies of these photons.
Internal conversion through vibrational relaxation to the ground state of these
excited molecules when in water leads to rapid dissipation of the solar photons
into heat, and this is the major source of entropy production on Earth. A
non-linear irreversible thermodynamic analysis shows that the proliferation of
organic pigments on Earth is a direct consequence of the pigments catalytic
properties in dissipating the solar photon flux. A small part of the energy of
the photon goes into the production of more organic pigments and supporting
biomass, while most of the energy is dissipated and channeled into the
hydrological cycle through the latent heat of vaporization of surface water. By
dissipating the surface to atmosphere temperature gradient, the hydrological
cycle further increases the entropy production of Earth. This thermodynamic
perspective of solar photon dissipation by life has implications to the
possibility of finding extra-terrestrial life in our solar system and the
Universe.

in cell biology, with a wide range of applications. Brownian ratchets are
fundamental in various biochemical processes, and are roughly divided into two
categories: active (usually ATP-powered) molecular motors and passive
constructions with a directional bias, where the transport is driven by thermal
motion. In this paper we discuss the latter process, of spontaneous
translocation of molecules (Brownian particles) by ratcheted diffusion with no
external energy input: a problem relevant for protein translocation along
bacterial flagella or injectosome complex, or DNA translocation by
bacteriophages. We use molecular dynamics simulations and statistical theory to
identify two regimes of transport: at low rate of particles injection into the
channel the process is controlled by the individual diffusion towards the open
end (the first passage problem), while at a higher rate of injection the
crowded regime sets in. In this regime the particle density in the channel
reaches a constant saturation level and the resistance force increases
substantially, due to the osmotic pressure build-up. To achieve a steady-state
transport, the apparatus that injects new particles into a crowded channel has
to operate with an increasing power consumption, proportional to the length of
the channel and the required rate of transport. The analysis of resistance
force, and accordingly -- the power required to inject the particles into a
crowded channel to oversome its clogging, is also relevant for many
microfluidics applications.

compatibility between phases in martensitic materials. They consist of three
subconditions: i) the condition that the middle principal stretch of the
transformation stretch tensor $\mathbf U$ is unity ($\lambda_2 = 1$), ii) the
condition $\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf U\, \cof (\mathbf U^2 - \mathbf I)\mathbf n
= 0$, where the vectors $\mathbf a$ and $\mathbf n$ are certain vectors arising
in the specification of the twin system, and iii) the inequality ${\rm tr}
\mathbf U^2 + \det \mathbf U^2 -(1/4) |\mathbf a|^2 |\mathbf n|^2\ge 2$.
Together, these conditions are necessary and sufficient for the equations of
the crystallographic theory of martensite to be satisfied for the given twin
system but for any volume fraction f of the twins, $0 \le f \le 1$. This
contrasts sharply with the generic solutions of the crystallographic theory
which have at most two such volume fractions for a given twin system of the
form $f^*$ and $1-f^*$. In this paper we simplify the form of the cofactor
conditions, we give their specific forms for various symmetries and twin types,
we clarify the extent to which the satisfaction of the cofactor conditions for
one twin system implies its satisfaction for other twin systems. In particular,
we prove that the satisfaction of the cofactor conditions for either Type I or
Type II twins implies that there are solutions of the crystallographic theory
using these twins that have no elastic transition layer. We show that the
latter further implies macroscopically curved, transition-layer-free
austenite/martensite interfaces for Type I twins, and planar
transition-layer-free interfaces for Type II twins which nevertheless permit
significant flexibility of the martensite. We identify some real material
systems nearly satisfying the cofactor conditions.

context. The brick wall model suggests that without an appropriate near horizon
IR cut-off, the free energy of the probe fields show the divergence due to the
large degenerate states near the horizons. After studying the universal nature
of the divergence in various holographic setting in various dimensions, we
interpret the nature of the divergence in a holographic context. The free
energy divergence is due to the large degeneracy and continuity of the low
energy spectrum in the boundary theory at the deconfinement phase. These
divergence and continuity should be removed by finite N effects, which make the
spectrum discrete even at the deconfinement phase. On the other hand, in the
bulk, these degenerate states are localized near the horizon, and the universal
divergence of these degenerate states implies that the naive counting of the
degrees of freedom in bulk should be modified once we take into account the
non-perturbative quantum gravity effects near the horizon. Depending on the
microscopic degrees of freedom, the position, where the effective field theory
description to count the states breaks down, has different Planck scale
dependence. It also implies the difficulty to have an electron like
gauge-singlet elementary field in the boundary theory Lagrangian. These singlet
fields are at most composite fields, because they show divergent free energy,
suggesting a positive power of N at the deconfinement phase.

near-optimal performance for this problem when the bids arrive in a random

from the Bekenstein entropy but also from a generalized black-hole entropy
proposed by C. Tsallis and L.J.L. Cirto [Eur. Phys. J. C \textbf{73}, 2487
(2013)]. Unlike the Bekenstein entropy, which is proportional to area, the
generalized entropy is proportional to volume because of appropriate
nonadditive generalizations. The entropic-force term derived from the
generalized entropy is found to behave as if it were an extra driving term for
bulk viscous cosmology, in which a bulk viscosity of cosmological fluids is
assumed. Using an effective description similar to bulk viscous cosmology, we
formulate the modified Friedmann, acceleration, and continuity equations for
entropic cosmology. Based on this formulation, we propose two entropic-force
models derived from the Bekenstein and generalized entropies. In order to
examine the properties of the two models, we consider a homogeneous, isotropic,
and spatially flat universe, focusing on a single-fluid-dominated universe. The
two entropic-force models agree well with the observed supernova data.
Interestingly, the entropic-force model derived from the generalized entropy
predicts a decelerating and accelerating universe, as for a fine-tuned standard
$\Lambda$CDM (lambda cold dark matter) model, whereas the entropic-force model
derived from the Bekenstein entropy predicts a uniformly accelerating universe.

rather than by a simple Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Here we have collected
together the new atomic data within a modified photoionisation code to explore
the effects of both the new atomic data and the $\kappa$-distribution on the
strong-line techniques used to determine chemical abundances in \HII regions.
By comparing the recombination temperatures ($T_{\rm rec}$) with the forbidden
line temperatures ($T_{\rm FL}$) we conclude that $ \kappa \sim 20$. While
representing only a mild deviation from equilibrium, this is sufficient to
strongly influence abundances determined using methods which depend on
measurements of the electron temperature from forbidden lines. We present a
number of new emission line ratio diagnostics which cleanly separate the two
parameters determining the optical spectrum of \HII regions - the ionisation
parameter $q$ or $\cal{U}$ and the chemical abundance; 12+log(O/H). An
automated code to extract these parameters is presented. Using the homogeneous
dataset from \citet{vanZee98}, we find self-consistent results between all
these different diagnostics. The systematic errors between different line ratio
diagnostics are much smaller than was found in the earlier strong line work.
Overall the effect of the $\kappa$-distribution on the strong line abundances
derived solely on the basis of theoretical models is rather small.

pressure that, on top of the main orbital (dx2-y2), a hybridization with the
second (dz2) orbital around the Fermi energy significantly affects Tc in the
spin-fluctuation mediated pairing, where the hybridization is dominated by
material parameters. We can then show that applying pressures along a, b axes
enhances Tc while a c axis pressure suppresses Tc, where not only the dz2
hybridization but also Cu(4s) hybridization exert an effect. For the
multi-layer cuprates, inter-layer pair hopping is suggested to be important,
which may contribute to pressure effect. Pressure effect is also interesting in
a recently discovered aromatic family of superconductors (picene, etc). There,
we have again multi-band systems, which in this case derive from different

pockets/sheets having different dimensionalities arising from anisotropic
transfers between the molecular orbitals, and pressure effects should be an

using the magnetic force theorem and the second-order perturbation theory in
terms of spin-orbit interactions. We systematically describe the mechanism of

magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy in FePt and CoPt arises from the strong

fundamental mode and the period change rate \dot\Pi varies nearly by a factor
of two for both crossings of the instability strip. In the period -- period
change rate diagram the values of the period and \dot\Pi concentrate within the

observed in a purely two-dimensional electron system (2DEG)like graphene, and
their properties are promising for new tunable plasmonic metamaterials in the
terahertz and the mid-infrared frequency range. Dirac quasi-particles are known
to exist also in the two-dimensional electron gas which forms at the surface of
topological insulators due to a strong spin-orbit interaction. Therefore,one
may look for their collective excitations by using infrared spectroscopy. Here
we first report evidence of plasmonic excitations in a topological insulator

lineshape was found to be extremely robust vs. temperature between 6 and 300 K,

changing W and measuring in the terahertz range the plasmonic frequency vP vs.

Nuclei (AGNs) are compared based on our systematic modeling of the observed
spectral energy distributions of a sample of AGNs with a single-zone leptonic
model. We show that the correlation between the jet power (P_{jet}) and the
prompt gamma-ray luminosity (L_{jet}) of GRBs is consistent, within the
uncertainties, with the correlation between jet power and the synchrotron peak
luminosity (L_{s, jet}) of flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). Their radiation
efficiencies (\varepsilon) are also comparable (>10% for most sources), which
increase with the bolometric jet luminosity (L_{bol,jet}) for FSRQs and with
the L_{jet} for GRBs with similar power-law indices. BL Lacs do not follow the
P_{jet}-L_{s, jet} relation of FSRQs. They have lower \varepsilon and L_{bol,
jet} values than FSRQs, and a tentative L_{bol, jet}-\varepsilon relation is
also found, with a power-law index being different from that of the FSRQs. The
magnetization parameters (\sigma) of FSRQs are averagely larger than that of BL
Lacs. They are anti-correlated with $\varepsilon$ for the FSRQs, but positive
correlated with \varepsilon for the BL Lacs. GeV Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies
potentially share similar properties with FSRQs. Based on the analogy between
GRBs and FSRQs, we suggest that the prompt gamma-ray emission of GRBs is likely
produced by synchrotron process in a magnetized jet with high radiation

only neighboring states of its standard basis, and (ii) its matrix elements

monoidal categories aiming by this to provide a common framework of previous
studies in the literature. We make a special emphasis of this action on Azumaya
monoids. To this end, we develop the theory of invertible bimodules over
different monoids (a sort of Morita contexts) in general monoidal categories as
well as their corresponding Miyashita action. Roughly speaking, a Miyashita
action is a homomorphism of groups from the group of all isomorphic classes of
invertible subobjects of a given monoid to its group of automorphisms. In the
symmetric case, we show that for certain Azumaya monoids, which are abundant in
practice, the corresponding Miyashita action is always an isomorphism of
groups. This generalizes Miyashita's classical result and sheds light on other
applications of geometric nature which can not be treated using the classical
theory. In order to illustrate our methods, we give a concrete application to
the category of comodules over commutative (flat) Hopf algebroids. This
obviously includes the special cases of split Hopf algebroids (action
groupoids), which for instance cover the situation of the action of an affine
algebraic group on an affine algebraic variety.

to systems that are similar to observed galaxy clusters, but they also reverse
the global baryonic effects on the clusters. The resulting mass function is
closer to the unmodified dark matter halo mass function but still contains a
mass dependent bias at the 5-10% level. These effects bias measurements of the
cosmological parameters, such as $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_m$. For current cluster
surveys baryonic effects are within the noise for current survey volumes, but
forthcoming and planned large SZ, X-ray and multi-wavelength surveys will be
biased at the percent level by these processes. The predictions for the halo

of normal fibroglandular tissues and abnormal lesions by reconstructing a
pseudo-3D image of the breast. In this respect, DBT overcomes a major
limitation of conventional X-ray mammography by reducing the confounding
effects caused by the superposition of breast tissue. In a breast cancer
screening or diagnostic context, a radiologist is interested in detecting
change, which might be indicative of malignant disease. To help automate this
task image registration is required to establish spatial correspondence between
time points. Typically, images, such as MRI or CT, are first reconstructed and
then registered. This approach can be effective if reconstructing using a
complete set of data. However, for ill-posed, limited-angle problems such as
DBT, estimating the deformation is complicated by the significant artefacts
associated with the reconstruction, leading to severe inaccuracies in the
registration. This paper presents a mathematical framework, which couples the
two tasks and jointly estimates both image intensities and the parameters of a
transformation.
  We evaluate our methods using various computational digital phantoms,
uncompressed breast MR images, and in-vivo DBT simulations. Firstly, we compare
both iterative and simultaneous methods to the conventional, sequential method
using an affine transformation model. We show that jointly estimating image
intensities and parametric transformations gives superior results with respect
to reconstruction fidelity and registration accuracy. Also, we incorporate a
non-rigid B-spline transformation model into our simultaneous method. The
results demonstrate a visually plausible recovery of the deformation with
preservation of the reconstruction fidelity.

investigations of the cluster beam position, size, and intensity. Moreover,
since electrically uncharged clusters remain undetected, the operation in an

the position and size of an accelerator beam crossing an originally

with reverse bends in isochronous separate sector cyclotrons (and/or FFAGs). If
one uses reverse bends between the sectors (instead of drifts) and places
stripper foils at the sector exit edges, the stripped beam has a reduced
bending radius and it should be able to leave the cyclotron within the range of
the reverse bend - even if the beam is stripped at less than full energy.
  We are especially interested in $H_2^+$-cyclotrons, which allow to double the
charge to mass ratio by stripping. However the principle could be applied to
other ions or ionized molecules as well. For the production of proton beams by
stripping extraction of an $H_2^+$-beam, we discuss possible designs for three
types of machines: First a low-energy cyclotron for the simultaneous production
of several beams at multiple energies - for instance 15 MeV, 30 MeV and 70 MeV
- thus allowing to have beam on several isotope production targets. In this
case it is desired to have a strong energy dependence of the direction of the
extracted beam thus allowing to run multiple target stations simultaneously.
Second we consider a fast variable energy proton machine for cancer therapy
that should allow extraction (of the complete beam) at all energies in the
range of about 70 MeV to about 250 MeV into the same beam line. And third, we
consider a high intensity high energy machine, where the main design goals are
extraction with low losses, low activation of components and high reliability.
  The price that has to be paid for these advantages is an increase in size
and/or in field strength compared to proton machines with standard extraction
at the final energy.

X-1 observed by RXTE with the phase of the 35-day cycle. We demonstrate this
using all available measurements of X-ray pulse profiles in the 9-13 keV energy
range obtained with the RXTE/PCA. The measured profiles guided the elaboration
of a geometrical model and the definition of locations of emitting poles, arcs,
and spots on the NS surface which satisfactorily reproduce the observed pulse
profiles and their dependence on free precession phase. We have found that the
observed trend of the times of the 35-day turn-ons on the O-C diagram, which
can be approximated by a collection of consecutive linear segments around the
mean value, can be described by our model by assuming a variable free
precession period, with a fractional period change of about a few percent. We
propose that the 2.5% changes in the free precession period that occur on time
scales of several to tens of 35-day cycles can be related to wandering of the
principal inertia axis of the NS body due to variations in the patterns of
accretion onto the NS surface. The closeness of periods of the disk precession
and the NS free precession can be explained by the presence of a
synchronization mechanism in the system, which modulates the dynamical
interaction of the gas streams and the accretion disk with the NS free
precession period.

eV, the lowest excitations from the t2g into the eg levels at 1.86 eV, and
further excitations above 2.2 eV. For the intra-t2g excitations at 0.1-0.2 eV,
the RIXS peaks show small shifts of the order of 10-40 meV as a function of
temperature and of about 13-20 meV as a function of the transferred momentum
q||a. We argue that the latter reflects a finite dispersion of the orbital
excitations. For incident energies tuned to the oxygen K edge, RIXS is more
sensitive to intersite excitations. We observe excitations across the
Mott-Hubbard gap and find an additional feature at 0.4 eV which we attribute to
two-orbiton scattering, i.e., an exchange of orbitals between adjacent sites.
Altogether, these results indicate that both superexchange interactions and the
coupling to the lattice are important for a quantitative understanding of the

with HIV means that infected people may live a normal, healthy life and offers
the prospect of eliminating HIV transmission in the short term and HIV
infection in the long term. Other interventions, including the use of condoms,
pre-exposure prophylaxis, treatment of sexually transmitted infections and
behaviour change programmes, may also be effective in reducing HIV transmission
to varying degrees.
  Here we examine recommendations for when to start treatment with
anti-retroviral drugs, estimate the impact that treatment may have on HIV
transmission in the short and in the long term, and compare the impact and cost
of treatment with that of other methods of control. We focus on generalized HIV
epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. We show that universal access to ART combined
with early treatment is the most effective and, in the long term, the most
cost-effective intervention. Elimination will require effective coverage of
about 80% or more but treatment is effective and cost effective even at low
levels of coverage.
  Other interventions may provide important support to a programme of early
treatment in particular groups. Condoms provide protection for both men and
women and should be readily available whenever they are needed. Medical male
circumcision will provide a degree of immediate protection for men and
microbicides will do the same for women. Behaviour change programmes in
themselves are unlikely to have a significant impact on overall transmission
but may play a critical role in supporting early treatment through helping to
avoid stigma and discrimination, ensuring the acceptability of testing and
early treatment as well as compliance.

observed in the Earth's secular variation and are thought to influence length
of day variations via angular momentum conservation. In order to investigate
the dynamics of torsional oscillations, we perform several three-dimensional

of the waves are influenced by the choice of parameters. Torsional waves are
observed within the tangent cylinder and also have the ability to pass through

smoothly between 2D HAFs on the square ($x=0$) and triangular ($x=1$) lattices,
and also extrapolates to disconnected 1D HAF chains ($x \to \infty$). The

to utilize computing resources hosted by Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). More
and more consumers rely on CSPs to supply computing and storage service on the
one hand, and CSPs try to attract consumers on favorable terms on the other. In
such competitive cloud computing markets, pricing policies are critical to
market efficiency. While CSPs often publish their prices and charge users
according to the amount of resources they consume, auction mechanism is rarely
applied. In fact a feasible auction mechanism is the most effective method for
allocation of resources, especially double auction is more efficient and
flexible for it enables buyers and sellers to enter bids and offers
simultaneously. In this paper we bring up an electronic auction platform for
cloud, and a cloud Continuous Double Auction (CDA) mechanism is formulated to
match orders and facilitate trading based on the platform. Some evaluating
criteria are defined to analyze the efficiency of markets and strategies.
Furthermore, the selection of bidding strategies for the auction plays a very
important role for each player to maximize its own profit, so we developed a
novel bidding strategy for cloud CDA, BH-strategy, which is a two-stage game
bidding strategy. At last we designed three simulation scenarios to compare the
performance of our strategy with other dominating bidding strategies and proved
that BH-strategy has better performance on surpluses, successful transactions
and market efficiency. In addition, we discussed that our cloud CDA mechanism
is feasible for cloud computing resource allocation.

analysis, which allows a better interpretation of the measured kinematics of

Binning RAVE stars in metallicity reveals a bigger asymmetric drift
(corresponding to a smaller radial scalelength) for more metal-rich
populations. With the standard assumption of velocity-dispersion independent
radial scalelengths in each metallicity bin, we redetermine the LSR. The new
Str\""omberg equation yields a joint LSR value of V_\sun=3.06 \pm 0.68 km/s,
which is even smaller than the classical value based on Hipparcos data. The
corresponding radial scalelength increases from 1.6 kpc for the metal-rich bin
to 2.9 kpc for the metal-poor bin, with a trend of an even larger scalelength
for young metal-poor stars. When adopting the recent Sch\""onrich value of
V_\sun=12.24 km/s for the LSR, the new Str\""omberg equation yields much larger
individual radial scalelengths of the RAVE subpopulations, which seem
unphysical in part. The new Str\""omberg equation allows a cleaner
interpretation of the kinematic data of disc stars in terms of radial
scalelengths. Lifting the LSR value by a few km/s compared to the classical
value results in strongly increased radial scalelengths with a trend of smaller
values for larger velocity dispersions.

up-to-date information. In this context, fast crawling and indexing of newly
created Web pages has become crucial for search engines, especially because
user traffic to a significant fraction of these new pages (like news, blog and
forum posts) grows really quickly right after they appear, but lasts only for
several days.
  In this paper, we study the problem of timely finding and crawling of such
ephemeral new pages (in terms of user interest). Traditional crawling policies
do not give any particular priority to such pages and may thus crawl them not
quickly enough, and even crawl already obsolete content. We thus propose a new
metric, well thought out for this task, which takes into account the decrease
of user interest for ephemeral pages over time.
  We show that most ephemeral new pages can be found at a relatively small set
of content sources and present a procedure for finding such a set. Our idea is
to periodically recrawl content sources and crawl newly created pages linked
from them, focusing on high-quality (in terms of user interest) content. One of
the main difficulties here is to divide resources between these two activities
in an efficient way. We find the adaptive balance between crawls and recrawls
by maximizing the proposed metric. Further, we incorporate search engine click
logs to give our crawler an insight about the current user demands. Efficiency
of our approach is finally demonstrated experimentally on real-world data.

model lies in its predictive performance in identifying defaulted SMEs. Another
advantage, which is especially relevant for banks, is that the relationship
between the accounting characteristics of SMEs and response is not assumed a

The proposed approach uses the quantile function of the generalized extreme

characteristics to flexibly model covariate effects. Therefore, the usual
assumptions in scoring models of symmetric link function and linear or

the Casimir force has been variously described as a phenomenon resulting ""from
the alteration, by the boundaries, of the zero-point electromagnetic energy"",
or a ""Van der Waals force between the metal plates"" that can be ""computed
without reference to zero point energies"". Neither of these descriptions are
grounded in a consistently quantum mechanical treatment of matter interacting
with the electromagnetic field. However, the Casimir Effect has been
canonically described within the framework of macroscopic quantum
electrodynamics. On this account, the force is seen to arise due to the
coupling of fluctuating currents to the zero-point radiation, and it is in this
restricted sense that the phenomenon requires the existence of zero-point
fields. The conflicting descriptions of the Casimir Effect, on the other hand,
appear to arise from inadequate ontologies in which an unwarranted metaphysical
priority is assigned either to the matter or the fields. Such ontological
errors may have a direct bearing on the problem of the cosmological constant
and the correct prediction of the Casimir force in a state of thermal
equilibrium.

global extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wave propagating in the solar corona. These
intriguing phenomena are observed when the wave interacts with two remote
active regions, and they together exhibit the wave property of this EUV wave.
When the wave approached AR11465, it became weaker and finally disappeared in
the active region, but a few minutes latter a new wavefront appeared behind the
active region, and it was not concentric with the incoming wave. In addition, a
reflected wave was also observed simultaneously on the wave incoming side. When
the wave approached AR11459, it transmitted through the active region directly
and without reflection. The formation of the new wavefront and the transmission
could be explained with diffraction and refraction effects, respectively. We
propose that the different behaviors observed during the interactions may
caused by different speed gradients at the boundaries of the two active
regions. For the origin of the EUV wave, we find that it formed ahead of a
group of expanding loops a few minutes after the start of the loops' expansion,
which represents the initiation of the associated coronal mass ejection (CME).
Based on these results, we conclude that the EUV wave should be a nonlinear
magnetosonic wave or shock driven by the associated CME, which propagated
faster than the ambient fast-mode speed and gradually slowed down to an
ordinary linear wave. Our observations support the hybrid model that includes
both fast wave and slow non-wave components.

then they appeared in 193 A observations after their interaction with a
perpendicular underlaying loop system on the path, in the meantime, the wave
speed decelerated to 343 km/s quickly within a short timescale. The sudden
deceleration of the wave trains and their appearance in 193 A observations
caused by the interaction are interpreted through geometric effect and the
density increase of the guiding loop system, respectively. On the other hand,
with Wavelet and Fourier analysis methods we find that the wave trains has a
common period of 80 s with the associated flare. In addition, a few low
frequencies are also identified in the QFP wave. We propose that the generation
of the period of 80 s was caused by the periodic releasing of energy busts
through some nonlinear processes in magnetic reconnection or the so-called
oscillatory reconnection mechanism, while the low frequencies detected in the
QFP wave were possibly the manifestations of the leakage of pressure-driven
oscillations from the photosphere or chromosphere, which could be an important
source for driving QFP waves in the low corona. Our observational results also
indicate that the properties of the guiding magnetic structure such as the
distributions of magnetic field and density as well as geometry are crucial for
modulating the propagation behaviors of QFP waves. Therefore, QFP waves could
be used for remote diagnostics of the local physical properties of the solar
corona.

each motion is accompanied by a wave that has constant amplitude. Accordingly,
we define the wavefunction as the superposition of the virtual waves of the

while in the traditional formulation it is a local theory. In several
interaction settings we can tell what particle motions arise and explain the
outcomes in simple and tangible terms. Most importantly, the mathematical
foundation of quantum mechanics becomes clear and justified, and we derive the

  arXiv:1306.0969",,"10.1109/TSP.2014.2303422",,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The dual use of radio signals for simultaneous wireless information and power
transfer (SWIPT) has recently drawn significant attention. To meet the
practical requirement that energy receivers (ERs) operate with significantly
higher received power as compared to information receivers (IRs), ERs need to
be deployed in more proximity to the transmitter than IRs. However, due to the
broadcast nature of wireless channels, one critical issue arises that the
messages sent to IRs can be eavesdropped by ERs, which possess better channels
from the transmitter. In this paper, we address this new secrecy communication
problem in a multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) SWIPT system where
one multi-antenna transmitter sends information and energy simultaneously to an
IR and multiple ERs, each with one single antenna. To optimally design transmit
beamforming vectors and their power allocation, two problems are investigated
with different aims: the first problem maximizes the secrecy rate for IR
subject to individual harvested energy constraints of ERs, while the second
problem maximizes the weighted sum-energy transferred to ERs subject to a
secrecy rate constraint for IR. We solve these two non-convex problems
optimally by reformulating each of them into a two-stage problem. First, by
fixing the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) target for ERs (for
the first problem) or IR (for the second problem), we obtain the optimal
beamforming and power allocation solution by applying the technique of
semidefinite relaxation (SDR). Then, the original problems are solved by a
one-dimension search over the optimal SINR target for ERs or IR. Furthermore,
for each of the two studied problems, suboptimal solutions of lower complexity
are also proposed in which the information and energy beamforming vectors are
separately designed with their power allocation.

abundances that have been determined in previous studies of both its UV and
optical spectrum. We computed a small 3D grid of 150 fully line-blanketed, NLTE
model atmospheres incorporating the 8 most abundant metals found in the
atmosphere of that star. We next compared quantitatively the synthetic spectra
that we calculated from these models with three observed spectra having
different resolutions (1 A, 6 A, and 8.7 A) and wavelength ranges. Our findings
are Teff = 29,890 K, log g = 5.46, and log N(He)/N(H) = -2.88, with very small
formal fitting errors. These estimates are in good agreement with those of
previous studies, thus showing that the presence of metals do not affect
significantly the bulk atmospheric properties of Feige 48. We also modeled the
He II line at 1640 A from the STIS spectrum of the star and we found with this
line an effective temperature and a surface gravity that match well the values
obtained with the optical data. We also present a radial velocity curve based
on several years of observing Feige 48 at the MMT. This curve indicates a
precise orbital period of 8.25 h. Coupled to our discovery of a weak but very
real periodicity of 8.25 h in the light curve of Feige 48, that was gathered
during a recent extensive photometric campaign at the Mount Bigelow 1.55 m

has been previously suggested.

structural, transport, thermodynamic, and high pressure measurements. Both the
structural and magnetic transitions are suppressed by Cu doping, and bulk
superconductivity is induced by Cu doping. Superconducting transition
temperature ($T_c$) is initially enhanced from 9.6 to 11.5 K by Cu doping, and
then suppressed with further doping. A phase diagram similar to
NaFe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$As is obtained except that insulating instead of metallic
behavior is observed in extremely overdoped samples. $T_c$'s of underdoped,
optimally doped, and overdoped samples are all notably enhanced by applying
pressure. Although a universal maximum transition temperature ($T_c^{max}$) of
about 31 K under external pressure is observed in underdoped and optimally
doped NaFe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$As, $T_c^{max}$ of NaFe$_{1-x}$Cu$_x$As is monotonously
suppressed by Cu doping, suggesting that impurity potential of Cu is stronger
than Co in NaFeAs. The comparison between Cu and Co doping effect in NaFeAs
indicates that Cu serves as an effective electron dopant with strong impurity
potential, but part of the doped electrons are localized and do not fill the
energy bands as predicted by the rigid-band model.

freedom (DoF) with infinite independent channel extensions, but its performance
is largely unknown for a finite number of possibly dependent channel
extensions. In this paper, we consider a $K$-user $M_t \times M_r$ MIMO
interference channel (IC) with arbitrary number of channel extensions $T$ and
arbitrary channel diversity order $L$ (i.e., each channel matrix is a generic
linear combination of $L$ fixed basis matrices). We study the maximum DoF
achievable via vector space IA in the single beam case (i.e. each user sends
one data stream). We prove that the total number of users $K$ that can
communicate interference-free using linear transceivers is upper bounded by
$NL+N^2/4$, where $N = \min\{M_tT, M_rT \}$. An immediate consequence of this
upper bound is that for a SISO IC the DoF in the single beam case is no more
than $\min\left\{\sqrt{ 5K/4}, L + T/4\right\}$. When the channel extensions
are independent, i.e. $ L$ achieves the maximum $M_r M_t T $, we show that this
maximum DoF lies in $[M_r+M_t-1, M_r+M_t]$ regardless of $T$. Unlike the
well-studied constant MIMO IC case, the main difficulty is how to deal with a
hybrid system of equations (zero-forcing condition) and inequalities (full rank
condition). Our approach combines algebraic tools that deal with equations with
an induction analysis that indirectly considers the inequalities.

partial differential equation, which is only observed through noisy
measurements at discrete time intervals. In particular, we focus on the case
where Eulerian measurements are obtained from the time and space evolving
vector field, whose evolution obeys the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations
defined on a torus. This context is particularly relevant to the area of
numerical weather forecasting and data assimilation. We will adopt a Bayesian
formulation resulting from a particular regularization that ensures the problem
is well posed. In the context of Monte Carlo based inference, it is a
challenging task to obtain samples from the resulting high dimensional
posterior on the initial condition. In real data assimilation applications it
is common for computational methods to invoke the use of heuristics and
Gaussian approximations. The resulting inferences are biased and not
well-justified in the presence of non-linear dynamics and observations. On the
other hand, Monte Carlo methods can be used to assimilate data in a principled
manner, but are often perceived as inefficient in this context due to the
high-dimensionality of the problem. In this work we will propose a generic
Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampling approach for high dimensional inverse
problems that overcomes these difficulties. The method builds upon Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, which are currently considered as benchmarks for
evaluating data assimilation algorithms used in practice. In our numerical
examples, the proposed SMC approach achieves the same accuracy as MCMC but in a
much more efficient manner.

that inclusion of weak repulsion leads to a dynamical stripe phase for
two-component fermions in a similar setup. Finally, by preparing a topological
insulating state in a partially occupied kagome lattice, we find that the
topological chiral current decays but exhibits an interesting oscillating
dynamics during the nonequilibrium transport. Given the broad variety of

suggests new possibilities to use geometrical effects and their dynamics in

with two tuning parameters whose performance impact across the range of test
matrices is studied and for which reasonable choices are proposed. This leads
to a hardware-independent (""catch-all"") sparse matrix format, which achieves
very high efficiency for all test matrices across all hardware platforms.

two parameters associated with it, namely, the Brans-Dicke parameter, $\omega$,
and the potential-scalar field dependency parameter $n$ respectively. V.
Husain's work on exact solution for null fluid collapse in 1996 has influenced
many authors to follow his way to find the end-state of the
homogeneous/in-homogeneous dust cloud. Vaidya's metric is used all over to
follow the nature of future outgoing radial null geodesics. Detecting whether
the central singularity is naked or wrapped by an event horizon, by the
existence of future directed radial null geodesic emitted in past from the
singularity is the basic objective. To point out the existence of positive
trajectory tangent solution, both particular parametric cases(through tabular
forms) and wide range contouring process have been applied. Precisely, perfect
fluid's EoS satisfies a wide range of phenomena : from dust to exotic fluid
like dark energy. We have used the EoS parameter $k$ to determine the end state
of collapse in different cosmological era. Our main target is to check low
$\omega$ (more deviations from Einstein gravity-more Brans Dicke effect) and
negative $k$ zones. This particularly throws light on the nature of the
end-state of collapse in accelerated expansion in Brans Dicke gravity. It is
seen that for positive values of EoS parameter $k$, the collapse results in a
black hole, whereas for negative values of $k$, naked singularity is the only
outcome. It is also to be noted that ""low $\omega$"" leads to the possibility of
getting more naked singularities even for a non-accelerating universe.

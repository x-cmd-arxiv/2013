previously constrained many-body calculations. The pion selfenergy includes
$Nh$ and $\Delta h$ excitations with short-range correlations, while the $\rho$
selfenergy incorporates the same dressing of its $2\pi$ cloud with a full
3-momentum dependence and vertex corrections, as well as direct resonance-hole

photo-absorption spectra and $\pi N\to\rho N$ scattering. Our calculations
account for in-medium decays of type $\omega N\to \pi N^{(*)}, \pi\pi

deviations of the in-medium $\omega$ width from a linear behavior in density,
with important contributions from spacelike $\rho$ propagators. The $\omega$
width from the $\rho\pi$ cloud may reach up to 200 MeV at normal nuclear matter

None of the six targets were detected, with 3 sigma upper limits ranging from
51-239 mJy. These limits are significantly below the expected fluxes from SED
fitting. Two potential causes of the null detections were explored - companion
stars and contamination. To investigate the possible influence of companion
stars, imaging data were analyzed from new AO data from the MMT and archival
HST, NIRI, and POSS/2MASS data. The images are sensitive to all stellar
companions beyond a radius of 1-94 AU. One target is identified as a binary
system, but with a separation too large to impact the disk. While the
gravitational effects of a companion do not appear to provide an explanation
for the submm upper limits, the majority of the IRAS excess targets show
evidence for contaminating sources, based on investigation of higher resolution
WISE and archival Spitzer and Herschel images. Finally, the exploratory submm
measurements of the WISE excess source suggest that the hot dust present around
these targets is not matched by a comparable population of colder, outer dust.
More extensive and more sensitive Herschel observations of WISE excess sources

Of the feature deaths that remove visible magnetic flux from the photosphere,
the vast majority do so by a process that merely disperses the
previously-detected flux so that it is too small and too weak to be detected.
The behavior of the ensemble average of these dispersals is not consistent with
a model of simple planar diffusion, suggesting that the dispersal is
constrained by the evolving photospheric velocity field. We introduce the
concept of the partial lifetime of magnetic features, and show that the partial
lifetime due to Cancellation of magnetic flux, 22 h, is 3 times slower than
previous measurements of the flux turnover time. This indicates that prior
feature-based estimates of the flux replacement time may be too short, in
contrast with the tendency for this quantity to decrease as resolution and
instrumentation have improved. This suggests that dispersal of flux to smaller
scales is more important for the replacement of magnetic fields in the quiet
Sun than observed bipolar cancellation. We conclude that processes on spatial
scales smaller than those visible to Hinode dominate the processes of flux
emergence and cancellation, and therefore also the quantity of magnetic flux
that threads the photosphere.

homogeneous with respect to a grading by an affine monoid. The Segre product is
a related construction that combines two multigraded rings. The quotient ring
by a toric fiber product of two ideals is a subring of the Segre product, but
in general this inclusion is strict. We contrast the two constructions and show
that any Segre product can be presented as a toric fiber product without
changing the involved quotient rings. This allows to apply previous results

dense in their toric fiber product, and for the map from the Segre product to
the toric fiber product to be finite. We give an example that shows that the
quotient ring of a toric fiber product of normal ideals need not be normal. In
rings with Veronese type gradings, we find examples of toric fiber products

allows to analytically predict causality-driven changes of diffusion speed in
non-Markovian temporal networks. Validating our predictions in six data sets,
we show that - compared to the time-aggregated network - non-Markovian
characteristics can lead to both a slow-down, or speed-up of diffusion which
can even outweigh the decelerating effect of community structures in the static
topology. Thus, non-Markovian properties of temporal networks constitute an
important additional dimension of complexity in time-varying complex systems.

scanning efficiency is significantly lowered. More recently, a new technique
called volume-selective z-shim was proposed to implement z-shim compensation to
only specific slices with large susceptibility effects. The high imaging
efficiency of volume selective z-shim makes it possible to substitute
conventional EPI for whole brain studies. In this study two fMRI experiments
were conducted to compare volume- selective z-shim and conventional EPI while
subjects performed tasks on face stimuli. The comparison was focused on three
brain regions: amygdala, hippocampus, and fusiform gyrus. Our results indicate
that despite fewer volumes collected during the same amount of scan time,
volume-selective z-shim showed statistically higher activation in brain regions
susceptible to signal loss while minimal differences were observed elsewhere.

""unfrustrated"" case), the system undergoes a transition from the SF to the SLMI

two amplitudes differ in sign (the ""frustrated"" case), the SF is unstable to
switching on a superlattice potential and also exists only up to a finite value
of the next nearest neighbor hopping. This part of the phase diagram is
dominated by the BO phase which breaks translation symmetry spontaneously even
in the absence of the superlattice potential and can thus be characterized by a
bond order parameter. The transition from BO to SLMI appears to be first order.

density provided by mean field calculations and supplemented, at high energies,

chromatin density might influence the time required for proteins to find
specific DNA binding sites. The spatial variation of chromatin density within
mouse olfactory sensory neurons is determined from soft X-ray tomography
reconstructions of five nuclei. We show that there is a division of the nuclear
space into regions of low-density euchromatin and high-density heterochromatin.
Volume exclusion experienced by a diffusing protein caused by this varying
density of chromatin is modeled by a repulsive potential. The value of the
potential at a given point in space is chosen to be proportional to the density
of chromatin at that location. The constant of proportionality, called the
volume exclusivity, provides a model parameter that determines the strength of
volume exclusion. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the mean time for a
protein to locate a binding site localized in euchromatin is minimized for a
finite, non-zero volume exclusivity. For binding sites in heterochromatin, the
mean time is minimized when the volume exclusivity is zero (the protein
experiences no volume exclusion). An analytical theory is developed to explain
these results. The theory suggests that for binding sites in euchromatin there
is an optimal level of volume exclusivity that balances a reduction in the
volume searched in finding the binding site, with the height of effective
potential barriers the protein must cross during the search process.

  Sharing","JCDL 2013",,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The web is trapped in the ""perpetual now"", and when users traverse from page
to page, they are seeing the state of the web resource (i.e., the page) as it
exists at the time of the click and not necessarily at the time when the link
was made. Thus, a temporal discrepancy can arise between the resource at the
time the page author created a link to it and the time when a reader follows
the link. This is especially important in the context of social media: the ease
of sharing links in a tweet or Facebook post allows many people to author web
content, but the space constraints combined with poor awareness by authors
often prevents sufficient context from being generated to determine the intent
of the post. If the links are clicked as soon as they are shared, the temporal
distance between sharing and clicking is so small that there is little to no
difference in content. However, not all clicks occur immediately, and a delay
of days or even hours can result in reading something other than what the
author intended. We introduce the concept of a user's temporal intention upon
publishing a link in social media. We investigate the features that could be
extracted from the post, the linked resource, and the patterns of social
dissemination to model this user intention. Finally, we analyze the historical
integrity of the shared resources in social media across time. In other words,
how much is the knowledge of the author's intent beneficial in maintaining the
consistency of the story being told through social posts and in enriching the
archived content coverage and depth of vulnerable resources?

the purely on-shell construction, the notion of gauge-anomaly is replaced by
the difficulty to consistently impose locality on the unitary S-matrix.

microwave background are of primordial origin, they may herald modifications to
the slow roll inflationary paradigm on the largest scales. We study the
possibility that the origin of the large scale power suppression is a
modification of initial conditions during slow roll as a result of a pre-slow
roll phase during which the inflaton evolves rapidly. This stage is manifest in
a potential in the equations for the Gaussian fluctuations during slow roll and
modify the power spectra of scalar perturbations via an initial condition
transfer function $\mathcal{T}(k)$. We provide a general analytical study of
its large and small scale properties and analyze the impact of these initial
conditions on the infrared aspects of typical test scalar fields. The infrared
behavior of massless minimally coupled test scalar field theories leads to the
dynamical generation of mass and anomalous dimensions, both depend
non-analytically on $\mathcal{T}(0)$. During inflation all quanta decay into
many quanta even of the same field because of the lack of kinematic thresholds.
The decay leads to a quantum entangled state of sub and superhorizon quanta
with correlations across the horizon. We find the modifications of the decay
width and the entanglement entropy from the initial conditions. In all cases,
initial conditions from a ``fast-roll'' stage that lead to a suppression in the
scalar power spectrum at large scales also result in a suppression of the
dynamically generated masses, anomalous dimensions and decay widths.

involve a $W$ or $Z$ boson and a lepton. This study is based on ILC beam

$\widetilde{\chi}_1^0$-pair production within a simplified model. The bRPV

can straightforwardly be integrated order by order in epsilon in dimensional
regularization. The boundary conditions are also particularly transparent in
this setup. We identify the class of functions relevant to this problem to all

compared to the classical second-parameter twin NGC 288, with similar
metallicity, but different horizontal branch type and much lower total mass,
the proton-capture processing in stars of NGC 362 seems to be more extreme,
confirming previous analysis. We discovered the presence of a secondary RGB
sequence, redder than the bulk of the RGB: a preliminary estimate shows that
this sequence comprises about 6% of RGB stars. Our spectroscopic data and
literature photometry indicate that this sequence is populated almost
exclusively by giants rich in Ba, and probably rich in all s-process elements,

based on the pre-outburst light curve of a contact eclipsing binary with a
rapidly decaying orbital period. Using published data, I show that the period
decay timescale P/Pdot of V1309 Sco decreased from ~1000 to ~170 years in less
than about 6 years, which implies a very high value of second period
derivative. I argue that V1309 Sco experienced an onset of dynamical mass loss
through the outer Lagrange point, which eventually obscured the binary. The
photosphere of the resulting continuous optically-thick outflow expands as the
mass-loss rate increases, explaining the ~200 day rise to optical maximum. The
model yields the mass-loss rate of the binary star as a function of time and
fits the observed light curve remarkably well. It is also possible to
observationally constrain the properties of the surface layers undergoing the
dynamical mass loss. V1309 Sco is thus a prototype of a new class of stellar
transients distinguished by a slow rise to optical maximum that are driven by
dynamical mass loss from a binary. I discuss implications of these findings for
stellar transients and other suggested common envelope events.

force carriers it may cool and collapse to form complex structures within the

recently and termed ""Double-Disk Dark Matter"" (DDDM). In this paper we consider
the possibility that DDDM remains in a cosmologically long-lived excited state
and can scatter exothermically on nuclei (ExoDDDM). We investigate the current
status of ExoDDDM direct detection and find that ExoDDDM can readily explain
the recently announced ~3 sigma excess observed at CDMS-Si, with almost all of
the 90% best-fit parameter space in complete consistency with limits from other
experiments, including XENON10 and XENON100. In the absence of
isospin-dependent couplings, this consistency requires light DM with mass
typically in the 5-15 GeV range. The hypothesis of ExoDDDM can be tested in
direct detection experiments through its peaked recoil spectra, reduced annual
modulation amplitude, and, in some cases, its novel time-dependence. We also
discuss future direct detection prospects and additional indirect constraints
from colliders and solar capture of ExoDDDM. As theoretical proof-of-principle,
we combine the features of exothermic DM models and DDDM models to construct a

graphene and a stack of parallel graphene sheets at arbitrary angles of
incidence. It is found that the behavior is qualitatively different for
transverse magnetic (or p-polarized) and transverse electric (or s-polarized)
waves. In particular, the absorbance of single-layer graphene attains minimum
(maximum) for p (s) polarization, at the angle of total internal reflection
when the light comes from a medium with a higher dielectric constant. In the
case of equal dielectric constants of the media above and beneath graphene, for
grazing incidence graphene is almost 100% transparent to p-polarized waves and
acts as a tunable mirror for the s-polarization. These effects are enhanced for
the stack of graphene sheets, so the system can work as a broad band polarizer.
It is shown further that a periodic stack of graphene layers has the properties
of an one-dimensional photonic crystal, with gaps (or stop--bands) at certain
frequencies. When an incident EM wave is reflected from this photonic crystal,
the tunability of the graphene conductivity renders the possibility of
controlling the gaps, and the structure can operate as a tunable
spectral--selective mirror.

the putative wind of less than 1.3EE{-5} solar masses per year, assuming a
speed of 10 km/s and solar abundances for the wind. In a helium-enriched case,
the best line to constrain the mass loss would be He I 10,830 A. We confirm the

discussed by Patat et al., but also find evidence for 6613.56 A Diffuse

These results, together with the previous observational work on the normal SNe

conjecturally connected since the seminal work of Beliavin, Polyakov, and

dimensions. A long-standing question [ItTh87] concerns whether there is a
direct link between these structures, that is, whether the Virasoro algebra
representations of CFT, the distinctive feature of CFT in two dimensions, can
be found within lattice models of statistical mechanics. We give a positive
answer to this question for the discrete Gaussian free field and for the Ising
model, by connecting the structures of discrete complex analysis in the lattice
models with the Virasoro symmetry that is expected to describe their scaling
limits. This allows for a tight connection of a number of objects from the
lattice model world and the field theory one. In particular, our results link
the CFT local fields with lattice local fields introduced in [GHP19] and the
probabilistic formulation of the lattice model with the continuum correlation
functions. Our construction is a decisive step towards establishing the
conjectured correspondence between the correlation functions of the CFT fields
and those of the lattice local fields. In particular, together with the
upcoming [CHI19], our construction will complete the picture initiated in

0.05 g cm^{-2}, which is consistent with a similar sample of clumps associated

correlated with the mass of their natal clump. Young B stars appear to be
significantly more luminous in the ultraviolet than predicted by current

reproducing most of the solar magnetic field dynamical characteristics.
However, considering that such models operate only above a lower magnetic field
threshold, they do not provide an appropriate magnetic field regeneration
process characterizing a self-sustainable dynamo. In this work we consider the
existence of an additional \alpha-effect to the Babcock-Leighton scenario in a
mean-field axisymmetric kinematic numerical model. Both poloidal field
regeneration mechanisms are treated with two different strength-limiting
factors. Apart from the solar anti-symmetric parity behavior, the main solar
features are reproduced: cyclic polarity reversals, mid-latitudinal equatorward
migration of strong toroidal field, poleward migration of polar surface radial
fields, and the quadrature phase shift between both. Long-term variability of
the solutions exhibits lengthy periods of minimum activity followed by
posterior recovery, akin to the observed Maunder Minimum. Based on the analysis
of the residual activity during periods of minimum activity, we suggest that
these are caused by a predominance of the \alpha-effect over the
Babcock-Leighton mechanism in regenerating the poloidal field.

transitions in plants. Until recently, however, a genome-wide view of this
transition has been obscured by a dearth of appropriate data and the lack of
appropriate population genomic methods to interpret such data. Here, we present
novel analyses detailing the origin of the selfing species, Capsella rubella,
which recently split from its outcrossing sister, Capsella grandiflora. Due to
the recency of the split, most variation within C. rubella is found within C.
grandiflora. We can therefore identify genomic regions where two C. rubella
individuals have inherited the same or different segments of ancestral
diversity (i.e. founding haplotypes) present in C. rubella's founder(s). Based
on this analysis, we show that C. rubella was founded by multiple individuals
drawn from a diverse ancestral population closely related to extant C.
grandiflora, that drift and selection have rapidly homogenized most of this
ancestral variation since C. rubella's founding, and that little novel
variation has accumulated within this time. Despite the extensive loss of
ancestral variation, the approximately 25% of the genome for which two C.
rubella individuals have inherited different founding haplotypes makes up
roughly 90% of the genetic variation between them. To extend these findings, we
develop a coalescent model that utilizes the inferred frequency of founding
haplotypes and variation within founding haplotypes to estimate that C. rubella
was founded by a potentially large number of individuals 50-100 kya, and has
subsequently experienced a 20X reduction in its effective population size. As
population genomic data from an increasing number of outcrossing/selfing pairs
are generated, analyses like this here will facilitate a fine-scaled view of
the evolutionary and demographic impact of the transition to
self-fertilization.

loss still occurs even when multiple paths exist between source and destination

computes set of paths which can be used when primary path is not available and

as the charge transfer used to produce negative electron affinity surfaces and
adjust Schottky barrier heights, drastically alter the character of the Fermi

vary weakly across an isobaric chain. However, they change strongly with
nuclear mass and range from a_a~10 MeV at mass A~10 to a_a~22 MeV at A~240.
Following the considerations of a Hohenberg-Kohn functional for nuclear

neutron and proton densities, even when those densities are simultaneously
affected by significant symmetry-energy and Coulomb effects. These results
facilitate extracting the symmetry coefficients from Skyrme-Hartree-Fock (SHF)

the literature. For the parametrizations, we catalog novel short-wavelength

constraints significantly widen, but the normal value of energy a_a^V and the

a_a^V=(30.2-33.7) MeV and L=(35-70) MeV, with those values being again strongly
positively correlated along the diagonal of their combined region. Inclusion of

develop two composite likelihood ratio tests for detecting balancing selection.
Using simulations, we show that these methods outperform competing methods
under a variety of assumptions and demographic models. We apply the new methods
to whole-genome human data, and find a number of previously-identified loci

Additionally, we find evidence for many novel candidates, the strongest of

generation resources increases, control of flexible resources will become
important to mitigating the fluctuations due to these new renewable resources.
Flexible resources may include new or existing synchronous generators as well
as new energy storage devices. Optimal placement and sizing of energy storage
to minimize costs of integrating renewable resources is a difficult
optimization problem. Further,optimal planning procedures typically do not
consider the effect of the time dependence of operations and may lead to
unsatisfactory results. Here, we use an optimal energy storage control
algorithm to develop a heuristic procedure for energy storage placement and
sizing. We perform operational simulation under various time profiles of
intermittent generation, loads and interchanges (artificially generated or from
historical data) and accumulate statistics of the usage of storage at each node
under the optimal dispatch. We develop a greedy heuristic based on the
accumulated statistics to obtain a minimal set of nodes for storage placement.
The quality of the heuristic is explored by comparing our results to the
obvious heuristic of placing storage at the renewables for IEEE benchmarks and
real-world network topologies.

for paradigmatic features such as entanglement[1] and the Aharonov-Bohm
effect[2,3]. Non-locality comes in two ""flavours"": a \emph{kinematic
non-locality}-- arising from the structure of the Hilbert space--[4-6] and a
\emph{dynamical non-locality}-- arising from the quantum equations of
motion--[2,3,5,6]. Despite of its main role in quantum information processing,
kinematic non-locality is unable to induce any change in the probability
distributions, so that the ""action-at-a-distance"" cannot manifest[5,6].
Conversely, dynamical non-locality does create explicit changes in probability,
though in a ""causality-preserving"" manner[6,7]. Recently, the origin of the
kinematic non-locality was related to the uncertainty principle[8], here we
trace the origin of dynamical non-locality to the superposition principle. This
relation adds to the more fundamental understanding of the nature of quantum
dynamics and allows us to establish and identify how the uncertainty and the
superposition principles determine the non-local character of the outcome of a
quantum measurement. Thus, dynamical non-locality emerges as the responsible of
the breakdown of the dynamical classical realism[9] and therefore, as key
feature in the classical-quantum transition. Most importantly, being based on
group theoretical and path integral formulations, our formulation admits
immediate generalizations and extensions to, e.g., quantum field theory.

regression, thus Slores can be integrated with any existing solver to improve
the efficiency. We have evaluated Slores using high-dimensional data sets from
different applications. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Slores
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art screening rules and the efficiency of

kinetic stability, provides a comprehensive understanding of protein folding.
The thermodynamic theory is misleading because it assumes that free energy is
the exclusive dominant mechanism of protein folding, and attributes the
structural transition from one characteristic state to another to energy
barriers. Conversely, the concept of kinetic stability overemphasizes dominant
mechanisms that are related to kinetic factors. This article explores the
stability condition of protein structures from the viewpoint of meso-science,
paying attention to the compromise in the competition between minimum free
energy and other dominant mechanisms. Based on our study of complex systems, we
propose that protein folding is a meso-scale, dissipative, nonlinear and
non-equilibrium process that is dominated by the compromise between free energy
and other dominant mechanisms such as environmental factors. Consequently, a
protein shows dynamic structures, featuring characteristic states that appear
alternately and dynamically, only one of which is the state with minimum free
energy. To provide evidence for this concept, we analyzed the time series of
energetic and structural changes of three simulations of protein
folding/unfolding. Our results indicate that thorough consideration of the
multiple dynamic characteristic structures generated by multiple mechanisms may
be the key to understanding protein folding.

full-duplex orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems is proposed. The
proposed scheme increases the amount of cancellable selfinterference power by
suppressing the effect of both transmitter and receiver oscillator phase noise.
The proposed scheme consists of two main phases, an estimation phase and a
cancellation phase. In the estimation phase, the minimum mean square error
estimator is used to jointly estimate the transmitter and receiver phase noise
associated with the incoming self-interference signal. In the cancellation
phase, the estimated phase noise is used to suppress the intercarrier
interference caused by the phase noise associated with the incoming

determined self-consistently from the quark level, where the quark confinement
is taken into account in terms of a scalar-vector harmonic oscillator
potential. The strength of such confinement potential for $u,d$ quarks is
constrained by the properties of finite nuclei, while the one for $s$ quark is
limited by the properties of nuclei with a $\Lambda$ hyperon. These two
strengths are not same, which represents the SU(3) symmetry breaking
effectively in the QMF model. Also, we use an enhanced $\Sigma$ coupling with
the vector meson, and both $\Sigma$ and $\Xi$ hyperon potentials can be
properly described in the model. The effects of the SU(3) symmetry breaking on
the neutron star structures are then studied. We find that the SU(3) breaking
shifts earlier the hyperon onset density and makes hyperons more abundant in
the star, in comparisons with the results of the SU(3) symmetry case. However,
it does not affect much the star's maximum mass. The maximum masses are found
to be $1.62 M_{\odot}$ with hyperons and $1.88 M_{\odot}$ without hyperons. The
present neutron star model is shown to have limitations on explaining the

including machine learning, statistics, and applied mathematics. The mixed-norm
regularization based on the l1q norm with q>1 is attractive in many
applications of regression and classification in that it facilitates group
sparsity in the model. The resulting optimization problem is, however,
challenging to solve due to the inherent structure of the mixed-norm
regularization. Existing work deals with special cases with q=1, 2, infinity,
and they cannot be easily extended to the general case. In this paper, we
propose an efficient algorithm based on the accelerated gradient method for
solving the general l1q-regularized problem. One key building block of the
proposed algorithm is the l1q-regularized Euclidean projection (EP_1q). Our
theoretical analysis reveals the key properties of EP_1q and illustrates why
EP_1q for the general q is significantly more challenging to solve than the
special cases. Based on our theoretical analysis, we develop an efficient
algorithm for EP_1q by solving two zero finding problems. To further improve
the efficiency of solving large dimensional mixed-norm regularized problems, we
propose a screening method which is able to quickly identify the inactive
groups, i.e., groups that have 0 components in the solution. This may lead to
substantial reduction in the number of groups to be entered to the
optimization. An appealing feature of our screening method is that the data set
needs to be scanned only once to run the screening. Compared to that of solving
the mixed-norm regularized problems, the computational cost of our screening
test is negligible. The key of the proposed screening method is an accurate
sensitivity analysis of the dual optimal solution when the regularization

  We also consider the problem setting when the cost of an edge can be
different for the two possible orientations. The problem becomes substantially
more difficult already for the simpler requirement of $k$-edge-connectivity.

presents a state diagram that depicts the comparative study of various

the particular situation. Using this representation, it becomes much easier to
understand what is going on inside the system and why a different set of
processes is a candidate for the allocation of the CPU at different time. The

fluctuating magnetic fields similar to spacecraft observations at 1 AU. The
turbulence models include a Kolmogorov-like magnetic field power spectrum
containing a broad range of spatial scales from those that lead to large-scale

energetic charged particles in turbulent magnetic fields are numerically
integrated. Spacecraft observations are mimicked by collecting particles in
small windows when they pass the windows at a distance of 1 AU. We show that
small-scale gradients in the intensity of energetic particles and velocity
dispersions observed by spacecraft can be reproduced using the foot-point

source of converging evidence about specific aspects of neural functions and
dysfunctions under certain pathological conditions. Focal changes in cortical
blood flow are tightly coupled with the changes in neuronal activity. This
constitutes the option to map the hemodynamic response and infer principles of

mid-infrared flux excess have been found to also show TiO bands in emission.
The mid-infrared dust emission and the TiO band emission indicate that these
stars have large amounts of hot circumstellar dust and gas in close proximity
to the central star. The luminosities of the sources are typically several
thousand L_sun while the effective temperatures are 4000-8000 K. Such stars
could be post-AGB stars of mass 0.4-0.8 M_sun or pre-main-sequence stars (young
stellar objects) with masses of 7-19 M_sun. If the stars are pre-main-sequence
stars, they are substantially cooler and younger than stars at the birth line
where Galactic protostars are first supposed to become optically visible out of
their molecular clouds. They should therefore be hidden in their present
evolutionary state. The second explanation for these stars is that they are
post-AGB or post-RGB stars that have recently undergone a binary interaction
when the red giant of the binary system filled its Roche lobe. Being
oxygen-rich, they have gone through this process before becoming carbon stars.
Most of the stars vary slowly on timescales of 1000 days or more suggesting a
changing circumstellar environment. Apart from the slow variations, most stars
also show variability with periods of tens to hundreds of days. One star shows
a period that is rapidly decreasing and we speculate that this star may have
accreted a large blob of gas and dust onto a disk whose orbital radius is
shrinking rapidly. Another star has Cepheid-like pulsations of rapidly
increasing amplitude suggesting a rapid rate of evolution. Seven stars show
quasi-periodic variability and one star has a light curve similar to that of an
eclipsing binary.

with the technique of `dithering'. A number of subexposures is taken with
sub-pixel shifts in order to record structures on scales smaller than a pixel.
The standard method to combine such exposures, `Drizzle', averages after
reversing the displacements, including rotations and distortions. More
sophisticated methods are available to produce, e.g., Nyquist sampled
representations of band-limited inputs. While the combined images produced by
these methods can be of high quality, their use as input for forward-modelling
techniques in gravitational lensing is still not optimal, because the residual
artefacts still affect the modelling results in unpredictable ways. In this
paper we argue for an overall modelling approach that takes into account the
dithering and the lensing without the intermediate product of a combined image.
As one building block we introduce an alternative approach to combine dithered
images by direct model fitting with a least-squares approach including a
regularization constraint. We present tests with simulated and real data that
show the quality of the results. The additional effects of gravitational
lensing and the convolution with an instrumental point spread function can be

states are constant and not influenced by the spatial variation of the energy
gap \Delta. Outer stripes have a larger energy than inner stripes. A mazelike
pattern in the electronic states at E = +-\Delta has been observed all over the

coexists with the superconductivity and locally breaks the symmetry of the two

possible in classical systems. We then study the distribution function of the
work done on a small system initially prepared at thermal equilibrium. It is
found that the work fluctuations can be significantly reduced via shortcuts to
adiabatic processes. For example, in the classical case probabilities of having
very large or almost zero work values are suppressed. In the quantum case
negative work may be totally removed from the otherwise non-positive-definite
work values. We also apply our findings to a micro Otto-cycle-based heat
engine. It is shown that the use of shortcuts, which directly enhances the
engine output power, can also increase the heat engine efficiency
substantially, in both quantum and classical regimes.

Source parameters resulting from detailed spectral-energy-distribution modeling

In low-synchrotron-peaked blazars, hadronic models exhibit substantially higher
maximum degrees of X-ray and gamma-ray polarization than leptonic models, which
may be within reach for existing X-ray and gamma-ray polarimeters. In
high-synchrotron-peaked blazars (with electron-synchrotron-dominated X-ray

polarization, but substantially higher maximum gamma-ray polarization in
hadronic models than leptonic ones. These predictions are particularly relevant
in view of the new generation of balloon-borne X-ray polarimeters (and possibly
GEMS, if revived), and the ability of Fermi-LAT to measure gamma-ray
polarization at < 200 MeV. We suggest observational strategies combining

WKB solutions to semilinear hyperbolic initial-value problems issued from
highly-oscillating initial data with large amplitudes. The compatibility
condition involves the hyperbolic operator, the fundamental phase associated
with the initial oscillation, and the semilinear source term; it states roughly
that hyperbolicity is preserved around resonances.
  If the compatibility condition is satisfied, the solutions are defined over
time intervals independent of the wavelength, and the associated WKB solutions
are stable under a large class of initial perturbations. If the compatibility
condition is not satisfied, resonances are exponentially amplified, and
arbitrarily small initial perturbations can destabilize the WKB solutions in
small time.
  The amplification mechanism is based on the observation that in frequency
space, resonances correspond to points of weak hyperbolicity. At such points,
the behavior of the system depends on the lower order terms through the
compatibility condition.
  The analysis relies, in the unstable case, on a short-time Duhamel
representation formula for solutions of zeroth-order pseudo-differential
equations.

solar-flare events, and convey information about energetic-particle production
in these events, and their interaction in the solar atmosphere. The
annihilation of positrons leads to another type of cosmic gamma-ray source. The
characteristic annihilation gamma-rays at 511 keV have been measured long ago

determining the structure of neutron stars and the evolution of core-collapsing

quantity in the case of unhomogeneous matter. Indeed, nuclear matter
traditionally addressed by mean-field models is uniform while clusters are
known to exist in the dilute baryonic matter which constitutes the main
component of compact objects outer shells. In the present work we investigate
the meaning of symmetry energy in the case of clusterized systems and the
sensitivity of the proto-neutron star composition and equation of state to the
effective interaction. To this aim an improved Nuclear Statistical Equilibrium
(NSE) model is developed, where the same effective interaction is consistently
used to determine the clusters and unbound particles energy functionals in the
self-consistent mean-field approximation. In the same framework, in-medium
modifications to the cluster energies due to the presence of the nuclear gas
are evaluated. We show that the excluded volume effect does not exhaust the
in-medium effects and an extra isospin and density dependent energy shift has
to be considered to consistently determine the composition of subsaturation
stellar matter. The symmetry energy of diluted matter is seen to depend on the
isovector properties of the effective interaction, but its behavior with
density and its quantitative value are strongly modified by clusterization.

irradiate detectors with soft protons has been constructed at the Van-de-Graaff

advantages are a high flux uniformity over a large area, to enable irradiations
of large detectors, and a monitoring system for the applied fluence, the beam
uniformity, and the spectrum, that allows testing of detector prototypes in
early development phases, when readout electronics are not yet available. Two

radiation produced in the atmosphere of the Sun and of other stars requires
solving a radiative transfer problem that can be very complex, especially when
the main interest lies in modeling the spectral line polarization produced by
scattering processes and the Hanle and Zeeman effects. One of the difficulties
is that the plasma of a stellar atmosphere can be highly inhomogeneous and
dynamic, which implies the need to solve the non-equilibrium problem of the
generation and transfer of polarized radiation in realistic three-dimensional
(3D) stellar atmospheric models. Here we present PORTA, an efficient multilevel
radiative transfer code we have developed for the simulation of the spectral
line polarization caused by scattering processes and the Hanle and Zeeman
effects in 3D models of stellar atmospheres. The numerical method of solution
is based on the non-linear multigrid iterative method and on a novel
short-characteristics formal solver of the Stokes-vector transfer equation
which uses monotonic B\'ezier interpolation. Therefore, with PORTA the
computing time needed to obtain at each spatial grid point the self-consistent
values of the atomic density matrix (which quantifies the excitation state of
the atomic system) scales linearly with the total number of grid points.
Another crucial feature of PORTA is its parallelization strategy, which allows
us to speed up the numerical solution of complicated 3D problems by several
orders of magnitude with respect to sequential radiative transfer approaches,
given its excellent linear scaling with the number of available processors. The
PORTA code can also be conveniently applied to solve the simpler 3D radiative
transfer problem of unpolarized radiation in multilevel systems.

our capability to measure surface effects, we also investigate the dependency
of these surface effects on the stellar parameters. Our results suggest a
dependence of the magnitude of the surface effect on the mixing length
parameter which also, but only minimally, affects the determination of stellar

by small-scale dark matter structures. These anomalies offer the prospect of
testing a fundamental prediction of the cold dark matter (CDM) cosmological
model: the existence of numerous substructures that are too small to host
visible galaxies. In two previous studies we found that the number of subhalos
in the six high-resolution simulations of CDM galactic halos of the Aquarius
project is not sufficient to account for the observed frequency of flux ratio
anomalies seen in selected quasars from the CLASS survey. These studies were
limited by the small number of halos used, their narrow range of masses (1-2E12
solar masses) and the small range of lens ellipticities considered. We address
these shortcomings by investigating the lensing properties of a large sample of
halos with a wide range of masses in two sets of high resolution simulations of
cosmological volumes and comparing them to a currently best available sample of
radio quasars. We find that, as expected, substructures do not change the
flux-ratio probability distribution of image pairs and triples with large
separations, but they have a significant effect on the distribution at small
separations. For such systems, CDM substructures can account for a substantial
fraction of the observed flux-ratio anomalies. For large close-pair separation
systems, the discrepancies existing between the observed flux ratios and
predictions from smooth halo models are attributed to simplifications inherent
in these models which do not take account of fine details in the lens mass
distributions.

properties of atomic nuclei. As such, it correlates strongly with observables
in finite nuclei that depend on neutron-to-proton imbalance and the nuclear
symmetry energy that characterizes the equation of state of neutron-rich
matter. A rich worldwide experimental program involving studies with rare
isotopes, parity violating electron scattering, and astronomical observations
is devoted to pinning down the isovector sector of nuclear models. Purpose: We
assess the theoretical systematic and statistical uncertainties of neutron-skin
thickness and relate them to the equation of state of nuclear matter, and in
particular to nuclear symmetry energy parameters. Methods: We use the nuclear
superfluid Density Functional Theory with several Skyrme energy density
functionals and density dependent pairing. To evaluate statistical errors and
their budget, we employ the statistical covariance technique. Results: We find
that the errors on neutron skin increase with neutron excess. Statistical
errors due to uncertain coupling constants of the density functional are found
to be larger than systematic errors, the latter not exceeding 0.06 fm in most
neutron-rich nuclei across the nuclear landscape. The single major source of
uncertainty is the poorly determined slope L of the symmetry energy that
parametrizes its density dependence. Conclusions: To provide essential
constraints on the symmetry energy of the nuclear energy density functional,
next-generation measurements of neutron skins are required to deliver precision
better than 0.06 fm.

private interests: pollution, depletion of natural resources, and intergroup
conflicts, are at their core social dilemmas.
  Because of their multidisciplinarity and their importance, social dilemmas
have been studied by economists, biologists, psychologists, sociologists, and
political scientists. These studies typically explain tendency to cooperation
by dividing people in proself and prosocial types, or appealing to forms of
external control or, in iterated social dilemmas, to long-term strategies.
  But recent experiments have shown that cooperation is possible even in
one-shot social dilemmas without forms of external control and the rate of
cooperation typically depends on the payoffs. This makes impossible a
predictive division between proself and prosocial people and proves that people
have attitude to cooperation by nature.
  The key innovation of this article is in fact to postulate that humans have
attitude to cooperation by nature and consequently they do not act a priori as
single agents, as assumed by standard economic models, but they forecast how a
social dilemma would evolve if they formed coalitions and then they act
according to their most optimistic forecast. Formalizing this idea we propose
the first predictive model of human cooperation able to organize a number of
different experimental findings that are not explained by the standard model.
We show also that the model makes satisfactorily accurate quantitative
predictions of population average behavior in one-shot social dilemmas.

Breaker fixes an arbitrary tournament T_k on k vertices. Maker wins if, at the
end of the game, her digraph contains a copy of T_k; otherwise Breaker wins. In
our main result, we show that Maker has a winning strategy for k =
(2-o(1))log_2 n, improving the constant factor in previous results of Beck and
the second author. This is asymptotically tight since it is known that for k =
(2-o(1))log_2 n Breaker can prevent that the underlying graph of Maker's graph
contains a k-clique. Moreover the precise value of our lower bound differs from
the upper bound only by an additive constant of 12.
  We also discuss the question whether the random graph intuition, which
suggests that the threshold for k is asymptotically the same for the game
played by two ""clever"" players and the game played by two ""random"" players, is
supported by the tournament game: It will turn out that, while a
straightforward application of this intuition fails, a more subtle version of
it is still valid.
  Finally, we consider the orientation-game version of the tournament game,
where Maker wins the game if the final digraph -- containing also the edges
directed by Breaker -- possesses a copy of T_k. We prove that in that game
Breaker has a winning strategy for k = (4+o(1))log_2 n.

velocity distributions of the absorbing gas and its ionization status. We
collected 23 photometrical and spectro-photometrical observations at the 1.82m
Telescope of the Asiago Observatory since 2003, plus other 5 spectra from the
literature. We analysed the evolution in time of the equivalent width of the
broad absorption feature and two narrow absorption systems, the correlation
among them and with the R band magnitude. We performed a structure function
analysis of the equivalent width variations. We present an unprecedented
monitoring of a broad absorption line quasar based on 28 epochs in 14 years.
The shape of broad absorption feature shows a relative stability, while its
equivalent width slowly declines until it sharply increases during 2011. In the
same time the R magnitude stays almost constant until it sharply increases
during 2011. The equivalent width of the narrow absorption redwards of the
systemic redshift only shows a decline. The broad absorption behaviour suggests
changes of the ionisation status as the main cause of variability. We show for
the first time a correlation of this variability with the R band flux. The
different behaviour of the narrow absorption system might be due to
recombination time delay. The structure function of the absorption variability
has a slope comparable with typical optical variability of quasars. This is
consistent with variations of the 200 A ionising flux originating in the inner
part of the accretion disk.

radiation in a very short timescale of a few seconds and with a very narrow
opening angle. Although, all GRBs observed so far are extragalactic in origin,
there is a high probability of a GRB of galactic origin beaming towards the
Earth in the past ~ 0.5 Gyr. Such an intense burst of gamma rays would ionize
the atmosphere and deplete the ozone layer. With depleted ozone, there will be
an increased flux of solar UVB on the Earth's surface with harmful biological
effects. In addition to the atmospheric damage, secondary particles produced by
gamma ray-induced showers will reach the surface. Amongst all secondary
particles, muons dominate the ground-level secondary particle flux (99% of the
total number of particles) and are potentially of biological significance.
Using the Monte Carlo simulation code CORSIKA, we modeled the air showers
produced by gamma ray primaries up to 100 GeV. We found that the number of
muons produced by hypothetical galactic GRBs significantly increases the total
muon flux. However, since the muon production efficiency is extremely low for
photon energy below 100 GeV, and because GRBs radiate strongly for only a very
short time, we find that the biological radiation dose from secondary muons is
negligible. The main mechanism of biological damage from GRBs is through solar
UVB irradiation from the loss of ozone in the upper atmosphere.

  Polylogarithmically Many Vertices",,,,,"cs.DS cs.CG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Maximum Weight Independent Set of Polygons problem is a fundamental
problem in computational geometry. Given a set of weighted polygons in the
2-dimensional plane, the goal is to find a set of pairwise non-overlapping
polygons with maximum total weight. Due to its wide range of applications, the
MWISP problem and its special cases have been extensively studied both in the
approximation algorithms and the computational geometry community. Despite a
lot of research, its general case is not well-understood. Currently the best
known polynomial time algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of n^(epsilon)
[Fox and Pach, SODA 2011], and it is not even clear whether the problem is
APX-hard. We present a (1+epsilon)-approximation algorithm, assuming that each
polygon in the input has at most a polylogarithmic number of vertices. Our
algorithm has quasi-polynomial running time.
  We use a recently introduced framework for approximating maximum weight
independent set in geometric intersection graphs. The framework has been used
to construct a QPTAS in the much simpler case of axis-parallel rectangles. We
extend it in two ways, to adapt it to our much more general setting. First, we
show that its technical core can be reduced to the case when all input polygons
are triangles. Secondly, we replace its key technical ingredient which is a
method to partition the plane using only few edges such that the objects
stemming from the optimal solution are evenly distributed among the resulting
faces and each object is intersected only a few times. Our new procedure for
this task is not more complex than the original one, and it can handle the
arising difficulties due to the arbitrary angles of the polygons. Note that
already this obstacle makes the known analysis for the above framework fail.
Also, in general it is not well understood how to handle this difficulty by
efficient approximation algorithms.

(bilevel) network design problem, CNDP for short. We are given a graph for
which the latency of each edge depends on the ratio of the edge flow and the
capacity installed. The goal is to find an optimal investment in edge
capacities so as to minimize the sum of the routing cost of the induced Wardrop
equilibrium and the investment cost. While this problem is considered as
challenging in the literature, its complexity status was still unknown. We
close this gap showing that CNDP is strongly NP-complete and APX-hard, both on
directed and undirected networks and even for instances with affine latencies.
  As for the approximation of the problem, we first provide a detailed analysis
for a heuristic studied by Marcotte for the special case of monomial latency
functions (Mathematical Programming, Vol.~34, 1986). Specifically, we derive a
closed form expression of its approximation guarantee for arbitrary sets S of
allowed latency functions. Second, we propose a different approximation
algorithm and show that it has the same approximation guarantee. As our final
-- and arguably most interesting -- result regarding approximation, we show
that using the better of the two approximation algorithms results in a strictly
improved approximation guarantee for which we give a closed form expression.
For affine latencies, e.g., this algorithm achieves a 1.195-approximation which
improves on the 5/4 that has been shown before by Marcotte. We finally discuss
the case of hard budget constraints on the capacity investment.

model comparison. Here we deal with their criticisms one by one, and show that
they are largely misplaced, leaving our conclusions unaffected. The bottom line
is that although one can get a periodic model at some period to fit the
extinction data, there are other models which explain the data better.

solving the multi-mode coupled nonlinear Schroedinger equations. We present
highly efficient conversion of the LP 01 - into the LP 11 -mode preserving the
pulse shape in contrast to previous results in step-index fibers. Furthermore,
mode conversion using different wavelengths for inducing and probing the LPG is
shown. Due to the flat phase-matching curve of the examined modes in the
graded-index fiber, mode-conversion can be observed for probe center
wavelengths of 1100nm up to 1800nm with a write beam centered around 1030nm.
Therefore, a complete separation of the probe from the write beam should be
possible as well as the application of optically induced guided mode conversion
for all optical modulation across a broad wavelength range.

mirrors that has been developed in the Institute of Nuclear Physics PAS in
Krakow, Poland. An open-structure composite mirror consists of a rigid flat
sandwich support structure and cast-in-mould spherical epoxy resin layer. To
this layer a thin glass sheet complete with optical coating is cold-slumped to
provide the spherical reflective layer of the mirror. The main components of
the sandwich support structure are two flat float glass panels inter spaced
with V-shape aluminum spacers of equal length. The sandwich support structure
is open, thus enabling good cooling and ventilation of the mirror. A special
arrangement of the aluminum spacers also prohibits water being trapped inside.
The open-structure technology thus represents a novel cost-efficient approach
that does not require the perfect sealing needed in closed-type mirrors. In
addition, the technology enables the application of a dielectric coating.
Full-size prototype mirrors designed for the medium-size CTA telescope will be
presented together with the results of recent optical tests.

causing significant alterations of the disk morphology. Spiral waves due to the
companion tidal force also develop in the vertical direction and affect the
disk temperature profile. These effects may significantly influence the process
of planet formation. We perform 3D numerical simulations of disks in binaries
with different initial dynamical configurations and physical parameters. Our
goal is to investigate their evolution and their propensity to grow planets. We
use an improved version of the SPH code VINE modified to better account for
momentum and energy conservation. The energy equation includes a flux--limited
radiative transfer algorithm and the disk cooling is obtained via ""boundary
particles"". We model a system made of star/disk + star/disk where the secondary
star (and relative disk) is less massive than the primary. The numerical
simulations performed for different values of binary separation and disk
density show that the disk morphology is substantially affected by the
companion perturbations. Trailing spiral shock waves develop when the stars
approach their pericenter. Strong hydraulic jumps occur at the shock front
creating breaking waves and a consistent mass stream between the two disks,
significantly heating them. The high gas temperature may prevent the ice
condensation by moving outward the ""snow line"". The hydraulic jumps may slow
down or even halt the dust coagulation process. At apocenter these
perturbations are reduced and the disks are cooled down and less eccentric. The
strength of the hydraulic jumps, disk heating, and mass exchange depends on the
binary separation, and for larger semi-major axes, the tidal spiral pattern is
substantially reduced.

traveling repairman problem (TRP) in the Euclidean plane and on weighted trees.
This improves on the known quasi-polynomial time approximation schemes for
these problems. The algorithm is based on a simple technique that reduces the
TRP to what we call the \emph{segmented TSP}. Here, we are given numbers
$l_1,\dots,l_K$ and $n_1,\dots,n_K$ and we need to find a path that visits at
least $n_h$ points within path distance $l_h$ from the starting point for all
$h\in\{1,\dots,K\}$. A solution is $\alpha$-approximate if at least $n_h$
points are visited within distance $\alpha l_h$. It is shown that any algorithm
that is $\alpha$-approximate for \emph{every constant} $K$ in some metric
space, gives an $\alpha(1+\epsilon)$-approximation for the TRP in the same
metric space. Subsequently, approximation schemes are given for this segmented
TSP problem in the plane and on weighted trees. The segmented TSP with only one
segment ($K=1$) is equivalent to the $k$-TSP for which a
$(2+\epsilon)$-approximation is known for a general metric space. Hence, this
approach through the segmented TSP gives new impulse for improving on the
3.59-approximation for TRP in a general metric space. A similar reduction
applies to many other minimum latency problems. To illustrate the strength of
this approach we apply it to the well-studied scheduling problem of minimizing
total weighted completion time under precedence constraints, $1|prec|\sum
w_{j}C_{j}$, and present a polynomial time approximation scheme for the case of
interval order precedence constraints. This improves on the known
$3/2$-approximation for this problem. Both approximation schemes apply as well
if release dates are added to the problem.

both clusters. In addition, samples of objects showing (H-Ks) excess are found.
Part of these are suggested to be PMS cluster members of lower mass than the
optical candidates. The spatial distribution of these sources, the comparison
to galactic models and to the expected number of contaminating distant red
galaxies, and the spectral energy distribution in particular cases support this
suggestion. According to the results from numerical simulations, the spatial
distributions of members in different mass ranges are interpreted as suggesting
different initial conditions and evolutionary dynamical paths for the clusters.
Berkeley 94 would have formed under supervirial conditions, and followed the
so-called warm collapse model in its evolution, whereas Berkeley 96 would have
formed with a subvirial structure, and would have evolved following a cold
collapse path. Both processes would be able to reproduce the suggested degree
of mass segregation and their spatial distribution by mass range. Finally, the

their relative positions in genomes of different species, reflects fundamental
constraints on natural evolution. We present approaches to infer pairs of
co-localized genes from multiple genomes, describe their organization, and
study their evolutionary history. In bacterial genomes, we thus identify
synteny units, or ""syntons"", which are clusters of proximal genes that
encompass and extend operons. The size distribution of these syntons divide
them into large syntons, which correspond to fundamental macro-molecular
complexes of bacteria, and smaller ones, which display a remarkable exponential
distribution of sizes. This distribution is ""universal"" in two respects: it
holds for vastly different genomes, and for functionally distinct genes.
Similar statistical laws have been reported previously in studies of bacterial
genomes, and generally attributed to purifying selection or neutral processes.
Here, we perform a new analysis based on the concept of parsimony, and find
that the prevailing evolutionary mechanism behind the formation of small
syntons is a selective process of gene aggregation. Altogether, our results
imply a common evolutionary process that selectively shapes the organization

focusing on how the current inner strategies of the information system
(competition, customer satisfaction) once combined with the gossip may affect
the opinions dynamics. A reinforcement effect is particularly evident in the
social network platforms where several and incompatible cultures coexist (e.g,
pro or against the existence of chemical trails and reptilians, the new world
order conspiracy and so forth). We introduce a computational model of opinion
dynamics which accounts for the coexistence of media and gossip as separated
but interdependent mechanisms influencing the opinions evolution. Individuals
may change their opinions under the contemporary pressure of the information
supplied by the media and the opinions of their social contacts. We stress the
effect of the media communication patterns by considering both the simple case
where each medium mimics the behavior of the most successful one (in order to
maximize the audience) and the case where there is polarization and thus
competition among media reported information (in order to preserve and satisfy
their segmented audience). Finally, we first model the information cycle as in
the case of traditional main stream media (i.e, when every medium knows about
the format of all the others) and then, to account for the effect of the
Internet, on more complex connectivity patterns (as in the case of the web
based information). We show that multiple and polarized information sources
lead to stable configurations where several and distant opinions coexist.

presents a challenge to the theory of hierarchical galaxy clustering. The
PAndAS collaboration has identified a particularly thin configuration with
kinematic coherence among companions of M31 and there have been long standing
claims that the dwarf companions to the Milky Way lie in a plane roughly
orthogonal to the disk of our galaxy. This discussion investigates the possible
origins of four Local Group planes: the plane similar, but not identical to
that identified by PAndAS, an adjacent slightly tilted plane, and two planes
near the Milky Way: one with nearer galaxies and the other with more distant
ones. Plausible orbits are found by using a combination of Numerical Action
methods and a backward in time integration procedure. For M31, M33, IC10, and
LeoI, solutions are found that are consistent with measurements of their proper
motions. For galaxies in planes, there must be commonalities in their proper
motions, and this constraint greatly limits the number of physically plausible
solutions. Key to the formation of the planar structures has been the
evacuation of the Local Void and consequent build-up of the Local Sheet, a wall
of this void. Most of the M31 companion galaxies were born in early-forming
filamentary or sheet-like substrata that chased M31 out of the void. M31 is a
moving target because of its attraction toward the Milky Way, and the result
has been alignments stretched toward our galaxy. In the case of the
configuration around the Milky Way, it appears that our galaxy was in a
three-way competition for companions with M31 and Centaurus A. Only those
within a modest band fell our way. The Milky Ways' attraction toward the Virgo
Cluster resulted in alignments along the Milky Way-Virgo Cluster line.

disjunctive normal form constructed at the root of C. We call such t a shift.
The proof shows that t is disjoint from an edge set z whose removal leaves no
k-cliques.
  We explore the set theoretical nature of computation by Boolean circuits. We
develop a theory by finding topological properties of the Hamming space 2^{[n]}
where [n]={1, 2, ..., n}. A structural theorem is presented, which is closely
related to the sunflower lemma and claims a stronger statement in most cases.
The theory lays the foundation of the above shift method. It also shows the
existence of a sunflower with small core in a family of sets, which is not an
obvious consequence of the sunflower lemma.
  Lastly, we point out that the new methodology has potential to apply to a
general circuit computing cliques due to the dynamic selection of t and z, and
to improve the Alon-Boppana bound exp(\Omega(n / \log n)^{1/3})).

emerging from the central association is not sufficient to ionize the entire

are used to evaluate whether these stars can be the energy source for the

set of measurements which leads to solving systems of ill-posed equations. In
this paper we propose the Landweber iteration of Kaczmarz type with general
uniformly convex penalty functional. The method is formulated by using tools
from convex analysis. The penalty term is allowed to be non-smooth to include
the $L^1$ and total variation (TV) like penalty functionals, which are
significant in reconstructing special features of solutions such as sparsity
and piecewise constancy in practical applications. Under reasonable conditions,
we establish the convergence of the method. Finally we present numerical
simulations on tomography problems and parameter identification in partial
differential equations to indicate the performance.

in coherently coupled N-component BECs. We classify all possible N-omers in

lattices without the Rabi coupling known before are connected to the Abrikosov
lattice of integer vortices with increasing the Rabi coupling. In this process,
vortex dimers change their partners in various ways at large couplings. We then
find that the Abrikosov lattices are robust in three-component BECs.

motions from every space-time point. We provide a new state space and topology
for this process and obtain an invariance principle for coalescing random
walks. This result holds under a finite variance assumption and is thus
optimal. In previous works by Fontes et al. [Ann. Probab. 32 (2004) 2857-2883],
Newman et al. [Electron. J. Probab. 10 (2005) 21-60], the topology and
state-space required a moment of order $3-\varepsilon$ for this convergence to
hold. The proof relies crucially on recent work of Schramm and Smirnov on
scaling limits of critical percolation in the plane. Our approach is
sufficiently simple that we can handle substantially more complicated
coalescing flows with little extra work - in particular similar results are
obtained in the case of coalescing Brownian motions on the Sierpinski gasket.
This is the first such result where the limiting paths do not enjoy the
noncrossing property.

the trap. Under this scheme, solitons are sequentially launched from the
different components, and interact with each other through phase-independent
cross-coupling. We obtain an analytical estimation of the critical condition
for soliton emission using a geometric guiding model, in analogy with
integrated optical systems. In addition, we show how strong initial
perturbations in the system can trigger the spontaneous generation of
supersolitons, i.e. localized phonon-like excitations of the soliton trains.
Finally, we demonstrate the controllable generation of slow and fast
supersolitons by adding external localized potentials in the nonlinear region.

molecular clouds, but until recently, attempts to detect interstellar O2 line

multi-line detections of O2 with low abundances in the Orion and rho Oph A
molecular clouds with Herschel, it is important to investigate other
environments, and we here quantify the O2 abundance near a solar-mass
protostar. Observations of O2, at 487 GHz toward a deeply embedded low-mass
Class 0 protostar, NGC 1333-IRAS 4A, are presented, using the HIFI instrument
on the Herschel Space Observatory. Complementary data of the chemically related
NO and CO molecules are obtained as well. The high spectral resolution data are
analysed using radiative transfer models to infer column densities and
abundances, and are tested directly against full gas-grain chemical models. The
deep HIFI spectrum fails to show O2 at the velocity of the dense protostellar
envelope, implying one of the lowest abundance upper limits of O2/H2 at
<6x10^-9 (3 sigma). However, a tentative (4.5 sigma) detection of O2 is seen at
the velocity of the surrounding NGC 1333 molecular cloud, shifted by 1 km/s
relative to the protostar. For the protostellar envelope, pure gas-phase models
and gas-grain chemical models require a long pre-collapse phase (~0.7-1x10^6
years), during which atomic and molecular oxygen are frozen out onto dust
grains and fully converted to H2O, to avoid overproduction of O2 in the dense
envelope. The same model also reproduces the limits on the chemically related
NO molecule. The tentative detection of O2 in the surrounding cloud is
consistent with a low-density PDR model with small changes in reaction rates.
The low O2 abundance in the collapsing envelope around a low-mass protostar
suggests that the gas and ice entering protoplanetary disks is very poor in O2.

holes in a super-Eddington state, little is yet established of the physics of
this accretion mode. Here, we use a combined X-ray spectral and timing analysis
of a sample of ULXs to investigate this new accretion regime. We suggest a
spectral classification scheme that separates ULXs into three classes: a
broadened disc class, and two-component hard and soft ultraluminous regimes. At
the lowest luminosities the ULX population is dominated by sources with
broadened disc spectra, whilst two component spectra are seen at higher
luminosities, suggestive of a distinction between ~ Eddington and
super-Eddington accretion modes. We find high levels of variability are limited
to ULXs with soft ultraluminous spectra, and a few broadened disc sources.
Furthermore, the variability is strongest at high energies, suggesting it
originates in the harder spectral component. These properties are consistent
with current models of super-Eddington emission, where a wind forms a funnel
around the central regions of the accretion flow. As the wind provides the soft
component this suggests that inclination is the key determinant in the observed
X-ray spectra, which is very strongly supported by the variability results if
this originates due to clumpy material at the edge of the wind intermittently
obscuring our line-of-sight to the central regions of the ULX. The pattern of
spectral variability with luminosity in two ULXs that straddle the hard/soft
ultraluminous regime boundary is consistent with the wind increasing at higher
accretion rates, and thus narrowing the opening angle of the funnel. Hence,
this work suggests that most ULXs can be explained as stellar-mass black holes
accreting at and above the Eddington limit, with their observed characteristics
dominated by two variables: accretion rate and inclination. (abridged)

area functions and comparing the predictions with AIA observations. For most
channels, the AIA intensities summed over the disk agree with the corresponding
measurements derived from the current Version (V2) of the EVE data to within
the estimated 25% calibration error. This agreement indicates that the AIA
effective areas are generally stable in time. The AIA 304 \AA\ channel,
however, does show degradation by a factor of almost 3 from May 2010 through
September 2011, when the throughput apparently reached a minimum. We also find
some inconsistencies in the 335 \AA\ passband, possibly due to higher-order
contamination of the EVE data. The intensities in the AIA 193 \AA\ channel
agree to within the uncertainties with the corresponding measurements from EIS
full CCD observations. Analysis of high-resolution X-ray spectra of the
solar-like corona of Procyon, and of EVE spectra, allows us to investigate the
accuracy and completeness of the CHIANTI database in the AIA shorter wavelength
passbands. We find that in the 94 \AA\ channel, the spectral model
significantly underestimates the plasma emission owing to a multitude of
missing lines. We derive an empirical correction for the AIA temperature
responses by performing differential emission measure (DEM) inversion on a
broad set of EVE spectra and adjusting the AIA response functions so that the
count rates predicted by the full-disk DEMs match the observations.

  gene expression data","18 pages",,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: Inference of gene regulatory networks from transcriptomic data
has been a wide research area in recent years. Proposed methods are mainly
based on the use of graphical Gaussian models for observational wild-type data
and provide undirected graphs that are not able to accurately highlight the
causal relationships among genes. In the present work, we seek to improve
estimation of causal effects among genes by jointly modeling observational
transcriptomic data with intervention data obtained by performing knock-outs or
knock-downs on a subset of genes. By examining the impact of such expression
perturbations on other genes, a more accurate reflection of regulatory
relationships may be obtained than through the use of wild-type data alone.
Results: Using the framework of Gaussian Bayesian networks, we propose a Markov
chain Monte Carlo algorithm with a Mallows model and an analytical likelihood
maximization to sample from the posterior distribution of causal node
orderings, and in turn, to estimate causal effects. The main advantage of the
proposed algorithm over previously proposed methods is that it has the
flexibility to accommodate any kind of intervention design, including partial
or multiple knock-out experiments. Methods were compared on simulated data as
well as data from the DREAM 2007 challenge. Conclusions: The simulation study
confirmed the impossibility of estimating causal orderings of genes with
observation data only. The proposed algorithm was found, in most cases, to
perform better than the previously proposed methods in terms of accuracy for
the estimation of causal effects. In addition, multiple knock-outs proved to
bring valuable additional information compared to single knock-outs. The choice
of optimal intervention design therefore appears to be a crucial aspect for
causal inference and an interesting challenge for future research.

these latter systems are referred to here as Sirius-Like. There are currently
98 known Sirius-Like systems. Studies of the local white dwarf population

algorithms that obey few or no such constraints. We consider an intermediate
alternative in which algorithms optimistically assume that conflicts are
unlikely and if conflicts do arise a conflict-resolution protocol is invoked.
We view this ""optimistic concurrency control"" paradigm as particularly
appropriate for large-scale machine learning algorithms, particularly in the
unsupervised setting. We demonstrate our approach in three problem areas:
clustering, feature learning and online facility location. We evaluate our
methods via large-scale experiments in a cluster computing environment.

cosmological parameters much more stringent than those possible with any
individual probe. We examine the combination of two highly correlated probes of
late-time structure growth: (i) weak gravitational lensing from a survey with
photometric redshifts and (ii) galaxy clustering and redshift space distortions
from a survey with spectroscopic redshifts. We choose generic survey designs so
that our results are applicable to a range of current and future photometric
redshift (e.g. KiDS, DES, HSC, Euclid) and spectroscopic redshift (e.g. DESI,
4MOST, Sumire) surveys. Combining the surveys greatly improves their power to
measure both dark energy and modified gravity. An independent, non-overlapping
combination sees a dark energy figure of merit more than 4 times larger than
that produced by either survey alone. The powerful synergies between the
surveys are strongest for modified gravity, where their constraints are
orthogonal, producing a non-overlapping joint figure of merit nearly 2 orders
of magnitude larger than either alone. Our projected angular power spectrum
formalism makes it easy to model the cross-correlation observable when the
surveys overlap on the sky, producing a joint data vector and full covariance
matrix. We calculate a same-sky improvement factor, from the inclusion of these
cross-correlations, relative to non-overlapping surveys. We find nearly a
factor of 4 for dark energy and more than a factor of 2 for modified gravity.
The exact forecast figures of merit and same-sky benefits can be radically
affected by a range of forecasts assumption, which we explore methodically in a
sensitivity analysis. We show that that our fiducial assumptions produce robust
results which give a good average picture of the science return from combining
photometric and spectroscopic surveys.

Louisiana-Texas shelf contribute to an annually recurring, short-lived hypoxic
bottom layer in areas of the northern Gulf of Mexico comprising less than 2% of
the total Gulf of Mexico bottom area. This paper observes that the NOAA and
LUMCON have now published errant predictions of possible record size areas of
temporary bottom water hypoxia (""dead zones"") three times since 2005, in 2008,
2011, and 2013 and that the LUMCON predictions of the area of hypoxic bottom
water average 31% higher than the actual measured hypoxic areas from 2006 to
2014. These systematically high predictions depend on the assumption that the
susceptibility of the Gulf of Mexico to forming hypoxic areas in response to
nutrient loading has been relatively constant since 2001, though the
susceptibility has been occasionally adjusted upward in different models. It
has been previously suggested that tropical storms in a given year that occur
on the Louisiana-Texas shelf between the peak nutrient loading in spring and
formation of the hypoxic zone in summer can mitigate the size of the hypoxic
zone that year through mixing of stratified well oxygenated lighter and warmer
surface layers and oxygen depleted heavier and cooler bottom layers. This paper
suggests several reasons why the Louisiana-Texas shelf may be systematically
growing less susceptible to a given level of nutrient loading over time so that
predictions based on the measured area of temporary bottom water hypoxia prior
to 2006 tend to be too big in recent years.

support non-Abelian excitations from which protected quantum gates can be
designed. However, there is no experimental evidence for these non-Abelian
anyons to date. In this paper, we study the $\nu=2/k$ FQH-superconductor
heterostructure and find the superconducting analogue of the $Z_k$ parafermion
FQH state. Our main tool is the mapping of the FQH into coupled one-dimensional
(1D) chains each with a pair of counter-propagating modes. We show that by
inducing intra-chain pairing and charge preserving backscattering with
identical couplings, the 1D chains flow into gapless $Z_{k}$ parafermions when
$k< 4$. By studying the effect of inter-chain coupling, we show that every
parafermion mode becomes massive except for the two outermost ones. Thus, we
achieve a fractional topological superconductor whose chiral edge state is
described by a $Z_k$ parafermion conformal field theory. For instance, we find
that a $\nu=2/3$ FQH in proximity to a superconductor produces a $Z_3$
parafermion superconducting state. This state is topologically
indistinguishable from the non-Abelian part of the $\nu=12/5$ Read-Rezay state.
Both of these systems can host Fibonacci anyons capable of performing universal
quantum computation through braiding operations.

are consistent with previous evidence of a Mach 1.46 shock 100"" from the
cluster center, although there is still no convincing evidence for the expected
temperature jump. Other interpretations of this feature are possible, but none
is fully satisfactory. Large scale asymmetries, including enhanced X-ray
emission 200"" southwest of the cluster center and a plume of low entropy,
enriched gas reaching 50"" to the north of the center, are signatures of gas
sloshing induced by core passage of a merging subcluster about 400 Myr ago. An
association between the unusual radio ridge and low entropy gas are consistent
with this feature being the remnant of a former radio jet that was swept away
from the AGN by gas sloshing. A large discrepancy between the energy required
to produce the 100"" shock and the enthalpy of the outer radio lobes of 3C 338
suggests that the lobes were formed by a more recent, less powerful radio
outburst. Lack of evidence for shocks in the central 10"" indicates that the
power of the jet now is some two orders of magnitude smaller than when the 100""

that wave absorption can take place at the corotation resonance, where the

derive the general relativistic expression for the disc vortensity (vorticity
divided by surface density), which governs the behaviour of density
perturbation near corotation. Depending on the gradient of the generalized disc
vortensity, corotational wave absorption can lead to the amplification or
damping of the spiral wave. We apply our general theory of relativistic wave
dynamics to calculate the non-axisymmetric inertial-acoustic modes (also called
p-modes) trapped in the inner-most region of a black hole accretion disc.
Because general relativity changes the profiles of the radial epicyclic
frequency and disc vortensity near the inner disc edge close to the black hole,
these p-modes can become overstable under appropriate conditions. We present
the numerical results of the frequencies and growth rates of p-modes for
various black hole spin and model disc parameters (the surface density profile

storage cloud and limited chunking (i.e., dividing the object into a few

uploading and downloading data in and out of cloud storage.
  TOFEC is a strategy that helps front-end proxy adapt to level of workload by
treating scalable cloud storage (e.g. Amazon S3) as a shared resource requiring
admission control. Under light workloads, TOFEC creates more smaller chunks and
uses more parallel connections per file, minimizing service delay. Under heavy
workloads, TOFEC automatically reduces the level of chunking (fewer chunks with
increased size) and uses fewer parallel connections to reduce overhead,
resulting in higher throughput and preventing queueing delay. Our trace-driven
simulation results show that TOFEC's adaptation mechanism converges to an
appropriate code that provides the optimal delay-throughput trade-off without
reducing system capacity. Compared to a non-adaptive strategy optimized for
throughput, TOFEC delivers 2.5x lower latency under light workloads; compared
to a non-adaptive strategy optimized for latency, TOFEC can scale to support
over 3x as many requests.

black holes with nearly extremal angular momenta. We first discuss in greater
detail the two distinct types of quasinormal mode frequencies presented in a
recent paper (arXiv:1212.3271). One set of modes, that we call ""zero-damping
modes"", has vanishing imaginary part in the extremal limit, and exists for all
corotating perturbations (i.e., modes with azimuthal index m being
nonnegative). The other set (the ""damped modes"") retains a finite decay rate
even for extremal Kerr black holes, and exists only for a subset of corotating
modes. As the angular momentum approaches its extremal value, the frequency
spectrum bifurcates into these two distinct branches when both types of modes
are present. We discuss the physical reason for the mode branching by
developing and using a bound-state formulation for the perturbations of generic
Kerr black holes. We also numerically explore the specific case of the
fundamental l=2 modes, which have the greatest astrophysical interest. Using
the results of these investigations, we compute the quasinormal mode response
of a nearly extremal Kerr black hole to perturbations. We show that many
superimposed overtones result in a slow power-law decay of the quasinormal
ringing at early times, which later gives way to exponential decay. This
exceptional early-time power-law decay implies that the ringdown phase is
long-lived for black holes with large angular momentum, which could provide a
promising strong source for gravitational-wave detectors.

the class of events coming from neutrino interactions with two nucleons
producing two holes (2p2h), limiting the calculation to three-momentum
transfers less than 1.2 GeV produces a two dimensional distribution in momentum
and energy transfer that is roughly constant as a function of energy. The cross
section for 2p2h interactions scales with the number of nucleons for isoscalar

momentum transfers below 1.2 GeV, the cross section is 26% of the QE cross

symmetry of the standard model of particle physics and the primordial
large-scale structure of the universe, we use our recent formulation of the
Weyl-invariant version of the standard model coupled to gravity to track the
evolution of the Higgs in a regularly bouncing cosmology. We find a band of
solutions in which the Higgs field escapes from the metastable phase during
each big crunch, passes through the bang into an expanding phase, and returns
to the metastable vacuum, cycle after cycle after cycle. We show that, due to
the effect of the Higgs, the infinitely cycling universe is geodesically

unattenuated with a characteristic luminosity L_X ~ 1e43-1e45 erg/s. This
""ionization break-out"" may explain the luminous X-ray emission observed from
the transient SCP 06F, providing direct evidence that this SLSN was indeed
engine-powered. Luminous break-out requires a low ejecta mass and that the
spin-down time of the pulsar be comparable to the photon diffusion timescale at
optical maximum, the latter condition similar to that required for a supernova
with a high optical fluence. These relatively special requirements may explain
why most SLSNe-I are not accompanied by detectable X-ray emission. Global
asymmetry of the supernova ejecta increases the likelihood of an early
break-out along the direction of lowest density. Atomic states with lower
threshold energies are more readily ionized at earlier times near optical
maximum, allowing UV break-out across a wider range of pulsar and ejecta
properties than X-ray break-out, possibly contributing to the blue/UV colors of
SLSNe-I.

the accuracy of these general-purpose potential expansions and show that they

from an N-body simulation), for instance, for the purpose of orbit analysis of
the snapshot. For the variants of Schwarzschild modelling, we use two test

demonstrate that all modelling approaches are capable of creating equilibrium

photospheric parameters of the stars we derive their position on the HRD, and
the age given by evolutionary models. Together with other age indicators like
the lithium equivalent width we estimate with high accuracy the age of the

typical population of the ONC. Our results show that, while photometric
determination of the photospheric parameters are an accurate method to estimate
the parameters of the bulk of young stellar populations, those of individual
objects with high accretion rates and extinction may be affected by large

confirm the nature of individual objects. Our analysis shows that this method
allows us to obtain an accurate determination of the photospheric parameters of
accreting YSOs in any nearby star-forming region. We suggest that our detailed,

ratios 1<P2/P1<2, we study the long-term stability of packed two planet
systems. The Hamiltonian for two massive planets on nearly circular and nearly
coplanar orbits near a first order mean motion resonance can be reduced to a
one degree of freedom problem (Sessin & Ferraz Mello (1984), Wisdom (1986),
Henrard et al. (1986)). Using this analytically tractable Hamiltonian, we apply
the resonance overlap criterion to predict the onset of large scale chaotic
motion in close two planet systems. The reduced Hamiltonian has only a weak
dependence on the planetary mass ratio, and hence the overlap criterion is
independent of the planetary mass ratio at lowest order. Numerical integrations
confirm that the planetary mass ratio has little effect on the structure of the
chaotic phase space for close orbits in the low eccentricity (e <~0.1) regime.
We show numerically that orbits in the chaotic web produced primarily by first
order resonance overlap eventually experience large scale erratic variation in
semimajor axes and are Lagrange unstable. This is also true of the orbits in
this overlap region which are Hill stable. As a result, we can use the first
order resonance overlap criterion as an effective stability criterion for pairs
of observed planets. We show that for low mass (<~10 M_Earth) planetary systems
with initially circular orbits the period ratio at which complete overlap
occurs and widespread chaos results lies in a region of parameter space which
is Hill stable. Our work indicates that a resonance overlap criterion which
would apply for initially eccentric orbits needs to take into account second
order resonances. Finally, we address the connection found in previous work
between the Hill stability criterion and numerically determined Lagrange
instability boundaries in the context of resonance overlap.

around M dwarfs, such as HPF, CARMENES, and TESS. Multiple epochs of radial

imaging of a subset of stars enables the detection of possible stellar
companions at larger separations. The high-resolution H-band APOGEE spectra

known spectroscopic vsini values for M dwarfs. Furthermore, by modeling
telluric lines to correct for small instrumental radial velocity shifts, we

be solved by assuming that the supernova remnant (SNR) shock initially moved
through a stellar wind bubble, but is currently evolving in the uniform
interstellar medium with a relatively low density.
  We investigate this scenario by combining hydrodynamical simulations of the
wind-loss phase and the supernova remnant evolution with a coupled X-ray
emission model, which includes non-equilibrium ionization. For the explosion
models we use the well-known W7 deflagration model and the delayed detonation
model that was previously shown to provide good fits to the X-ray emission of
Tycho's SNR.
  Our simulations confirm that a uniform ambient density cannot simultaneously
reproduce the dynamical and X-ray emission properties of Tycho. In contrast,
models that considered that the remnant was evolving in a dense, but small,
wind bubble reproduce reasonably well both the measured X-ray emission spectrum
and the expansion parameter of Tycho's SNR. Finally, we discuss possible mass
loss scenarios in the context of single- and double-degenerate models which
possible could form such a small dense wind bubble.

dispersions) for 30 nearly face-on spiral galaxies out to as much as three disk
scale lengths (h_R). These data have been derived from PPak IFU spectroscopy
(4980-5370A), observed at a mean resolution of R=7700 (sigma_inst=17km/s).
These data are a fundamental product of our survey and will be used in
companion papers to, e.g., derive the detailed (baryonic+dark) mass budget of
each galaxy in our sample. Our presentation provides a comprehensive
description of the observing strategy, data reduction, and analysis. Along with
a clear presentation of the data, we demonstrate: (1) The OIII and stellar
rotation curves exhibit a clear signature of asymmetric drift with a rotation
difference that is 11% of the maximum rotation speed of the galaxy disk,
comparable to measurements in the solar neighborhood in the Milky Way. (2) The
e-folding length of the stellar velocity dispersion is two times h_R on
average, as expected for a disk with a constant scale height and mass-to-light
ratio, with a scatter that is notably smaller for massive,
high-surface-brightness disks in the most luminous galaxies. (3) At radii
larger than 1.5 h_R, the stellar velocity dispersion tends to decline slower
than the best-fitting exponential function, which may be due to an increase in
the disk mass-to-light ratio, disk flaring, or disk heating by the dark-matter
halo. (4) A strong correlation exists between the central vertical stellar
velocity dispersion of the disks and their circular rotational speed at 2.2
h_R, with a zero point indicating that galaxy disks are submaximal. Moreover,
weak but consistent correlations exist such that disks with a fainter central
surface brightness in bluer and less luminous galaxies of later morphological
types are kinematically colder with respect to their rotational velocities.

quantum impurity problems in d-dimensional lattices. This approach is based on
a canonical transformation, of the Lanczos form, where the complete lattice
Hamiltonian is exactly mapped onto an equivalent one dimensional system, in the
same spirit as Wilson's numerical renormalization. The method is particularly
suited to study systems that are inhomogeneous, and/or have a boundary. As a
proof of concept, we use the density matrix renormalization group to solve the
equivalent one-dimensional problem. The resulting dimensional reduction
translates into a reduction of the scaling of the entanglement entropy by a
factor $L^{d-1}$, where L is the linear dimension of the original d-dimensional
lattice. This allows one to calculate the ground state of a magnetic impurity
attached to an LxL square lattice and an LxLxL cubic lattice with L up to 140
sites. We also study the localized edge states in graphene nanoribbons by
attaching a magnetic impurity to the edge or the center of the system. For
armchair metallic nanoribbons we find a slow decay of the spin correlations as
a consequence of the delocalized metallic states. In the case of zigzag
ribbons, the decay of the spin correlations depends on the position of the
impurity. If the impurity is situated in the bulk of the ribbon, the decay is
slow as in the metallic case. On the other hand, if the adatom is attached to
the edge, the decay is fast, within few sites of the impurity, as a consequence
of the localized edge states, and the short correlation length. The mapping can
be combined with ab-initio band structure calculations to model the system, and
to understand correlation effects in quantum impurity problems from first
principles.

viral escape from cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTLs) response. Typically, the first
such CTL escape occurs in a matter of days, starting around the time of peak
viral load. Many authors have developed methods to quantify the strength of CTL
response by measuring the rate at which CTL escape occurs, but such methods
usually depend on sampling at two or more timepoints, while many datasets
capture the dynamics of the first CTL escape at only a single timepoint. Here,
we develop inference methods for CTL escape rates applicable to single
timepoint datasets. Through a model of early infection dynamics, we construct
confidence intervals for escape rates, but since early infection dynamics are
not completely understood, we also develop a one-sided confidence interval
serving as a lower bound for escape rates over a collection of early infection
models. We apply our methods to two SIV datasets, using our lower bounds and
existing methods to show that escape rates are relatively high during the
initial days of the first CTL escape and then drop to lower levels as the
escape proceeds. We also compare escape in the lymph nodes and the rectal

conditions have been determined recently. The region of detonation initiation
cannot be spatially resolved in multi-dimensional full-star simulations of the

The probability for a DDT to occur is calculated from the distribution of

recombination causes the CMB anisotropies to be significantly frequency

a strong signal in any future space-based CMB missions. The later peak of the
Rayleigh visibility compared to Thomson scattering gives an increased
large-scale CMB polarization signal that is a greater than 4% effect for
observed frequencies greater than 500GHz. There is a similar magnitude
suppression on small scales from additional damping. Due to strong correlation
between the Rayleigh and primary signal, measurement of the Rayleigh component
is limited by noise and foregrounds, not cosmic variance of the primary CMB,
and should observable over a wide range of angular scales at frequencies
between roughly 200GHz and 800GHz. I give new numerical calculations of the

with an unidentified environment of some other particles whose dissipative
effect is approximated by a diffusion. The environment is described by a time
dependent cosmological term which is compensating the lack of the conservation
law of the energy momentum of the diffusing fluid. We are interested in a
homogeneous flat expanding Universe described by a scale factor $a$. For a
fluid of massless particles at finite temperature we obtain explicit solutions
of the diffusion equation which are in the form of a modified Juttner
distribution with a time dependent temperature. At later time Universe
evolution is described as a diffusion at zero temperature with no
equilibration. We find solutions of the diffusion at zero temperature which can
be treated as a continuation to a later time of the finite temperature
solutions describing an early stage of the Universe. A conservation of the
total energy momentum determines the cosmological term up to a constant. The
resulting energy momentum inserted into Einstein equations gives a modified
Friedmann equation. Solutions of the Friedmann equation depend on the initial
value of the cosmological term. The large value of the cosmological constant
implies an exponential expansion. If the initial conditions allow a power-like
solution for a large time then it must be of the form $a\simeq \tau$ (no
deceleration, $\tau$ is the cosmic time). The final stage of the Universe
evolution is described by a non-relativistic diffusion of a cold dust.

in eta_F cause exponential changes in {\sigma}, but linear changes in S. S

importance in the context of solar and heliophysics. Coronal mass ejections
(CMEs) and coronal waves are energetic manifestations of the restructuring of
the solar magnetic field and mass motion of the plasma. Characterising this
motion is vital for deriving the dynamics of these events and thus
understanding the physics driving their initiation and propagation. The
development and use of appropriate methods for measuring event kinematics is
therefore imperative. Traditional approaches to the study of CME and coronal
wave kinematics do not return wholly accurate nor robust estimates of the true
event kinematics and associated uncertainties. We highlight the drawbacks of
these approaches, and demonstrate improved methods for accurate and reliable
determination of the kinematics. The Savitzky-Golay filter is demonstrated as a
more appropriate fitting technique for CME and coronal wave studies, and a
residual resampling bootstrap technique is demonstrated as a statistically
rigorous method for the determination of kinematic error estimates and
goodness-of-fit tests. It is shown that the scatter on distance-time
measurements of small sample size can significantly limit the ability to derive
accurate and reliable kinematics. This may be overcome by (i) increasing
measurement precision and sampling cadence, and (ii) applying robust methods
for deriving the kinematics and reliably determining their associated
uncertainties. If a priori knowledge exists and a pre-determined model form for
the kinematics is available (or indeed any justified fitting-form to be tested

XBs). We present the recent lightcurves of both ULXs. 1RXH J132519.8-430312

of days. We show that a reasonable upper limit for both duty cycles is 0.2,
with a lower limit of 0.12 for ULX2. This duty cycle is larger than anticipated
for transient ULXs in old stellar populations. By fitting simple spectral
models in an observation with ~50 counts we recover properties consistent with
Galactic BH XBs, but inconclusive as to the spectral state. We utilise quantile
analyses to demonstrate that the spectra are generally soft, and that in one
observation the spectrum of ULX2 is inconsistent with a canonical hard state at
>95% confidence. This is contrary to what would be expected of an accreting
IMBH primary, which we would expect to be in the hard state at these

not by rotation, as normal radio pulsars. They are understood as strongly
magnetized neutron star, with large periods of rotation $P\sim(2-12)$ s, and
large spin-down, with typical $\dot{P}\sim(10^{-13}-10^{-10})$ s/s in contrast
to $\dot{P}\sim10^{-15}$ s for ordinary pulsars. Their persistent X-ray
luminosity, as well as the bursts and flares typical of these sources, are
instead believed to be powered by the decay of their ultrastrong magnetic
field. SGRs/AXPs typically have a larger X-ray luminosity that can not be
explained by their spin-down luminosity ($L_X>\dot{E}_{\rm rot}$), unlike
rotation-powered pulsars. However, the recent discovery of radio-pulsed
emission in four of this class of sources, where the spin-down rotational
energy lost $\dot{E}_{\rm rot}$ is larger than the X-ray luminosity $L_X$
during the quiescent state - as in normal pulsars - opens the question of the
nature of these radio sources in comparison to the others of this class. In
this contribution, we show that the radio SGRs/AXPs obey a linear log-log
relation between $L_X$ and $\dot{E}_{\rm rot}$, very similar to the one
satisfied by X-ray and gamma-ray neutron star pulsars, suggesting their neutron
star nature. Furthermore, we show that almost all the high-B pulsars are also
near the line found for the radio AXPs. In contrast, for almost all the others
SGRs/AXPs, $\log L_X$ does not vary too much as function of $\log \dot{E}_{\rm
rot}$, a phenomenology not shared by X-ray neutron star pulsars, suggesting a
different nature for these sources.

refinement approach to the field of computational fluid dynamics, this article
has studied an iterative interpolation scheme for the construction and
differentiation of a basis function in a two-dimensional mesh that is a finite

discretization error is controlled by the order of the basis function. The
potential of this novel technique has been demonstrated with some
representative examples of the Poisson equation. We have also verified the
technique with a dynamical core of two-dimensional flow in primitive variables.
An excellent result has been observed-on resolving a shear layer and on the

previously reported benchmark simulations. In particular, the shear-driven

at low charge carrier densities in graphene and a strongly sub-linear behavior
of the conductivity at high charge carrier densities when the correlation
distance between the impurities is large. On the other hand, we find that a
super-linear dependence of the conductivity on charge carrier density in
heavily doped graphene may arise from increasing the distance of impurities
from graphene or allowing their clustering, whereas the existence of a electric
dipole impurities may give rise to an electron-hole asymmetry in the
conductivity. We show that finite thickness of a dielectric layer in the top
gating configuration, as well as the existence of non-zero air gap(s) between
graphene and the dielectric(s) exert strong influences on the conductivity and
its minimum. While a decrease in the dielectric thickness is shown to increase
the conductivity in doped graphene and even gives rise to finite conductivity
in neutral graphene for a 2D distribution of impurities. We find that an
increase in the dielectric thickness gives rise to a super-linear behavior of
the conductivity when impurities are homogeneously distributed throughout the
dielectric. Moreover, the dependence of graphene's mobility on its charge
carrier density is surprisingly strongly affected, quantitatively and
qualitatively, by the graphene-dielectric gap(s) when combined with the precise
position of a 2D distribution of charged impurities. Finally, we show the
changes in the conductivity minimum in neutral graphene as the correlation
distance between the impurities and the dielectric thickness is altered.

directly accessible at low energies, can be parameterized by explicit
resonances having certain quantum numbers. The extreme case is the decoupling
limit where those resonances are very heavy and leave only traces in the form
of deviations in the SM couplings. Translations are given into
higher-dimensional operators leading to such deviations. As long as such
resonances are introduced without a UV-complete theory behind it, these models
suffer from unitarity violation of perturbative scattering amplitudes. We show
explicitly how theoretically sane descriptions could be achieved by using a
unitarization prescription that allows a correct description of such a
resonance without specifying a UV-complete model.

of the Higgs diphoton decay mode observed at ATLAS (and CMS), which is
considerably larger than the Standard Model expectation, can be explained by a
simple gauge-Higgs unification model with color-singlet bulk fermions to which
a half-periodic boundary condition is assigned. The bulk fermions with mass at
the TeV scale also play a crucial role in reproducing the observed Higgs boson
mass of around 125 GeV. One naturally expects that the KK modes also contribute
to the effective H-Z-gamma coupling. However, we show a very specific and
general prediction of the gauge-Higgs unification scenario that KK-mode
contributions to the H-Z-gamma coupling do not exist at the 1-loop level. If
the excess of the Higgs to diphoton decay mode persists, its correlation with
the Higgs to Z photon decay mode can be a clue to distinguish scenarios beyond
the SM, providing a significant improvement of the sensitivity for the Higgs
boson signals in the future.

generating and executing possible hacking attacks. Doing so automatically

under incomplete knowledge about the network configuration. Previous work uses
classical planning, and requires costly pre-processes reducing this uncertainty
by extensive application of scanning methods. By contrast, we herein model the
attack planning problem in terms of partially observable Markov decision
processes (POMDP). This allows to reason about the knowledge available, and to
intelligently employ scanning actions as part of the attack. As one would
expect, this accurate solution does not scale. We devise a method that relies
on POMDPs to find good attacks on individual machines, which are then composed
into an attack on the network as a whole. This decomposition exploits network
structure to the extent possible, making targeted approximations (only) where
needed. Evaluating this method on a suitably adapted industrial test suite, we
demonstrate its effectiveness in both runtime and solution quality.

Consequently, these modes have anomalously large mean free paths and can

contrast, the two Goldstone bosons associated with density oscillations of the
neutron and electron + proton fluids, called superfluid phonons, mix and couple
strongly to electrons. They have shorter mean free paths, and their

ground state quantum dynamics to solve optimization problems more rapidly than
is possible classically. Here we develop error correction for quantum annealing
and provide an experimental demonstration using up to 344 superconducting flux
qubits in processors which have recently been shown to physically implement
programmable quantum annealing. We demonstrate a substantial improvement over
the performance of the processors in the absence of error correction. These
results pave a path toward large scale noise-protected adiabatic quantum

substituted Mn atoms form a strongly hybridized ground state.
Resonance-photoemission spectra at the Mn $L_{3}$ edge revealed that the Mn 3d
partial density of states is distributed over a wide energy range of 2-13 eV
below the Fermi level ($E_F$), with little contribution around $E_F$. This
indicates that the dopant Mn 3$d$ states are localized in spite of the strong

due to the on-site Coulomb and exchange interaction. The absence of

photometric methods. Rotation curves are the major tool for determining the
dynamical mass distribution in the Milky Way and spiral galaxies. The
photometric (statistical) method utilizes luminosity profiles from optical and
infrared observations, and assumes empirical values of the mass-to-luminosity
(M/L) ratio to convert the luminosity to mass. In this chapter the dynamical
method is described in detail, and rotation curves and mass distribution in the
Milky Way and nearby spiral galaxies are presented. The dynamical method is
categorized into two methods: the decomposition method and direct method. The
former fits the rotation curve by calculated curve assuming several mass
components such as a bulge, disk and halo, and adjust the dynamical parameters
of each component. Explanations are given of the mass profiles as the de
Vaucouleurs law, exponential disk, and dark halo profiles inferred from
numerical simulations. Another method is the direct method, with which the mass
distribution can be directly calculated from the data of rotation velocities
without employing any mass models. Some results from both methods are
presented, and the Galactic structure is discussed in terms of the mass.
Rotation curves and mass distributions in external galaxies are also discussed,
and the fundamental mass structures are shown to be universal.

correction to the lunar location required to reconcile the anomalous eclipses

moment of inertia due to differential acceleration of land and water that can
account for this discrepancy. We show that 80 percent of these discrepancies
occur when the Moon is at declinations greater than 10 deg and closer to its
major standstill of 28 deg while it spends 46 percent of the time in this

landmass and water using finite element method to account for landmass and
water mass. We show that the results of eclipse error are consistent with the
estimate of a small differential acceleration when the Moon is over land at
high latitudes. However, we encounter some examples where the results from
simulations studies cannot explain the phenomena. Hence we propose that dT
corrections have to be coupled with some other mechanism possibly a small
vertical oscillation in the Moon's rotational plane with a period of the order
of a few hundred years to achieve the required adjustment in the Eclipse maps.

conditions on our results by varying the number of randomly selected ignition
points from 63 to 3500, and the radius of the centered sphere they are confined
in from 128 to 384 km. We find that the rate of nuclear burning depends on the
number of ignition points at early times, the density of ignition points at
intermediate times, and the radius of the confining sphere at late times. The
results depend primarily on the number of ignition points, but we do not expect
this to be the case in general. The simulations with few ignition points
release more nuclear energy $E_{\mathrm{nuc}}$, have larger kinetic energies
$E_{\mathrm{K}}$, and produce more $^{56}$Ni than those with many ignition
points, and differ in the distribution of $^{56}$Ni, Si, and C/O in the ejecta.
For these reasons, the simulations with few ignition points exhibit higher peak
B-band absolute magnitudes $M_\mathrm{B}$ and light curves that rise and
decline more quickly; their $M_\mathrm{B}$ and light curves resemble those of

maximum-hands-off control. A hands-off control is defined as a control that has
a much shorter support than the horizon length. The maximum-hands-off control
is the minimum-support (or sparsest) control among all admissible controls. We
first prove that a solution to an L1-optimal control problem gives a
maximum-hands-off control, and vice versa. This result rationalizes the use of
L1 optimality in computing a maximum-hands-off control. The solution has in
general the ""bang-off-bang"" property, and hence the control may be
discontinuous. We then propose an L1/L2-optimal control to obtain a continuous
hands-off control. Examples are shown to illustrate the effectiveness of the
proposed control method.

The Boltzmann equation is solved numerically after computing the full collision

discrete space of rank two bundles on the projective line: the mass of a given
vector bundle is the number of line bundles whose pushforward it is. In a
sequence of hyperelliptic curves whose genera tend to infinity, these measures
tend to the natural measure on the space of rank two bundles. This is a
function field analogue of Duke's theorem on the equidistribution of Heegner
points, and can be proven similarly: it follows from a manipulation of zeta
functions, plus the Riemann Hypothesis for curves.
  Likewise, a sequence of hyperelliptic curves equipped with line bundles gives
rise to a sequence of measures on the space of pairs of rank 2 bundles. We give
a conjectural classification of the possible limit measures which arise; this
is a function field analogue of the ""Mixing Conjecture"" of Michel and
Venkatesh. As in the number field setting, ergodic theory suffices when the
line bundle is sufficiently special.
  For the remaining bundles, we turn to geometry and count points on
intersections of translates of loci of special divisors in the Jacobian of a
hyperelliptic curve. To prove equidistribution, we would require two results.
The first, we prove: the upper cohomologies of these loci agree with the
cohomology of the Jacobian. The second, which we establish in characteristic
zero and conjecture in characteristic p, is that the sum of the Betti numbers
of these spaces grows at most as the exponential of the genus of the

optical quantum computation, and numerous elementary demonstrations have
recently been performed. Spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) is the
mainstay for single-photon state preparation, the technique employed in most
optical quantum information processing implementations to-date. Here we present
a simple architecture for boson-sampling based on multiplexed SPDC sources and
demonstrate that the architecture is limited only by the post-selection
detection efficiency assuming that other errors, such as spectral impurity,
dark counts, and interferometric instability are negligible. For any given
number of input photons, there exists a minimum detector efficiency that allows
post selection. If this efficiency is achieved, photon-number errors in the
SPDC sources are sufficiently low as to guarantee correct boson-sampling most
of the time. In this scheme the required detector efficiency must increase
exponentially in the photon number. Thus, we show that idealised SPDC sources
will not present a bottleneck for future boson-sampling implementations.
Rather, photodetection efficiency is the limiting factor and thus future
implementations may continue to employ SPDC sources.

may precede some of these drastic events. This view is also corroborated by
abstract mathematical theory for generic bifurcations in stochastic multi-scale

speculative answers can be given. Here, we instead provide a first step towards
tackling this formidable question by focusing on a-priori {\it known} events

fundamental question: Can the stochastic warning signs known from other areas

the observer to determine whether a plasma is in a state of transient
ionization. We use the Atomic Data and Analysis Structure (ADAS) to calculate
line contribution functions for two lines, Si IV 1394 A and O IV 1401 A, formed
in the solar transition region. The generalized collisional-radiative theory is
used. It includes all radiative and electron collisional processes, except for
photon-induced processes. State-resolved direct ionization and recombination to
and from the next ionization stage are also taken into account. For dynamic
bursts with a decay time of a few seconds, the Si IV 1394 A line can be
enhanced by a factor of 2-4 in the first fraction of a second with the peak in
the line contribution function occurring initially at a higher electron
temperature due to transient ionization compared to ionization equilibrium
conditions. On the other hand, the O IV 1401 A does not show such any
enhancement. Thus the ratio of these two lines, which can be observed with the
Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, can be used as a diagnostic of transient
ionization. We show that simultaneous high-cadence observations of two lines
formed in the solar transition region may be used as a direct diagnostic of
whether the observed plasma is in transient ionization. The ratio of these two
lines can change by a factor of four in a few seconds owing to transient
ionization alone.

extragalactic radio sources. Study of the properties of HYbrid MOrphology Radio
Sources (HYMORS) may bring crucial information and lead to a step forward in
understanding the origin of FRI/FRII dichotomy. HYMORS are a rare class of
double-lobed radio sources where each of the two lobes clearly exhibits a
different FR morphology. This article describes follow-up high resolution VLBA
observations of the five discovered by us HYMORS. The main aim of the
observations was to answer the questions of whether the unusual radio
morphology is connected to the orientation of objects towards the observer. We
obtained the high resolution radio maps of five hybrid radio morphology objects
with the VLBA at C-band and L-band. Two of them revealed milliarcsecond
core-jet structures, the next two objects showed hints of parsec-scale jets,
and the last one remained point-like at both frequencies. We compared
properties of observed milliarcsecond structures of hybrid sources with the
larger scale ones previously detected with the VLA. We find that on both scales
the fluxes of their central components are similar, which may indicate the lack
of additional emission in the proximity of the nucleus. This suggests that jets
present on the 1-10 kpc scale in those objects are FRII-like. When possible,
the detected core-jet structures were used for estimating the core's spatial
orientation. The result is that neither the FRI-like nor the FRII-like side is
preferred, which may suggest that no specific spatial orientation of HYMORS is
required to explain their radio morphology. Their estimated viewing angles
indicate they are unbeamed objects. The 178 MHz luminosity of observed HYMORS
exceed the traditional FRI/FRII break luminosity, indicating they have radio
powers similar to FRIIs.

from genomic data, it has proven difficult to distinguish gene flow after
divergence from alternative histories involving structure in the ancestral
population. The lack of a formal test to distinguish these scenarios has
sparked recent controversy about the possibility of interbreeding between
Neandertals and modern humans in Eurasia. We derive the probability of
mutational configurations in non-recombining sequence blocks under alternative
histories of divergence with admixture and ancestral structure. Dividing the
genome into short blocks makes it possible to compute maximum likelihood
estimates of parameters under both models. We apply this method to triplets of
human Neandertal genomes and quantify the relative support for models of
long-term population structure in the ancestral African popuation and admixture
from Neandertals into Eurasian populations after their expansion out of Africa.
Our analysis allows us -- for the first time -- to formally reject a history of
ancestral population structure and instead reveals strong support for admixture
from Neandertals into Eurasian populations at a higher rate (3.4%-7.9%) than
suggested previously.

M. D. Bustamante, U. Hayat ""Complete classification of discrete resonant
Rossby/drift wave triads on periodic domains"", \cite{BH13}, in order to show
that resonance clustering is very sparse and quasi-resonances (that is,
resonances with small enough detuning) play major role in the energy transport
in this specific wave system. On the other hand, in the paper by M. Yamada, T.
Yoneda ""Resonant interaction of Rossby waves in two-dimensional flow on
$\beta$-plane"", \cite{YaYo13}, the same physical system is studied and a
mathematically rigorous theorem is proven: at high $\b$, the flow dynamics is
governed exclusively by resonant interactions. In our present paper we
demonstrate that this seeming contradiction between numerical results
\cite{BH13} and analytical results \cite{YaYo13} are due to some pitfalls in
numerical studies of exact and quasi-resonances presented in \cite{BH13}. We
also demonstrate that resonance clustering of drift waves on periodic
$\b$-plane differs substantially from characteristic resonance clustering in
other 3-wave systems: instead of a usual set of isolated triads and a few
bigger clusters, there exists \emph{no isolated triads} in this case. Resonant

Such data test the calibrations of intensity, wavelength and resolution as well
as the detector response. Smoothing due to resolution, multiple scattering and
polydispersity has been determined. Sources of uncertainty are often related to
systematic deviations and calibrations rather than random counting errors. The
study has prompted development of software to treat modest multiple scattering
and to better model the instrument resolution. These measurements also allow
checks of data reduction algorithms and have identified how they can be
improved. The reproducibility and the reliability of instruments and the
accuracy of parameters derived from the data are described.

quantum transport theories that are required to describe charge and energy
transfer in novel functional nanodevices. Recent work has successfully probed
electric and thermoelectric phenomena in atomic-scale junctions. However, heat
dissipation and transport in atomic-scale devices remain poorly characterized
due to experimental challenges. Here, using custom-fabricated scanning probes
with integrated nanoscale thermocouples, we show that heat dissipation in the
electrodes of molecular junctions, whose transmission characteristics are
strongly dependent on energy, is asymmetric, i.e. unequal and dependent on both
the bias polarity and the identity of majority charge carriers (electrons vs.
holes). In contrast, atomic junctions whose transmission characteristics show
weak energy dependence do not exhibit appreciable asymmetry. Our results
unambiguously relate the electronic transmission characteristics of
atomic-scale junctions to their heat dissipation properties establishing a
framework for understanding heat dissipation in a range of mesoscopic systems
where transport is elastic. We anticipate that the techniques established here
will enable the study of Peltier effects at the atomic scale, a field that has
been barely explored experimentally despite interesting theoretical
predictions. Furthermore, the experimental advances described here are also
expected to enable the study of heat transport in atomic and molecular
junctions, which is an important and challenging scientific and technological

dimensional multiple measurement vectors (MMVs) in resource constrained
distributed networks. We assume that distributed nodes observe sparse signals
which share the same sparsity pattern and each node obtains measurements via a
low dimensional linear operator. When the measurements are collected at
distributed nodes in a communication network, it is often required that joint
sparse recovery be performed under inherent resource constraints such as
communication bandwidth and transmit/processing power.
  We present two approaches to take the communication constraints into account
while performing common sparsity pattern recovery. First, we explore the use of
a shared multiple access channel (MAC) in forwarding observations residing at
each node to a fusion center. With MAC, while the bandwidth requirement does
not depend on the number of nodes, the fusion center has access to only a
linear combination of the observations. We discuss the conditions under which
the common sparsity pattern can be estimated reliably. Second, we develop two
collaborative algorithms based on Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), to jointly
estimate the common sparsity pattern in a decentralized manner with a low
communication overhead. In the proposed algorithms, each node exploits
collaboration among neighboring nodes by sharing a small amount of information
for fusion at different stages in estimating the indices of the true support in
a greedy manner. Efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms are
demonstrated via simulations along with a comparison with the most related
existing algorithms considering the trade-off between the performance gain and
the communication overhead.

The conventional approach to PCA leads to a solution which favours the
structures with large variances. This is sensitive to outliers and could
obfuscate interesting underlying structures. One of the equivalent definitions
of PCA is that it seeks the subspaces that maximize the sum of squared pairwise
distances between data projections. This definition opens up more flexibility
in the analysis of principal components which is useful in enhancing PCA. In
this paper we introduce scales into PCA by maximizing only the sum of pairwise
distances between projections for pairs of datapoints with distances within a
chosen interval of values [l,u]. The resulting principal component
decompositions in Multiscale PCA depend on point (l,u) on the plane and for
each point we define projectors onto principal components. Cluster analysis of
these projectors reveals the structures in the data at various scales. Each
structure is described by the eigenvectors at the medoid point of the cluster
which represent the structure. We also use the distortion of projections as a
criterion for choosing an appropriate scale especially for data with outliers.
This method was tested on both artificial distribution of data and real data.
For data with multiscale structures, the method was able to reveal the
different structures of the data and also to reduce the effect of outliers in
the principal component analysis.

attracted particular interest due to its high gamma-ray fluence, very bright
X-ray afterglow, and the detection of a prompt optical transient and of
long-lasting emission at GeV energies. A follow-up observation carried out with
the XMM-Newton satellite has provided an X-ray spectrum in the 0.3-10 keV with
unprecedented statistics for a GRB afterglow 20 hours after the burst. The
spectrum is well fit by a power-law with photon index 1.87+-0.01, modified by
absorption in our Galaxy and in the GRB host at z=1.4. A Galactic absorption
consistent with that estimated from neutral hydrogen observations is obtained
only with host metallicity lower than 0.05 of the Solar value. We report the
results of a sensitive search for emission and absorption lines using the
matched filter smoothing method (Rutledge and Sako 2003). No statistically
significant lines were found. The upper limits on the equivalent width of
emission lines, derived through Monte Carlo simulations, are few tens of eV, a
factor about 10 lower than that of the possible lines reported in the

$\R^k$ defined by Boolean combinations of polynomial equalities and
inequalities. The focus of this thesis is to study quantitative results in real
algebraic geometry, primarily upper bounds on the topological complexity of
semi-algebraic sets as measured, for example, by their Betti numbers. Another
quantitative measure of topological complexity which we study is the number of
homotopy types of semi-algebraic sets of bounded description complexity. The
description complexity of a semi-algebraic set depends on the context, but it
is simply some measure of the complexity of the polynomials in the formula
defining the semi-algebraic set (e.g., the degree and number of variables of a
polynomial, the so called dense format). We also provide a description of the
Hausdorff limit of a one-parameter family of semi-algebraic sets, up to
homotopy type which the author hopes will find further use in the future.
Finally, in the last chapter of this thesis, we prove a decomposition theorem
similar to the well-known cylindrical decomposition for semi-algebraic sets but
which has the advantage of requiring significantly less cells in the
decomposition. The setting of this last result is not in semi-algebraic
geometry, but in the more general setting of o-minimal structures.

arrays of imaging Cherenkov telescopes. Each telescope comprises a large
reflector, of order 10 m diameter, made of many mirror facets, and a camera
consisting of a matrix of photomultiplier pixels. Differences in the total
throughput between nominally identical telescopes, due to aging of the mirrors
and PMTs and other effects, should be monitored to reduce possible systematic
errors. One way to directly measure the throughput of such telescopes is to
track bright stars and measure the photocurrents produced by their light
falling on camera pixels. We have developed such a procedure using the four
telescopes in the VERITAS array. We note the technique is general, however, and
could be applied to other imaging Cherenkov experiments. For this measurement,
a raster scan is performed on a single star such that its image is swept across
the central pixels in the camera, thus providing a statistically robust set of
measurements in a short period of time to reduce time-dependent effects on the
throughput. Photocurrents are measured using the starlight-induced baseline
fluctuations of the pixel outputs, as recorded by the standard readout
electronics. In this contribution we describe details of the procedure and
report on feasibility studies carried out during the 2012-2013 observing
season.

is the primary measure of the gamma ray's energy so a knowledge of the mirror
reflectivity is important. We describe here a method, pioneered by members of

regularly, so that effects of aging can be monitored. A CCD camera attached
near the centre of the dish simultaneously acquires an image of both a target
star and its reflection on a target of Spectralon, a highly-reflective
material, placed at the focus of the telescope. The ratio of their
brightnesses, as recorded by the CCD, along with geometric factors, provides an
estimate of the dish reflectivity with few systematic errors. A filter wheel is
placed in front of the CCD camera, allowing to measure the reflectivity as a
function of wavelength. We present initial results obtained with the VERITAS

and a conducting plate), an atomic pendulum (Casimir atomic pendulum) is
designed. Using practically acceptable data corresponding to the already known
world of nanotechnology and based on reasonable/reliable numerical estimates,
the period of oscillation for the pendulum is computed. This pendulum can be
considered as both a new Micro (Nano)-Eelectromechanical system and a new
simple vacuum machine. Its design may be considered as a first step towards
realizing the visualized vacuum (Casimir) clock!

wave equations within a shortcut of the Nikiforov-Uvarov method. The solutions
of the radial and polar angular parts of the wave function are expressed in
terms of the Jacobi polynomials. A new approximation being expressed in terms
of the potential parameters is carried out to deal with the strong singular

regenerative turning process. The 3D cutting force components experimentally
measured during stainless steel turning are analyzed, and the parameters of
their stochastic dynamics are estimated. Our analysis shows that the system
initially exhibiting regular vibrations associated with spindle rotation
becomes unstable to high-frequency noisy oscillations (chatter) at larger
cutting depths. We suggest that the chatter may be attributed to frictional
stick-and-slip interactions between the contact surfaces of cutting tool and
workpiece. We compare our findings with previously reported results obtained by
statistical, recurrence, multifractal, and wavelet methods. We discuss the
potential of FNS in monitoring the turning process in manufacturing practice.

levels of abstraction are incrementally refined to the final realizations.
Simulation based techniques have traditionally been used to verify that such
model refinements do not change the design functionality. Unfortunately, with
computer simulations it is not possible to completely check that a design
transformation is correct in a reasonable amount of time, as the number of test
patterns required to do so increase exponentially with the number of system
state variables. In this paper, we propose a methodology for the verification
of conformance of models generated at higher levels of abstraction in the
design process to the design specifications. We model the system behavior using
sequence of recurrence equations. We then use symbolic simulation together with
equivalence checking and property checking techniques for design verification.
Using our proposed method, we have verified the equivalence of three WiMax
system models at different levels of design abstraction, and the correctness of
various system properties on those models. Our symbolic modeling and
verification experiments show that the proposed verification methodology
provides performance advantage over its numerical counterpart.

  2012",,,"physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, the relationship between the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), air
temperature variations and power consumption is evaluated using the linear
regression and Wavelet Coherence (WTC) approach on a 1971-2011 time series for
the United Kingdom (UK). The results based on the linear regression approach
indicate that some 66% variability of the UK electricity demand can be
explained by the quarterly GDP variations, while only 11% of the quarterly
changes of the UK electricity demand are caused by seasonal air temperature
variations. WTC however, can detect the period of time when GDP and air
temperature significantly correlate with electricity demand and the results of
the wavelet correlation at different time scales indicate that a significant
correlation is to be found on a long-term basis for GDP and on an annual basis
for seasonal air-temperature variations. This approach provides an insight into
the properties of the impact of the main factors on power consumption on the
basis of which the power system development or operation planning and
forecasting the power consumption can be improved.

E. Verlinde proposed to interpret the force in Newton s second law and Gravity

(pollen) driven by random impulses from the surrounding molecules, may be the
first example of a stochastic process in which such forces are expected to
emerge. In this note it is shown that at least two types of entropic force can
be identified in the case of 3D Brownian motion (or random walk). This yields
simple derivations of known results of Brownian motion, Hook s law and,
applying an external (non-radial) force, Curie s law and the Langevin-Debye
equation.

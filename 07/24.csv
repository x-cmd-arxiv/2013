fractional Brownian motion and fractional Langevin equation motion, are usually
considered to be ergodic in the sense that, after an algebraic relaxation, time
and ensemble averages of physical observables coincide. Recently it was
demonstrated that fractional Brownian motion and fractional Langevin equation
motion under external confinement are transiently non-ergodic---time and
ensemble averages behave differently---from the moment when the particle starts
to sense the confinement. Here we show that these processes also exhibit
transient ageing, that is, physical observables such as the time averaged mean
squared displacement depend on the time lag between the initiation of the
system at time $t=0$ and the start of the measurement at the ageing time $t_a$.
In particular, it turns out that for fractional Langevin equation motion the
ageing dependence on $t_a$ is different between the cases of free and confined
motion. We obtain explicit analytical expressions for the aged moments of the
particle position as well as the time averaged mean squared displacement and
present a numerical analysis of this transient ageing phenomenon.

Gaussian rewards in a setting where the decision-maker uses Bayesian inference
to estimate the reward values. We model the decision-maker's prior knowledge
with the Bayesian prior on the mean reward. We develop the upper credible limit
(UCL) algorithm for the standard multi-armed bandit problem and show that this
deterministic algorithm achieves logarithmic cumulative expected regret, which
is optimal performance for uninformative priors. We show how good priors and
good assumptions on the correlation structure among arms can greatly enhance
decision-making performance, even over short time horizons. We extend to the
stochastic UCL algorithm and draw several connections to human decision-making
behavior. We present empirical data from human experiments and show that human
performance is efficiently captured by the stochastic UCL algorithm with
appropriate parameters. For the multi-armed bandit problem with transition
costs and the multi-armed bandit problem on graphs, we generalize the UCL
algorithm to the block UCL algorithm and the graphical block UCL algorithm,
respectively. We show that these algorithms also achieve logarithmic cumulative

among arms. We further illustrate the performance of these algorithms with
numerical examples. NB: Appendix G included in this version details minor

$\psi[a/\lambda_{T_c}]$ a non-analytic function such that $\psi[0] = \psi'[0] =

than Hartree-Fock and semiclassical approximations, interaction effecs are
perturbative to second order in $a/\lambda_{T_c}$ and the expected
non-perturbativity of physical quantities at critical temperature appears only
to third order. We compare this finding with different results by other

prove that by considering the limits of the spherical sub-algebras of our new

Zhedanov algebra and prove that each of them (quotiented by their Casimir) is
isomorphic to the corresponding spherical sub-algebra of our new confluent
Cherednik algebras. We show that in the basic representation our confluent
Zhedanov algebras act as symmetries of certain elements of the q-Askey scheme,
thus setting a stepping stone towards the solution of the open problem of
finding the corresponding quantum algebra for each element of the q-Askey

The iOLM learning module was implemented using server side web software (php)

physics in their second year. This approach follows the hybrid online learning
model. Students had to complete a section of the course using iOLM, which was
only presented online. The data obtained for this class showed a wide spread of
learning paces, ranging from 0.1 to 0.5, where 1 is the maximum pace allowed by
iOLM and 0 the lowest. The mean was mu=0.25, with a standard deviation of
sigma=0.12. While the pretest showed a positive correlation between the
student's pace and performance, the postest had zero correlation, indicating
that giving more time and content to weaker students allows them to catch up.

standard model (MSSM) with a strong supersymmetry breaking trilinear term.
Supersymmetry breaking can trigger electroweak symmetry breaking via a
symmetry-breaking seesaw mechanism, which can lead to a low-energy theory with
multiple composite Higgs bosons. In this model, the electroweak phase
transition can be first-order for some generic values of parameters.
Furthermore, there are additional sources of CP violation in the Higgs sector.
This opens the possibility of electroweak baryogenesis in the strongly coupled
MSSM. The extended Higgs dynamics can be discovered at Large Hadron Collider or
at a future linear collider.

pathogens is the nowadays challenge. Antimicrobial peptides (AMP) occur as
important defence agents in many organisms and offer a viable alternative to
conventional antibiotics. Therefore they have become increasingly recognized in
current research as templates for prospective antibiotic agents. The efficient
designing of the new antimicrobials on the basis of antimicrobial peptides
requires comprehensive knowledge on those general physical-chemical
characteristics which allow to differ antimicrobial peptides from non-active
against microbs ones. According to supposed mechanisms of action, AMP interact
with and physically disrupt the bacterial membranes. Consequently,
hydrophobicity, amphiphilicity and intrinsic aggregation propensities are
considered as such major characteristics of the peptide, which determine the
results of peptide-membrane interactions. For some kind of peptides such
characteristics as hydrophobicity, amphiphilicity and aggregation bias
determines their ability to compose transmembrane domain of the membrane
protein, whilst for others the same properties are respond for their
antimicrpobial activity, i.e. give them ability of membrane permeability and
its damage. In this review we analyze the data about hydrophobicity,
amphiphilicity and intrinsic aggregation propensities available in literature
in order to compare antimicrobial and transmembrane peptides and show what is
the common and what is the difference in this respect between them.

that solve equations of motion of a 5-dimensional Einstein-Hilbert-scalar

quark-antiquark pair moving at constant velocity through the plasma, the
running coupling defined via the free energy of such a static pair, and the
energy radiation from a heavy quark forced into a circular motion in the
plasma. We find that these observables show universal behaviour in large
classes of theories. The screening distance in these classes of theories, that
is the maximal distance for which a heavy quark-antiquark pair is bound, is
found to be bounded from below by its value in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory.

causal sets and show that under natural conditions space-time emerges from
them. These are causal sets whose causal links are labelled by energy and
momentum and conservation laws are applied at events. The models are motivated
by principles we propose govern microscopic physics which posit a fundamental
irreversibility of time. One consequence is that each event in the history of
the universe has a distinct causal relationship to the rest; this requires a
novel form of dynamics which an be applied to uniquely distinctive events. We
hence introduce a new kind of deterministic dynamics for a causal set in which
new events are generated from pairs of progenitor events by a rule which is
based on extremizing the distinctions between causal past sets of events. This
dynamics is asymmetric in time, but we find evidence from numerical simulations
of a 1+1 dimensional model, that an effective dynamics emerges which restores
approximate time reversal symmetry. Energetic causal set models differ from
other spacetime-free causal set approaches, e.g. Ref. [1] proposed causal sets
based on quantum information processing systems, and Ref. [2] proposed causal
sets constructed out of standard model particles. Finally we also present a
natural twistorial representation of energetic causal sets.

the Color Glass Condensate (CGC), a model proposed to describe the high energy

predicts that multiplicity in p+A depends linearly on $N_{part}$. We argue that
for the first time, the dependence of mean multiplicity on $N_{part}$ in p+A

new class of tidal disruption events: the disruption of a helium-rich stellar
core, thought to be a remnant of a red giant (RG) star. Motivated by this
discovery and in anticipation of others, we consider tidal interaction of an RG
star with a supermassive black hole (SMBH) which leads to the stripping of the
stellar envelope and subsequent inspiral of the compact core toward the black
hole. Once the stellar envelope is removed the inspiral of the core is driven
by tidal heating as well as the emission of gravitational radiation until the
core either falls into the SMBH or is tidally disrupted. In the case of tidal
disruption candidate PS1-10jh we find that there is a set of orbital solutions
at high eccentricities in which the tidally stripped hydrogen envelope is
accreted by the SMBH before the helium core is disrupted. This places the RG
core in a portion of parameter space where strong tidal heating can lift the
degeneracy of the compact remnant and disrupt it before it reaches the tidal
radius. We consider how this sequence of events explains the puzzling absence
of the hydrogen emission lines from the spectrum of PS1-10jh and gives rise to
its other observational features.

altruists in a group. In the case this function is linear, there are two
possible steady states which correspond to the non-altruistic and the
altruistic phases. At the discontinuous transition line separating these phases
there is a non-ergodic coexistence phase. For a continuous concave survival
function, we find an ergodic coexistence phase that occupies a finite region of
the parameter space in between the altruistic and the non-altruistic phases,
and is separated from these phases by continuous transition lines. For a convex
survival function, the coexistence phase disappears altogether but a bistable
phase appears for which the choice of the initial condition determines whether
the evolutionary dynamics leads to the altruistic or the non-altruistic steady
state.

to the spinon in this material, liberates itself from the spinon due to the

(0.4<=z<0.77 and 0.77<=z<1.0) and a local range (0.02<=z<0.05). The mean
surface-brightness, from z_{mean}=0.89 to z_{mean}=0.04, shows a dimming of
0.79 mag for bulgeless galaxies and 1.16 mag for normal-discs. The
characteristic magnitude, M_B^*, shows an increase of 0.55-mag for bulgeless
galaxies and 0.95-mag for normal-discs. Both dimming and faintness observed
since z~0.9 are more pronounced for the normal-discs by ~0.4-mag. The
size-distribution is log-normal and both bulgeless and normal-discs show a
slight increase in the mean value from z_{mean}=0.89 to z_{mean}=0.04. The
proportion of bulgeless galaxies in the full disc sample undergoes a
considerable decline with decrease in redshift. This along with the larger
dimming and faintness seen for normal-discs suggests that some fraction of the
bulgeless sources switch to the normal-disc morphology with time. To ascertain
the validity of studying morphology in the optical, the properties of the
galaxies observed in both rest-frame B and I-band are compared. The common
sample is more luminous in the I-band but the sizes are larger in the B-band
for more than 74 % of the sources. The variation in the sersic-index values of
the galaxies in the two rest-bands is minor enough to have any affect on the

This independence on the network clustering shows that the small-world property
is a sufficient condition for the mean-field theory to correctly predict the
universality of the model. Moreover, we compare the CP dynamics on WS networks

weak heterogeneity of the WS network slightly changes the critical point but

essential quantity for estimating the size of a PN population in the context of
general population studies. For instance, it enters directly into the PN death
rate determination. The basic ingredient for determining visibility times is
the typical nebular expansion velocity, as a suited average over all PN sizes
of a PN population within a certain volume or stellar system. The true
expansion speed of the outer nebular edge of a PN is, however, not accessible
by spectroscopy -- a difficulty that we surmount by radiation-hydrodynamics
modelling. We find a mean true expansion velocity of 42 km/s, i.e. nearly twice
as high as the commonly adopted value to date. Accordingly, the time for a PN
to expand to a radius of, say 0.9 pc, is only 21000 +/- 5000 years. This
visibility time of a PN holds for all central star masses since a nebula does
not become extinct as the central star fades. There is, however, a dependence
on metallicity in the sense that the visibility time becomes shorter for lower
nebular metal content. With the higher expansion rate of PNe derived here we
determined their local death-rate density as (1.4 +/- 0.5) x E-12 PN pc^{-3}
yr^{-1}, using the local PN density advocated by Frew (2008).

(EOSs) applicable in core-collapse supernova studies. The large variety of
nuclear matter properties, such as the symmetry energy, which are covered by
these EOSs leads to distinct outcomes in supernova simulations. Many of the
currently used EOS models can be ruled out by nuclear experiments, nuclear
many-body calculations, and observations of neutron stars. In particular the
two classical supernova EOS describe neutron matter poorly. Nevertheless, we
explore their impact in supernova simulations since they are commonly used in
astrophysics. They serve as extremely soft and stiff representative nuclear
models. The corresponding supernova simulations represent two extreme cases,
e.g., with respect to the protoneutron star (PNS) compactness and shock
evolution. Moreover, in multi-dimensional supernova simulations EOS differences
have a strong effect on the explosion dynamics. Because of the extreme
behaviors of the classical supernova EOSs we also include DD2, a relativistic
mean field EOS with density-dependent couplings, which is in satisfactory
agreement with many current nuclear and observational constraints. This is the
first time that DD2 is applied to supernova simulations and compared with the
classical supernova EOS. We find that the overall behaviour of the latter EOS
in supernova simulations lies in between the two extreme classical EOSs. As
pointed out in previous studies, we confirm the impact of the symmetry energy
on the electron fraction. Furthermore, we find that the symmetry energy becomes
less important during the post bounce evolution, where conversely the symmetric
part of the EOS becomes increasingly dominating, which is related to the high
temperatures obtained. Moreover, we study the possible impact of quark matter
at high densities and light nuclear clusters at low and intermediate dens

local well-posedness all the way to the critical regularity of $s_c=1$.

initial data in the Fourier-Lebesgue spaces $\^{H}_s^r$, which coincide with
the Sobolev spaces of the same regularity for $r=2$, but scale like lower

local well-posedness for the model null-form problem for the almost critical

reservoir of warm-hot gas that contains a large fraction of the missing baryons
from the Galaxy. The average physical properties of this circumgalactic medium
(CGM) are determined by combining average absorption and emission measurements
along several extragalactic sightlines. However, there is a wide distribution
of both, the halo emission measure and the \ovii column density, suggesting
that the Galactic warm-hot gaseous halo is anisotropic. We present {\it Suzaku}
observations of fields close to two sightlines along which we have precise
\ovii absorption measurements with \chandran. The column densities along these
two sightlines are similar within errors, but we find that the emission
measures are different. Therefore the densities and pathlengths in the two
directions must be different, providing a suggestive evidence that the warm-hot
gas in the CGM of the Milky Way is not distributed uniformly. However, the
formal errors on derived parameters are too large to make such a claim. The
average density and pathlength of the two sightlines are similar to the global
averages, so the halo mass is still huge, over 10 billion solar masses. With
more such studies, we will be able to better characterize the CGM anisotropy
and measure its mass more accurately. We also show that the Galactic disk makes
insignificant contribution to the observed \ovii absorption; a similar
conclusion was also reached independently about the emission measure. We
further argue that any density inhomogeneity in the warm-hot gas, be it from
clumping, from the disk, or from a non-constant density gradient, would
strengthen our result in that the Galactic halo path-length and the mass would
become larger than what we estimate here. As such, our results are conservative
and robust.

nonspherical circumstellar envelopes of classical Be stars produces a distinct

They are inclined relative to each other by 35 deg. Comparing the plane
orientations with each other and with additional features indicates an intimate
connection between the VPOS and the GPoA. They are both polar to the MW, have
similar orbital directions and are inclined by ~45 deg relative to each other.
The Magellanic Stream approximately aligns with the VPOS and the GPoA, but also
shares its projected position and line-of-sight velocity trend with the
dominating structure of non-satellite dwarf galaxies. The proper motion of M31
indicates a prograde orbit of the MW-M31 system, the VPOS and the GPoA. The
alignment with other features such as the Supergalactic Plane and the
over-density in hypervelocity stars are discussed as well. We end with a
summary of proposed scenarios trying to explain the LG galaxy structures as
either originating from cosmological structures or from tidal debris of a past
galaxy encounter. There currently exists no full detailed model which
satisfactorily explains the existence of the thin symmetric LG planes.

appear to have: gas masses <~2x10^8 Msun; very low star formation rate,
~10^{-3} - 10^{-2} Msun/yr (significantly weaker than late-time counterparts);
mean molecular fractions covering a fairly wide range, x_mol~10^{-3}- 10^{-6};

formation rates across a broad range of redshifts. Despite their importance, a
detailed physical understanding of what drives these mass-loaded global flows
has remained elusive. In this paper, we explore the dynamical impact of cosmic
rays by performing the first three-dimensional, adaptive mesh refinement
simulations of an isolated starbursting galaxy that includes a basic model for
the production, dynamics and diffusion of galactic cosmic rays. We find that
including cosmic rays naturally leads to robust, massive, bipolar outflows from
our 10^12 Msun halo, with a mass-loading factor Mout/SFR = 0.3 for our fiducial
run. Other reasonable parameter choices led to mass-loading factors above
unity. The wind is multiphase and is accelerated to velocities well in excess
of the escape velocity. We employ a two-fluid model for the thermal gas and
relativistic CR plasma and model a range of physics relevant to galaxy
formation, including radiative cooling, shocks, self-gravity, star formation,
supernovae feedback into both the thermal and CR gas, and isotropic CR
diffusion. Injecting cosmic rays into star-forming regions can provide
significant pressure support for the interstellar medium, suppressing star
formation and thickening the disk. We find that CR diffusion plays a central
role in driving superwinds, rapidly transferring long-lived CRs from the
highest density regions of the disk to the ISM at large, where their pressure
gradient can smoothly accelerate the gas out of the disk.

a distinguishing feature of the polarization signature in these objects and, as
such, can be used as a tool for differentiating classical Be stars from similar
H alpha-emitters identified through conventional photometric techniques. We
find that although low-metallicity environments will have hotter disk
temperatures on average, the temperature change alone cannot account for the
discrepancy in the frequency of Balmer jumps between low-metallicity and
solar-metallicity stellar populations. Second, we investigate the effect of
including a global one-armed oscillation in the gas density distribution of the
modeled disk. We find that a non-axisymmetric perturbation pattern yields
discernible variations in the predicted polarization level. If these density
oscillations are present in the inner region of classical Be star disks, the
polarimetric variations should produce a periodic signature which can help
characterize the dynamical nature of the gas near the star.

suppressed errors give rise to super-exponential inverse temperature scaling

models, the blurred reflection model provided statistically the best-fit to all
the four observations. Irrespective of the models used, the soft X-ray excess
emission requires contribution from a thermal component similar to that
expected from an accretion disk. The partial covering absorption model results
in a nonphysical high temperature ($kT_{in} \sim 100\ev$) for an accretion disk
and is also statistically the worst fit among the three models. 1H~0419--577
showed remarkable X-ray spectral variability. The soft X-ray excess and the
power-law both became weaker in January 2010 as well as in May 2010. A
moderately broad iron line, detected in July 2007, is absent in the January
2010 observation. Correlated variability of the soft X-ray excess and the iron

for 24 local (z<0.262) ULIRGs observed with Herschel-PACS as part of the

shape and therefore imply outflowing OH gas, other profiles are predominantly
in absorption or are completely in emission. We find that the relative strength
of the OH emission component decreases as the silicate absorption increases.
This locates the OH outflows inside the obscured nuclei. The maximum outflow
velocities for our sources range from less than 100 to 2000 km/s, with 15/24
(10/24) sources showing OH absorption at velocities exceeding 700 km/s (1000
km/s). Three sources show maximum OH outflow velocities exceeding that of
Mrk231. Since outflow velocities above 500-700 km/s are thought to require an
active galactic nucleus (AGN) to drive them, about 2/3 of our ULIRG sample may
host AGN-driven molecular outflows. This finding is supported by the
correlation we find between the maximum OH outflow velocity and the IR-derived
bolometric AGN luminosity. No such correlation is found with the IR-derived
star formation rate. The highest outflow velocities are found among sources
which are still deeply embedded. We speculate that the molecular outflows in
these sources may be in an early phase of disrupting the nuclear dust veil
before these sources evolve into less obscured AGN. Four of our sources show
high-velocity wings in their [C II] fine-structure line profiles implying
neutral gas outflow masses of at least 2-4.5 x 10^8 Msun.

magnetic form factors provide new insight into their exact shape, deviating
from the classical dipole form, and of structure on top of this gross shape.
The data reaching very low $Q^2$ values are used for a new determination of the
electric and magnetic radii. An empirical determination of the
Two-Photon-Exchange (TPE) correction is presented. The implications of this
correction on the radii and the question of a directly visible signal of the

explore whether the lack of old clusters ($\gtrsim 7$ Gyr) in the Small
Magellanic Cloud (SMC) can be the result of the capture of clusters by the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), as well as their ejection due to the tidal
interaction between the two galaxies. For this purpose we perform a suite of
numerical simulations probing a wide range of parameters for the orbit of the
SMC about the LMC. We find that, for orbital eccentricities $e \geq 0.4$,
approximately 15 per cent of the SMC clusters are captured by the LMC. In
addition, another 20 to 50 per cent of its clusters are ejected into the
intergalactic medium. In general, the clusters lost by the SMC are the less
tightly bound cluster population. The final LMC cluster distribution shows a
spatial segregation between clusters that originally belonged to the LMC and
those that were captured from the SMC. Clusters that originally belonged to the
SMC are more likely to be found in the outskirts of the LMC. Within this
scenario it is possible to interpret the difference observed between the star
field and cluster SMC Age-Metallicity Relationships for ages $\gtrsim 7$ Gyr.

carry out the matching of the inspiral-plunge to merger-ringdown waveforms. As
a first application, we build spinning, precessing EOB waveforms for the
gravitational modes l=2 such that in the nonprecessing limit those waveforms
agree with the EOB waveforms recently calibrated to numerical-relativity
waveforms. Without recalibrating the EOB model, we then compare EOB and
post-Newtonian precessing waveforms to two numerical-relativity waveforms
produced by the Caltech-Cornell-CITA collaboration. The numerical waveforms are
strongly precessing and have 35 and 65 gravitational-wave cycles. We find a
remarkable agreement between EOB and numerical-relativity precessing waveforms

mismatches, computed using the advanced-LIGO noise spectral density, are below

compare the direction of the instantaneous radiated angular momentum,
$\hat{\delta J}_{\rm rad}(t)$, to the directions of the total angular momentum,
$\hat{J}(t)$, and the orbital angular momentum, $\hat{L}(t)$. We find that
$\hat{\delta J}_{\rm rad}(t)$ approximately follows $\hat{L}$ throughout the
evolution. During the orbital evolution and merger, we observe that the angle
between $\vec{L}$ and total spin $\vec{S}$ is approximately conserved to within
$1^\circ$, which allows us to propose and test models for the merger remnant's
mass and spin. For instance, we verify that the \hangup effect is the dominant
effect and largely explains the observed total energy and angular momentum
radiated by these precessing systems. We also verify that the total angular
momentum, which significantly decreases in magnitude during the inspiral,
varies in direction by less than $\sim 5^\circ$. The maximum variation in the
direction of $\vec J$ occurs when the spins are nearly antialigned with the
orbital angular momentum. Based on our results, we conjecture that transitional
precession, which would lead to large variations in the direction of $\vec J$,
is not possible for similar-mass binaries and would require a mass ratio
$m_1/m_2\lesssim1/4$.

flow of values between components. However, run-time monitoring and enforcement
of contracts imposes significant overhead and delays discovery of faulty
components to run-time.
  To overcome these issues, we present soft contract verification, which aims
to statically prove either complete or partial contract correctness of
components, written in an untyped, higher-order language with first-class
contracts. Our approach uses higher-order symbolic execution, leveraging
contracts as a source of symbolic values including unknown behavioral values,
and employs an updatable heap of contract invariants to reason about
flow-sensitive facts. We prove the symbolic execution soundly approximates the
dynamic semantics and that verified programs can't be blamed.
  The approach is able to analyze first-class contracts, recursive data
structures, unknown functions, and control-flow-sensitive refinements of
values, which are all idiomatic in dynamic languages. It makes effective use of
an off-the-shelf solver to decide problems without heavy encodings. The
approach is competitive with a wide range of existing tools---including type
systems, flow analyzers, and model checkers---on their own benchmarks.

shell is ~24 km s^{-1}, implying a crossing time of about 2000 yrs. Along the

which are often encountered in game theory and economics. These are complex
problems with a hierarchical structure, where one optimization task is nested
within the other. Despite a number of studies on handling bilevel optimization
problems, these problems still remain a challenging territory, and existing
methodologies are able to handle only simple problems with few variables under
assumptions of continuity and differentiability. In this paper, we consider a
special case of a multi-period multi-leader-follower Stackelberg competition
model with non-linear cost and demand functions and discrete production
variables. The model has potential applications, for instance in aircraft
manufacturing industry, which is an oligopoly where a few giant firms enjoy a
tremendous commitment power over the other smaller players. We solve cases with
different number of leaders and followers, and show how the entrance or exit of
a player affects the profits of the other players. In the presence of various
model complexities, we use a computationally intensive nested evolutionary
strategy to find an optimal solution for the model. The strategy is evaluated
on a test-suite of bilevel problems, and it has been shown that the method is
successful in handling difficult bilevel problems.

transition between the classical $-$5/3 energy spectrum scaling for a
single-phase turbulent flow and the $-$3 scaling for a swarm of bubbles rising
in a quiescent liquid and of bubble-dominated turbulence. The bubblance
parameter, which measures the ratio of the bubble-induced kinetic energy to the
kinetic energy induced by the turbulent liquid fluctuations before bubble
injection, is often used to characterise the bubbly flow. We vary the bubblance
parameter from $b = \infty$ (pseudo-turbulence) to $b = 0$ (single-phase flow)
over 2-3 orders of magnitude ($0.01 - 5$) to study its effect on the turbulent
energy spectrum and liquid velocity fluctuations. The probability density
functions (PDFs) of the liquid velocity fluctuations show deviations from the
Gaussian profile for $b > 0$, i.e. when bubbles are present in the system. The
PDFs are asymmetric with higher probability in the positive tails. The energy
spectra are found to follow the $-$3 scaling at length scales smaller than the
size of the bubbles for bubbly flows. This $-$3 spectrum scaling holds not only
in the well-established case of pseudo-turbulence, but surprisingly in all
cases where bubbles are present in the system ($b > 0$). Therefore, it is a
generic feature of turbulent bubbly flows, and the bubblance parameter is
probably not a suitable parameter to characterise the energy spectrum in bubbly
turbulent flows. The physical reason is that the energy input by the bubbles
passes over only to higher wave numbers, and the energy production due to the
bubbles can be directly balanced by the viscous dissipation in the bubble wakes
as suggested by Lance $\&$ Bataille (1991). In addition, we provide an
alternative explanation by balancing the energy production of the bubbles with
viscous dissipation in the Fourier space.

an important impact on the radio-infrared (IR) correlation in galaxies. This
becomes evident when studying different spatial scales within galaxies. We
investigate the correlation between the infrared (IR) and free-free/synchrotron
radio continuum emission at 20 cm from the two local group galaxies M31 and M33
on spatial scales between 0.4 and 10 kpc. The multi-scale radio-IR correlations
have been carried out using a wavelet analysis. The free-free and IR emission
are correlated on all scales, but on some scales the synchrotron emission is
only marginally correlated with the IR emission. The synchrotron-IR correlation
is stronger in M33 than in M31 on small scales (<1 kpc), but it is weaker than
in M31 on larger scales. Taking the smallest scale on which the synchrotron-IR
correlation exists as the propagation length of cosmic ray electrons, we show
that the difference on small scales can be explained by the smaller propagation
length in M33 than in M31. On large scales, the difference is due to the thick
disk/halo in M33, which is absent in M31. A comparison of our data with data on
NGC6946, the LMC and M51 suggests that the propagation length is determined by
the ratio of ordered-to-turbulent magnetic field strength, which is consistent
with diffusion of CR electrons in the ISM. As the diffusion length of CR
electrons influences the radio-IR correlation, this dependence is a direct
observational evidence of the importance of magnetic fields for the radio-IR
correlation within galaxies. The star formation rate per surface area only
indirectly influences the diffusion length as it increases the strength of the
turbulent magnetic field.

readily observable most of the expelled mass is likely in cooler atomic and

wind. While shell properties are well constrained, determining the amount of
outflowing gas emerging from such shells and the connection between this gas

molecular outflow rate to be > 3 Msun/yr and likely ~9 Msun/yr. This implies a

technique, while maintaining a large DC current through the source-drain
channel. We find that in a parallel magnetic field, the resistance of the
sample, R(I_DC), is asymmetric with respect to the direction of the DC current.
The asymmetry becomes stronger with an increase of either the magnetic field or
the difference between n_1 and n_2. These observations are interpreted in terms
of the effective spin injection: the degree of spin polarisation is different
in the two parts of the sample, implying different magnitudes of spin current
away from the slot. The carriers thus leave the excess spin (of the appropriate
sign) in the region around the slot, leading to spin accumulation (or
depletion) and to the spin drift-diffusion phenomena. Due to the positive
magnetoresistance of the two-dimensional electron gas, this change in a local
magnetisation affects the resistivity near the slot and the measured net
resistance, giving rise to an asymmetric contribution. We further observe that
the value of R(I_DC) saturates at large I_DC; we suggest that this is due to
electron tunnelling from the two-dimensional n-type layer into the p-type
silicon (or into another ""spin reservoir"") at the slot.

properties: Their orbit space of null rays possesses the structure of a
non-relativistic spacetime of codimension-one. Their geodesics are in
one-to-one correspondence with dynamical trajectories of a non-relativistic

this class of gravitational waves leads to a Schroedinger equation on curved
space. These properties are generalized to the class of gravitational waves
with a null Killing vector field, of which we propose a new geometric
definition, as conformally equivalent to the previous class and such that the

performing this generalization, as well as various applications. In particular,
results on geodesic completeness are extended in a similar way. Moreover, the

absorption profiles in the spectrum of the quasar J115122.14+020426.3 between
observations ~2.86 years apart in the quasar rest-frame. A 2001 spectrum from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) shows a CIV ""mini-broad"" absorption line
(FWHM=1,220 km/s) with a maximum blueshift velocity ~9,520 km/s, while a later
spectrum from the Very Large Telescope (VLT) shows significantly broader and
stronger absorption line, with a maximum blueshift velocity of ~12,240 km/s,
that qualifies as a broad absorption line. A similar variability pattern is
observed in two additional systems at lower blueshifted velocities and in the
Lya and NV transitions as well. One of the absorption systems appears to be
resolved and shows evidence for partial covering of the quasar continuum source
(Cf~0.65), indicating a transverse absorber size of, at least, ~6 x 10^(16) cm.
In contrast, a cluster of narrower CIV lines appears to originate in gas that
fully covers the continuum and broad emission line sources. There is no
evidence for changes in the centroid velocity of the absorption troughs. This
case suggests that, at least some of the absorbers that produce ""mini-broad""
and broad absorption lines in quasar spectra do not belong to intrinsically
separate classes. Here, the ""mini-broad"" absorption line is most likely
interpreted as an intermediate phase before the appearance of a broad
absorption line due to their similar velocity. While the current observations
do not provide enough constraints to discern among the possible causes for this
variability, future monitoring of multiple transitions at high resolution will
help achieve this goal.

only considered mergers of BBHs which escape from GCs (BBH escapers). BBH
escapers merge more quickly than BBHs inside GCs because of their small
semi-major axes. N-body simulation can not deal with a GC with the number of
stars N ~ 10^6 due to its high calculation cost. We have simulated dynamical
evolution of small-N clusters (10^4 <~ N <~ 10^5), and have extrapolated our
simulation results to large-N clusters. From our simulation results, we have
found the following dependence of BBH properties on N. BBHs escape from a
cluster at each two-body relaxation time at a rate proportional to N.
Semi-major axes of BBH escapers are inversely proportional to N, if initial
mass densities of clusters are fixed. Eccentricities, primary masses, and mass
ratios of BBH escapers are independent of N. Using this dependence of BBH
properties, we have artificially generated a population of BBH escapers from a
GC with N ~ 10^6, and have estimated a detection rate of mergers of BBH
escapers by next-generation GW observatories. We have assumed that all the GCs
are formed 10 or 12Gyrs ago with their initial numbers of stars N_i=5 x 10^5 --
2 x 10^6 and their initial stellar mass densities inside their half-mass radii
\rho_h,i=6 x 10^3 -- 10^6M_sun pc^-3. Then, the detection rate of BBH escapers
is 0.5 -- 20 yr^-1 for a BH retention fraction R_BH=0.5. A few BBH escapers are
components of hierarchical triple systems, although we do not consider secular
perturbation on such BBH escapers for our estimate. Our simulations have shown
that BHs are still inside some of GCs at the present day. These BHs may
marginally contribute to BBH detection.

exhibit a peculiar property: a substantial excess of ultraviolet emission (UVX)
over what is expected from their old, red stellar populations. Several origins
for the UVX have been proposed, including a population of hot young stars, or a
population of old, blue horizontal branch or extended horizontal branch (BHB or
EHB) stars that have undergone substantial mass loss from their outer
atmospheres. We explore the radial distribution of ultraviolet excess (UVX) in
a selection of 49 nearby E/S0-type galaxies by measuring the extended
photometry in the UV-midIR with GALEX, SDSS and WISE. We compare UV/optical and
UV/mid-IR colors with the Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis with EHB models
(Conroy & Gunn 2010). We find that combined WISE mid-IR and GALEX UV colors are
more effective in distinguishing models than optical colors, and that the
UV/mid-IR combination is sensitive to EHB fraction. There are strong color
gradients with the outer radii bluer than the inner half-light radii by ~1
magnitude. This color difference is easily accounted for with a BHB fraction
increase of 0.25 with radius. We estimated the average ages for the inner and
outer radii are 7.0+/-0.3 Gyr, and 6.2+/-0.2 Gyr, respectively, with the
implication that the outer regions are likely to have formed ~1 Gyr after the

difference (e.g., higher EHB populations), and the ~0.5-2 Gyr age difference

torques onto a black hole binary migrating in a self-gravitating, retrograde
circumbinary disc. A direct comparison with an identical prograde disc shows
that: (i) because of the absence of resonances, the cavity size is a factor
a(1+e) smaller for retrograde discs; (ii) nonetheless the shrinkage of a
circular binary semi--major axis, a, is identical in both cases; (iii) a
circular binary in a retrograde disc remains circular while eccentric binaries
grow more eccentric. For non-circular binaries, we measure the orbital decay
rates and the eccentricity growth rates to be exponential as long as the binary
orbits in the plane of its disc. Additionally, for these co-planar systems, we
find that interaction (~ non--zero torque) stems only from the cavity edge plus
a(1+e) in the disc, i.e. for dynamical purposes, the disc can be treated as a
annulus of small radial extent. We find that simple 'dust' models in which the
binary- disc interaction is purely gravitational can account for all main
numerical results, both for prograde and retrograde discs. Furthermore, we
discuss the possibility of an instability occurring for highly eccentric
binaries causing it to leave the disc plane, secularly tilt and converge to a
prograde system. Our results suggest that there are two stable configurations
for binaries in self-gravitating discs: the special circular retrograde case
and an eccentric (e~ 0.6) prograde configuration as a stable attractor.

harvest energy from the transmitter by wireless energy transfer to support its

we propose to perform adaptive energy beamforming according to the

obtain the CSI for energy beamforming, we further propose a win-win CSI
quantization feedback strategy, so as to improve the efficiencies of both power

wireless energy and information transfer by adjusting the transfer duration
with a total duration constraint. Through revealing the relationship between
transmit power, transfer duration and feedback amount, we derive two wireless
energy and information transfer tradeoff schemes by maximizing an upper bound
and an approximate lower bound of the average information transmission rate,
respectively. Moreover, the impact of imperfect CSI at the receiver is
investigated and the corresponding wireless energy and information transfer
tradeoff scheme is also given. Finally, numerical results validate the
effectiveness of the proposed schemes.

the algorithm for a given decomposition into one and two qubits gates. In the
DQCp model the final state is strongly quantum correlated for some balanced
functions, so that the pairwise entanglement between blocks scales with the
system size. Although the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm is efficiently implemented in
both models of computation, the presence of quantum correlations is not a
sufficient property for computational gain in this case, since the performance
of the classical probabilistic algorithm is better than the quantum ones. The
measurement of other qubits than the control one showed to be inefficient to

main idea is to incorporate feature point matching as a constraint in active

contour alignment, and we formulate the matching score as a constraint to

the contour alignment provides the initial feasible solution to the constrained
optimization model of segmentation. The constraint also ensures that the

grating with a Burgers vector of 1 shows an OAM transfer of nh. Hence, the
diffraction patterns become mirror asymmetric owing to the size difference
between the electron beams. Such a forked grating, when used in combination
with a pinhole located at the diffraction plane, could act as an analyzer to
measure the OAM of input electrons.

stellar temperature range of 4200 to 8000 K, log g range of 0.5 to 5.0, and
[Fe/H] range of -3.0 to +0.3 dex. This empirical spectral library was used to
train ANNs, yielding an accuracy of 0.3 dex in [Fe/H], 200 K in temperature,
and 0.3 dex in log g. We found that the independent calibrations of near-solar
metallicity stars and metal-poor stars decreases the errors in T_eff and log g
by nearly a factor of two. We calculated T_eff, log g, and [Fe/H] on a
consistent scale for a large number of field stars and candidate metal-poor
stars. We extended the application of this method to the calibration of
absolute magnitudes using nearby stars with well-estimated parallaxes. A better
calibration accuracy for M_V could be obtained by training separate ANNs for
cool, warm, and metal-poor stars. The current accuracy of M_V calibration is
(+-)0.3 mag. A list of newly identified metal-poor stars is presented. The M_V

well-established by the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle when the

in some of the gap in the understanding and states uncertainty relation for a
subclass of finite discrete signals. Interestingly, the result is a close
parallel to that of the continuous domain: the time-frequency spread measure
is, in some sense, natural generalization of the variance measure in the

derivatives with respect to $\KK$ of the second-order term of $\Delta E(\KK)$,

second-order term of $m_\parallel^*(\KK)$ presents points of
non-differentiability, replaced by a logarithmic divergence for $M=m$, when
$\KK$ is on the Fermi surface of the fermions. We also discuss the third-order

deseasonalised spot prices can be modelled directly in stationarity. Second,
stochastic volatility is regarded as a key factor for modelling energy spot

autocorrelation structure and the Samuelson effect. We provide a detailed
analysis of the probabilistic properties of VMLV processes and show how they

guaranteed to satisfy the specification. In synthesis of reactive systems, the

environment. In this case, we should transform a specification into a program
whose behavior depends only on the observable history of the computation. This
is called synthesis with incomplete information. In such a setting, it is
desirable to have a knowledge-based specification, which can refer to the
uncertainty the program has about the environment's behavior. In this work we
solve the problem of synthesis with incomplete information with respect to

visualization. Signals detected at each element are sampled prior to digital
beamforming. The sampling rates required to perform high resolution digital
beamforming are significantly higher than the Nyquist rate of the signal and
result in considerable amount of data, that needs to be stored and processed. A
recently developed technique, compressed beamforming, based on the finite rate
of innovation model, compressed sensing (CS) and Xampling ideas, allows to
reduce the number of samples needed to reconstruct an image comprised of strong
reflectors. A drawback of this method is its inability to treat speckle, which
is of significant importance in medical imaging. Here we build on previous work
and extend it to a general concept of beamforming in frequency. This allows to
exploit the low bandwidth of the ultrasound signal and bypass the oversampling
dictated by digital implementation of beamforming in time. Using beamforming in
frequency, the same image quality is obtained from far fewer samples. We next
present a CS-technique that allows for further rate reduction, using only a
portion of the beamformed signal's bandwidth. We demonstrate our methods on in
vivo cardiac data and show that reductions up to 1/28 over standard beamforming
rates are possible. Finally, we present an implementation on an ultrasound
machine using sub-Nyquist sampling and processing. Our results prove that the
concept of sub-Nyquist processing is feasible for medical ultrasound, leading

DELPHES is to allow the simulation of a multipurpose detector for
phenomenological studies. The simulation includes a track propagation system
embedded in a magnetic field, electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters, and a
muon identification system. Physics objects that can be used for data analysis
are then reconstructed from the simulated detector response. These include
tracks and calorimeter deposits and high level objects such as isolated
electrons, jets, taus, and missing energy. The new modular approach allows for
greater flexibility in the design of the simulation and reconstruction
sequence. New features such as the particle-flow reconstruction approach,
crucial in the first years of the LHC, and pile-up simulation and mitigation,
which is needed for the simulation of the LHC detectors in the near future,
have also been implemented. The DELPHES framework is not meant to be used for
advanced detector studies, for which more accurate tools are needed. Although
some aspects of DELPHES are hadron collider specific, it is flexible enough to
be adapted to the needs of electron-positron collider experiments.

the intensive demand for location based service, and Wi-Fi fingerprint-based
approaches are the most popular and inexpensive solutions. Among them, one of
the main trends is to incorporate the built-in sensors of smartphone and to
exploit crowdsourcing potentials. However the noisy built-in sensors and
multi-tasking limitation of underline OS often hinder the effectiveness of
these schemes. In this work, we propose a passive crowdsourcing CSI-based
indoor localization scheme, C2 IL. Our scheme C2 IL only requires the
locating-device (e.g., a phone) to have a 802.11n wireless connection, and it
does not rely on inertial sensors only existing in some smartphones. C2 IL is
built upon our innovative method to accurately estimate the moving distance
purely based on 802.11n Channel State Information (CSI). Our extensive
evaluations show that the moving distance estimation error of our scheme is
within 3% of the actual moving distance regardless of varying speeds and
environment. Relying on the accurate moving distance estimation as constraints,
we are able to construct a more accurate mapping between RSS fingerprints and
location. To address the challenges of collecting fingerprints, a
crowdsourcing- based scheme is designed to gradually establish the mapping and
populate the fingerprints. In C2 IL, we design a trajectory clustering-based
localization algorithm to provide precise real-time indoor localization and
tracking. We developed and deployed a practical working system of C2 IL in a
large office environment. Extensive evaluation results indicate that our scheme
C2 IL provides accurate localization with error 2m at 80% at very complex
indoor environment with minimal overhead.

field can be described as diffusion early in a particle event. We compare the
full-orbit code results to solutions of a Fokker-Planck equation including
spatial and pitch angle diffusion, and of one including also propagation of the
particles along random-walking magnetic field lines. We find that propagation
of the particles along meandering field lines is the key process determining
their cross-field spread at 1 AU at the beginning of the simulated event. The
mean square displacement of the particles an hour after injection is an order
of magnitude larger than that given by the diffusion model, indicating that
models employing spatial cross-field diffusion cannot be used to describe early
evolution of an SEP event. On the other hand, the diffusion of the particles
from their initial field lines is negligible during the first 5 hours, which is
consistent with the observations of SEP intensity dropouts. We conclude that
modelling SEP events must take into account the particle propagation along
meandering field lines for the first 20 hours of the event.

the same words to similar polynomials. Moreover, a histogram of the frequencies
of the words is constructed from each time-series' bag of words. Each row of
the histogram enables a new representation for the series and symbolize the
existence of local patterns and their frequencies. Experimental evidence
demonstrates outstanding results of our method compared to the state-of-art
baselines, by exhibiting the best classification accuracies in all the datasets
and having statistically significant improvements in the absolute majority of
experiments.

through Stochastic Partial differential equations (SPDEs), are extended by

The models are also extended to the standard geostatistical setting where
irregularly spaced observations are modeled using measurement errors and
covariates. A maximum likelihood estimation technique based on the Monte Carlo
Expectation Maximization (MCEM) algorithm is presented, and it is shown how the
model can be used to do predictions at unobserved locations. Finally, an
application to precipitation data over the United States for two month in 1997

applications operating around 100 K. The switch was designed to separate two
pulse tube cold heads that cool a common focal plane array. Two cold heads are
used for redundancy reasons, while the switch is used to reduce the thermal
heat loss of the stand-by cold head, thus limiting the required input power,
weight and dimensions of the cooler assembly. After initial evaluation of
possible switching technologies, a construction based on the thermal expansion
coefficient (CTE) of different materials was chosen. A simple design is
proposed based on thermoplasts which have one of the highest CTE known
permitting a relative large gap width in the open state. Furthermore, the
switch requires no power neither during normal operation nor for switching.
This enhances reliability and allows for a simple mechanical design. After a
single switch was successfully built, a second doubleswitch configuration was
designed and tested. The long term performance of the chosen thermoplast
(ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene) under cryogenic load is also
analysed.

large as the optical ring and shows a mild warp in its outer regions relative
to the inner ring. We detect two additional HI sources close in redshift to
that of Hoag's Object, and report on a newly identified SDSS optical companion
galaxy. The HI sources are ~0.3 and ~1 Mpc away in projected distance, and the
companion galaxy is also ~1 Mpc away. Our main conclusion is that the HI
detected in Hoag's Object shows no indication that this galaxy has experienced
a recent (less than ~1 Gyr ago) accretion event. At least one of the two
additional HI detected objects does not have an optical counterpart. One
possibility is that this object is an HI filament left over from an interaction
shaping Hoag's Object, in which case this interaction must also have occurred

several numbers of keys. The text entry section contains the standard character
keys, navigation section contains cursor movement and page control keys,
numeric keypad contains numeric keys and function keys section contain function
keys and special keys. Although the increased number of keys helps smooth
interaction with a computer there are situations where it is necessary to
reduce the number of keys.
  The need for reducing number of keys in a keyboard creates a technical
contradiction. Generally more number of keys can support more number of
functions and less number of keys can support less number of functions. We need
more number of functions (all the functions available in a full size keyboard),
but we want only less number of keys (Contradiction). This contradiction has
been solved by using multi-stroke mechanism.
  There may be different purposes to reduce the number of keys in a keyboard.
Some of them intend to reduce the size of the keyboard while some others intend
to increase the speed of typing. But all of these inventions use multi-stroke
mechanism to generate more number of signals from less number of keys.

We investigate the Fourier frequency dependent time lags in the light curves

flux, including simultaneous modelling of the resulting lag-frequency spectra.
We find the shape of the lag-frequency spectra to vary significantly and
systematically with source flux. We model the lag-frequency spectra using
simple transfer functions, and find that two time lag components are required,
one in each energy band. The simplest acceptable fits have only the relative
contribution of the lagged component in the hard band varying with flux level,
which can be associated with changes in the energy spectrum. We discuss the
interpretation of these results in terms of the currently popular models for
X-ray time lags.

a single isolated link, the same is not true in the presence of interference,
which is typically correlated across antennas due to the common locations of
interferers. For tractability, prior work focuses on the two extreme cases
where the interference power across antennas is either assumed to be fully
correlated or fully uncorrelated. In this paper, we address this shortcoming
and characterize the performance of MRC in the presence of spatially-correlated
interference across antennas. Modeling the interference field as a Poisson
point process, we derive the exact distribution of the signal-to-interference
ratio (SIR) for the case of two receive antennas, and upper and lower bounds
for the general case. Using these results, we study the diversity behavior of
MRC and characterize the critical density of simultaneous transmissions for a
given outage constraint. The exact SIR distribution is also useful in
benchmarking simpler correlation models. We show that the full-correlation
assumption is considerably pessimistic (up to 30% higher outage probability for
typical values) and the no-correlation assumption is significantly optimistic
compared to the true performance.

macroscopic vortex clustering and kinetic energy condensation, which we term an
Onsager-Kraichnan condensate (OKC). Damped GPE simulations reveal that such OKC

recently introduced multi-scale spacetimes (with, respectively, ordinary,

the metric structure is accompanied by an independent measure-differential
structure with the characteristics of a multi-fractal, namely, different
dimensionality at different scales and, at ultra-short distances, a discrete
symmetry known as discrete scale invariance. Under this minimal paradigm, five
general features arise: (a) the big-bang singularity can be replaced by a
finite bounce, (b) the cosmological constant problem is reinterpreted, since
accelerating phases can be mimicked by the change of geometry with the time
scale, without invoking a slowly rolling scalar field, (c) the discreteness of
geometry at Planckian scales can leave an observable imprint of logarithmic
oscillations in cosmological spectra and (d) give rise to an alternative
mechanism to inflation or (e) to a fully analytic model of cyclic mild
inflation, where near scale invariance of the perturbation spectrum can be
produced without strong acceleration. Various properties of the models and
exact dynamical solutions are discussed. In particular, the multi-scale

distribution (discounting the thermal stellar emission) peaks at high energies.
Detected from radio to TeV gamma rays, the gamma-ray binary LS I 61 303 is
highly variable across all frequencies. One aspect of this system's variability
is the modulation of its emission with the timescale set by the ~26.4960-day
orbital period. Here we show that, during the time of our observations, the
gamma-ray emission of LS I 61 303 also presents a sinusoidal variability
consistent with the previously-known superorbital period of 1667 days. This
modulation is more prominently seen at orbital phases around apastron, whereas
it does not introduce a visible change close to periastron. It is also found in
the appearance and disappearance of variability at the orbital period in the
power spectrum of the data. This behavior could be explained by a
quasi-cyclical evolution of the equatorial outflow of the Be companion star,
whose features influence the conditions for generating gamma rays. These
findings open the possibility to use gamma-ray observations to study the
outflows of massive stars in eccentric binary systems.

theoretically in the present paper. Investigations of polarized fundamental
absorption spectra demonstrated a high sensitivity to external light
illumination. The photoinduced changes were studied using the cw 532 nm green
laser with energy density about 0.4 J/cm2. The spectral maximum of the
photoinduced anisotropy was observed at spectral energies equal to about 1.4 eV
(energy gap equal to about 1.85 eV) corresponding to maximal density of the
intrinsic defect levels. Spectroscopic measurements were performed for
polarized and un-polarized photoinducing laser light to separate contribution
of the intrinsic defect states from the pure states of the valence and
conduction bands. To understand the origin of the observed photoinduced
absorption near the fundamental edge, the benchmark first-principles
calculations of the structural, electronic, optical and elastic properties of
Cu2CdGeS4 were performed in the general gradient approximation (GGA) and local
density approximation (LDA) approaches. The calculated dielectric function and
optical absorption spectra exhibit some anisotropic behavior within the
0.15...0.20 eV energy range near the absorption edge; the optical anisotropy
was also found in the deep inter-band transition spectral range. Peculiar
features of chemical bonds in Cu2CdGeS4 were revealed by studying the electron
density distribution. Possible intrinsic defects are shown to affect
considerably the optical absorption spectra. Pressure effects on the structural
and electronic properties were modeled by optimizing the crystal structure and
calculating all relevant properties at elevated hydrostatic pressure. The first
estimations of the bulk modulus (69 GPa (GGA) or 91 GPa (LDA)) and its pressure
derivative for Cu2CdGeS4 are reported.

resistance one would measure between these two nodes in an electrical network

the so-called Kirchhoff index of the graph, which measures its overall
connectivity. In this work, we consider Erdos-Renyi random graphs. Since the
graphs are random, their Kirchhoff indices are random variables. We give
formulas for the expected value of the Kirchhoff index and show it concentrates
around its expectation. We achieve this by studying the trace of the
pseudoinverse of the Laplacian of Erdos-Renyi graphs. For synchronization (a
class of estimation problems on graphs) our results imply that acquiring
pairwise measurements uniformly at random is a good strategy, even if only a
vanishing proportion of the measurements can be acquired.

Helmholtz equation in two dimensions, is extended to three dimensions for
general boundary surfaces. Although a few numerical works are available in the
literature for specific domains in three dimensions such a general analytical
prescription is presented for the first time. An appropriate transformation is
used to get rid of the asymmetries in the domain boundary by mapping the
boundary into an equivalent sphere with a deformed interior metric. The
deformed metric produces new source terms in the original homogeneous equation.
A deformation parameter measuring the deviation of the boundary from a
spherical one is introduced as a perturbative parameter. With the help of
standard Rayleigh-Schr{\""o}dinger perturbative technique the transformed
equation is solved and the general solution is written down in a closed form at
each order of perturbation. The solutions are boundary condition free and which
make them widely applicable for various situations. Once the boundary
conditions are applied to these general solutions the eigenvalues and the
wavefunctions are obtained order by order. The efficacy of the method has been
tested by comparing the analytic values against the numerical ones for three
dimensional enclosures of various shapes. The method seems to work quite well
for these shapes for both, Dirichlet as well as Neumann boundary conditions.
The usage of spherical harmonics to express the asymmetries in the boundary
surfaces helps us to consider a wide class of domains in three dimensions and
also their fast convergence guarantees the convergence of the perturbative
series for the energy. Direct applications of this method can be found in the
field of quantum dots, nuclear physics, acoustical and electromagnetic
cavities.

the feature selection, estimation and evaluation steps. This might result in
marker combinations that are only suboptimal regarding the evaluation criterion
of interest. To address this issue, we propose a unified framework to derive
and evaluate biomarker combinations. Our approach is based on the concordance
index for time-to-event data, which is a non-parametric measure to quantify the
discrimatory power of a prediction rule. Specifically, we propose a
component-wise boosting algorithm that results in linear biomarker combinations
that are optimal with respect to a smoothed version of the concordance index.
We investigate the performance of our algorithm in a large-scale simulation
study and in two molecular data sets for the prediction of survival in breast
cancer patients. Our numerical results show that the new approach is not only
methodologically sound but can also lead to a higher discriminatory power than
traditional approaches for the derivation of gene signatures.

associated with the numerical simulations of a mesoscopic system in the time
domain (i.e. beyond the single frequency AC limit). After a short review of the
state of the art, we develop a theoretical framework for the calculation of
time resolved observables in a general multiterminal system subject to an
arbitrary time dependent perturbation (oscillating electrostatic gates, voltage
pulses, time-vaying magnetic fields) The approach is mathematically equivalent
to (i) the time dependent scattering formalism, (ii) the time resolved Non
Equilibrium Green Function (NEGF) formalism and (iii) the partition-free
approach. The central object of our theory is a wave function that obeys a
simple Schrodinger equation with an additional source term that accounts for
the electrons injected from the electrodes. The time resolved observables
(current, density. . .) and the (inelastic) scattering matrix are simply
expressed in term of this wave function. We use our approach to develop a
numerical technique for simulating time resolved quantum transport. We find
that the use of this wave function is advantageous for numerical simulations
resulting in a speed up of many orders of magnitude with respect to the direct
integration of NEGF equations. Our technique allows one to simulate realistic
situations beyond simple models, a subject that was until now beyond the
simulation capabilities of available approaches.

perturbation to the shape of the bubble neck gives rise to oscillations that
increasingly distort the cross-section shape. These oscillations terminate in a
pinch-off where the bubble surface develops concave regions that contact
similar to what occurs when two liquid drops coalesce. We also present a weakly
nonlinear analysis that shows that this coalescence-like mode of pinch-off
occurs when the initial shape oscillation interferes constructively with the
higher harmonics it generates and thus reinforce each other's effects in
bringing about bubble break-up. Finally we present numerical results that
confirm the weakly nonlinear analysis scenario as well as provide insight into
observed shape reversals. They demonstrate that when the oscillations interfere
destructively, a qualitatively different mode of pinch-off results where the
cross-section profile of the bubble neck develops sharply-curved regions.

problems: symbolic matrix rank (SMR) is the problem to determine the maximum
rank among matrices in B, symbolic determinant identity testing (SDIT) is the
question to decide whether there exists a nonsingular matrix in B. The
constructive versions of these problems are asking to find a matrix of maximum

  Our first algorithm solves the constructive SMR when B is spanned by unknown

solves the constructive SDIT when B is spanned by triangularizable matrices,
but the triangularization is not given explicitly. Both algorithms work over
finite fields of size at least n+1 and over the rational numbers, and the first

Kontsevich--Katzarkov--Pantev on the periodic cyclic homology of smooth and
proper dg-algebras. The essential ingredient in the definition is the
topological realization functor from presheaves of spectra on the site of
complex affine schemes to spectra. Topological K-theory is defined as the Bott

that the topological realization of the preaheave given by nonconnective

result deals with the relation between topological K-theory of a dg-category T

K-theory can be endowed with a Chern character map to periodic cyclic homology

results. Sequences from other sources, such as externally assembled genomes and
transcriptomes, can also be incorporated in the analyses. Agalma tracks

papers, we develop and upgrade a population synthesis model as a tool to
identify the dominant physical effects and to calibrate the range of physical
conditions. Recent planet searches leads to the discovery of many
multiple-planet systems. Any theoretical models of their origins must take into
account dynamical interaction between emerging protoplanets. Here, we introduce
a prescription to approximate the close encounters between multiple planets. We
apply this method to simulate the growth, migration, and dynamical interaction
of planetary systems. Our models show that in relatively massive disks, several
gas giants and rocky/icy planets emerge, migrate, and undergo dynamical
instability. Secular perturbation between planets leads to orbital crossings,
eccentricity excitation, and planetary ejection. In disks with modest masses,
two or less gas giants form with multiple super-Earths. Orbital stability in
these systems is generally maintained and they retain the kinematic structure
after gas in their natal disks is depleted. These results reproduce the
observed planetary mass-eccentricity and semimajor axis-eccentricity
correlations. They also suggest that emerging gas giants can scatter residual
cores to the outer disk regions. Subsequent in situ gas accretion onto these
cores can lead to the formation of distant (> 30AU) gas giants with nearly
circular orbits.

the use of generalized Reed-Solomon codes in cryptography. Niederreiter was the
first to suggest an instantiation of his cryptosystem with them but Sidelnikov
and Shestakov showed that this choice is insecure. Wieschebrink proposed a
variant of the McEliece cryptosystem which consists in concatenating a few
random columns to a generator matrix of a secretly chosen generalized
Reed-Solomon code. More recently, new schemes appeared which are the
homomorphic encryption scheme proposed by Bogdanov and Lee, and a variation of
the McEliece cryptosystem proposed by Baldi et \textit{al.} which hides the
generalized Reed-Solomon code by means of matrices of very low rank.
  In this work, we show how to mount key-recovery attacks against these
public-key encryption schemes. We use the concept of distinguisher which aims
at detecting a behavior different from the one that one would expect from a
random code. All the distinguishers we have built are based on the notion of
component-wise product of codes. It results in a powerful tool that is able to
recover the secret structure of codes when they are derived from generalized
Reed-Solomon codes. Lastly, we give an alternative to Sidelnikov and Shestakov
attack by building a filtration which enables to completely recover the support
and the non-zero scalars defining the secret generalized Reed-Solomon code.

Additionally, a two-way retransmission protocol, which is a non-coherent
adaptation of the original work by Yamamoto is introduced for an additive white
Gaussian noise channel with one degree of freedom. Furthermore, the novel
protocol of a single source is extended to the dual-source case again for two
different source distributions. Asymptotic optimality of the protocols are
analyzed and upper bounds on the distortion level are derived for two-rounds
considering two extreme cases of high and low correlation among the sources. It
is shown by both the upper and lower-bounds that collaboration can be achieved
through energy accumulation. Analytical results are supported by numerical
analysis for both the single and dual-source cases to show the improvement in
terms of distortion to be gained by retransmission subject to the average
energy used by protocol . To cover a more realistic scenario, the same protocol
of a single source is adapted to a wireless channel and their performances are
compared through numerical evaluation.

  (ICRC2013), Rio de Janeiro (Brazil)",,,,"astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope (IACT) works by imaging the very
short flash of Cherenkov radiation generated by the cascade of relativistic
charged particles produced when a TeV gamma ray strikes the atmosphere. This
energetic air shower is initiated at an altitude of 10-30 km depending on the
energy and the arrival direction of the primary gamma ray. Whether the best
image of the shower is obtained by focusing the telescope at infinity and
measuring the Cherenkov photon angles or focusing on the central region of the
shower is a not obvious question. This is particularly true for large size IACT
for which the depth of the field is much smaller. We address this issue in
particular with the fifth telescope (CT5) of the High Energy Stereoscopic
System (H.E.S.S.); a 28 m dish large size telescope recently entered in
operation and sensitive to an energy threshold of tens of GeVs. CT5 is equipped
with a focus system, its working principle and the expected effect of focusing
depth on the telescope sensitivity at low energies (50-200 GeV) is discussed.

wave basis for periodic wavefunction expansions at the level of second-order
M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2). The convergence of the electronic
correlation energy with respect to the one-electron basis set is investigated
and compared to conventional MP2 theory in a finite homogeneous electron gas
model. In addition to the widely used Slater-type geminal correlation factor,
we also derive and investigate a novel correlation factor that we term
Yukawa-Coulomb. The Yukawa-Coulomb correlation factor is motivated by analytic
results for two electrons in a box and allows for a further improved
convergence of the correlation energies with respect to the employed basis set.
We find the combination of the infinitely delocalized plane waves and local
short-ranged geminals provides a complementary, and rapidly convergent basis
for the description of periodic wavefunctions. We hope that this approach will
expand the scope of discrete wavefunction expansions in periodic systems.

order to provide results for the linear heat equation $u_{t}-\Delta u-V(x)u=0$
in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with singular potentials. We show well-posedness of
solutions, without using Hardy inequality, in a framework based in the Fourier
transform, namely $PM^{k}$-spaces. For arbitrary data $u_{0}\in PM^{k}$, the
approach allows to compute an explicit smallness condition on $V$ for global
existence in the case of $V$ with finitely many inverse square singularities.
As a consequence, well-posedness of solutions is obtained for the case of the
monopolar potential $V(x)=\frac{\lambda}{\left|x\right|^{2}}$ with
$\left|\lambda\right|<\lambda_{\ast}=\frac{(n-2)^{2}}{4}$. This threshold value
is the same one obtained for the global well-posedness of $L^{2}$-solutions by
means of Hardy inequalities and energy estimates. Since there is no any
inclusion relation between $L^{2}$ and $PM^{k}$, our results indicate that
$\lambda_{\ast}$ is intrinsic of the PDE and independent of a particular
approach. We also analyze the long time behavior of solutions and show there
are infinitely many possible asymptotics characterized by the cells of a
disjoint partition of the initial data class $PM^{k}$.

nonequilibrium external noise. This allows to infer the transport properties of
the system under active measurements from the transient behavior obtained from
passive measurements, extending the connection between active and passive
microrheology to the nonequilibrium regime. The active and passive results can
be linked via a generalized Stokes-Einstein relation based on an effective
time-dependent temperature, which can be determined from the transient passive

still exhibiting strong collective rotational character. We compare with
cluster models and discuss concepts of rotations in the continuum in connection
with central quantities as transition probabilities, inelastic cross sections

discuss properties of this possible continuation of the band beyond the known

the degree of compaction is a delicate balance between the strength of the
electrostatic interaction and the elasticity of DNA. We report various elastic
properties of short double stranded DNA (dsDNA) and the effect of dendrimer
binding using fully atomistic molecular dynamics and numerical simulations. In
equilibrium at room temperature, the contour length distribution P(L) and
end-to-end distance distribution P(R) are nearly Gaussian, the former gives an
estimate of the stretch modulus {\gamma}_1 of dsDNA in quantitative agreement
with the literature value. The bend angle distribution P({\theta}) of the dsDNA
also has a Gaussian form and allows to extract a persistence length, L_p of 43
nm. When the dsDNA is compacted by positively charged dendrimer, the stretch
modulus stays invariant but the effective bending rigidity estimated from the
end-to-end distance distribution decreases dramatically due to backbone charge
neutralization of dsDNA by dendrimer. We support our observations with
numerical solutions of the worm-like-chain (WLC) model as well as using
non-equilibrium dsDNA stretching simulations. These results are helpful in
understanding the dsDNA elasticity at short length scales as well as how the
elasticity is modulated when dsDNA binds to a charged object such as a
dendrimer or protein.

power-law, in sharp contrast with non-active granular systems. We discuss some

complex dust structure and ongoing star formation. New high-bandwidth and
high-resolution data of the RCW49 field were obtained to survey the radio
emission at arcsec scale and investigate the small-scale features and nature of
the HII region.- Data were collected with the new 2-GHz bandwidth receivers and
the CABB correlator of the ATCA, at 5.5 and 9.0 GHz. In addition, archival
observations at 1.4 and 2.4 GHz have been re-reduced and re-analyzed, together
with optical, IR, X-ray, and gamma-ray observations.- The CABB data result in
the most detailed radio continuum images of RCW49 to date. The radio emission
closely mimics the near-IR emission observed by Spitzer, showing pillars and
filaments. The brightest continuum emission comes from the region known as the
bridge. The overall flattish spectral index is consistent with a free-free
emission mechanism. However, hints of nonthermal components are also present in
the bridge. A jet-like structure surrounded by a bubble feature whose nature is
still unclear has been discovered close to the Westerlund~2 core. Two apparent
bow shocks and a number of discrete sources have been detected as well in the
surroundings of RCW49. We also report on and discuss the possible detection of
a H RRL.- The radio results support an association between the cm continuum and
molecular emission. The detection of the RRL kinematically favors a RCW49
distance of 6--7 kpc. If the negative spectral indices measured at the bridge
are caused by synchrotron emission, we propose a scenario where high-energy
emission could be produced. Finally, the newly discovered jet-like structure
appears to deserve a detailed study by itself.

complexity, chaos. Given limited data, predictability of such time series
becomes hard to infer. While efficient methods of Lyapunov exponent computation
are devised, knowledge about the process driving the dynamics greatly
facilitates the complexity analysis. This paper shows that quarterly inventory
changes of wheat in the global market, during 1974-2012, follow a nonlinear
deterministic process. Lyapunov exponents of these fluctuations are computed
using sliding time windows each of length 131 quarters. Weakly chaotic behavior
alternates with non-chaotic behavior over the entire period of analysis. More
importantly, in this paper, a cubic dependence of price changes on inventory
changes leads to establishment of deterministic Duffing-Oscillator-Model(DOM)
as a suitable candidate for examining inventory fluctuations of wheat. DOM
represents the interaction of commodity production cycle with an external
intervention in the market. Parameters obtained for shifting time zones by
fitting the Fourier estimated time signals to DOM are able to generate
responses that reproduce the true chaotic nature exhibited by the empirical
signal at that time. Endowing the parameters with suitable meanings, one may
infer that temporary changes in speculation reflect the pattern of inventory
volatility that drives the transitions between chaotic and non-chaotic
behavior.

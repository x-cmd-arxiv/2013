iron-rich Keplerian ring (a few stellar radii away). AXP bursts are caused by
accretion of chunks from the inner edge of the ring following magnetic field
penetration. For bright bursts, the inner disk is prone to radiation induced
warping which can tilt it into counter-rotation (i.e. retrograde). For AXP
1E2259+586, the 2002 burst satisfies the condition for the formation of a
retrograde inner ring. We hypothesize the 2002 burst reversed the inner ring
setting the scene for the 2012 outburst and ""anti-glitch"" when the retrograde
inner ring was suddenly accreted leading to the basic observed properties of
the 2012 event.

categories. As we know, it is extremely difficult and expensive to obtain gene
expression labelled examples. Moreover, conventional supervised approaches
cannot function properly when labelled data (training examples) are
insufficient using Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithms. Therefore, in this
paper, we suggest Transductive Support Vector Machines (TSVMs) as
semi-supervised learning algorithms, learning with both labelled samples data
and unlabelled samples to perform the classification of microarray data. To
prune the superfluous genes and samples we used a feature selection method
called Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), which is supposed to enhance the
output of classification and avoid the local optimization problem. We examined
the classification prediction accuracy of the TSVM-RFE algorithm in comparison
with the Genetic Learning Across Datasets (GLAD) algorithm, as both are
semi-supervised learning methods. Comparing these two methods, we found that
the TSVM-RFE surpassed both a SVM using RFE and GLAD.

the merits of those unique properties of the DCA that are yet to be thoroughly

simply creating a new algorithm. This work examines the dynamic filtering

Temperature and humidity are two of the most important driving forces of
precipitation, and the strategy is to have a stochastic model for temperature
and humidity, and use a deterministic model to go from these variables to
precipitation. Temperature and humidity are empirically positively correlated.
Generally speaking, if variables are empirically dependent, then multivariate
models should be considered. In this work we model humidity and temperature in
southern Norway. We want to construct bivariate Gaussian random fields (GRFs)
based on this dataset. The aim of our work is to use the bivariate GRFs to
capture both the dependence structure between humidity and temperature as well
as their spatial dependencies. One important feature for the dataset is that
the humidity and temperature are not necessarily observed at the same
locations. Both univariate and bivariate spatial models are fitted and
compared. For modeling and inference the SPDE approach for univariate models
and the systems of SPDEs approach for multivariate models have been used.
  To evaluate the performance of the difference between the univariate and
bivariate models, we compare predictive performance using some commonly used
scoring rules: mean absolute error, mean-square error and continuous ranked
probability score. The results illustrate that we can capture strong positive
correlation between the temperature and the humidity. Furthermore, the results
also agree with the physical or empirical knowledge. At the end, we conclude
that using the bivariate GRFs to model this dataset is superior to the approach
with independent univariate GRFs both when evaluating point predictions and for
quantifying prediction uncertainty.

optimal estimation retrieval method to include a phenomenological model of
clouds that requires the cloud optical depth and monodisperse particle size to
be specified. Previous studies have focused on forward models with assumed

highly dispersed millisecond radio pulse. The pulses do not repeat and are not
associated with a known pulsar or gamma-ray burst. The high dispersion suggests
sources at cosmological distances, hence implying an extremely high radio
luminosity, far larger than the power of single pulses from a pulsar. We
suggest that a fast radio burst represents the final signal of a supramassive
rotating neutron star that collapses to a black hole due to magnetic braking.
The neutron star is initially above the critical mass for non-rotating models
and is supported by rapid rotation. As magnetic braking constantly reduces the
spin, the neutron star will suddenly collapse to a black hole several thousand
to million years after its birth. We discuss several formation scenarios for
supramassive neutron stars and estimate the possible observational signatures
{making use of the results of recent numerical general-relativistic
calculations. While the collapse will hide the stellar surface behind an event
horizon, the magnetic-field lines will snap violently. This can turn an almost
ordinary pulsar into a bright radio ""blitzar"": Accelerated electrons from the
travelling magnetic shock dissipate a significant fraction of the magnetosphere
and produce a massive radio burst that is observable out to z>0.7. Only a few
percent of the neutron stars needs to be supramassive in order to explain the
observed rate. We suggest that fast radio bursts might trace the solitary
formation of stellar mass black holes at high redshifts. These bursts could be
an electromagnetic complement to gravitational-wave emission and reveal a new
formation and evolutionary channel for black holes that are not seen as
gamma-ray bursts. Radio observations of these bursts could trace the
core-collapse supernova rate throughout the universe.

the viewpoint, different C$^*$-algebraic compact quantum groups are produced,

that a complicated range of behaviours, with C$^*$-completions between the

answering a question of So{\l}tan. We also study such compactifications from
the perspective of (almost) periodic functions. We give a definition of a

one to compute the Hopf $*$-algebra of the compactification of $\mathbb G$; we

string processing problems for both linguistic texts and biological data. It
has been introduced as a memory efficient alternative for suffix trees. The
suffix array consists of the sorted suffixes of a string. There are several
linear time suffix array construction algorithms (SACAs) known in the
literature. However, one of the fastest algorithms in practice has a worst case
run time of $O(n^2)$. The problem of designing practically and theoretically
efficient techniques remains open. In this paper we present an elegant
algorithm for suffix array construction which takes linear time with high
probability; the probability is on the space of all possible inputs. Our
algorithm is one of the simplest of the known SACAs and it opens up a new
dimension of suffix array construction that has not been explored until now.
Our algorithm is easily parallelizable. We offer parallel implementations on
various parallel models of computing. We prove a lemma on the $\ell$-mers of a
random string which might find independent applications. We also present
another algorithm that utilizes the above algorithm. This algorithm is called
RadixSA and has a worst case run time of $O(n\log{n})$. RadixSA introduces an
idea that may find independent applications as a speedup technique for other
SACAs. An empirical comparison of RadixSA with other algorithms on various
datasets reveals that our algorithm is one of the fastest algorithms to date.

model corrected with anisotropies. This approximation is valid in the
high-energy sector of the FRW geometry (concerning its contribution to the
constraint) and for anisotropy profiles that are sufficiently smooth. In
addition, for certain families of states associated to regimes of physical
interest, with negligible effects of the anisotropies and small
inhomogeneities, one can approximate the Hamiltonian constraint of the
inhomogeneous system by that of an FRW geometry with a relatively simple matter
content, and then obtain its solutions.

been a requisite and computationally intensive step in many diverse
applications, including text indexing and data compression. Many algorithms for
LZ77 parsing have been discovered over the years; however, despite the
increasing need to apply LZ77 to massive data sets, no algorithm to date scales
to inputs that exceed the size of internal memory. In this paper we describe
the first algorithm for computing the LZ77 parsing in external memory. Our

Effect Transistor (FET) with S=0 corresponding to abrupt switching
characteristics. While thermodynamics dictates S to be greater than or equal to
60mV/dec for classical FETs, ""Landau switches"" use inherently unstable gate
insulators to achieve abrupt switching. Unfortunately, S=0 switching is always
achieved at the expense of an intrinsic hysteresis, making these switches
unsuitable for low-power applications. The fundamental question therefore
remains: Under what condition, hysteresis-free abrupt switching can be achieved
in a Landau switch? In this paper, we first provide an intuitive classification
of all charge based switches in terms of their energy landscapes and identify
two-well energy landscape as the characteristic feature of Landau switches. We
then use nanoelectromechanical field effect transistor (NEMFET) as an
illustrative example of a Landau switch and conclude that a flat energy
landscape is essential for hysteresis-free abrupt switching. In contrast, a
hysteresis-free smooth sub-60mV/dec switching is obtained by stabilizing the
unstable gate insulator in its unstable regime. Our conclusions have broad
implications and may considerably simplify the design of next charge based
logic switch.

illuminations with sufficient density, which follows from a new perturbation
bound for point images in the Lambertian model. As the number of point images

$\psi_\mu\longrightarrow \left[(1/2,1)\oplus (1,1/2)\right]\oplus

sectors, the first one transforming as a genuine Dirac-spinor, $(1/2,0)\oplus

freedom in the Rarita-Schwinger field of interest we exploit the properties of
the Casimir invariants of the Lorentz algebra to distinguish between the
irreducible Dirac- and $(1/2,1)\oplus (1,1/2)$ representation spaces and
construct corresponding momentum-independent (static) projectors which we then
combine with a dynamical spin-1/2 Poincar\'e covariant projector. In so doing
we obtain two spin-1/2 wave equation, and prove them to be causal within an
electromagnetic field. We furthermore calculate Compton scattering off each one
of the above states, and find that the amplitudes corresponding to the first
spin-1/2 are identical to those of a Dirac particle and conclude on the
observability of this state. Also for the second spin-1/2 we find finite cross
sections in all directions in the ultra-relativistic limit, and conclude that
its observability is not excluded neither by causality of propagation within an
electromagnetic environment, nor by unitarity of the Compton scattering
amplitudes in the ultraviolet. Finally, we notice that the method of the

opening a new avenue toward the consistent description of any spin by means of
second order Lagrangians written in terms of sufficiently large reducible

paper starts addressing the distributed estimation problem. We show first an

case where the estimation is performed at a fusion center, showing how to
allocate quantization bits and transmit powers in the links between the nodes

transmit power. Then, we generalize consensus algorithms illustrating a
distributed procedure that converges to the projection of the observation
vector onto a signal subspace. We then address the issue of energy consumption

We suggest that these TeV-PeV non-atmospheric neutrinos may originate from two
groups of sources, motivated by the non-detection of neutrinos in the energy
range 250 TeV- 1 PeV in current data. If intrinsic, the non-detection of 250
TeV-1 PeV neutrinos disfavors the single power-law spectrum model for the
TeV-PeV non-atmospheric neutrinos at a confidence level of ~ 2\sigma. We then
interpret the current neutrino data with a two-component spectrum model. One
has a flat spectrum with a cutoff at the energy ~ 250 TeV and the other has a
sharp peak at ~1 PeV. The former is likely via pp collision while the latter
may be generated by the photomeson interaction.

obtained using the Kwee-Zhang-Krakauer (KZK) functional in density functional

In the static approximation, our DMC simulations indicate a transition from the
insulating Cmca-12 structure to the metallic Cmca structure at around 375 GPa.
The $GW$ band gap of Cmca-12 closes at roughly the same pressure. In the
dynamic DMC phase diagram, which includes the effects of zero-point energy, the
Cmca-12 structure remains stable up to 430 GPa, well above the pressure at
which the $GW$ band gap closes. Our results predict that the semimetallic state
observed experimentally at around 360 GPa [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 108}, 146402

band gap closes. The dynamic DMC phase diagram indicates that the hexagonal
close packed $P6_3/m$ structure, which has the largest band gap of the

Milky Way have suggested a variety of star formation laws, i.e., simple direct
relations between the column density of star formation (Sigma_SFR: the amount
of gas forming stars per unit area and time) and the column density of
available gas (Sigma_gas). Extending previous studies, we show that these
different, sometimes contradictory relations for Milky Way clouds, nearby
galaxies, and high-redshift discs and starbursts can be combined in one
universal star formation law in which Sigma_SFR is about 1% of the local gas
collapse rate, Sigma_gas/t_ff, but a significant scatter remains in this

observed scatter may be primarily controlled by physical variations in the Mach
number of the turbulence and by differences in the star formation efficiency.
Secondary variations can be induced by changes in the virial parameter,
turbulent driving and magnetic field. The predictions of our models are
testable with observations that constrain both the Mach number and the star
formation efficiency in Milky Way clouds, external disc and starburst galaxies
at low and high redshift. We also find that reduced telescope resolution does
not strongly affect such measurements when Sigma_SFR is plotted against

which dissolve over time so that the members become part of the disc and halo
populations of the Galaxy. In the present work we will assume that these young
stellar clusters live mainly within the disc of the Galaxy and that they can
have primordial binary percentages ranging from 0% to as high as 70%. We have
evolved models of such clusters to an age of 4 Gyr through N-body simulations,
paying attention to the stars and binaries that escape in the process. We have
quantified the contribution of these escaping stars to the Galaxy population by
analysing their escape velocity and evolutionary stage at the moment of escape.
In this way we could analyse the mechanisms that produced these escapers,
whether evaporation through weak two- body encounters, energetic close
encounters or stellar evolution events, e.g. supernovae. In our models we found
that the percentage of primordial binaries in a star cluster does not produce
significant variations in the velocities of the stars that escape in the
velocity range of 0-20 km/s. However, in the high-velocity 20-100 km/s range
the number of escapers increased markedly as the primordial binary percentage
increased. We could also infer that dissolving stellar clusters such as those
that we have modelled can populate the Galactic halo with giant stars for which
the progenitors were stars of up to 2.4 Msun. Furthermore, choices made for the
velocity kicks of remnants do influence the production of hyper-velocity stars
- and to a lesser extent stars in the high-velocity range - but once again the
difference for the 99% of stars in the 0-20 km/s range is not significant.

for maximum stability and minimum noise. The InGaAs dark current halves with
every 7 deg C of cooling, and we reduce it to 840 e-/s/pixel (with a
pixel-to-pixel variation of +/-200 e-/s/pixel) by cooling the array to -20 deg
C. Beyond this point, glow from the readout dominates. The single-sample read
noise of 149 e- is reduced to 54 e- through up-the-ramp sampling. Laboratory
testing with a star field generated by a lenslet array shows that 2-star
differential photometry is possible to a precision of 631 +/-205 ppm (0.68
mmag) hr^-0.5 at a flux of 2.4E4 e-/s. Employing three comparison stars and
de-correlating reference signals further improves the precision to 483 +/-161

ppm (0.45 mmag) hr^-0.5 is achieved with an effective telescope aperture of
0.25 m. Next-generation InGaAs detectors should indeed enable Poisson-limited
photometry of brighter dwarfs with particular advantage for late-M and L types.
In addition, one might acquire near-infrared photometry simultaneously with
optical photometry or radial velocity measurements to maximize the return of
exoplanet searches with small telescopes.

within a 2{\sigma} error circle of 80 mas (8.7 pc). The candidate has a MB
luminosity of -5.2 +/- 0.4 mag and a B-I color of 0.1+/-0.3 mag. If confirmed
by future observations, this would be the first direct detection for a
progenitor of a Type Ib. Fitting a power law to the early light curve, we find
an extrapolated explosion date around 1.1 days before our first detection. We
see no evidence of shock cooling. The pre-explosion detection limits constrain
the radius of the progenitor to be smaller than a few solar radii. iPTF13bvn is
also detected in cm and mm-wavelengths. Fitting a synchrotron self-absorption
model to our radio data, we find a mass loading parameter of 1.3*10^12 g/cm.
Assuming a wind velocity of 10^3km/s, we derive a progenitor mass loss rate of
3*10^-5Msun/yr. Our observations, taken as a whole, are consistent with a Wolf
Rayet progenitor of the supernova iPTF13bvn.

are proving rather elusive in surveys of distant galaxies, including those at
X-ray energies. Our main goal is to determine whether the revised IRAC criteria
of Donley et al. (2012) (objects with an IR power-law spectral shape), are
effective at selecting X-ray type-2 AGN. We present the results from the X-ray
spectral analysis of 147 AGN selected by cross-correlating the highest spectral
quality ultra-deep XMM-Newton and the Spitzer/IRAC catalogues in the CDF-S.
Consequently it is biased towards sources with high S/N X-ray spectra. In order
to measure the amount of intrinsic absorption in these sources, we adopt a
simple X-ray spectral model that includes a power-law modified by intrinsic
absorption and a possible soft X-ray component. We find 21/147 sources to be
heavily absorbed but the uncertainties in their obscuring column densities do
not allow us to confirm their Compton-Thick nature without resorting to
additional criteria. Although IR power-law galaxies are less numerous in our
sample than IR non-power-law galaxies (60 versus 87 respectively), we find that
the fraction of absorbed (N_{H} > 10^{22} cm^{-2}) AGN is significantly higher
(at about 3 sigma level) for IR-power-law sources ($\sim$2/3) than for those
sources that do not meet this IR selection criteria ($\sim$1/2). This behaviour
is particularly notable at low luminosities, but it appears to be present,
although with a marginal significance, at all luminosities. We therefore
conclude that the IR power-law method is efficient in finding X-ray-absorbed
sources. We would then expect that the long-sought dominant population of
absorbed AGN is abundant among IR power-law spectral shape sources not detected
in X-rays.

neutral atomic absorption lines at 5895A (NaD) and 8190A that are deeper than
expected based on stellar population models. van Dokkum & Conroy proposed that
low-mass stars are more prevalent in massive early-type galaxies, which may
lead to a strong NaI8190 line strength. It is, however, necessary to test this
prediction against other prominent line indices in optical wavelengths. We
newly identified roughly a thousand NaD excess objects (NEOs) based on the NaD
line strength in the redshift range 0.00<z<0.08 from the SDSS DR7. The novelty
of this work is that galaxies were carefully identified through direct visual
inspection of SDSS images, and we systematically compared the properties of
NEOs and those of a control sample of normal galaxies. Note that the majority
of galaxies with high velocity dispersion (>250km/s) show NaD excess. Most
late-type NEOs have strong Hb line strengths and significant emission lines.
This implies that the presence of ISM and/or dust contributes to the increase
in NaD line strengths observed for these galaxies. In contrast, the majority of
early-type NEOs are predominantly luminous and massive systems. However, we
find that models used to reproduce the NaI8190 line strengths that adopt a
bottom-heavy IMF are not able to reproduce the observed NaD line strengths. By
comparing the observed NaD, Mgb and Fe5270 line strengths with those of the
models, we identify a plausible range of parameters. In these models, the
majority of early-type NEOs are alpha-enhanced ([a/Fe]~0.3), metal-rich
([Z/H]~0.3) and especially Na-enhanced ([Na/Fe]~0.3). Enhanced Na abundance is
a particularly compelling hypothesis for the increase in the strength of the
NaD line index in our early-type NEOs that appear devoid of dust, both in their
SDSS images and spectra.

line widths, and absence of embedded IR sources (from 3.6 to 70 mu) indicate
that the clump is likely prestellar. Strong SiO emission with broad line widths
(6-9 km s^-1) and high abundances (0.8-4 x 10^-9) is detected in the northern

released to the gas phase from the dust grains through shocks produced by
outflows from undetected intermediate-mass stars or clusters of low-mass stars
deeply embedded in the IRDC. A weaker SiO component with narrow line widths (~2
km s^-1) and low abundances (4.3 x 10^-11) is detected in the center-west

population of a few low-mass stars. We report widespread CH_3OH emission
throughout the whole IRDC and the first detection of extended narrow methanol
emission (~2 km s^-1) in a cold, massive prestellar clump (MM1). We suggest
that the most likely mechanism releasing methanol into the gas phase in such a
cold region is the exothermicity of grain-surface reactions. HN^13C reveals
that the IRDC is actually composed of two distinct substructures (""subclouds"")
separated in velocity space by ~1.4 km s^-1. The narrow SiO component arises
where the subclouds overlap. The spatial distribution of C_2H resembles that of
NH_2D, which suggests that C_2H also traces cold gas in this IRDC.

fully sample the range in star formation rates (SFRs) occupied by the

Using the Doppler shifts of the MgII and FeII absorption lines as tracers of

HST/ACS imaging and our spectral analysis indicate that the outflow detection
rate depends primarily on galaxy orientation: winds are detected in ~89% of
galaxies having inclinations (i) <30 degrees (face-on), while the wind
detection rate is only ~45% in objects having i>50 degrees (edge-on). Combined
with the comparatively weak dependence of the wind detection rate on intrinsic
galaxy properties, this suggests that biconical outflows are ubiquitous in
normal, star-forming galaxies at z~0.5. We find that the wind velocity is
correlated with host galaxy M_* at 3.4-sigma significance, while the equivalent
width of the flow is correlated with host galaxy SFR at 3.5-sigma significance,
suggesting that hosts with higher SFR may launch more material into outflows
and/or generate a larger velocity spread for the absorbing clouds. Assuming
that the gas is launched into dark matter halos with simple, isothermal density
profiles, the wind velocities measured for the bulk of the cool material
(~200-400 km/s) are sufficient to enable escape from the halo potentials only
for the lowest-M_* systems in the sample. However, the outflows typically carry
sufficient energy to reach distances of >50 kpc, and may therefore be a viable
source of cool material for the massive circumgalactic medium observed around
bright galaxies at z~0. [abridged]

p-wave Hamiltonian, which we establish via a Lax construction. Three different
types of behavior can occur depending upon the strength and direction of the
quench. In phase I, the order parameter asymptotes to zero. In phase II,
\Delta(t) goes to a non-zero constant. Phase III is characterized by persistent
oscillations of \Delta(t). For quenches within I and II, we determine the
topological character of the asymptotic states. We show that two different
formulations of the bulk topological winding number, although equivalent in the
ground state, must be regarded as independent out of equilibrium. The first
number Q characterizes the Anderson pseudospin texture of the initial state; we
show that it is conserved. For non-zero Q, this leads to the prediction of a
""gapless topological"" state when \Delta(t) goes to zero. The presence or
absence of Majorana edge modes in a sample with a boundary is encoded in the
second winding number W, formulated in terms of the retarded Green's function.
We show that W can change following a quench across the quantum critical point.
We discuss the implications for the (dis)appearance of Majorana edge modes.
Finally, we show that the parity of zeros in the bulk out-of-equilibrium Cooper
pair distribution function constitutes a Z2-valued quantum number, which is
non-zero whenever W differs from Q. The pair distribution can in principle be
measured using RF spectroscopy in an ultracold atom realization, allowing
direct experimental detection of the bulk Z2 number.

to the low-energy electron recoils that would be induced by solar or dark

axion-induced electron recoils down to 2.5 keV within four scenarios involving
different hypotheses on the origin and couplings of axions. We set a 95% CL
limit on the coupling to photons $g_{A\gamma}<2.13\times 10^{-9}$ GeV$^{-1}$ in
a mass range not fully covered by axion helioscopes. We also constrain the
coupling to electrons, $g_{Ae} < 2.56\times 10^{-11}$, similar to the more
indirect solar neutrino bound. Finally we place a limit on $g_{Ae}\times
g_{AN}^{\rm eff}<4.70 \times 10^{-17}$, where $g_{AN}^{\rm eff}$ is the
effective axion-nucleon coupling for $^{57}$Fe. Combining these results we
fully exclude the mass range $0.91\,{\rm eV}<m_A<80$ keV for DFSZ axions and
$5.73\,{\rm eV}<m_A<40$ keV for KSVZ axions.

a vector ${\bf \Omega}$ which has four possible orientations which correspond
to different domains of order in a perfect sample. Since translational symmetry
remains unchanged in the pure limit, no gap occurs at the chemical potential.
On the other hand Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) has revealed that the
magnitude of the pseudo-gap in under-doped cuprates varies spatially and is
correlated with disorder. For disorder coupling also to the direction of ${\bf
\Omega}$, there can only be a finite temperature dependent static correlation
length for the loop-current state below the ordering temperature of the pure
problem. It is shown that, in this situation, singular forward scattering of
fermions for large correlation lengths induces an angle dependent pseudo-gap in
the single-particle spectral function near the chemical potential. The peaks in
the spectral function at the fermi-vectors are away from the chemical potential
proportionally to the square of the average loop order parameter measurable by
polarized neutron scattering. This result is tested. Due to the finite
correlation length there always exist low frequency excitations at long
wavelength at all temperatures in the ""ordered"" phase. Such fluctuations
motionally average over the shifts in frequencies of local probes such as NMR

Although cancer patient survivability was reported to correlate with the
heterogeneous connectivity of the signaling networks inspired by theoretical
studies on the increase of network robustness due to the heterogeneous
connectivity, other theoretical and data analytic studies suggest an
alternative explanation: the impact of modular organization of networks on
biological robustness or adaptation to changing environments. In this study,
thus, we evaluate whether the modularity--robustness hypothesis is applicable
to cancer using network analysis. We focus on 14 specific cancer types whose
molecular signaling networks are available in databases, and show that modular
organization of cancer signaling networks is associated with the patient
survival rate. In particular, the cancers with less modular signaling networks
are more curable. This result is consistent with a prediction from the
modularity--robustness hypothesis. Furthermore, we show that the network
modularity is a better descriptor of the patient survival rate than the
heterogeneous connectivity. However, these results do not contradict the
importance of the heterogeneous connectivity. Rather, they provide new and
different insights into the relationship between cellular networks and cancer
behaviors. Despite several limitations of data analysis, these findings enhance
our understanding of adaptive and evolutionary mechanisms of cancer cells.

let $\varphi : H\rightarrow \R$ is such that $D^2\varphi$ is bounded on $H$ but
not necessarily bounded and suppose in addition that either its first

area network (WLAN) system that jointly exploits physical-layer network coding

multiple access mode as Network-Coded Multiple Access (NCMA). Prior studies on
PNC mostly focused on relay networks. NCMA is the first realized multiple
access scheme that establishes the usefulness of PNC in a non-relay setting.
NCMA allows multiple nodes to transmit simultaneously to the access point (AP)
to boost throughput. In the non-relay setting, when two nodes A and B transmit
to the AP simultaneously, the AP aims to obtain both packet A and packet B
rather than their network-coded packet. An interesting question is whether
network coding, specifically PNC which extracts packet (A XOR B), can still be
useful in such a setting. We provide an affirmative answer to this question
with a novel two-layer decoding approach amenable to real-time implementation.
Our USRP prototype indicates that NCMA can boost throughput by 100% in the
medium-high SNR regime (>=10dB). We believe further throughput enhancement is
possible by allowing more than two users to transmit together.

heterogeneous patterns in soft matter. In this Lecture Note we show that phase
separation in these materials generally belongs to what we call ""viscoelastic
phase separation"", where the morphology is determined by the mechanical balance
of not only the thermodynamic force (interface tension) but also the
viscoelastic force. The origin of the viscoelastic force is dynamic asymmetry
between the components of a mixture, which can be caused by either a size
disparity or a difference in the glass transition temperature between the
components. We stress that such dynamic asymmetry generally exists in soft
matter. The key is that dynamical asymmetry leads to a non-trivial coupling
between the concentration, velocity, and stress fields. Viscoelastic phase
separation can be explained by viscoelastic relaxation in pattern evolution and
the resulting switching of the relevant order parameter, which are induced by
the competition between the deformation rate of phase separation and the
slowest mechanical relaxation rate of a system. We also discuss an intimate
link of viscoelastic phase separation, where deformation fields are
spontaneously generated by phase separation itself, to mechanical instability
(or fracture) of glassy material, which is induced by externally imposed strain
fields. We propose that all these phenomena can be understood as
mechanically-driven inhomogeneization in a unified manner.

wave-functions of extended quantum many-body systems on a lattice. In a tensor
network N, the dimension \chi of the bond indices that connect its tensors
controls the number of variational parameters and associated computational
costs. In the absence of any symmetry, the minimal bond dimension \chi^{min}
required to represent a given many-body wave-function |\Psi> leads to the most
compact, computationally efficient tensor network description of |\Psi>. In the
presence of a global, on-site symmetry, one can use a tensor network N_{sym}
made of symmetric tensors. Symmetric tensors allow to exactly preserve the
symmetry and to target specific quantum numbers, while their sparse structure
leads to a compact description and lowers computational costs. In this paper we
explore the trade-off between using a tensor network N with minimal bond
dimension \chi^{min} and a tensor network N_{sym} made of symmetric tensors,
where the minimal bond dimension \chi^{min}_{sym} might be larger than
\chi^{min}. We present two technical results. First, we show that in a tree
tensor network, which is the most general tensor network without loops, the
minimal bond dimension can always be achieved with symmetric tensors, so that
\chi^{min}_{sym} = \chi^{min}. Second, we provide explicit examples of tensor
networks with loops where replacing tensors with symmetric ones necessarily
increases the bond dimension, so that \chi_{sym}^{min} > \chi^{min}. We further
argue, however, that in some situations there are important conceptual reasons
to prefer a tensor network representation with symmetric tensors (and possibly
larger bond dimension) over one with minimal bond dimension.

investigate the achievable phase sensitivity of the simple and efficient single

show that the Holland-Burnett state is optimal. We experimentally demonstrate

OFF and allowed to recharge while nearby users are served by neighboring BSs
that are ON. We show that the fraction of time a k^{th} tier BS can be kept ON,
termed availability \rho_k, is a fundamental metric of interest. Using tools
from random walk theory, fixed point analysis and stochastic geometry, we
characterize the set of K-tuples (\rho_1, \rho_2, ... \rho_K), termed the

strategies, where the decision to toggle the current ON/OFF state of a BS is
taken independently of the other BSs. If the availability vector corresponding
to the optimal system performance, e.g., in terms of rate, lies in this

unreliable energy sources. As a part of our analysis, we model the temporal

performance in wireless random-access networks. Focusing on regular meshes as
prototypical scenarios, we show that the mean delays in an $L\times L$ toric
grid with normalized load $\rho$ are of the order $(\frac{1}{1-\rho})^L$. This
superlinear delay scaling is to be contrasted with the usual linear growth of
the order $\frac{1}{1-\rho}$ in conventional queueing networks. The intuitive
explanation for the poor delay characteristics is that (i) high load requires a
high activity factor, (ii) a high activity factor implies extremely slow
transitions between dominant activity states, and (iii) slow transitions cause
starvation and hence excessively long queues and delays. Our proof method
combines both renewal and conductance arguments. A critical ingredient in
quantifying the long transition times is the derivation of the communication
height of the uniformized Markov chain associated with the activity process. We
also discuss connections with Glauber dynamics, conductance and mixing times.
Our proof framework can be applied to other topologies as well, and is also
relevant for the hard-core model in statistical physics and the sampling from
independent sets using single-site update Markov chains.

services as well as advances in Web and mobile technologies clearly changed the
meaning behind ""browsing the Web"" and require a fresh look at the problem and
research, specifically in respect to whether the used models are still
appropriate. Platforms such as YouTube, Netflix or last.fm have started to
replace the traditional media channels (cinema, television, radio) and media
distribution formats (CD, DVD, Blu-ray). Social networks (e.g., Facebook) and
platforms for browser games attracted whole new, particularly less tech-savvy
audiences. Furthermore, advances in mobile technologies and devices made
browsing ""on-the-move"" the norm and changed the user behavior as in the mobile
case browsing is often being influenced by the user's location and context in
the physical world. Commonly used datasets, such as web server access logs or
search engines transaction logs, are inherently not capable of capturing the

anonymous and privacy-preserving way. To this end, DOBBS provides a browser
add-on that users can install, which keeps track of their browsing behavior
(e.g., how much time they spent on the Web, how long they stay on a website,
how often they visit a website, how they use their browser, etc.). In this

straightforward - through a spatial location and vicinity at a certain point in

transport is investigated theoretically and experimentally by imaging the spin
polarization profile as a function of distance from a tightly-focussed light
excitation spot. Under degeneracy of the electron gas (high concentration, low
temperature), a dip at the center of the polarization profile appears with a
polarization maximum at a distance of about $2 \; \mu m$ from the center. This
counterintuitive result reveals that photoelectron diffusion depends on spin,
as a direct consequence of the Pauli principle. This causes a concentration
dependence of the spin stiffness while the spin dependence of the mobility is
found to be weak in doped material. The various effects which can modify spin
transport in a degenerate electron gas under local laser excitation are
considered. A comparison of the data with a numerical solution of the coupled
diffusion equations reveals that ambipolar coupling with holes increases the
steady-state photo-electron density at the excitation spot and therefore the
amplitude of the degeneracy-induced polarization dip. Thermoelectric currrents
are predicted to depend on spin under degeneracy (spin Soret currents), but
these currents are negligible except at very high excitation power where they
play a relatively small role. Coulomb spin drag and bandgap renormalization are
negligible due to electrostatic screening by the hole gas.

close to the sum of the neutralino mass and the top quark mass. In this
scenario, the top quark and the neutralino coming from the decay of a stop have
almost equal velocity vectors, and hence the missing transverse momentum in
stop pair production events at colliders is suppressed, which makes the stop
search challenging, as in the degenerate scenario where the stop mass and the
neutralino mass are nearby. In this paper, we propose a novel analysis
technique aiming at discovering the stop pair production signal in such an
`equal-velocity' scenario. The key is to look for events where the missing
transverse momentum vector is proportional to the transverse momentum vector of
the top quark pair with specific values for the proportionality coefficient, as
this coefficient equals to the ratio of the neutralino mass over the top quark
mass in the equal-velocity limit. We examine the possibility that the stop

the direct amplitude and the complex conjugate amplitude. This functional
equation can be used to derive ordinary evolution equations for the

useful in practice, including in the limit where the number of colors is large.
To circumvent this problem, we propose an alternative formulation of the
high-energy evolution as a Langevin process, which is better suited for
numerical implementations. This process is directly oriented towards the
calculation of the cross-sections, so its detailed structure depends upon the

phase configurations), of the stress (and the displacement), and of the
absolute temperature. The resulting equations present several technical
difficulties to be tackled: in particular, we emphasize the presence of
nonlinear coupling terms, higher order dissipative contributions, possibly
multivalued operators. As for the evolution of temperature, a highly nonlinear
parabolic equation has to be solved for a right hand side that is controlled
only in L^1. We prove the existence of a solution for a regularized version, by
use of a time discretization technique. Then, we perform suitable a priori
estimates which allow us pass to the limit and find a weak global-in-time
solution to the system.

single-null discharges where RMPs of toroidal mode number, n, of 4 and 6 were
applied. It has been found that, above a threshold value, the lobe structures
extend radially, linearly with the coil current, both in L-mode and H-mode. It
is observed that after the application of the RMP, as the toroidal rotation in
the confined plasma decreases, the lobes extend radially, suggesting the plasma
is less effectively screening the RMP field. Comparing the imaging data with
results from vacuum modelling shows that this technique can accurately predict
the number and poloidal location of the lobes, but over-estimates their radial
extent. More accurate estimates of the extent of the lobes can be made by
accounting for plasma screening of the RMP field. Qualitative agreement between
simulation and experiment is found if it is assumed that the RMP penetrates 2%
in normalised radius from the last closed flux surface.

the degradation or even destruction of their habitats. This can be prevented by
introducing Marine Protected Areas (MPA's), regions in the ocean or along
coastlines where fishing is controlled. MPA's can also lead to larger fish
densities outside the protected area through spill-over, which in turn may
increase the fishing yield. A natural question in this context, is where
exactly to establish an MPA, in order to maximize these benefits. This problem
is addressed along a one-dimensional stretch of coast-line, by first proposing
a model for the fish dynamics. Fish are assumed to move diffusively, and are
subject to recruitment, natural death and harvesting through fishing. The
problem is then cast as an optimal control problem for the steady state
equation corresponding to the PDE which models the fish dynamics. The
functional being maximized is a weighted sum of the average fish density and
the average fishing yield. It is shown that optimal controls exist, and that
the form of an optimal control -and hence the location of the MPA- is
determined by two key model parameters, namely the size of the coast, and the
weight of the average fish density appearing in the functional. If these
parameters are large enough -and precisely how large, can be calculated
exactly- the results indicate when and where an MPA should be established. The
results indicate that an MPA always takes the form of a Marine Reserve, where
fishing is prohibited. The main mathematical tool used to prove the results is
Pontryagin's maximum principle.

However, the current paradigm of Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) propagation
holds the effects of drifts to be negligible, and they are not accounted for in
most current SEP modelling efforts. We present full-orbit test particle
simulations of SEP propagation in a Parker spiral interplanetary magnetic field
which demonstrate that high energy particle drifts cause significant asymmetric
propagation perpendicular to the interplanetary magnetic field. Thus in many
cases the assumption of field aligned propagation of SEPs may not be valid. We
show that SEP drifts have dependencies on energy, heliographic latitude, and
charge to mass ratio, that are capable of transporting energetic particles
perpendicular to the field over significant distances within interplanetary
space, e.g. protons of initial energy 100 MeV propagate distances across the
field on the order of 1 AU, over timescales typical of a gradual SEP event. Our
results demonstrate the need for current models of SEP events to include the
effects of particle drift. We show that the drift is considerably stronger for
heavy ion SEPs due to their larger mass to charge ratio. This paradigm shift
has important consequences for the modelling of SEP events and is crucial to
the understanding and interpretation of in-situ observations.

emission around the high-redshift radio galaxy TNJ1388-1942 (z=4.11) with the
Chandra X-ray Observatory. The X-ray emission extends over a ~30-kpc diameter
region and although it is less extended than the GHz-radio lobes, it is roughly
aligned with them. We suggest that the X-ray emission arises from Inverse
Compton (IC) scattering of photons by relativistic electrons around the radio
galaxy. At z=4.11 this is the highest redshift detection of IC emission around
a radio galaxy. We investigate the hypothesis that in this compact source, the
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), which is ~700x more intense than at z~0 is
nonetheless not the relevant seed photon field for the bulk of the IC emission.
Instead, we find a tentative correlation between the IC emission and
far-infrared luminosities of compact, far-infrared luminous high-redshift radio
galaxies (those with lobe lengths of <100kpc). Based on these results we
suggest that in the earliest phases of the evolution of radio-loud AGN at very

filamentary multi-Mpc galaxy structure associated with a complex diffuse radio
emission. Our analysis is mainly based on new spectroscopic data for 128
galaxies acquired at the TNG telescope. We also use optical data available in
the SDSS and X-ray data from the Chandra archive. We select 101 cluster member
galaxies and compute the cluster redshift <z>~0.2693 and the global LOS
velocity dispersion ~1000 km/s. Our optical analysis agrees with the presence
of at least three, likely four or more, optical subclusters causing the SSE-NNW
elongation of the galaxy distribution and a significant velocity gradient in
the S-N direction. In particular, we detect an important low-velocity subclump
in the southern region, roughly coincident with the brightest peak of the
diffuse radio emission but with a clear offset between the optical and radio
peaks. We also detect one (or two) optical subcluster(s) at north, in
correspondence with the second brightest radio emission, and another one in the
central cluster region, where a third diffuse radio source has been recently
detected. A more refined analysis involving the study of the 2D galaxy
distribution suggests an even more complex structure. As for the X-ray
analysis, we confirm the SSE-NNW elongation of the intracluster medium and
detect four significant peaks. The X-ray emission is strongly asymmetric and
offsetted with respect to the galaxy distribution, thus suggesting a merger
caught in the phase of post-core-core passage. Our findings support two
possible hypotheses for the nature of the diffuse radio emission of ZwCl
2341.1+0000: a 2 relics+halo scenario or diffuse emission associated with the
infall and merging of several galaxy groups during the first phase of the
cluster formation.

considerably more difficult proof of positivity. Our proof holds for the
standard spherical infinities, but also extends to infinities of more general

Such manifolds typically have special holonomy and Sasakian structures. The
main technical advance of the paper is an expansion technique based on
""conformal Gaussian null coordinates"". This expansion helps us to understand
the consequences imposed by Einstein's equations on the asymptotic tail of the
metric field. As a by-product, we derive a coordinate expression for the
geometrically invariant formula for the Bondi mass originally given by Hollands

metals prompt consideration of the interplay between the Kondo interactions and
quantum fluctuations of the local moments alone. Toward this goal, we study a
Bose-Fermi Kondo model (BFKM) with Ising anisotropy in the presence of a local
transverse field that generates quantum fluctuations in the local-moment
sector. We apply the numerical renormalization-group method to the case of a
sub-Ohmic bosonic bath exponent and a constant conduction-electron density of
states. Starting in the Kondo phase at zero transverse-field, there is a smooth
crossover with increasing transverse field from a fully screened to a fully
polarized impurity spin. By contrast, if the system starts in its localized
phase, then increasing the transverse field causes a continuous,
Kondo-destruction transition into the partially polarized Kondo phase. The
critical exponents at this quantum phase transition exhibit hyperscaling and
take essentially the same values as those of the BFKM in zero transverse field.
The many-body spectrum at criticality varies continuously with the bare
transverse field, indicating a line of critical points. We discuss implications
of these results for the global phase diagram of the Kondo lattice model.

(or Finsler, or Lorentz) metric satisfying some generic, explicit conditions.
We couple the geodesic flow with a time-dependent potential, driven by an
external flow on some other compact manifold. If the external flow satisfies
some very general recurrence condition, and the potential satisfies some
explicit conditions that are also very general, we show that the coupled system
has orbits whose energy grows at a linear rate with respect to time. This
growth rate is optimal. We also show the existence of symbolic dynamics. The
existence of orbits whose energy grows unboundedly in time is related to
Arnold's diffusion problem. A particular case of this phenomenon is obtained
when the external dynamical system is quasi-periodic, of rationally independent
frequency vector, not necessarily Diophantine, thus extending earlier results.
We also recover `Mather's acceleration theorem' for time-periodic
perturbations. Since the general class of perturbations that we consider in
this paper are not characterized by a frequency of motion, we are not able to
use KAM or Aubry-Mather or averaging theory. We devise a new mechanism to
construct orbits whose energy evolves in a prescribed fashion. This mechanism
intertwines the inner dynamics restricted to some normally hyperbolic manifold
with the outer dynamics corresponding to two distinct choices of homoclinic
excursions to that manifold. As this mechanism uses very coarse information on
the dynamics, it is potentially of wider applicability.

shown to be stable under compact perturbations of topology and metric. Usual

assumption instead. For compatible systems coming from geometry, purity is
often easier to check than irreducibility. We use Katz's theory of rigid local
systems to construct many examples of motives to which our theorem applies. We
also show that if $F$ is a CM or totally real field and if $\pi$ is a
polarizable, regular algebraic, cuspidal automorphic representation of
$GL_n(\A_F)$, then for a positive Dirichlet density set of rational primes $l$,
the $l$-adic representations $r_{l,\imath}(\pi)$ associated to $\pi$ are

an ultra-intense laser field for the case when the radius vector joining the
center-of-masses of the \alpha-particle and the daughter is aligned with the
direction of the external field. The time-independent part of the
\alpha-daughter interaction is taken from elastic scattering compilations
whereas the time-varying part describes the interaction between the decaying
system with the laser field. The time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation is
solved numerically by appealing to a modified scheme of the Crank-Nicolson type
where an additional first-order time derivative appears compared to the
field-free case. The tunneling probability of the \alpha-cluster, and derived
quantities (decay rate, total flux) is determined for various laser intensities
and frequencies for either continous waves or few-cycle pulses of envelope
function F(t)=1. We show that in the latter case pulse sequences containing an
odd number of half-cycles determine an enhancement of the tunneling probability
compared to the field-free case and the continuous wave case. The present study
is carried out taking as example the alpha decaying nucleus $^{106}$Te.

limited frequency range propagating in a photonic crystal that is modulated on
the macroscopic level; the perturbation parameter $\lambda \ll 1$ quantifies
the separation of spatial scales. We do that by rewriting the dynamical Maxwell
equations as a Schr\""odinger-type equation and adapting space-adiabatic
perturbation theory. Just like in the case of the Bloch electron, we obtain a
simpler, effective Maxwell operator for states from within a relevant almost
invariant subspace. A correct physical interpretation for the effective
dynamics requires to establish two additional facts about the almost invariant
subspace: (1) The source-free condition has to be verified and (2) it has to
support real states. The second point also forces one to consider a multiband
problem even in the simplest possible setting; This turns out to be a major
difficulty for the extension of semiclassical methods to the domain of photonic
crystals.

virtually no collisions with impact speeds lower than the surface escape
velocity and a similar velocity-impact angle distribution for different
planetesimal masses if velocities are normalized using the escape velocity. An
additional perturbing Jupiter-like object distorts the collision velocity and

promoted if the perturber's orbit is close to the habitable zone whereas a more
distant perturber has more the effect of a mere widening of the velocity

manifest in analogous NO chemisorption systems. To verify the occurrence of
DFT-GGA overestimation of the back-donation mechanism in NO Chemisorption, we
use electronic structure analysis to show that the partially filled molecular
NO 2$\pi^{*}$ orbital rehybridizes with the transition metal $d$-band to form
new bonding and anti-bonding states. We relate the back-donation charge
transfer associated with chemisorption to the promotion of an electron from the
5$\sigma$ orbital to the 2$\pi^{*}$ orbital in the gas-phase NO
G$^{2}\Sigma^{-}\leftarrow \rm{X}^{2}\Pi$ excitation. We establish linear
relationships between $E_{\rm chem}$ and $\Delta E_{\rm G\leftarrow X}$ and go
on to formulate an $E_{\rm chem}$ correction scheme in the style of Mason {\it
et al.}, {[Physical Review B {\bf 69}, 161401(R)]}. We apply the NO $E_{\rm
chem}$ correction method to the (111) surfaces of Pt, Pd, Rh, and Ir, with NO
chemisorption modeled at a coverage of 0.25 ML. We note that both the slope of
$E_{\rm chem}$ {\it vs.} $\Delta E_{\rm G\leftarrow X}$ and the dipole moment
depend strongly on adsorption site for each metal, and we use this fact to
construct an approximate correction scheme which we go on to test using

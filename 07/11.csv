rectangular barrier is studied in terms of arrival times to a given detector

Mean arrival times are then computed and compared for different values of
initial wave packet parameters and barrier width. The agreement is improved in
the large mass limit as one expects. A short comment on the possibility of
generalization of Rosen's proposal to a two-body system is given. Differences
in distributions of particles obeying different statistics are studied by
considering a system composed of two free particles.

understanding the trigger of solar eruptive events because magnetic helicity is
believed to play a key role in solar activity due to its conservation property.
A new method for computing the photospheric distribution of the helicity flux
was recently developed. This method takes into account the magnetic field
connectivity whereas previous methods were based on photospheric signatures
only. This novel method maps the true injection of magnetic helicity in active
regions. We applied this method for the first time to an observed active
region, NOAA 11158, which was the source of intense flaring activity. We used
high-resolution vector magnetograms from the SDO/HMI instrument to compute the
photospheric flux transport velocities and to perform a nonlinear force-free
magnetic field extrapolation. We determined and compared the magnetic helicity
flux distribution using a purely photospheric as well as a connectivity-based
method. While the new connectivity-based method confirms the mixed pattern of
the helicity flux in NOAA 11158, it also reveals a different, and more correct,
distribution of the helicity injection. This distribution can be important for
explaining the likelihood of an eruption from the active region. The
connectivity-based approach is a robust method for computing the magnetic
helicity flux, which can be used to study the link between magnetic helicity
and eruptivity of observed active regions.

provide descriptors that encode useful information about hidden objects from

function. The Reeb graph provides a simple yet meaningful abstraction of the
input domain, and can also be computed efficiently.
  Given the popularity of the Reeb graph in applications, it is important to
understand its stability and robustness with respect to changes in the input
function, as well as to be able to compare the Reeb graphs resulting from
different functions.
  In this paper, we propose a metric for Reeb graphs, called the functional
distortion distance. Under this distance measure, the Reeb graph is stable
against small changes of input functions. At the same time, it remains
discriminative at differentiating input functions. In particular, the main
result is that the functional distortion distance between two Reeb graphs is
bounded from below by (and thus more discriminative than) the bottleneck
distance between both the ordinary and extended persistence diagrams for
appropriate dimensions.
  As an application of our results, we analyze a natural simplification scheme
for Reeb graphs, and show that persistent features in Reeb graph remains
persistent under simplification. Understanding the stability of important
features of the Reeb graph under simplification is an interesting problem on
its own right, and critical to the practical usage of Reeb graphs.

Dirac fields. This leads to the definition of the time-dependent scattering
operator that encodes the far-field behavior (with respect to a stationary
observer) in the asymptotic regions of the black hole: the event and
cosmological horizons. We also use the miraculous property (quoting
Chandrasekhar) - that the Dirac equation can be separated into radial and
angular ordinary differential equations - to make the link between the
time-dependent scattering operator and its stationary counterpart. This leads
to a nice expression of the scattering matrix at fixed energy in terms of
stationary solutions of the system of separated equations. In a second part, we
use this expression of the scattering matrix to study the uniqueness property
in the associated inverse scattering problem at fixed energy. Using essentially
the particular form of the angular equation (that can be solved explicitely by
Frobenius method) and the Complex Angular Momentum technique on the radial
equation, we are finally able to determine uniquely the metric of the black

that the H2 emission appears as a limb-brightened cone with additional emission
close to the jet axis. The length of the rims is about 0.3 arcsec or 42 AU

H2 emission likely traces the outer, cooler part of the disk wind while an
origin of the H2 emission in the surface layers (atmosphere) of the (flared)

little variation over six years which suggests that the outer part of the disk
wind is rather stable and probably not associated with the formation of

(negative) scattering length, mass, finite energy, and finite temperature. An
optical model with an imaginary potential at short distance reproduces
experimental recombination data and allows us to provide a simple
parametrization of the recombination rate as function of scattering length and
energy. Using the two-body van der Waals length as unit we find that the
imaginary potential range and also the potential depth agree to within thirty
percent for Lithium and Cesium atoms. As opposed to recent studies suggesting
universality of the threshold for bound state formation, our results suggest
that the recombination process itself could have universal features.

problem asks us to find a subset S that is similar to A but has smaller
conductance. A very elegant algorithm for this problem has been given by
Andersen and Lang [AL08] and requires solving a small number of
single-commodity maximum flow computations over the whole graph G. In this
paper, we introduce LocalImprove, the first cut-improvement algorithm that is
local, i.e. that runs in time dependent on the size of the input set A rather
than on the size of the entire graph. Moreover, LocalImprove achieves this
local behaviour while essentially matching the same theoretical guarantee as
the global algorithm of Andersen and Lang.
  The main application of LocalImprove is to the design of better
local-graph-partitioning algorithms. All previously known local algorithms for
graph partitioning are random-walk based and can only guarantee an output
conductance of O(\sqrt{OPT}) when the target set has conductance OPT \in [0,1].
Very recently, Zhu, Lattanzi and Mirrokni [ZLM13] improved this to O(OPT /
\sqrt{CONN}) where the internal connectivity parameter CONN \in [0,1] is
defined as the reciprocal of the mixing time of the random walk over the graph
induced by the target set. In this work, we show how to use LocalImprove to
obtain a constant approximation O(OPT) as long as CONN/OPT = Omega(1). This
yields the first flow-based algorithm. Moreover, its performance strictly
outperforms the ones based on random walks and surprisingly matches that of the
best known global algorithm, which is SDP-based, in this parameter regime
[MMV12].
  Finally, our results show that spectral methods are not the only viable
approach to the construction of local graph partitioning algorithm and open
door to the study of algorithms with even better approximation and locality
guarantees.

reporting errors. We adjust for this with a latent variable model, jointly
estimating the true (unobserved) network of contacts and duration-specific

distance, and research group membership, role, and shared projects are strongly
predictive of contact patterns. Estimated reporting probabilities were low only
for 0-5 minute contacts. Adjusting for reporting error changed the estimate of

the context of quasi-periodic pulsations, remains unclear. To address this, we
study the impulsive X-ray and UV emission during the eruptive flare of 2011
June 7 utilising X-ray imaging from RHESSI and UV 1700A imaging from SDO/AIA.
This event is associated with quasi-periodic pulsations in X-ray and possibly
UV emission, as well as substantial parallel and perpendicular motion of the
hard X-ray footpoints.
  The motion of the footpoints parallel to the flare ribbons is unusual; it is
shown to reverse direction on at least two occasions. However, there is no
associated short-timescale motion of the UV bright regions. Additionally, we
find that the locations of the brightest X-ray and UV regions are different,
particularly during the early portion of the flare impulsive phase, despite
their integrated emission being strongly correlated in time. Correlation
analysis of measured flare properties, such as the footpoint separation, flare
shear, photospheric magnetic field and coronal reconnection rate, reveals that
- in the impulsive phase - the 25 - 50 keV hard X-ray flux is only weakly
correlated with these properties, in contrast to previous studies.
  We characterise this event in terms of long-term behaviour, where the X-ray
nonthermal, thermal, and UV emission sources appear temporally and spatially
consistent, and short-term behaviour, where the emission sources are
inconsistent and quasi-periodic pulsations are a dominant feature requiring
explanation. We suggest that the short timescale behaviour of hard X-ray
footpoints, and the nature of the observed quasi-periodic pulsations, is
determined by fundamental, as-yet unobserved properties of the reconnection
region and particle acceleration sites. This presents a challenge for current
three-dimensional flare reconnection models.

It was expected for some time that this continues to hold more generally, but
Katz found a counterexample in codimension 2, showing that this relationship is
more subtle. The two main results in this paper are as follows. The first
theorem finds a simple condition under which a tropical Severi variety cannot
be a subfan of the corresponding secondary fan. The second theorem provides a
partial converse, namely, we find conditions under which a cone of the
secondary fan is fully contained in the tropical Severi variety. As a first

excites daughter p- and g-modes to large amplitudes via a quasi-static
instability. This would remove energy from the tidal bulge, resulting in
dissipation and possibly affecting the phase evolution of inspiralling binary
neutron stars and hence the extraction of binary parameters from gravitational
wave observations. This instability appears to arise because of a large
three-mode interaction among the tidal mode and high-order p- and g-modes of
similar radial wavenumber. We show that additional four-mode interactions enter
into the analysis at the same order as the three-mode terms previously
considered. We compute these four-mode couplings by finding a volume-preserving
coordinate transformation that relates the energy of a tidally deformed star to
that of a radially perturbed spherical star. Using this method, we relate the
four-mode coupling to three-mode couplings and show that there is a near-exact
cancellation between the destabilizing effect of the three-mode interactions
and the stabilizing effect of the four-mode interaction. We then show that the
equilibrium tide is stable against the quasi-static decay into daughter p- and
g-modes to leading order. The leading deviation from the quasi-static
approximation due to orbital motion of the binary is considered; while it may
slightly spoil the near-cancellation, any resulting instability timescale is at
least of order the gravitational-wave inspiral time. We conclude that the
p-/g-mode coupling does not lead to a quasi-static instability, and does not
impact the phase evolution of gravitational waves from binary neutron stars.

Way is to look at the low-metallicity stellar populations of the different
Galactic components today. For example, high-resolution spectroscopy of very
metal poor (VMP) stars demonstrates remarkable agreement between the
distribution of [Ti/Fe] in the stellar populations of the Milky Way halo (MW)
and ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies. In contrast, for the neutron capture (nc)
abundance ratio distributions [(Sr,Ba)/Fe], the peak of the small UFD sample (6
stars) exhibits a signicant under-abundance relative to the VMP stars in the
larger MW halo sample (~ 300 stars). We present a simple scenario that can
simultaneously explain these similarities and differences by assuming: (i) that
the MW VMP stars were predominately enriched by a prior generation of stars
which possessed a higher total mass than the prior generation of stars that
enriched the UFD VMP stars; and (ii) a much stronger mass-dependent yield (MDY)
for nc-elements than for the (known) MDY for Ti. Simple statistical tests
demonstrate that conditions (i) and (ii) are consistent with the observed
abundance distributions, albeit without strong constraints on model parameters.
A comparison of the broad constraints for these nc-MDY with those derived in
the literature seems to rule out Ba production from low-mass SNs and affirms
models that primarily generate yields from high-mass SN. Our scenario can be
confirmed by a relatively modest (factor of ~ 3-4) increase in the number of
high-resolution spectra of VMP stars in UFDs.

galaxies based on recent studies that indicate that galactic disks stabilise to
a constant stability parameter, which we combine with prescriptions of how the
phases of the ISM are determined and for the Star Formation Law (SFL). The
model predicts the gas surface mass density and star formation intensity of a
galaxy given its rotation curve, stellar surface mass density and the gas
velocity dispersion. This model is tested on radial profiles of neutral and
molecular ISM surface mass density and star formation intensity of 12 galaxies
selected from the THINGS sample. Our tests focus on intermediate radii.
Nevertheless, the model produces reasonable agreement with ISM mass and star
formation rate integrated over the central region in all but one case. To
optimise the model, we evaluate four recipes for the stability parameter, three
recipes for apportioning the ISM into molecular and neutral components, and
eight versions of the SFL. We find no clear-cut best prescription for the
two-fluid (gas and stars) stability parameter Q_2f and therefore for
simplicity, we use the Wang&Silk(1994) approximation (Q_WS). We found that an
empirical scaling between the molecular to neutral ISM ratio (R_mol) and the
stellar surface mass density proposed by Leroy et al. (2008) works marginally

incorporate these relations into our `Constant Q disk' (CQ-disk) model.

generate outward migration for planetary embryos less massive than $4\mearth$.
Second, system of multiple embryos generate sustained non-zero eccentricities

otherwise quiescent SMBHs in transient flares. Here we explore a more gradual
process of tidal stripping where stars approach the tidal disruption radius by
stellar evolution while in an eccentric orbit. After the onset of mass
transfer, these stars episodically transfer mass to the SMBH every pericenter
passage giving rise to low-level flares that repeat on the orbital timescale.
Giant stars, in particular, will exhibit a runaway response to mass loss and
""spoon-feed"" material to the black hole for tens to hundreds of orbital
periods. In contrast to full tidal disruption events, the duty cycle of this
feeding mode is of order unity for black holes with mass greater than
approximately 10 million solar masses. This mode of quasi-steady SMBH feeding
is competitive with indirect SMBH feeding through stellar winds, and spoon-fed
giant stars may play a significant role in determining the quiescent luminosity

(Kreckel et al. 2012). Detailed photometry, by using u, g, r, i, z SDSS images,
has shown that the overall morphology of VGS31b is very tricky, due to (i) the
presence of a highly inclined (72 deg) ring-like structure, which reaches the
galaxy center tracing a ""spiral-like"" pattern, (ii) a one sided tail towards
North-East and (iii) a bar in the central regions (Beygu et al. 2013). Such
structure is reasonably the result of a ""second event"" in the evolution history
of this galaxy, which could be a gravitational interaction with a companion
galaxy or with the environment.
  The main aim of the present work is to address the most reliable formation
scenario for this object, by comparing the observed properties, i.e. structure,
baryonic mass, kinematics and chemical abundances, with the theoretical
predictions. In particular, we have used archival spectroscopic data, to derive
the metallicity in the ring: we found a very low, sub-solar average value of Z
= 0.3 Zsun, comparable with other polar ring/disk galaxies, but lower than
those measured for ordinary spirals of similar luminosity. The study of the
chemical abundances in polar ring/disk galaxies and related objects has
received an increasing attention in recent years, since it has revealed to be a
key-parameter to disentangle among the formation scenarios suggested for this
class of objects: major merging, tidal accretion or cold accretion. In the
present work we check the cold accretion of gas through a ""cosmic filament"" as
a possible scenario for the formation of the ring-like structure in VGS31b.

occurs at finite bandwidth when its different components produce interference
packets that only partially overlap. In this case, traditional model fitting or
image reconstruction using standard formulas and tools lead to biased results.
  We propose and implement a method to overcome this effect by calculating
analytically a corrective term for the conventional interferometric
observables: the visibility amplitude and closure phase. For that purpose, we
model the interferogram taking into account the finite bandwidth and the
instrumental differential phase. We obtain generic expressions for the
visibility and closure phase in the case of temporally-modulated
interferograms, either processed using Fourier analysis or with the ABCD
method. The expressions can be used to fit arbitrary models to the data. We
then apply our results to the search and characterisation of stellar companions
with PIONIER at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer, assessing the bias on
observables and model-fitted parameters of a binary star. Finally, we consider
the role of the atmosphere, with an analytic model to identify the main
contributions to bias and also a numerical simulation of the turbulence.
  In addition to the analytic expressions, the main results of our study are:
the chromatic dispersion in the beam transport in the instrument has a strong
impact on the closure phase and introduces additional biases even at
separations where smearing is not expected to play an important role; the
atmospheric turbulence introduces additional biases when smearing is present,
but the impact is important only at very low spectral resolution; the bias on
the observables strongly depends on the recombination scheme and data
processing; the goodness of fits is improved by modelling a Gaussian bandpass
as long as the smearing is moderate.

and proportionality that are not only stronger than their standard
counter-parts but also have less information requirements. We then focus on
cake cutting with piecewise constant valuations and present three desirable
algorithms: CCEA (Controlled Cake Eating Algorithm), MEA (Market Equilibrium
Algorithm) and CSD (Constrained Serial Dictatorship). CCEA is polynomial-time,
robust envy-free, and non-wasteful. It relies on parametric network flows and
recent generalizations of the probabilistic serial algorithm. For the subdomain
of piecewise uniform valuations, we show that it is also group-strategyproof.
Then, we show that there exists an algorithm (MEA) that is polynomial-time,
envy-free, proportional, and Pareto optimal. MEA is based on computing a
market-based equilibrium via a convex program and relies on the results of

proportionality, and unanimity for piecewise constant valuations. For the case
of two agents, it is robust envy-free, robust proportional, strategyproof, and

cutting that allow for variable claims and initial endowments. We also show a
few impossibility results to complement our algorithms.

neighbor dipole-coupled two-level molecules that reveals distinct signatures of
weak and strong coupling regimes separated for infinite size arrays by a
quantum critical point. In the weak coupling regime, the ground state of the
molecular array is disordered, but in the strong coupling regime it has
(anti)ferroelectric ordering. We show that multiple molecular excitations
(odd/even in weak/strong coupling regime) can be accessed directly from the
ground state. We analyze the scaling of absorption and emission with system
size and find that the oscillator strengths show enhanced superradiant behavior
in both ordered and disordered phases. As the coupling increases, the single
excitation oscillator strength rapidly exceeds the well known Heitler-London
value. In the strong coupling regime we show the existence of a unique spectral
transition with excitation energy that can be tuned by varying the system size
and that asymptotically approaches zero for large systems. The oscillator
strength for this transition scales quadratically with system size, showing an
anomalous one-photon superradiance. For systems of infinite size, we find a
novel, singular spectroscopic signature of the quantum phase transition between
disordered and ordered ground states. We outline how arrays of ultra cold
dipolar molecules trapped in an optical lattice can be used to access the
strong coupling regime and observe the anomalous superradiant effects
associated with this regime.

Their approaches are diverse, ranging from improving HDFS and Hadoop job
scheduler to optimizing parameters in Hadoop configurations. Despite their
success in improving the performance of Hadoop jobs, however, very little is
known about the limit of their optimization performance. That is, how optimal
is a given Hadoop optimization? When a Hadoop optimization method X improves
the performance of a job by Y %, how do we know if this improvement is as good
as it can be? To answer this question, in this paper, we first examine the
ideal best case, the lower bound, of running time for Hadoop jobs and develop a
measure to accurately estimate how optimal a given Hadoop optimization is with
respect to the lower bound. Then, we demonstrate how one may exploit the
proposed measure to improve the optimization of Hadoop jobs.

  fingerprint for machine learning models of quantum chemical properties",,,,,"physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a fingerprint representation of molecules based on a Fourier
series of atomic radial distribution functions. This fingerprint is unique
(except for chirality), continuous, and differentiable with respect to atomic
coordinates and nuclear charges. It is invariant with respect to translation,
rotation, and nuclear permutation, and requires no pre-conceived knowledge
about chemical bonding, topology, or electronic orbitals. As such it meets many
important criteria for a good molecular representation, suggesting its
usefulness for machine learning models of molecular properties trained across
chemical compound space. To assess the performance of this new descriptor we
have trained machine learning models of molecular enthalpies of atomization for
training sets with up to 10k organic molecules, drawn at random from a
published set of 134k organic molecules. We validate the descriptor on all
remaining molecules of the 134k set. For a training set of 5k molecules the
fingerprint descriptor achieves a mean absolute error of 8.0 kcal/mol,
respectively. This is slightly worse than the performance attained using the
Coulomb matrix, another popular alternative, reaching 6.2 kcal/mol for the same
training and test sets.

information can improve our parameter error estimation. We consider a massive
neutrino scenario and a time-evolving dark energy equation of state in the
$\Lambda$CDM framework. We use Planck satellite experimental specifications
together with the future galaxy survey Euclid in our forecast. We found
improvements in almost all studied parameters considering Planck alone when CMB
lensing information is used. In this case, the improvement with respect to the
constraints found without using CMB lensing is of 93% around the fiducial value
for the neutrino parameter. The improvement on one of the dark energy parameter
reaches 4.4%. When Euclid information is included in the analysis, the
improvements on the neutrino parameter constraint is of approximately 128%
around its fiducial value. The addition of Euclid information provides smaller
errors on the dark energy parameters as well. For Euclid alone, the FoM is a
factor of $\sim$ 29 higher than that from Planck alone even considering CMB
lensing. Finally, the consideration of a nearly perfect CMB experiment showed
that CMB lensing cannot be neglected specially in more precise future CMB
experiments since it provided in our case a 6 times better FoM in respect to
the unlensed CMB analysis .

state will accept the political status quo, or wish to better their
circumstances through costly rebellion. In lieu of precise data we verify our
model using sensitivity analysis. We find that a small amount of
dissatisfaction is typically harmless, but can trigger sudden collapse when
there is a sufficient buildup of political inequality. Contrary to intuition, a
state is predicted to be least stable when its leadership is at the height of
its political power and thus most able to exert its influence through external

focus on the analysis of the goodness-of-fit of the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW)
profile which we find to vary with halo mass and redshift. We also find that
the fraction of halos ill-fitted by NFW varies with cosmology, thus indicating
that the mass assembly of halos with perturbed density profiles carries a
characteristic signature of Dark Energy. To access this information
independently of any parametric profile, we introduce a new observable
quantity: the halo sparsity $s_\Delta$. This is defined as the mass ratio
$M_{200}/M_\Delta$, i.e. the ratio of mass inside a sphere of radius $r_{200}$
to that contained within a radius $r_\Delta$, enclosing 200 and $\Delta$ times
the mean matter density respectively. We find the average sparsity to be nearly
independent of the total halo mass, while its value can be inferred to better
than a few percent from the ratio of the integrated halo mass functions at
overdensities $\Delta$ and 200 respectively. This provides a consistency
relation that can validate observational measurements of the halo sparsity.
Most importantly, the sparsity significantly varies with the underlying Dark
Energy model, thus providing an alternative cosmological probe.

Cartesian MRI method with unique features and capabilities. In SWIFT,
radiofrequency (RF) excitation and reception are performed nearly
simultaneously, by rapidly switching between transmit and receive during a
frequency-swept RF pulse. Because both the transmitted pulse and data
acquisition are simultaneously amplitude-modulated in SWIFT (in contrast to
continuous RF excitation and uninterrupted data acquisition in more familiar
MRI sequences), crosstalk between different frequency bands occurs in the data.
This crosstalk leads to a ""bulls-eye"" artifact in SWIFT images. We present a
method to cancel this inter-band crosstalk by cycling the pulse and receive gap
positions relative to the un-gapped pulse shape. We call this strategy ""gap
cycling.""
  Methods: We carry out theoretical analysis, simulation and experiments to
characterize the signal chain, resulting artifacts, and their elimination for
SWIFT.
  Results: Theoretical analysis reveals the mechanism for gap-cycling's
effectiveness in canceling inter-band crosstalk. We show phantom and in-vivo
results demonstrating bulls-eye artifact free images.
  Conclusion: Gap cycling is an effective method to remove bulls-eye artifact
resulting from inter-band crosstalk in SWIFT data.

the ERB volume and/or position were judged to yield inaccurate repositioning,
manual adjustment (ERB re-inflation and/or repositioning) was performed. Based
on all 59 CBCT image sets acquired, a deformable registration algorithm was
used to determine the dose received by, displacement of, and deformation of the
prostate, bladder, and anterior rectal wall. This dose tracking methodology was
applied to images taken before and after manual adjustment of the ERB
(intervention), and the delivered dose was compared to that which would have
been delivered in the absence of intervention. Interventions occurred in 24 out

was an increase in the prostate radiation dose that included 95% of the PTV

reduced prostate deformation in the anterior-posterior (AP) direction, reduced
errors in the sagittal rotation of the prostate, and increased the similarity
in shape of the prostate to the radiotherapy plan. Image-guided interventions
in ERB volume and/or position during prostate SBRT were necessary to ensure the

radioactively decaying nuclei in our simulations and study its effects on the
remnant dynamics. Although the nuclear heating substantially alters the
longterm evolution, we find that running nuclear networks over purely
hydrodynamic simulations (i.e. without heating) yields actually acceptable
nucleosynthesis results. The main dynamic effect of the radioactive heating is
to quickly smooth out inhomogeneities in the initial mass distribution,
subsequently the evolution proceeds self-similarly and after 100 years the
remnant still carries the memory of the initial binary mass ratio. We also
explore the nucleosynthetic yields for two mass ejection channels. The dynamic
ejecta very robustly produce ""strong"" r-process elements with $A > 130$ with a
pattern that is essentially independent of the details of the merging system.
From a simple model we find that neutrino-driven winds yield ""weak"" r-process
contributions with $50 < A < 130$ whose abundance patterns vary substantially
between different merger cases. This is because their electron fraction, set by
the ratio of neutrino luminosities, varies considerably from case to case. Such
winds do not produce any $^{56}{\rm Ni}$, but a range of radioactive isotopes
that are long-lived enough to produce a second, radioactively powered

frustrated lattice. The method enables to reduce the calculation amount by
using the Chebyshev polynomial expansion of the density of states compared to a
conventional Monte Carlo technique based on the exact diagonalization of the
fermion Hamiltonian matrix. Further reduction is brought by a real-space
truncation of the vector-matrix operations. We apply the method to the model
with spin-ice type Ising spins on a three-dimensional pyrochlore lattice, and
carefully examine the convergence in terms of the order of polynomials and the
truncation distance. We find that, in a wide range of electron density at a
relatively weak Kondo coupling compared to the noninteracting bandwidth, the
results by the polynomial expansion method show good convergence to those by
the conventional method within reasonable numbers of polynomials. This enables
us to study the systems up to 4x8^3 = 2048 sites, while the previous study by
the conventional method was limited to 4x4^3 = 256 sites. On the other hand,
the real-space truncation is not helpful in reducing the calculation amount for
the system sizes that we reached, as the sufficient convergence is obtained
when most of the sites are involved within the truncation distance. The
necessary truncation distance, however, appears not to show significant system
size dependence, suggesting that the truncation method becomes efficient for
larger system sizes.

These winds produce `weak' r-process material with $50 < A < 130$ and abundance

opacity of 1 cm$^2$/g, the resulting transients peak in the UV/optical about 6
h after the merger with a luminosity of $\approx 10^{41}$ erg/s (for a wind of

searches (e.g. using Hypersuprime camera on Subaru). A subsequent detection of
the weaker but longer lasting IR signal would allow an identification of the
merger event. We briefly discuss the implications of our results to the recent

opportunities for ground-based astronomy but can provide information on

demonstrate quantitatively how this works. Aureole profiles can be followed out
to ~0.2 degrees from stars and ~0.5 degrees from Jupiter. Interpretation of
diffracted starlight is similar to that for sunlight, but emphasizes larger
particles. Stellar diffraction profiles are very distinctive, typically being
approximately flat out to a critical angle followed by gradually steepening
power-law falloff with slope less steep than -3. Using the relationship between
the phase function for diffraction and the average Fourier transform of the
projected area of complex ice crystals we show that defining particle size in
terms of average projected area normal to the propagation direction of the
starlight leads to a simple, analytic approximation representing large-particle
diffraction that is nearly independent of crystal habit. A similar analytic
approximation for the diffraction aureole allows it to be separated from the
point spread function and the sky background. Multiple scattering is
deconvolved using the Hankel transform leading to the diffraction phase
function. Application of constrained numerical inversion to the phase function
then yields a solution for the particle size distribution in the range between
~50 microns and ~400 microns. Stellar aureole measurements can provide one of
the very few, as well as least expensive, methods for retrieving cirrus
microphysical properties from ground-based observations.

  progenitors","24 pages, 18 figures. Submitted to A&A",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context. The uncertainty in the degree to which radiation-driven winds of hot
stars might be affected by small inhomogeneities in the density leads to a
corresponding uncertainty in the determination of the atmospheric mass loss
rates from the strength of optical recombination lines. Furthermore, the
optical recombination lines also react sensitively to even small changes in the
density structure resulting from the (often assumed instead of computed)
velocity law of the outflow. This raises the question of how reliable the
parameter determinations from such lines are.
  Results. The discrepancy between the optical and the UV analyses is confirmed
to be the result of a missing consistency between stellar and wind parameters
in the optical analysis. The influence of the density (velocity field) is of
the same order as that of moderate clumping factors. Moderate clumping factors
leave the UV spectra mostly unaffected, indicating that the influence on the
ionization balance, and thus on the radiative acceleration, is small. Instead
of the erratic behavior of the clumping factors claimed from the optical
analyses, our analysis based on the velocity field computed from radiative
driving yields similar clumping factors for all CSPNs. The shock temperatures
and the ratios of X-ray to bolometric luminosity required to reproduce the
highly ionized Ovi line agree with those known from massive O stars, again
confirming the similarity of O-type CSPN and massive O star atmospheres.
  Conclusions. The similarity of the winds of O-type CSPNs and those of massive
O stars justifies using the same methods based on the dynamics of
radiation-driven winds in their analysis, thus supporting the earlier result
that several of the CSPNs in the sample have near-Chandrasekhar-limit masses
and may thus be possible single-star progenitors of type Ia supernovae.

that of K transitions of neutral or low-ionized metal elements are still very
uncertain. Spectroscopy of absorption lines produced in the interstellar medium

of these atomic transitions. In this work we analyze 36 Chandra High Energy
Transmission Grating observations and search for and measure the ISM absorption
lines along sight lines of 11 low-mass X-ray binaries. We correct the Galactic
rotation velocity to the rest frame for every observation and then use two
different methods to merge all the corrected spectra to a co-added spectrum.
However the co-added spectra obtained by these methods exhibit biases, either
to the observations of high counts or high signal-to-noise ratios of the lines.
We make Bayesian analysis to several significantly detected lines to obtain the
systematic uncertainty and the bias correction of other lines. Compared to

been a challenge for the neutron star with a hyperon core (namely hyperon
star), since hyperons usually reduce the theoretical maximum mass of the star.
In this article, we consider dark matter as another possible constituent in
hyperon stars' interior to loose this mass constrain. We take dark matter as
self-interacting Fermi gas with certain repulsive interaction among the dark
matter particles and non-interaction between dark matter and ordinary matter as
is generally assumed. We find that the star maximum mass is sensitive to the
particle mass of dark matter, and a high enough star mass larger than 2
$M_{\odot}$ could be achieved when the particle mass is small enough. In this
particular model, a strong upper limit 0.64 GeV for dark matter mass is
obtained in strongly-interacting dark matter and 0.16 GeV for dark matter mass
in weakly-interacting dark matter. Dark matter accumulated around the star
could also contribute to the mass measurement, however, such contribution could
be safely ignored when the generally used dark matter density is assumed.

if the peculiar results found in \omega Cen are unique to this cluster. M22
also hosts multiple sub-populations of stars with a spread in metallicity,

characterized when either the intended stream or interfering streams experience
Rician fading, and when the fading may be correlated on the transmit side.
Previously, exact ZF analysis based on a well-known SNR expression has been
hindered by the noncentrality of the Wishart distribution involved. In
addition, approximation with a central-Wishart distribution has not proved
consistently accurate. In contrast, the following exact ZF study proceeds from
a lesser-known SNR expression that separates the intended and interfering
channel-gain vectors. By first conditioning on, and then averaging over the
interference, the ZF SNR distribution for Rician-Rayleigh fading is shown to be
an infinite linear combination of gamma distributions. On the other hand, for
Rayleigh-Rician fading, the ZF SNR is shown to be gamma-distributed. Based on
the SNR distribution, we derive new series expressions for the ZF average error
probability, outage probability, and ergodic capacity. Numerical results
confirm the accuracy of our new expressions, and reveal effects of interference

information. Ideally this occurs without net charge currents in order to avoid
energy dissipation due to Joule heating. To this end the ability to create pure
spin currents i.e.without net charge transfer is essential. Spin pumping is the
most popular approach to generate pure spin currents in metals, semiconductors,
graphene, and even organic materials. When the magnetization vector in a
ferromagnet (FM) - normal metal (NM) junction is excited the spin pumping
effect leads to the injection of pure spin currents in the normal metal. The
polarization of this spin current is time dependent and contains a very small
dc component. The dc-component of the injected spin current has been intensely
studied in recent years and has given rise to controversial discussions
concerning the magnitude the spin Hall angle which is a material dependent
measure of the efficiency of spin to charge conversion . However in contrast to
the rather well understood dc component the two orders of magnitude larger ac
component has escaped experimental detection so far. Here we show that the
large ac component of the spin currents can be detected very efficiently using
the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE). The observed ac-ISHE voltages are one
order of magnitude larger than the conventional dc-ISHE measured on the same
device. The spectral shape, angular dependence, power scaling behavior and
absolute magnitude of the signals are in line with spin pumping and ISHE
effects. Our results demonstrate that FM-NM junctions are very efficient
sources of pure spin currents in the GHz frequency range and we believe that
our result will stimulate the emerging field of ac spintronics.

  The HI disc of NGC 55 appears to be distorted on all scales. There is a
strong east-west asymmetry in the column density distribution along the major

We also find evidence of streaming motions of the gas along the bar of NGC 55.
The fitting of tilted rings to the velocity field reveals a strong warping of
the outer gas disc which could be the result of tidal interaction with either
NGC 300 or a smaller satellite galaxy. Finally, we find a large number of
distinct clumps and spurs across the entire disc, indicating that internal or
external processes, such as satellite accretion or gas outflows, have stirred
up the gas disc.
  We also detect several isolated HI clouds within about 20 kpc projected
distance from NGC 55. Their dynamical properties and apparent concentration
around NGC 55 suggest that most of the clouds are forming a circum-galactic
population similar to the high-velocity clouds of the Milky Way and M31,

Markov field environments for pixelwise image segmentation, considering the
labels of the image as hidden states and solving the estimation of such labels
as a solution of the MAP equation. The emission distribution is assumed the
same in all models, and the difference lays in the Markovian prior hypothesis
made over the labeling random field. The a priori labeling knowledge will be
modeled with a) a second order anisotropic Markov Mesh and b) a classical
isotropic Potts model. Under such models, we will consider three different
segmentation procedures, 2D Path Constrained Viterbi training for the Hidden
Markov Mesh, a Graph Cut based segmentation for the first order isotropic Potts
model, and ICM (Iterated Conditional Modes) for the second order isotropic
Potts model.
  We provide a unified view of all three methods, and investigate goodness of
fit for classification, studying the influence of parameter estimation,
computational gain, and extent of automation in the statistical measures
Overall Accuracy, Relative Improvement and Kappa coefficient, allowing robust
and accurate statistical analysis on synthetic and real-life experimental data
coming from the field of Dental Diagnostic Radiography. All algorithms, using
the learned parameters, generate good segmentations with little interaction
when the images have a clear multimodal histogram. Suboptimal learning proves
to be frail in the case of non-distinctive modes, which limits the complexity
of usable models, and hence the achievable error rate as well.

has two A-type stars in a proven binary system at the centre. However, the
radiation from these two central stars is too soft to ionize the surrounding
material leading to a so far fruitless search for the responsible ionizing
source. Such a source is clearly required and has already been inferred to
exist via an observed temporal variation of the centre-of-mass velocity of the
A-type stars. Moreover, the ejected nebula is nitrogen-rich which raises
question about the mass-loss process from a likely intermediate-mass
progenitor. We use optical integral-field spectroscopy to study the emission
lines of the inner nebula ring. This has enabled us to perform an empirical
analysis of the optical collisionally excited lines, together with a fully
three-dimensional photoionization modelling. Our empirical results are used to
constrain the photoionization models, which determine the evolutionary stage of
the responsible ionizing source and its likely progenitor. The time-scale for
the evolutionary track of a hydrogen-rich model atmosphere is inconsistent with
the dynamical age obtained for the ring. This suggests that the central star
has undergone a very late thermal pulse. We conclude that the ionizing star
could be hydrogen-deficient and compatible with what is known as a PG 1159-type
star. The evolutionary tracks for the very late thermal pulse models imply a
central star mass of ~ 0.64M${}_{\odot}$, which originated from a ~
3M${}_{\odot}$ progenitor. The evolutionary time-scales suggest that the
central star left the asymptotic giant branch about 25,000 years ago, which is
consistent with the nebula's age.

Specifically, it may suffer from cheating problems and fault authentication

In this paper, we explore the property of verifiable secret sharing(VSS)

distributed storage scheme based on CRT-VSS and trusted computing for MANET.
Specifically, we utilize trusted computing technology to solve two existing

sessions form separate overlay networks and operate independently, where some
sessions may suffer from insufficient resources even though other sessions have
excessive resources. To cope with this problem, we consider the universal
swarming approach, which allows multiple sessions to cooperate with each other.
We formulate the problem of finding the optimal resource allocation to maximize
the sum of the session utilities and present a subgradient algorithm which
converges to the optimal solution in the time-average sense. The solution
involves an NP-hard subproblem of finding a minimum-cost Steiner tree. We cope
with this difficulty by using a column generation method, which reduces the
number of Steiner-tree computations. Furthermore, we allow the use of
approximate solutions to the Steiner-tree subproblem. We show that the
approximation ratio to the overall problem turns out to be no less than the
reciprocal of the approximation ratio to the Steiner-tree subproblem.
Simulation results demonstrate that universal swarming improves the performance
of resource-poor sessions with negligible impact to resource-rich sessions. The
proposed approach and algorithm are expected to be useful for
infrastructure-based content distribution networks with long-lasting sessions

$p\leq k$ distinct sampled species has received attention for long. It requires
a model of species abundance together with a sampling model. We start with a
discrete model of iid stochastic species abundances, each with Gibbs-Poisson
distribution. A $k-$sample drawn from the $n-$species abundances vector is the
one obtained while conditioning it on summing to $k$% . We discuss the sampling
formulae (species occupancy distributions, frequency of frequencies) in this
context. We then develop some aspects of the estimation of $n$ problem from the
size $k$ of the sample and the observed value of $P_{n,k}$, the number of
distinct sampled species. It is shown that it always makes sense to study these
occupancy problems from a Gibbs-Poisson abundance model in the context of a
population with infinitely many species. From this extension, a parameter
$\gamma $ naturally appears, which is a measure of richness or diversity of
species. We rederive the sampling formulae for a population with infinitely
many species, together with the distribution of the number $P_{k}$ of distinct
sampled species. We investigate the estimation of $\gamma $ problem from the
sample size $k$ and the observed value of $P_{k}$. We then exhibit a large
special class of Gibbs-Poisson distributions having the property that sampling
from a discrete abundance model may equivalently be viewed as a sampling
problem from a random partition of unity, now in the continuum. When $n$ is
finite, this partition may be built upon normalizing $% n$ infinitely divisible
iid positive random variables by its partial sum. It is shown that the sampling
process in the continuum should generically be biased on the total length
appearing in the latter normalization. A construction with size-biased sampling
from the ranked normalized jumps of a subordinator is also supplied, would the
problem under study present infinitely many species. We illustrate our point of
view with many examples, some of which being new ones.

computational time and high convergence speed. Simulation results show that the
proposed routing algorithms find the optimal shortest path taking into account
three most important parameters of network dynamics. It has been further
observed that for the shortest path problem BB-BC outperforms BBO in terms of

The exact reasoning based shortest path evaluation methods usually fail to meet
this rigid requirement. Thus, requiring some soft computing based approaches

people in social activities is highly desirable from various perspectives

that notifies barrier information nearby users outside to lowers the anxiety of
elderly people and promote their social activities. There are barrier free maps
in some areas, but those are static and updated annually at the earliest.
However, there exist temporary barriers like road repairing and parked
bicycles, and also every barrier is not for every elder person. That is, the
elder people are under several conditions and wills to go out, so that a
barrier for an elder person is not necessarily the one for the other.
Therefore, we first collect the barrier information in the user participatory
manner and select the ones the user need to know, then timely provide them via
a mobile phone equipped with GPS. This paper shows the public experiment that
we conducted in Tokyo, and confirms the usability and the accuracy of the
information filtering.

reducing the area of digital systems. However, the evolution of portable
systems and advanced Deep Sub-Micron fabrication technologies have brought
power dissipation as another critical design factor. Low power design reduces
cooling cost and increases reliability especially for high density systems.
Moreover, it reduces the weight and size of portable devices. The power
dissipation in CMOS circuits consists of static and dynamic components. Since
dynamic power is proportional to V2 dd and static power is proportional to Vdd,
lowering the supply voltage and device dimensions, the transistor threshold
voltage also has to be scaled down to achieve the required performance. In case
of static power, the power is consumed during the steady state condition i.e
when there are no input/output transitions. Static power has two sources: DC
power and Leakage power. Consecutively to facilitate voltage scaling without
disturbing the performance, threshold voltage has to be minimized. Furthermore
it leads to better noise margins and helps to avoid the hot carrier effects in
short channel devices. In this paper we have been proposed the new CMOS library
for the complex digital design using scaling the supply voltage and device
dimensions and also suggest the methods to control the leakage current to
obtain the minimum power dissipation at optimum value of supply voltage and
transistor threshold. In this paper CMOS Cell library has been implemented
using TSMC (0.18um) and TSMC (90nm) technology using HEP2 tool of IC designing

Boltzmann statistics, and is identical to ring-polymer molecular dynamics

no recrossing (by the real-time quantum dynamics) of the ring-polymer dividing

fluctuations in the polymer-bead positions along the reaction coordinate. In
practice, this means that RPMD-TST gives a good approximation to the exact
quantum rate for direct reactions, provided the temperature is not too far
below the cross-over to deep tunnelling. We derive these results by comparing
the long-time limit of the ring-polymer flux-side time-correlation function
with that of a hybrid flux-side time-correlation function (containing a
ring-polymer flux operator and a Miller-Schwarz-Tromp side function), and by
representing the resulting ring-polymer momentum integrals as hypercubes.

that enables perturbative expansions.

show that NaO2 exhibits a rich variety of magnetic properties, which are
controlled by relative alignment of the superoxide molecules as well as the
state of partially filled antibonding molecular \pi_g-orbitals. The orbital
degeneracy and disorder in the high-temperature pyrite phase gives rise to weak
isotropic antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions between the molecules. The
transition to the low-temperature marcasite phase lifts the degeneracy, leading
to the orbital order and formation of the quasi-one-dimensional AFM spin
chains. Both tendencies are consistent with the behavior of experimental
magnetic susceptibility data. Furthermore, we evaluate the magnetic transition
temperature and type of the long-range magnetic order in the marcasite phase.
We argue that this magnetic order depends on the behavior of weak isotropic as
well as anisotropic and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange interactions between the
molecules. Finally, we predict the existence of a multiferroic phase, where the
inversion symmetry is broken by the long-range magnetic order, giving rise to
substantial ferroelectric polarization.

and subsonic (settling) accretion which occurs when plasma remains hot until it
meets the magnetospheric boundary. Two regimes of accretion are separated by an
X-ray luminosity of about $4\times10^{36}$ erg/s. In the subsonic case, which
sets in at low luminosities, a hot quasi-spherical shell must be formed around
the magnetosphere, and the actual accretion rate onto NS is determined by
ability of the plasma to enter the magnetosphere due to Rayleigh-Taylor
instability. We calculate the rate of plasma entry the magnetopshere and the
angular momentum transfer in the shell due to turbulent viscosity appearing in
the convective differentially rotating shell. We also discuss and calculate the
structure of the magnetospheric boundary layer where the angular momentum
between the rotating magnetosphere and the base of the differentially rotating

super-Earths. From measured radii and masses, we can infer planetary internal
compositions. It has been recently revealed that super-Earths are diverse in
composition. Such a diversity is thought to arise from diversity in volatile
content. The stability of the volatile components is to be examined, because
hot super-Earths undergo photo-evaporative mass loss. While several studies
investigated the impact of photo-evaporative mass loss on hydrogen-helium
envelopes, there are few studies as to the impact on water-vapor envelopes. To
obtain theoretical prediction to future observations, we also investigate the
relationships among masses, radii, and semimajor axes of water-rich
sub/super-Earths that have undergone photo-evaporative mass loss. We simulate
the interior structure and evolution of sub/super-Earths that consist of a
rocky core surrounded by a water envelope, including mass loss due to the
stellar XUV-driven energy-limited hydrodynamic escape. We find that the
photo-evaporative mass loss has a significant impact on the evolution of hot
sub/super-Earths. We then derive the threshold planetary mass and radius below
which the planet loses its water envelope completely as a function of the
initial water content, and find that there are minimums of the threshold mass
and radius. We constrain the domain in the parameter space of planetary mass,
radius, and semimajor axis in which sub/super-Earths never retain water
envelopes in 1-10 Gyr. This would provide an essential piece of information for
understanding the origin of close-in low-mass planets. The current
uncertainties in stellar XUV flux and its heating efficiency, however, prevent
us from deriving robust conclusions. Nevertheless, it seems to be a robust
conclusion that Kepler planet candidates contain a significant number of rocky
sub/super-Earths.

conduction events for ions that are virtually indistinguishable from those of
protein channel. By indistinguishable we mean that one cannot decide based on
the current trace alone whether conductance events originate from a membrane,
which does or does not contain channel proteins. Additional evidence is
required to distinguish between the two cases, and it is not always certain
that such evidence can be provided. The phenomenological similarities are
striking and span a wide range of phenomena: The typical conductances are of
equal order and both lifetime distributions and current histograms are similar.
One finds conduction bursts, flickering, and multistep-conductance. Lipid
channels can be gated by voltage, and can be blocked by drugs. They respond to
changes in lateral membrane tension and temperature. Thus, they behave like
voltage-gated, temperature-gated and mechano-sensitive protein channels, or
like receptors. Lipid channels are remarkably under-appreciated. However, the
similarity between lipid and protein channels poses an eminent problem for the
interpretation of protein channel data. For instance, the Hodgkin-Huxley theory
for nerve pulse conduction requires a selective mechanism for the conduction of
sodium and potassium ions. To this end, the lipid membrane must act both as a
capacitor and as an insulator. Non-selective ion conductance by mechanisms
other than the gated protein-channels challenges the proposed mechanism for
pulse propagation. ... Some important questions arise: Are lipid and protein
channels similar due a common mechanism, or are these similarities fortuitous?
Is it possible that both phenomena are different aspects of the same
phenomenon? Are lipid and protein channels different at all? ... (abbreviated)

suggest that the fraction of targets hosting radio halos may have to be revised
upwards for clusters selected using the SZ effect: while approximately 60 per
cent of the X-ray selected targets are found to contain no extended radio
emission, in agreement with previous findings, the corresponding fraction in

installations, denominated ""Atmoscopes"", have been cross-calibrated before
deployment, and their sensitivity is monitored every two to five months. We
show that a thoroughly developed model of the integral contribution of
starlight to the overall light measure serves as an additional
cross-calibration for each device during each night, reducing the systematic
uncertainty of this measurement to less than 15%. The starlight can then be
subtracted from the measurements, and the residuals compared among the
different sites. We show that in most cases a decomposition into the
contributions from zodiacal light, airglow and anthropogenic light pollution is
possible.

Spectroscopic analyses to interpret the spectra of the brightest
supernovae from the UV to the near-IR provide a powerful tool with great
astrophysical potential for the determination of the physical state of the
ejecta, their chemical composition, and the SNe distances even at significant
redshifts.
  Methods. We report on improvements of computing synthetic spectra for SNIa
with respect to i) an improved and sophisticated treatment of thousands of
strong lines that interact intricately with the ""pseudo-continuum"" formed
entirely by Doppler- shifted spectral lines, ii) an improved and expanded
atomic database, and iii) the inclusion of energy deposition within the ejecta.
  Results. We show that an accelerated lambda iteration procedure we have
developed for the mutual interaction of strong spectral lines appearing in the
atmospheres of SNeIa solves the longstanding problem of transferring the
radiative energy from the UV into the optical regime. In detail we discuss
applications of the diagnostic technique by example of a standard SNIa, where
the comparison of calculated and observed spectra revealed that in the early
phases the consideration of the energy deposition within the spectrum-forming
regions of the ejecta does not qualitatively alter the shape of the spectra.
  Conclusions. The results of our investigation lead to an improved
understanding of how the shape of the spectrum changes radically as function of
depth in the ejecta, and show how different emergent spectra are formed as a
result of the particular physical properties of SNe Ia ejecta and the resulting
peculiarities in the radiative transfer. This provides an important insight
into the process of extracting information from observed SNIa spectra, since
these spectra are a complex product of numerous unobservable SNIa spectral
features which are thus analyzed in parallel to the observable spectral
features.

a short circuit and fire. On the example of the most common polymer
insulator-PVC subjected to preliminary partial thermolysis, simulating the
process of accelerated aging, we for the first time show that in this case as a
result of the aging process, the electrical conductivity of PVC can acquire
abnormal (not obeying Ohm's law) character. In this case, transitions from a
state with normal (low) conductivity of PVC into the state with an ab-normally
high conductivity was clearly observed, being spontaneous uncontrollable

transferring polyvinylchloride from a state of typical dielectric (insulator)
in a class of conductors attracts attention.). Thus, an-other one of the most
important features of a short circuit in the PVC insulation is opened. It is
noted that the reduction of fire hazards in this case (by the maximum possible

that the thermal conductivity in nanowires with free polar (0001) surfaces is
much higher than in nanowires that have been stabilized with reduced charges on
the polar (0001) surfaces, and also hexagonal nanowires without any transverse
polar surfaces. From normal mode analysis, we show that the higher thermal
conductivity is due to a shell-like reconstruction that occurs for the free
polar surfaces. This shell-like reconstruction suppresses twisting motion in
the nanowires such that the bending phonon modes are not scattered by the other
phonon modes, and leads to substantially higher thermal conductivity in the ZnO
nanowire with free polar surfaces. Furthermore, the auto-correlation function
of the normal mode coordinate is utilized to extract the phonon lifetime, which
leads to a concise explanation for the higher thermal conductivity in ZnO

without polar surfaces, which exhibit low thermal conductivity, are more
promising candidates for thermoelectric applications than nanowires with polar

involving Steiner Arborescence. One is the continuous problem of the Symmetric
Rectilinear Steiner Arborescence (SRSA), studied by Berman and Coulston.
  A very related, but discrete problem (studied separately in the past) is the
online Multimedia Content Delivery (MCD) problem on line networks, presented
originally by Papadimitriu, Ramanathan, and Rangan. An efficient content
delivery was modeled as a low cost Steiner arborescence in a grid of
network*time they defined. We study here the version studied by Charikar,
Halperin, and Motwani (who used the same problem definitions, but removed some
constraints on the inputs).
  The bounds on the competitive ratios introduced separately in the above
papers are similar for the two problems: O(log N) for the continuous problem
and O(log n) for the network problem, where N was the number of terminals to
serve, and n was the size of the network. The lower bounds were Omega(sqrt{log
N}) and Omega(sqrt{log n}) correspondingly. Berman and Coulston conjectured
that both the upper bound and the lower bound could be improved.
  We disprove this conjecture and close these quadratic gaps for both problems.
We first present an O(sqrt{log n}) deterministic competitive algorithm for MCD
on the line, matching the lower bound. We then translate this algorithm to
become a competitive optimal algorithm O(sqrt{log N}) for SRSA. Finally, we
translate the latter back to solve MCD problem, this time competitive optimally
even in the case that the number of requests is small (that is, O(min{sqrt{log
n},sqrt{log N}})). We also present a Omega(sqrt[3]{log n}) lower bound on the

the Wilson Loop. This allows us to establish an equivalence between the path
ordered integral of the non-Abelian gauge fields with an integral over an
Abelian restricted gauge field which is tractable both theoretically and
numerically in lattice QCD. By using Stokes' theorem, we can relate the Wilson
Loop in terms of a surface integral over a restricted field strength, and show
that the restricted field strength may be dominated by topological structures,
which occur when one of the parameters parametrising the colour field $n$ winds
itself around a non-analyticity in the colour field. If they exist, these
objects will lead to an area law scaling for the Wilson Loop and provide a
mechanism for quark confinement. We search for these structures in quenched
lattice QCD. We perform the Abelian decomposition, and find that the restricted
field strength is dominated by peaks on the lattice. Wilson Loops containing
these peaks show a stronger area-Law and thus provide the dominant contribution
to the string tension.

(e.g. CML, Chemical Markup Language), MathML formulae and computational
specifications (DeXML) to create executable documents which include scientific
data and mathematical formulae. These documents preserve the provenance of the
data used, and build tight semantic links between components of mathematical
formulae and domain objects---in effect grounding the mathematical semantics in
the scientific domain. The Declaratron takes these specifications and i)
carries out entity resolution and decoration to prepare for computation ii)
uses a MathML execution engine to run calculations over the revised tree iii)
outputs domain objects and the complete document to give both results and an
encapsulated history of the computation. A short description of a case study is
given to illustrate how the system can be used. Many scientific problems
require frequent change of the mathematical functional form and the Declaratron
provides this without requiring changes to code. Additionally, it supports
reproducible science, machine indexing and semantic search of computations,
makes implicit assumptions visible, and separates domain knowledge from
computational techniques. We believe that the Declaratron could replace much
conventional procedural code in science.

of RTQFT is shown to be a phase-space mapping of the quantum system based on
the symmetric (Weyl) ordering. Following this observation, we define
generalised Keldysh rotations based on the class of operator orderings
introduced by Cahill and Glauber [Phys.\ Rev.\ {177} (1969) 1882]. Each
rotation is a phase-space mapping, generalising the corresponding ordering from
free to interacting fields. In particular, response transformation [L.P.\ and
S.S., Ann.\ Phys. (N.Y.) {323} (2008) 1989] extends the normal ordering of
free-field operators to the time-normal ordering of Heisenberg\ operators.
Structural properties of the response transformation, such as its association
with the nonlinear quantum response problem and the related causality
properties, hold for all generalised Keldysh rotations.
  Furthermore, we argue that response transformation is especially suited for
RTQFT formulation of spatial, in particular, relativistic, problems, because it
extends cancellation of zero-point fluctuations, characteristic of the normal
ordering, to interacting fields. As an example, we consider quantised
electromagnetic\ field in the Dirac sea. In the time-normally-ordered
representation, dynamics of the field looks essentially classical (fields
radiated by currents), without any contribution from zero-point fluctuations.
For comparison, we calculate zero-point fluctuations of the interacting
electromagnetic\ field under orderings other than time-normal. The resulting
expression is physically inconsistent: it does not obey the Lorentz condition,
nor Maxwell's equations.

DTX in a BS. Overall potential gains are evaluated by comparison of a
conventional SOTA BS with one that employs DTX exclusively, a power control
scheme and an optimal combined DTX and power control scheme. Fundamental limits
of the achievable savings are found to be at 5.5 dB under low load and 2 dB
under high load when comparing the SOTA consumption with optimal allocation
under the chosen power model.

power and duration. This paper extends our previous work on power optimal
resource allocation in the mobile downlink by detailing the optimal power
control strategy investigation and extracting fundamental characteristics of
power optimal operation in cellular downlink. We find that only a system wide
allocation of transmit powers is optimal rather than on link level. The
allocation strategy that minimizes overall power consumption requires the
transmission power on all links to be increased if only one link degrades.
Furthermore, we show that for mobile stations with equal channels but different
rate requirements, it is power optimal to assign equal transmit powers with
proportional transmit durations. To relate the effectiveness of power control
to live operation, we take the power model into consideration which maps
transmit power to supply power. We show that due to the affine mapping, the
solution is independent of the power model. However, the effectiveness of power
control measures is completely dependent on the underlying hardware and the
load dependence factor of a base station (instead of absolute consumption
values). Finally, we conclude that power control measures in base stations are
most relevant in macro stations which have load dependence factor of more than
50%.

to other settings. The Standard Model (SM) degrees of freedom reside in a local
system of 7-branes wrapping a 4-fold S in the extra dimensions. It is known
that in the presence of closed string 3-form fluxes SUSY-breaking terms are
typically generated. We explore the generation dependence of these soft terms
and find that non-universalities arise whenever the flux varies over the 4-fold
S. These non-universalities are parametrically suppressed by
(M_{GUT}/M_{Pl})^{1/3}. They also arise in the case of varying open string
fluxes, in this case parametrically suppressed by \alpha_{GUT}^{1/2}. For a
standard unification scheme with M_{GUT} = 10^{16} GeV and \alpha_{\rm GUT} =
1/24 these suppressions are very mild. Although limits from the kaon mass
difference \Delta m_K are easily obeyed for squark masses above the present LHC
limits, constraints from the CP-violation parameter \epsilon_K imply squark
masses in the multi-TeV region. The constraints from BR(\mu \rightarrow
e\gamma) turn out to be the strongest ones, with slepton masses of order ~10
TeV or heavier required to obey the experimental limits. These sfermion masses
are consistent with the observed large value m_H ~ 126 GeV of the Higgs mass.

tool as their exceptional brightness makes them observable even at very large
distances (up to redshifts around z~1). To investigate possible systematic
differences between local and distant SN Ia requires detailed models whose
synthetic spectra can be compared to observations, and in which the solution of
the radiative transfer is a key ingredient. One commonly employed method is the
Feautrier scheme, which is generally very robust, but which can yield wrong
results under certain conditions that frequently occur in the modelling of
supernova ejecta or even in the radiatively driven expanding atmospheres of hot
stars.
  Methods. We use a sophisticated model atmosphere code which takes into
account the non-LTE effects and high velocity gradients that strongly affect
the physics of SN Ia atmospheres at all wavelengths to simulate the formation
of SN Ia spectra by the thousands of strong spectral lines which intricately
interact with the ""pseudo-continuum"" formed entirely by these Doppler-shifted
lines themselves. We focus to an investigation of the behavior of the Feautrier
scheme under these conditions.
  Results. Synthetic spectra of SN Ia, a complex product of computer models
replicating numerous physical processes that determine the conditions of matter
and radiation in the ejecta, are affected by large spatial jumps of the
line-dominated opacities and source functions for which the application of even
well-established methods may harbor certain pitfalls. We analyze the conditions
that can lead to a breakdown of conventional procedures and we derive for the
Feautrier radiative transfer solver a modified description which yields more
accurate results in the given circumstances.

excited vibrational state can propagate along the chain. However the
propagation is neither ballistic nor diffusion like. The time T_m for the first

over the chain fragments (sites in the model) remains random, and the

et al. In it, each of N agents corresponds to a vertex, which can create edges
to other vertices at a cost of alpha each, for some parameter alpha. Every edge
can be freely used by every vertex, regardless of who paid the creation cost.
To reflect the desire to be close to other vertices, each agent's cost function
is further augmented by the sum total of all (graph theoretic) distances to all
other vertices.
  Previous research proved that for many regimes of the (alpha, N) parameter
space, the total social cost (sum of all agents' costs) of every Nash
equilibrium is bounded by at most a constant multiple of the optimal social
cost. In algorithmic game theoretic nomenclature, this approximation ratio is
called the price of anarchy. In our paper, we significantly sharpen some of
those results, proving that for all constant non-integral alpha > 2, the price
of anarchy is in fact 1+o(1), i.e., not only is it bounded by a constant, but
it tends to 1 as N tends to infinity. For constant integral alpha >= 2, we show
that the price of anarchy is bounded away from 1. We provide quantitative

not only provide computational advantages when considering the left and right
tail large deviations for general potentials, as is done explicitly for the
first multi-critical potential, but it also offers an interesting
interpretation of the results. In particular, it is seen that the left tail
large deviations follow from a standard perturbative large N expansion of the
free energy, while the right tail large deviations are related to the
non-perturbative expansion and thus to instanton corrections. Considering the
standard interpretation of instantons as tunnelling of eigenvalues, we see that
the right tail rate function can be identified with the instanton action which
in turn can be given as a simple expression in terms of the spectral curve.
From the string theory point of view these non-perturbative corrections
correspond to branes and can be identified with FZZT branes.

identifiable, for example, due to large pulse fraction, would be the proof of
the dynamo field origin. Existence of such sources is in correspondence with

CEN34, thought to be associated with the star forming region M17. Its optical
to near-infrared (550-2500 nm) spectrum reveals several photospheric absorption
features, such as H{\alpha}, Ca triplet and CO bandheads but lacks any emission
lines. The spectral features in the range 8375-8770{\AA} are used to constrain
an effective temperature of 5250\pm250 (early-/mid-G) and a surface gravity of
2.0\pm0.3 (supergiant). The spectral energy distribution of CEN34 resembles the
SED of a high-mass YSO or an evolved star. Moreover, the observed temperature
and surface gravity are identical for high-mass YSOs and evolved stars. The
radial velocity relative to LSR (V_LSR) of CEN34 as obtained from various
photospheric lines is of the order of -60 km/s and thus distinct from the +25
km/s found for several OB stars in the cluster and for the associated molecular
cloud. The SED modeling yields ~ 10^{-4} M_sun of circumstellar material which
contributes only a tiny fraction to the total visual extinction (11 mag). In
the case of a YSO, a dynamical ejection process is proposed to explain the
V_LSR difference between CEN34 and M17. Additionally, to match the temperature
and luminosity, we speculate that CEN34 had accumulated the bulk of its mass
with accretion rate > 4x10^{-3} M_sun/yr in a very short time span (~ 10^3
yrs), and currently undergoes a phase of gravitational contraction without any
further mass gain. However, all the aforementioned characteristics of CEN34 are
compatible with an evolved star of 5-7 M_sun and an age of 50-100 Myrs, most
likely a background post-AGB star with a distance between 2.0 kpc and 4.5 kpc.
We consider the latter classification as the more likely interpretation.
Further discrimination between the two possible scenarios should come from the
more strict confinement of CEN34's distance.

problems such as core-collapse and Type Ia supernovae, where single large
condensations of mass must be treated. The standard formulation of multipole
self-gravity suffers from two significant sources of error, which we correct in
the formulation presented in this article. The first source of error is due to
the numerical approximation that effectively places grid cell mass at the
central point of the cell, then computes the gravitational potential at that
point, resulting in a convergence failure of the multipole expansion. We
describe a new scheme that avoids this problem by computing gravitational
potential at cell faces. The second source of error is due to sub-optimal
choice of location for the expansion center, which results in angular power at
high multipole $l$ values in the gravitational field, requiring a high --- and
expensive --- value of multipole cutoff \lmax. By introducing a global measure
of angular power in the gravitational field, we show that the optimal
coordinate for the expansion is the square-density-weighted mean location. We
subject our new multipole self-gravity algorithm to two rigorous test problems:
MacLaurin spheroids for which exact analytic solutions are known, and
core-collapse supernovae. We show that key observables of the core-collapse
simulations, particularly shock expansion, proto-neutron star motion, and
momentum conservation, are extremely sensitive to the accuracy of the multipole
gravity, and the accuracy of their computation is greatly improved by our
reformulated solver.

gamma-ray observatory. It will consist of three classes of telescopes, of
large, medium and small sizes. The small telescopes, of 4 m diameter, will be
dedicated to the observations of the highest energy gamma-rays, above several
TeV. We present the technical characteristics of a single mirror, 4 m diameter,
Davies-Cotton telescope for the CTA and the performance of the sub-array
consisting of the telescopes of this type. The telescope will be equipped with
a fully digital camera based on custom made, hexagonal Geiger-mode avalanche
photodiodes. The development of cameras based on such devices is an RnD since
traditionally photomultipliers are used. The photodiodes are now being
characterized at various institutions of the CTA Consortium. Glass mirrors will
be used, although an alternative is being considered: composite mirrors that
could be adopted if they meet the project requirements. We present a design of
the telescope structure, its components and results of the numerical
simulations of the telescope performance.

field range (x = 0 - 0.15, T up to 480K, H up to 30T) by means of As nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR). An enhanced spin-lattice relaxation rate divided by
temperature, 1/T1T, in underdoped superconducting samples (x = 0.045, 0.05 and
0.075) suggests the presence of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations, which are
strongly reduced in optimally-doped (x = 0.10) and completely absent in
overdoped (x = 0.15) samples. In contrast to previous analysis, Curie-Weiss
fits are shown to be insufficient to describe the data over the whole

of a peak in 1/T1T clearly above the superconducting transition, reflecting a
progressive slowing down of the spin fluctuations down to the superconducting

may either collapse stably into a single droplet or break up into multiple
droplets. The dynamics of the filament are governed by the viscosity and the
aspect ratio, and the initial perturbations of its surface. We find that the
instability of long viscous filaments can be completely explained by the
Rayleigh-Plateau instability, whereas a low viscous filament can also break up
due to end pinching. We analytically derive the transition between stable
collapse and breakup in the Ohnesorge number versus aspect ratio phase space.
Our result is confirmed by numerical simulations based on the slender jet

minimized, and leads to substantially higher Q-factors in the ZnO

simple macroeconomic Agent-Based models (ABM) can reproduce. We propose a
methodology, inspired by statistical physics, that characterizes a model
through its 'phase diagram' in the space of parameters. Our first motivation is
to understand the large macro-economic fluctuations observed in the 'Mark I'
ABM. Our major finding is the generic existence of a phase transition between a
'good economy' where unemployment is low, and a 'bad economy' where
unemployment is high. We introduce a simpler framework that allows us to show
that this transition is robust against many modifications of the model, and is
generically induced by an asymmetry between the rate of hiring and the rate of
firing of the firms. The unemployment level remains small until a tipping
point, beyond which the economy suddenly collapses. If the parameters are such
that the system is close to this transition, any small fluctuation is amplified
as the system jumps between the two equilibria. We have explored several
natural extensions of the model. One is to introduce a bankruptcy threshold,
limiting the leverage of firms. This leads to a rich phase diagram with, in
particular, a region where acute endogenous crises occur, during which the
unemployment rate shoots up before the economy can recover. We also introduce
simple wage policies. This leads to inflation (in the 'good' phase) or
deflation (in the 'bad' phase), but leaves the overall phase diagram of the
model essentially unchanged. We have also started exploring the effect of
simple monetary policies that attempt to contain rising unemployment and defang
crises. We end the paper with general comments on the usefulness of ABMs to
model macroeconomic phenomena, in particular in view of the time needed to
reach a steady state that raises the issue of ergodicity in these models.

Maxwell field equations, we study the oscillation and drift of electron and
positron pairs coherently with fields after these pairs are produced in
external electromagnetic fields. From the electric current of oscillating
pairs, we obtain the energy spectrum of electromagnetic dipole radiation. This
narrow spectrum is so peculiar that the detection of such radiation can
identify pair production and oscillation in strong laser fields. We also obtain
the energy spectrum of gravitational quadrapole radiation from the
energy-momentum tensor of oscillating pairs and fields. Thus, we discuss the
generation of gravitational waves on the basis of rapid development of strong
laser fields.

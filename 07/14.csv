  Delay Estimation method against correlated noise","Refreshing The figures",,,,"physics.ins-det","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, the residual complexity (RC) similarity measure, is employed
for time delay estimation (TDE) in gas pipe leak localization. The properties
of TDE by RC is compared with those of Cross Correlation(CC) and Mutual
Information(MI) similarity measures on our experimental data. The comparison
confirms the advantages of RC relative to CC and MI, in robustness against both
correlated noises and reduction of number of samples. These advantages
originate from not only its mathematical nature of RC similarity measure which
considers inter-dependency but also from broadband frequency of acoustic waves
propagating during gas pipes.

that are central for heat transport within the penumbra, but whose structure is
still not clear. To investigate the fine-scale structure of these filaments, we
perform a depth-dependent inversion of spectropolarimetric data of a sunspot
very close to solar disk center obtained by Hinode (SOT/SP). We have used a
recently developed spatially coupled 2D inversion scheme which allows us to
analyze the fine structure of individual penumbral filaments up to the
diffraction limit of the telescope. Filaments of different sizes in all parts
of penumbra display very similar magnetic field strengths, inclinations and
velocity patterns. The similarities allowed us to average all these filaments
and to extract the physical properties common to all of them. This average
filament shows upflows associated with an upward pointing field at its inner,
umbral end and along its axis, downflows along the lateral edge and strong
downflows in the outer end associated with a nearly vertical, strong and
downward pointing field. The upflowing plasma is significantly hotter than the
downflowing plasma. The hot, tear-shaped head of the averaged filament can be
associated with a penumbral grain. The central part of the filament shows
nearly horizontal fields with strengths of ~1kG. The field above the filament
converges, whereas a diverging trend is seen in the deepest layers near the
head of the filament. We put forward a unified observational picture of a
sunspot penumbral filament. It is consistent with such a filament being a
magneto-convective cell, in line with recent MHD simulations. The uniformity of
its properties over the penumbra sets constraints on penumbral models and
simulations. The complex and inhomogeneous structure of the filament provides a
natural explanation for a number of long-running controversies in the
literature.

digital trigger and readout scheme with smart, digital signal processing, and a
""horizontal"" architecture for the electromechanical implementation. The fully
digital approach, based on commercial FADCs and FPGAs as key components,
provides the option to easily implement different types of triggers as well as
digitization and readout scenarios using identical hardware, by simply changing
the firmware on the FPGAs. At the same time, a large dynamic range and high
resolution of low-amplitude signals in a single readout channel per pixel is
achieved using compression of high amplitude signals in the preamplifier and
signal processing in the FPGA. The readout of the front-end modules into a
camera server is Ethernet-based using standard Ethernet switches. In its
current implementation, data transfer and backend processing rates of ~3.8
GBytes/sec have been achieved. Together with the dead-time-free front end event
buffering on the FPGAs, this permits the cameras to operate at trigger rates of
up to several tens of kHz.
  In the horizontal architecture of FlashCam, the photon detector plane (PDP),
consisting of photon detectors, preamplifiers, high voltage-, control-, and
monitoring systems, is a self-contained unit, which is interfaced through
analogue signal transmission to the digital readout system. The horizontal
integration of FlashCam is expected not only to be more cost efficient, it also
allows PDPs with different types of photon detectors to be adapted to the
FlashCam readout system. This paper describes the FlashCam concept, its
verification process, and its implementation for a 12 m class CTA telescope

molecular gas in an extragalactic star formation region to date (~0.4pc x
0.6pc). The 30Dor-10 cloud north of R136 was mapped in 12CO 2-1, 13CO 2-1, C18O
2-1, 1.3mm continuum, the H30alpha recombination line, and two H2CO 3-2
transitions. Most 12CO emission is associated with small filaments and clumps
(<1pc, ~1000 Msun at the current resolution). Some clumps are associated with
protostars, including ""pillars of creation"" photoablated by intense radiation
from R136. Emission from molecular clouds is often analyzed by decomposition
into approximately beam-sized clumps. Such clumps in 30 Doradus follow similar
trends in size, linewidth, and surface density to Milky Way clumps. The 30
Doradus clumps have somewhat larger linewidths for a given size than predicted
by Larson's scaling relation, consistent with pressure confinement. They extend
to higher surface density at a given size and linewidth compared to clouds
studied at 10pc resolution. These trends are also true of clumps in Galactic
infrared-dark clouds; higher resolution observations of both environments are
required. Consistency of clump masses calculated from dust continuum, CO, and
the virial theorem reveals that the CO abundance in 30 Doradus clumps is not
significantly different from the LMC mean, but the dust abundance may be
reduced by ~2. There are no strong trends in clump properties with distance
from R136; dense clumps are not strongly affected by the external radiation
field, but there is a modest trend towards lower dense clump filling fraction
deeper in the cloud.

of supermassive black holes throughout cosmic time. While this may be true at
high redshifts, at lower redshifts and for the most massive black holes mergers
themselves might add significantly to the mass budget. We evolve SMBHs from $4
> z > 0$ using merger trees derived from hydrodynamical cosmological
simulations of a cluster and void region, scaled to the observed value of the
stellar mass fraction to account for overcooling. Mass gains from gas accretion
proportional to bulge growth and BH-BH mergers are tracked, as are black holes
that remain ""orbiting"" due to insufficient dynamical friction in a merger
remnant, as well as those that are ejected due to gravitational recoil. We find
that gas accretion remains the dominant source of mass accumulation in almost
all SMBHs; mergers contribute $2.5\pm0.1\%$ for all SMBHs in the cluster and
$1.0\pm0.1\%$ in the void since $z = 4$. However, mergers are significant for
massive SMBHs. The fraction of mass accumulated from mergers for central BHs
generally increases for larger values of the host bulge mass: in the void, the
fraction is $2\%$ at $M_{*, bul} = 10^{10} M_{\odot}$, increasing to $4\%$ at
$M_{*, bul} \gtrsim 10^{11} M_{\odot}$, and in the cluster it is $4\%$ at
$M_{*, bul} = 10^{10} M_{\odot}$ and $23\%$ at $10^{12} M_{\odot}$. We find
that $40\%$ of SMBHs and $\approx 8\%$ of the total SMBH mass is found orbiting
in the cluster region at $z = 0$. The existence of orbiting and ejected SMBHs
requires modification of the Soltan argument. We estimate this correction to
the integrated accreted mass density of SMBHs to be in the range $6-21\%$, with
a mean value of $11\pm3\%$. We also calculate the total energy output and
strain from gravitational waves emitted by merging SMBHs, and obtain a signal
potentially detectable by pulsar timing arrays.

and the sum outage capacity for single stream and multi stream SM employing
real or complex encoding for a symmetric interference channel model.
  The techniques considered in this paper are optimal in different operating
regimes. We show that the sum outage capacity can be maximized by reducing the
SM rate to a value less than the maximum allowed value. The optimum SM rate
depends on the number of interferers and the number of available active users.
In particular, we show that the generalized multi-user SM (MU SM) method
employing real-valued encoding provides a performance that is either
comparable, or significantly higher than that of MU SM employing complex
encoding. A combination of analysis and simulation is used to describe the
trade-off between the multiplexing rate and sum outage capacity for different
antenna configurations.

The latter is related to a long millennial solar oscillation and to changes in
the chemical composition of the atmosphere (e.g. aerosol and greenhouse gases).
However, current general circulation climate models, e.g. the CMIP5 GCMs, to be

better hind-casting the observed 1850-2012 climatic patterns. It is found that:
(1) about 50-60% of the warming observed since 1850 and since 1970 was induced

been shown to be a source of internal acoustic excitations. In single stars,
acoustic waves having frequencies below a certain cutoff frequency propagate
nearly adiabatically and are effectively trapped below the photosphere where
they are internally reflected. This reflection essentially occurs where the
local wavelength becomes comparable to the pressure scale height. In close
binary stars, the sound speed is a constant on equipotentials, while the
pressure scale height, which depends on the local effective gravity, varies on
equipotentials and may be much greater near the inner Lagrangian point (L_1).
As a result, waves reaching the vicinity of L_1 may propagate unimpeded into
low density regions, where they tend to dissipate quickly due to non-linear and
radiative effects. We study the three dimensional propagation and enhanced
damping of such waves inside a set of close binary stellar models using a WKB
approximation of the acoustic field. We find that these waves can have much
higher damping rates in close binaries, compared to their non-binary

Lee","Numerical LTL Synthesis for Cyber-Physical Systems","10 pages; work-in-progress report",,,,"cs.SE cs.LO cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are systems that interact with the physical
world via sensors and actuators. In such a system, the reading of a sensor
represents measures of a physical quantity, and sensor values are often reals
ranged over bounded intervals. The implementation of control laws is based on
nonlinear numerical computations over the received sensor values. Synthesizing
controllers fulfilling features within CPS brings a huge challenge to the
research community in formal methods, as most of the works in automatic
controller synthesis (LTL synthesis) are restricted to specifications having a
few discrete inputs within the Boolean domain.
  In this report, we present a novel approach that addresses the above
challenge to synthesize controllers for CPS. Our core methodology, called
numerical LTL synthesis, extends LTL synthesis by using inputs or outputs in
real numbers and by allowing predicates of polynomial constraints to be defined
within an LTL formula as specification. The synthesis algorithm is based on an
interplay between an LTL synthesis engine which handles the pseudo-Boolean
structure, together with a nonlinear constraint validity checker which tests
the (in)feasibility of a (counter-)strategy. The methodology is integrated
within the CPS research framework Ptolemy II via the development of an LTL
synthesis module G4LTL and a validity checker JBernstein. Although we only
target the theory of nonlinear real arithmetic, the use of pseudo-Boolean
synthesis framework also allows an easy extension to embed a richer set of
theories, making the technique applicable to a much broader audience.

of time domain channel taps. Using this model, we show that the considered
equalizers offer a fixed post signal-to-noise-ratio (post-SNR) at the equalizer

Simulation is used to study the bit error rate (BER) performance of both MMSE

synchronization with the relay system also arises. Next, we use two nonlinear

generalized synchronization in discretized time series. Finally, we

its short-time limit. The new ingredient is a generalized Kubo transform which
allows the flux and side dividing surfaces to be the same function of
path-integral space. Choosing this common dividing surface to be a single point
gives a short-time limit which is identical to an expression introduced on
heuristic grounds by Wigner in 1932, but which does not give positive-definite
quantum statistics, causing it to fail while still in the shallow-tunnelling
regime. Choosing the dividing surface to be invariant to imaginary-time
translation gives, uniquely, a short-time limit that gives the correct
positive- definite quantum statistics at all temperatures, and which is
identical to ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) TST. We find that the
RPMD-TST rate is not a strict upper bound to the exact quantum rate, but a good
approximation to one if real-time coherence effects are small. Part II will

characterize a similar bias in our results and show that in specialized cases
it can be eliminated by appropriately centering the kernel density estimate. We

standard hierarchical structure formation scenario through merging of smaller
systems. The substructure frequency in the past and present epoch provides
excellent means for studying the underlying cosmological model. Aims. Using
X-ray observations, we study the substructure frequency as a function of
redshift by quantifying and comparing the fraction of dynamically young
clusters at different redshifts up to z=1.08. We are especially interested in
possible biases due to the inconsistent data quality of the low-z and high-z
samples. Methods. Two well-studied morphology estimators, power ratio P3/P0 and
center shift w, were used to quantify the dynamical state of 129 galaxy
clusters, taking into account the different observational depth and noise
levels of the observations. Results. Owing to the sensitivity of P3/P0 to
Poisson noise, it is essential to use datasets with similar photon statistics
when studying the P3/P0-z relation. We degraded the high-quality data of the
low-redshift sample to the low data quality of the high-z observations and
found a shallow positive slope that is, however, not significant, indicating a
slightly larger fraction of dynamically young objects at higher redshift. The
w-z relation shows no significant dependence on the data quality and gives a
similar result. Conclusions. We find a similar trend for P3/P0 and w, namely a
very mild increase of the disturbed cluster fraction with increasing redshifts.
Within the significance limits, our findings are also consistent with no
evolution.

stochastic rewards $V_1,...,V_n$ and must decide, for each reward $V_i$,
whether to keep it and stop the game or to forfeit the reward forever and
reveal the next value $V_i$. The gambler's goal is to obtain a constant
fraction of the expected reward that the optimal offline algorithm would get.
Recently, prophet inequalities have been generalized to settings where the
gambler can choose $k$ items, and, more generally, where he can choose any
independent set in a matroid. However, all the existing algorithms require the
gambler to know the distribution from which the rewards $V_1,...,V_n$ are
drawn.
  The assumption that the gambler knows the distribution from which
$V_1,...,V_n$ are drawn is very strong. Instead, we work with the much simpler
assumption that the gambler only knows a few samples from this distribution. We
construct the first single-sample prophet inequalities for many settings of
interest, whose guarantees all match the best possible asymptotically,
\emph{even with full knowledge of the distribution}. Specifically, we provide a
novel single-sample algorithm when the gambler can choose any $k$ elements
whose analysis is based on random walks with limited correlation. In addition,
we provide a black-box method for converting specific types of solutions to the
related \emph{secretary problem} to single-sample prophet inequalities, and
apply it to several existing algorithms. Finally, we provide a constant-sample
prophet inequality for constant-degree bipartite matchings.
  We apply these results to design the first posted-price and multi-dimensional
auction mechanisms with limited information in settings with asymmetric
bidders.

effective temperature drop at the interface. The mesoscopic Seebeck coefficient
is approximately proportional to the logarithmic energy derivative of local
density of states at the Fermi energy. We deduced that the effective
temperature drop at the tip-sample junction could vary at a sub-angstrom scale
depending on atom-to-atom interaction at the interface. A computer-based
simulation method of thermoelectric images is proposed, and a point defect in
graphene was identified by comparing experiment and the simulation of
thermoelectric imaging.

Fulde-Ferrell superfluid - in one-dimensional atomic Fermi gases with equal
Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling near s-wave Feshbach resonances. The
realization of such a spin-orbit coupled Fermi system has already been
demonstrated recently by using a two-photon Raman process and the extra
one-dimensional confinement is easy to achieve using a tight two-dimensional
optical lattice. The topological Fulde-Ferrell superfluid phase is
characterized by a nonzero center-of-mass momentum and a non-trivial Berry
phase. By tuning the Rabi frequency and the detuning of Raman laser beams, we
show that such an exotic topological phase occupies a significant part of
parameter space and therefore it could be easily observed experimentally, by
using, for example, momentum-resolved and spatially resolved radio-frequency
spectroscopy.

partial differential equation (RBSPDE for short). Basing on the theory of
backward stochastic partial differential equation and the parabolic capacity

the penalization method, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution
for linear RBSPDE with Lapalacian leading coefficients. With the continuity
approach, we further obtain the well-posedness of general quasi-linear RBSPDEs.
Related results, including It\^o formulas for backward stochastic partial
differential equations with random measures, the comparison principle for
solutions of RBSPDEs and the connections with reflected backward stochastic
differential equations and optimal stopping problems, are addressed as well.

case of the model where the number of ambassadors is always the constant $m$

equation of state and subject to a constraint-violating perturbation. We
compare the evolution of the constraints using the CCZ4 and
Baumgarte-Shibata-Shapiro-Nakamura-Oohara-Kojima (BSSNOK) systems. Second, we

evolve binary neutron star systems over several orbits until the merger, the
formation of a black hole, and up to the ringdown. We show that the CCZ4
formulation is stable in the presence of matter and that the constraint
violations are one or more orders of magnitude smaller than for the BSSNOK

also for neutron star binaries with large initial constraint violations, we
investigate their influence on the errors on physical quantities. We also give
a new, simple and robust prescription for the damping parameter that removes
the instabilities found when using the fully covariant version of CCZ4 in the
evolution of black holes. Overall, we find that at essentially the same
computational costs the CCZ4 formulation provides solutions that are stable and
with a considerably smaller violation of the Hamiltonian constraint than the

external electric field was calculated using Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory.
It was shown that the application of an external electric field E leads to the
appearance of a ferromagnetic phase due to the magnetoelectric coupling. In
particular, electric field application decreases the transition temperature
TAFM to antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase and induces ferromagnetic (FM) phase, so
that at some E field larger than the critical field (Ecr), TFM becomes higher
than TAFM and the FM phase appears. Note that Ecr increases and magnetization
decreases as the temperature increases. The value of the critical field Ecr =
0.40*10^6 V/cm we calculated appeared close to the value Ecr = 0.5*10^6 V/cm
obtained recently by Ryan et al. with the help of density functional theory for
EuTiO3 film under a compressive strain produced by substrate. At the fields E
>0.83*10^6 V/cm, AFM disappears for all considered temperatures and so FM
becomes the only stable magnetic phase. We find that ferromagnetic phase can be
induced by an E-field in other paraelectric antiferromagnet oxides with a
positive AFM-type magnetoelectric (ME) coupling coefficient and negative
FM-type ME coupling coefficient. In particular, the critical E-field was
estimated for another paraelectric antiferromagnet Sr0.7Ba0.3MnO3 as
0.2x10^5V/cm at 0 K. Analysis of the dependence of magnetization and
antimagnetization on the external electric field and the polarization induced
by the field, which yields the magnetoelectric coupling, is reported. The
results show the possibility to control multiferroicity, including the FM and
AFM phases, with help of an electric field application.

{U_i^\Downarrow}_{i=0}^d denote the first and second split decompositions of V.
In an earlier paper we introduced the double lowering operator \psi:V\to V. One
feature of \psi is that both \psi U_i\subseteq U_{i-1} and \psi
U_i^\Downarrow\subseteq U_{i-1}^\Downarrow for 0\leq i\leq d. Define linear

follows. Using \psi,K,B we obtain two actions of Uq(sl2) on V. For each of
these Uq(sl2)-module structures, the Chevalley generator e acts as a scalar
multiple of \psi. For each of the Uq(sl2)-module structures, we compute the
action of the Casimir element on V. We show that these two actions agree. Using
this fact, we express \psi as a rational function of K^{\pm 1},B^{\pm 1} in
several ways. Eliminating \psi from these equations we find that K,B are

Feature selection for graph data is a way to reduce the high number of frequent

structural similarity strategies are not efficient enough in many real-world
applications, besides, the combinatorial nature of graphs makes it
computationally very costly. In order to select a smaller yet structurally

topological representative subgraphs among the frequent ones. Our approach
allows detecting hidden structural similarities that existing approaches are
unable to detect such as the density or the diameter of the subgraph. In
addition, it can be easily extended using any user defined structural or
topological attributes depending on the sought properties. Empirical studies on
real and synthetic graph datasets show that our approach is fast and scalable.

statistics, better than ~3%/\sqrt{E} energy resolution and well understood
energy non-linearity, MH can be determined by analyzing oscillation signals
driven by the atmospheric mass-squared difference in the survival spectrum of
reactor antineutrinos. With such high performance MBRO detectors, oscillation
parameters, such as \sin^22\theta_{12}, \Delta m^2_{21}, and \Delta m^2_{32},
can be measured to sub-percent level, which enables a future test of the PMNS

heavy quarkonia at the intensity and energy frontiers of high energy physics.
We focus primarily on two specific aspects of quarkonium physics for which
significant advances can be expected from experiments at both frontiers. The
first aspect is the spectroscopy of charmonium and bottomonium states above the
open-heavy-flavor thresholds. Experiments at e^+ e^- colliders and at hadron
colliders have discovered many new, unexpected quarkonium states in the last 10
years. Many of these states are surprisingly narrow, and some have electric
charge. The observations of these charged quarkonium states are the first
definitive discoveries of manifestly exotic hadrons. These results challenge
our understanding of the QCD spectrum. The second aspect is the production of
heavy quarkonium states with large transverse momentum. Experiments at the LHC
are measuring quarkonium production with high statistics at unprecedented
values of p_T. Recent theoretical developments may provide a rigorous
theoretical framework for inclusive production of quarkonia at large p_T.
Experiments at the energy frontier will provide definitive tests of this
framework. Experiments at the intensity frontier also provide an opportunity to
understand the exclusive production of quarkonium states.

Truthfulness makes bidders bid their true valuations, simplifying greatly the

numerical simulations. Owing to the nonlinear feedback of cosmic-ray (CR)
acceleration, a downstream state of the modified shock can no longer be
uniquely determined for given upstream parameters. It is known that up to three
distinct solutions exist, which are characterized by the CR production
efficiency as ""efficient"", ""intermediate"" and ""inefficient"" branches. The
stability of these solutions is investigated by performing direct
time-dependent simulations of a two-fluid model. It is found that both the
efficient and inefficient branches are stable even against a large-amplitude
perturbation, while the intermediate one is always unstable and evolves into
the inefficient state as a result of nonlinear time development. This bistable
feature is robust in a wide range of parameters and does not depend on the
injection model. Fully nonlinear time evolution of a hydrodynamic shock with
injection results in the least efficient state in terms of the CR production,
consistent with the bistable feature. This suggests that the CR production
efficiency at supernova remnant shocks may be lower than previously discussed
in the framework of the nonlinear shock acceleration theory considering the

bisimulations, simulation equivalences and preorders between two timed automata
states. We propose a zone based method for deciding these relations in which we
eliminate an explicit product construction of the region graphs or the zone
graphs as in the classical methods. Our method is also generic and can be used
to decide several timed relations. We also present a game characterization for
these timed relations and show that the game hierarchy reflects the hierarchy
of the timed relations. One can obtain an infinite game hierarchy and thus the
game characterization further indicates the possibility of defining new timed
relations which have not been studied yet. The game characterization also helps
us to come up with a formula which encodes the separation between two states
that are not timed bisimilar. Such distinguishing formulae can also be
generated for many relations other than timed bisimilarity.

yields a sequence of dynamical systems. In many cases, such a sequence is
intended to approximate a certain limit case. However, formally defining that
limit turns out to be subject to ambiguity. Depending on the interpretation of
the sequence, i.e. depending on how the behaviors of the systems in the
sequence are related, it may vary what the limit should be. Topologies, and in
particular metrics, define limits uniquely, if they exist. Thus they select one
interpretation implicitly and leave no room for other interpretations. In this
paper, we define limits using category theory, and use the mentioned relations
between system behaviors explicitly. This resolves the problem of ambiguity in
a more controlled way. We introduce a category of prefix orders on executions
and partial history preserving maps between them to describe both discrete and
continuous branching time dynamics. We prove that in this category all
projective limits exist, and illustrate how ambiguity in the definition of
limits is resolved using an example. Moreover, we show how various problems
with known topological approaches are now resolved, and how the construction of
projective limits enables us to approximate continuous time dynamics as a
sequence of discrete time systems.

high-level reasoning and continuous low-level reasoning to address hybrid
planning problems in robotics. We identify four distinct strategies for such an
integration: (i) low-level checks are done for all possible cases in advance
and then this information is used during plan generation, (ii) low-level checks
are done exactly when they are needed during the search for a plan, (iii) first
all plans are computed and then infeasible ones are filtered, and (iv) by means
of replanning, after finding a plan, low-level checks identify whether it is
infeasible or not; if it is infeasible, a new plan is computed considering the
results of previous low- level checks. We perform experiments on hybrid
planning problems in robotic manipulation and legged locomotion domains
considering these four methods of integration, as well as some of their
combinations. We analyze the usefulness of levels of integration in these
domains, both from the point of view of computational efficiency (in time and
space) and from the point of view of plan quality relative to its feasibility.
We discuss advantages and disadvantages of each strategy in the light of
experimental results and provide some guidelines on choosing proper strategies
for a given domain.

this work, the authors propose and implement a novel hybrid framework for
detecting P2P botnets in live network traffic by integrating Neural Networks
with Bayesian Regularization. Bayesian Regularization helps in achieving better
generalization of the dataset, thereby enabling the detection of botnet
activity even of those bots which were never used in training the Neural
Network. Hence such a framework is suitable for detection of newer and unseen
botnets in live traffic of a network. This was verified by testing the
Framework on test data unseen to the Detection module (using untrained botnet

reduce to the standard result of perturbation theory for late recombination

originated at redshifts between equality and recombination i.e. 1100 < z <

algorithm (1962), the proposed-to side W (referred to as women there) can
strategically force the W-optimal stable matching as the M-optimal one by
truncating their preference lists, each woman possibly blacklisting all but one
man. As Gusfield and Irving have already noted in 1989, no results are known
regarding achieving this feat by means other than such preference-list
truncation, i.e. by also permuting preference lists.
  We answer Gusfield and Irving's open question by providing tight upper bounds
on the amount of blacklists and their combined size, that are required by the
women to force a given matching as the M-optimal stable matching, or, more
generally, as the unique stable matching. Our results show that the coalition
of all women can strategically force any matching as the unique stable
matching, using preference lists in which at most half of the women have
nonempty blacklists, and in which the average blacklist size is less than 1.
This allows the women to manipulate the market in a manner that is far more
inconspicuous, in a sense, than previously realized. When there are less women
than men, we show that in the absence of blacklists for men, the women can
force any matching as the unique stable matching without blacklisting anyone,
while when there are more women than men, each to-be-unmatched woman may have
to blacklist as many as all men. Together, these results shed light on the
question of how much, if at all, do given preferences for one side a priori
impose limitations on the set of stable matchings under various conditions. All
of the results in this paper are constructive, providing efficient algorithms

how to design such interactions by looking for extra symmetries via
bosonization/fermionization. We comment on the new ingredients and the
differences of ours compared to Ginsparg-Wilson fermion, Eichten-Preskill, and
Chen-Giedt-Poppitz (CGP) models, and suggest modifying CGP model to have
successful mirror-decoupling. We show a topological non-perturbative proof of

relative intensities amongst the emission lines agree with the gas being
shocked during the interaction of the powerful radio jets with the ambient
medium. The emission from the recombination region acts as a very effective
cooling mechanism, which is supported by the presence of a neutral outflow.
However, the observed intensity is almost an order of magnitude lower than
expected in a pure shock model. So auto-ionizing shock models, in low-density

rediscover the geometrical and physical meaning of the local curvilinear

linear ill-posed problems with respect to an orthonormal basis in a separable
Hilbert space using $\ell^1$ and sublinear penalty terms. In particular, we
show that the corresponding range condition is always satisfied for all basis
elements if the problems are well-posed in a certain weaker topology and the
basis elements are chosen appropriately related to an associated Gelfand
triple. The Radon transform, Symm's integral equation and linear integral
operators of Volterra type are examples for such behaviour, which allows us to
apply convergence rates results for non-sparse solutions, and we further extend

usually exhibit strong finite size and finite measuring time $t_m$ effects. We
discuss how these affect the determination of the full counting statistics for
a general quantum impurity problem. We find that, while there are many methods
available to improve upon finite-size effects, any real-time simulation or
experiment will still be subject to finite time effects: in short size matters,
but time is limiting. We show that the leading correction to the cumulant
generating function (CGF) at zero temperature for single-channel quantum
impurity problems goes as $\ln t_m$ and is universally related to the steady
state CGF itself for non-interacting systems. We then give detailed numerical
evidence for the case of the self-dual interacting resonant level model that
this relation survives the addition of interactions. This allows the
extrapolation of finite measuring time in our numerics to the long-time limit,
to excellent agreement with Bethe-ansatz results.

using discriminators have the advantage of being able to treat several neutron
impacts partially overlapping in time, hence reducing global dead time. A
single neutron impact usually gives rise to several discriminator signals. In
this paper, we introduce an information-theoretical definition of image
resolution. Two point-like spots of neutron impacts with a given distance
between them act as a source of information (each neutron hit belongs to one
spot or the other), and the detector plus signal treatment is regarded as an
imperfect communication channel that transmits this information. The maximal
mutual information obtained from this channel as a function of the distance
between the spots allows to define a calibration-independent measure of
resolution. We then apply this measure to quantify the power of resolution of
different algorithms treating these individual discriminator signals which can
be implemented in firmware. The method is then applied to different detectors
existing at the ILL. Center-of-gravity methods usually improve the resolution
over best-wire algorithms which are the standard way of treating these signals.

approach, we do not need to define or estimate a thickness value for SLMoS2,
which is important due to the substantial controversy in defining this value
for two-dimensional or ultrathin nanostructures such as graphene and nanotubes.
The obtained elastic bending modulus of 9.61 eV in SLMoS2 is significantly
higher than the bending modulus of 1.4 eV in graphene, and is found to be
within the range of values that are obtained using thin shell theory with
experimentally obtained values for the elastic constants of SLMoS2. This
increase in bending modulus as compared to monolayer graphene is attributed,
through our analytic expression, to the finite thickness of SLMoS2.
Specifically, while each monolayer of S atoms contributes 1.75 eV to the
bending modulus, which is similar to the 1.4 eV bending modulus of monolayer
graphene, the additional pairwise and angular interactions between out of plane
Mo and S atoms contribute 5.84 eV to the bending modulus of SLMoS2.

is not forbidden in a general multi- band system but has a rich structure in
the near infrared regime. We distinguish different optical transitions
determined by the superconducting gap (far infrared) and the inter orbital
coupling of the normal state (near infrared). We argue that the low frequency
transitions do not contribute to the Hall conductivity while only the
inter-orbital transitions in the near infrared regime contribute. Finally, we
discuss the difficulties to connect the calculations for the optical Hall
conductivity to the experimental measurement of the Kerr angle. We will compare
different approximations which might lead to conflicting results.

F(M) is a singular affine manifold which contains a distinguished set of

a homeomorphism f : F(M) --> f(F(M)), which restricts to an affine
diffeomorphism away from these vertical lines, and generalizes a construction

several hundred metre diameter since 1976 when a similar size object passed at
0.5 lunar distances. We observed 2005 YU55 from ground with a recently
developed mid-IR camera (miniTAO/MAX38) in N- and Q-band and with the
Submillimeter Array (SMA) at 1.3 mm. In addition, we obtained space
observations with Herschel/PACS at 70, 100, and 160 micron. Our thermal
measurements cover a wide range of wavelengths from 8.9 micron to 1.3 mm and
were taken after opposition at phase angles between -97 deg and -18 deg. We
performed a radiometric analysis via a thermophysical model and combined our
derived properties with results from radar, adaptive optics, lightcurve
observations, speckle and auxiliary thermal data. We find that (308635) 2005
YU55 has an almost spherical shape with an effective diameter of 300 to 312 m
and a geometric albedo pV of 0.055 to 0.075. Its spin-axis is oriented towards
celestial directions (lam_ecl, beta_ecl) = (60 deg +/- 30deg, -60 deg +/- 15
deg), which means it has a retrograde sense of rotation. The analysis of all
available data combined revealed a discrepancy with the radar-derived size. Our
radiometric analysis of the thermal data together with the problem to find a
unique rotation period might be connected to a non-principal axis rotation. A
low to intermediate level of surface roughness (r.m.s. of surface slopes in the
range 0.1 - 0.3) is required to explain the available thermal measurements. We
found a thermal inertia in the range 350-800 Jm^-2s^-0.5K^-1, very similar to
the rubble-pile asteroid (25143) Itokawa and indicating a mixture of low
conductivity fine regolith with larger rocks and boulders of high thermal

cylinder and the same MgB2 rod as inner conductor. By the analysis of the
resonance curves, in the different resonant modes, we have determined the
microwave surface resistance, Rs, of the MgB2 materials as a function of the
temperature and the frequency, in the absence of DC magnetic fields. At T = 4.2
K and f = 2.5 GHz, by a mw pulsed technique, we have determined the quality
factor of the homogeneous cavity as a function of the input power up to a
maximum level of about 40 dBm (corresponding to a maximum peak magnetic field
of about 100 Oe). Contrary to what occurs in many films, Rs of the MgB2
material used does not exhibit visible variations up to an input power level of
about 10 dBm and varies less than a factor of 2 on further increasing the input
power of 30 dB.

primary goal. For most diseases, the underlying genetic model is unknown, and
we study seven robust test statistics for monotone association. For a given
test statistic, there are many ways to calculate a p-value, but in genetic
association studies, calculations have predominantly been based on asymptotic
approximations or on simulated permutations. We show that when the number of
permutations tends to infinity, the permutation p-value approaches the exact
conditional enumeration p-value, and further that calculating the latter
p-value is much more efficient than performing simulated permutations. We then
answer two research questions. (i) Which of the test statistics under study are
the most powerful for monotone genetic models? (ii) Based on test size, power,
and computational considerations, should asymptotic approximations or exact
conditional enumeration be used for calculating p-values? We have studied
case-control sample sizes with 500-5000 cases and 500-15000 controls, and
significance levels from 5e-8 to 0.05, thus our results are applicable to
genetic association studies with only one genetic marker under study,
intermediate follow-up studies, and genome wide association studies. We find
that if all monotone genetic models are of interest, the best performance is
achieved for a test statistics based on the maximum over a range of
Cochrane-Armitage trend tests with different scores and for a constrained
likelihood ratio test. For significance levels below 0.05, asymptotic
approximations may give a test size up to 20 times the nominal level, and
should therefore be used with caution. Further, calculating p-values based on
exact conditional enumeration is a powerful, valid and computationally feasible

  Wireless Information and Power Transfer","Accepted for publication in PIMRC 2013",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we study power allocation for secure communication in a
multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink system with simultaneous
wireless information and power transfer. The receivers are able to harvest
energy from the radio frequency when they are idle. We propose a
multi-objective optimization problem for power allocation algorithm design
which incorporates two conflicting system objectives: total transmit power
minimization and energy harvesting efficiency maximization. The proposed
problem formulation takes into account a quality of service (QoS) requirement
for the system secrecy capacity. Our designs advocate the dual use of
artificial noise in providing secure communication and facilitating efficient
energy harvesting. The multi-objective optimization problem is non-convex and
is solved by a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation approach which results
in an approximate of solution.
  A sufficient condition for the global optimal solution is revealed and the
accuracy of the approximation is examined. To strike a balance between
computational complexity and system performance, we propose two suboptimal
power allocation schemes. Numerical results not only demonstrate the excellent
performance of the proposed suboptimal schemes compared to baseline schemes,
but also unveil an interesting trade-off between energy harvesting efficiency
and total transmit power.

radiation from moving charges implemented directly in CORSIKA. Consequently,
the full complexity of the air-shower physics is taken into account without the
need for approximations or assumptions on the emission mechanism. We present
results of simulations for an unthinned shower performed with CoREAS for both
MHz and GHz frequencies. At MHz frequencies, the simulations predict the
well-known mixture of geomagnetic and charge excess radiation. At GHz
frequencies, the emission is strongly influenced by Cherenkov effects arising
from the varying refractive index in the atmosphere. In addition, a qualitative
difference in the symmetry of the GHz radiation pattern is observed when
compared to the ones at lower frequencies. We also discuss the strong increase
in the ground area subtended by the radio emission when going from
near-vertical to very inclined geometries, making very inclined air showers the
most promising ones for cosmic ray radio detection.

out of a pure hydrogen and helium gas in minihalos of 10^5-10^6 M$_\odot$ .
Cooling and fragmentation is thus regulated via molecular hydrogen. At
densities above 10^8 cm$^{-3}$, the three-body H2 formation rates are
particularly important for making the gas fully molecular. These rates were
considered to be uncertain by at least a few orders of magnitude. We explore
the impact of new accurate three-body H2 formation rates derived by Forrey
(2013) for three different minihalos, and compare to the results obtained with
three-body rates employed in previous studies. The calculations are performed
with the cosmological hydrodynamics code ENZO (release 2.2) coupled with the
chemistry package KROME (including a network for primordial chemistry), which
was previously shown to be accurate in high resolution simulations. While the
new rates can shift the point where the gas becomes fully molecular, leading to
a different thermal evolution, there is no trivial trend in how this occurs.
While one might naively expect the results to be inbetween the calculations
based on Palla et al. (1983) and Abel et al. (2002), the behavior can be close
to the former or the latter depending on the dark matter halo that is explored.
We conclude that employing the correct three-body rates is about as equally
important as the use of appropriate initial conditions, and that the resulting
thermal evolution needs to be calculated for every halo individually.

technology, and applications. To date, most algorithms that aim to find
community structures only focus either on unipartite or bipartite networks. A
unipartite network consists of one set of nodes and a bipartite network
consists of two nonoverlapping sets of nodes with only links joining the nodes
in different sets. However, a third type of network exists, defined here as the
mixture network. Just like a bipartite network, a mixture network also consists
of two sets of nodes, but some nodes may simultaneously belong to two sets,
which breaks the nonoverlapping restriction of a bipartite network. The mixture
network can be considered as a general case, with unipartite and bipartite
networks viewed as its limiting cases. A mixture network can represent not only
all the unipartite and bipartite networks, but also a wide range of real-world
networks that cannot be properly represented as either unipartite or bipartite
networks in fields such as biology and social science. Based on this
observation, we first propose a probabilistic model that can find modules in
unipartite, bipartite, and mixture networks in a unified framework based on the
link community model for a unipartite undirected network [B Ball et al (2011

overlapping and nonoverlapping communities) and apply it to two real-world

regulatory mixture network. The results suggest that our model performs well
for all three types of networks, is competitive with other algorithms for

the resulting model usually has a small number of non-zero entries. Safe
screening, which eliminates the features that are guaranteed to have zero

technique for improving the computational efficiency. Safe screening is gaining
increasing attention since 1) solving sparse learning formulations usually has
a high computational cost especially when the number of features is large and
2) one needs to try several regularization parameters to select a suitable
model. In this paper, we propose an approach called ""Sasvi"" (Safe screening
with variational inequalities). Sasvi makes use of the variational inequality
that provides the sufficient and necessary optimality condition for the dual
problem. Several existing approaches for Lasso screening can be casted as
relaxed versions of the proposed Sasvi, thus Sasvi provides a stronger safe
screening rule. We further study the monotone properties of Sasvi for Lasso,
based on which a sure removal regularization parameter can be identified for
each feature. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data sets are
reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Sasvi for Lasso
screening.

probabilistically and employ a WKB ansatz to approximate their rate of
occurrence. This results in the generation of a two-point boundary value
problem that models the interaction of the state variables and the most likely
noise force required to induce a rare event. The resulting equations of motion
of describing the phenomenon are shown to be singularly perturbed. Vastly
different time scales among the variables are leveraged to reduce the dimension
and predict the dynamics on the slow manifold in a deterministic setting. The
resulting constrained equations of motion may be used to directly compute an
exponent that determines the probability of rare events.
  To verify the theory, a stochastic damped Duffing oscillator with three
equilibrium points (two sinks separated by a saddle) is analyzed. The predicted

anomalous since the main barrier for surface segregation of Cr in these alloys
arises not from the topmost surface layer but from the subsurface layer where
the solution energy of Cr is much more endothermic as compared to the topmost
surface layer. The Fe-Cr alloys are candidate structural materials for the new
generation of nuclear reactors. The surfaces of these alloys will be exposed to
hydrogen or its isotopes in these reactors, and although hydrogen is soluble
neither in Fe nor in Fe-Cr alloys, it is known that the adsorption energy of
hydrogen on the surface of iron is not only exothermic but relatively large.
This clearly raises the question of the effect of the hydrogen adsorbed on the
surface of iron on the segregation behavior of chromium towards the surface of
iron. In this paper we show, on the basis of our ab initio density functional
theory calculations, that the presence of hydrogen on the surface of iron leads
to a considerably reduced barrier for Cr segregation to both the topmost
surface layer and the subsurface layer, but the subsurface layer still controls
the barrier for surface segregation. This reduction in the barrier for surface
segregation is due to the nature of the Cr-H couple that acts in a complex and
synergistic manner. The presence of Cr enhances the exothermic nature of
hydrogen adsorption that in turn leads to a reduced barrier for surface
segregation. These results should be included in the multiscale modeling of
Fe-Cr alloys.

oscillations are theoretically predicted to be excited in those stars as well.
To search for such stochastic oscillations we organised a spectroscopic
multi-site campaign for the bright, metal-rich delta Sct star rho Puppis. We
obtained a total of 2763 high-resolution spectra using four telescopes. We
discuss the reduction and analysis with the iodine cell technique, developed
for searching for low-amplitude radial velocity variations, in the presence of
high-amplitude variability. Furthermore, we have determined the angular
diameter of rho Puppis to be 1.68 \pm 0.03 mas, translating into a radius of
3.52 \pm 0.07Rsun. Using this value, the frequency of maximum power of possible
solar-like oscillations, is expected at ~43 \pm 2 c/d (498 \pm 23 muHz). The
dominant delta Scuti-type pulsation mode of rho Puppis is known to be the
radial fundamental mode which allows us to determine the mean density of the
star, and therefore an expected large frequency separation of 2.73 c/d (31.6
muHz). We conclude that 1) the radial velocity amplitudes of the delta Scuti
pulsations are different for different spectral lines; 2) we can exclude
solar-like oscillations to be present in rho Puppis with an amplitude per
radial mode larger than 0.5 m/s.

overcome some intrinsic limitations of self-consistent mean-field schemes
applied to nuclear systems, such as the incapability to produce some properties
of single-particle states (e.g. spectroscopic factors), as well as of
collective states (e.g. their damping width and their gamma decay to the ground

fitted at the mean-field level, one should aim at refitting them including the

created a catalogue of point sources and sources with moderate extent. Sources
with high extent (>40"") have been presented in a companion paper. We searched
for point sources in the EPIC images using sliding-box and maximum-likelihood
techniques and classified the sources using hardness ratios, X-ray variability,
and their multi-wavelength properties. The catalogue comprises 3053 unique
X-ray sources with a median position uncertainty of 1.3"" down to a flux limit
for point sources of ~10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in the (0.2-4.5) keV band,
corresponding to 5x10^33 erg s^-1 for sources in the SMC. We discuss
statistical properties, like the spatial distribution, X-ray colour diagrams,
luminosity functions, and time variability. We identified 49 SMC high-mass
X-ray binaries (HMXB), four super-soft X-ray sources (SSS), 34 foreground
stars, and 72 active galactic nuclei (AGN) behind the SMC. In addition, we
found candidates for SMC HMXBs (45) and faint SSSs (8) as well as AGN (2092)

particles to ultra-high energies. Acceleration of protons in the forward shock
of the highly relativistic GRB blastwave allows PeV--EeV neutrino production by
photopion interactions of ultra-high energy protons with X-ray to optical
photons of the GRB afterglow emission. Four different blastwave evolution
scenarios are considered: adiabatic and fully radiative blastwaves in a
constant density circumburst medium and in a wind environment with the particle
density in the wind decreasing inversley proportional to the square of the
radius from the center of the burst. The duration of the neutrino flux depends
on the evolution of the blastwave, and can last up to a day in the case of an
adibatic blastwave in a constant density medium. Neutrino fluxes from the three
other blastwave evolution scenarios are also calculated. Diffuse neutrino
fluxes calculated using the observed rate of long-duration GRBs are consistent
with the recent IceCube upper limit on the prompt GRB neutrino flux below PeV.
The diffuse neutrino flux needed to explain the two neutrino events at PeV
energies recently detected by IceCube can partially come from the presented GRB
blastwave diffuse fluxes. Future observations by IceCube and upcoming huge
radio Askaryan experiments will be able to probe the flux models presented here
or constrain the GRB blastwave properties.

widely used for fitting the distribution of temperatures at which water

assumption was that each droplet contained many nucleation sites, and that
freezing occurred due to the nucleation site with the highest freezing
temperature. The fact that freezing occurs due to the maximum value out of
large number of nucleation temperatures, means that we can apply the results of
what is called extreme-value statistics. This is the statistics of the extreme,
i.e., maximum or minimum, value of a large number of random variables. Here we
use the results of extreme-value statistics to show that we can generalise
Levine's model to produce the most general singular model possible. We show
that when a singular model is a good approximation, the distribution of
freezing temperatures should always be given by what is called the generalised
extreme-value distribution. In addition, we also show that the distribution of
freezing temperatures for droplets of onesize, can be used to make predictions
for the scaling of the median nucleation temperature with droplet size, and
vice versa.

We develop a model, ForeCAT (Forecasting a CME's Altered Trajectory), of CME
deflection due to magnetic forces. ForeCAT includes CME expansion, a three-part
propagation model, and the effects of drag on the CME's deflection. Given the
background solar wind conditions, the launch site of the CME, and the
properties of the CME (mass, final propagation speed, initial radius, and
initial magnetic strength), ForeCAT predicts the deflection of the CME. Two
different magnetic backgrounds are considered: a scaled background based on
type II radio burst profiles and a Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS)
background. For a scaled background where the CME is launched from an active
region located between a CH and streamer region the strong magnetic gradients
cause a deflection of 8.1 degrees in latitude and 26.4 degrees in longitude for
a 1e15 g CME propagating out to 1 AU. Using the PFSS background, which captures
the variation of the streamer belt position with height, leads to a deflection
of 1.6 degrees in latitude and 4.1 degrees in longitude for the control case.
Varying the CME's input parameters within observed ranges leads to the majority
of CMEs reaching the streamer belt within the first few solar radii. For these
specific backgrounds, the streamer belt acts like a potential well that forces
the CME into an equilibrium angular position.

stability against crystallization of this ""bcc zone"" is due to the frustration

Our study suggests that when the global structure is a mixed crystal where a
single species contributes to both the crystal forms and where the two crystal
forms have large difference in some order parameter related to that species

frustration makes the systems good glass former. When $x_A$ is further

barrier, not only for the segregation of Cr from the bulk to the surface, but
also for its diffusion from the surface into the bulk. This means that the
topmost layer alone cannot be used to determine the barrier for Cr segregation
(the segregation energy), which is determined in these alloys by the subsurface
layer. We present the results of our ab initio electronic structure
calculations on the segregation of Cr as an impurity in Fe, which shed some
light on the origin of this anomalous behavior. We find that the interaction of
a Cr atom situated in the subsurface layer, in contrast to those in the other
layers, is quite complex with its nearest neighbor Fe atoms due to the
magnetism of both Fe and Cr, leading to a highly unfavorable electronic
structure. This in turn leads to a large endothermic energy of solution of Cr
in the subsurface layer. These results are important for a proper understanding
of the properties of the technologically important class of Fe-Cr steels with
low concentrations of chromium.

important role in this proof. The first is the classical theory of association
schemes, applied to the average and variance of that random matrix. The second
is a new large deviation inequality for matrix-valued polynomials. Our new tail

  Proceedings C1304143",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Gamma-ray bursts (GRB) are extremely energetic events and produce highly
diverse light curves. Light curves are believed to be resulting from internal
shocks reflecting the activities of the GRB central engine. Hence their
temporal studies can potentially lead to an understanding of the GRB central
engine and its evolution. The light curve variability time scale is an
interesting parameter which most models attribute to a physical origin e.g.,
central engine activity, clumpy circum-burst medium, or relativistic
turbulence. We develop a statistical method to estimate the GRB minimum
variability time scale (MVT) for long and short GRBs detected by GBM. We find
that the MVT of short bursts is distinctly shorter than that of long GRBs
supporting the possibility of a more compact central engine of the former. We
also find that MVT estimated by this method is consistent with the shortest
rise time of the fitted pulses. Hence we use the fitted pulse rise times to
study the evolution of burst variability time scale. Variability time coupled
with the highest energy photon detected in turn related to the minimum bulk
Lorentz factor of the relativistic shell emitted by the inner engine. %Using
this we relate the GRB spectral evolution to the evolution of the variability
time scale.

one repeated the process of collecting the data the new data set would be
somewhat different from the original. Therefore, a statistical method, a map
$\Phi$ taking a data set $x$ to a point in some space F, should be stable at
$x$: Small perturbations in $x$ should result in a small change in $\Phi(x)$.
Otherwise, $\Phi$ is useless at $x$ or -- and this is important -- near $x$. So
one doesn't want $\Phi$ to have ""singularities,"" data sets $x$ such that the
the limit of $\Phi(y)$ as $y$ approaches $x$ doesn't exist. (Yes, the same
issue arises elsewhere in applied math.)
  However, broad classes of statistical methods have topological obstructions
of continuity: They must have singularities. We show why and give lower bounds
on the Hausdorff dimension, even Hausdorff measure, of the set of singularities
of such data maps. There seem to be numerous examples.
  We apply mainly topological methods to study the (topological) singularities
of functions defined (on dense subsets of) ""data spaces"" and taking values in
spaces with nontrivial homology. At least in this book, data spaces are usually
compact manifolds. The purpose is to gain insight into the numerical
conditioning of statistical description, data summarization, and inference and
learning methods. We prove general results that can often be used to bound
below the dimension of the singular set. We apply our topological results to
develop lower bounds on Hausdorff measure of the singular set. We apply these
methods to the study of plane fitting and measuring location of data on
spheres.

catalogs and apply it to the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS). The
algorithm is developed in a Bayesian framework and, contrary to most
dwarf-galaxy-search codes, makes use of both the spatial and color-magnitude
information of sources in a probabilistic approach. Accounting for the
significant contamination from the Milky Way foreground and from the structured
stellar halo of the Andromeda galaxy, we recover all known dwarf galaxies in
the PAndAS footprint with high significance, even for the least luminous ones.
Some Andromeda globular clusters are also recovered and, in one case,
discovered. We publish a list of the 143 most significant detections yielded by
the algorithm. The combined properties of the 39 most significant isolated
detections show hints that at least some of these trace genuine dwarf galaxies,
too faint to be individually detected. Follow-up observations by the community
are mandatory to establish which are real members of the Andromeda satellite
system. The search technique presented here will be used in an upcoming
contribution to determine the PAndAS completeness limits for dwarf galaxies.
Although here tuned to the search of dwarf galaxies in the PAndAS data, the
algorithm can easily be adapted to the search for any localised overdensity
whose properties can be modeled reliably in the parameter space of any catalog.

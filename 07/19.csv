collapse of rare, large density fluctuations. They have never been observed,
but this fact is enough to constrain the amplitude of fluctuations on very
small scales which cannot be otherwise probed. Because PBHs form only in very
rare large fluctuations, the number of PBHs formed is extremely sensitive to
changes in the shape of the tail of the fluctuation distribution - which
depends on the amount of non-Gaussianity present. We first study how local
non-Gaussianity of arbitrary size up to fifth order affects the abundance and
constraints from PBHs, finding that they depend strongly on even small amounts
of non-Gaussianity and the upper bound on the allowed amplitude of the power
spectrum can vary by several orders of magnitude. The sign of the non-linearity
parameters (f_{NL}, g_{NL}, etc) are particularly important. We also study the
abundance and constraints from PBHs in the curvaton scenario, in which case the
complete non-linear probability distribution is known, and find that truncating
to any given order (i.e. to order f_{NL} or g_{NL}, etc) does not give accurate
results.

parametric modelling of galaxy surface-brightness profiles, which we have
incorporated into the widely used software GALFIT. Our new method, named
GALFITM, extends GALFIT3's current single-band fitting process by
simultaneously using multiple images of the same galaxy to constrain a
wavelength-dependent model. Each standard profile parameter may vary as a
function of wavelength, with a user-definable degree of smoothness, from
constant to fully free. The performance of GALFITM is evaluated by fitting
elliptical S\'ersic profiles to ugriz imaging data for 4026 galaxies,
comprising the original SDSS imaging for 163 low redshift (v < 7000 kms)
galaxies and 3863 artificially redshifted (0.01 < z < 0.25) images of the same
galaxies.
  Comparing results from single-band and multi-band techniques, we show that
GALFITM significantly improves the extraction of information, particularly from
bands with low signal-to-noise ratio (e.g., u and z SDSS bands) when combined
with higher signal-to-noise images. We also study systematic trends in the
recovered parameters, particularly S\'ersic index, that appear when one
performs measurements of the same galaxies at successively higher redshifts. We
argue that it is vital that studies investigating the evolution of galaxy
structure are careful to avoid or correct for these biases.
  The resulting multi-band photometric structural parameters for our sample of
163 galaxies are provided. We demonstrate the importance of considering
multi-band measurements by showing that the S\'ersic indices of spiral galaxies
increase to redder wavelengths, as expected for composite bulge-disk systems.
Finally, for the ellipticals in our sample, which should be well-represented by
single-S\'ersic models, we compare our measured parameters to those from
previous studies.

devices such as inductors, transformers, and microwave absorbing materials
among others. Due to this, it is advisable to study the magnetic permeability
of a ferrite as a function of frequency.
  When an excitation that corresponds to a harmonic magnetic field \textbf{H}
is applied to the system, this system responds with a magnetic flux density
\textbf{B}; the relation between these two vectors can be expressed as
\textbf{B}=$\mu(\omega)$ \textbf{H} . Where $\mu$ is the magnetic permeability.
  In this paper, ferrites were considered linear, homogeneous, and isotropic
materials. A magnetic permeability model was applied to NiZn ferrites doped
with Yttrium.
  The parameters of the model were adjusted using the Genetic Algorithm. In the
computer science field of artificial intelligence, Genetic Algorithms and
Machine Learning does rely upon nature's bounty for both inspiration nature's
and mechanisms. Genetic Algorithms are probabilistic search procedures which
generate solutions to optimization problems using techniques inspired by
natural evolution, such as inheritance, mutation, selection, and crossover.
  For the numerical fitting usually is used a nonlinear least square method,
this algorithm is based on calculus by starting from an initial set of variable
values. This approach is mathematically elegant compared to the exhaustive or
random searches but tends easily to get stuck in local minima. On the other
hand, random methods use some probabilistic calculations to find variable sets.
They tend to be slower but have greater success at finding the global minimum

effective theory at the weak scale $v=246\,{\rm GeV}$ of some unknown dynamics

emerging as a pseudo-Goldstone boson. The symmetry breaking scale $\Lambda$ is
taken to be at $4\pi v$ or above. We review the leading-order Lagrangian within
this framework, which is nonrenormalizable in general. A chiral Lagrangian can
then be constructed based on a loop expansion. A systematic power counting is
derived and used to identify the classes of counterterms that appear at one
loop order. With this result the complete Lagrangian is constructed at
next-to-leading order, ${\cal O}(v^2/\Lambda^2)$. This Lagrangian is the most
general effective description of the Standard Model containing a light scalar
boson, in general with strong dynamics of electroweak symmetry breaking.
Scenarios such as the SILH ansatz or the dimension-6 Lagrangian of a linearly
realized Higgs sector can be recovered as special cases.

Lidar Division, CEILAP (CITEDEF-CONICET) in the frame of the Argentinean

characteristics of the atmospheric aerosol extinction profiles to provide
better transmission calculations at the future CTA site. This lidar emits short
laser pulses of 7-9 ns at 355, 532 and 1064 nm at 50 Hz with nominal energy of
125 mJ at 1064 nm. This wavelengths are also used to retrieve the atmospheric
(air, aerosol and clouds) backscattered radiation in the UV, VIS and IR ranges.
Raman capabilities were added in the UV and VIS wavelengths to retrieve the
spectral characteristics of the aerosol extinction and the water vapor profile.
Due to the expected low aerosol optical depth of the future site, the short
observation period as well as the extension of the observation, an enhanced
collection area is required. This system uses six 40 cm f/2.5 newtonian
telescopes to avoid dealing with bigger mirror deformation, aberration issues
and higher costs that imply the use of a single mirror with the same collection
surface. In addition, dismounting of single mirrors for replacement or
recoating will affect slightly the performance but not the operation. The
additional alignment procedure has been solved by an automatic mirror alignment
to follow the line of sight of the observation during the acquisition period.
The system was designed to operate in hard environmental conditions, as it is
completely exposed to the outside weather conditions, when its shelter is fully
opened to provide 360{\deg} observations.

of states on pieces of hypersurfaces in the standard formalism. From the point
of view of geometric quantization the problem lies in the non-locality of the
complex structures associated to hypersurfaces in standard quantization. We
show that using a weakened version of the positive formalism puts this problem
into a new perspective. This is a local TQFT type formalism based on
super-operators and mixed state spaces rather than on amplitudes and pure state
spaces as the one of Atiyah-Segal. In particular, we show that in the case of
purely fermionic degrees of freedom the complex structure can be dispensed with
when the notion of state is suitably generalized. These generalized states do
localize on compact hypersurfaces with boundaries. For the simplest case of
free fermionic fields we embed this in a rigorous and functorial quantization
scheme yielding a local description of the quantum theory. Crucially, no
classical data is needed beyond the structures evident from a Lagrangian
setting. When the classical data is augmented with complex structures on
hypersurfaces, the quantum data correspondingly augment to the full positive
formalism. This scheme is applicable to field theory in curved spacetime, but
also to field theories without metric background.

property of lenses that is commonly used for the far field measurement. We
consider a simple optical setup in which the far-field intensity pattern of a

the back focal plane of a thin lens. Using Fresnel diffraction formula and
numerical computations, we investigate the influence of a slight longitudinal
mispositioning of the CCD camera. Considering a coherent gaussian beam, we show
that a tiny error in the position of the CCD camera can produce a narrowing of
the transverse pattern instead of the anticipated and well-understood
broadening. This phenomenon is robust enough to persist for incoherent beams
strongly modified by the presence of noise. The existence of this phenomenon
has important consequences for the design and the realization of experiments in
the field of optical wave turbulence in which equilibrium spectra reached by
incoherent waves can only be determined from a careful far-field analysis. In
particular, the unexpected narrowing of the far field may be mistaken for the
remarkable phenomenon of classical condensation of waves. Finally, we show that
the finite-size of optical components used in experiments produces diffraction
patterns having wings decaying in a way comparable to the Rayleigh-Jeans
distribution reached by incoherent wave systems at thermodynamical equilibrium.

estimation of systematic errors in the data and the correction for such errors.
A stochastic error (noise) model is assumed, and in most cases, this underlying
model is assumed to be Gaussian. However, outliers in the data due to
interference or due to errors in the sky model would have adverse effects on
processing based on a Gaussian noise model. Most of the shortcomings of
calibration such as the loss in flux or coherence, and the appearance of
spurious sources, could be attributed to the deviations of the underlying noise
model. In this paper, we propose to improve the robustness of calibration by
using a noise model based on Student's t distribution. Student's t noise is a
special case of Gaussian noise when the variance is unknown. Unlike Gaussian
noise model based calibration, traditional least squares minimization would not
directly extend to a case when we have a Student's t noise model. Therefore, we
use a variant of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, called the
Expectation-Conditional Maximization Either (ECME) algorithm when we have a
Student's t noise model and use the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm in the
maximization step. We give simulation results to show the robustness of the
proposed calibration method as opposed to traditional Gaussian noise model
based calibration, especially in preserving the flux of weaker sources that are
not included in the calibration model.

equation to predict the local normal component of the pressure tensor. Our
approach yields a general equation for predicting the normal pressure of
confined fluids and it satisfies the exact bulk thermodynamics equation when
the pore width approaches infinity. As two basic examples, we report the
solution of the general equation for hard-sphere (HS) and Lennard-Jones (LJ)
fluids confined between two parallel-structureless hard walls. To do so, we use
the modified fundamental measure theory (mFMT) to obtain the normal pressure
for hard-sphere confined fluid and mFMT incorporated with the Rosenfeld
perturbative DFT for the LJ fluid. Effects of different variables including
pore width, bulk density and temperature on the behavior of normal pressure are
studied and reported. Our predicted results show that in both HS and LJ cases
the confined fluids normal pressure has an oscillatory behavior and the number
of oscillations increases with bulk density and temperature. The oscillations
also become broad and smooth with pore width at a constant temperature and bulk
density. In comparison with the HS confined fluid, the values of normal
pressure for the LJ confined fluid as well as its oscillations at all distances

the flat-space limit. We give a preliminary discussion of a MHV formalism for
more general amplitudes obtained from the conformal gravity twistor action in

Excellent agreement with a full range of observational data is obtained for a
model in which a dark-matter-rich dwarf spheroidal, whose trajectory lies on
the thin plane of corotating satellites of M31, is accreted from its turnaround
radius of about 200 kpcs into M31 at approximately 3 Gyrs ago. The satellite is
disrupted as it orbits in the potential well of the galaxy and forms the giant
stream and in return heats and warps the disk of M31. We show that our
cosmologically-motivated model is favoured by the kinematic data over the
phenomenological models in which the satellite starts its infall from a close
distance of M31. Our model predicts that the remnant of the disrupted satellite
resides in the region of the North-Eastern shelf of M31. The results here

enhanced due to reduced dimensionality and strong frustration. One long sought
example is the resonating-valence-bond (RVB) state, where atomic magnetic
moments are strongly correlated but do not order or freeze even in the limit of
T -> 0. The RVB ground state does not break conventional symmetries, such as
lattice translation or spin-rotation. The realization of such a quantum spin
liquid in two-dimensions would represent a new state of matter. It is believed
that spin liquid physics plays a role in the phenomenon of high-Tc
superconductivity, and the topological properties of the spin liquid state may
have applications in the field of quantum information. We present neutron
scattering measurements of the spin excitations on single crystal samples of
the spin-1/2 kagom\'{e} lattice antiferromagnet ZnCu3(OD)6Cl2 (also called
herbertsmithite). Our observation of a spinon continuum in a two-dimensional
magnet is remarkable first. The results serve as a key fingerprint of the
quantum spin liquid state in herbertsmithite.

Strong Equivalence Principle (SEP) and change the dynamics of self-bound
stellar systems moving in space-varying background gravitational fields. We
study two kinds of re-virialisation of the stellar systems: the violent phase
transition and the adiabatic phase transition for systems moving on radial
orbits, where the external field evolves from strong to weak and whose
corresponding dynamics changes from Newtonian to Milgromian. We find that the
time scale for the phase tranformation from Newtonian to Milgromian gravity
lies only within one to a few crossing times for low density globular clusters
with masses ranging from $10^4\msun$ to $10^6\msun$. Thus a globular cluster
can appear frozen in the Newtonian regime despite being in the Milgromian
regime for not longer than a few crossing times. We also study the kinematics
and anisotropy profiles of the systems. The velocity dispersions of the systems
are larger after the phase transitions, especially for the outer regions of the
stellar systems. Moreover, the isotropic systems become radially anisotropic,
especially for the outer parts, after the process caused by the dynamical phase
transition. Deeper Milgromian systems have more radially anisotropic velocity
dispersion functions. We also find that the final profiles of density, velocity
dispersion and anisotropy do not depend on the details of the phase transition.
I.e., the mass distribution and kinematics of the end-states of the globular
clusters do not depend on the rapidity of the transition from Newtonian to
Milgromian gravity. Thus, the transition from the Newtonian to the Milgromian
regime naturally induces a significant radially anisotropic velocity
distribution in a globular cluster.

now have access to physical observables that may constrain the theory of
inflation through the non-Gaussianity (NG) signatures in the cosmic microwave
background radiation and the distribution of large-scale structure. Numerical
modeling of the NG signals from different inflation models is essential to
correctly interpret current and near future data from large-scale structure
surveys. In this study, we use high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical
simulations to investigate the effects of primordial NG on the formation and
evolution of galaxies from the cosmic dawn to the present day. Focusing on the
local type primordial NG, we find that it may affect the formation history of
stars and black holes in galaxies, and their distribution. Compared to the
Gaussian case, large non-Gaussian potential with $f_{NL} \gtrsim 10^3$ leads to
earlier collapse of the first structures, more massive galaxies especially at
high redshifts, stronger clustering of galaxies, and higher halo bias. However,
for smaller NG with $f_{NL} \lesssim 10^2$, the effect is significantly weaker.
Observations of the distribution and properties of high-redshift, rare objects
such as the first galaxies and quasars may provide further constraints on the
primordial NG.

existence of (averaged) fractal curvatures and related fractal curvature
measures in the generic case when the k-th curvature measure C_k(F_e,.) scales
like e^(k-D), where D ist the Minkowski dimension of F. In the present paper we
study the nongeneric situation when the scaling exponents do not coincide with
the dimension. We demonstrate that the possibilities for nongeneric behaviour
are rather limited and introduce the notion of local flatness, which allows a
geometric characterization of nongenericy in R and R^2. We expect local
flatness to be characteristic also in higher dimensions.
  The results enlighten the geometric meaning of the scaling exponents.

design, it is necessary to understand and predict the AC loss. This article
analises the AC loss in magnet-like coils under DC bias contribution
super-imposed to the AC current. The analysis is based on a numerical model
that takes the interaction between magnetization currents in all turns into
account. The studied example is a stack of 32 pancake coils with 200 turns each
made of thin tape, such as $Re$BCO coated conductor. We present the current
density, the instantaneous power loss, and loss per cycle. We have found that
the loss increases with the DC bias current. The instantaneous power loss is
the largest in the initial rise of the the AC current. In following cycles, the
power loss is higher in the current increase than in the decrease. The loss per
cycle is the largest at the end pancakes. In conclusion, the highest cooling
power should be supplied to the top and bottom pancakes and during current
rise, specially the initial one. The presented model has a high potential to
predict the AC loss in magnet-size coils, useful for their design.

(BSG) progenitor model, however, can explain the duration of ULGRBs. Moreover,
SLSN-like bump can be attributed to the so-called cocoon-fireball photospheric
emissions (CFPEs). Since a large cocoon is inevitably produced during the
relativistic jet piercing though the BSG envelope, this component can be a
smoking-gun evidence of BSG model for ULGRBs. In this paper, we examine u, g,
r, i, and J-band light curves of three ULGRBs and demonstrate that they can be
fitted quite well by our BSG model with the appropriate choices of the jet
opening angle and the number density of the ambient gas. In addition, we
predict that for 121027A, SLSN-like bump could have been observed for ~ 20 - 80
days after the burst. We also propose that some SLSNe might be CFPEs of
off-axis ULGRBs without visible prompt emission.

one possibility to explain the observed properties of our Universe without
invoking a cosmological constant. Numerous proposals for such modified gravity
cosmologies exist, but often their consequences for structure formation in the
non-linear sector are not yet accurately known. In this work, we employ
high-resolution numerical simulations of f(R)-gravity models coupled with a
semi-analytic model (SAM) for galaxy formation to obtain detailed predictions
for the evolution of galaxy properties. The f(R)-gravity models imply the
existence of a `fifth-force', which is however locally suppressed, preserving
the successes of general relativity on solar system scales. We show that dark
matter haloes in f(R)-gravity models are characterized by a modified virial
scaling with respect to the LCDM scenario, reflecting a higher dark matter
velocity dispersion at a given mass. This effect is taken into account in the
SAM by an appropriate modification of the mass--temperature relation. We find
that the statistical properties predicted for galaxies (such as the stellar
mass function and the cosmic star formation rate) in f(R)-gravity show
generally only very small differences relative to LCDM, smaller than the
dispersion between the results of different SAM models, which can be viewed as
a measure of their systematic uncertainty. We also demonstrate that galaxy bias
is not able to disentangle between f(R)-gravity and the standard cosmological
scenario. However, f(R)-gravity imprints modifications in the linear growth
rate of cosmic structures at large scale, which can be recovered from the
statistical properties of large galaxy samples.

to multiplying both the LSST coverage area and the training sets by \alpha, and
reducing all systematics by a factor of 1/sqrt(\alpha), advantages that are

These new discoveries opens the question of the nature of SGRs/AXPs, emerging
alternative scenarios, in particular the white dwarf (WD) pulsar model. These
astronomical observations have based an alternative description of the

reliable evaluation of hadronic matrix elements of axial and vector currents
which can be done with Lattice QCD. The tiniest entry, |V_{ub}|, can be
estimated independently from B to tau nu and B to pi l nu decays. The ALPHA
collaboration has undertaken the effort to evaluate non-perturbatively the
decay constant f_B and the f^+(q) form factor for q^2 close to q_{max}^2
entering these determinations. Since for the b quark m_b >> a^{-1} for
available lattice sizes, an effective description of the b quark is necessary.
HQET provides an example of the latter. As any effective theory, HQET is
predictive only when a set of parameters have been determined through a process
called matching. The non-perturbative matching procedure applied by the ALPHA
collaboration consists of 19 matching conditions needed to fix all the relevant
parameters at order 1/m_B of the HQET action and the axial and vector currents.
We present a study of one-loop corrections to two representative matching
conditions. Our results enable us to quantify the quality of the observables
used in the matching procedure.

induced scale dependence that varies about the global shape. If tensor modes
are coupled to long wavelength modes of a second field, the locally observed
tensor power and spectral index can also vary. All of these effects, which can
be introduced in models where the observed non-Gaussianity is consistent with
bounds from the Planck satellite, loosen the constraints that observations
place on the parameters of theories of inflation with mode coupling. We suggest
observational constraints that future measurements could aim for to close this

recent years. However, existing approaches do not adequately address two key
challenges: (a) the ability to tackle problems with a large number (say

this paper, we directly address both these problems by studying the multi-label
problem in a generic empirical risk minimization (ERM) framework. Our
framework, despite being simple, is surprisingly able to encompass several
recent label-compression based methods which can be derived as special cases of
our method. To optimize the ERM problem, we develop techniques that exploit the
structure of specific loss functions - such as the squared loss function - to
offer efficient algorithms. We further show that our learning framework admits
formal excess risk bounds even in the presence of missing labels. Our risk
bounds are tight and demonstrate better generalization performance for low-rank
promoting trace-norm regularization when compared to (rank insensitive)
Frobenius norm regularization. Finally, we present extensive empirical results
on a variety of benchmark datasets and show that our methods perform

acoustic wavefields measured on the structure's surface by means of a scanning

with low rank plus outlier modeling, to identify a priori unknown deviations in
the propagating wavefields caused by material inhomogeneities or defects, using
virtually no knowledge of the structural and material properties of the medium.
This characteristic makes the approach particularly suitable for diagnostics
scenarios where the mechanical and material models are complex, unknown, or
unreliable. We demonstrate our approach in a simulated environment using
benchmark point and line defect localization problems based on propagating
flexural waves in a thin plate.

the Fermi satellite whose associated afterglow was detected by the Palomar
Transient Factory. Subsequent photometric and spectroscopic monitoring has
identified a coincident broad-lined Type Ic supernova (SN), and nebular
emission detected near the explosion site is consistent with a redshift of
z=0.145. The SN-GRB exploded at an offset of ~7.6"" from the center of an
inclined r=18.1 mag red disk-dominated galaxy, and ~0.6"" from the center of a
much fainter r=23 mag object. We obtained Keck-II DEIMOS spectra of the two
objects and find a 2{\sigma} upper limit on their line-of-sight velocity offset
of ~<60 km/s. If we project the SN-GRB coordinates onto the plane of the
inclined massive disk galaxy, the explosion would have a ~61+-10 kpc offset, or
~6 times the galaxy's half-light radius. This large estimated nuclear offset
suggests that the faint source is not a star-forming region of the massive red
galaxy but is instead a dwarf galaxy. The star-formation rate of the dwarf
galaxy is ~0.05 solar masses per year, and we place an upper limit on its
oxygen abundance of 12 + log(O/H) < 8.16 dex. The identification of an LGRB in
a dwarf satellite of a massive, metal-rich primary galaxy suggests that recent
detections of LGRBs spatially coincident with metal-rich galaxies may be, in
some cases, superpositions.

electrostatically confining electrons, either in heterostructures or in
intrinsically nanoscale materials such as single molecules, nanowires, and
graphene. Recently, a new paradigm has emerged with the advent of
symmetry-protected surface states on the boundary of topological insulators,
enabling the creation of electronic systems with novel properties. For example,
time reversal symmetry (TRS) endows the massless charge carriers on the surface
of a three-dimensional topological insulator with helicity, locking the
orientation of their spin relative to their momentum. Weakly breaking this
symmetry generates a gap on the surface, resulting in charge carriers with
finite effective mass and exotic spin textures. Analogous manipulations of the
one-dimensional boundary states of a two-dimensional topological insulator are
also possible, but have yet to be observed in the leading candidate materials.
Here, we demonstrate experimentally that charge neutral monolayer graphene
displays a new type of quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect, previously thought to
exist only in TRS topological insulators, when it is subjected to a very large
magnetic field angled with respect to the graphene plane. Unlike in the TRS
case, the QSH presented here is protected by a spin-rotation symmetry that
emerges as electron spins in a half-filled Landau level are polarized by the
large in-plane magnetic field. The properties of the resulting helical edge
states can be modulated by balancing the applied field against an intrinsic
antiferromagnetic instability, which tends to spontaneously break the
spin-rotation symmetry. In the resulting canted antiferromagnetic (CAF) state,
we observe transport signatures of gapped edge states, which constitute a new
kind of one-dimensional electronic system with tunable band gap and associated
spin-texture.

high levels of variability, negative spectral indices, and (in some cases)

the fraction of non-thermal sources to increase from the younger (Class 0/I or

learning, collecting a large number of samples is often expensive in practice.
On the other hand, the model-based RL approach first estimates the transition

transfer processes in coronal plasma. We present for the first time the
observation of a kink-like oscillation of a streamer probably caused by the
streaming kinkmode Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The wave-like behavior of the
streamer was observed by Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph Experiment
(LASCO) C2 and C3 aboard SOlar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). The
observed wave had a period of about 70 to 80 minutes, and its wavelength
increased from 2 Rsun to 3 Rsun in about 1.5 hours. The phase speeds of its
crests and troughs decreased from 406 \pm 20 to 356 \pm 31kms^{-1} during the
event. Within the same heliocentric range, the wave amplitude also appeared to
increase with time. We attribute the phenomena to the MHD Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability which occur at a neutral sheet in a fluid wake. The free energy
driving the instability is supplied by the sheared flow and sheared magnetic
field across the streamer plane. The plasma properties of the local environment
of the streamer were estimated from the phase speed and instability threshold
criteria.

B2126-158 (z=3.268) from 1 to 10 GHz using the Australia Telescope Compact
Array. The source has large fractional circular polarization, m_c \equiv |V|/I,
detected at high significance across the entire band (from 15 to 90\sigma per
128 MHz sub-band). This allows us to construct the most robust circular
polarization (CP) spectrum of an AGN jet to date. We find m_c \propto
\nu^{+0.60\pm0.03} from 1.5 to 6.5 GHz, with a peak of m_c ~ 1% before the
spectrum turns over somewhere between 6.5 and 8 GHz, above which m_c \propto
\nu^{-3.0\pm0.4}. The fractional linear polarization (p) varies from <~0.2% to
~1% across our frequency range and is strongly anti-correlated with the
fractional CP, with a best-fit power law giving m_c \propto p^{-0.24\pm0.03}.
This is the first clear relation between the observed linear and circular
polarisations of an AGN jet, revealing the action of Faraday conversion of
linear polarization (LP) to CP within the jet. More detailed modelling in
conjunction with high-spatial resolution observations are required to determine
the true driving force behind the conversion (i.e. magnetic twist or internal
Faraday rotation). In particular determining whether the observed Faraday
rotation is internal or entirely external to the jet is key to this goal. The
simplest interpretation of our observations favours some internal Faraday
rotation, implying that Faraday rotation-driven conversion of LP to CP is the
dominant CP generation mechanism. In this case, a small amount of
vector-ordered magnetic field along the jet axis is required, along with
internal Faraday rotation from the low energy end of the relativistic electron
energy spectrum in an electron-proton dominated jet.

the EE student, special emphasis is devoted to subjects that are vital to the
engineering education concretely. These include, first of all, quantum
statistics, like the Fermi-Dirac distribution, as well as diffusion processes,

$\Phi(x_1,\ldots,x_k)$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ is a Boolean combination of polynomial
equations and inequalities in the $kd$ coordinates of $k$ points
$x_1,\ldots,x_k\in\mathbb{R}^d$. A sequence $P=(p_1,\ldots,p_n)$ of points in

\ldots,p_{i_k})$ holds for all choices $1\le i_1 < \cdots < i_k\le n$, or it
holds for no such choice. The Ramsey function $R_\Phi(n)$ is the smallest $N$
such that every point sequence of length $N$ contains a $\Phi$-homogeneous
subsequence of length $n$.
  Conlon, Fox, Pach, Sudakov, and Suk constructed the first examples of
semialgebraic predicates with the Ramsey function bounded from below by a tower
function of arbitrary height: for every $k\ge 4$, they exhibit a $k$-ary $\Phi$
in dimension $2^{k-4}$ with $R_\Phi$ bounded below by a tower of height $k-1$.
We reduce the dimension in their construction, obtaining a $k$-ary
semialgebraic predicate $\Phi$ on $\mathbb{R}^{k-3}$ with $R_\Phi$ bounded
below by a tower of height $k-1$.
  We also provide a natural geometric Ramsey-type theorem with a large Ramsey
function. We call a point sequence $P$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ order-type homogeneous
if all $(d+1)$-tuples in $P$ have the same orientation. Every sufficiently long
point sequence in general position in $\mathbb{R}^d$ contains an order-type
homogeneous subsequence of length $n$, and the corresponding Ramsey function
has recently been studied in several papers. Together with a recent work of
B\'ar\'any, Matou\v{s}ek, and P\'or, our results imply a tower function of
$\Omega(n)$ of height $d$ as a lower bound, matching an upper bound by Suk up
to the constant in front of $n$.

non-Newtonian and is characterised by features such as shear rate-dependent

the diffusivities reach a minimum near the quantum limit of diffusion \hbar/m

primordial black holes (PBHs) on the spectrum of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB). In the radiation dominated era, PBHs are surrounded by a
roughly homogeneous cosmic plasma which endows photons with an effective mass
through the plasma frequency. In this setting, spinning PBHs are unstable to a
spontaneous spindown through the well-known ""black-hole bomb"" mechanism. At
linear level, the photon density is trapped by the effective photon mass and
grows exponentially in time due to superradiance. As the plasma density
declines due to cosmic expansion, the associated energy around PBHs is released
and dissipated in the CMB. We evaluate the resulting spectral distortions of
the CMB in the redshift range 10^3 < z < 2x10^6. Using the existing COBE/FIRAS
bounds on CMB spectral distortions, we derive upper limits on the fraction of
dark matter that can be associated with spinning PBHs in the mass range
10^{-8}*Msun < M < 0.2*Msin. For maximally-spinning PBHs, our limits are much
tighter than those derived from microlensing or other methods. Future data from
the proposed PIXIE mission could improve our limits by several orders of
magnitude.

a growing appetite for mobile data services, heterogeneous networks have been
proposed as a cost- and energy-efficient method of improving local spectral
efficiency. Whilst unarticulated cell deployments can lead to localized

The asymptotic critical behavior of the coarse-grained polycrystalline sample

(pure) \textsl{uniaxial dipolar} ferromagnet, as is the case with
single-crystal Gd, albeit the width of the asymptotic critical region (ACR) is
reduced. As the grain size approaches $\sim \unit[30]{nm}$, the ACR is so
narrow that it could not be accessed in the present experiments. Inaccessibly
narrow ACR for $L \sim \unit[30]{nm}$ and the continuous increase in the width
of ACR as $L$ decreases from $\unit[16]{nm}$ to $\unit[9.5]{nm}$ basically
reflects a crossover to the \textsl{random uniaxial dipolar} fixed point caused

set of Stochastic Differential Equations fully equivalent to the well know
Parker Equation for the transport of Cosmic Rays. In our approach the Diffusion
tensor in the frame of the magnetic field turbolence does not depends
explicitly by Solar Latitude but varies with time using a diffusion parameter
obtained by Neutron Monitors. The parameters of the Model were tuned using data
during the solar Cycle 23 and Ulysses latitudinal Fast Scan in 1995. The actual
parametrization is able to well reproduce the observed latitudinal gradient of
protons and the southward shift of the minimum of latitudinal intensity. The
description of the model is also available online at website www.helmod.org.
The model was then applied on Pamela/Ulysses proton intensity from 2006 up to
2009. The model during this 4-year continous period agree well with both PAMELA
(at 1 AU) and Ulysses data (at various solar distance and solar latitude). The
agreement improves when considering the ratio between this data. Studies done
also with particles with different charge (e.g. electrons) allow us to explain

The degree of the check nodes is regular and the one of code-bits is Poisson

of a low complexity Belief Propagation Guided Decimation algorithm is
excellent. The algorithmic rate-distortion curve approaches the optimal curve
of the ensemble as the width of the coupling window grows. Moreover, as the

posterior measure of a binary symmetric test-channel. This measure can be
interpreted as a random Gibbs measure at a ""temperature"" directly related to
the ""noise level of the test-channel"". We investigate the links between the
algorithmic performance of the Belief Propagation Guided Decimation encoder and
the phase diagram of this Gibbs measure. The phase diagram is investigated
thanks to the cavity method of spin glass theory which predicts a number of
phase transition thresholds. In particular the dynamical and condensation
""phase transition temperatures"" (equivalently test-channel noise thresholds)
are computed. We observe that: (i) the dynamical temperature of the spatially
coupled construction saturates towards the condensation temperature; (ii) for
large degrees the condensation temperature approaches the temperature (i.e.
noise level) related to the information theoretic Shannon test-channel noise
parameter of rate-distortion theory. This provides heuristic insight into the
excellent performance of the Belief Propagation Guided Decimation algorithm.
The paper contains an introduction to the cavity method.

sections are flat and compact, with the topology of a three-torus. The
quantization is carried out along the lines that were put forward by the
authors in a previous work for spherical topology. The action of the system is
truncated at second order in perturbations. The local gauge freedom is fixed at
the classical level, although different gauges are discussed and shown to lead
to equivalent conclusions. Moreover, descriptions in terms of gauge-invariant
quantities are considered. The reduced system is proven to admit a symplectic
structure, and its dynamical evolution is dictated by a Hamiltonian constraint.
Then, the background geometry is polymerically quantized, while a Fock
representation is adopted for the inhomogeneities. The latter is selected by
uniqueness criteria adapted from quantum field theory in curved spacetimes,
which determine a specific scaling of the perturbations. In our hybrid
quantization, we promote the Hamiltonian constraint to an operator on the
kinematical Hilbert space. If the zero mode of the scalar field is interpreted
as a relational time, a suitable ansatz for the dependence of the physical
states on the polymeric degrees of freedom leads to a quantum wave equation for
the evolution of the perturbations. Alternatively, the solutions to the quantum
constraint can be characterized by their initial data on the minimum-volume
section of each superselection sector. The physical implications of this model
will be addressed in a future work, in order to check whether they are
compatible with observations.

For sets satisfying some (possible very weak) convexity conditions, this has a
long history. However, within the past 20 years Lapidus has initiated and
pioneered a systematic study of tube formulas for fractal sets. Following this,
it is natural to ask to what extend it is possible to develop a theory of
multifractal tube formulas for multifractal measures. In this paper we propose
and develop a framework for such a theory. Firstly, we define multifractal tube
formulas and, more generally, multifractal tube measures for general
multifractal measures. Secondly, we introduce and develop two approaches for
analysing these concepts for self-similar multifractal measures, namely:
  (1) Multifractal tubes of self-similar measures and renewal theory. Using
techniques from renewal theory we give a complete description of the asymptotic
behaviour of the multifractal tube formulas and tube measures of self-similar
measures satisfying the Open Set Condition.
  (2) Multifractal tubes of self-similar measures and zeta-functions.
Unfortunately, renewal theory techniques do not yield ""explicit"" expressions
for the functions describing the asymptotic behaviour of the multifractal tube
formulas and tube measures of self-similar measures. This is clearly
undesirable. For this reason, we introduce and develop a second framework for
studying multifractal tube formulas of self-similar measures. This approach is
based on multifractal zeta-functions and allow us obtain ""explicit"" expressions
for the multifractal tube formulas of self-similar measures, namely, using the
Mellin transform and the residue theorem, we are able to express the
multifractal tube formulas as sums involving the residues of the zeta-function.

entail dirty paper (DP) precoding (optimal and high complexity) or linear
precoding (suboptimal and low complexity) approaches. The system performance is
typically characterized by the sum capacity with homogenous users with perfect
channel state information at the transmitter. The sum capacity performance
analysis requires the exact probability distributions of the user
signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) or signal-to-interference plus noise ratios
(SINRs). The standard techniques from order statistics can be sufficient to
obtain the probability distributions of SNRs for DP precoding due to the
removal of known interference at the transmitter. Derivation of such
probability distributions for linear precoding techniques on the other hand is
much more challenging. For example, orthogonal beamforming techniques do not
completely cancel the interference at the user locations, thereby requiring the
analysis with SINRs. In this paper, we derive the joint probability
distributions of the user SINRs for two orthogonal beamforming methods combined
with user scheduling: adaptive orthogonal beamforming and orthogonal linear
beamforming. We obtain compact and unified solutions for the joint probability
distributions of the scheduled users' SINRs. Our analytical results can be
applied for similar algorithms and are verified by computer simulations.

tube geometry using the BOUT++ fluid modelling framework show an isolation of
the dynamics of the filament in the divertor region from the midplane region
due to three features of the magnetic geometry; the variation of magnetic
curvature along the field line, the expansion of the flux tube and strong
magnetic shear. Of the three effects, the latter two lead to a midplane
ballooning feature of the filament, whilst the former leads to a ballooning
around the X-points. In simulations containing all three effects the filament
is observed to balloon at the midplane, suggesting that the role of curvature
variation is sub-dominant to the flux expansion and magnetic shear. The
magnitudes of these effects are all strongest near the X-point which leads to
the formation of parallel density gradients. The filaments simulated, which
represent filaments in MAST, are identified as resistive ballooning, meaning
that their motion is inertially limited, not sheath limited. Parallel density
gradients can drive the filament towards a Boltzmann response when the
collisionalityof the plasma is low. The results here show that the formation of
parallel density gradients is a natural and inevitable consequence of a
realistic magnetic geometry and therefore the transition to the Boltzmann
response is a consequence of the use of realistic magnetic geometry. The
Boltzmann response causes the filament to self-organise and spin on an axis.
The transition from interchange motion to the Boltzmann response occurs with
increasing temperature through a decrease in collisionality. This is confirmed
by measuring the correlation between density and potential perturbations within
the filament, which is low in the anti-symmetric state associated with the
interchange mechanism, but high in the Boltzmann regime.

density scaling which has been observed in many molecular and polymeric glass

(relaxation times and transport coefficients being functions of
$\rho^{\gamma_S}/T$, where $\rho$ is density, $T$ is temperature, and
$\gamma_S$ is a material specific scaling exponent) is an approximation to a
more general scaling predicted by the isomorph theory. Furthermore, the
isomorph theory provides an explanation for Rosenfeld scaling (relaxation times
and transport coefficients being functions of excess entropy) which has been
observed in simulations of both molecular and polymeric systems. Doing
molecular dynamics simulations of flexible Lennard-Jones chains (LJC) with
rigid bonds, we here provide the first detailed test of the isomorph theory
applied to flexible chain molecules. We confirm the existence of isomorphs,
which are curves in the phase diagram along which the dynamics is invariant in
the appropriate reduced units. This holds not only for the relaxation times but
also for the full time dependence of the dynamics, including chain specific
dynamics such as the end-to-end vector autocorrelation function and the
relaxation of the Rouse modes. As predicted by the isomorph theory, jumps
between different state points on the same isomorph happen instantaneously
without any slow relaxation. Since the LJC is a simple coarse-grained model for
alkanes and polymers, our results provide a possible explanation for why
power-law density scaling is observed experimentally in alkanes and many
polymeric systems. The theory provides an independent method of determining the
scaling exponent, which is usually treated as a empirical scaling parameter.

relies on a recent dynamic extension of the Peierls-Nabarro equation, so as to
account for core-width generalized stacking-fault energy effects. The degrees
of freedom of the solution of the latter equation are reduced by means of the
collective-variable method, well known in soliton theory, which we reformulate
in a way suitable to the problem at hand. Through these means, two coupled
governing equations for the dislocation position and core width are obtained,
which are combined into one single complex-valued equation of motion, of
compact form. The latter equation embodies the history dependence of
dislocation inertia. It is employed to investigate the motion of an edge
dislocation under uniform time-dependent loading, with focus on the
subsonic/transonic transition. Except in the steady-state supersonic range of
velocities---which the equation does not address---our results are in good
agreement with atomistic simulations on tungsten. In particular, we provide an
explanation for the transition, showing that it is governed by a
loading-dependent dynamic critical stress. The transition has the character of
a delayed bifurcation. Moreover, various quantitative predictions are made,
that could be tested in atomistic simulations. Overall, this work demonstrates
the crucial role played by core-width variations in dynamic dislocation motion.

maturity with the publication of a Technical Design Report, and there is a
strong interest in Japan to host such a machine. We summarize key aspects of
the Beyond the Standard Model physics case for the ILC in this contribution to
the US High Energy Physics strategy process. On top of the strong guaranteed
physics case in the detailed exploration of the recently discovered Higgs
boson, the top quark and electroweak precision measurements, the ILC will offer
unique opportunities which are complementary to the LHC program of the next
decade. Many of these opportunities have connections to the Cosmic and
Intensity Frontiers, which we comment on in detail. We illustrate the general
picture with examples of how our world could turn out to be and what the ILC
would contribute in these cases, with an emphasis on value-added beyond the
LHC. These comprise examples from Supersymmetry including light Higgsinos, a
comprehensive bottom-up coverage of NLSP-LSP combinations for slepton, squark,
chargino and neutralino NLSP, a stau-coannihilation dark matter scenario and
bilinear R-parity violation as explanation for neutrino masses and mixing, as
well as generic WIMP searches and Little Higgs models as non-SUSY examples.

studied in accreting stellar-mass black holes. These observations are performed
in order to understand how mass accretion rates and jetted outflows are linked
in these individual systems. Such contemporaneous studies in supermassive black
holes (SMBH) are harder to perform, as viscous times scale linearly with mass.
However, as NGC 4395 is the lowest known mass Seyfert galaxy, we have used it
to examine the simultaneous X-ray (Swift) and radio (VLA) correlation in a SMBH
in a reasonably timed observing campaign. We find that the intrinsic X-ray
variability is stronger than the radio variability, and that the fluxes are
only weakly or tentatively coupled, similar to prior results obtained in NGC
4051. If the corona and the base of the jet are one and the same, this may
suggest that the corona in radio-quiet AGN filters disk variations, only
transferring the strongest and/or most sustained variations into the jet.
Further, when both NGC 4395 and NGC 4051 are placed on the stellar-mass L_X-L_R
plane, they appear to reside on the steeper L_X-L_R track. This suggests that
SMBHs also follow two distinct tracks just as stellar-mass black holes do, and
supports the idea that the same physical disk-jet mechanisms are at play across
the mass scale.

structure of a Leavitt path algebra with the aim of giving a description of the
center. Extreme cycles appear for the first time; they concentrate the purely
infinite part of a Leavitt path algebra and, jointly with the line points and
vertices in cycles without exits, are the key ingredients in order to determine
the center of a Leavitt path algebra. Our work will rely on our previous
approach to the center of a prime Leavitt path algebra \cite{CMMSS1}. We will
go further into the structure itself of the Leavitt path algebra. For example,
the ideal $I(P_{ec} \cup P_{c} \cup P_l)$ generated by vertices in extreme
cycles ($P_{ec}$), by vertices in cycles without exits ($P_c$) and by line
points ($P_l$) will be a dense ideal in some cases, for instance in the finite
one or, more generally, if every vertex connects to $P_l \cup P_c\cup P_{ec}$.
Hence its structure will contain much of the information about the Leavitt path
algebra. In the row-finite case, we will need to add a new hereditary set: the
set of vertices whose tree has infinite bifurcations ($P_{b^\infty}$).

a sample of 39 active galactic nuclei (AGN) with black hole masses estimated
from reverberation mapping or dynamical modeling. We obtained new Swift
observations of PG 1426+015, which has the largest estimated black hole mass of
the AGN in our sample. We develop a novel statistical method to estimate the
PSD from a lightcurve of photon counts with arbitrary sampling, eliminating the
need to bin a lightcurve to achieve Gaussian statistics, and we use this
technique to estimate the X-ray variability parameters for the faint AGN in our
sample. We find that the normalization of the high-frequency X-ray PSD is
inversely proportional to black hole mass. We discuss how to use this scaling
relationship to obtain black hole mass estimates from the short time-scale
X-ray variability amplitude with precision ~ 0.38 dex. The amplitude of optical
variability on time scales of days is also anti-correlated with black hole
mass, but with larger scatter. Instead, the optical variability amplitude
exhibits the strongest anti-correlation with luminosity. We conclude with a
discussion of the implications of our results for estimating black hole mass
from the amplitude of AGN variability.

After presenting the classical and quantum formalism, we analyze the spectrum
of the theory using perturbation theory to one-loop and using Monte Carlo
techniques on the lattice. In perturbation theory, results to all orders depend
on the combination x=\lambda NL and an angle defined in terms of the magnetic
flux (\lambda\ is 't Hooft coupling). Thus, fixing the angle, the system
exhibits a form of volume independence (NL dependence). The numerical results
interpolate between our perturbative calculations and the confinement regime.
They are consistent with x-scaling and provide interesting information about
the k-string spectrum and effective string theories. The occurrence of
tachyonic instabilities is also analysed. They seem to be avoidable in the
large N limit with a suitable scaling of the magnetic flux.

solutions for the orbits of Local Group galaxies under the cosmological

particles initially near and moving with the Large Magellanic Cloud in these
solutions end up with distributions in angular position and redshift similar to
the Magellanic Stream, though with the usual overly prominent leading component
that the Milky Way corona might have suppressed. Another possible example of
the effect of conditions at high redshift is a model primeval stream around the
Local Group galaxy NGC 6822. Depending on the solution for Local Group dynamics
this primeval stream can end up with position angle similar to the HI around
this galaxy, and a redshift gradient in the observed direction. The gradient is
much smaller than observed, but might have been increased by dissipative
contraction. Presented also is an even more speculative illustration of the

centre Coulomb problem formulated in the Jacobi coordinates of the entrance
channel. This approach provides the asymptotically correct description of this
channel: the correct dissociation limit is obtained, there are no spurious
long-range interactions, the polarization attraction appears naturally, the
electron screening can be easily taken into account. The defects of the
description are removed into the muon transfer channel in which their effect is
not expected to be too significant because of large kinetic energies there. The
previous calculations carried out in this way allowed one to explain
experimentally observed features of the temperature dependence of the transfer
rate in hydrogen-neon mixtures. In the present work, a more perfect algorithm

front-end analysis and pattern recognition. The front end analysis involves
preprocessing and feature extraction. The traditional voice activity detection
algorithms which track only energy cannot successfully identify potential
speech from input because the unwanted part of the speech also has some energy
and appears to be speech. In the proposed system, VAD that calculates energy of
high frequency part separately as zero crossing rate to differentiate noise
from speech is used. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) is used as
feature extraction method and Generalized Regression Neural Network is used as
recognizer. MFCC provides low word error rate and better feature extraction.
Neural Network improves the accuracy. Thus a small database containing all
possible syllable pronunciation of the user is sufficient to give recognition
accuracy closer to 100%. Thus the proposed technique entertains realization of
real time speaker independent applications like mobile phones, PDAs etc.

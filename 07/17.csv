system in the vicinity of the saddle-node bifurcation associated with the loss
of global stability such as voltage collapse or phase angle instability.
Fluctuations of the system state vector are driven by random variations of
loads and intermittent renewable generation. In the vicinity of collapse the
power system experiences so-called phenomenon of critical slowing-down
characterized by slowing and simultaneous amplification of the system state
vector fluctuations. In generic case of a co-dimension 1 bifurcation
corresponding to the threshold of instability it is possible to extract a
single mode of the system state vector responsible for this phenomenon. We
characterize stochastic fluctuations of the system state vector using the
formal perturbative expansion over the lowest (real) eigenvalue of the system
power flow Jacobian and verify the resulting expressions for correlation
functions of the state vector by direct numerical simulations. We conclude that
the onset of critical slowing-down is a good marker of approach to the
threshold of global instability. It can be straightforwardly detected from the
analysis of single-node autostructure and autocorrelation functions of system
state variables and thus does not require full observability of the grid.

include the ability to form dense, nanocrystalline films up to hundreds of

Continued deposition forms the thick compacted film. Deposition from an
aerosolized mixture of ZnS and diamond powders onto all targets results in
linear trend from apparent sputter erosion of the substrate at 100% diamond to
formation of a film with increasing fractions of ZnS. The crossover from
abrasion to film formation on sapphire occurs above about 50% ZnS and a mixture
of 90% ZnS and 10% diamond forms a well-adhered film of about 0.7 \mu m
thickness at a rate of 0.14 \mu m/min. Resulting films are characterized by
scanning electron microscopy, profilometry, infrared transmission spectroscopy,

yearly ""Secret Santa"" event. With the approach of Christmas, all the students
place their names in a hat; each student, in turn, draws a name out of the hat,
thus becoming Secret Santa to the student whose name is drawn. On the day
before Christmas break, each student places a gift in front of the locker of
the student to whom she or he is Secret Santa.
  Unfortunately, children being children, some students might forget to bring
gifts on this day. Students who do not find gifts next to their lockers,
feeling cheated, angrily take their gifts back from their recipients, who in
turn reclaim their gifts from their recipients, and so forth.
  We analyze the distribution of the number $L$ of students whose Christmas is
ruined, as a function of the number of students who do not bring gifts. We give
a simple, explicit formula for the probability of every possible value for $L$
(backed by three proofs of distinct flavors), as well as closed-form formulae
for its expectation and variance. Notably, we show that if $m$ kids forget to
bring gifts, then the expected fraction of kids whose Christmas is not ruined
is less than $\frac{1}{m+1}$ (regardless of the total number of students), with
low probability for a large deviation from this fraction.
  The underlying theoretical results are applicable to the study of
manipulation in matching markets within game theory.

proliferated in recent years, with examples ranging from spontaneous brain

how and why interacting living systems could dynamically tune themselves to be
poised in the vicinity of a critical point is lacking. Here we employ tools
from statistical mechanics and information theory to show that complex adaptive
or evolutionary systems can be much more efficient in coping with diverse
heterogeneous environmental conditions when operating at criticality.
Analytical as well as computational evolutionary and adaptive models vividly
illustrate that a community of such systems dynamically self-tunes close to a
critical state as the complexity of the environment increases while they remain
non-critical for simple and predictable environments. A more robust convergence
to criticality emerges in co-evolutionary and co-adaptive set-ups in which
individuals aim to represent other agents in the community with fidelity,
thereby creating a collective critical ensemble and providing the best possible
trade-off between accuracy and flexibility. Our approach provides a
parsimonious and general mechanism for the emergence of critical-like behavior
in living systems needing to cope with complex environments or trying to
efficiently coordinate themselves as an ensemble.

and new vortices are induced, commonly appearing in oppositely charged pairs.
We demonstrate that not only the form and the topological charge of the

formation and evolution of vortices. We formulate common rules for finding the
number of induced vortices and the corresponding rotation directions, stemming
from the initial conditions of various incident beams, as well as from the
dynamical aspects of their propagation. The net topological charge of the
vortex is conserved during propagation, as it should be, but the total number
of charges is not necessarily same as the initial number, because of the
complex nature of the system. When the EIT condition is lifted, an enhancement
region of beam dynamics if reached, in which the dynamics and the expansion of
the beam greatly accelerate. In the end, we discuss the liquid like behavior of

controllable by means of local decentralized control. Recent research efforts

here we employ the recently-introduced paradigm of sparsity- promoting optimal

regularize the standard quadratic performance index with an l1-penalty on the

slow coherency theory and are aimed at imitating homogeneous networks without
inter-area oscillations. We use the New England power grid model to demonstrate
that the proposed combination of the sparsity-promoting control design with the
slow coherency objectives performs almost as well as the optimal centralized
control while only making use of a single wide-area communication link. In

Euler angles. Applying our method, we highlight the role of the real-space

simulate STM images at constant-current condition, and find that their quality
depends very much on the tip orientation. Some orientations result in
protrusions on the images that do not occur above W atoms. The presence of such
apparent atom positions makes it difficult to identify the exact position of
surface atoms. It is suggested that this tip orientation effect should be
considered at the evaluation of experimental STM images on other surfaces as

multi-qubit register against decoherence-induced errors, but their
implementation is an outstanding challenge for the development of large-scale
quantum computers. A first step is to stabilize a non-equilibrium state of a
simple quantum system such as a qubit or a cavity mode in the presence of
decoherence. Several groups have recently accomplished this goal using
measurement-based feedback schemes. A next step is to prepare and stabilize a
state of a composite system. Here we demonstrate the stabilization of an
entangled Bell state of a quantum register of two superconducting qubits for an
arbitrary time. Our result is achieved by an autonomous feedback scheme which
combines continuous drives along with a specifically engineered coupling
between the two-qubit register and a dissipative reservoir. Similar autonomous
feedback techniques have recently been used for qubit reset and the
stabilization of a single qubit state, as well as for creating and stabilizing
states of multipartite quantum systems. Unlike conventional, measurement-based
schemes, an autonomous approach counter-intuitively uses engineered dissipation
to fight decoherence, obviating the need for a complicated external feedback
loop to correct errors, simplifying implementation. Instead the feedback loop
is built into the Hamiltonian such that the steady state of the system in the
presence of drives and dissipation is a Bell state, an essential building-block
state for quantum information processing. Such autonomous schemes, broadly
applicable to a variety of physical systems as demonstrated by a concurrent
publication with trapped ion qubits, will be an essential tool for the
implementation of quantum-error correction.

parameter $n$ is large. Our results show, under some light conditions on the
coefficients
  $c_i$ and the tails of $\xi_i, \tilde \xi_i$, that the correlation functions
of the zeroes of $f$ and $\tilde f$ are approximately the same. As an
application, we give some answers to the classical question `""How many zeroes
of a random polynomials are real?"" for several classes of random polynomial
models.
  Our analysis relies on a general replacement principle, motivated by some
recent work in random matrix theory. This principle enables one to compare the
correlation functions of two random functions $f$ and $\tilde f$ if their log
magnitudes $\log |f|, \log|\tilde f|$ are close in distribution, and if some
non-concentration bounds are obeyed.

while undergoing linear motion with uniform acceleration in a Minkowski vacuum.
This thermality can be demonstrated by tracing the vacuum state of the field
over the modes beyond the accelerated detector's event horizon. However, the
event horizon is well-defined only if the detector moves with eternal uniform
linear acceleration. This idealized condition cannot be fulfilled in realistic
situations when the motion unavoidably involves periods of non-uniform
acceleration. Many experimental proposals to test the Unruh effect are of this
nature. Often circular or oscillatory motion, which lacks an obvious geometric
description, is considered in such proposals. The proper perspective for
theoretically going beyond, or experimentally testing, the Unruh-Hawking effect
in these more general conditions has to be offered by concepts and techniques
in non-equilibrium quantum field theory. In this paper we provide a detailed
analysis of how an Unruh-DeWitt detector undergoing oscillatory motion responds
to the fluctuations of a quantum field. Numerical results for the late-time
temperatures of the oscillating detector are presented. We comment on the
digressions of these results from what one would obtain from a naive

on circumstellar disk evolution. Disks residing in young clusters can be
exposed to extreme levels of FUV flux from nearby OB stars, and observations
show that disks in such environments are being actively photoevaporated.
Typical FUV flux levels can be factors of \sim 10^{2} - 10^{4} higher than the
interstellar value. These fields are effective in driving mass loss from
circumstellar disks because they act at large radial distance from the host
star, i.e., where most of the disk mass is located, and where the gravitational
potential well is shallow. We combine viscous evolution (an \alpha-disk model)
with an existing FUV photoevaporation model to derive constraints on disk
lifetimes, and to determine disk properties as functions of time, including
mass loss rates, disk masses, and radii. We also consider the effects of X-ray
photoevaporation from the host star using an existing model, and show that for
disks around solar-mass stars, externally-generated FUV fields are often the
dominant mechanism in depleting disk material. For sufficiently large
viscosities, FUV fields can efficiently photoevaporate disks over the entire
range of parameter space. Disks with viscosity parameter \alpha = 10^{-3} are
effectively dispersed within 1-3 Myr; for higher viscosities (\alpha = 10^{-2})
disks are dispersed within \sim 0.25 - 0.5 Myr. Furthermore, disk radii are
truncated to less than \sim100 AU, which can possibly affect the formation of
planets. Our model predictions are consistent with the range of observed masses
and radii of proplyds in the Orion Nebula Cluster.

other interior matter models are commonly used in the construction of lumpy

especially those of the Active Regions (ARs), have been studied using the
line-of-sight data from magnetograms taken by SOHO and several other
instruments (see e.g. Abramenko et al (2002, 2003),Abramenko and Yurchyshyn
(2010)). This includes structure functions and their exponents, flatness curves
and correlation functions. In these works, the dependence of structure function
exponents ($\zeta_p$) of the order of the structure functions ($\it{p}$) was
modeled using a non-intermittent K41 model. It is now well known that the ARs
are highly turbulent and are associated with strong intermittent events. In
this paper we compare some of the observations from Abramenko et al (2003) with
the log-Poisson model (Biskamp 2003) used for modeling intermittent MHD
turbulent flows. Next, we analyze the structure function data obtained from the
direct numerical simulations (DNS) of homogeneous, incompressible 3D-MHD
turbulence in three cases: sustained by forcing, freely decaying and a flow
initially driven and later allowed to decay (case 3). The respective DNS
replicate the properties seen in the plots of $\zeta_p$ against $\it{p}$ of
ARs. We also reproduce the trends and changes observed in intermittency in
flatness [Abramenko and Yurchyshyn (2010)] and correlation functions [Abramenko
et al (2003)] of ARs. It is suggested from this analysis that an AR in the
onset phase of a flare can be treated as a forced 3D-MHD turbulent system in
its simplest form and that the flaring stage is representative of decaying
3D-MHD turbulence. It is also inferred that significant changes in
intermittency from the initial onset phase of a flare to its final peak flaring
phase, are related to the time taken by the system to reach the initial onset
phase.

serve a large number of users at high rates. However, the receiver processing
in the uplink relies on channel estimates which are known to suffer from pilot
interference. In this work, making use of the similarity of the uplink received
signal in CDMA with that of a multi-cell multi-antenna system, we perform a
large system analysis when the receiver employs an MMSE filter with a pilot
contaminated estimate. We assume a Rayleigh fading channel with different
received powers from users. We find the asymptotic Signal to Interference plus
Noise Ratio (SINR) as the number of antennas and number of users per base
station grow large while maintaining a fixed ratio. Through the SINR expression
we explore the scenario where the number of users being served are comparable
to the number of antennas at the base station. The SINR explicitly captures the
effect of pilot contamination and is found to be the same as that employing a
matched filter with a pilot contaminated estimate. We also find the exact
expression for the interference suppression obtained using an MMSE filter which
is an important factor when there are significant number of users in the system
as compared to the number of antennas. In a typical set up, in terms of the
five percentile SINR, the MMSE filter is shown to provide significant gains
over matched filtering and is within 5 dB of MMSE filter with perfect channel
estimate. Simulation results for achievable rates are close to large system
limits for even a 10-antenna base station with 3 or more users per cell.

(QPO) and its harmonic during the rising phase of an outburst in the black-hole
binary XTE J1550-564. We compare these frequency resolved spectra to the
time-averaged spectrum and the spectrum of the rapid (<0.1s) variability. The
spectrum of the time averaged emission can be described by a disc, a Compton
upscattered tail, and its reflection. The QPO spectrum contains no detectable
disc, and the Compton spectrum is generally harder than in the time averaged
emission, and shows less reflection, making it very similar to the spectrum of
the rapid variability. The harmonic likewise contains no detectable disc
component, but has a Compton spectrum which is systematically softer than the
QPO, softer even than the Compton tail in the time averaged emission. We
interpret these results in the context of the Lense-Thirring model for the QPO,
where a precessing hot flow replaces the inner disc, and the harmonic is
produced by the angular dependence of Compton scattering within the hot flow.
We extend these models to include stratification of the hot flow, so that it is
softer (lower optical depth) at larger radii closer to the truncated disc, and
harder (higher optical depth) in the innermost parts of the flow where the
rapid variability is produced. The different optical depth with radius gives
rise to different angular dependence of the Comptonised emission, weighting the
fundamental to the inner parts of the hot flow, and the harmonic to the outer.
This is the first model which can explain both the spectrum of the QPO and its
harmonic in a self consistent geometry.

and ions, we study the effects of turbulence and conduction in the hot
intracluster medium. We show how the power spectrum of the gas density
perturbations can accurately constrain both processes. The characteristic
amplitude of density perturbations is linearly related to the strength of
turbulence, i.e. the 3D Mach number, as A(k)_max = 0.25 M. The slope of A(k) in
turn reflects the level of conduction. In a non-conductive medium, subsonic
stirring motions advect density with a similar nearly Kolmogorov cascade.
Increasing conduction (via magnetic suppression f = 0.001-1) progressively
steepens the spectrum towards the Burgers-like regime. The turbulent Prandtl
number defines the dynamic similarity of the flow; at scales where Pt < 100,
the spectrum develops a significant decay. The transition is gentle for highly
suppressed conduction, f < 0.001, while sharp in the opposite regime. For
strong conductivity (f > 0.1), Pt ~ 100 occurs on spatial scales larger than
the injection scale. The velocity spectrum is instead not much affected by
conduction. The f > 0.1 regime affects the appearance of X-ray images, in which
Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor rolls and filaments are washed out. In a
stratified system, weak/strong turbulence induces higher isobaric/adiabatic
fluctuations, while conduction forces both modes towards the intermediate
isothermal regime. We provide a general analytic fit which is applied to new
deep Chandra observations of Coma. The observed spectrum is best consistent
with strongly suppressed effective isotropic conduction, f = 0.001, and mild
subsonic turbulence, M = 0.45 (with injection at ~250 kpc). The low
conductivity corroborates the survival of sharp features in the ICM (cold
fronts, filaments, bubbles), and indicates that cooling flows may not be
balanced by conduction.

phenomenological approach, since it is difficult to imagine a connection with
inflation. We find that in the NDI and NVI cases larger isocurvature fractions
are allowed than in the corresponding models with CDI. For uncorrelated
perturbations, the upper limit to the primordial NDI (NVI) fraction is 24%
(20%) at k = 0.002 Mpc^{-1} and 28% (16%) at k = 0.01 Mpc^{-1}. For maximally
correlated (anticorrelated) perturbations, the upper limit to the NDI fraction
is 3.0% (0.9%). The nonadiabatic contribution to the CMB temperature variance
can be as large as 10% (-13%) for the NDI (NVI) modes. Bayesian model
comparison favors pure adiabatic initial mode over the mixed primordial
adiabatic and NDI, NVI, or CDI perturbations. At best, the betting odds for a
mixed model (uncorrelated NDI) are 1:3.4 compared to the pure adiabatic model.
For the phenomenological generally correlated mixed models the odds are about
1:100, whereas the slow-roll approach leads to 1:13 (NDI) and 1:51 (CDI).

fluctuation in halo number adds a significant co-variant scatter in the
observed amplitudes of weak lensing power spectrum at nonlinear, small scales

paper, we show that by measuring both the number counts of clusters and the
power spectrum in the same survey region, we can mitigate this loss of

  First, using the halo model approach, we derive the cross-correlation between
the halo number counts and the weak lensing power spectrum, taking into account
the super-sample covariance effect, which well matches the distributions
measured from 1000 realizations for a Lambda-dominated cold dark matter model.
Then we show that adding the observed number counts of massive halos with M>
10^14 Ms/h can significantly improve the information content of weak lensing
power spectrum, almost recovering the Gaussian information up to lmax~1000, if
the average mass profiles of the massive halos are known, which can be
estimated from stacked lensing. When combined with the halo number counts for M
> 3 or 1 x 10^14 Ms/h, the improvement is up to a factor of 1.4 or 2 at
lmax~1000 --2000, equivalent to a factor 2 or 4 times larger survey volume,

set strong constraints on wino dark matter. By combining results from Fermi-LAT
and HESS, we show that: light nonthermal wino dark matter is strongly excluded;
thermal wino dark matter is allowed only if the Milky Way dark matter
distribution has a significant (>~0.4 kpc) core; and for plausible NFW and
Einasto distributions the entire range of wino masses from 100 GeV up to 3 TeV
can be excluded. The case of light, nonthermal wino dark matter is particularly
interesting in scenarios with decaying moduli that reheat the universe to a low
temperature. Typically such models have been discussed for low reheating
temperatures, not far above the BBN bound of a few MeV. We show that
constraints on the allowed wino relic density push such models to higher
reheating temperatures and hence heavier moduli. Even for a flattened halo
model consisting of an NFW profile with constant-density core inside 1 kpc and
a density near the sun of 0.3 GeV/cm^3, for 150 GeV winos current data
constrains the reheat temperature to be above 1.4 GeV. As a result, for models
in which the wino mass is a loop factor below the gravitino mass, the data
favor moduli that are more than an order of magnitude heavier than the
gravitino. We discuss some of the sobering implications of this result for the
status of supersymmetry. We also comment on other neutralino dark matter
scenarios, in particular the case of mixed bino/higgsino dark matter. We show
that in this case, direct and indirect searches are complementary to each other

of the GeV emission observed to last for minutes to hours following other very
bright GRBs. A tenuous, wind-stratified circumburst density profile is required
by the observations, suggesting a massive-star progenitor with a low mass-loss

red galaxies increases with the environmental overdensity and with the stellar
mass, consistent with previous works. As at lower redshift, the red fraction
appears to be separable in mass and environment, suggesting the action of two
processes: mass and environmental quenching. The parameters describing these
appear to be essentially the same at z~0.7 as locally. We explore the relation
between red fraction, mass and environment also for the central and satellite
galaxies separately, paying close attention to the effects of impurities in the
central-satellite classification and using carefully constructed samples
matched in stellar mass. There is little evidence for a dependence of the red
fraction of centrals on overdensity. Satellites are consistently redder at all
overdensities, and the satellite quenching efficiency increases with
overdensity at 0.1<z<0.4. This is less marked at higher redshift, but both are
nevertheless consistent with the equivalent local measurements. At a given
stellar mass, the fraction of galaxies that are satellites also increases with
the overdensity. At a given overdensity and mass, the obtained relation between
the environmental quenching and the satellite fraction agrees well with the
satellite quenching efficiency, demonstrating that the environmental quenching
in the overall population is consistent with being entirely produced through
the satellite quenching process at least up to z=0.7. However, despite the
unprecedented size of our high redshift samples, the associated statistical
uncertainties are still significant and our statements should be understood as
approximations to physical reality, rather than physically exact formulae.

originated from Read and Green's observation that the Moore-Read quantum Hall
state and a (relatively simple) two-dimensional p+ip superconductor both
support so-called Ising non-Abelian anyons. Here we establish a similar
correspondence between the Z_3 Read-Rezayi quantum Hall state and a novel
two-dimensional superconductor in which charge-2e Cooper pairs are built from
fractionalized quasiparticles. In particular, both phases harbor Fibonacci
anyons that---unlike Ising anyons---allow for universal topological quantum
computation solely through braiding. Using a variant of Teo and Kane's
construction of non-Abelian phases from weakly coupled chains, we provide a
blueprint for such a superconductor using Abelian quantum Hall states
interlaced with an array of superconducting islands. Fibonacci anyons appear as
neutral deconfined particles that lead to a two-fold ground-state degeneracy on
a torus. In contrast to a p+ip superconductor, vortices do not yield additional
particle types yet depending on non-universal energetics can serve as a trap
for Fibonacci anyons. These results imply that one can, in principle, combine
well-understood and widely available phases of matter to realize non-Abelian
anyons with universal braid statistics. Numerous future directions are
discussed, including speculations on alternative realizations with fewer
experimental requirements.

K and r limited galaxy redshift distributions and number counts to map the

homogeneous models in three large regions of the high latitude sky, we find
evidence for under-densities ranging from ~4-40% in these regions to depths of
~150h-1Mpc with the deepest under-density being over the Southern Galactic cap.
Using the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey we then establish the

use redshift catalogues to map peculiar velocities over the same areas using

accounting for the direct effect of large-scale structure on zbar(m) we can
then search for peculiar velocities. Taking all three regions into

system of interest to an environment, or bath, held at thermal equilibrium.
Realistic bath models are at least as challenging to construct as models for
the quantum systems themselves, since they must incorporate many degrees of
freedom that interact with the system on a wide range of timescales. Owing to
computational limitations, the environment is often modeled with simple
functional forms, with a few parameters fit to experiment to yield
semi-quantitative results. Growing computational resources have enabled the
construction of more realistic bath models from molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations. In this paper, we develop a numerical technique to construct these
atomistic bath models with better accuracy and decreased cost. We apply a novel
signal processing technique, known as super-resolution, combined with a
dictionary of physically-motivated bath modes to derive spectral densities from
MD simulations. Our approach reduces the required simulation time and provides
a more accurate spectral density than can be obtained via standard Fourier
transform methods. Moreover, the spectral density is provided as a convenient
closed-form expression which yields an analytic time-dependent bath kernel.
Exciton dynamics of the Fenna-Matthews-Olsen light-harvesting complex are
simulated with a second order time-convolutionless master equation, and
spectral densities constructed via super-resolution are shown to reproduce the
dynamics using only a quarter of the amount of MD data.

Full field solutions are obtained for three dimensional material
microstructures characterized by ran- dom distributions of void nucleating
particles. Crack growth resistance curves and fracture surface roughness
statistics are calculated using standard procedures. The range of void
nucleating particle volume fractions considered give rise to values of
toughness, JIC, that vary by a factor of four. For all volume fractions
considered, the computed fracture surfaces are self-affine over a size range of
about two orders of magnitude with a roughness exponent of 0.54 $\pm$ 0.03. For
small void nucleating particle volume fractions, the mean large particle
spacing serves as a single dominant length scale. In this regime, the
correlation length of the fracture surface corresponding to the cut-off of the
self-affine behavior is found to be linearly related to JIC thus quantitatively
correlating toughness and fracture surface roughness.

detonation waves are undercompressive and the stability of these waves is
delicate and has not been treated by standard weighted-norm techniques. The

Controllability of a dynamical system is the ability to choose certain inputs

characteristic energy-containing length $\lambda_{\bot}$ of the squared

mean magnetic field inside a coronal hole (CH) at the base of the corona. The
characteristic length scale defines directly the heating rate. We use a time
series analysis of solar granulation and magnetic field measurements inside two

A data set for transverse magnetic fields obtained with the Solar Optical
Telescope/Spectro-Polarimeter (SOT/SP) aboard {\it Hinode} spacecraft was
utilized to analyze the squared transverse magnetic field fluctuations $b_t^2$.
Local correlation tracking (LCT) was applied to derive the squared transverse
velocity fluctuations $u^2$. We find that for $u^2$-structures, Batchelor
integral scale $\lambda$ varies in a range of 1800 - 2100 km, whereas the
correlation length $\varsigma$ and the $e$-folding length $L$ vary between 660
and 1460 km. Structures for $b_t^2$ yield $\lambda \approx 1600$ km, $\varsigma
\approx 640$ km, and $L \approx 620$ km. An averaged (over $\lambda,
\varsigma$, and $L$) value of the characteristic length of $u^2$-fluctuations
is 1260$\pm$500 km, and that of $b_t^2$ is 950$\pm$560 km. The characteristic
length scale in the photosphere is approximately 1.5-50 times smaller than that
adopted in previous models (3-30$\times10^3$ km). Our results provide a
critical input parameter for current models of coronal heating and should yield
an improved understanding of fast solar wind acceleration.

atmosphere is in hydrostatic balance, as well as thermal and photoionization
equilibrium. Collisional and radiative transitions are included in the
determination of the n=2 state level population. We find that H\alpha\
absorption is dominated by an optical depth \tau\ ~ 1 shell, composed of
hydrogen in the metastable 2s state that is located below the hydrogen
ionization layer. The number density of the 2s state within the shell is found
to vary slowly with radius, while that of the 1s state falls rapidly. Thus
while the Ly\alpha absorption, for a certain wavelength, occurs inside a
relatively well defined impact parameter, the contribution to H\alpha\
absorption is roughly uniform over the entire atomic hydrogen layer. The model
can approximately reproduce the observed Ly\alpha\ and H\alpha\ integrated
transit depths for HD189733b by using an ionization rate enhanced over that
expected for the star by an order of magnitude. For HD 209458b, we are unable
to explain the asymmetric H\alpha\ line profile observed by Jensen et al., as
the model produces a symmetric line profile with transit depth comparable to
that of HD 189733b. In an appendix, we study the effect of the stellar

The sample contains 99 DLAs towards 89 quasars selected from the SDSS DR5 DLA
sample in a uniform way. We analyze the metallicities and kinematic
diagnostics, including the velocity width of 90% of the optical depth, \Delta
v_{90}, and the equivalent widths of the SiII 1526, CIV 1548 and MgII 2796
transitions. To avoid strong line-saturation effects on the metallicities
measured in medium-resolution spectra (FWHM~71 km/s), we derived metallicities
from metal transitions which absorbed at most 35% of the quasar continuum flux.
We find the evolution in cosmic mean metallicity of the sample, <Z> = (-0.04 +-
0.013)z -(1.06 +- 0.36), consistent with no evolution over the redshift range z
~ [2.2, 4.4], but note that the majority of our sample falls at z ~ [2.2, 3.5].
The apparent lack of metallicity evolution with redshift is also seen in a lack
of evolution in the median \Delta v_{90} and SiII 1526 equivalent width values.
While this result may seem to conflict with other large surveys that have
detected significant metallicity evolution, such as Rafelski et al. 2012 who
found <Z> = (-0.22 +- 0.03)z - (0.65 +- 0.09) over z ~ [0, 5], several tests
show that these surveys are not inconsistent with our new result. However, over
the smaller redshift range covered by our uniformly-selected sample, the true
evolution of the cosmic mean metallicity in DLAs may be somewhat flatter than
the Rafelski et al. 2012 estimate.

Analysis (ICA) in conjunction with either maximum likelihood (ML) or Support
Vector Machines (SVM) is proposed for MIMO-OFDM signals over frequency
selective, time varying channels. The method is blind in the sense that it is
assumed that the receiver has no information about the channel and transmitted
signals other than that the spatial streams of signals are statistically
independent. The processing consists of separation of the MIMO streams followed
by modulation classification of the separated signals. While in general, blind
separation of signals over frequency selective channels is a difficult problem,
the non-frequency selective nature of the channel experienced by individual
symbols in a MIMO-OFDM system enables the application of well-known ICA
algorithms. Modulation classification is implemented by maximum likelihood and
by an SVM-based modulation classification method relying on pre-selected
modulation-dependent features. To improve performance in time varying channels,
the invariance of the channel is exploited across the coherence bandwidth and
the time coherence. The proposed method is shown to perform with high
probability of correct classification over realistic ITU pedestrian and
vehicular channels. An upper bound on the probability of correct classification
is developed based on the Cramer Rao bound of channel estimation.

dot-to-dot variation in physical dimensions, this spread is contributed to by
variations in the structure of the quantum dot interface, which controls the
shape of the confinement potential. Here we directly evaluate the effect of the
composition of the core-shell interface on single- and multi-exciton dynamics
via side-by-side measurements of individual core-shell CdSe-CdS nanocrystals
with a sharp vs. smooth (graded) interface. To realize the latter type of
structures, we incorporate a CdSexS1-x alloy layer of controlled composition
and thickness between the CdSe core and the CdS shell. We observe that while
having essentially no effect on single-exciton decay, the interfacial alloy
layer leads to a systematic increase in biexciton lifetimes. This observation
provides direct experimental evidence that in addition to the size of the
quantum dot, its interfacial properties also significantly affect the rate of
Auger recombination, which governs biexciton decay. These findings help
rationalize previous observations of a significant heterogeneity in the
biexciton lifetimes across similarly sized quantum dots and should facilitate
the development of Auger-recombination-free colloidal nanostructures for a
range of applications from lasers and light-emitting diodes to photodetectors
and solar cells.

(QD-LEDs) has been motivated by the exceptional color purity and spectral
tunability of QD emission as well as the amenability of QD materials to highly
scalable and inexpensive solution processing. One current challenge in the
QD-LED field has been a still incomplete understanding of the role of extrinsic
factors (e.g., recombination via QD surface defects) versus intrinsic processes
such as multicarrier Auger recombination or electron-hole separation due to
applied electric field in defining device efficiency. Here, we address this
problem with a study of excited-state dynamics in a series of structurally
engineered QDs, which is performed in parallel with characterization of their
performance upon incorporation into LEDs. The results of this study indicate
that under both zero and forward bias, a significant fraction of the QDs within
the active emitting layer is negatively charged and therefore, Auger
recombination represents an important factor limiting the efficiency of these
devices. We further observe that the onset of the LED efficiency roll-off is
also controlled by Auger recombination and can be shifted to higher currents by
using newly developed QDs with an intermediate alloy layer at the core-shell
interface introduced for suppression of Auger decay. Our findings suggest that
further improvement in the performance of QD-LEDs can be achieved by developing
effective approaches for controlling Auger recombination and/or minimizing the
effects of QD charging via improved balancing of electron and hole injection
currents.

planning is a heuristic approach where one tries to reuse previous experience

Plan reuse may offer an interesting alternative to plan generation in some
settings.
  We provide theoretical results that identify situations in which plan reuse
is provably tractable. We perform our analysis in the framework of
parameterized complexity, which supports a rigorous worst-case complexity
analysis that takes structural properties of the input into account in terms of
parameters. A central notion of parameterized complexity is fixed-parameter
tractability which extends the classical notion of polynomial-time tractability
by utilizing the effect of structural properties of the problem input.
  We draw a detailed map of the parameterized complexity landscape of several
variants of problems that arise in the context of case-based planning. In
particular, we consider the problem of reusing an existing plan, imposing
various restrictions in terms of parameters, such as the number of steps that
can be added to the existing plan to turn it into a solution of the planning

cryp-tography, and quantum computation [1].To date, controlled unitary
interactions applied to a quantum system, so-called ""quantum gates"", have been
the most widely used method to deterministically create entanglement [2]. These
processes require high-fidelity state preparation as well as minimizing the
decoherence that inevitably arises from coupling between the system and the
environment and imperfect control of the system parameters. Here, on the
contrary, we combine unitary processes with engineered dissipation to
deterministically produce and stabilize an approximate Bell state of two
trapped-ion qubits independent of their initial state. While previous works
along this line involved the application of sequences of multiple
time-dependent gates [3] or generated entanglement of atomic ensembles
dissipatively but relied on a measurement record for steady-state entanglement
[4], we implement the process in a continuous time-independent fashion,
analogous to optical pumping of atomic states. By continuously driving the
system towards steady-state, the entanglement is stabilized even in the
presence of experimental noise and decoherence. Our demonstration of an
entangled steady state of two qubits represents a step towards dissipative
state engineering, dissipative quantum computation, and dissipative phase
transitions [5-7]. Following this approach, engineered coupling to the
environment may be applied to a broad range of experimental systems to achieve
desired quantum dynamics or steady states. Indeed, concurrently with this work,
an entangled steady state of two superconducting qubits was demonstrated using
dissipation [8].

communication systems, such as IEEE 802.16m and 3GPP LTE-A. The channel
resources allocation in multi-carrier multi-access channel, which can greatly
improve the system throughput with QoS assurance, thus attracted much attention
from both academia and industry. There lacks, however, an analytic framework
with a comprehensive performance metric, such that it is difficult to fully
exploit the potentials of channel allocation. This paper will propose an
analytic coded fmatching framework, where the outage exponent region (OER) will
be defined as the performance metric. The OER determines the relationship of
the outage performance among all of the users in the full SNR range, and
converges to the diversity-multiplexing region (DMR) when SNR tends to
infinity. To achieve the optimal OER and DMR, the random bipartite graph (RBG)
approach, only depending on 1 bit CSI, will be proposed to formulate this

combinatorial structure of the RBG based coded f-matching with the help of
saddlepoint approximation, the outage probability of each user, OER, and DMR
will be derived in closed-form formulas. It will be shown that all of the users
share the total multiplexing gain according to their rate requirements, while
achieving the full frequency diversity, i.e., the optimal OER and DMR. Based on

solutions, they are all essentially ad-hoc constructions, with little theory
behind them other than proofs of correctness. Since Safra, all optimal
constructions employ trees as states of the deterministic automaton, and
transitions between states are defined operationally over these trees. The
operational nature of these constructions complicates understanding,
implementing, and reasoning about them, and should be contrasted with
complementation, where a solid theory in terms of automata run DAGs underlies
modern constructions.
  In 2010, we described a profile-based approach to Buchi complementation,
where a profile is simply the history of visits to accepting states. We
developed a structural theory of profiles and used it to describe a
complementation construction that is deterministic in the limit. Here we extend
the theory of profiles to prove that every run DAG contains a profile tree with
at most a finite number of infinite branches. We then show that this property
provides a theoretical grounding for a new determinization construction where
macrostates are doubly preordered sets of states. In contrast to extant
determinization constructions, transitions in the new construction are
described declaratively rather than operationally.

syntactic level (part of the formula) to a semantic one (part of the model).
This allows us to track the evolution of the resource availability along the
computations and provides us with a formalisms capable to model a number of
real-world scenarios. Two relevant aspects are the notion of global
availability of the resources on the market, that are shared by the agents, and
the notion of price of resources, depending on their availability. In a
previous work of ours, an initial step towards this new formalism was
introduced, along with an EXPTIME algorithm for the model checking problem. In
this paper we better analyze the features of the proposed formalism, also in
comparison with previous approaches. The main technical contribution is the
proof of the EXPTIME-hardness of the the model checking problem for PRBATL,
based on a reduction from the acceptance problem for Linearly-Bounded
Alternating Turing Machines. In particular, since the problem has multiple

usually purported when the neutralino-sbottom mass difference m_sbottom-m_chi
is equal to the bottom quark mass m_b ~ 4 GeV. Such a scenario has been
discussed as a viable model for light (~ 10 GeV) neutralino dark matter as
explanation of possible DAMA and CoGeNT direct detection signals. Here we give
physical and analytical arguments showing that the sbottom resonance may
actually not be there. In particular, we show analytically that the one-loop
gluon-neutralino scattering amplitude has no pole at m_sbottom=m_chi+m_b, while
by analytic continuation to the regime m_sbottom<m_chi, it develops a pole at
m_sbottom=m_chi-m_b. In the limit of vanishing gluon momenta, this pole
corresponds to the only cut of the neutralino self-energy diagram with a quark
and a squark running in the loop, when the decay process chi->squark+quark
becomes kinematically allowed. The pole can be interpreted as the formation of
a sbottom-antibottom-qqq or antisbottom-bottom qqq resonant state (where qqq
are the nucleon valence quarks), which is kinematically not accessible if the
neutralino is the LSP. Our analysis shows that the common practice of
estimating the neutralino-nucleon cross section by introducing an ad-hoc pole
at m_sbottom=m_chi+m_b into the effective four-fermion interaction (including
higher-twist effects) should be discouraged, since it corresponds to adding a
spurious pole to the scattering process at the center-of-mass energy sqrt(s)
m_chi m_sbottom-m_b. Our considerations can be extended from the specific case
of supersymmetry to other cases in which the dark matter particle scatters off
nucleons through the exchange of a b-flavored state almost degenerate to its

elements, there are positive correlations of high statistical significance,
although the amplitudes of the abundance variations are small. Removing
abundance trends with effective temperature and/or using a different pair of

correlations may reflect a combination of (a) He abundance variations and (b)
inhomogeneous chemical evolution in the pre- or proto-cluster environment.

preclude He as being the sole explanation. Regarding the latter, the
nucleosynthetic source(s) must have synthesised Na, alpha, Fe-peak and

no individual object can achieve such nucleosynthesis. We speculate that other,

conceptually new understanding of the strong angular asymmetry. In this compact
review we present some clarifications, corrections and further developments of
the approach, and provide a brief account of results previously discussed but
not reported in the literature. The cross symmetry compound nucleus $S$-matrix
correlations are obtained (i) starting from the unitary $S$-matrix
representation, (ii) by explicitly taking into account a process of energy
equilibration, and (iii) without taking the thermodynamic limit of an infinite
number of particles in the thermalized system. It is conjectured that the long
phase memory is due to the exponentially small total spin off-diagonal
resonance intensity correlations. This manifestly implies that the strong
angular asymmetry intimately relates to extremely small deviations of the
eigenfunction distribution from Gaussian law. The spin diagonal resonance
intensity correlations determine a new time/energy scale for a validity of
random matrix theory. Its definition does not involve overlaps of the many-body
interacting configurations with shell model non-interacting states and thus is
conceptually different from the physical meaning (inverse energy relaxation
time) of the spreading widths introduced by Wigner. Exact Gaussian distribution
of the resonance wave functions corresponds to the instantaneous phase
relaxation. We invite the nuclear reaction community for the competition to
describe, as the first challenge, the strong forward peaking in the typically
evaporation part of the proton spectra. This is necessary to initiate revealing
long-term misconduct in the heavily cross-disciplinary field, also important

kinetic equation for low frequency Alfv\'en waves. In this picture, heating and

extra carbon-ion attenuation per range shift by 0.45\%/cm due to compositional

influence of PE range compensators on tumor dose in carbon-ion radiotherapy.
\item[Methods] Carbon-ion radiation was modeled to be composed of primary
carbon ions and secondary particles, for each of which the dose and the
relative biological effectiveness (RBE) were estimated at a tumor depth in the
middle of spread-out Bragg peak. Assuming exponential behavior for attenuation
and yield of these components with depth, the PE effect on dose was calculated
for clinical carbon-ion beams and was partly tested by experiment. The
two-component model was integrated into a treatment-planning system and the PE
effect was estimated in two clinical cases. \item[Results] The attenuation per
range shift by PE was 0.1\%--0.3\%/cm in dose and 0.2\%--0.4\%/cm in
RBE-weighted dose, depending on energy and range-modulation width. This
translates into reduction of RBE-weighted dose by up to 3\% in extreme cases.
In the treatment-planning study, however, the effect on RBE-weighted dose to
tumor was typically within 1\% reduction. \item[Conclusions] The extra
attenuation of primary carbon ions in PE was partly compensated by increased
secondary particles for tumor dose. In practical situations, the PE range
compensators would normally cause only marginal errors as compared to intrinsic
uncertainties in treatment planning, patient setup, beam delivery, and clinical
response.

an increasing interest in optimizing distance and similarity functions, an area
of research known as metric learning. When data consist of feature vectors, a
large body of work has focused on learning a Mahalanobis distance. Less work
has been devoted to metric learning from structured objects (such as strings or
trees), most of it focusing on optimizing a notion of edit distance. We
identify two important limitations of current metric learning approaches.
First, they allow to improve the performance of local algorithms such as
k-nearest neighbors, but metric learning for global algorithms (such as linear
classifiers) has not been studied so far. Second, the question of the
generalization ability of metric learning methods has been largely ignored. In
this thesis, we propose theoretical and algorithmic contributions that address
these limitations. Our first contribution is the derivation of a new kernel
function built from learned edit probabilities. Our second contribution is a
novel framework for learning string and tree edit similarities inspired by the
recent theory of (e,g,t)-good similarity functions. Using uniform stability
arguments, we establish theoretical guarantees for the learned similarity that
give a bound on the generalization error of a linear classifier built from that
similarity. In our third contribution, we extend these ideas to metric learning
from feature vectors by proposing a bilinear similarity learning method that
efficiently optimizes the (e,g,t)-goodness. Generalization guarantees are
derived for our approach, highlighting that our method minimizes a tighter
bound on the generalization error of the classifier. Our last contribution is a

that the yields of light (anti)nuclei and (anti)hypertriton strongly depend on
the centrality, i.e. their yields decrease rapidly with the increase of
centrality bins; but their yield ratios are independent on centrality. These
theoretical results are consistent with the STAR and PHENIX data. Furthermore,
centrality distribution of $d$ ($\bar d$), $^3{He}$ ($^3{\bar{He}}$) and

processing systems. It is useful in visualization of the different objects
present in the image. In spite of the several methods available in the
literature, image segmentation still a challenging problem in most of image
processing applications. The challenge comes from the fuzziness of image
objects and the overlapping of the different regions. Detection of edges in an
image is a very important step towards understanding image features. There are
large numbers of edge detection operators available, each designed to be
sensitive to certain types of edges. The Quality of edge detection can be
measured from several criteria objectively. Some criteria are proposed in terms
of mathematical measurement, some of them are based on application and
implementation requirements. Since edges often occur at image locations
representing object boundaries, edge detection is extensively used in image
segmentation when images are divided into areas corresponding to different
objects. This can be used specifically for enhancing the tumor area in
mammographic images. Different methods are available for edge detection like
Roberts, Sobel, Prewitt, Canny, Log edge operators. In this paper a novel
algorithms for edge detection has been proposed for mammographic images. Breast
boundary, pectoral region and tumor location can be seen clearly by using this
method. For comparison purpose Roberts, Sobel, Prewitt, Canny, Log edge
operators are used and their results are displayed. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

magnetar. However, in the scenario involving with a black hole accretion
system, the energy flow from the fall-back accretion may be delayed for a
fall-back time $\sim t_{\rm fb}$. Thus we propose a delayed energy injection
model, the delayed energy would cause a notable rise to the Lorentz factor of
the external shock, which will ""generate"" a bump in the multiple band
afterglows. If the delayed time is very short, our model degenerates to the
previous models. Our model can well explain the significant re-brightening in
the optical and infrared light curves of GRB 081029 and GRB 100621A. A
considerable fall-back mass is needed to provide the later energy, this
indicates GRBs accompanied with fall-back material may be associated with a low
energy supernova so that fraction of the envelope can be survived during
eruption. The fall-back time can give meaningful information of the properties

liquid-liquid interface, we produce simple analytic expressions for the
dependence of the interface location on experimental parameters. We also show
that the phase diagram contains regions where liquid separation cannot occur
under any applied field. The analytic expression for the boundary
""electrostatic binodal"" line reveals that the regions' size and shape depend
strongly on the dielectric relation between the liquids. Moreover, we predict
the existence of an ""electrostatic spinodal"" line that identifies conditions
where the liquids are in a metastable state. We finally construct the phase
diagram for closed systems by mapping solutions onto those of an open system
via an effective liquid composition. For closed systems at a fixed temperature
and mixture composition, liquid separation occurs in a finite ""window"" of
surface potential (or charge density). Larger potentials or charge densities
counterintuitively destroy the interface, leading to liquid mixing. These
results give valuable guides for experiments by providing easily testable
predictions for how liquids behave in non-uniform electric fields.

extreme outflows of neutral hydrogen have been detected. However, due to the
limited spatial resolution of previous observations, the exact location of the
outflow was not able to be determined. In this letter, we present new higher
resolution VLA observations of the central regions of this radio source and
detect a fast outflow of HI with a FWZI velocity of \Delta v~1200 km/s
associated with the inner radio jet, approximately 0.5 kpc west of the central
core. We investigate possible mechanisms which could produce the observed HI
outflow and conclude that it is driven by the radio-jet. However, this outflow
of neutral hydrogen is located on the opposite side of the nucleus to the
outflow of ionised gas previously detected in this object. We calculate a mass
outflow rate in the range of 8-50 solar masses/yr corresponding to a kinetic
energy power injected back into the ISM of 1.38x10^{42} - 1.00x10^{43} erg/s or
0.01 - 0.08 percent of the Eddington luminosity. This places it just outside
the range required by some galaxy evolution simulations for negative feedback
from the AGN to be effective in halting star-formation within the galaxy.

Integrable defect perturbations are identified in conformal defect perturbation
theory. Then pure defect flows connecting integrable conformal defects are
described. We develop a defect truncated conformal space approach (DTCSA) to
analyze the one parameter family of integrable massive perturbations in finite

consisting of a set of planar, closed-packed, self-supporting straw tube layers
are under construction. The PANDA straw tubes will have also unique
characteristics in term of material budget and performance. They consist of
very thin mylar-aluminized cathodes which are made self-supporting by means of
the operation gas-mixture over-pressure. This solution allows to reduce at
maximum the weight of the mechanical support frame and hence the detector

charged particle trajectories, but also will help in low momentum (< 1 GeV)
particle identification via dE/dx measurements. This is a quite new approach
that PANDA tracking group has first tested with detailed Monte Carlo
simulations, and then with experimental tests of detector prototypes. This
paper addresses the design issues of the PANDA straw tube trackers and the

the relative importance of inter and intra-layer connections, we find that the

the various layers are structurally decoupled and they act as independent

size telescopes covering the central energy range of 100 GeV to 30 TeV.
NectarCAM will be finely pixelated (~ 1800 pixels for a 8 degree field of view,
FoV) in order to image atmospheric Cherenkov showers by measuring the charge
deposited within a few nanoseconds time-window. It will have additional
features like the capacity to record the full waveform with GHz sampling for
every pixel and to measure event times with nanosecond accuracy. An array of a
few tens of medium size telescopes, equipped with NectarCAMs, will achieve up
to a factor of ten improvement in sensitivity over existing instruments in the
energy range of 100 GeV to 10 TeV. The camera is made of roughly 250
independent read-out modules, each composed of seven photo-multipliers, with
their associated high voltage base and control, a read-out board and a
multi-service backplane board. The read-out boards use NECTAr (New Electronics
for the Cherenkov Telescope Array) ASICs which have the dual functionality of
analogue memories and Analogue to Digital Converter (ADC). The camera trigger
to be used will be flexible so as to minimize the read-out dead-time of the
NECTAr chips. We present the camera concept and the design and tests of the
various subcomponents. The design includes the mechanical parts, the cooling of
the electronics, the readout, the data acquisition, the trigger, the monitoring
and services.

variables. $\a$ is found to be $0.99 \pm 0.02$ (WMAP7+BAO+$H_0$) and $0.99 \pm
0.04$ (WMAP7). These values do not exclude possibility of acceleration at
1$\sigma$ hence giving viability to power-law cosmology in general. When
considering scenario of canonical scalar field dark energy with power-law
cosmology, we derive scalar field potential, exact scalar field solution and
equation of state parameter. We found that the scenario of power-law cosmology
containing dynamical canonical scalar field predicts present equation of state
parameter $w_{\phi, 0} = -0.449 \pm 0.030 $ while the $w$CDM with WMAP7 data
(model independent, $w$ constant) allows a maximum (+1$\sigma$) value of
$w_{\phi, 0}$ at -0.70 which is off the prediction range. However, in case of
varying $w_{\phi}$, the $w_{\phi, 0}$ value predicted from quintessential
power-law cosmology is allowed within 1$\sigma$ uncertainty.

  clusters with H.E.S.S","In Proceedings of the 33rd International Cosmic Ray Conference
  (ICRC2013), Rio de Janeiro (Brazil)",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Globular clusters (GCs) are established emitters of high-energy (HE, 100
MeV<E<100 GeV) \gamma-ray radiation which could originate from the cumulative
emission of the numerous millisecond pulsars (msPSRs) in the clusters' cores or
from inverse Compton (IC) scattering of relativistic leptons accelerated in the
GC environment. GCs could also constitute a new class of sources in the
very-high-energy (VHE, E>100 GeV) \gamma-ray regime, judging from the recent
detection of emission from the direction of Terzan 5 with the H.E.S.S.
telescope array.
  To search for VHE \gamma-ray sources associated with other GCs, and to put
constraints on leptonic emission models, we systematically analyzed the
observations towards 15 GCs taken with H.E.S.S. We searched for individual
sources of VHE \gamma-rays from each GC in our sample and also performed a
stacking analysis combining the data from all GCs to investigate the hypothesis
of a population of faint emitters. Assuming IC emission as the source of
emission from Terzan 5, we calculated the expected \gamma-ray flux for each of
the 15 GCs, based on their number of millisecond pulsars, their optical
brightness and the energy density of background photon fields.
  We did not detect significant emission from any of the 15 GCs. The obtained
flux upper limits allow to rule out the simple IC/msPSR scaling model for NGC
6388 and NGC 7078. The upper limits derived from the stacking analyses are
factors between 2 and 50 below the flux predicted by the simple leptonic model,
depending on the assumed source extent and the dominant target photon fields.
Therefore, Terzan 5 still remains exceptional among all GCs, as the VHE
\gamma-ray emission either arises from extra-ordinarily efficient leptonic
processes, or from a recent catastrophic event, or is even unrelated to the GC
itself.

  Developments in Surface Science' (Transworld Research, India, 2013)",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Topological insulators (TIs) are materials that have a bulk electronic band
gap like an ordinary insulator but have protected conducting states on their
surface. One of the most interesting properties of TIs is their spin helicity,
whereby the spin is locked normal to the wave vector of the surface electronic
state. The topological surface states should be very stable in TIs, since these
spin-textured surface states are robust against spin-independent
backscattering. Scattering from defects and other lattice imperfections is
possible provided the spin is not completely flipped. However, the quality of
TI crystals can be controlled by careful growth, whereas phonons will exist in
even the most perfect crystals. Consequently, electron-phonon coupling (EPC)
should be the dominant scattering mechanism for surface electronic states at
finite temperatures. Hence, the study of EPC in TIs is of exceptional
importance in assessing any potential applications. In this article both
experimental and theoretical studies of the EPC on the surface of TIs are
reviewed, with the contents mainly focused on the typical strong three
dimensional TIs, such as Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3.

1$-$0) and C$^{18}$O (J = 1$-$0) line emission towards N4 were carried out. We
analyzed the spectral profile and the distribution of the molecular gas.
Morphologically, the CO emissions correlate well with Spitzer IRAC 8.0 $\mu$m
emission. The channel map and velocity-position diagram shows that N4 is more
likely an inclined expanding ring than a spherical bubble. We calculated the
physical parameters of N4 including the mass, size, column density and optical
depth. Some massive star candidates were discovered in the region of N4 using
(J, J$-$H) color-magnitude diagram. We found an energy source candidate for the
expansion of N4, a massive star with a mass of ${\sim} 15\,M_{\odot}$ and an
age of $\sim$ 1 Myr. There exists infall motion signature in N4, which can be a
good candidate of infall area. Combined mm and infrared data, we think there
may exists triggered star formation in N4.

modern computer architectures, ranging from handheld devices to large-scale HPC
systems; yet many applications are struggling to fully utilise the multiple
levels of parallelism exposed in modern high-performance platforms. In order to
realise the full potential of recent hardware advances, a mixed-mode between
shared-memory programming techniques and inter-node message passing can be
adopted which provides high-levels of parallelism with minimal overheads. For
scientific applications this entails that not only the simulation code itself,
but the whole software stack needs to evolve. In this paper, we evaluate the
mixed-mode performance of PETSc, a widely used scientific library for the
scalable solution of partial differential equations. We describe the addition
of OpenMP threaded functionality to the library, focusing on sparse
matrix-vector multiplication. We highlight key challenges in achieving good
parallel performance, such as explicit communication overlap using task-based
parallelism, and show how to further improve performance by explicitly load
balancing threads within MPI processes. Using a set of matrices extracted from
Fluidity, a CFD application code which uses the library as its linear solver
engine, we then benchmark the parallel performance of mixed-mode PETSc across
multiple nodes on several modern HPC architectures. We evaluate the parallel
scalability on Uniform Memory Access (UMA) systems, such as the Fujitsu
PRIMEHPC FX10 and IBM BlueGene/Q, as well as a Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA)
Cray XE6 platform. A detailed comparison is performed which highlights the
characteristics of each particular architecture, before demonstrating efficient
strong scalability of sparse matrix-vector multiplication with significant
speedups over the pure-MPI mode.

derive a new form for the local Karman-Howarth equation for forced isotropic
turbulence in real space. This equation is then cast into a dimensionless form,
from which a combined analytical and numerical study leads us to deduce a new
model for the scale-independent nondimensional dissipation rate $\Ceps$, which
takes the form $\Ceps = \Cinf + C_L/R_L$, where the asymptotic value $\Cinf$
can be evaluated from the third-order structure function. This is found to fit
the numerical data with $\Cinf = 0.47 \pm 0.01$ and $C_L= 18.5 \pm 1.3$. By
considering $\Ceps - \Cinf$ on logarithmic scales, we show that $R_L^{-1}$ is
indeed the correct Reynolds number behaviour. The model is compared to previous
attempts in the literature, with encouraging agreement. The effects of the
scale-dependence of the inertial and viscous terms due to finite forcing are
then considered and shown to compensate one another, such that the model
equation is applicable for systems subject to finite forcing. In addition, we
also show that, contrary to the case of freely decaying turbulence, the
characteristic decline in $\Ceps$ with increasing Reynolds number is due to the
\emph{increase} in the surrogate expression $U^3/L$; the dissipation rate being
maintained constant as a consequence of the fixed rate of forcing. A long-time
non-turbulent stable state is found to exist for low Reynolds number numerical
simulations which use negative damping as a means of energy injection.

This AGN, called AGN.1317, is located in the neighbourhood of the central radio
galaxy at a projected distance of ~780 kpc. The IRAM Plateau de Bure
Interferometer was used to investigate the molecular gas quantity in AGN.1317,
observing the 12CO(2-1) emission line. We detect CO emission in an AGN

theoretically derived responses of stellar spectra and line indices to element

applied in a differential way, to base models, in order to generate spectra or

functions for three different stellar evolutionary stages are tested with new
empirical [Mg/Fe] abundance data for the MILES stellar spectral library. Recent
theoretical models and observations are used to investigate the effects of
[Fe/H], [Mg/H] and overall [Z/H] on spectra, via ratios of spectra for similar
stars. Global effects of changes in abundance patterns are investigated
empirically through direct comparisons of similar stars from the MILES library,
highlighting the impact of abundance effects in the blue part of the spectrum,
particularly for lower temperature stars. It is found that the relative
behaviour of iron sensitive line indices are generally well predicted by
response functions, whereas Balmer line indices are not. Other indices tend to
show large scatter about the predicted mean relations. Implications for element
abundance and age studies in stellar populations are discussed and ways forward
are suggested to improve the match with behaviours of spectra and line strength

justification have been employed to address the fundamental question: When does
$\ell_1$-minimization find the sparsest solution to an underdetermined linear
system? In this paper, a deterministic analysis, rooted in the classic linear
programming theory, is carried out to further address this question. We first
identify a necessary and sufficient condition for the uniqueness of least
$\ell_1$-norm solutions to linear systems. From this condition, we deduce that
a sparsest solution coincides with the unique least $\ell_1$-norm solution to a
linear system if and only if the so-called \emph{range space property} (RSP)
holds at this solution. This yields a broad understanding of the relationship
between $\ell_0$- and $\ell_1$-minimization problems. Our analysis indicates
that the RSP truly lies at the heart of the relationship between these two
problems. Through RSP-based analysis, several important questions in this field
can be largely addressed. For instance, how to efficiently interpret the gap
between the current theory and the actual numerical performance of
$\ell_1$-minimization by a deterministic analysis, and if a linear system has
multiple sparsest solutions, when does $\ell_1$-minimization guarantee to find
one of them? Moreover, new matrix properties (such as the \emph{RSP of order
$K$} and the \emph{Weak-RSP of order $K$}) are introduced in this paper, and a
new theory for sparse signal recovery based on the RSP of order $K$ is
established.

causing the clustering of some chemical elements into disparate structures on

changes of mCP candidates recently revealed in the nearby Large Magellanic

other galaxies. We queried for photometry at the Optical Gravitational Lensing
Experiment (OGLE)-III survey of published mCP candidates selected because of
the presence of the characteristic 5200A flux depression. In total, the
intersection of both sources resulted in twelve stars. We performed our own and
standard periodogram time series analyses of all available data. The final
results are, amongst others, the frequency of the maximum peak and the
bootstrap probability of its reality. We detected that only two mCP candidates,
190.1 1581 and 190.1 15527, may show some weak rotationally modulated light
variations with periods of 1.23 and 0.49 days; however, the 49% and 32%

other 10 mCP candidates is too low to be detectable by their V and I OGLE

candidates sample can be explained by the absence of photometric spots of
overabundant optically active chemical elements. The unexpected LMC mCPs
behaviour is probably caused by different conditions during the star formation

characterization of the utility indifference price (UIP) for a large class of

structure of the model allows us to employ some BSDE techniques (in particular,
a Malliavin-type representation theorem due to Ma (2002)) to prove the
regularity of Z and to characterize the UIP for possibly discontinuous European
payoffs as a viscosity solution of a suitable PDE with continuous space

decoding in physical-layer network coding (PNC) systems. In PNC, multiple users
transmit to a relay simultaneously. PNC channel decoding is different from
conventional multi-user channel decoding: specifically, the PNC relay aims to
decode a network-coded message rather than the individual messages of the
users. Although prior work has shown that PNC can significantly improve the
throughput of a relay network, the improvement is predicated on the
availability of accurate channel estimates. Channel estimation in PNC, however,
can be particularly challenging because of 1) the overlapped signals of
multiple users; 2) the correlations among data symbols induced by channel
coding; and 3) time-varying channels. We combine the expectation-maximization
(EM) algorithm and belief propagation (BP) algorithm on a unified factor-graph
framework to tackle these challenges. In this framework, channel estimation is
performed by an EM subgraph, and channel decoding is performed by a BP subgraph
that models a virtual encoder matched to the target of PNC channel decoding.
Iterative message passing between these two subgraphs allow the optimal
solutions for both to be approached progressively. We present extensive
simulation results demonstrating the superiority of our PNC receivers over
other PNC receivers.

this part by a convergent series of Pietarinen functions. As the analytic
structure of the non-singular part is usually very well known (physical cuts
with branch points at inelastic thresholds, and unphysical cuts in the negative
energy plane), we find that one Pietarinen series per cut represents the
analytic structure fairly reliably. The number of terms in each Pietarinen
series is determined by the quality of the fit. The method is tested in two

terms, and two physical cuts, and on several sets of realistic piN elastic

regulates central aspects of cell physiology such as nutrient uptake,
modulation of signal transduction, synaptic transmission and membrane
turn-over. Endocytic vesicle formation depends on the timed production of
specific phosphoinositides and their interactions with various endocytic
proteins. Recently, it has been found that
phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2) produced by the class II
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase C2alpha plays a key role in the recruitment of
the PX-BAR domain protein SNX9, which is proposed to play a role in the
constriction of the endocytic vesicle neck [Posor et al, Nature 499, p233
(2013)]. Interestingly, SNX9 and its close paralog SNX18 are not fully specific
to PI(3,4)P2 but can also bind other phospholipids, in particular to PI(4,5)P2,
an abundant plasma membrane lipid required for the recruitment of many
endocytic proteins. In order to understand the dynamical interplay between
phospholipids and endocytic proteins, we developed a computational model of the
temporal changes in the population of the phosphoinositide-associated endocytic
proteins and their spatial distribution at a clathrin-coated pit (CCP). The
model resolves single molecules in time and space, and incorporates the complex
interplay of proteins and lipids, as well as their movement within the CCP. We
find that the comparably small differences in lipid binding affinities of
endocytic proteins are amplified by competition among them, allowing for the

the total momentum $Q$. The dispersion relations for the two opposite-helicity

steady-state solutions of a long-wave evolution equation for the film

expansion of solutions in the bath region. The presence of the temperature
gradient significantly changes these expansions and leads to the presence of
logarithmic terms that are absent otherwise. Next, we obtain numerical
solutions of the steady-state equation and analyse the behaviour of the
solutions as the plate velocity is changed. We observe that the bifurcation
curve exhibits snaking behaviour when the plate inclination angle is beyond a
certain critical value. Otherwise, the bifurcation curve is monotonic. The
solutions along these curves are characterised by a foot-like structure that is
formed close to the meniscus and is preceded by a thin precursor film further
up the plate. The length of the foot increases along the bifurcation curve.
Finally, we explain that the snaking behaviour of the bifurcation curves is
caused by the existence of an infinite number of heteroclinic orbits close to a
heteroclinic chain that connects in an appropriate three-dimensional phase

we show that actuator density for the MOAO DMs can be reduced with little
performance loss. We note that this reduction is only possible with the
addition of a GL DM, whose order is greater than or equal to that of the
original MOAO mirrors. The addition of a GL DM of lesser order does not affect
system performance (if tip/tilt star sharpening is ignored). We also quantify
the maximum mechanical DM stroke requirements (3.5 $\mu$m desired) and provide
tolerances for the DM alignment accuracy, both lateral (to within an eighth of
a sub-aperture) and rotational (to within 0.2$^\circ$). By presenting results
over a range of laser guide star asterism diameters, we ensure that these

positively definite fermion determinant and the lattice simulation can be
successfully performed. While the two-flavor effective models may be sufficient
to describe the phenomenon of pion condensation, it is interesting to study the
roles of the strangeness degree of freedom and the U$_{\rm A}(1)$ anomaly. In
this paper, we present a systematic study of the three-flavor
Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model with a Kobayashi-Maskawa-'t Hooft (KMT) term that
mimics the U$_{\rm A}(1)$ anomaly at finite isospin chemical potential. In the
mean-field approximation, the model predicts a phase transition from the vacuum
to the pion superfluid phase, which takes place at $\mu_{\rm I}$ equal to the
pion mass $m_\pi$. Due to the U$_{\rm A}(1)$ anomaly, the strangeness degree of
freedom couples to the light quark degrees of freedom and the strange quark
effective mass depends on the pion condensate. However, the strange quark
condensate and the strange quark effective mass change slightly in the pion
superfluid phase, which verifies the validity of the two-flavor models. The
effective four-fermion interaction of the Kobayashi-Maskawa-'t Hooft term in
the presence of the pion condensation is constructed. Due to the U$_{\rm A}(1)$
anomaly, the pion condensation generally induces scalar-pseudoscalar
interaction. The Bethe-Salpeter equation for the mesonic excitations is
established and the meson mass spectra are obtained at finite isospin chemical
potential and temperature. Finally, the general expression for the topological
susceptibility $\chi$ at finite isospin chemical potential $\mu_{\rm I}$ is
derived. In contrast to the finite temperature effect which suppresses $\chi$,
the isospin density effect leads to an enhancement of $\chi$.

binary stars, thereby potentially enhancing (or destroying) circumbinary
habitability. In single stars, stellar aggression towards planetary atmospheres
causes mass-loss, which is especially detrimental for late-type stars, because
habitable zones are very close and activity is long lasting. In binaries, tidal
rotational breaking reduces magnetic activity, thus reducing harmful levels of
XUV radiation and stellar mass-loss that are able to erode planetary
atmospheres. We study this mechanism for all confirmed circumbinary (p-type)
planets. We find that main sequence twins provide minimal flux variation and in
some cases improved environments, if the stars rotationally synchronize within
the first Gyr. Solar-like twins, like Kepler 34 and Kepler 35, provide low
habitable zone XUV fluxes and stellar wind pressures. These wide, moist,
habitable zones may potentially support multiple habitable planets. Solar-type
stars with lower mass companions, like Kepler 47, allow for protected planets
over a wide range of secondary masses and binary periods. Kepler 38 and related
binaries are marginal cases. Kepler 64 and analogues have dramatically reduced
stellar aggression due to synchronization of the primary, but are limited by
the short lifetime. Kepler 16 appears to be inhospitable to planets due to
extreme XUV flux. These results have important implications for estimates of
the number of stellar systems containing habitable planets in the Galaxy and
allow for the selection of binaries suitable for follow-up searches for
habitable planets.

Interesting features arise in the regime in which the probing light has to be
treated quantum mechanically. The maximum rate of reliable readout defines the
quantum reading capacity, which is proven to overcome the classical reading
capacity, obtained by probing with classical light, in several relevant
settings. We consider a model of optical memory in which information is encoded
in the (complex-valued) attenuation factor and study the effects on the reading
rates of thermal and correlated noise. The latter type of noise arises when the

theoretical level. Yet correspondence at the implementation level has been much
less explored. In this article we work towards relating them at the
implementation level. Concretely, we show how to derive the efficient Leapfrog
Triejoin execution algorithm of Datalog from a generic CP execution scheme.

small to accommodate two dopants in magnetized state, the larger Si24H24 cage
turns out to be suitable for such applications. For dimer dopants M2+ = Cr2+,
Mn2+ and CrMn+, the structural integrity of the host cage is conserved in the
ground-state structure of corresponding M2+@Si24H24 aggregates, as is the
unusually high spin state of the guest dopant, which in case of Cr2+ already
exceeds the single-atom dopant septet limit by almost a factor of two.

encapsulating an even larger number of dopants into a suitably sized

approach for different classes of AMP. Contrary to available approaches, we
suggest, that a strategy of prediction should be based on the fact, that there
are several kinds of AMP which are vary in mechanisms of action, structure,
mode of interaction with membrane etc. According to our suggestion for each
kind of AMP a particular approach has to be developed in order to get high
efficacy. Consequently in this paper a particular but the biggest class of AMP
- linear cationic antimicrobial peptides (LCAP) - has been considered and a
newly developed simple method of LCAP prediction described. The aim of this
study is the development of a simple method of discrimination of AMP from
non-AMP, the efficiency of which will be determined by efficiencies of selected
descriptors only and comparison the results of the discrimination procedure
with the results obtained by more complicated discriminative methods. As
descriptors the physicochemical characteristics responsible for capability of
the peptide to interact with an anionic membrane were considered. The following
characteristics such as hydrophobicity, amphiphaticity, location of the peptide
in relation to membrane, charge, propensity to disordered structure were
studied. On the basis of these characteristics a new simple algorithm of
prediction is developed and evaluation of efficacies of the characteristics as
descriptors performed. The results show that three descriptors: hydrophobic
moment, charge and location of the peptide along the membranes can be used as
discriminators of LCAPs. For the training set our method gives the same level
of accuracy as more complicated machine learning approaches offered as CAMP
database service tools. For the test set sensitivity obtained by our method
gives even higher value than the one obtained by CAMP prediction tools.

  Lagrangian Systems","Preliminary version in Proc. of IEEE American Control Conference 2013",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We obviate the use of observers for the purpose of output feedback tracking
control of Lagrangian systems and solve some long-standing yet well-documented
open problems. As often implemented in control practice, we replace unavailable
derivatives with approximate differentiation. Our contribution consists in
establishing uniform global asymptotic stability in closed-loop, for Lagrangian
systems without dissipative forces (friction) using only position feedback.
Firstly, for fully-actuated relative-degree-two systems, the controller is
reminiscent of passivity-based controllers for robot manipulators and consists
in a linear dynamic system together with a globally-Lipschitz control law.
Establishing a global uniform result, all the more with such a simple
controller, is particularly valuable relatively to the literature of
output-feedback control of systems with non-globally-Lipschitz nonlinearities
in the unmeasured variables. This first contribution solves a long-standing
open problem and, as a matter of fact, recasted in a general context this
result is at the edge of what is achievable -see [24]. Then, we show that our
control approach may be applied to a more general problem, that of tracking
control of Lagrangian systems augmented by a chain of integrators (with
relative degree greater than two). As a corollary, we solve the global-tracking
position-feedback control problem for flexible-joint robots but also for
systems coupled with output-feedback linearizable actuator dynamics. Finally,
we discuss remaining open problems of fairly general interest in the realm of
analysis and design of robust nonlinear systems.

flow-induced vibration problem that results in wear and failure of the fuel
rods in nuclear assemblies. In order to understand the fluid dynamics of GTRF
and to build an archival database of turbulence statistics for various
configurations, implicit large-eddy simulations of time-dependent single-phase
turbulent flow have been performed in 3x3 and 5x5 rod bundles with a single
grid spacer. To assess the computational mesh and resolution requirements, a
method for quantitative assessment of unstructured meshes with no-slip walls is
described. The calculations have been carried out using Hydra-TH, a
thermal-hydraulics code developed at Los Alamos for the Consortium for Advanced
Simulation of Light water reactors, a United States Department of Energy
Innovation Hub. Hydra-TH uses a second-order implicit incremental projection
method to solve the single-phase incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The
simulations explicitly resolve the large scale motions of the turbulent flow
field using first principles and rely on a monotonicity-preserving numerical
technique to represent the unresolved scales. Each series of simulations for
the 3x3 and 5x5 rod-bundle geometries is an analysis of the flow field
statistics combined with a mesh-refinement study and validation with available
experimental data. Our primary focus is the time history and statistics of the
forces loading the fuel rods. These hydrodynamic forces are believed to be the
key player resulting in rod vibration and GTRF wear, one of the leading causes
for leaking nuclear fuel which costs power utilities millions of dollars in
preventive measures. We demonstrate that implicit large-eddy simulation of
rod-bundle flows is a viable way to calculate the excitation forces for the
GTRF problem.

possess a wide spectrum of binding energies that exceed, in many cases, the
values known at the present time. The transition of the nuclear matter in the
form of ordinary nuclei (drops of the nuclear fluid) in the state with the
fractal structure or in the form of bubble nuclei opens new sources of energy
and has huge perspectives. This transition is based on a new state of matter -
collective coherently correlated state. It manifests itself, first of all, in
the property of nonlocality of nuclear multiparticle processes. We develop a
phenomenological theory of the binding energy of nuclear fractal structures and
modify the Bethe - Weizs\""acker formula for nuclear clusters with the mass
number A, charge Z, and fractal dimension D_f. The consideration of fractal
nuclear isomers allows one to interpret the experimental results on a new level
of the comprehension of processes of the nuclear dynamics. The possibility to
determine the fractal dimension of nuclear systems with the help of the method
of nuclear dipole resonance for fractal isomers is discussed. The basic

decoherence time T_2 within the framework of the Bloch-Redfield theory. In this
model, the emergence of a non-monotonic dependence of T_1 on the external
magnetic field is attributed to the Rashba spin-orbit coupling-induced
anticrossing of opposite spin states. A rapid decrease of T_1 occurs when the
spin and orbital relaxation rates become comparable in the vicinity of the
spin-mixing energy-level anticrossing. By contrast, the intrinsic spin-orbit
interaction leads to a monotonic magnetic field dependence of the spin
relaxation rate which is caused solely by the direct spin-phonon coupling
mechanism. Within our model, we demonstrate that the decoherence time T_2 ~ 2
T_1 is dominated by relaxation processes for the electron-phonon coupling
mechanisms in graphene up to leading order in the spin-orbit interaction.
Moreover, we show that the energy anticrossing also leads to a vanishing pure
spin dephasing rate for these states for a super-Ohmic bath.

predicted in nuclear physics, these striking bosonic states are hard to
observe, but the ""unitary"" interactions at which they form is commonly realized
in current cold atoms experiments. There, they set the stage for a new class of
universal physics: Two-body interactions are all but invisible, but three-body
effects allow the emergence of a largely uncharted new world of many-particle

ground-state properties of small unitary clusters computed numerically, but the
macroscopic many-body behaviour has remained unknown. Here we show, using a
Path-Integral Monte Carlo algorithm backed up by theoretical arguments, that
the unitary Bose gas presents a first-order phase transition from a normal gas
to a superfluid Efimov liquid. The normal gas is very well described by the
available virial coefficients. At unitarity, the phase diagram of the bosonic
system is universal in rescaled pressure and temperature. A triple point
separates the normal gas, the superfluid Efimov liquid, and a third phase, the
conventional superfluid gas. These two superfluid phases are separated by a
critical line that ends in a critical point at high temperature. This rich
phase diagram should allow for a number of experimental protocols that would
probe these universal transitions between the normal gas, the superfluid gas,

included the sampling of a full planetary rotation, a relevant timescale to
investigate auroral emissions driven by processes internal to the

substorm-like event in the magnetotail, which induced an overall dawnside
intensification of the magnetospheric and auroral activity. We comparatively
analyze this unique set of measurements to reach a comprehensive view of
kronian auroral processes over the investigated timescale. We identify three
source regions in atmospheric aurorae, including a main oval associated with
the bulk of Saturn Kilometric Radiation (SKR), together with polar and
equatorward emissions. These observations reveal the co-existence of
corotational and sub-corototational dynamics of emissions associated with the
main auroral oval. Precisely, we show that the atmospheric main oval hosts
short-lived sub-corotating isolated features together with a bright,
longitudinally extended, corotating region locked at the southern SKR phase. We
assign the susbtorm-like event to a regular, internally driven, nightside ion
injection possibly triggerred by a plasmoid ejection. We also investigate the
total auroral energy budget, from the power input to the atmosphere,
characterized by precipitating electrons up to 20 keV, to its dissipation

positive and negative) magnetoresistance and strong negative differential
conductance can be achieved in this structure. Our study thus presents a new

that these black hole quantities receive the QED corrections, in comparison

corrections show the screening effect on black hole electric charges and the
paramagnetic effect on black hole magnetic charges. As a result, the black hole
horizon area, irreducible mass, and entropy increase; however, the black hole
total energy and maximally extractable energy decrease, compared with the

extremely charged black holes is modified due to the QED correction.

and the density is such that average distance between particles is smaller than

explosives can catalyze their gradual exothermic decomposition. Mechanisms
underlying such a charge-induced gradual thermal decomposition of highly
sensitive explosives can be different. If sensitive explosive is a polar
liquid, intense charge-dipole attraction between excess surface charges and
surrounding explosive molecules can result in repetitive attempts of solvation
of these charges by polar explosive molecules. Every attempt of such
uncompleted nonequilibrium solvation causes local exothermic decomposition of
thermolabile polar molecules accompanied by further thermal jumping unsolvated
excess charges to new surface sites. Thus, ionized mobile hot spots emerge on
charged explosive surface. Stochastic migration of ionized hot spots on
explosive surface causes gradual exothermic decomposition of the whole mass of
the polar explosive. The similar gradual charge-catalyzed exothermic
decomposition of both polar and nonpolar highly sensitive explosives can be
also caused by intense charge-dipole attacks of surrounding water vapor
molecules electrostatically attracted from ambient humid air and strongly
accelerated towards charged sites on explosive surfaces. Emission of electrons,
photons and heat from ionized hot spots randomly migrating on charged surface
of highly sensitive explosive aerosol nanoparticles converts such particles
into the form of short-circuited thermionic nanobatteries.

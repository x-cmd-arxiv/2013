yielded by cooperation can compensate the expense of higher energy due to

of the E1M1 two-photon transition 2s2p ^3P_0 - 2s^2 ^1S_0 can be extracted from
the lifetime of the ^3P_0 state in Be-like ions with zero nuclear spin by
employing resonant recombination in a storage-ring. This experimental approach
involves a perturbing external magnetic field. The effect of this field needs
to be evaluated in order to properly extract the two-photon rate from the
measured decay curves. The magnetic field induced transition rates are
carefully evaluated and it is shown that, with a typical storage-ring field
strength, it is dominant or of the same order as the E1M1 rate for low- and
mid-Z ions. Results for several field strengths and ions are presented and we
also give a simple Z-dependent formula for the rate. We estimate the
uncertainties of our model to be within 5% for low- and mid-Z ions, and
slightly larger for more highly charged ions. Furthermore we evaluate the
importance of including both perturber states, ^3P_1 and ^1P_1, and it is shown
that excluding the influence of the ^1P_1 perturber overestimates the rate by
up to 26% for the mid-Z ions.

difficult to analyze theoretically, because it stems from the strongly

Mode-coupling theory predicts the flow curves of materials undergoing a glass
transition, and thus offers predictions for the yield stress of amorphous
solids. We use this approach to analyse several classes of disordered solids,
using simple models of hard sphere glasses, soft glasses, and metallic glasses
for which the mode-coupling predictions can be directly compared to the outcome
of numerical measurements. The theory correctly describes the emergence of a
yield stress of entropic nature in hard sphere glasses, and its rapid growth as
density approaches random close packing at qualitative level. By contrast, the
emergence of solid behavior in soft and metallic glasses, which originates from
direct particle interactions is not well described by the theory. We show that
similar shortcomings arise in the description of the vibrational dynamics of
the glass phase at rest. We discuss the range of applicability of mode-coupling

transiting the closest and smallest main-sequence stars. In its first four
years, MEarth discovered one transiting exoplanet, the 2.7 Earth radius planet
GJ1214b. Here, we answer an outstanding question: in light of the bounty of
small planets transiting small stars uncovered by the Kepler mission, should
MEarth have found more than just one planet so far? We estimate MEarth's
ensemble sensitivity to exoplanets by performing end-to-end simulations of 1.25
million observations of 988 nearby mid-to-late M dwarfs, gathered by MEarth
between October 2008 and June 2012. For 2-4 Earth radius planets, we compare
this sensitivity to results from Kepler and find that MEarth should have found
planets at a rate of 0.05 - 0.36 planets/year in its first four years. As part
of this analysis, we provide new analytic fits to the Kepler early M dwarf
planet occurrence distribution. When extrapolating between Kepler's early M
dwarfs and MEarth's mid-to-late M dwarfs, we find that assuming the planet
occurrence distribution stays fixed with respect to planetary equilibrium
temperature provides a good match to our detection of a planet with GJ1214b's
observed properties. For larger planets, we find that the warm (600-700K),
Neptune-sized (4 Earth radius) exoplanets that transit early M dwarfs like
Gl436 and GJ3470 occur at a rate of <0.15/star (at 95% confidence) around
MEarth's later M dwarf targets. We describe a strategy with which MEarth can
increase its expected planet yield by 2.5X without new telescopes, by shifting
its sensitivity toward the smaller and cooler exoplanets that Kepler has
demonstrated to be abundant.

the significance of proving no-go results should consist in clarifying the
fundamental structure of the theory, by pointing out a class of basic
constraints that the theory itself is supposed to satisfy. In the present paper
I will discuss some more recent no-go claims and I will argue against the deep
significance of these results, with a two-fold strategy. First, I will consider
three results concerning respectively local realism, quantum covariance and
predictive power in quantum mechanics, and I will try to show how controversial
the main conditions of the negative theorem turn out to be, something that
strongly undermines the general relevance of these theorems. Second, I will try
to discuss what I take to be a common feature of these theoretical enterprises,
namely that of aiming at establishing negative results for quantum mechanics in
absence of a deeper understanding of the overall ontological content and
structure of the theory. I will argue that the only way toward such an
understanding may be to cast in advance the problems in a clear and
well-defined interpretational framework, which in my view means primarily to
specify the ontology that quantum theory is supposed to be about, and after to
wonder whether problems that seemed worth pursuing still are so in the

that could impact array beamforming and the associated engineering

from external interference and internal acquisition process. Then, compressive
sensing based beamforming was studied in this work for those noisy measurements
with a signal-to-noise ratio. In this article, we firstly introduced the
fundamentals of compressive sensing theory. After that, we implemented two
algorithms (CSB-I and CSB-II). Both algorithms are proposed for those
presumably spatially sparse and incoherent signals. The two algorithms were
examined using a simple simulation case and a practical aeroacoustic test case.
The simulation case clearly shows that the CSB-I algorithm is quite sensitive
to the sensing noise. The CSB-II algorithm, on the other hand, is more robust
to noisy measurements. The results by CSB-II at $\mathrm{SNR}=-10\,$dB are
still reasonable with good resolution and sidelobe rejection. Therefore,
compressive sensing beamforming can be considered as a promising array signal
beamforming method for those measurements with inevitably noisy interference.

structural materials and small-scale devices that have components or
microstructural elements at the nanometer length scale. No consensus exists on
the effect of flaws on fracture in bulk nanostructured materials or in
nanostructures. Proposed theories include nanoscale flaw tolerance and
maintaining macroscopic fracture relationships at the nanoscale with virtually
no experimental support. We explore fracture mechanisms in nanomaterials via
nanomechanical experiments on nanostructures with pre-fabricated surface flaws
in combination with molecular dynamics simulations. Nanocrystalline Pt
cylinders with diameters of 120 nm with intentionally introduced surface
notches were created using a template-assisted electroplating method and tested
in uniaxial tension in in-situ SEM. Experiments demonstrate that 8 out of 12
samples failed at the notches and that tensile failure strengths were 1.8 GPa
regardless of whether failure occurred at or away from the flaw. These findings
suggest that failure location was sensitive to the presence of flaws, while
strength was flaw-insensitive. Molecular dynamics simulations support these
observations and show that incipient plastic deformation commences via
nucleation and motion of dislocations in concert with grain boundary sliding.
We postulate that such local plasticity reduces stress concentration ahead of
the flaw to levels comparable with the strengths of intrinsic microstructural
features like grain boundary triple junctions, a phenomenon unique to
nano-scale solids that contain an internal microstructural energy landscape.
This mechanism causes failure to occur at the weakest link, be it an internal
inhomogeneity or a surface feature with a high local stress.

arrive one by one over time. An online algorithm has to decide whether an

natural and practically relevant online problem cannot be studied in a
meaningful way within a classical competitive analysis as the competitive ratio
on worst-case input sequences is lower bounded by $\Omega(n)$.
  As a worst-case analysis is pointless, we study online independent set in a
stochastic analysis. Instead of focussing on a particular stochastic input
model, we present a generic sampling approach that enables us to devise online
algorithms achieving performance guarantees for a variety of input models. In
particular, our analysis covers stochastic input models like the secretary
model, in which an adversarial graph is presented in random order, and the
prophet-inequality model, in which a randomly generated graph is presented in
adversarial order. Our sampling approach bridges thus between stochastic input
models of quite different nature. In addition, we show that our approach can be
applied to a practically motivated admission control setting.
  Our sampling approach yields an online algorithm for maximum independent set
with competitive ratio $O(\rho^2)$ with respect to all of the mentioned
stochastic input models. for graph classes with inductive independence number
$\rho$. The approach can be extended towards maximum-weight independent set by
losing only a factor of $O(\log n)$ in the competitive ratio with $n$ denoting

using quantum cryptography, and complex scientific and engineering simulations
with quantum computing. Quantum computer nodes may be based on a variety of
systems, such as linear optics, ions, or solid state architectures such as
NV-centers in diamond, semiconductor quantum dots or spins in silicon.
Interfacing any of these platforms with photonic qubits in secure quantum
networks will require quantum teleportation protocols to transfer the
information, and matter-light teleportation has for some of these systems been
demonstrated. However, although it is conceivable that the input photon
originates from a dissimilar source to that supplying the entangled resources,
every demonstration so far of teleportation using linear optics use the same or
identical sources for the input and entangled photons, often accompanied by a
fourth heralding photon. Here we show that photons from fundamentally different
sources can be used in the optical quantum teleportation protocol. Input
photons are generated by a laser, and teleported using polarisation-entangled
photon pairs electrically generated by an entangled-light-emitting diode
(ELED). The sources have bandwidth differing by a factor 1000, different photon
statistics and need not be precisely degenerate- but we still observe a
teleportation fidelity of 0.77, beating the quantum limit by 10 standard
deviations. This is a significant leap towards practical applications, such as
extending the range of existing QKD systems using quantum relays and repeaters,
which usually use weak coherent laser pulses for quantum information transport.
The use of an ELED offers practical advantages of electrical control, and as we
show erases the multi-photon character of the laser input field, thus
eliminating errors if used in a quantum optics circuit.

models, which mimic realistic composition gradient configurations. The basic
features of the axial axisymmetric spectrum of normal fluid stars are
reproduced by our results and in addition we find several magneto-elastic waves
with a mixed character. In the core, these oscillations mimic the shear mode
pattern of the crust as a result of the strong dynamical coupling between these
two regions. Incorporating the most recent entrainment configurations in our
models, we find that they have a double effect on the spectrum: the magnetic
oscillations of the core have a frequency enhancement, while the mixed
magneto-elastic waves originating in the crust are moved towards the
frequencies of the single-fluid case. The distribution of lower-frequency
magneto-elastic oscillations for our models is qualitatively similar to the
observed magnetar QPOs with $\nu < 155 $Hz. \emph{In particular, some of these
QPOs could represent mixed magneto-elastic oscillations with frequencies not
greatly different from the crustal modes of an unmagnetised star.} We find that

polar field of $B_{p} \simeq 3\cdot 10^{14}$G, because of the superfluid
enhancement of magnetic oscillations. Finally, we discuss the possible

of other tidal debris in its halo, much of which is thought to be directly
associated with the southern stream. We model this structure by means of
Bayesian sampling of parameter space, where each sample uses an N-body
simulation of a satellite disrupting in M31's potential. We combine constraints
on stellar surface densities from the Isaac Newton Telescope survey of M31 with
kinematic data and photometric distances. This combination of data tightly
constrains the model, indicating a stellar mass at last pericentric passage of
log(M_s / Msun) = 9.5+-0.1, comparable to the LMC. Any existing remnant of the
satellite is expected to lie in the NE Shelf region beside M31's disk, at
velocities more negative than M31's disk in this region. This rules out the
prominent satellites M32 or NGC 205 as the progenitor, but an overdensity
recently discovered in M31's NE disk sits at the edge of the progenitor
locations found in the model. M31's virial mass is constrained in this model to
be log(M200) = 12.3+-0.1, alleviating the previous tension between
observational virial mass estimates and expectations from the general galactic
population and the timing argument. The techniques used in this paper, which
should be more generally applicable, are a powerful method of extracting
physical inferences from observational data on tidal debris structures.

of the two leading terms. Exact (approximated) self-similarity of an
Einstein-de Sitter ($\Lambda$CDM) background fixes the time dependence so that
the vorticity power spectrum at leading order is determined by the symmetries

to cancel all divergences in the velocity correlators one needs new
counterterms. These fix the definition of velocity and do not represent new

energy transfer (LET) of 57.9 MeV cm^{2}/mg is used to measure the single event
latch-up (SEL) tolerance, which results in a sufficiently low cross-section of
sigma_{SEL} < 4.2x10^{-11} cm^{2}/(IonxASIC). The single event upset (SEU)
tolerance is estimated with various kinds of species with wide range of energy.
Taking into account that a part of the protons creates recoiled heavy ions that
has higher LET than that of the incident protons, we derived the probability of
SEU event as a function of LET. Then the SEE event rate in a low-earth orbit is
estimated considering a simulation result of LET spectrum. SEL rate is below
once per 49 years, which satisfies the required latch-up tolerance. The upper
limit of the SEU rate is derived to be 1.3x10^{-3}events/sec. Although the SEU
events cannot be distinguished from the signals of X-ray photons from
astronomical objects, the derived SEU rate is below 1.3% of expected non-X-ray
background rate of the detector and hence these events should not be a major

sparse high-dimensional settings. The traditional likelihood-based estimators
lack resilience against outliers, a critical issue when dealing with
high-dimensional noisy data. Our method, Minimum Distance Lasso (MD-Lasso),
combines minimum distance functionals, customarily used in nonparametric
estimation for their robustness, with l1-regularization for high-dimensional
regression. The geometry of MD-Lasso is key to its consistency and robustness.
The estimator is governed by a scaling parameter that caps the influence of
outliers: the loss per observation is locally convex and close to quadratic for
small squared residuals, and flattens for squared residuals larger than the
scaling parameter. As the parameter approaches infinity, the estimator becomes
equivalent to least-squares Lasso. MD-Lasso enjoys fast convergence rates under
mild conditions on the model error distribution, which hold for any of the
solutions in a convexity region around the true parameter and in certain cases
for every solution. Remarkably, a first-order optimization method is able to
produce iterates very close to the consistent solutions, with geometric
convergence and regardless of the initialization. A connection is established
with re-weighted least-squares that intuitively explains MD-Lasso robustness.
The merits of our method are demonstrated through simulation and eQTL data
analysis.

the satellites Puck, Mab,Portia, and Rosalind. These rings are tenuous and
dominated by micrometric particles, which can be strongly disturbed by the
solar radiation pressure. We performed a numerical analysis of the orbital
evolution of a sample of particles under the influence of the solar radiation
force and the planetary oblateness, combined with the gravitational interaction
with the close satellites. The most likely result is a collisions and the
deposition of particles onto the surface of these satellites. Since this
mechanism tends to cause a depletion of material of the rings, we investigate
additional sources for these dust particles. Adopting a rough estimative of the
flux of interplanetary meteoroids, we found that the ejections from Mab could
generate a ring with optical depth comparable with the observations.
  A similar analysis was carried out for the F-ring dust band. The damping due
to the Saturn's oblateness prevents the overstated changes of the eccentricity
and increases in the lifetime of the particles. Therewithal photometric study
of the F-ring using Cassini images revealed that substantial secular increase
in the brightness of Saturn's F ring has occurred in the last 25 years. The
shapes of the phase curves from Cassini and Voyager are similar, suggesting
that although the number of dust particles has increased, the overall
distribution of sizes is unchanged.
  The dust bands that permeate the rings of Uranus were observed late in 2007
during the equinox, when the Sun crossed the ring plane. Images taken with the
VLT were processed and then combined to result in long-exposure frames. For
each frame, the north and south radial profiles were extracted. They will be
used to develop a photometric model.

question with rich history in neuroscience is how these noise correlations
impact the population's ability to encode the stimulus. Here, we consider a
very general setting for population coding, investigating how information
varies as a function of noise correlations, with all other aspects of the
problem - neural tuning curves, etc. - held fixed. This work yields unifying
insights into the role of noise correlations. These are summarized in the form
of theorems, and illustrated with numerical examples involving neurons with
diverse tuning curves. Our main contributions are as follows.
  (1) We generalize previous results to prove a sign rule (SR) - if noise
correlations between pairs of neurons have opposite signs vs. their signal
correlations, then coding performance will improve compared to the independent
case. This holds for three different metrics of coding performance, and for
arbitrary tuning curves and levels of heterogeneity. This generality is true
for our other results as well.
  (2) As also pointed out in the literature, the SR does not provide a
necessary condition for good coding. We show that a diverse set of correlation
structures can improve coding. Many of these violate the SR, as do
experimentally observed correlations. There is structure to this diversity: we
prove that the optimal correlation structures must lie on boundaries of the
possible set of noise correlations.
  (3) We provide a novel set of necessary and sufficient conditions, under
which the coding performance (in the presence of noise) will be as good as it
would be if there were no noise present at all.

and studied as a function of $p_{\rm T}$ and in intervals of event
multiplicity. In high-multiplicity events, the second-order coefficient for
protons, $v_2^p$, is observed to be smaller than that for pions, $v_2^\pi$, up
to about $p_{\rm T} = 2$ GeV/$c$. To reduce correlations due to jets, the
per-trigger yield measured in low-multiplicity events is subtracted from that
in high-multiplicity events. A two-ridge structure is obtained for all particle
species. The Fourier decomposition of this structure shows that the
second-order coefficients for pions and kaons are similar. The $v_2^p$ is found
to be smaller at low $p_{\rm T}$ and larger at higher $p_{\rm T}$ than
$v_2^pi$, with a crossing occurring at about 2 GeV. This is qualitatively
similar to the elliptic-flow pattern observed in heavy-ion collisions. A mass
ordering effect at low transverse momenta is consistent with expectations from
hydrodynamic model calculations assuming a collectively expanding system.

of core-softened fluids inside nanotubes. Our results reveal a anomalous
increase of the overall mass flux for nanotubes with sufficiently smaller
radii. This is explained in terms of a transition from a single-file type of
flow to the movement of an ordered-like fluid as the nanotube radius increases.
The occurrence of a global minimum in the mass flux at this transition reflects
the competition between the two characteristics length scales of the
core-softened potential. Moreover, by increasing further the radius, another
substantial change in the flow behavior, which becomes more evident at low
temperatures, leads to a local minimum in the overall mass flux.
Microscopically, this second transition results from the formation of a
double-layer of flowing particles in the confined nanotube space. These special
nano-fluidic features of core-softened particles closely resemble the enhanced
flow behavior observed for liquid water inside carbon nanotubes.

us our first hint at a mass-dependent spin distribution which would, in turn,
provide interesting constraints on models for SMBH growth. We also discuss the
recent discovery of relativistic X-ray reverberation which we can use to ""echo

imaging, calibrated using space-based CANDELS HST observations in the centre of

that quiescent galaxies at a given stellar mass were typically ~ 50 % smaller

passive galaxies in denser environments are on average significantly larger at

synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons accelerated at the GRB

speeds as it sweeps up the surrounding medium. We investigate the temporal
decay of the emission from GRB afterglows at late times, when the bulk of the
shock-accelerated electrons are non-relativistic. For a uniform circumburst

wave to the non-relativistic spherically-symmetric Sedov-Taylor solution, and
epsilon_e = 0.1 epsilon_{e,-1} quantifies the amount of shock energy
transferred to the post-shock electrons. For typical parameters, the deep
Newtonian stage starts ~ 0.5-several years after the GRB. The radio flux in
this phase decays as F_nu ~ t^{-3(p+1)/10}, with decay slope between -0.9 and
-1.2, for a power-law distribution of shock-accelerated electrons with index 2
< p < 3. This is shallower than the commonly assumed scaling F_nu ~
t^{-3(5p-7)/10} (with decay slope between -0.9 and -2.4) derived by Frail et
al. (2000), which only applies if the GRB shock is non-relativistic, but the
electron distribution still peaks at ultra-relativistic energies (a regime that
is relevant for a narrow time interval, and only if t_{DN} > t_{ST}, or
epsilon_e > 0.03). We discuss how the deep Newtonian phase can be reliably used

anomaly mediation generates sparticle soft masses proportional to the gravitino
mass. Recently, we showed that one-loop anomaly-mediated gaugino masses should
be associated with unbroken supersymmetry (SUSY). This counterintuitive result
arises because the underlying symmetry structure of (broken) SUGRA in flat
space is in fact (unbroken) SUSY in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. When quantum
corrections are regulated in a way that preserves SUGRA, the underlying AdS
curvature (proportional to the gravitino mass) necessarily appears in the
regulated action, yielding soft masses without corresponding goldstino
couplings. In this paper, we extend our analysis of anomaly mediation to
sfermion soft masses. Already at tree-level we encounter a number of surprises,
including the fact that zero soft masses correspond to broken (AdS) SUSY. At
one-loop, we explain how anomaly mediation appears when regulating SUGRA in a
way that preserves super-Weyl invariance. We find that recent claims in the
literature about the non-existence of anomaly mediation were based on a
Wilsonian effective action with residual gauge dependence, and the
gauge-invariant 1PI effective action contains the expected anomaly-mediated
spectrum. Finally, we calculate the sfermion spectrum to all orders, and use
supertrace relations to derive the familiar two-loop soft masses from minimal
anomaly mediation, as well as unfamiliar tree-level and one-loop goldstino
couplings consistent with renormalization group invariance.

phase transitions characterized by universal singularities do occur in the time
evolution of random spin chains. The sharpness of the transitions and integrity
of the phases owes to many-body localization, which prevents thermalization in
these systems. Using a renormalization group approach, we solve the time
evolution of random Ising spin chains with generic interactions starting from
initial states of arbitrary energy. As a function of the Hamiltonian
parameters, the system is tuned through a dynamical transition, similar to the
ground state critical point, at which the local spin correlations establish
true long range temporal order. In the state with dominant transverse field, a
spin that starts in an up state loses its orientation with time, while in the
""ordered"" state it never does. As in ground state quantum phase transitions,
the dynamical transition has unique signatures in the entanglement properties
of the system. When the system is initialized in a product state the
entanglement entropy grows as $log(t)$ in the two ""phases"", while at the

hyperfine interaction that leads to less dephasing from nuclear spins. Thus
many recent studies have suggested that nuclear spins are unimportant for hole
spin dynamics compared to electric field fluctuations. We show that the hole
hyperfine interaction can have a strong effect on hole spin coherence
measurements through a nuclear feedback effect. The nuclear polarization is
generated through a unique process that is dependent on the anisotropy of the
hole hyperfine interaction and the coherent precession of nuclear spins, giving
rise to strong modulation at the nuclear precession frequency.

Only 20 of these 58 candidates were detected in the ROSAT All-Sky X-ray Survey

active nearby, young stars, particularly for stars of type M4 and later. Based
on statistical analysis of the kinematics and/or spectroscopic followup of
these 58 M stars, we find that 50% (29 stars) indeed have properties consistent
with Tuc-Hor membership, while 12 are potential new members of the Columba
Association, and two may be AB Dor moving group members. Hence, ~75% of our
initial subsample of 58 candidates are likely members of young (age ~10-40 Myr)
stellar moving groups within 100 pc, verifying that the stellar color- and

inductive types that we developed previously. That is, we present a sound
coinduction rule for any data type arising as the carrier of the final
coalgebra of a functor, thus relaxing Hermida and Jacobs' restriction to
polynomial functors. To achieve this we introduce the notion of a quotient
category with equality (QCE) that i) abstracts the standard notion of a
fibration of relations constructed from a given fibration; and ii) plays a role
in the theory of coinduction dual to that played by a comprehension category
with unit (CCU) in the theory of induction. Secondly, we show that inductive
and coinductive indexed types also admit sound induction and coinduction rules.
Indexed data types often arise as carriers of initial algebras and final
coalgebras of functors on slice categories, so we give sufficient conditions
under which we can construct, from a CCU (QCE) U:E \rightarrow B, a fibration
with base B/I that models indexing by I and is also a CCU (resp., QCE). We
finish the paper by considering the more general case of sound induction and
coinduction rules for indexed data types when the indexing is itself given by a
fibration.

close. This article reviews the dynamical processes by which stars or stellar
remnants are placed onto loss-cone orbits and the implications for feeding
rates. The capture rate is well defined for spherical galaxies with nuclear
relaxation times that are shorter than the galaxy's age. However, even the
dense nucleus of the Milky Way may be less than one relaxation time old, and
this is certainly the case for more massive galaxies; the capture rate in such
galaxies is an initial-value problem with poorly-known initial conditions and
the rate can be much higher, or much lower, than the rate in a collisionally
relaxed nucleus. In nonspherical (axisymmetric, triaxial) galaxies, torquing of
orbits by the mean field can dominate perturbations due to random encounters,
leading to much higher capture rates than in the spherical geometry,
particularly in (massive) galaxies with long central relaxation times.
Relativistic precession plays a crucial role in mediating the capture of
compact remnants from regions very near to the black hole, by destroying the
orbital correlations that would otherwise dominate the torques. The complex
dynamics of relativistic loss cones are not yet well enough understood for
accurate estimates of compact-object (EMRI) capture rates to be made.

at a certain scale in arbitrary dimensions, but the sheer size of these
complexes limits their practical impact. While recent work introduced
approximation techniques for filtrations of (Vietoris-)Rips complexes, a
coarser version of \v{C}ech complexes, we propose the approximation of \v{C}ech
filtrations directly.
  For fixed dimensional point set $S$, we present an approximation of the
\v{C}ech filtration of $S$ by a sequence of complexes of size linear in the
number of points. We generalize well-separated pair decompositions (WSPD) to
well-separated simplicial decomposition (WSSD) in which every simplex defined
on $S$ is covered by some element of WSSD. We give an efficient algorithm to
compute a linear-sized WSSD in fixed dimensional spaces. Using a WSSD, we then
present a linear-sized approximation of the filtration of \v{C}ech complex of
$S$.
  We also present a generalization of the known fact that the Rips complex
approximates the \v{C}ech complex by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$. We define a class
of complexes that interpolate between \v{C}ech and Rips complexes and that,
given any parameter $\eps > 0$, approximate the \v{C}ech complex by a factor
$(1+\eps)$. Our complex can be represented by roughly $O(n^{\lceil

dimension of the point set. Our results are based on an interesting link
between \v{C}ech complex and coresets for minimum enclosing ball of

formation by comparing spectrum calculations using full 3D atmosphere
structures with those from <3D> averages. We explore methods for computing mean
<3D> stratifications from the Stagger-grid time-dependent 3D radiative hydro-
dynamical atmosphere models by considering four different reference depth
scales (geometrical depth, column-mass density, and two optical depth scales).
Furthermore, we investigate the influence of alternative averages (logarithmic
or enforced hydrostatic equilibrium, flux-weighted temperatures). For the line
formation we compute curves of growth for Fe i and Fe ii lines in LTE . The
resulting <3D> stratifications for the four reference depth scales can be
considerably different. We find typically that in the upper atmosphere and in
the superadiabatic region just below the optical surface, where the temperature
and density fluctuations are highest, the differences become considerable and
increase for higher Teff, lower logg, and lower [Fe/H]. The differential
comparison of spectral line formation shows distinctive differences depending
on which <3D> model is applied. The averages over layers of constant
column-mass density yield the best mean <3D> representation for LTE line
formation, while the averages on layers at constant geometrical height are the
least appropriate. Unexpectedly, the usually preferred averages over layers of
constant optical depth are prone to the increasing interference of the reversed
granulation towards higher effective temperature, in particular at low
metallicity.

behaviour which can be understood through the semiclassical approximation.
Within the approximation, transport moments reduce to codifying classical
correlations between scattering trajectories. These can be represented as
ribbon graphs and we develop an algorithmic combinatorial method to generate
all such graphs with a given genus. This provides an expansion of the linear
transport moments for systems both with and without time reversal symmetry. The
computational implementation is then able to progress several orders higher
than previous semiclassical formulae as well as those derived from an
asymptotic expansion of random matrix results. The patterns observed also
suggest a general form for the higher orders.

analytical solution. Furthermore, any attempt to approximate it using numerical
or simulation based approaches require a priori access to the true states,

hidden or unmeasured, a new approach based on sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC) or
particle filters (PF) is proposed. The approach uses SMC methods to estimate
the hidden states using a sequence of the available sensor measurements. The

right webpages is critical because any mismatched ads would not only harm web
users' satisfactions but also lower the ad income. In this paper, we study how
online publishers could optimally select ads to maximize their ad incomes over
time. The conventional offline, content-based matching between webpages and ads
is a fine start but cannot solve the problem completely because good matching
does not necessarily lead to good payoff. Moreover, with the limited display
impressions, we need to balance the need of selecting ads to learn true ad
payoffs (exploration) with that of allocating ads to generate high immediate
payoffs based on the current belief (exploitation). In this paper, we address
the problem by employing Partially observable Markov decision processes
(POMDPs) and discuss how to utilize the correlation of ads to improve the
efficiency of the exploration and increase ad incomes in a long run. Our
mathematical derivation shows that the belief states of correlated ads can be
naturally updated using a formula similar to collaborative filtering. To test
our model, a real world ad dataset from a major search engine is collected and
categorized. Experimenting over the data, we provide an analyse of the effect
of the underlying parameters, and demonstrate that our algorithms significantly

(ALPT) to generate a dark matter density field on a mesh starting from Gaussian

combination of second order LPT (2LPT) on large scales and the spherical
collapse model on smaller scales. We account for the systematic deviation of
perturbative approaches from N-body simulations together with halo biasing
adopting an exponential bias model. We then account for stochastic biasing by
defining three regimes: a low, an intermediate and a high density regime, using
a Poisson distribution in the intermediate regime and the negative binomial
distribution to model over-dispersion in the high density regime. Since we
focus in this study on massive halos, we suppress the generation of halos in
the low density regime. The various nonlinear and stochastic biasing
parameters, and density thresholds (five) are calibrated with the large
BigMultiDark N-body simulation to match the power spectrum of the corresponding
halo population. Our mock catalogues show power spectra, both in real- and
redshift-space, which are compatible with N-body simulations within about 2% up
to k ~ 1 h Mpc^-1 at z = 0.577 for a sample of halos with the typical BOSS
CMASS galaxy number density. The corresponding correlation functions are
compatible down to a few Mpc. We also find that neglecting over-dispersion in

white Gaussian noise broadcast channel (AWGN-BC) with noiseless feedback in the
literature. The achievable rate regions of these schemes go well beyond the
capacity region of the AWGN-BC without feedback. In this paper, a concatenating
coding design for the $K$-user AWGN-BC with noisy feedback is proposed that
relies on linear feedback schemes to achieve rate tuples outside the
no-feedback capacity region. Specifically, a linear feedback code for the
AWGN-BC with noisy feedback is used as an inner code that creates an effective
single-user channel from the transmitter to each of the receivers, and then
open-loop coding is used for coding over these single-user channels. An
achievable rate region of linear feedback schemes for noiseless feedback is
shown to be achievable by the concatenated coding scheme for sufficiently small
feedback noise level. Then, a linear feedback coding scheme for the $K$-user
symmetric AWGN-BC with noisy feedback is presented and optimized for use in the
concatenated coding scheme. Lastly, we apply the concatenated coding design to
the two-user AWGN-BC with a single noisy feedback link from one of the
receivers.

it is critical to know the current location of any sensor node with the minimum
energy consumed. This paper focuses on the energy consumption issue in terms of
communication between nodes whenever the localization information is
transmitted to a sink node. Tracking through WSNs can be categorized into
centralized and decentralized systems. Decentralized systems offer low power
consumption when deployed to track a small number of mobile targets compared to
the centralized tracking systems. However, in several applications, it is
essential to position a large number of mobile targets. In such applications,
decentralized systems offer high power consumption, since the location of each
mobile target is required to be transmitted to a sink node, and this increases
the power consumption for the whole WSN. In this paper, we propose a power
efficient decentralized approach for tracking a large number of mobile targets
while offering reasonable localization accuracy through ZigBee network.

The results also become extremely sensitive to certain model parameters that

functions. 2. If $f$ is fractionally subadditive (XOS) it is $\epsilon$-close
to a function of $2^{O(1/\epsilon^2)}$ variables. This result holds for all
functions with low total $\ell_1$-influence and is a real-valued analogue of
Friedgut's theorem for boolean functions. We show that $2^{\Omega(1/\epsilon)}$
variables are necessary even for XOS functions.
  As applications of these results, we provide learning algorithms over the
uniform distribution. For XOS functions, we give a PAC learning algorithm that
runs in time $2^{poly(1/\epsilon)} poly(n)$. For submodular functions we give
an algorithm in the more demanding PMAC learning model (Balcan and Harvey,
2011) which requires a multiplicative $1+\gamma$ factor approximation with
probability at least $1-\epsilon$ over the target distribution. Our uniform
distribution algorithm runs in time $2^{poly(1/(\gamma\epsilon))} poly(n)$.
This is the first algorithm in the PMAC model that over the uniform
distribution can achieve a constant approximation factor arbitrarily close to 1
for all submodular functions. As follows from the lower bounds in (Feldman et
al., 2013) both of these algorithms are close to optimal. We also give
applications for proper learning, testing and agnostic learning with value
queries of these classes.

are built on the assumption that sub-grid cell transport is Fickian such that
dispersive spreading around the average velocity is symmetric and without
significant tailing on the front edge of a solute plume. However, anomalous
diffusion in the form of super-diffusion due to preferential pathways in an
aquifer has been observed in field data, challenging the assumption of Fickian
dispersion at the local scale. This study develops a fully Lagrangian method to
simulate sub-grid super-diffusion in a multi-dimensional regional-scale
transport. The underlying concept is based on previous observations that
solutions to space-fractional ADEs, which can describe super-diffusive
dispersion, can be obtained by transforming solutions of classical ADEs. The
transformations are equivalent to randomizing particle travel time or relative
velocity for each model time step. Here, the time randomizing procedure known
as subordination is applied to flow field output from MODFLOW simulations.
Numerical tests check the applicability of the novel method in mapping
regional-scale super-diffusive transport conditioned on local properties of
multi-dimensional heterogeneous media.

steep rise at wavelengths shorter than 3000 {\AA}, but no significant reddening
at longer wavelengths. The absence of dust reddening in optical continuum is
confirmed by the normal broad-line Balmer decrement (the H$\alpha$/H$\beta$
ratio) in IRAS 14026+4341. The anomalous reddening curve can be satisfactorily
reproduced by a dust model containing silicate grains in a power-law size
distribution, $dn(a)/da \propto a^{-1.4}$, truncated at a maximum size
$a_{max}=70 {\rm nm}$. The unusual size distribution may be caused by the
destruction of large ""stardust"" grains by quasar activities or a different dust
formation mechanism (i.e., the in situ formation of dust grains in quasar
outflows). It is also possible that the analogies of the dust grains observed
toward the Galactic center is responsible for the steep reddening curve. In
addition, we find that IRAS 14026+4341 is a weak emission-line quasar (i.e.,
PHL 1811 analogies) with heavy dust reddening and blueshifted broad absorption

this object contains 31 epochs spread over 2.5 years. Our Keplerian fit using a
Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, reveals that the companion has an orbital
period of $90.2695^{+0.0188}_{-0.0187}$ days, an eccentricity of $0.4375 \pm
0.0040$ and a semi-amplitude of $2948.14^{+16.65}_{-16.55}$ m s$^{-1}$. Using
additional high-resolution spectroscopy, we find the host star has an effective
temperature $T_{\rm{eff}}=6004 \pm 34$ K, a surface gravity $\log g$ [cgs]
$=4.55 \pm 0.17$ and a metallicity [Fe/H] $=+0.04 \pm 0.06$. The stellar mass
and radius determined through the empirical relationship of Torres et al.

minimum mass of MARVELS-5b is $65.0 \pm 2.9 M_{Jup}$, indicating that it is
likely to be either a brown dwarf or a very low mass star, thus occupying a
relatively sparsely-populated region of the mass function of companions to
solar-type stars. The distance to this system is 101$\pm$10 pc from the

echoing of a strong ultraviolet to soft X-ray flare caused by tidal disruption

broad lines in three of the objects, which disappeared in the MMT spectra in

Previous numerical work focused on the simplified scenario in which shocked

both the clump and the ambient medium. Here we consider the complementary
circumstance in which the field is completely self-contained within the clumps.
This could arise naturally during clump formation via dynamical or thermal
instabilities for example as magnetic field pinches off from the ambient
medium. Using our AMR MHD code AstroBEAR, we carry out a series of simulations
with magnetized clumps that have different self-contained magnetic field
configurations. We find that the clump and magnetic evolution are sensitive to
the fraction of magnetic field aligned with versus perpendicular to the shock
normal. The relative strength of magnetic pressure and tension in the different
field configurations allows us to analytically understand the different cases
of post-shock evolution. We also show how turbulence and the mixing it implies
depends of the initial field configuration and suggest ways in which observed
shock-clump morphology may be used as a proxy for identifying internal field

  count","accepted for publication in ApJ",,"10.1088/0004-637X/790/1/7",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study how to measure the galaxy merger rate from the observed close pair
count. Using a high-resolution N-body/SPH cosmological simulation, we find an
accurate scaling relation between galaxy pair counts and merger rates down to a
stellar mass ratio of about 1:30. The relation explicitly accounts for the
dependence on redshift (or time), on pair separation, and on mass of the two
galaxies in a pair. With this relation, one can easily obtain the mean merger
timescale for a close pair of galaxies. The use of virial masses, instead of
stellar masses, is motivated by the fact that the dynamical friction time scale
is mainly determined by the dark matter surrounding central and satellite
galaxies. This fact can also minimize the error induced by uncertainties in
modeling star formation in the simulation. Since the virial mass can be read
from the well-established relation between the virial masses and the stellar
masses in observation, our scaling relation can be easily applied to
observations to obtain the merger rate and merger time scale. For major merger
pairs (1:1-1:4) of galaxies above a stellar mass of 4*10^10 M_sun/h at z=0.1,
it takes about 0.31 Gyr to merge for pairs within a projected distance of 20
kpc/h with stellar mass ratio of 1:1, while the time taken goes up to 1.6 Gyr
for mergers with stellar mass ratio of 1:4. Our results indicate that a single
timescale usually used in literature is not accurate to describe mergers with
the stellar mass ratio spanning even a narrow range from 1:1 to 1:4.

Although design science research in information systems seems to be a prime

This position paper argues that this is due to the demand of justifying

of C&E research it is questionable if powerful actors grant access to their
organization and support projects which ultimately challenge their position. It
is suggested that theory development based on a synthesis of justificatory

an important role in generating shower partons in the intermediate \ppt\
region. Momentum degradation of the hard and semihard partons as they traverse
the inhomogeneous medium at various azimuthal angles results in a complicated
convolution of geometrical, nuclear and dynamical factors that cannot usually
be described in a transparent way. In this work a compact formula is found that
represents the inclusive distributions of minijets of any parton type at the
surface of the medium for any collision centrality. They take into account the
contributions from all initiating partons created at any point in the medium.
By comparing with the case of no energy loss, a ratio has been determined that
is analogous to the nuclear modification factor for minijets. Phenomenological
reality of such distributions is examined by calculating the hadronization of
the minijets in the recombination model. Good fits of the data on pion, kaon
and proton production throughout the intermediate \ppt\ region have been
obtained by adjusting the parameters controlling the magnitude of the thermal
partons and the degradation rates of the semihard partons. The result gives
support to the minijet spectra at any centrality on the one hand, and the
hadronization procedure used on the other. An important property made manifest
in this study is that quarks and gluons must not lose energy in the same way
because the partons form mesons and baryons differently by recombination and
the momenta of quarks and gluons must be degraded at different rates in order
to reproduce the experimental pion and proton spectra. This is a feature that
renders invalid the notion of parton-hadron duality or other hadronization
schemes based on similar ideas.

de-noising via link prediction (LP) could improve the learning accuracy. LP
uses the existing PIN topology to predict missing and spurious links. Many of
existing LP methods rely on shared immediate neighborhoods of the nodes to be
linked. As such, they have limitations. Thus, in order to comprehensively study
what are the topological properties of nodes in PINs that dictate whether the
nodes should be linked, we had to introduce novel sensitive LP measures that
overcome the limitations of the existing methods.
  We systematically evaluate the new and existing LP measures by introducing
""synthetic"" noise to PINs and measuring how well the different measures
reconstruct the original PINs. Our main findings are: 1) LP measures that favor
nodes which are both ""topologically similar"" and have large shared extended
neighborhoods are superior; 2) using more network topology often though not
always improves LP accuracy; and 3) our new LP measures are superior to the
existing measures. After evaluating the different methods, we use them to
de-noise PINs. Importantly, we manage to improve biological correctness of the
PINs by de-noising them, with respect to ""enrichment"" of the predicted

singular behavior of equilibrium densities at boundaries. In contrast to states
at integer filling fraction, such quantum liquids posses an additional dipole
moment localized near edges. It enters observable quantities such as universal
dispersion of edge states and Lorentz shear stress. For a Laughlin state, this
behavior is seen as a peak, or overshoot, in the single particle density near
the edge, reflecting a general tendency of electrons in FQH states to cluster
near edges. We compute the singular edge behavior of the one particle density
by a perturbative expansion carried out around a completely filled Landau
level. This correction is shown to fully capture the dipole moment and the
major features of the overshoot observed numerically. Furthermore, it exhibits
the Stokes phenomenon with the Stokes line at the boundary of the droplet,
decaying like a Gaussian inside and outside the liquid with different decay
lengths. In the limit of vanishing magnetic length the shape the overshoot is a
singular double layer with a capacity that is a universal function of the
filling fraction. Finally, we derive the edge dipole moment of Pfaffian FQH
states. The result suggests an explicit connection between the magnitude of the

development of DFT based methods that account for van der Waals (vdW)

improve the relative energies and transition pressures of the high-pressure ice
phases compared to those obtained with semi-local or hybrid xc functionals.
However, we also find that significant discrepancies between experiment and the
vdW inclusive approaches remain in the cohesive properties of the various
phases, causing certain phases to be absent from the phase diagram. Therefore,
room for improvement in the description of water at ambient and high pressures
remains and we suggest that because of the stern test the high pressure ice

flow to impair the correlation by delaying the packets or introducing dummy

  We introduce a game-theoretic framework for this problem, that is used to
derive the Nash Equilibrium. As obtaining the optimal adversary delays

Jahn-Teller (JT) distortion to oxygen-octahedron rotations in perovskite
LaMnO$_3$. The combination of the two distortions is responsible for
stabilizing the strongly orthorhombic $A$-AFM insulating ($I$) $Pbnm$ ground
state relative to a metallic ferromagnetic (FM-$M$) phase. However, epitaxial
strain due to coherent matching to a crystalline substrate can change the
relative stability of the two states. In particular, coherent matching to a
square-lattice substrate favors the less orthorhombic FM-$M$ phase, with the
$A$-AFM phase stabilized at higher values of tensile epitaxial strain due to
its larger volume per formula unit, resulting in a coupled magnetic and
metal-insulator transition at a critical strain close to 1%. At the phase
boundary, colossal magneto-resistance is expected. Tensile epitaxial strain
enhances the JT distortion and opens the band gap in the $A$-AFM-$I$ $c$-$Pbnm$
phase, offering the opportunity for band-gap engineering. Compressive epitaxial
strain induces an orientational transition within the FM-$M$ phase from
$c$-$Pbnm$ to $ab$-$Pbnm$ with a change in the direction of the magnetic easy
axis relative to the substrate, yielding strain-controlled magnetization at the
phase boundary. The strong couplings between the JT distortion, the
oxygen-octahedron rotations and the magnetic and electronic properties, and
associated functional behavior, motivate interest in other orthorhombic $Pbnm$
perovskites with large JT distortions, which should also exhibit a rich variety
of coupled magnetic, structural and electronic phase transitions driven by
epitaxial strain.

a planet and simultaneously be affected by non-gravitational effects. It is
possible to describe the secular variations of a particle orbit in the mean
motion resonance analytically using averaged resonant equations. We derive the
averaged resonant equations from the equations of motion in near-canonical
form. The secular variations of the particle orbit depending on the orientation
of the orbit in space are taken into account. The averaged resonant equations
can be derived/confirmed also from Lagrange's planetary equations. We apply the
derived theory to the case when the non-gravitational effects are the
Poynting--Robertson effect, the radial stellar wind, and an interstellar wind.
The analytical and numerical results obtained are in excellent agreement. We
found that the types of orbits correspond to libration centers of the
conservative problem. The averaged resonant equations can lead to a system of
equations which hold for stationary points in a subset of resonant variables.
Using this system we show analytically that for the considered
non-gravitational effects, all stationary points should correspond to orbits
which are stationary in interplanetary space after an averaging over a synodic
period. In an exact resonance, the stationary orbits are stable. The stability
is achieved by a periodic repetition of the evolution during the synodic
period. Numerical solutions of this system show that there are no stationary
orbits for either the exact or non-exact resonances.

tune the relative concentration of their targets to any desired value. We show
that this function is particularly effective when one of the targets is a
Transcription Factor (TF) which regulates the other targets. This combination
defines a new class of feed-forward loops (FFLs) in which the microRNA plays
the role of master regulator. Using both deterministic and stochastic equations
we show that these FFLs are indeed able not only to fine-tune the TF/target
ratio to any desired value as a function of the miRNA concentration but also,
thanks to the peculiar topology of the circuit, to ensures the stability of
this ratio against stochastic fluctuations. These two effects are due to the
interplay between the direct transcriptional regulation and the indirect
TF/Target interaction due to competition of TF and target for miRNA binding
(the so called ""sponge effect""). We then perform a genome wide search of these
FFLs in the human regulatory network and show that they are characterizedby a
very peculiar enrichment pattern. In particular they are strongly enriched in
all the situations in which the TF and its target have to be precisely kept at
the same concentration notwithstanding the environmental noise. As an example
we discuss the FFL involving E2F1 as Transcription Factor, RB1 as target and
miR-17 family as master regulator. These FFLs ensure a tight control of the
E2F/RB ratio which in turns ensures the stability of the transition from the
G0/G1 to the S phase in quiescent cells.

since its security may seem compromised by the linearity of its encoding

private-key encryption scheme in which a transmitter distributes the same
encoded measurements to receivers of different classes, which are provided
partially corrupted encoding matrices and are thus allowed to decode the
acquired signal at provably different levels of recovery quality.
  The security properties of this scheme are thoroughly analysed: firstly, the
properties of our multiclass encryption are theoretically investigated by
deriving performance bounds on the recovery quality attained by lower-class
receivers with respect to high-class ones. Then we perform a statistical
analysis of the measurements to show that, although not perfectly secure,
compressed sensing grants some level of security that comes at almost-zero cost
and thus may benefit resource-limited applications.
  In addition to this we report some exemplary applications of multiclass
encryption by compressed sensing of speech signals, electrocardiographic tracks
and images, in which quality degradation is quantified as the impossibility of

a broad range with minimum variation in the total output power is presented. It
is based on varying the diameter of a spatial filter inside the laser cavity.
The number of lasing modes supported by the degenerate laser can be controlled
from 1 to 320,000, with less than a 50% change in the total output power. We
show that a degenerate laser designed for low spatial coherence can be used as
an illumination source for speckle-free microscopy that is 9 orders of

  This purely canonical approach systematizes the series and leads to the
explicit expression for the Deprit generator in any perturbation order: \[G = -

pseudo-inverse of the perturbed Liouville operator. Corresponding Kato series
provides a reasonably effective computational algorithm.
  The canonical connection of perturbed and unperturbed averaging operators

mapping the parameter values onto experimentally measurable quantities can be

to find this unknown relation, by determining the unknown parameters of the
constrained minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (CMSSM) from
quantities that can be measured at the LHC. We expect that the method works
also for many other new physics models. We compare its performance with the
results of a straightforward \chi^2 minimization. We simulate LHC signals at a
center of mass energy of 14 TeV at the hadron level. In this proof-of-concept
study we do not explicitly simulate Standard Model backgrounds, but apply cuts
that have been shown to enhance the signal-to-background ratio. We analyze four
different benchmark points that lie just beyond current lower limits on
superparticle masses, each of which leads to around 1000 events after cuts for
an integrated luminosity of 10 fb^{-1}. We use up to 84 observables, most of
which are counting observables; we do not attempt to directly reconstruct
(differences of) masses from kinematic edges or kinks of distributions. We
nevertheless find that m_0 and m_{1/2} can be determined reliably, with errors
as small as 1% in some cases. With 500 fb^{-1} of data tan\beta as well as A_0

smaller amount of short-time damage and shorter time available for damage

aging gains importance. Analyses of gene expression or sequence data, which
have been indispensable for investigating aging, have been limited to studying
genes and their protein products in isolation, ignoring their connectivities.
However, proteins function by interacting with other proteins, and this is
exactly what biological networks (BNs) model. Thus, analyzing the proteins' BN
topologies could contribute to understanding of aging. Current methods for
analyzing systems-level BNs deal with their static representations, even though
cells are dynamic. For this reason, and because different data types can give
complementary biological insights, we integrate current static BNs with
aging-related gene expression data to construct dynamic, age-specific BNs.
Then, we apply sensitive measures of topology to the dynamic BNs to study
cellular changes with age.
  Results: While global BN topologies do not significantly change with age,
local topologies of a number of genes do. We predict such genes as
aging-related. We demonstrate credibility of our predictions by: 1) observing
significant overlap between our predicted aging-related genes and ""ground
truth"" aging-related genes; 2) showing that our aging-related predictions group
by functions and diseases that are different than functions and diseases of
genes that are not predicted as aging-related; 3) observing significant overlap
between functions and diseases that are enriched in our aging-related
predictions and those that are enriched in ""ground truth"" aging-related data;
4) providing evidence that diseases which are enriched in our aging-related
predictions are linked to human aging; and 5) validating all of our
high-scoring novel predictions via manual literature search.

The forest in this region is dominated by a combination of absorption due to
resonant Ly$\alpha$ and Ly$\beta$ scattering. When considering the 1D Ly$\beta$
forest in addition to the 1D Ly$\alpha$ forest, the full statistical
description of the data requires four 1D power spectra: Ly$\alpha$ and
Ly$\beta$ auto-power spectra and the Ly$\alpha$-Ly$\beta$ real and imaginary
cross-power spectra. We describe how these can be measured using an optimal
quadratic estimator that naturally disentangles Ly$\alpha$ and Ly$\beta$
contributions. Using a sample of approximately 60,000 quasar sight-lines from
the BOSS Data Release 9, we make the measurement of the one-dimensional power
spectrum of fluctuations due to the Ly$\beta$ resonant scattering. While we
have not corrected our measurements for resolution damping of the power and
other systematic effects carefully enough to use them for cosmological
constraints, we can robustly conclude the following: i) Ly$\beta$ power
spectrum and Ly$\alpha$-Ly$\beta$ cross spectra are detected with high
statistical significance; ii) the cross-correlation coefficient is $\approx 1$
on large scales; iii) the Ly$\beta$ measurements are contaminated by the
associated OVI absorption, which is analogous to the SiIII contamination of the
Ly$\alpha$ forest. Measurements of the Ly$\beta$ forest will allow extension of
the usable path-length for the Ly$\alpha$ measurements while allowing a better
understanding of the physics of intergalactic medium and thus more robust
cosmological constraints.

clouds. In a previous paper, we analysed the kinematical properties of the

now report on a search for new kinematical candidate members to the Chamaeleon
I and II moving groups using available information from public databases and
catalogues. Our candidates were initially selected in an area of 3 deg around
each cloud on the basis of proper motions and colours from the UCAC4 Catalog.
The SEDs of the objects were constructed using photometry retrieved from the
Virtual Observatory and other resources, and fitted to models of stellar
photospheres to derive effective temperatures, gravity values, and
luminosities. Masses and ages were estimated by comparison with theoretical
evolutionary tracks in a Hertzprung-Russell diagram. We have identified 51 and
14 candidate members to the Chamaeleon I and II moving groups, respectively, of
which 17 and 1, respectively, are classified as probable young stars (ages < 20
Myr) according to our analysis. Another object in Chamaeleon I located slightly
above the 1 Myr isochrone is classified as a possible young star. All these
objects are diskless stars with masses in the range 0.3M-1.4MSun, and ages
consistent with those reported for the corresponding confirmed members. They
tend to be located at the boundaries of or outside the dark clouds, preferably
to the north-east and south-east in the case of Chamaeleon I, and to the
north-east in the case of Chamaeleon II. We conclude that the kinematical
population of Chamaeleon I and II could be larger and spread over a larger area

functions: parton distribution functions which reflect the quark structure of
initial-state hadrons and collinear fragmentation functions which encode
details on the hadronization process. In the last decades, a major effort has
been achieved on theoretical and experimental levels and allowed to constraint,
with very high precision, parton distribution functions except strange quark
distribution, which still carries large uncertainties. Fragmentation functions,
however, remain at a very preliminary stage of study with a growing interest in
a more accurate and precise knowledge. Nowadays, while pion fragmentation
functions are known with a limited precision and kaon fragmentation functions

resolving emission from molecules in circumstellar disks. With an understanding
of physical conditions under which molecules have high abundance, they can be
used as direct tracers of distinct physical regions. In particular, DCO+ is
expected to have an enhanced abundance within a few Kelvin of the CO freezeout
temperature of 19 K, making it a useful probe of the cold disk midplane. We
compare ALMA line observations of HD 163296 to a grid of models. We vary the
upper- and lower-limit temperatures of the region in which DCO+ is present as
well as the abundance of DCO+ in order to fit channel maps of the DCO+ J=5-4
line. To determine the abundance enhancement compared to the general
interstellar medium, we carry out similar fitting to HCO+ J=4-3 and H13CO+
J=4-3 observations. ALMA images show centrally peaked extended emission from
HCO+ and H13CO+. DCO+ emission lies in a resolved ring from ~110 to 160 AU. The
outer radius approximately corresponds to the size of the CO snowline as
measured by previous lower resolution observations of CO lines in this disk.
The ALMA DCO+ data now resolve and image the CO snowline directly. In the best
fitting models, HCO+ exists in a region extending from the 19 K isotherm to the
photodissociation layer with an abundance of 3x10^-10 relative to H2. DCO+
exists within the 19-21 K region of the disk with an abundance ratio [DCO+] /
[HCO+] = 0.3. This represents a factor of 10^4 enhancement of the DCO+
abundance within this narrow region of the HD 163296 disk. Such a high
enhancement has only previously been seen in prestellar cores. The inferred
abundances provide a lower limit to the ionization fraction in the midplane of
the cold outer disk (approximately greater than 4x10^-10), and suggest the
utility of DCO+ as a tracer of its parent molecule H2D+. Abridged

of the boundary and also on the atomic configuration inside. At the low energy,
the boundary is either insulating or highly transparent depending on the
structure. In insulating cases, the transmission sharply rises when the Fermi
energy is increased to a certain level, suggesting that the electric current
through the boundary can be controlled by the field effect. The boundary
parallel to the zigzag direction generally have different transmission
properties between the two different valleys, and this enables to generate the

baseline configurations and wide field-of-views, inducing a w-modulation of the
sky image, which in turn induces the spread spectrum effect. We revisit the
impact of this effect on imaging quality and study a new algorithmic strategy
to deal with the associated operator in the image reconstruction process. In
previous studies it has been shown that image recovery in the framework of
compressed sensing is improved due to the spread spectrum effect, where the
w-modulation can act to increase the incoherence between measurement and
sparsifying signal representations. For the purpose of computational
efficiency, idealised experiments were performed, where only a constant
baseline component w in the pointing direction of the telescope was considered.
We extend this analysis to the more realistic setting where the w-component
varies for each visibility measurement. Firstly, incorporating varying
w-components into imaging algorithms is a computational demanding task. We
propose a variant of the w-projection algorithm for this purpose, which is
based on an adaptive sparsification procedure, and incorporate it in compressed
sensing imaging methods. This sparse matrix variant of the w-projection
algorithm is generic and adapts to the support of each kernel. Consequently, it
is applicable for all types of direction-dependent effects. Secondly, we show
that for w-modulation with varying w-components, reconstruction quality is
significantly improved compared to the setting where there is no w-modulation
(i.e. w=0), reaching levels comparable to the quality of a constant, maximal
w-component. This finding confirms that one may seek to optimise future
telescope configurations to promote large w-components, thus enhancing the
spread spectrum effect and consequently the fidelity of image reconstruction.

the acceleration decreases linearly with the logarithm of the SRM speed. We

essential for self-propelled motion of the droplet at low Reynolds' number.
Therefore, this calculation describes a simple mechanism for the motility of a

Condition (NC) holds given some set of background information, and fails to
hold against others, but rarely go any further. That is, it is usually not
explored which background information makes NC true or false. The present paper
aims to fill this gap. For us, ""(objective) background knowledge"" is restricted
to information that can be expressed as probability events. Any other
configuration is regarded as being subjective and a property of the a priori
probability distribution. We study NC in two specific settings. In the first
case, a complete description of some individuals is known, e.g. one knows of
each of a group of individuals whether they are black and whether they are
ravens. In the second case, the number of individuals having a particular
property is given, e.g. one knows how many ravens or how many black things
there are (in the relevant population). While some of the most famous answers
to the paradox are measure-dependent, our discussion is not restricted to any
particular probability measure. Our most interesting result is that in the
second setting, NC violates a simple kind of inductive inference (namely
projectability). Since relative to NC, this latter rule is more closely related
to, and more directly justified by our intuitive notion of inductive reasoning,
this tension makes a case against the plausibility of NC. In the end, we
suggest that the informal representation of NC may seem to be intuitively
plausible because it can easily be mistaken for reasoning by analogy.

  Parasite Interface",,,,,"q-bio.BM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Plasmodium falciparum 70 kDa heat shock proteins (PfHsp70s) are expressed at
all stages of the pathogenic erythrocytic phase of the malaria parasite
lifecycle. There are six PfHsp70s, all of which have orthologues in other
plasmodial species, except for PfHsp70-x which is unique to P. falciparum. This
paper highlights a number of original results obtained by a detailed
bioinformatics analysis of the protein. Large scale sequence analysis indicated
the presence of an extended transit peptide sequence of PfHsp70-x which
potentially directs it to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Further analysis
showed that PfHsp70-x does not have an ER-retention sequence, suggesting that
the protein transits through the ER and is secreted into the parasitophorous
vacuole (PV) or beyond into the erythrocyte cytosol. These results are
consistent with experimental findings. Next, possible interactions between
PfHsp70-x and exported P. falciparum Hsp40s or host erythrocyte DnaJs were
interrogated by modeling and docking. Docking results indicated that
interaction between PfHsp70-x and each of the Hsp40s, regardless of biological
feasibility, seems equally likely. This suggests that J domain might not
provide the specificity in the formation of unique Hsp70-Hsp40 complexes, but
that the specificity might be provided by other domains of Hsp40s. By studying
different structural conformations of PfHsp70-x, it was shown that Hsp40s can
only bind when PfHsp70-x is in a certain conformation. Additionally, this work
highlighted the possible dependence of the substrate binding domain residues on
the orientation of the {\alpha}-helical lid for formation of the substrate
binding pocket.

  Janeiro, Brazil, July 2013",,,,"astro-ph.IM astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the current view of Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) phenomena, an emission component
extending up to the very-high energy (VHE, E > 30 GeV) domain is though to be a
relatively common feature at least in the brightest events. This leads to an
unexpected richness of possible theoretical models able to describe such
phenomenology. Hints of emission at tens of GeV are indeed known since the
EGRET observations during the '90s and confirmed in the Fermi-LAT data.
However, our comprehension of these phenomena is still far to be satisfactory.
In this respect, the VHE characterization of GRBs may constitute a breakthrough
for understanding their physics and, possibly, for providing decisive clues for
the discrimination among different proposed emission mechanisms, which are
barely distinguishable at lower energies. The current generation of Cherenkov
observatories, such as the MAGIC telescopes, have opened the possibility to
extend the measurement of GRB emission, and in general to any short time-scale
transient phenomena, fromfew tens of GeV up to the TeV energy range, with a
higher sensitivity with respect to gamma-ray space-based instruments. In the
near future, a crucial role for the VHE observations of GRBs will be played by
the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), thanks to its about one order of magnitude
better sensitivity and lower energy threshold with respect to current
instruments. In this contribution, we present a method aimed at providing VHE
detection prospects for observations of GRB-like transient events with
Cherenkov telescopes. In particular, we consider the observation of the
transient event GRB 090102 as a test case for the method and show the achieved
detection prospects under different observational conditions for the MAGIC

probabilistic prediction of M > 5.5 events in Italy . In this study we analyze
both some aspects of the statistical estimation of the model and its predictive
ability. We find that more or less effective prediction is possible within 4
out of 34 seismotectonic zones where seismicity rate or clustering of events is
relatively high. We show that, in the framework of the model, one can suggest a
simple zone independent strategy, which practically optimizes the relative
number of nonaccidental successes, or the Hanssen-Kuiper, HK, skill score. This
quasi-optimal strategy declares alarm in a zone for the first 2.67 years just
after the occurrence of each large event in the zone. The optimal HK skill
score values are: 26% for the 3 most active zones and 2-10% for the 26 least
active zones. However, the number of false alarm time intervals per one event
in each of the zones is unusually high: 0.7 and 0.8-0.95 respectively. Both
these theoretical estimations are important because any prospective testing of
the model is unrealistic in most of the zones during a reasonable time. This
particular analysis requires a discussion of the following issues of general
interest: a specific approach to the analysis of predictions vs. the standard
CSEP testing approach; prediction vs. forecasting; HK skill score vs.
probability gain; the total forecast error diagram and connected false alarms.

deriving kinetic equations to dissipative many-body systems. The basic
conjecture underlying the Bogolyubov approach is the functional hypothesis,
according to which, the many-particle distribution functions are assumed to be
functionals of the one-particle distribution function on kinetic time scales.
Another ingredient in the Bogolyubov approach is the principle of the spatial
weakening of correlations, which reflects statistical independence of physical
values at distant spatial points. One can consider it as a reasonable mixing
property of many-particle distribution functions. The motivation behind the
generalization of Bogolyubov's approach to (classical) many-body dissipative
systems is the wish to describe the dynamics of granular systems, in particular
granular fluids. To this end we first define a general dissipative fluid
through a dissipation function, thereby generalizing the commonly employed
models for granular fluids. Using the Bogolyubov functional hypothesis we show
how a reduction of the pertinent BBGKY hierarchy can be achieved. The method is
then employed to cases which can be treated perturbatively, such as those in
which the interactions are weak or the dissipation is small or the particle
density is small. Kinetic descriptions are obtained in all of these limiting
cases. As a test case, we show that the Bogolyubov method begets the now
standard inelastic Boltzmann equation for dilute monodisperse collections of
spheres whose collisions are characterized by a fixed coefficient of normal
restitution. Possible further applications and implications are discussed.

microwave signals is an ubiquitous technological challenge, crucial in fields
as diverse as radio astronomy, medical imaging, navigation and communication,
including those of quantum states. Efficient upconversion of rf-signals to an
optical carrier would allow transmitting them via optical fibers dramatically
reducing losses, and give access to the mature toolbox of quantum optical
techniques, routinely enabling quantum-limited signal detection. Research in
the field of cavity optomechanics has shown that nanomechanical oscillators can
couple very strongly to either microwave or optical fields. An oscillator
accommodating both functionalities would bear great promise as the intermediate
platform in a radio-to-optical transduction cascade. Here, we demonstrate such
an opto-electro-mechanical transducer utilizing a high-Q nanomembrane. A
moderate voltage bias (<10V) is sufficient to induce strong coupling between
the voltage fluctuations in a rf resonance circuit and the membrane's
displacement, which is simultaneously coupled to light reflected off its
metallized surface. The circuit acts as an antenna; the voltage signals it
induces are detected as an optical phase shift with quantum-limited
sensitivity. The half-wave voltage is in the microvolt range, orders of
magnitude below that of standard optical modulators. The noise added by the
membrane is suppressed by the electro-mechanical cooperativity C~6800 and has a
temperature of 40mK, far below 300K where the entire device is operated. This
corresponds to a sensitivity limit as low as 5 pV/Hz^1/2, or -210dBm/Hz in a
narrow band around 1 MHz. Our work introduces an entirely new approach to
all-optical, ultralow-noise detection of classical electronic signals, and sets
the stage for coherent upconversion of low-frequency quantum signals to the
optical domain.

Phase separation in superconducting KFS crystals is realized via naturally

ordered $n$-type semiconducting regions, sandwiched between Fe-vacancy free SC

structure of those active layer is tuned to induce Cooper pairs by the
proximity effect [de Gennes] and/or to accept Cooper pair tunneling from the SC

features in the potential (and sound speed) of the inflaton field, in the
context of the Effective Field Theory of Inflation. This approach allows us to
study the effects of features in the power-spectrum and in the bispectrum of
curvature perturbations, from a model-independent point of view, by
parametrizing the features directly with modified ""slow-roll"" parameters. We
can obtain a self-consistent power-spectrum, together with enhanced
non-Gaussianity, which grows with a quantity $\beta$ that parametrizes the
sharpness of the step. With this treatment it is straightforward to generalize
and include features in other coefficients of the effective action of the
inflaton field fluctuations. Our conclusion in this case is that, excluding
extrinsic curvature terms, the only interesting effects at the level of the
bispectrum could arise from features in the first slow-roll parameter
$\epsilon$ or in the speed of sound $c_s$. Finally, we derive an upper bound on
the parameter $\beta$ from the consistency of the perturbative expansion of the
action for inflaton perturbations. This constraint can be used for an
estimation of the signal-to-noise ratio, to show that the observable which is
most sensitive to features is the power-spectrum. This conclusion would change
if we consider the contemporary presence of a feature and a speed of sound $c_s
< 1$, as, in such a case, contributions from an oscillating folded
configuration can potentially make the bispectrum the leading observable for
feature models.

Obtaining a theoretical solution to the simultaneous state-parameter estimation
problem for non-linear stochastic systems involves solving complex
multi-dimensional integrals that are not amenable to analytical solution. While
basic sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC) or particle filtering (PF) algorithms for
simultaneous estimation exist, it is well recognized that there is a need for
making these on-line algorithms non-degenerate, fast and applicable to
processes with missing measurements. To overcome the deficiencies in
traditional algorithms, this work proposes a Bayesian approach to on-line state
and parameter estimation. Its extension to handle missing data in real-time is
also provided. The simultaneous estimation is performed by filtering an
extended vector of states and parameters using an adaptive
sequential-importance-resampling (SIR) filter with a kernel density estimation
method. The approach uses an on-line optimization algorithm based on
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to allow adaptation of the SIR filter for
combined state-parameter estimation. An optimal tuning rule to control the
width of the kernel and the variance of the artificial noise added to the
parameters is also proposed. The approach is illustrated through numerical
examples.

the Anderson impurity model, in the extreme correlation limit. We develop an
expansion in a parameter \lambda, related to n_d, the average occupation of the
localized orbital, and find analytic expressions for the Green's functions to
O(\lambda^2). These yield the impurity spectral function and also the
self-energy \Sigma(\omega) in terms of the two self energies of the ECFL
formalism. The imaginary parts of the latter, have roughly symmetric low energy
behaviour (~ \omega^2), as predicted by Fermi Liquid theory. However, the
inferred impurity self energy
  \Sigma""(\omega) develops asymmetric corrections near n_d ~ 1, leading in turn
to a strongly asymmetric impurity spectral function with a skew towards the
occupied states. Within this approximation the Friedel sum rule is satisfied
but we overestimate the quasiparticle weight z relative to the known exact
results, resulting in an over broadening of the Kondo peak. Upon scaling the
frequency by the quasiparticle weight z, the spectrum is found to be in
reasonable agreement with numerical renormalization group results over a wide

  detection in primary visual cortex",,,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many approaches for multiple testing begin with the assumption that all tests
in a given study should be combined into a global false-discovery-rate
analysis. But this may be inappropriate for many of today's large-scale
screening problems, where auxiliary information about each test is often
available, and where a combined analysis can lead to poorly calibrated error
rates within different subsets of the experiment. To address this issue, we
introduce an approach called false-discovery-rate regression that directly uses
this auxiliary information to inform the outcome of each test. The method can
be motivated by a two-groups model in which covariates are allowed to influence
the local false discovery rate, or equivalently, the posterior probability that
a given observation is a signal. This poses many subtle issues at the interface
between inference and computation, and we investigate several variations of the
overall approach. Simulation evidence suggests that: (1) when covariate effects
are present, FDR regression improves power for a fixed false-discovery rate;
and (2) when covariate effects are absent, the method is robust, in the sense
that it does not lead to inflated error rates. We apply the method to neural
recordings from primary visual cortex. The goal is to detect pairs of neurons
that exhibit fine-time-scale interactions, in the sense that they fire together
more often than expected due to chance. Our method detects roughly 50% more
synchronous pairs versus a standard FDR-controlling analysis. The companion R
package FDRreg implements all methods described in the paper.

an increase in black hole mass, the only constraint being that, relatively
smaller values of $\Lambda$ has to be considered in comparison to $\lambda$.
But in case of flat universe, possibility of the star undergoing a collapse in
highly unlikely. Moreover it is seen that the most favourable environment for

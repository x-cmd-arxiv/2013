sensitive pulsation, as well as higher frequency Delta Scuti type pulsation
typical for p-modes, sensitive to the envelope, make HD 8801 a remarkable
hybrid pulsator with the potential to probe a stellar structure over a wide
range of radius. In addition HD 8801 is a rare pulsating metallic line (Am)
star. We determined the astrophysical fundamental parameters to locate HD 8801
in the HR diagram. We analyzed the element abundances, paying close attention
to the errors involved, and confirm the nature of HD 8801 as a metallic line
(Am) star. We also determined an upper limit on the magnetic field strength.
Our abundance analysis is based on classical techniques, but uses for the final
step a model atmosphere calculated with the abundances determined by us. We
also discuss spectropolarimetric observations obtained for HD 8801. This object
is remarkable in several respects. It is a non-magnetic metallic line (Am)
star, pulsating simultaneously in p- and g-modes, but also shows oscillations
with periods in between these two domains, whose excitation requires
explanation. Overall, the pulsational incidence in unevolved classical Am stars
is believed to be quite low; HD 8801 does not conform to this picture. Finally,
about 75% of Am stars are located in short-period binaries, but there is no
evidence that HD 8801 has a companion.

in early rising and impulsive phase, but also in the flare decay phase, and
even in time of after the flare ending. These SMBs are strong bursts with

from the background emission (the quiet Sun, and the underlying flaring

coherent bursts which is related to some non-thermal energy releasing and
production of energetic particles in small scale source region. These facts
show the existence of small scale strong non-thermal energy releasing

most favorable candidate for the formation of SMBs. From plasma mechanism, the
velocities and kinetic energy of fast electrons can be deduced, and the region

quantum phase transition from a topologically nontrivial phase, which supports
Majorana bound states, to a nontopological insulating phase without them. On
both sides of the transition, the system is localized at zero energy albeit

of conductance at one end of the wire obtained at different values of the

the proposed experiment does not directly probe the end Majorana bound states,
it can provide direct evidence for the bulk topological quantum phase
transition itself.

Theory (SCET) and in Fixed-Order perturbation theory. Oriented event-shapes are
distributions of event-shape variables which are differential on the angle
theta_T that the thrust axis forms with the electron-positron beam. We show
that at any order in perturbation theory and for any event shape, only two
angular structures can appear: F_0 = 3/8(1 + cos^2 theta_T) and F_1 = (1 -

beyond perturbation theory, and hence only these two structures are present at

techniques we show that singular terms can only arise in the F_0 term. Since
only the hard function is sensitive to the orientation of the thrust axis, this
statement applies also for recoil-sensitive variables such as Jet Broadening.

field theories: the dipole and the noncommutative deformations of SYM theory.
We find that entanglement entropy in the dipole theory follows a volume law for
regions smaller than the length scale of nonlocality and has a smooth
cross-over to an area law for larger regions. In contrast, in the
noncommutative theory the entanglement entropy follows a volume law for up to a
critical length scale at which a phase transition to an area law occurs. The
critical length scale increases as the UV cutoff is raised, which is indicative
of UV/IR mixing and implies that entanglement entropy in the noncommutative
theory follows a volume law for arbitrary large regions when the size of the
region is fixed as the UV cutoff is removed to infinity. Comparison of
behaviour between these two theories allows us to explain the origin of the
volume law. Since our holographic duals are not asymptotically AdS, minimal
area surfaces used to compute holographic entanglement entropy have novel
behaviours near the boundary of the dual spacetime. We discuss implications of
our results on the scrambling (thermalization) behaviour of these nonlocal

constraints on the sum of all neutrino masses from cosmological observations
two different methods to determine the neutrino mass scale in the laboratory
are pursued: the search for neutrinoless double $\beta$-decay and the direct
neutrino mass search by investigating single $\beta$-decays or electron
captures. The former method is not only sensitive to neutrino masses but also
probes the Majorana character of neutrinos and thus lepton number violation
with high sensitivity. Currently quite a few experiments with different
techniques are being constructed, commissioned or are even running, which aim
for a sensitivity on the neutrino mass of {\cal O}(100) meV. The principle
methods and these experiments will be discussed in this short review.

additive linear associations. In summary, kruX enables the use of robust

at $\sigma R^3/a=3$, confirming a result obtained previously via an energy

are shown to arise from scattering interference around crystalline defects in
NaFeAs, and their spatial anisotropy is a direct consequence of the structural
and stripe-magnetic order present at low temperature. We show that the
anisotropic features persist up to high temperatures in the nominally
tetragonal phase of the crystal. The spatial distribution and energy dependence
of the anisotropy at high temperatures is explained by the persistence of large
amplitude, short-range, unidirectional, antiferroic (stripe) fluctuations,
indicating that strong density wave fluctuations exist and couple to near-Fermi
surface electrons even far from the structural and density wave phase

turbulence with resolutions as large as 512^3. The simulations are supersonic
and mildly sub-Alfvenic, in keeping with the conditions present in molecular
clouds. Such turbulence is thought to influence star formation processes in
molecular clouds because typical cores form on length scales that are
comparable to the dissipation scales of this turbulence in the ions. The
simulations are motivated by the fact that recent studies of isophotologue
lines in molecular clouds have found significant differences in the
linewidth-size relationship for neutral and ion species. The goals of this
paper are to explain those observations using simulations and analytic theory,
present a new set of density-based diagnostics by drawing on similar
diagnostics that have been obtained by studying single-fluid turbulence, and
show that our two-fluid simulations play a vital role in reconciling
alternative models of star formation. The velocity-dependent diagnostics
display a complementarity with the density-dependent diagnostics. We find that
the linewidth-size relationships show a prominent difference between ions and
neutrals when the line of sight is orthogonal to the mean field. This is
because the MHD waves in the ions differ from hydrodynamic waves in the
neutrals. We also find that the density probability distribution functions
(PDFs) show prominent differences between the ions and neutrals when the line
of sight is parallel to the mean field. This is because the velocity
fluctuations in the ions tend to produce column density fluctuations along
field lines. When the magnetic field makes an angle to the line of sight, both
observable differences should be visible. These diagnostics should be easy for
observers to test. This analysis assumes optically thin lines and a mean
magnetic field that is uniform in direction within a cloud.

$\sigma_1(\omega)$ has an anisotropic metallic character. The electronic band
structure reveals two bands crossing the Fermi level, allowing the optical
properties to be described by two free-carrier (Drude) contributions consisting
of a strong, broad component and a weak, narrow term that describes the
increase in $\sigma_1(\omega)$ below $\simeq 15$ meV. The dc-resistivity of
FeCrAs is ``non-metallic'', meaning that it rises in power-law fashion with
decreasing temperature, without any signature of a transport gap. In the
analysis of the optical conductivity, the scattering rates for both Drude
contributions track the dc-resistivity quite well, leading us to conclude that
the non-metallic resistivity of FeCrAs is primarily due to a scattering rate
that increases with decreasing temperature, rather than the loss of free
carriers. The power law $\sigma_1(\omega) \propto \omega^{-0.6}$ is observed in
the near-infrared region and as $T\rightarrow T_N$ spectral weight is
transferred from low to high energy ($\gtrsim 0.6$ eV); these effects may be
explained by either the two-Drude model or Hund's coupling. We also find that a
low-frequency in-plane phonon mode decreases in frequency for $T < T_N$,
suggesting the possibility of spin-phonon coupling.

This simple idea leads us to define a set $M_f$ of matrices associated to $f$.
Surprisingly, $M_f$ turns out to be a commutative matrix algebra when $deg f

  Next we show how to find the minimal free resolution of the graded Artinian

additive components $R/\ann g_i$ are known. From this we get simple formulas
for the Hilbert function $H$ and the graded Betti numbers of $R/\ann f$. We may
use this to compute the dimension of a ""splitting subfamily"" of the parameter

$\PGor (H)$.
  We will also study degenerations of polynomials that split and see how they
relate to $M_f$. This situation is more difficult, but we are able to prove
several partial results that together cover many interesting cases. In
particular, we prove that $f$ has a regular or degenerate splitting if and only
if the ideal $\ann f$ has at least one generator in its socle degree. Finally,

performance. The problem of distributed detection is formulated as a binary

incapable of utilizing the sensor data for detection. We analyze the problem
under different attacking scenarios and derive results for different

gravitational potential well. The axions thermalize sufficiently fast by
gravitational self-interactions that almost all go to their lowest energy state
consistent with the total angular momentum acquired from tidal torquing. That
state is a state of rigid rotation on the turnaround sphere. It predicts the
occurrence and detailed properties of the caustic rings of dark matter for
which observational evidence had been found earlier. We show that the vortices
in the axion Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) are attractive, unlike those in
superfluid $^4$He and dilute gases. We expect that a large fraction of the
vortices in the axion BEC join into a single big vortex along the rotation axis
of the galaxy. The resulting enhancement of caustic rings explains the typical
size of the rises in the Milky Way rotation curve attributed to caustic rings.
We show that baryons and ordinary cold dark matter particles are entrained by
the axion BEC and acquire the same velocity distribution. The resulting
baryonic angular momentum distribution gives a good qualitative fit to the
distributions observed in dwarf galaxies. We give estimates of the minimum
fraction of dark matter that is axions.

determined. To disentangle different models requires detailed comparisons
between theoretical predictions and multi-wavelength observations. Our previous
simulations have demonstrated that the primary features of the Fermi bubbles
could be successfully reproduced by recent jet activity from the central active
galactic nucleus (AGN). In this work, we generate gamma-ray and microwave maps
and spectra based on the simulated properties of cosmic rays (CRs) and magnetic
fields in order to examine whether the observed bubble and haze emission could
be explained by leptons contained in the AGN jets. We also investigate the
model predictions of the polarization properties of the Fermi bubbles. We find
that: (1) The same population of leptons can simultaneously explain the bubble
and haze emission given that the magnetic fields within the bubbles are very
close to the exponentially distributed ambient field, which can be explained by
mixing in of the ambient field followed by turbulent field amplification; (2)
The centrally peaked microwave profile suggests CR replenishment, which is
consistent with the presence of a more recent second jet event; (3) The bubble
interior exhibits a high degree of polarization because of ordered radial
magnetic field lines stretched by elongated vortices behind the shocks;
highly-polarized signals could also be observed inside the draping layer; (4)
Enhancement of rotation measures could exist within the shock-compressed layer
because of increased gas density and more amplified and ordered magnetic
fields. We discuss the possibility that the deficient haze emission at b<-35
degrees is due to the suppression of magnetic fields, which is consistent with
the existence of lower-energy CRs causing the polarized emission at 2.3 GHz.
Possible AGN jet composition in the leptonic scenario is also discussed.

around isolated ~L* hosts in the local Universe using spectroscopically
confirmed systems in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR7. Our selection method is
carefully designed with the aid of N-body simulations to avoid groups and
clusters. We find that satellites are significantly more likely to be quenched
than a stellar mass-matched sample of isolated galaxies. Remarkably, this
quenching occurs only for satellites of hosts that are themselves quenched:
while star formation is unaffected in the satellites of star-forming hosts,
satellites around quiescent hosts are more than twice as likely to be quenched
than stellar-mass matched field samples. One implication of this is that
whatever shuts down star formation in isolated, passive L* galaxies also plays
at least an indirect role in quenching star formation in their bright
satellites. The previously-reported tendency for ""galactic conformity"" in
color/morphology may be a by-product of this host-specific quenching dichotomy.
The S\'ersic indices of quenched satellites are statistically identical to
those of field galaxies with the same specific star formation rates, suggesting
that environmental and secular quenching give rise to the same morphological
structure. By studying the distribution of pairwise velocities between the
hosts and satellites, we find dynamical evidence that passive host galaxies
reside in dark matter halos that are ~45% more massive than those of
star-forming host galaxies of the same stellar mass. We emphasize that even
around passive hosts, the mere fact that galaxies become satellites does not
typically result in star formation quenching: we find that only ~30% of ~0.1 L*
galaxies that fall in from the field are quenched around passive hosts,
compared with ~0% around star forming hosts.

sample of 443 H\alpha-selected star-forming galaxies in the COSMOS and UDS
fields detected by the HiZELS imaging survey. Sources are identified using
narrow-band filters in combination with broad-band photometry to uniformly
select H\alpha\ (and [OII] if available) emitters in a narrow redshift slice at
z = 1.47+/-0.02. We use a stacking approach in Spitzer, Herschel (from PEP and
HerMES surveys) and AzTEC images to describe their typical FIR properties. We
find that HiZELS galaxies with observed H\alpha\ luminosities of ~ 10^{8.1-9.1}
Lo have bolometric FIR luminosities of typical LIRGs, L_FIR ~ 10^{11.48+/-0.05}
Lo. Combining the H\alpha\ and FIR luminosities, we derive median SFR = 32+/-5
Mo/yr and H\alpha\ extinctions of A(H\alpha) = 1.0+/-0.2 mag. Perhaps
surprisingly, little difference is seen in typical HiZELS extinction levels
compared to local star-forming galaxies. We confirm previous empirical stellar
mass (M*) to A(H\alpha) relations and the little or no evolution up to z =
1.47. For HiZELS galaxies, we provide an empirical parametrisation of the SFR
as a function of (u-z)_rest colours and 3.6\mu m photometry. We find that the
observed H\alpha\ luminosity is a dominant SFR tracer when (u-z)_rest ~< 0.9
mag or when 3.6\mu m photometry > 22 mag (Vega) or when M* < 10^9.7 Mo. We do
not find any correlation between the [OII]/H\alpha\ and FIR luminosity,
suggesting that this emission line ratio does not trace the extinction of the
most obscured star-forming regions. The luminosity-limited HiZELS sample tends
to lie above of the so-called `main sequence' for star-forming galaxies,
especially at low M*. This work suggests that obscured star formation is linked
to the assembly of M*, with deeper potential wells in massive galaxies
providing dense, heavily obscured environments in which stars can form rapidly.

article, we discuss the phenomenology of neutralino dark matter in such models,
including the calculation of the thermal relic abundance, and constraints and
prospects for direct and indirect searches. Due to the large elastic scattering
cross sections with nuclei predicted in R-symmetric models, we are forced to
consider a neutralino that is predominantly bino, with very little higgsino
mixing. We find a large region of parameter space in which bino-like Dirac
neutralinos with masses between 10 and 380 GeV can annihilate through slepton
exchange to provide a thermal relic abundance in agreement with the observed
cosmological density, without relying on coannihilations or resonant
annihilations. The signatures for the indirect detection of Dirac neutralinos
are very different than predicted in the Majorana case, with annihilations
proceeding dominately to $\tau^+ \tau^-$, $\mu^+ \mu^-$ and $e^+ e^-$ final
states, without the standard chirality suppression. And unlike Majorana dark
matter candidates, Dirac neutralinos experience spin-independent scattering
with nuclei through vector couplings (via $Z$ and squark exchange), leading to
potentially large rates at direct detection experiments. These and other
characteristics make Dirac neutralinos potentially interesting within the
context of recent direct and indirect detection anomalies. We also discuss the
case in which the introduction of a small Majorana mass term breaks the
$R$-symmetry, splitting the Dirac neutralino into a pair of nearly degenerate
Majorana states.

made with gravitational-wave observatories. Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo
will be able to observe neutron-star-black-hole mergers at a maximum distance
of 900Mpc. To acheive this sensitivity, gravitational-wave searches will rely
on using a bank of filter waveforms that accurately model the expected
gravitational-wave signal. The angular momentum of the black hole is expected
to be comparable to the orbital angular momentum. This angular momentum will
affect the dynamics of the inspiralling system and alter the phase evolution of
the emitted gravitational-wave signal. In addition, if the black hole's angular
momentum is not aligned with the orbital angular momentum it will cause the
orbital plane of the system to precess. In this work we demonstrate that if the
effect of the black hole's angular momentum is neglected in the waveform models
used in gravitational-wave searches, the detection rate of $(10+1.4)M_{\odot}$
neutron-star--black-hole systems would be reduced by $33 - 37%$. The error in
this measurement is due to uncertainty in the Post-Newtonian approximations
that are used to model the gravitational-wave signal of neutron-star-black-hole
inspiralling binaries. We describe a new method for creating a bank of filter
waveforms where the black hole has non-zero angular momentum, but is aligned
with the orbital angular momentum. With this bank we find that the detection
rate of $(10+1.4)M_{\odot}$ neutron-star-black-hole systems would be reduced by
$26-33%$. Systems that will not be detected are ones where the precession of
the orbital plane causes the gravitational-wave signal to match poorly with

established technique at Jefferson Lab and provides a new opportunity to
measure the weak charge distribution and hence pin down the neutron radius in
nuclei in a relatively clean and model-independent way. This is because the Z
boson of the weak interaction couples primarily to neutrons. We will describe
the PREX and CREX experiments on ${}^{208}$Pb and ${}^{48}$Ca respectively;
these are both doubly-magic nuclei whose first excited state can be
discriminated by the high resolution spectrometers at JLab. The heavier lead
nucleus, with a neutron excess, provides an interpretation of the neutron skin
thickness in terms of properties of bulk neutron matter. For the lighter
${}^{48}$Ca nucleus, which is also rich in neutrons, microscopic nuclear theory
calculations are feasible and are sensitive to poorly constrained 3-neutron
forces.

semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. This paper is the first in a series
to arise from the SUSSING MERGER TREES Workshop in which ten different
tree-building algorithms were applied to the same set of halo catalogues and
their results compared. Although many of these codes were similar in nature,
all algorithms produced distinct results. Our main conclusions are that a
useful merger-tree code should possess the following features: (i) the use of
particle IDs to match haloes between snapshots; (ii) the ability to skip at
least one, and preferably more, snapshots in order to recover subhaloes that
are temporarily lost during merging; (iii) the ability to cope with (and
ideally smooth out) large, temporary flucuations in halo mass. Finally, to
enable different groups to communicate effectively, we defined a common
terminology that we used when discussing merger trees and we encourage others
to adopt the same language. We also specified a minimal output format to record

images based on color combinations is proposed. The purpose of this color
transfer is to change the ""look and feel"" of images, i.e., evoking different
emotions. Colors are confirmed as the most attractive factor in images. In
addition, various studies in both art and science areas have concluded that
other than single color, color combinations are necessary to evoke specific
emotions. Therefore, we propose a novel framework to transfer color of images
based on color combinations, using a predefined color emotion model. The
contribution of this new framework is three-fold. First, users do not need to
provide reference images as used in traditional color transfer algorithms. In
most situations, users may not have enough aesthetic knowledge or path to
choose desired reference images. Second, because of the usage of color
combinations instead of single color for emotions, a new color transfer
algorithm that does not require an image library is proposed. Third, again
because of the usage of color combinations, artifacts that are normally seen in
traditional frameworks using single color are avoided. We present encouraging
results generated from this new framework and its potential in several possible
applications including color transfer of photos and paintings.

probes of the epoch of reionization (EoR). Unpolarized 21 cm radiation acquires
a certain level of linear polarization during the EoR due to Thompson
scattering. This linear polarization, if measured, could probe important
information about the EoR. We study the effect of Galactic Faraday rotation
(FR) in the detection of polarization of 21 cm radiation. Since the effect of
FR is strong due to the large wavelength nature of redshifted 21 cm signal, the
initial E-mode signal carried by 21 cm photons is modified in its entirety. We
show that a 99 % accuracy on rotation measure (RM) data is necessary to recover
the initial E-mode signal. We conclude that, given the current status of RM
observations, it is not possible to retrieve the initial polarization signal of
21 cm from the EoR. However, we are optimistic that it may be possible from the
next generation radio surveys.

performance by astronomical factors. Specifically, the probability of
discrimination error can be suppressed by many orders of magnitude. Likewise,
the number of stimuli encoded--the capacity--can be enhanced by similarly large
factors. These effects do not necessitate unrealistic correlation values and
can occur for populations with a few tens of neurons. We further show that both
effects benefit from heterogeneity commonly seen in population activity. Error
suppression and capacity enhancement rest upon a pattern of correlation. In the
limit of perfect coding, this pattern leads to a `lock-in' of response
probabilities that eliminates variability in the subspace relevant for stimulus
discrimination. We discuss the nature of this pattern and suggest experimental
tests to identify it.

systematically below the power-law behavior expected from large-scale structure
formation models which include only the heating associated with gravitational
collapse. The pressure profile beyond ~0.6r_200 shows an excess with respect to
the best-fit model describing the SZ measurements for a sample of clusters
observed with Planck. The inconsistency between the expected and measured
density, entropy, and pressure profiles can be explained primarily by an
overestimation of the density due to inhomogeneous gas distribution in the
outskirts; there is no evidence for a bias in the temperature measurements
within the virial radius. We find significant differences in thermodynamic
properties of the ICM at large radii along the different arms. Along the
cluster minor axis, we find a flattening of the entropy profiles outside
~0.6r_200, while along the major axis, the entropy rises all the way to the
outskirts. Correspondingly, the inferred gas clumping factor is typically
larger along the minor than along the major axis.

and a centripetal acceleration. We advance the hypothesis, based on
justification via the path integral formalism, that if one associates an Unruh

conventional half-duplex relaying. TWR is possible when two nodes exchange data
simultaneously through a relay. In cellular systems, data exchange between base
station (BS) and users is usually not simultaneous e.g., a user (TUE) has
uplink data to transmit during multiple access (MAC) phase, but does not have
downlink data to receive during broadcast (BC) phase. This non-simultaneous
data exchange will reduce TWR to spectrally-inefficient conventional
half-duplex relaying. With infrastructure relays, where multiple users
communicate through a relay, a new transmission protocol is proposed to recover
the spectral loss. The BC phase following the MAC phase of TUE is now used by
the relay to transmit downlink data to another user (RUE). RUE will not be able
to cancel the back-propagating interference. A structured precoder is designed
at the multi-antenna relay to cancel this interference. With multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) nodes, the proposed precoder also triangulates the
compound MAC and BC phase MIMO channels. The channel triangulation reduces the
weighted sum-rate optimization to power allocation problem, which is then cast
as a geometric program. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the
proposed protocol over conventional solutions.

Huntington's disease (HD) and mutations to TP53 which is associated with
different cancers are studied as two example cases. We construct the PPIN of
wild type and mutant proteins separately and identify the structural modules of
each of the networks. The functional role of these modules are then assessed by
Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis for biological processes (BPs). We find
that a large number of significantly enriched (p<0.0001) GO terms in mutant
PPIN were absent in the wild type PPIN indicating the gain of BPs due to
mutation. Similarly some of the GO terms enriched in wild type PPIN cease to
exist in the modules of mutant PPIN, representing the loss. GO terms common in
modules of mutant and wild type networks indicate both loss and gain of BPs. We
further assign relevant biological function(s) to each module by classifying
the enriched GO terms associated with it. It turns out that most of these
biological functions in HTT networks are already known to be altered in HD and
those of TP53 networks are altered in cancers. We argue that gain of BPs, and
the corresponding biological functions, are due to new interacting partners
acquired by mutant proteins. The methodology we adopt here could be applied to
genetic diseases where mutations alter the ability of the protein to interact
with other proteins.

the volume mode clusters (Na$_{27}$, Na$_{51}$, Na$_{65}$, Na$_{89}$ and

narrower principal absorption peak because their surface plasmon energy is
located well within that of the unperturbed electron-hole transitions, and
their density responses already bear resemblance to that of classical Mie
theory. Moreover, it is found that the volume plasmon that exist only in finite
size particles, gives rise to the long absorption tail in the UV region. This
volume plasmon manifests itself in the absorption spectrum even for clusters as

transfer code using Monte Carlo technique and its application to various

spectra coming out of the electron cloud of an accretion disk around compact
objects, such as black hole X-ray binaries (XRBs). Physical processes included
in this code are the relativistic Maxwell-Juttner momentum distribution of the
electrons, Compton scattering with these electrons, and gravitational red shift
of the photons. Due to general nature of the code, processes like synchrotron
radiation, bremsstrahlung radiation, Coulomb coupling and the pair production
are also possible to incorporate. Various types of photon energy distribution
(e.g., mono-energetic, power-law, black-body and multi-colour black body) and
geometry of the photon source (e.g., point or disk) can be used. In this
Thesis, we have mainly used multi-color black body photons coming out of a
Keplerian disk as the source of soft radiation. This soft radiation is
intercepted by the electron cloud. Depending on the optical depth of the cloud,
and energy of the electrons, the soft photons may get Comptonized and

accreting through Rayleigh-Taylor instability, which occurs at the interface
between an accretion disk and a stellar magnetosphere. In this study, the
results of global 3-D MHD simulations of accretion flows, in both stable and
unstable regimes, are used to predict the variability of hydrogen emission
lines and light curves associated with those two distinctive accretion flow
patterns. In the stable regime, a redshifted absorption component (RAC)
periodically appears in some hydrogen lines, but only during a fraction of a
stellar rotation period. In the unstable regime, the RAC is present rather
persistently during a whole stellar rotation period, and its strength varies
non-periodically. The latter is caused by multiple accreting streams, formed
randomly due to the instability, passing across the line of sight to an
observer during one stellar rotation. This results in the quasi-stationarity
appearance of the RAC because at least one of the accretion stream is almost
always in the line of sight to an observer. In the stable regime, two stable
hot spots produce a smooth and periodic light curve that shows only one or two
peaks per stellar rotation. In the unstable regime, multiple hot spots formed
on the surface of the star, produce the stochastic light curve with several
peaks per rotation period.

attracted increasing interest as an important supportive clinical and

diagnostic measurements and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). It first provides
a precise definition of population-based MCID so that estimating such a MCID
can be formulated as a large margin classification problem. The framework is
then extended to personalized MCID to allow individualized thresholding value
for patients whose clinical profiles may affect their PRO responses. More
importantly, we show that the proposed estimation framework is asymptotically
consistent, and a finite-sample upper bound is established for its prediction
accuracy compared against the ideal MCID. The advantage of our proposed method
is also demonstrated in a variety of simulated experiments as well as
applications to two benchmark datasets and two phase-3 clinical trials.

ranging from excursion theory to potential and PDE theory and have been used in
many different branches of pure and applied probability.

McCann on the geometry of optimal transport, we establish a geometric
characterization of Skorokhod embeddings with desired optimality properties.
This leads to a systematic method to construct optimal embeddings. It allows

massive, rapidly rotating stars, are expected to exhibit a high density
accretion disk around them developed from the spinning mantle of the collapsing
star. A wide class of such disks, due to their high density and temperature,
are effective emitters of neutrinos and hence called neutrino cooled disks.
Tracking the physics relating the observed (neutrino) luminosity to the mass,
spin of black holes (BHs) and the accretion rate (M_dot) of such disks, here we
establish a correlation between the spin and mass of SMBHs at their formation
stage. Our work shows that spinning BHs are more massive than non-spinning BHs
for a given M_dot. However, slowly spinning BHs can turn out to be more massive
than spinning BHs if M_dot at their formation stage was higher compared to
faster spinning BHs.

  Routing","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1307.3402,
  arXiv:1307.3550",,,,"cs.CR cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  An ad hoc network is a self-organizing network with help of Access Point (AP)
of wireless links connecting nodes to another. The nodes can communicate
without infrastructure network. They form an random topology (BSS/ESS), where
the nodes play the role of routers and are free to move arbitrarily. Ad hoc
networks confirmed their efficiency being used in different fields but they are
highly vulnerable to security attacks and dealing with this is one of the main
challenges of these networks today. In recent times, a few solutions are
proposed to provide authentication, confidentiality, availability, secure
routing and intrusion prevention in ad hoc networks. Employ security in such
dynamically changing networks is a hard task. Ad hoc network uniqueness must be
taken into contemplation to be clever to design efficient clarification. Here
we spotlight on improving the flow transmission confidentiality in ad hoc
networks based on unipath routing. Definitely, we take advantage of the being
of multiple paths between nodes in an ad hoc network to increase the
confidentiality robustness of transmitted data with the help of Access Point.
In our approach the original message to secure is split into shares through
access point that are encrypted and combined then transmitted along different
disjointed existing paths between sender and receiver. Still if an attacker
succeeds to attain one or more transmitted contribute to the probability that
the unique message will be reconstituted is very low.

  Adjust Personal Information Privacy Settings","16 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables","International Journal of Security, Privacy and Trust
  Management,Vol2,No3,2013","10.5121/ijsptm.2013.2301",,"cs.CY cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The privacy of personal information is an important issue affecting the
confidence of internet users. The widespread adoption of online social networks
and access to these platforms using mobile devices has encouraged developers to
make the systems and interfaces acceptable to users who seek privacy. The aim
of this study is to test a wizard that allows users to control the sharing of
personal information with others. We also assess the concerns of users in terms
of such sharing such as whether to hide personal data in current online social
network accounts. Survey results showed the wizard worked very well and that
females concealed more personal information than did males. In addition, most
users who were concerned about misuse of personal information hid those items.
The results can be used to upgrade current privacy systems or to design new
systems that work on mobile internet devices. The system can also be used to
save time when setting personal privacy settings and makes users more aware of
items that will be shared with others.

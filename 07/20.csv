of the four Network Access Points that were mandated as part of the
decommissioning of the NSFNET in 1994/95 to facilitate the transition from the
NSFNET to the ""public Internet"" as we know it today. While this popular view
does not tell the whole story behind the early beginnings of IXPs, what is true
is that since around 1994, the number of operational IXPs worldwide has grown
to more than 300 (as of May 2013), with the largest IXPs handling daily traffic
volumes comparable to those carried by the largest Tier-1 ISPs, but IXPs have
never really attracted any attention from the networking research community. At
first glance, this lack of interest seems understandable as IXPs have
apparently little to do with current ""hot"" topic areas such as data centers and
cloud services or software defined networking (SDN) and mobile communication.
However, we argue in this article that, in fact, IXPs are all about data
centers and cloud services and even SDN and mobile communication and should be
of great interest to networking researchers interested in understanding the
current and future Internet ecosystem. To this end, we survey the existing but
largely unknown sources of publicly available information about IXPs to
describe their basic technical and operational aspects and highlight the
critical differences among the various IXPs in the different regions of the
world, especially in Europe and North America. More importantly, we illustrate
the important role that IXPs play in today's Internet ecosystem and discuss how
IXP-driven innovation in Europe is shaping and redefining the Internet
marketplace, not only in Europe but increasingly so around the world.

  2013-01-02",,,,"physics.soc-ph q-fin.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  High and volatile global food prices have led to food riots and played a
critical role in triggering the Arab Spring revolutions in recent years. The
severe drought in the US in the summer of 2012 led to a new increase in food
prices. Through the fall, they remained at a threshold above which the riots
and revolutions had predominantly occurred. Global prices at this level create
conditions where an exacerbating local circumstance can trigger unrest. Global
corn (maize) prices reached new highs, and countries that depend mostly on
maize are more likely to experience high local food prices and associated
pressures toward social unrest. Here we analyze the conditions in South Africa,
which is a heavily maize-dependent country. Coinciding with increased consumer
food indices this summer, massive labor strikes in mining and agriculture have
led to the greatest single incident of social violence since the fall of
apartheid in 1994. Worker demands for dramatic pay increases reflect that their
wages have not kept up with drastic increases in the prices of necessities,
especially food. Without attention to the global food price situation, more
incidents of food-based social instability are likely to arise. Other countries
that have manifested food-related protests and riots in 2012 include Haiti and
Argentina. Moreover, these cases of unrest are just the most visible symptom of
widespread suffering of poor populations worldwide due to elevated food prices.
Policy decisions that would directly impact food prices are decreasing the
conversion of maize to ethanol in the US, and reimposing regulations on
commodity futures markets to prevent excessive speculation, which we have shown
causes bubbles and crashes in these markets. Absent such policy actions,
governments and companies should track and mitigate the impact of high and
volatile food prices on citizens and employees.

longitudinally polarized electrons on a 34.4cm long liquid hydrogen target at

From these initial results the measured asymmetry is Aep = -279 +- 35

from the 6dFGS, SDSS DR7 and BOSS DR9 surveys, HST $H_0$ measurement and
supernovae from Union2.1 compilation. We also use WMAP9yr data for consistency
check and comparison. For $f(R)$ gravity, WMAP9yr results can only give quite a
loose constraint on the modified gravity parameter $B_0$, which is related to
the present value of the Compton wavelength of the extra scalar degree of
freedom, $B_0<3.37$ at $95\% {\rm C.L.}$ We demonstrate that this constraint
mainly comes from the late ISW effect. With only Planck CMB temperature
power-spectrum data, we can improve the WMAP9yr result by a factor $3.7$
($B_0<0.91$ at $95\% {\rm C.L.}$). If the Planck lensing potential
power-spectrum data are also taken into account, the constraint can be further
strenghtened by a factor $5.1$ ($B_0<0.18$ at $95\% {\rm C.L.}$). This major
improvement mainly comes from the small-scale lensing signal. Furthermore, BAO,
HST and supernovae data could slightly improve the $B_0$ bound ($B_0<0.12$ at
$95\% {\rm C.L.}$).For the chameleon-type model, we find that the data set
which we used cannot constrain the Compton wavelength $B_0$ and the potential
index $s$ of chameleon field, but can give a tight constraint on the parameter
$\beta_1=1.043^{+0.163}_{-0.104}$ at $95\% {\rm C.L.}$ ($\beta_1=1$ in general
relativity), which accounts for the non-minimal coupling between the chameleon
field and the matter component. In addition, we find that both modified gravity
models we considered favor a relatively higher Hubble parameter than the
concordance LCDM model in general relativity.

originating from the embedded massive star-forming region known as OMC1-S. The

are still hidden behind large extinction, preventing their direct observation
at optical and even near and mid-IR wavelengths. With the aim of improving the
identification of the driving sources of the multiple outflows detected in

unveiled the very embedded population of pre-main sequence stars. We compared
the position of stars observed by the Chandra Orion Ultra Deep project (COUP)
in OMC1-S with the morphology of the molecular outflows and the directions of
measured proper motions of HH optical objects. We find that 6 out of 7
molecular outflows reported in OMC1-S (detection rate of 86 %) have an
extincted X-ray COUP star located at the expected position of the driving
source. In several cases, X-rays detected the possible driving sources for the
first time. This clustered embedded population revealed by Chandra is very
young, with an estimated average age of few 10^{5} yr. It is also likely
responsible for the multiple HH objects, which are the optical correspondence
of flows arising from the cloud. We show that the molecular outflows driven by
the members of the OMC1-S cluster can account for the observed turbulence at
core-scales and regulate the star formation efficiency. We discuss the effects

such systems equilibrating after a strong initial quench such as the
overpopulation of the infrared modes. While the final equilibrium state does
not support confinement, metastable vortex defect configurations appear in the
gauge field which are found to be closely related to the appearance of
physically observable confined electric and magnetic charges. These phenomena
are seen to be intimately related to the approach of a non-thermal fixed point
of the far-from-equilibrium dynamical evolution, signalled by universal scaling
in the gauge-invariant correlation function of the Higgs field. Even when the
parameters of the Higgs action do not support condensate formation in the
vacuum, during this approach, transient Higgs condensation is observed. We
discuss implications of these results for the far-from-equilibrium dynamics of
Yang-Mills fields and potential mechanisms how confinement and condensation in
non-abelian gauge fields can be understood in terms of the dynamics of Higgs
models. These suggest that there is an interesting new class of dynamics of

The algorithm embeds the trajectory of the Markov chain into a reproducing
kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), such that the feature space covariance of the
samples informs the choice of proposal. The procedure is computationally
efficient and straightforward to implement, since the RKHS moves can be
integrated out analytically: our proposal distribution in the original space is
a normal distribution whose mean and covariance depend on where the current
sample lies in the support of the target distribution, and adapts to its local
covariance structure. Furthermore, the procedure requires neither gradients nor
any other higher order information about the target, making it particularly
attractive for contexts such as Pseudo-Marginal MCMC. Kernel Adaptive
Metropolis-Hastings outperforms competing fixed and adaptive samplers on
multivariate, highly nonlinear target distributions, arising in both real-world

the spectrum of a $C^*$-subalgebra $\mathfrak{A}$ of the bounded functions on

In the present paper, we apply this to the framework of loop quantum gravity.
We show that, on the level of the configuration spaces, quantization and
reduction in general do not commute, i.e., that the symmetry-reduced quantum
configuration space is (strictly) larger than the quantized configuration space
of the reduced classical theory. Here, the quantum-reduced space has the
advantage to be completely characterized by a simple algebraic relation,
whereby the quantized reduced classical space is usually hard to compute.

Individuals tend to be
friends with the people they spend time with and they choose to spend time with
their friends, inextricably entangling physical location and social
relationships. As a result, it is possible to predict not only someone's
location from their friends' locations but also friendship from spatial and
temporal co-occurrence. While several models have been developed to separately
describe mobility and the evolution of social networks, there is a lack of
studies coupling social interactions and mobility. In this work, we introduce a
new model that bridges this gap by explicitly considering the feedback of
mobility on the formation of social ties. Data coming from three online social
networks (Twitter, Gowalla and Brightkite) is used for validation. Our model
reproduces various topological and physical properties of these networks such
as: i) the size of the connected components, ii) the distance distribution
between connected users, iii) the dependence of the reciprocity on the
distance, iv) the variation of the social overlap and the clustering with the
distance. Besides numerical simulations, a mean-field approach is also used to
study analytically the main statistical features of the networks generated by
the model. The robustness of the results to changes in the model parameters is
explored, finding that a balance between friend visits and long-range random
connections is essential to reproduce the geographical features of the
empirical networks.

numerical waveforms from binary black holes with moderate mass ratios and
spins, as well as one non-spinning binary configuration which has a mass ratio
of 10. All of the numerical waveforms are analysed in a uniform and consistent
manner, with numerical errors evaluated using an analysis code created by
members of the NRAR collaboration. We compare previously-calibrated,
non-precessing analytical waveforms, notably the effective-one-body (EOB) and
phenomenological template families, to the newly-produced numerical waveforms.
We find that when the binary's total mass is ~100-200 solar masses, current EOB
and phenomenological models of spinning, non-precessing binary waveforms have
overlaps above 99% (for advanced LIGO) with all of the non-precessing-binary
numerical waveforms with mass ratios <= 4, when maximizing over binary
parameters. This implies that the loss of event rate due to modelling error is
below 3%. Moreover, the non-spinning EOB waveforms previously calibrated to
five non-spinning waveforms with mass ratio smaller than 6 have overlaps above
99.7% with the numerical waveform with a mass ratio of 10, without even
maximizing on the binary parameters.

any explicit measurement or feedback, nor does it simply involve a modulation
of an optical spring constant. Instead, it uses a dissipative mechanism with
the driven cavity acting as an engineered reservoir. It can equivalently be
viewed as a coherent feedback process, obtained by minimally perturbing the
quantum nondemolition measurement of a single mechanical quadrature. This shows
that in general the concepts of coherent feedback schemes and reservoir
engineering are closely related. We analyze how to optimize the scheme, how the
squeezing scales with system parameters, and how it may be directly detected
from the cavity output. Our scheme is extremely general, and could also be
implemented with, e.g., superconducting circuits.

of an increasingly large number of star-forming galaxies both locally and at
high redshift. The main goal of this study is to review the most widely used
empirical oxygen calibrations, O3N2 and N2, by using new direct abundance
measurements. We pay special attention to the expected uncertainty of these
calibrations as a function of the index value or abundance derived and the
presence of possible systematic offsets. This is possible thanks to the
analysis of the most ambitious compilation of Te-based HII regions to date.
This new dataset compiles the Te-based abundances of 603 HII regions extracted
from the literature but also includes new measurements from the CALIFA survey.
Besides providing new and improved empirical calibrations for the gas
abundance, we also present here a comparison between our revisited calibrations
with a total of 3423 additional CALIFA HII complexes with abundances derived
using the ONS calibration by Pilyugin et al. (2010). The combined analysis of
Te-based and ONS abundances allows us to derive their most accurate calibration
to date for both the O3N2 and N2 single-ratio indicators, in terms of all
statistical significance, quality and coverage of the space of parameters. In
particular, we infer that these indicators show shallower abundance
dependencies and statistically-significant offsets compared to those of Pettini
and Pagel (2004), Nagao et al. (2006) and P\'erez-Montero and Contini (2009).
The O3N2 and N2 indicators can be empirically applied to derive oxygen
abundances calibrations from either direct abundance determinations with random
errors of 0.18 and 0.16, respectively, or from indirect ones (but based on a
large amount of data) reaching an average precision of 0.08 and 0.09 dex

logically incoherent. It was only recently that the use of repair techniques to
improve the quality of ontology alignments has been explored. In this paper we
present a novel technique for detecting incoherent concepts based on ontology
modularization, and a new repair algorithm that minimizes the incoherence of
the resulting alignment and the number of matches removed from the input
alignment. An implementation was done as part of a lightweight version of
AgreementMaker system, a successful ontology matching platform, and evaluated
using a set of four benchmark biomedical ontology matching tasks. Our results
show that our implementation is efficient and produces better alignments with

in some cases are nearly as strong as the annual modulation. These higher-order
modes are particularly relevant if (i) the dark matter is light, O(10) GeV,
(ii) the scattering is inelastic, or (iii) velocity substructure is present;
for these cases, the higher-frequency modes are potentially observable at
current and ton-scale detectors. We derive simple expressions for the harmonic
modes as functions of the astrophysical and geophysical parameters describing
the Earth's orbit, using an updated expression for the Earth's velocity that
corrects a common error in the literature. For an isotropic halo velocity
distribution, certain ratios of the modes are approximately constant as a
function of nuclear recoil energy. Anisotropic distributions can also leave
observable features in the harmonic spectrum. Consequently, the higher-order
harmonic modes are a powerful tool for identifying a potential signal from

using repeated observations of the Pan-STARRS1 Medium-Deep Survey (PS1/MDS)
fields. Our search takes advantage of the consecutive g/r-band observations
(16.5 min in each filter), by requiring detections in both bands, with
non-detections on preceding and subsequent nights. We identify 19 transients
brighter than 22.5 AB mag (S/N>10). Of these, 11 events exhibit quiescent
counterparts in the deep PS1/MDS templates that we identify as M4-M9 dwarfs.
The remaining 8 transients exhibit a range of properties indicative of
main-belt asteroids near the stationary point of their orbits. With
identifications for all 19 transients, we place an upper limit of
R_FOT(0.5hr)<0.12 deg^-2 d^-1 (95% confidence level) on the sky-projected rate
of extragalactic fast transients at <22.5 mag, a factor of 30-50 times lower
than previous limits; the limit for a timescale of ~day is R_FOT<2.4e-3 deg^-2
d^-1. To convert these sky-projected rates to volumetric rates, we explore the
expected peak luminosities of fast optical transients powered by various
mechanisms, and find that non-relativistic events are limited to M~-10 mag
(M~-14 mag) for a timescale of ~0.5 hr (~day), while relativistic sources
(e.g., GRBs, magnetar-powered transients) can reach much larger luminosities.
The resulting volumetric rates are <13 (M~-10 mag), <0.05 (M~-14 mag) and <1e-6
Mpc^-3 yr^-1 (M~-24 mag), significantly above the nova, supernova, and GRB
rates, respectively, indicating that much larger surveys are required to
provide meaningful constraints. Motivated by the results of our search we
discuss strategies for identifying fast optical transients in the LSST main
survey, and reach the optimistic conclusion that the veil of foreground
contaminants can be lifted with the survey data, without the need for expensive
follow-up observations.

boost, and thermal - heating. We formulate kinetic feedback models for
energy-driven wind (EDW) and momentum-driven wind (MDW), using two free
parameters: feedback efficiency epsilon_f, and AGN wind velocity v_w. A novel
numerical algorithm is implemented in the SPH code GADGET-3, to prevent the
expansion of a hole in the gas distribution around the BH. We perform
simulations of isolated evolution and merger of disk galaxies, of Milky-Way
mass as well as lower and higher masses. We find that in the isolated galaxy BH
kinetic feedback generates intermittent bipolar jet-like gas outflows. We infer
that current prescriptions for BH subgrid physics in galaxy simulations can
grow the BH to observed values even in an isolated disk galaxy. The BH growth
is enhanced in a galaxy merger. Comparing the [M_BH - sigma_star] relation
obtained in our simulations with observational data, we conclude that it is
possible to find parameter sets for a fit in all the models, except for the
case with MDW feedback in a galaxy merger, in which the BH is always too
massive. The BH thermal feedback implementation of Springel, Di Matteo &
Hernquist (2005) within the multiphase star-formation model is found to have
negligible impact on gas properties; and the effect claimed in all previous
studies is attributed to gas depletion around the BH by the creation of an
artificial hole. The BH mass accretion rate in our simulations exhibit heavy
fluctuations. The star formation rate is quenched with feedback by removal of
gas. The CGM gas at galactocentric distances (20 - 100)/h kpc are found to give
the best metallicity observational diagnostic to distinguish between BH models.

in computational finance. In recent research, a substantial effort has been
invested to develop sophisticated financial polarity-lexicons that can be used
to investigate how financial sentiments relate to future company performance.
However, based on experience from other fields, where sentiment analysis is
commonly applied, it is well-known that the overall semantic orientation of a
sentence may differ from the prior polarity of individual words. The objective
of this article is to investigate how semantic orientations can be better
detected in financial and economic news by accommodating the overall
phrase-structure information and domain-specific use of language. Our three
main contributions are: (1) establishment of a human-annotated finance
phrase-bank, which can be used as benchmark for training and evaluating
alternative models; (2) presentation of a technique to enhance financial
lexicons with attributes that help to identify expected direction of events
that affect overall sentiment; (3) development of a linearized phrase-structure
model for detecting contextual semantic orientations in financial and economic
news texts. The relevance of the newly added lexicon features and the benefit
of using the proposed learning-algorithm are demonstrated in a comparative
study against previously used general sentiment models as well as the popular
word frequency models used in recent financial studies. The proposed framework
is parsimonious and avoids the explosion in feature-space caused by the use of
conventional n-gram features.

erg): more luminous than any previous GRB with a spectroscopically associated

host and supernova contributions to the observed light ~17 rest-frame days
after the burst utilising a host subtraction spectrum obtained 1 year later.
Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) grism observations show that the associated
supernova, SN~2013cq, has an overall spectral shape and luminosity similar to
SN 1998bw (with a photospheric velocity, v$_{ph}$ ~15,000 km/s). The positions
of the bluer features are better matched by the higher velocity SN~2010bh
(v$_{ph}$ ~ 30,000 km/s), but SN 2010bh is significantly fainter, and fails to
reproduce the overall spectral shape, perhaps indicative of velocity structure
in the ejecta. We find that the burst originated ~4 kpc from the nucleus of a
moderately star forming (1 Msol/yr), possibly interacting disc galaxy. The
absolute magnitude, physical size and morphology of this galaxy, as well as the
location of the GRB within it are also strikingly similar to those of

high-dimensional setting. The graphical lasso, which involves maximizing the
Gaussian log likelihood subject to an l1 penalty, is a well-studied approach
for this task. We begin by introducing a surprising connection between the
graphical lasso and hierarchical clustering: the graphical lasso in effect
performs a two-step procedure, in which (1) single linkage hierarchical
clustering is performed on the variables in order to identify connected
components, and then (2) an l1-penalized log likelihood is maximized on the
subset of variables within each connected component. In other words, the
graphical lasso determines the connected components of the estimated network
via single linkage clustering. Unfortunately, single linkage clustering is
known to perform poorly in certain settings. Therefore, we propose the cluster
graphical lasso, which involves clustering the features using an alternative to
single linkage clustering, and then performing the graphical lasso on the
subset of variables within each cluster. We establish model selection
consistency for this technique, and demonstrate its improved performance
relative to the graphical lasso in a simulation study, as well as in
applications to an equities data set, a university webpage data set, and a gene
expression data set.

CHM by using exact diagonalization calculations for both potential and hopping
disorder. We characterize the superconducting tendencies of the model by
focusing on the pair binding energy, the spin gap, and d-wave pairing order
parameter. We find that superconducting tendencies, particularly the pair
binding energy, are more robust to disorder when there is inhomogeneous hopping

tensor-based iterative algorithm that simultaneously reconstructs the X-ray
attenuation distribution for each energy. We use a multi-linear image model
rather than a more standard ""stacked vector"" representation in order to develop
novel tensor-based regularizers. Specifically, we model the multi-spectral
unknown as a 3-way tensor where the first two dimensions are space and the
third dimension is energy. This approach allows for the design of tensor
nuclear norm regularizers, which like its two dimensional counterpart, is a
convex function of the multi-spectral unknown. The solution to the resulting
convex optimization problem is obtained using an alternating direction method
of multipliers (ADMM) approach. Simulation results shows that the generalized
tensor nuclear norm can be used as a stand alone regularization technique for
the energy selective (spectral) computed tomography (CT) problem and when
combined with total variation regularization it enhances the regularization
capabilities especially at low energy images where the effects of noise are
most prominent.

extreme violation of Shannon's classical theorem, which states that
information-theoretic security holds in the classical case if and only if the
secret key is the same size as the message. Given this intriguing phenomenon,
it is of practical interest to study the effect in the presence of noise, which
can occur in the systems of both the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper.
This paper formally defines the locking capacity of a quantum channel as the
maximum amount of locked information that can be reliably transmitted to a
legitimate receiver by exploiting many independent uses of a quantum channel
and an amount of secret key sublinear in the number of channel uses. We provide
general operational bounds on the locking capacity in terms of other well-known
capacities from quantum Shannon theory. We also study the important case of
bosonic channels, finding limitations on these channels' locking capacity when
coherent-state encodings are employed and particular locking protocols for
these channels that might be physically implementable.

generated within a stable, well defined and predictive theory which comprises
an inflationary phase. In this model the usual shift symmetry is enhanced up to
the so-called Galileon symmetry. The appeal of this type of theories rests on
being unitary and stable under quantum corrections. Furthermore, in the
specific model under consideration here, these properties have been shown to
approximately hold in realistic scenarios which account for curved spacetime
and the coupling with gravity. In the literature, the analysis of the
bispectrum of the curvature perturbation for this theory revealed non-Gaussian
features which are shared by a number of inflationary models, including stable
ones. It is therefore both timely and useful to investigate further and turn to
observables such as the trispectrum. We find that, in a number of specific
momenta configurations, the trispectrum shape-functions present strikingly
different features as compared to, for example, the entire class of the
so-called $P(X,\phi)$ inflationary models.

preferential adsorption of the two species of the mixture, even though the
corresponding Casimir potential in uncharged systems is repulsive. This
prediction agrees with recent experiment [Nellen {\it{et al.}}, Soft

hydrophobic surfaces can repel each other, although the Casimir potential
between uncharged surfaces with like preferential adsorption (selectivity) is
attractive. This behavior is expected when the electrostatic screening length
is larger than the correlation length, and one of the confining surfaces is
strongly selective and weakly charged, whereas the other confining surface is
weakly selective and strongly charged. The Casimir potential can change sign
because the hydrophilic ions near the weakly hydrophobic surface can
overcompensate the effect of hydrophobicity, and this surface can act as a
hydrophilic one. We also predict a more attractive interaction between
hydrophilic surfaces and a more repulsive interaction between hydrophobic
surfaces than given by the sum of the Casimir and Deby-H\""uckel potentials. Our
theory is derived systematically from a microscopic approach, and combines the

in modern day statistics. A popular approach is to apply l1-penalties to either
(1) parametric likelihoods, or, (2) regularized regression/pseudo-likelihoods,
with the latter having the distinct advantage that they do not explicitly
assume Gaussianity. As none of the popular methods proposed for solving
pseudo-likelihood based objective functions have provable convergence
guarantees, it is not clear if corresponding estimators exist or are even
computable, or if they actually yield correct partial correlation graphs. This
paper proposes a new pseudo-likelihood based graphical model selection method
that aims to overcome some of the shortcomings of current methods, but at the
same time retain all their respective strengths. In particular, we introduce a
novel framework that leads to a convex formulation of the partial covariance
regression graph problem, resulting in an objective function comprised of
quadratic forms. The objective is then optimized via a coordinate-wise
approach. The specific functional form of the objective function facilitates
rigorous convergence analysis leading to convergence guarantees; an important
property that cannot be established using standard results, when the dimension
is larger than the sample size, as is often the case in high dimensional
applications. These convergence guarantees ensure that estimators are
well-defined under very general conditions, and are always computable. In
addition, the approach yields estimators that have good large sample properties
and also respect symmetry. Furthermore, application to simulated/real data,
timing comparisons and numerical convergence is demonstrated. We also present a
novel unifying framework that places all graphical pseudo-likelihood methods as
special cases of a more general formulation, leading to important insights.

remained on the analysis of ring and spiral type instabilities that have shown
dependence on certain initial conditions chosen for a rotating solar mass cloud
of molecular hydrogen. Generally, a star forming hydrogen gas is considered to
be initially at 10K. We have found that a possible oscillation around this
typical value can affect the fate of a collapsing cloud in terms of its
evolving structural properties leading to proto-star formation. We explored the
initial temperature range of cloud between 8K to 12K and compared physical
properties of each within the first phase of proto-star formation. We suggest
that the spiral structures are more likely to form in strongly perturbed
molecular cores that initiate their phase of collapse from temperatures below
10K. Whereas, cores with initial temperatures above 10K develop, instead of
spiral, a ring type structure which subsequently experiences the fragmentation.
A transition from spiral to ring instability can be observed at a typical

changes in much of the design. A high-modulus carbon fiber structure has been
added on the back of the mirror in order to transfer the voice coils forces
with less deformation, thus reducing delay problems due to flexing. The
controller is now an off-the-shelf National Instrument NI-cRIO, and the
amplifier a class D servo drive from Advanced Motion Controls, with high peak
power able to drive the coils at 300 Volts DC. The stow mechanism has been
totally redesigned to improve on the repeatability and precision of the stow
position, which is also the reference for the 26 bits Heidenhain encoders. This
also improves on the accuracy of the stow position with wind loading. Finally,
the software, written largely with National Instrument's LabView, has been
developed. We will discuss these changes and the preliminary performances
achieved to date. Keywords: ALMA, nutator, class D, high-modulus carbon fiber.

produced by the impact of the accreting gas onto young stars predict
quasi-periodic oscillations in the emitted radiation. However, observational
data do not show evidence of such periodicity. Aims. We investigate whether
physically plausible perturbations in the accretion column or in the
chromosphere could disrupt the shock structure influencing the observability of
the oscillatory behavior. Methods. We performed local 2D magneto-hydrodynamical
simulations of an accretion shock impacting a chromosphere, taking optically
thin radiation losses and thermal conduction into account. We investigated the
effects of several perturbation types, such as clumps in the accretion stream
or chromospheric fluctuations, and also explored a wide range of plasma-\beta
values. Results. In the case of a weak magnetic field, the post-shock region
shows chaotic motion and mixing, smoothing out the perturbations and retaining
a global periodic signature. On the other hand, a strong magnetic field
confines the plasma in flux tubes, which leads to the formation of fibrils that
oscillate independently. Realistic values for the amplitude, length, and time
scales of the perturbation are capable of bringing the fibril oscillations out
of phase, suppressing the periodicity of the emission. Conclusions. The
strength of a locally uniform magnetic field in YSO accretion shocks determines
the structure of the post-shock region, namely, whether it will be somewhat
homogeneous or if it will split up to form a collection of fibrils. In the
second case, the size and shape of the fibrils is found to depend strongly on
the plasma-\beta value but not on the perturbation type. Therefore, the actual
value of the protostellar magnetic field is expected to play a critical role in
the time dependence of the observable emission.

photoemission spectrum, to see how two-dimensional pairing fluctuations affect
these single-particle quantities. In the BCS (Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer)-BEC
(Bose-Einstein condensation) crossover region, we show that the local density
of states exhibits a dip structure in the trap center, which is more remarkable
than the three-dimensional case. This pseudogap phenomenon is found to
naturally lead to a double peak structure in the photoemission spectrum. The
peak-to-peak energy of the spectrum at p=0 agrees well with the recent
experiment on a two-dimensional 40K Fermi gas [M. Feld, et al., Nature 480, 75

distinguishable ways. The red halos might have formed via dissipational
processes with rotation, while the blue halos are through accretion.

construction of a braided monoidal category with a tangle algebra and was able
to distinguish blocked two-torsions from the identity.

be related to the notion of rack. We show that if G is a rack then there is a
braided monoidal category TRel_G generalizing that of the above paper. Further
we introduce a variation of the notion of rack which we call irack which yields
a tangle algebra in TRel_G. Iracks are in particular racks but have in addition
to the operations abstracting group conjugation also a unary operation
abstracting group inverse. Using iracks we obtain new invariants for tangles

amenable to regenerative simulation for estimating the steady-state performance
measures. However, typically, identification of a regenerative structure in
these networks is difficult. A well known exception is when all the
interarrival times are exponentially distributed, where the instants
corresponding to customer arrivals to an empty network constitute a
regenerative structure. In this paper, we consider networks where the
interarrival times are generally distributed but have exponential or heavier
tails. We show that these distributions can be decomposed into a mixture of
sums of independent random variables such that at least one of the components
is exponentially distributed. This allows an easily implementable embedded
regenerative structure in the Markov process. We show that under mild
conditions on the network primitives, the regenerative mean and standard

useful for constructing asymptotically valid confidence intervals. We also show
that amongst all such interarrival time decompositions, the one with the
largest mean exponential component minimizes the asymptotic variance of the

the apoA-I belt is modeled as one-dimensional inextensible twist-free chain
endowed with bending elasticity. Stability is investigated using the second
variation of the underlying energy functional. Various planar and nonplanar
instability modes are predicted and corresponding nondimensional critical
values of salient dimensionless parameters are obtained. The results predict
that the first planar and nonplanar unstable modes occur due to in-plane
elliptical and transverse saddle-like perturbations. Based on available data,
detailed stability diagrams indicate the range of input parameters for which a
flat circular discoidal HDL particle is linearly stable or unstable.

conformal mapping of this domain onto a disk. We prove estimates for the rate
of such convergence on domains with piecewise analytic boundaries, expressed
through the smallest exterior angles at the boundary.

qualitatively different physics. For example, massless photon has two
polarization degrees of freedom, while massive photon at least three. This
feature seems counter-intuitive. In this paper we will show that if we change
propagator by setting $i \epsilon$ (needed to avoid poles) to a finite value,
and also introduce it in a way that breaks Lawrentz symmetry, then we would
obtain the continuous transition we desire once the speed of the photons is
""large enough"" with respect to ""preferred"" frame. The two transverse
polarization degrees of freedom will be long lived, while longitudinal will be
short lived. Their lifetime will be near-zero if $m \ll \sqrt{\epsilon}$, which
is where the properties of two circular polarizations arize. The $i \epsilon$
corresponds to the intensity of Mensky's ""continuous measurement"" and the short
lifetime of the longitudinal photons can be understood as the ""conversion"" of
quantum degrees of freedom (photons) into ""classical"" ones by the measurement
device (thus getting rid of the former). While the ""classical"" trajectory of
the longitudinal photons does arize, it plays no physical role due to quantum
Zeno effect: intuitively, it is similar to an electron being kept at a ground
state due to continuous measurement.

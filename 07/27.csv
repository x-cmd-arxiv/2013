binary stars emit high (0.1-100 GeV) and very high energy (>100 GeV) gamma
rays. A new class has emerged called 'gamma-ray binaries', since most of their
radiated power is emitted beyond 1 MeV. Accreting X-ray binaries, novae and a
colliding wind binary (eta Car) have also been detected - 'related systems'
that confirm the ubiquity of particle acceleration in astrophysical sources. Do
these systems have anything in common ? What drives their high-energy emission
? How do the processes involved compare to those in other sources of gamma
rays: pulsars, active galactic nuclei, supernova remnants ? I review the wealth
of observational and theoretical work that have followed these detections, with
an emphasis on gamma-ray binaries. I present the current evidence that
gamma-ray binaries are driven by rotation-powered pulsars. Binaries are
laboratories giving access to different vantage points or physical conditions
on a regular timescale as the components revolve on their orbit. I explain the
basic ingredients that models of gamma-ray binaries use, the challenges that
they currently face, and how they can bring insights into the physics of
pulsars. I discuss how gamma-ray emission from microquasars provides a window
into the connection between accretion--ejection and acceleration, while eta Car
and novae raise new questions on the physics of these objects - or on the
theory of diffusive shock acceleration. Indeed, explaining the gamma-ray
emission from binaries strains our theories of high-energy astrophysical
processes, by testing them on scales and in environments that were generally
not foreseen, and this is how these detections are most valuable.

essential for thymocyte positive selection by regulating plasma-membrane
association of the protein tyrosine kinase Itk downstream of the T cell
receptor (TCR). IP4 can act as a soluble analog of the phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K) membrane lipid product phosphatidylinositol(3,4,5)trisphosphate
(PIP3). PIP3 recruits signaling proteins such as Itk to cellular membranes by
binding to PH and other domains. In thymocytes, low-dose IP4 binding to the Itk
PH domain surprisingly promoted and high-dose IP4 inhibited PIP3 binding of Itk
PH domains. However, the mechanisms that underlie the regulation of membrane
recruitment of Itk by IP4 and PIP3 remain unclear. The distinct Itk PH domain
ability to oligomerize is consistent with a cooperative-allosteric mode of IP4
action. However, other possibilities cannot be ruled out due to difficulties in
quantitatively measuring the interactions between Itk, IP4 and PIP3, and in
generating non-oligomerizing Itk PH domain mutants. This has hindered a full
mechanistic understanding of how IP4 controls Itk function. By combining
experimentally measured kinetics of PLC{\gamma}1 phosphorylation by Itk with in
silico modeling of multiple Itk signaling circuits and a maximum entropy
(MaxEnt) based computational approach, we show that those in silico models
which are most robust against variations of protein and lipid expression levels
and kinetic rates at the single cell level share a cooperative-allosteric mode
of Itk regulation by IP4 involving oligomeric Itk PH domains at the plasma
membrane. This identifies MaxEnt as an excellent tool for quantifying
robustness for complex TCR signaling circuits and provides testable predictions
to further elucidate a controversial mechanism of PIP3 signaling.

Landauer-B\""{u}ttiker conductance reaches the maximum
$G\simeq{}se^2/(\pi{h})\times{}W/L$ at the resonance via each LL, with the
prefactor varying from $s=8$ if all three degeneracies are preserved, to $s=1$
if all the degeneracies are split. In the absence of bias between the layers,
the degeneracies associated with spin and layer degrees of freedom may be split
by manipulating the doping and magnetic field; the conductance at the zeroth LL
is twice as large, while the conductance at any other LL equals to the
corresponding conductance of graphene monolayer. The presence of bias potential
allows one also to split the valley degeneracy. Our results show that the
charge transfer at each LL has pseudodiffusive character, with the second and
third cumulant quantified by ${\cal F}=1/3$ and ${\cal R}=1/15$ (respectively).
In case the electrochemical potential is allowed to slowly fluctuate in a

a starting point, we consider a homogeneous population, where each node has the

Fermi-Dirac functions. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we find the degree
distribution in steady state. In contrast to the well-known Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi
network, our degree distribution is not a Poisson distribution; yet its
behavior can be understood by an approximate theory. Next, we introduce a
second preferred degree network and couple it to the first by establishing a
controllable fraction of inter-group links. For this model, we find both
understandable and puzzling features. Generalizing the prediction for the
homogeneous population, we are able to explain the total degree distributions
well, but not the intra- or inter-group degree distributions. When monitoring
the total number of inter-group links, $X$, we find very surprising behavior.
$X$ explores almost the full range between its maximum and minimum allowed
values, resulting in a flat steady-state distribution, reminiscent of a simple
random walk confined between two walls. Both simulation results and analytic

inflation. In this paper we revisit four ways in which two-field scenarios can
behave differently from single field models; two-field slow-roll dynamics,
curvaton-type behaviour, inflation ending on an inhomogeneous hypersurface and
modulated reheating. We study the constraints that Planck data puts on these
classes of behaviour, focusing on the latter two which have been least studied
in the recent literature. We show that these latter classes are almost
equivalent, and extend their previous analyses by accounting for arbitrary
evolution of the isocurvature mode which, in particular, places important
limits on the Gaussian curvature of the reheating hypersurface. In general,
however, we find that Planck bispectrum results only constrain certain regions

topology to achieve minimum energy consumption and longer network lifetime. We
propose a cost function to select parent node or forwarder. Proposed cost
function selects a parent node which has high residual energy and minimum
distance to sink. Residual energy parameter balances the energy consumption
among the sensor nodes while distance parameter ensures successful packet
delivery to sink. Simulation results show that our proposed protocol maximize
the network stability period and nodes stay alive for longer period. Longer
stability period contributes high packet delivery to sink which is major
interest for continuous patient monitoring.

absorbers in our sample, with three of the systems being near-solar or
super-solar. We also investigate the effect of ionisation on the observed
abundances using photoionisation modelling. Combining our data with other
sub-DLA and DLA data from the literature, we report the most complete existing
determination of the metallicity vs. redshift relation for sub-DLAs and DLAs.
We confirm the suggestion from previous investigations that sub-DLAs are, on
average, more metal-rich than DLAs and evolve faster. We also discuss relative
abundances and abundance ratios in these absorbers. The more metal-rich systems
show significant dust depletion levels, as suggested by the ratios [Zn/Cr] and
[Zn/Fe]. For the majority of the systems in our sample, the [Mn/Fe] vs. [Zn/H]
trend is consistent with that seen previously for lower-redshift sub-DLAs. We
also measure the velocity width values for the sub-DLAs in our sample from
unsaturated absorption lines of Fe II 2344, 2374, 2600 A, and examine where
these systems lie in a plot of metallicity vs. velocity dispersion. Finally, we
examine cooling rate vs. H I column density in these sub-DLAs, and compare this
with the data from DLAs and the Milky Way ISM. We find that most of the systems
in our sample show higher cooling rate values compared to those seen in the
DLAs.

the inflationary background spacetime and conversion interactions between

a consequence, the primordial scalar power spectrum has a peak around the scale

considering dissipative gas and radial and azimuthal forcing, the outer regions
are marginally unstable to form spiral arms. Star formation is taking place in
spiral arms, which are regions of locally higher gas densities. Furthermore, we
have traced smooth exponential stellar disks over 3-orders of magnitude and 4-6
disk scale lengths, in spite of a highly variable gravitational instability
parameter. Thus, gravitational instability thresholds do not seem relevant to
the stellar disk. One possibility for creating an exponential disk is that the
molecular cloud densities and star formation rates have exponential profiles
and this forces the stellar disk to build up such a profile. Another
possibility is that the stellar disk is continuously adjusted to an exponential
shape regardless of the star formation profile, for example through global
dynamical process that scatter stars. However, such scattering processes are
only known to operate in spiral systems, in which case they cannot explain the

reveal any companion star hotter than early type A, {\it regardless of the

shorter periods than do $1\, M_\odot$ stars. Our data also suggest that the

(headstart) of the decision statistic. The particular problem addressed is that
of quickest detection of an abrupt change in the parameter of a discrete-time
exponential model. Both pre- and post-change parameter values are assumed
known, but the change-point is not known. For this change-point detection
scenario, we examine the performance of the conventional one-sided EWMA chart
with respect to two optimality criteria: Pollak's minimax criterion associated
with the maximal conditional expected delay to detection and Shiryaev's
multi-cyclic setup associated with the stationary expected delay to detection.
Using the integral-equations approach, we derive the exact closed-form formulae
for all of the required performance measures. Based on these formulae we find
the optimal smoothing factor and headstart by solving the corresponding two
bivariate constraint optimization problems. Finally, the performance of the
optimized EWMA chart is compared against that of the Shiryaev--Roberts--$r$
procedure in the minimax setting, and against that of the original
Shiryaev--Roberts procedure in the multi-cyclic setting. The main conclusion is
that the EWMA chart, when fully optimized, turns out to be a very competitive
procedure, with performance nearly indistinguishable from that of the
known-to-be-best Shiryaev--Roberts--$r$ and Shiryaev--Roberts procedures.

formation, metal line cooling, metallicity advection, and a recent
implementation of stellar feedback which encompasses OB-type stars radiative
pressure, photo-ionization heating, and supernovae. The initial conditions are
set to match the z~2 observations, thanks to a new public code DICE. The
numerical resolution allows us to follow the formation and evolution of giant
clumps formed in-situ from Jeans instabilities triggered by high initial gas

formation rate, which proceeds from the complex behavior of the giant clumps.
Our minor and major gas-rich merger simulations do not trigger starbursts,
suggesting a saturation of the star formation in a turbulent and clumpy
interstellar medium fed by substantial accretion from the circum-galactic

formation on a Schmidt-Kennicutt diagram. The mass-size relation and its rate

the observed Xmax distributions, is to reduce the transfer of energy from the
hadronic shower into the EM shower, by reducing the production or decay of
pi0s. We present four different models of new physics, each with a theoretical
rationale, which can accomplish this. One has a pure proton composition and
three have mixed composition. Two entail new particle physics and suppress pi0
production or decay above LHC energies. The other two are less radical but
nonetheless require significant modifications to existing hadron production
models -- in one the changes are only above LHC energies and in the other the
changes extend to much lower energies. We show that the models have
distinctively different predictions for the correlation between the number of
muons at ground and Xmax in hybrid events, so that with future hybrid data it
should be possible to discriminate between models of new physics and
disentangle the particle physics from composition.

of star formation, and molecular clouds, but can also tell us about the nature

results of recent simulations and observations. Galactic scale simulations are
beginning to examine in detail the evolution of GMCs as they form in spiral
arms, and then disperse by stellar feedback or shear. The overall timescale for
this process appears comparable to the crossing time of the GMCs, a few Myrs
for $10^5$ M$_{\odot}$ clouds, 20 Myr or so for more massive GMCs. Both
simulations and observations show that the massive clouds are found in the
spiral arms, likely as a result of cloud-cloud collisions. Simulations
including stars should also tell us about the stellar age distribution in GMCs,
and across spiral arms. More generally, recent work on spiral galaxies suggests
that the dynamics of gas flows in spiral arms are different in longlived and
transient spiral arms, resulting in different age patterns in the stars. Such
results could be used to help establish the main driver of spiral structure in
the Milky Way (Toomre instabilities, the bar, or nearby companion galaxies) in
conjunction with future surveys.

Line defects are generated from a framed BPS quiver by applying certain

instability, characterized by giant clumps whose fate is yet to be understood.
The main question is whether the clumps disrupt within their dynamical
timescale (<50Myr), like molecular clouds in today's galaxies, or whether they
survive stellar feedback for more than a disk orbital time (~300Myr) in which
case they can migrate inward and help building the central bulge. We present
3.5-7pc resolution AMR simulations of high-redshift disks including
photo-ionization, radiation pressure, and supernovae feedback (Renaud et al.
2013, and Perret et al., this astro-ph issue). Our modeling of radiation
pressure determines the mass loading and initial velocity of winds from basic
physical principles. We find that the giant clumps produce steady outflow rates
comparable to and sometimes somewhat larger than their star formation rate,
with velocities largely sufficient to escape galaxy. The clumps also lose mass,
especially old stars, by tidal stripping, and the stellar populations contained
in the clumps hence remain relatively young (<=200Myr), as observed. The clumps
survive gaseous outflows and stellar loss, because they are wandering in
gas-rich turbulent disks from which they can re-accrete gas at high rates
compensating for outflows and tidal stripping, overall keeping realistic and
self-regulated gaseous and stellar masses. Our simulations produce gaseous
outflows with velocities, densities and mass loading consistent with
observations, and at the same time suggest that the giant clumps survive for
hundreds of Myr and complete their migration to the center of high-redshift
galaxies, without rapid dispersion and reformation of clumps.

embedded in a turbulent, gravitating gas disk. The model combines a calculation
for the behavior of a group of grains encountering a single turbulent eddy,
with a hierarchical approximation of the eddy statistics. This makes analytic
predictions for a range of quantities including: distributions of grain
densities, power spectra and correlation functions of fluctuations, and maximum
grain densities reached. We predict how these scale as a function of grain drag
time t_stop, spatial scale, grain-to-gas mass ratio, strength of turbulence
(alpha), and detailed disk properties. We test these against numerical
simulations with various turbulence-driving mechanisms. The simulations agree
well with the predictions, spanning t_stop*Omega ~ 1e-4 - 10, alpha ~ 1e-10 -
1e-2, and grain-to-gas mass ratio ~0-3. Results from 'turbulent concentration'
simulations and laboratory experiments are also predicted as a special case.
Vortices on a wide range of scales disperse and concentrate grains
hierarchically. For small grains this is most efficient in eddies with turnover
time comparable to the stopping time, but fluctuations are also damped by local
gas-grain drift. For large grains, shear and gravity lead to a much broader
range of eddy scales driving fluctuations, with most power on the largest
scales. The grain density distribution has a log-Poisson shape, with
fluctuations for large grains up to factors >1000. We provide simple analytic

modern supernova and transient surveys. But very little is known about the
origin of these giant eruptions and their progenitors, many of which are
presumably very massive, evolved stars. Motivated by the small number of
progenitors positively associated with these giant eruptions, we have begun a
survey of the evolved massive star populations in nearby galaxies. The nearby,
nearly face on, giant spiral M101 is an excellent laboratory for studying a
large population of very massive stars. In this paper, we present BVI
photometry obtained from archival HST/ACS WFC images of M101. We have produced
a catalog of luminous stars with photometric errors <10% for V < 24.5 and 50%
completeness down to V ~ 26.5 even in regions of high stellar crowding. Using
color and luminosity criteria we have identified candidate luminous OB type
stars and blue supergiants, yellow supergiants, and red supergiants for future
observation. We examine their spatial distributions across the face of M101 and
find that the ratio of blue to red supergiants decreases by two orders of
magnitude over the radial extent of M101 corresponding to 0.5 dex in
metallicity. We discuss the resolved stellar content in the giant star forming
complexes NGC 5458, 5453, 5461, 5451, 5462, and 5449 and discuss their
color-magnitude diagrams in conjunction with the spatial distribution of the

annihilation in the Galaxy, particularly for light DM candidates in the
phenomenologically interesting O(10) GeV mass range. Especially from directions
close to the Galactic Plane, the expected gamma-ray spectrum is altered via two
effects: directly, by the photons emitted in the bremsstrahlung process on the
interstellar gas by energetic electrons which are among the DM annihilation
byproducts; indirectly, by the modification of the same electron spectrum, due
to the additional energy loss process in the diffusion-loss equation (e.g. the
resulting inverse Compton emission is altered). We quantify the importance of
the bremsstrahlung emission in the GeV energy range, showing that it is the
dominant component of the gamma-ray spectrum for some cases. We also find that,
in regions in which bremsstrahlung dominates energy losses, the related
gamma-ray emission is only moderately sensitive to possible large variations in
the gas density. Still, we stress that, for computing precise spectra in the
(sub-)GeV range, it is important to obtain a reliable description of the inner
Galaxy gas distribution as well as to compute self-consistently the gamma
emission and the solution to the diffusion-loss equation. For example, these
are crucial issues to quantify and interpret meaningfully gamma-ray map
`residuals' in terms of (light) DM annihilations.

(gSR) presented in Ettori et al. (2012) is here discussed. We extend further
the formalism of the gSR in the self-similar model for X-ray galaxy clusters,
showing that for a generic relation M_tot ~ L^a M_g^b T^c, where L, M_g and T
are the gas luminosity, mass and temperature, respectively, the values of the
slopes lay in the plane 4*a+3*b+2*c=3. Using published dataset, we show that
some projections of the gSR are the most efficient relations, holding among
observed physical X-ray quantities, to recover the cluster mass. This
conclusion is based on the evidence that they provide the lowest chi^2, the
lowest total scatter and the lowest intrinsic scatter among the studied scaling
laws on both galaxy group and cluster mass scales. By the application of the
gSR, the intrinsic scatter is reduced in all the cases down to a relative error
on M_tot below 16 per cent. The best-fit relations are: M_tot ~ M_g^a
T^{1.5-1.5a}, with a~0.4, and M_tot ~ L^a T^{1.5-2a}, with a~0.15. As a by
product of this study, we provide the estimates of the gravitating mass at
Delta=500 for 120 objects (50 from the Mahdavi et al. 2013 sample, 16 from
Maughan 2012; 31 from Pratt et al. 2009; 23 from Sun et al. 2009), 114 of which
are unique entries. The typical relative error in the mass provided from the
gSR only (i.e. not propagating any uncertainty associated with the observed
quantities) ranges between 3-5 per cent on cluster scale and is about 10 per
cent for galaxy groups. With respect to the hydrostatic values used to
calibrate the gSR, the masses are recovered with deviations in the order of 10
per cent due to the different mix of relaxed/disturbed objects present in the
considered samples. In the extreme case of a gSR calibrated with relaxed
systems, the hydrostatic mass in disturbed objects is over-estimated by about
20 per cent.

resonances with planets. While all the trojans in our Solar System are small (<
~100 km), stable planet-size trojans may exist in extrasolar planetary systems,
and the Kepler telescope constitutes a formidable tool to search for them. Here
we report on a systematic search for extrasolar trojan companions to 2244 known
Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs), with epicyclic orbital characteristics
similar to those of the Jovian trojan families. No convincing trojan candidates
are found, despite a typical sensitivity down to Earth-size objects. This fact
can however not be used to stringently exclude the existence of trojans in this
size range, since stable trojans need not necessarily share the same orbital
plane as the planet, and thus may not transit. Following this reasoning, we
note that if Earth-sized trojans exist at all, they are almost certainly both
present and in principle detectable in the full set of Kepler data, although a
very substantial computational effort would be required to detect them. On the
same token, we also note that some of the existing KOIs could in principle be
trojans themselves, with a primary planet orbiting outside of the transiting
plane. A few examples are given for which this is a readily testable scenario.

reliability mechanisms based on ARQ and FEC. The question we ask is which
mechanism is more suitable for an HSN in which the scalability of reliable data
transfer in terms of receiver's buffer requirement and achievable delay and
throughput is a concern. To efficiently utilize the large bandwidth available
to a connection in an HSN, sliding window protocols require a large
transmission window. In this regime of large transmission windows, we show that
while both mechanisms achieve the same asymptotic throughput in the presence of
packet losses, their delay and buffer requirements are different. Specifically,
an FEC-based mechanism has delay and receiver's buffer requirement that are
asymptotically smaller than that of an ARQ-based selective repeat mechanism by
a factor of log W, where W is the window size of the selective repeat
mechanism. This result is then used to investigate the implications of each
reliability mechanism on protocol design in an HSN in terms of throughput,

and narrow transport channel between two electron reservoirs. In clean channels
electron transport is ballistic and the conductance $G$ is then quantised as a
function of channel width with plateaus at integer multiples of $2e^2/h$ ($e$
is the electron charge and $h$ Planck's constant). This can be understood in a
picture where the electron states are propagating waves, without need to
account for electron-electron interactions. Quantised conductance could thus be
the signature of ultimate control over nanoscale electron transport. However,
even studies with the cleanest QPCs generically show significant anomalies on
the quantised conductance traces and there is consensus that these result from
electron many-body effects. Despite extensive experimental and theoretical
studies understanding of these anomalies is an open problem. We report evidence
that the many-body effects have their origin in one or more spontaneously
localised states that emerge from Friedel oscillations in the QPC channel.
Kondo physics will then also contribute to the formation of the many-body state
with Kondo signatures that reflect the parity of the number of localised
states. Evidence comes from experiments with length-tunable QPCs that show a
periodic modulation of the many-body physics with Kondo signatures of
alternating parity. Our results are of importance for assessing the role of
QPCs in more complex hybrid devices and proposals for spintronic and quantum
information applications. In addition, our results show that tunable QPCs offer
a rich platform for investigating many-body effects in nanoscale systems, with
the ability to probe such physics at the level of a single site.

Galaxy Survey (VGS) inside a large void in the SDSS galaxy redshift survey. HI
data revealed these galaxies to be embedded in a common elongated envelope,
possibly embedded in intravoid filament. In the CosmoGrid simulation we look
for systems similar to VGS_31 in mass, size and environment. We find a total of
eight such systems. For these systems, we study the distribution of neighbour
haloes, the assembly and evolution of the main haloes and the dynamical
evolution of the haloes, as well as the evolution of the large-scale structure
in which the systems are embedded. The spatial distribution of the haloes
follows that of the dark matter environment. We find that VGS_31-like systems
have a large variation in formation time, having formed between 10 Gyr ago and
the present epoch. However, the environments in which the systems are embedded
evolved resemble each other substantially. Each of the VGS_31-like systems is
embedded in an intra-void wall, that no later than z = 0.5 became the only
prominent feature in its environment. While part of the void walls retain a
rather featureless character, we find that around half of them are marked by a
pronounced and rapidly evolving substructure. Five haloes find themselves in a
tenuous filament of a few Mpc/h long inside the intra-void wall. Finally, we
compare the results to observed data from VGS_31. Our study implies that the
VGS_31 galaxies formed in the same (proto)filament, and did not meet just
recently. The diversity amongst the simulated halo systems indicates that
VGS_31 may not be typical for groups of galaxies in voids.

nonlocal response. Furthermore, an effective theory is developed to explain the

to pass through these points during their orbital motion in magnetic field,
because they must turn sharply. As the area of the Fermi surface affected by

relay location within a cell. Existing results for optimal relay placement do
not reflect how the radio propagation environment and choice of the coding
scheme can impact system performance. In this paper, we analyze the impact on
relaying performance of node distances, relay height and line-of-sight
conditions for both uplink and downlink transmissions, using several relay
coding schemes. Our first objective is to propose a geometrical model for
energy-efficient relay placement that requires only a small number of
characteristic distances. Our second objective is to estimate the maximum cell
coverage of a relay-aided cell given power constraints, and conversely, the
averaged energy consumption given a cell radius. We show that the practical
full decode-forward scheme performs close to the energy-optimized partial
decode-forward scheme when the relay is ideally located. However, away from
this optimum relay location, performance rapidly degrades and more advanced
coding scheme, such as partial decode-forward, is needed to maintain good
performance and allow more freedom in the relay placement. Finally, we define a
trade-off between cell coverage and energy efficiency, and show that there
exists a relay location for which increasing the cell coverage has a minimal

branching ratios $Br$ and CP violating rate differences $\Delta_{CP} = \Gamma -
\overline{\Gamma}$ satisfy, $Br(\pi^+\pi^+\pi^-) = 2Br(\pi^+ K^+ K^-)$,
$Br(K^+K^+K^-) = 2 Br(K^+\pi^+\pi^-)$, and $\Delta_{CP}(\pi^+\pi^+\pi^-) =
2\Delta_{CP}(\pi^+ K^+K^-) = - \Delta_{CP}(K^+K^+K^-) =
-2\Delta_{CP}(K^+\pi^+\pi^-)$. The experimental data do not exhibit the
expected pattern for the branching ratios. The rate differences for $B^+\to
\pi^+\pi^+\pi^-$ and $B^+\to K^+ K^+ K^-$ satisfy the relation between $\Delta
S =0$ and $\Delta S=1$ well, but the other two do not, with the CP asymmetries
having different signs than expected. In this work we study how to including
momentum dependent and also $SU(3)$ breaking effects on these decays to explain
experimental data. We find that only including lowest order derivative terms,
in the $SU(3)$ limit, the decay patterns cannot be explained. Large $SU(3)$
breaking effects are needed to explain the data.

less constrained from LHC searches than models with a Majorana gluino. In this
paper, we generalize this discussion to models with a ""Mixed Gluino"", that
acquires both Dirac and Majorana masses, as well as models in which electroweak
gauginos contribute to squark production. Our primary interest is the degree of
suppression of the cross section for first generation squarks compared with a
gluino with a pure Majorana mass. We find that not all Majorana masses are
alike -- a Majorana mass for the gluino can suppress the squark production
cross section, whereas a Majorana mass for the adjoint fermion partner leads to
an increased cross section, compared with a pure Dirac gluino. In the presence
of electroweak gauginos, squark production can increase by at most a factor of
a few above the pure Dirac gluino case when the electroweak gauginos have
purely Majorana masses near to the squark masses. This unusual set of gaugino
masses is interesting since the usual Higgs quartic coupling would not be
suppressed. When the electroweak gaugino masses are much lighter than the
squarks, there is a negligible change to the squark production cross section.
We explain both of these cases in detail by considering the various
subprocesses for squark production at the LHC. Continued searches for squark
production with cross sections much smaller than expected in the MSSM are
absolutely warranted, and we suggest new simplified models to fully
characterize the collider constraints.

homogenous models of the environment (constant density) predict X-ray columns
similar to those found in the optical spectra, with the bulk of the opacity
being produced by neutral material at large distances from the burst. This
result is independent of gas density or metallicity. Only models assuming a
progenitor immersed in a dense (10^(2-4) cm-3) cloud of gas (with radius ~10
pc), with a strong, declining gradient of density for the surrounding
interstellar medium are able to account for the large X-ray to optical column
density ratios. However, to avoid an unphysical correlation between the size of
this cloud, and the size of the ionization front produced by the GRB, the
models also require that the circumburst medium is already ionized prior to the
burst. The inferred cloud masses are <10^6 M_solar, even if low metallicities
in the medium are assumed (Z~0.1 Z_solar). These cloud properties are
consistent with those found in giant molecular clouds and our results support a
scenario in which the progenitors reside within intense star formation regions
of galaxies. Finally, we show that modeling over large samples of GRB

important step towards understanding how they influence important
organismal-level traits, or ""phenotypes"", including human disease
susceptibility. To this end scientists are undertaking large-scale genetic
association studies that aim to identify genetic variants associated with
molecular and cellular phenotypes, such as gene expression, transcription
factor binding, or chromatin accessibility. These studies use high-throughput
sequencing assays (e.g. RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, DNase-seq) to obtain high-resolution
data on how the traits vary along the genome in each sample. However, typical
association analyses fail to exploit these high-resolution measurements,
instead aggregating the data at coarser resolutions, such as genes, or windows
of fixed length. Here we develop and apply statistical methods that better
exploit the high-resolution data. The key idea is to treat the sequence data as
measuring an underlying ""function"" that varies along the genome, and then,
building on wavelet-based methods for functional data analysis, test for
association between genetic variants and the underlying function. Applying
these methods to identify genetic variants associated with chromatin
accessibility (dsQTLs) we find that they identify substantially more
associations than a simpler window-based analysis, and in total we identify 772
novel dsQTLs not identified by the original analysis.

topological insulators characterized by an integer Hopf index. To demonstrate
the existence and physical relevance of the Hopf insulators, we construct a

topologically protected surface states and we numerically demonstrate the
robustness of these topologically protected states under general random

(RCI) precoding by performing a large-system analysis that combines tools from

probability of secrecy outage and the mean secrecy rate, and characterize
regimes where RCI precoding achieves a nonzero secrecy rate. We find that
unlike isolated cells, the secrecy rate in a cellular network does not grow
monotonically with the transmit power, and the network tends to be in secrecy
outage if the transmit power grows unbounded. Furthermore, we show that there
is an optimal value for the base station deployment density that maximizes the

new bounds and generalized error expansion we establish. One of them is similar
to the residual norm of an approximate solution of the linear system, and the
other one is determined critically by the first term of the error expansion of
the Arnoldi approximation to $e^{-\tau A}v$ due to Saad. We prove that each of
the two estimates is reliable to measure the true error norm, and the second
one theoretically justifies an empirical claim by Saad. In the paper, by
introducing certain functions $\phi_k(z)$ defined recursively by the given
function $f(z)$ for certain nodes, we obtain the error expansion of the
Krylov-like approximation for $f(z)$ sufficiently smooth, which generalizes
Saad's result on the Arnoldi approximation to $e^{-\tau A}v$. Similarly, it is
shown that the first term of the generalized error expansion can be used as a
reliable a posteriori estimate for the Krylov-like approximation to some other
matrix functions times $v$. Numerical examples are reported to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the a posteriori error estimates for the Krylov-like

Examples of these problems include identification of conserved functional
components (biochemical interactions) across species, structural similarity of
large biomolecules, and recurring patterns of interactions in social networks.
A large class of such analyses methods quantify the topological similarity of
nodes across networks. The resulting correspondence of nodes across networks,
also called node alignment, can be used to identify invariant subgraphs across
the input graphs.
  Given $k$ graphs as input, alignment algorithms use topological information
to assign a similarity score to each $k$-tuple of nodes, with elements (nodes)
drawn from each of the input graphs. Nodes are considered similar if their
neighbors are also similar. An alternate, equivalent view of these network
alignment algorithms is to consider the Kronecker product of the input graphs,
and to identify high-ranked nodes in the Kronecker product graph. Conventional
methods such as PageRank and HITS (Hypertext Induced Topic Selection) can be
used for this purpose. These methods typically require computation of the
principal eigenvector of a suitably modified Kronecker product matrix of the
input graphs. We adopt this alternate view of the problem to address the
problem of multiple network alignment. Using the phase estimation algorithm, we
show that the multiple network alignment problem can be efficiently solved on
quantum computers. We characterize the accuracy and performance of our method,
and show that it can deliver exponential speedups over conventional
(non-quantum) methods.

variations were detected at a 3\sigma level in 11 pulsars, four of which were
above 5\sigma: PSRs J0835-4510, J0908-4913, J1824-1945, and J1833-0827. We find
that after 28 years of gradual decline, the DM of PSR J0835-4510 is now
increasing. The magnitude of variations in three of the four (PSRs J0835-4510,
J0908-4913, and J1833-0827) are above what models would predict for an ISM
dominated by Kolmogorov turbulence. We attribute this excess as likely due to
the pulsar's local environment - the supernova remnants near PSRs J0835-4510

were determined for all pulsars without detectable values of dDM/dt, most

any binary-input memoryless output-symmetric channel. One of the few drawbacks
of the original polar code construction is that it is not universal. This means
that the code has to be tailored to the channel if we want to transmit close to
capacity.
  We present two ""polar-like"" schemes which are capable of achieving the
compound capacity of the whole class of binary-input memoryless
output-symmetric channels with low complexity.
  Roughly speaking, for the first scheme we stack up $N$ polar blocks of length
$N$ on top of each other but shift them with respect to each other so that they
form a ""staircase."" Coding then across the columns of this staircase with a
standard Reed-Solomon code, we can achieve the compound capacity using a
standard successive decoder to process the rows (the polar codes) and in
addition a standard Reed-Solomon erasure decoder to process the columns.
Compared to standard polar codes this scheme has essentially the same
complexity per bit but a block length which is larger by a factor $O(N
\log_2(N)/\epsilon)$, where $\epsilon$ is the gap to capacity.
  For the second scheme we first show how to construct a true polar code which
achieves the compound capacity for a finite number of channels. We achieve this
by introducing special ""polarization"" steps which ""align"" the good indices for
the various channels. We then show how to exploit the compactness of the space
of binary-input memoryless output-symmetric channels to reduce the compound
capacity problem for this class to a compound capacity problem for a finite set
of channels. This scheme is similar in spirit to standard polar codes, but the
price for universality is a considerably larger blocklength.
  We close with what we consider to be some interesting open problems.

functional theory of water [G. Jeanmairet et al., J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 4, 619,

angstroms to nanometers. The theory is based on the quadratic expansion of the
excess free energy in terms of two classical density fields, the particle
density and the multipolar polarization density. Its implementation requires as
input a molecular model of water and three measurable bulk properties, namely
the structure factor and the k-dependent longitudinal and transverse dielectric
susceptibilities. The fine three-dimensional water structure around small
hydrophobic molecules is found to be well reproduced. In contrast the computed
solvation free-energies appear overestimated and do not exhibit the correct
qualitative behavior when the hydrophobic solute is grown in size. These
shortcomings are corrected, in the spirit of the Lum-Chandler-Weeks theory, by
complementing the functional with a truncated hard-sphere functional acting
beyond quadratic order in density. It makes the resulting functional compatible
with the Van-der-Waals theory of liquid-vapor coexistence at long range.
Compared to available molecular simulations, the approach yields reasonable
solvation structure and free energy of hard or soft spheres of increasing size,
with a correct qualitative transition from a volume-driven to a surface-driven
regime at the nanometer scale.

classify this data for subtle underlying features and make useful predictions.
  This paper presents financial examples in which we learn from data and then
proceed to classify fresh streams. The classification is based on features of
streams that are specified through the coordinates of the signature of the
path. At a mathematical level the signature is a faithful transform of a

During observations, the magnetic flux was emerging in the active region and
also in the plage regions. The flux emergence was stopped in West-most
footpoint of the plage region about an hour before the filament eruption. A
converging motion was also observed for many hours in the Western footpoint of

the Wilson Dirac operator via Random Matrix Theory including the three leading

we consider the limit of small and large (which is almost the mean field limit)

present some quantities which can be easily used for comparison of lattice data

strongly interacting electron and phonon fields acknowledged in lightly doped
cuprates to interpret broad bands in their ARPES and optical conductivity
spectra influences the carrier distribution function as charge carrier momentum
is no longer certain. We develop appropriate distribution and use it to
calculate the carrier concentration in different states in essentially doped
systems with SBTS. This allows studying doping and temperature evolution of
ARPES spectra of such systems. We reveal that at increasing both temperature or
doping polarons concede dominance to bipolarons that results in a shift of the
broad band maximum to higher binding energy as it occurs in ARPES spectra of
cuprates. At further doping delocalized carriers appear and coexist with
bipolarons. We show that intimate property of systems with SBTS is partition of
the momentum space between autolocalized and delocalized carriers caused by
Pauli exclusion rule. We demonstrate that in ARPES spectra such partition
manifests itself as `vertical dispersion` or waterfalls universally observed in
all the cuprates at essential doping and in undoped parent compounds. Thus,
studying the carriers distribution in systems where electron-phonon interaction
breaks the translation symmetry leads simultaneously to both types of
waterfalls observed in significantly doped and undoped cuprates. The article

As the transmission maxima occurs spectrally close to the absorption resonances

Here, a theoretical study on Absorption Induced Transparency is presented. The
results show that the appearance of transmission maxima requires that the
absorbent fills the holes and that it occurs also for single holes.
Furthermore, it is shown that the transmission process is non-resonant, being
composed by a sequential passage of the EM field through the hole. Finally, the
physical origin of the phenomenon is demonstrated to be non-plasmonic, which
implies that Absorption Induced Transparency should also occur at the infrared

moment $\mu_B$ of electrons. For simplicity, temperature and chemical potential
are equal to zero throughout the paper. We compare in the framework of the
model the above mentioned phenomena both at $\mu_B=0$ and $\mu_B\ne 0$. It is
shown that at $\mu_B\ne 0$ the magnetic catalysis effect is drastically changed
in comparison with the $\mu_B= 0$ case. Namely, at $\mu_B\ne 0$ the chiral
symmetry, being spontaneously broken by $\vec B$ at subcritical coupling
constants, is always restored at $|\vec B|\to\infty$ (even at $\vec
B_\parallel=0$). Moreover, it is proved in this case that chiral symmetry can
be restored simply by tilting $\vec B$ to a system plane, and in the region $
B_\perp\to 0$ the de Haas -- van Alphen oscillations of the magnetization are
observed. At supercritical values of coupling constant we have found two
chirally non-invariant phases which respond differently on the action of $\vec
B$. The first (at rather small values of $|\vec B|$) is a diamagnetic phase, in
which there is an enhancement of chiral condensate, whereas the second is a
paramagnetic chirally broken phase. Numerical estimates show that phase
transitions described in the paper can be achieved at low enough laboratory
magnetic fields.

the number of hops $K$, and 3) the degree of spatial correlations. The
randomness in both $N_j$'s and $K$ is advantageous, i.e., it can yield larger

  fits","Accepted to A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201322077",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sub-millimetre dust emission is an important tracer of density N of dense
interstellar clouds. One has to combine surface brightness information at
different spatial resolutions, and specific methods are needed to derive N at a
resolution higher than the lowest resolution of the observations. Some methods
have been discussed in the literature, including a method (in the following,
method B) that constructs the N estimate in stages, where the smallest spatial
scales being derived only use the shortest wavelength maps. We propose simple
model fitting as a flexible way to estimate high-resolution column density
maps. Our goal is to evaluate the accuracy of this procedure and to determine
whether it is a viable alternative for making these maps. The new method
consists of model maps of column density (or intensity at a reference
wavelength) and colour temperature. The model is fitted using Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, comparing model predictions with observations at
their native resolution. We analyse simulated surface brightness maps and
compare its accuracy with method B and the results that would be obtained using
high-resolution observations without noise. The new method is able to produce
reliable column density estimates at a resolution significantly higher than the
lowest resolution of the input maps. Compared to method B, it is relatively
resilient against the effects of noise. The method is computationally more
demanding, but is feasible even in the analysis of large Herschel maps. The
proposed empirical modelling method E is demonstrated to be a good alternative
for calculating high-resolution column density maps, even with considerable
super-resolution. Both methods E and B include the potential for further
improvements, e.g., in the form of better a priori constraints.

and its interaction with medium are constituted by the Einstein's theory of
photo-effect and the theory of Compton effect. However, in the theory proposed
by Compton and subsequent refinements, the medium features in explicit form are
not generally accounted at all. This theory is based on the relationship
between the photon momentum and its energy that may take place only in vacuum,
but not in a medium with non-unity refractive index n. Here, we use Abraham's
representation for the momentum of a photon in medium for the creation of a new
consistent Compton effect theory accounting for media features. A new condition
under which anomalous Compton effect is possible, is defined. In our case, due
to the photon scattering on a moving electron, the photon's energy can increase
when the electron velocity is above a threshold value, in analogy with the
Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation effect. In our theory we also provide a new
description of the parameters for scattered electrons, which is important for
the experimental determination of the dependence of the Compton effect in
medium on refractive index n.

  Lyme Disease",,,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto is a bacterial spirochete prevalent in the
Northeastern United States that causes Lyme disease. Lyme disease is the most
common arthropod-borne disease in the United States; affecting mice, deer,
humans and other mammals. The disease is spread by Ixodes Scapularis, a species
of tick whose primary food source are deer and mice. Reducing the population of
ticks feeding on both large and small mammals below some critical threshold can
decrease the prevalence of Lyme disease among humans. A simplified,
six-dimensional Susceptible-Infected, SI, model is used to capture the
mice-deer-tick dynamics while considering the impact of varying
population-specific death rates on infected population size. We analyzed the
stability of the models two equilibria, the unstable disease free equilibrium
and the endemic equilibrium. Static forward sensitivity analysis is conducted
on the basic reproduction number and the endemic equilibrium. A dynamic
approach was explored to observe change in the sensitivity of the death rates
over time. These analyses were conducted to determine the efficacy of changing
death rates in order to reduce prevalence of Lyme disease.

  United States",,,,,"q-bio.OT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Vicodin is the most commonly prescribed pain reliever in the United States.
Research indicates that there are two million people who are currently abusing
Vicodin, and the majority of those who abuse Vicodin were initially exposed to
it via prescription. Our goal is to determine the most effective strategies for
reducing the overall population of Vicodin abusers. More specifically, we focus
on whether prevention methods aimed at educating doctors and patients on the
potential for drug abuse or treatment methods implemented after a person abuses
Vicodin will have a greater overall impact. We consider one linear and two
non-linear compartmental models in which medical users of Vicodin can
transition into the abuser compartment or leave the population by no longer
taking the drug. Once Vicodin abusers, people can transition into a treatment
compartment, with the possibility of leaving the population through successful
completion of treatment or of relapsing and re-entering the abusive
compartment. The linear model assumes no social interaction, while both
non-linear models consider interaction. One considers interaction with abusers
affecting the relapse rate, while the other assumes both this and an additional
interaction between the number of abusers and the number of new prescriptions.
Sensitivity analyses are conducted varying the rates of success of these
intervention methods measured by the parameters to determine which strategy has
the greatest impact on controlling the population of Vicodin abusers. From
these models and analyses, we determine that manipulating parameters tied to
prevention measures has a greater impact on reducing the population of abusers
than manipulating parameters associated with treatment. We also note that
increasing the rate at which abusers seek treatment affects the population of
abusers more than the success rate of treatment itself.

the introduction of non-native invasive species of plants, animals, or
pathogens associated with travel and international trade. Such invasive species
often have no natural enemies in their new regions. The spatiotemporal dynamics
related to the invasion/spread of Nylanderia fulva, commonly known as the
Rasberry crazy ant, are explored via the use of models that focus on the
reproduction of ant colonies. A Cellular Automaton (CA) simulates the spatially
explicit spread of ants on a grid. The impact of local spatial correlations on
the dynamics of invasion is investigated numerically and analytically with the
aid of a Mean Field (MF) model and a Pair Approximation (PA) model, the latter
of which accounts for adjacent cell level efects. The PA model approach
considers the limited mobility range of N. fulva, that is, the grid cell
dynamics are not strongly in uenced by non-adjacent cells. The model determines
the rate of growth of colonies of N. fulva under distinct cell spatial
architecture. Numerical results and qualitative conclusions on the spread and
control of this invasive ant species are discussed.

harmonic oscillators in R with completely decentralized nearest neighbor
interaction. We then use the theory to establish that in a certain range of the
parameters transients grow linearly in the number of agents (and faster outside
that range). Finally, in the regime where this linear growth occurs we give the
constant of proportionality as a function of the signal velocities (see [3]) in
each of the two directions. As corollaries we show that symmetric interactions
are far from optimal and that all these results independent of (reasonable)

globular clusters, and the period-luminosity relation they show at
near-infrared wavelengths, can help enormously in providing accurate distances

statistical viewpoint, little work has attempted to quantify the extent to
which this phenomenon affects the evaluation of computer vision (CV) object
detection algorithms. Many researchers utilise ground truth (GT) in experiments
and more often than not this GT is derived from one annotator's opinion. How
does the difference in opinion affect an algorithm's evaluation? Four examples
of typical CV problems are chosen, and a methodology is applied to each to
quantify the inter-annotator variance and to offer insight into the mechanisms
behind agreement and the use of GT. It is found that when detecting linear
objects annotator agreement is very low. The agreement in object position,
linear or otherwise, can be partially explained through basic image properties.
Automatic object detectors are compared to annotator agreement and it is found
that a clear relationship exists. Several methods for calculating GTs from a
number of annotations are applied and the resulting differences in the
performance of the object detectors are quantified. It is found that the rank
of a detector is highly dependent upon the method used to form the GT. It is
also found that although the STAPLE and LSML GT estimation methods appear to
represent the mean of the performance measured using the individual
annotations, when there are few annotations, or there is a large variance in
them, these estimates tend to degrade. Furthermore, one of the most commonly
adopted annotation combination methods--consensus voting--accentuates more
obvious features, which results in an overestimation of the algorithm's
performance. Finally, it is concluded that in some datasets it may not be
possible to state with any confidence that one algorithm outperforms another
when evaluating upon one GT and a method for calculating confidence bounds is
discussed.

repulsive contact forces, such as granular media and colloidal suspensions. We
identify and characterize two distinct classes of behavior as a function of the
input kinetic energy per degree of freedom $T_0$ and packing fraction deviation
above and below jamming onset $\Delta \phi=\phi - \phi_J$ using numerical
simulations of purely repulsive frictionless disks. Iso-coordinated solids
(ICS) only occur above jamming for $\Delta \phi > \Delta \phi_c(T_0)$; they
possess average coordination number equal to the isostatic value ($< z> =
z_{\rm iso}$) required for mechanically stable packings. ICS display harmonic
vibrational response, where the density of vibrational modes from the Fourier
transform of the velocity autocorrelation function is a set of sharp peaks at
eigenfrequencies $\omega_k^d$ of the dynamical matrix evaluated at $T_0=0$.
Hypo-coordinated solids (HCS) occur both above and below jamming onset within
the region defined by $\Delta \phi > \Delta \phi^*_-(T_0)$, $\Delta \phi <
\Delta \phi^*_+(T_0)$, and $\Delta \phi > \Delta \phi_{cb}(T_0)$. In this
region, the network of interparticle contacts fluctuates with $< z> \approx
z_{\rm iso}/2$, but cage-breaking particle rearrangements do not occur. The HCS
vibrational response is nonharmonic, {\it i.e} the density of vibrational modes
$D(\omega)$ is not a collection of sharp peaks at $\omega_k^d$, and its precise
form depends on the measurement method. For $\Delta \phi > \Delta
\phi_{cb}(T_0)$ and $\Delta \phi < \Delta \phi^*_{-}(T_0)$, the system behaves
as a hard-particle liquid.

  Because the stars in the eclipsing binary are near the cluster turnoff, they
are evolving rapidly in size and are sensitive to age. With a metallicity of
[Fe/H]=+0.09+/-0.03, we find the age of NGC 6819 to be about 2.4 Gyr from CMD
isochrone fitting and 3.1+/-0.4 Gyr by analyzing the mass-radius (M-R) data for
this binary. The M-R age is above previous determinations for this cluster, but
consistent within 1 sigma uncertainties. When the M-R data for the primary star
of the additional cluster binary WOCS 23009 is included, the weighted age
estimate drops to 2.5+/-0.2 Gyr, with a systematic uncertainty of at least 0.2

raised the question if energy-only power markets are increasingly failing due
to growing feed-in shares from subsidized renewable energy sources (RES). The
short answer to this is: No, they are not failing. Energy-based power markets
are, however, facing several market distortions, namely from the gap between
the electricity volume traded at day-ahead markets versus the overall
electricity consumption as well as the (wrong) regulatory assumption that
variable RES generation, i.e., wind and photovoltaic (PV), truly have zero
marginal operation costs. In this paper we show that both effects over-amplify
the well-known merit-order effect of RES power feed-in beyond a level that is
explainable by underlying physical realities, i.e., thermal power plants being
willing to accept negative electricity prices to be able to stay online due to
considerations of wear & tear and start-stop constraints. We analyze the
impacts of wind and PV power feed-in on the day-ahead market for a region that
is already today experiencing significant feed-in tariff (FIT)-subsidized RES
power feed-in, the EPEX German-Austrian market zone ($\approx\,$20% FIT share).
Our analysis shows that, if the necessary regulatory adaptations are taken,
i.e., increasing the day-ahead market's share of overall load demand and using
the true marginal costs of RES units in the merit-order, energy-based power
markets can remain functional despite high RES power feed-in.

sparsifies the state vectors, i.e., it represents them using vectors with few
non-zero components, and as a result, the systems might need to transmit only a
fraction of the original information to be able to recover the non-zero
components of the transformed state vector. Hence, the estimator can recover
the state vector of the system from an under-determined linear set of
equations. We use a greedy search algorithm to calculate the sparsifying basis.
Then, we present an upper bound for the estimation error. Finally, we
demonstrate the results on a numerical example.

great impact on the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model
(MSSM). In the context of the constrained MSSM (CMSSM) and its extension with
non-universal masses for the MSSM Higgs doublets (NUHM2), sparticles with
masses $ > 1$ TeV are necessary to reproduce the observed Higgs boson mass of
125-126 GeV. On the other hand, there appears to be a significant amount of
discrepancy between the measured muon $g-2$ and the Standard Model prediction.
A successful explanation of this discrepancy in the MSSM requires new
contributions involving relatively light sparticles with masses $ < 1$ TeV. In
this paper, we attempt to accommodate the two conflicting requirements in an
SU(5) inspired extension of the CMSSM. We assign non-universal but flavor blind
soft supersymmetry breaking masses to the scalar components in $\bar 5$ and 10
matter supermultiplets. The two MSSM Higgs doublets in the 5, $\bar5$
representations of SU(5) are also assigned unequal soft mass$^2$ at $M_{GUT}$.
We identify parameter regions which can simultaneously accommodate the observed
Higgs boson mass and the muon $g-2$ data, and which are compatible with other
phenomenological constraints such as neutralino dark matter relic abundance and
rare B-meson decays. Some regions of the allowed parameter space will be
explored at the upgraded LHC and by dark matter direct detection experiments.

identical inertial particles suspended in randomly mixing and turbulent flows.
Our results are obtained by matching asymptotic forms of the distribution. The
method takes into account spatial clustering of the suspended particles as well
as singularities in their motion (so-called 'caustics'). It thus takes proper
account of the fractal properties of phase space and the distribution is
characterised in terms of the corresponding phase-space fractal dimension D_2.
The method clearly exhibits universal aspects of the distribution (independent
of the statistical properties of the flow): at small particle separations R and
not too large radial relative speeds |V_R|, the distribution of radial relative
velocities exhibits a universal power-law form \rho(V_R,R) \sim |V_R|^{D_2-d-1}
provided that D_2 < d+1 (d is the spatial dimension) and that the Stokes number
St is large enough for caustics to form. The range in V_R over which this power
law is valid depends on R, on the Stokes number, and upon the nature of the
flow. Our results are in good agreement with results of computer simulations of
the dynamics of particles suspended in random velocity fields with finite
correlation times. In the white-noise limit the results are consistent with
those of [Gustavsson and Mehlig, Phys. Rev. E84 (2011) 045304].

below a critical threshold, entanglement always leads to enhanced precision,

from the center of M31 along opposite sides of its minor axis. The ensemble of
these two distant PNe plus 16 similarly luminous outer-disk PNe published
earlier (Kwitter et al. 2012 & 2013) forms a homogeneous group in luminosity,
metal content, progenitor mass, age, and kinematics. The main factual findings
of our work are: (1) O/H (and other low-mass alpha elements and their ratios to
O) is uniformly solar-like in all 18 PNe <12+log(O/H)> = 8.62 +/- 0.14); (2)
the general sky distribution and kinematics of the ensemble much more closely
resemble the rotation pattern of the classical disk of M31 than its halo or
bulge; (3) the O/H gradient is surprisingly flat beyond R_g ~30 kpc, and may be
flat throughout the entire range of R_g covered in the full study. The PNe are
too metal-rich to be bona fide members of M31's disk or halo, and (4) the
abundance patterns of the sample are distinct from those in the spiral galaxies
M33, M81, and NGC 300. Using standard PN age diagnostic methods (which are
readily challengeable) we suggest that all of the PNe formed -2 GY ago in a
starburst of metal-rich ISM that followed an M31-M33 encounter about 3 GY ago.
We review supporting evidence from stellar studies. Other more prosaic
explanations, such as dwarf galaxy assimilation, are unlikely.

probabilistic model is available. Instead, the environment's impact on the
agents in the network is seen through a sequence of cost functions, revealed to
the agents in a causal manner only after all the relevant actions are taken.
There are two kinds of costs: individual costs incurred by each agent and
local-interaction costs incurred by each agent and its neighbors in the social
network. Moreover, agents have inertia: each agent has a default mixed strategy
that stays fixed regardless of the state of the environment, and must expend
effort to deviate from this strategy in order to respond to cost signals coming
from the environment. We construct a decentralized strategy, wherein each agent
selects its action based only on the costs directly affecting it and on the
decisions made by its neighbors in the network. In this setting, we quantify
social learning in terms of regret, which is given by the difference between
the realized network performance over a given time horizon and the best
performance that could have been achieved in hindsight by a fictitious
centralized entity with full knowledge of the environment's evolution. We show
that our strategy achieves the regret that scales polylogarithmically with the
time horizon and polynomially with the number of agents and the maximum number
of neighbors of any agent in the social network.

  Social Network Graph Publishing",,,,,"cs.CR cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Online social networks are being increasingly used for analyzing various
societal phenomena such as epidemiology, information dissemination, marketing
and sentiment flow. Popular analysis techniques such as clustering and
influential node analysis, require the computation of eigenvectors of the real
graph's adjacency matrix. Recent de-anonymization attacks on Netflix and AOL
datasets show that an open access to such graphs pose privacy threats. Among
the various privacy preserving models, Differential privacy provides the
strongest privacy guarantees.
  In this paper we propose a privacy preserving mechanism for publishing social
network graph data, which satisfies differential privacy guarantees by
utilizing a combination of theory of random matrix and that of differential
privacy. The key idea is to project each row of an adjacency matrix to a low
dimensional space using the random projection approach and then perturb the
projected matrix with random noise. We show that as compared to existing
approaches for differential private approximation of eigenvectors, our approach
is computationally efficient, preserves the utility and satisfies differential
privacy. We evaluate our approach on social network graphs of Facebook, Live
Journal and Pokec. The results show that even for high values of noise variance
sigma=1 the clustering quality given by normalized mutual information gain is
as low as 0.74. For influential node discovery, the propose approach is able to
correctly recover 80 of the most influential nodes. We also compare our results
with an approach presented in [43], which directly perturbs the eigenvector of
the original data by a Laplacian noise. The results show that this approach
requires a large random perturbation in order to preserve the differential
privacy, which leads to a poor estimation of eigenvectors for large social
networks.

should only be a few parts per thousand of the SM gauge coupling if BSM
dynamics respects decoupling. The same is true of the quartic-gauge-boson

confirmed for the standard lattice action, and for actions with distinct
couplings, in agreement with universality. Here we study a highly
unconventional formulation of this model, which belongs to the class of
topological lattice actions: it does not have any couplings at all, but just a
constraint for the relative angles between nearest neighbour spins. By means of
dynamical boundary conditions we measure the helicity modulus Upsilon, which
shows that this formulation performs a BKT phase transition as well. Its finite
size effects are amazingly mild, in contrast to other lattice actions. This
provides one of the most precise numerical confirmations ever of a BKT
transition in this model. On the other hand, up to the lattice sizes that we
explored, there are deviations from the spin wave approximation, for instance
for the Binder cumulant U_4 and for the leading finite size correction to
Upsilon. Finally we observe that the (un)binding mechanism follows the usual
pattern, although free vortices do not require any energy in this formulation.
Due to that observation, one should reconsider an aspect of the established
picture, which estimates the critical temperature based on this energy
requirement.

suppress relative-phase fluctuations, while attractive two-body coupling tends
to enhance them. Further applications of the formalism presented here and

multidimensional stochastic differential equations, with drift coefficient
depending only on the ordering of the coordinates of the process and diffusion
matrix proportional to the identity. These processes describe the evolution of
a system of Brownian particles moving on the real line with piecewise constant
drifts, and are the natural generalization of the rank-based diffusion
processes introduced in stochastic portfolio theory or in the probabilistic
interpretation of nonlinear evolution equations. Owing to the discontinuity of
the drift coefficient, the corresponding ordinary differential equations are
ill-posed. Therefore, the small noise limit of order-based diffusion processes
is not covered by the classical Freidlin-Wentzell theory. The description of
this limit is the purpose of this article. We first give a complete analysis of
the two-particle case. Despite its apparent simplicity, the small noise limit
of such a system already exhibits various behaviours. In particular, depending
on the drift coefficient, the particles can either stick into a cluster, the
velocity of which is determined by elementary computations, or drift away from
each other at constant velocity, in a random ordering. The persistence of
randomness in the zero noise limit is of the very same nature as in the
pioneering works by Veretennikov (Mat. Zametki, 1983) and Bafico and Baldi
(Stochastics, 1981) concerning the so-called Peano phenomenon. In the case of
rank-based processes, we use a simple convexity argument to prove that the
small noise limit is described by the sticky particle dynamics introduced by
Brenier and Grenier (SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 1998), where particles travel at
constant velocity between collisions, at which they stick together. In the
general case of order-based processes, we give a sufficient condition on the
drift for all the particles to aggregate into a single cluster, and compute the
velocity of this cluster. Our argument consists in turning the study of the
small noise limit into the study of the long time behaviour of a suitably
rescaled process, and then exhibiting a Lyapunov functional for this rescaled
process.

mixing sequence with purely star-forming galaxies. This mixing sequence may
change dramatically with cosmic time, due to the metallicity sensitivity of the
optical emission-lines. Furthermore, the position of the mixing sequence may
probe metallicity gradients in galaxies as a function of redshift, depending on

garnered a lot of interest because experiments with ultracold atomic gases in
optical lattices could be used as a simulator for phenomena of magnetic
systems. A paradigmatic example is the time evolution of a domain-wall state of
a spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain, the so-called domain-wall melting. The model can
be implemented by having two species of bosonic atoms with unity filling and
strong on-site repulsion U in an optical lattice. In this paper, we study the
domain-wall melting in such a setup on the basis of the time-dependent density
matrix renormalization group (tDMRG). We are particularly interested in the
effects of defects that originate from an imperfect preparation of the initial
state. Typical defects are holes (empty sites) and flipped spins. We show that
the dominating effects of holes on observables like the spatially resolved
magnetization can be taken account of by a linear combination of spatially
shifted observables from the clean case. For sufficiently large U, further
effects due to holes become negligible. In contrast, the effects of spin flips
are more severe as their dynamics occur on the same time scale as that of the
domain-wall melting itself. It is hence advisable to avoid preparation schemes
that are based on spin-flips.

sustain surface liquid water. Searching for terrestrial planets in the HZ of
nearby stars is the stated goal of ongoing and planned extrasolar planet
surveys. Previous estimates of the inner edge of the HZ were based on
one-dimensional radiative-convective models. The most serious limitation of
these models is the inability to predict cloud behavior. Here we use global
climate models with sophisticated cloud schemes to show that due to a
stabilizing cloud feedback, tidally locked planets can be habitable at twice
the stellar flux found by previous studies. This dramatically expands the HZ
and roughly doubles the frequency of habitable planets orbiting red dwarf
stars. At high stellar flux, strong convection produces thick water clouds near
the substellar location that greatly increase the planetary albedo and reduce
surface temperatures. Higher insolation produces stronger substellar convection
and therefore higher albedo, making this phenomenon a stabilizing climate
feedback. Substellar clouds also effectively block outgoing radiation from the
surface, reducing or even completely reversing the thermal emission contrast
between dayside and nightside. The presence of substellar water clouds and the
resulting clement surface conditions will therefore be detectable with the

a development along the line of research of discrete integrable Lagrangian
systems initiated in 2009 by Lobb and Nijhoff, however having its more remote
roots in the theory of pluriharmonic functions, in the Z-invariant models of
statistical mechanics and their quasiclassical limit, as well as in the theory
of variational symmetries going back to Noether. A d-dimensional
pluri-Lagrangian problem can be described as follows: given a d-form L on an
m-dimensional space (called multi-time, m>d), whose coefficients depend on a
sought-after function x of m independent variables (called field), find those
fields x which deliver critical points to the action functionals
$S_{\Sigma}=\int_{\Sigma} L$ for any d-dimensional manifold $\Sigma$ in the
multi-time. We derive the main building blocks of the multi-time Euler-Lagrange
equations for a discrete pluri-Lagrangian problem with d=2, the so called
corner equations, and discuss the notion of consistency of the system of corner
equations. We analyze the system of corner equations for a special class of
three-point 2-forms, corresponding to integrable quad-equations of the ABS
list. This allows us to close a conceptual gap of the work by Lobb and Nijhoff
by showing that the corresponding 2-forms are closed not only on solutions of

optical potential. Within the folding model, the isovector part of the OP is
determined exclusively by the neutron-proton difference in the nuclear

unique final form, regardless of moderately changing conditions, are of obvious
importance in biophysics. Protein folding is a case in point. We show that the
action principle can be applied directly to study the stability of biological
processes. The action principle in classical physics starts with the first
variation of the action and leads immediately to the equations of motion. The
second variation of the action leads in a natural way to powerful theorems that
provide quantitative treatment of stability and focusing and also explain how
some very complex processes can behave as though some seemingly important
forces drop out. We first apply these ideas to the non-equilibrium states
involved in two-state folding. We treat torsional waves and use the action
principle to talk about critical points in the dynamics. For some proteins the
theory resembles TST. We reach several quantitative and qualitative
conclusions. Besides giving an explanation of why TST often works in folding,
we find that the apparent smoothness of the energy funnel is a natural
consequence of the putative critical points in the dynamics. These ideas also
explain why biological proteins fold to unique states and random polymers do
not. The insensitivity to perturbations which follows from the presence of
critical points explains how folding to a unique shape occurs in the presence
of dilute denaturing agents in spite of the fact that those agents disrupt the
folded structure of the native state. This paper contributes to the theoretical
armamentarium by directing attention to the logical progression from first
physical principles to the stability theorems related to catastrophe theory as
applied to folding. This can potentially have the same success in biophysics as
it has enjoyed in optics.

with $\text{lk}(J,K)=0$. Suppose there is covering space $\pi_J: \Sigma \times
(0,1) \to \bar{S^3\backslash V(J)}$, where $V(J)$ is a regular neighborhood of
$J$ satisfying $V(J) \cap \text{im}(K)=\emptyset$ and $\Sigma$ is a connected
compact orientable 2-manifold. Let $K'$ be a knot in $\Sigma \times (0,1)$ such
that $\pi_J(K')=K$. Then $K'$ stabilizes to a virtual knot $\hat{K}$, called a
virtual cover of $K$ relative to $J$. We investigate what can be said about a
classical knot from its virtual covers in the case that $J$ is a fibered knot.
Several examples and applications to classical knots are presented. A basic
theory of virtual covers is established.

as a signed graph. The sign attached to an edge in this graph characterizes
whether the corresponding individuals or end nodes are friends (positive links)
or enemies (negative links). Pairs of nodes are randomly selected to interact
over time, and when two nodes interact, each of them updates its opinion based
on the opinion of the other node and the sign of the corresponding link. This
model generalizes DeGroot model to account for negative links: when two enemies
interact, their opinions go in opposite directions. We provide conditions for
convergence and divergence in expectation, in mean-square, and in almost sure
sense, and exhibit phase transition phenomena for these notions of convergence
depending on the parameters of the opinion update model and on the structure of
the underlying graph. We establish a {\it no-survivor} theorem, stating that
the difference in opinions of any two nodes diverges whenever opinions in the
network diverge as a whole. We also prove a {\it live-or-die} lemma, indicating
that almost surely, the opinions either converge to an agreement or diverge.
Finally, we extend our analysis to cases where opinions have hard lower and
upper limits. In these cases, we study when and how opinions may become
asymptotically clustered to the belief boundaries, and highlight the crucial
influence of (strong or weak) structural balance of the underlying network on
this clustering phenomenon.

considerable attention from both biologists and computer scientists. An
important component of current assembly methods is the scaffolding process.
This process involves building ordered and oriented linear collections of
contigs (continuous overlapping sequence reads) called scaffolds and relies on
the use of mate pair data. A mate pair is a set of two reads that are sequenced
from the ends of a single fragment of DNA, and therefore have opposite mutual
orientations. When two reads of a mate-pair are placed into two different
contigs, one can infer the mutual orientation of these contigs. While several
orientation algorithms exist as part of assembly programs, all encounter
challenges while solving the orientation problem due to errors from
mis-assemblies in contigs or errors in read placements. In this paper we
present an algorithm based on hierarchical clustering that independently solves
the orientation problem and is robust to errors. We show that our algorithm can
correctly solve the orientation problem for both faux (generated) assembly data
and real assembly data for {\em R. sphaeroides bacteria}. We demonstrate that
our algorithm is stable to both changes in the initial orientations as well as
noise in the data, making it advantageous compared to traditional approaches.

examined using epitaxial films. Each of the RE substitutions suppressed the
resistivity anomaly associated with the magnetic/structural phase transitions,
leading to the resistivity drops and superconductivity transitions. Bulk
superconductivity was observed at the maximum onset critical temperature
(Tconset) of 22.4 K for La-doping and 13.4 K for Ce-doping, while only broad
resistivity drops were observed at 6.2 K for Pr-doping and 5.8 K for Nd-doping
but neither zero resistivity nor distinct Meissner effect were observed at
least down to 2 K. The decrease in Tconset with increasing the number of RE 4f
electrons cannot be explained in terms of the crystalline qualities or
crystallographic structure parameters of the BaFe2As2 films. It was clarified,
based on resistivity-temperature analyses, that magnetic scattering became
increasingly significant in the above order of the RE dopants. The negative
magnetoresistance was enhanced by the Ce- and Pr-doping, implying that the
decrease in Tc originates from magnetic pair breaking by interaction of the
localized 4f orbitals in the RE dopants with the itinerant Fe 3d orbitals.

the hierarchy leads to a dependence on initial conditions and to the
coexistence of states which are not consistent with the theoretical

with a temperature of ~1 keV in excess of conceivable background and
contaminating emission (cosmic X-ray background, Galactic halo, intra-cluster

sources). Its surface brightness is consistent with having a spherical
distribution peaking at the center of the western lobe with a projected radius
of ~12 arcmin. If the volume filling factor of the thermal gas is assumed to be
unity, its estimated total mass amounts to ~10^{10} M_sun, which would be
~10^{2} times that of the central black hole and comparable to that of the

larger than those in the magnetic field and non-thermal electrons responsible

The Sturmian representation provides a numerical quadrature of the two-body
continuum which may be used to generate a complete set of states within any
desired three-body recombination pathway. Consequently, the dynamical
calculation may be conveniently formulated using the simplest energy transfer
mechanism, even for reactive systems which allow substantial rearrangement. The
Sturmian theory generalizes the quantum kinetic theory of Snider and Lowry [J.

pathway-independent part plus a non-equilibrium correction which depends on
tunneling lifetimes and pressure. Numerical results are presented for H$_2$
recombination due to collisions with H and He using quantum mechanical coupled
states and infinite order sudden approximations. These results may be used to
remove some of the uncertainties that have limited astrophysical simulations of

and computer science can be represented naturally as graph homomorphisms and as
weighted sums of graph homomorphisms. In this paper, we study the complexity of
counting homomorphisms modulo 2. The complexity of modular counting was
introduced by Papadimitriou and Zachos and it has been pioneered by Valiant who
famously introduced a problem for which counting modulo 7 is easy but counting
modulo 2 is intractable. Modular counting provides a rich setting in which to
study the structure of homomorphism problems. In this case, the structure of
the graph H has a big influence on the complexity of the problem. Thus, our
approach is graph-theoretic. We give a complete solution for the class of
cactus graphs, which are connected graphs in which every edge belongs to at
most one cycle. Cactus graphs arise in many applications such as the modelling
of wireless sensor networks and the comparison of genomes. We show that, for
some cactus graphs H, counting homomorphisms to H modulo 2 can be done in
polynomial time. For every other fixed cactus graph H, the problem is complete
for the complexity class parity-P which is a wide complexity class to which
every problem in the polynomial hierarchy can be reduced (using randomised
reductions). Determining which H lead to tractable problems can be done in
polynomial time. Our result builds upon the work of Faben and Jerrum, who gave
a dichotomy for the case in which H is a tree.

atom-atom entanglement can be accomplished in much the same way as with CW
lasers. By contrast, if the pulses are very strong ($\Omega \gg \otrap$),
impulsive spin-dependent kicks can be combined to create entangling gates which
are much faster than a trap period. These fast entangling gates should work
outside of the Lamb-Dicke regime and be insensitive to thermal atomic motion.

powerful engines and on the mechanisms through which energy is propagated from
the centre down the jet. The BL Lac object Mkn 421 is a TeV emitter, a bright
blazar at all wavelengths, and therefore an excellent target for variability
studies. Mkn 421 was observed by INTEGRAL and Fermi-LAT in an active state on
16-21 April 2013. Well sampled optical, soft, and hard X-ray light curves show
the presence of two flares. The average flux in the 20-100 keV range is 9.1e-11
erg/s/cm2 (~4.5 mCrab) and the nuclear average apparent magnitude, corrected
for Galactic extinction, is V ~12.2. In the time-resolved X-ray spectra (3.5-60
keV), which are described by broken power laws and, marginally better, by
log-parabolic laws, we see a hardening that correlates with flux increase, as
expected in refreshed energy injections in a population of electrons that later
cool via synchrotron radiation. The hardness ratios between the JEM-X fluxes in
two different bands and between the JEM-X and IBIS/ISGRI fluxes confirm this
trend. During the observation, the variability level increases monotonically
from the optical to the hard X-rays, while the large LAT errors do not allow a
significant assessment of the MeV-GeV variability. The cross-correlation
analysis during the onset of the most prominent flare suggests a monotonically
increasing delay of the lower frequency emission with respect to that at higher
frequency, with a maximum time-lag of about 70 minutes, that is however not
well constrained. The spectral energy distributions from the optical to the TeV
domain are satisfactorily described by homogeneous models of blazar emission
based on synchrotron radiation and synchrotron self-Compton scattering, except
in the state corresponding to the LAT softest spectrum and highest flux.

can be used to model evolved stars as well as protostars. We include
non-thermal emission from PAHs and very small grains, and external illumination

multiple dust species in each cell; based on this, a simple prescription is

calibration errors and to the synthesis method are investigated by means of a
suite of simulations based on 1638 CALIFA spectra for NGC 2916, with
perturbations amplitudes gauged in terms of the expected errors. A separate
study was conducted to assess uncertainties related to the choice of
evolutionary synthesis models. We compare results obtained with the Bruzual &
Charlot models, a preliminary update of them, and a combination of spectra
derived from the Granada and MILES models. About 100k CALIFA spectra are used
in this comparison.
  Noise and shape-related errors at the level expected for CALIFA propagate to
0.10-0.15 dex uncertainties in stellar masses, mean ages and metallicities.
Uncertainties in A_V increase from 0.06 mag in the case of random noise to 0.16
mag for shape errors. Higher order products such as SFHs are more uncertain,
but still relatively stable. Due to the large number statistics of datacubes,
spatial averaging reduces uncertainties while preserving information on the
history and structure of stellar populations. Radial profiles of global
properties, as well as SFHs averaged over different regions are much more
stable than for individual spaxels. Uncertainties related to the choice of base
models are larger than those associated with data and method. Differences in
mean age, mass and metallicity are ~ 0.15 to 0.25 dex, and 0.1 mag in A_V.
Spectral residuals are ~ 1% on average, but with systematic features of up to
4%. The origin of these features is discussed. (Abridged)

of the fact that Si II 6355 is free of HVFs at maximum light in all SNe Ia,

strength to the light-curve colour of the SNe Ia in our sample shows no
evidence of correlation. We find a correlation of HVF strength with the
velocity of Si II 6355 at maximum light (v_Si), such that SNe Ia with lower
v_Si have stronger HVFs, while those SNe Ia firmly in the ""high-velocity""

SNe Ia having weak HVFs. In general, we find that slowly declining (low
dm_15(B)) SNe Ia, which are more luminous and more energetic than average SNe
Ia, tend to produce either high photospheric ejecta velocities (i.e., high
v_Si) or strong HVFs at maximum light, but not both. Finally, we examine the
evolution of HVF strength for a sample of SNe Ia having extensive pre-maximum

theory for Euler weak solutions based on quantitative expressions of this

  We assume only that our velocity field is H\""{o}lder continuous in the

but precludes the application of Lagrangian methods or local well-posedness
theory. Despite the dramatic lack of well-posedness, we obtain a rich theory of
regularity in time for solutions, especially concerning advective derivatives.
In particular, any Euler flow of class $v \in L_t^\infty C_x^\alpha$ has
continuous advective derivatives of any order less than
$\frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha}$, and every point has a trajectory passing through it
that is $C^r$ for all $r < \frac{1}{1-\alpha}$, and one that is $C^\infty$ if

photometric data of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). To trace mass
distribution, the brightness distribution of member galaxies is smoothed by
using a Gaussian kernel with a weight of their optical luminosities. After
deriving the asymmetry, the ridge flatness and the normalized deviation of the
smoothed optical map, we define a relaxation parameter, Gamma, to quantify
dynamical state of clusters. This method is applied to a test sample of 98
clusters of 0.05<z\lesssim0.42 collected from literature with known dynamical
states and can recognize dynamical state for relaxed (Gamma\ge0) and unrelaxed
(Gamma<0) clusters with a success rate of 94%. We then calculate relaxation
parameters of 2092 rich clusters previously identified from the SDSS, of which
28% clusters are dynamically relaxed with Gamma\ge0. We find that the dominance

  In this model, random fitnesses in $[0,1]$ are associated to agents located
at the vertices of a graph $G$. Their fitnesses are ranked from worst (0) to
best (1). At every time-step the agent with the worst fitness and some others

new fitnesses are taken from an a priori fixed distribution, and the
\emph{endogenous case} where the new fitnesses are taken from the current
distribution as it evolves.
  We approximate the dynamics by making a simplifying independence assumption.
We use Order Statistics and Dynamical Systems to define a \emph{rank-driven
dynamical system} that approximates the evolution of the \emph{distribution} of
the fitnesses in these rank-driven models, as well as in the Bak-Sneppen model.

the energy distribution and are sensitive to possible deviations from the
standard equilibrium thermal-energy distribution, the well-known
Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution (\textsf{MBD}). In a previous paper published in
Physics Letters 441B(1998)291, Degl'Innocenti {\it et al}. made strong
constrains on such deviations with the detailed helioseismic information of the
solar structure. With a small deviation parameterized with a factor
exp$[{-\delta (E/kT)^2}]$, it was shown $\delta$ restricted between -0.005 and
+0.002. These constrains have been carefully reexamined in the present work. We
find that a normalization factor was missed in the previous modified
\textsf{MBD}. In this work, the normalization factor $c$ is calculated as a
function of $\delta$. It shows the factor $c$ is almost unity within the range
0$< \delta \leq$0.002, which supports the previous conclusion. However, it
demonstrates that $\delta$ cannot take a negative value from the normalization
point of view. As a result, a stronger constraint on $\delta$ is defined as
0$\leq \delta \leq$0.002. The astrophysical implication on the solar neutrino
fluxes is simply discussed based on a positive $\delta$ value of 0.003. The
reduction of the $^7$Be and $^8$B neutrino fluxes expected from the modified
\textsf{MBD} can possibly shed alternative light on the solar neutrino problem.
In addition, the resonant reaction rates for the $^{14}$N($p$,$\gamma$)$^{15}$O
reaction are calculated with a standard \textsf{MBD} and a modified
\textsf{MBD}, respectively. It shows that the rates are quite sensitive even to
a very small $\delta$. This work demonstrates the importance and necessity of
experimental verification or test of the well-known \textsf{MBD} at high
temperatures.

a novel characterization of the optimal throughput for the case of

of four improvement in throughput compared to slotted aloha. We apply our

strategy, where identity and data are transmitted optimally over the random

preparations, and demonstrate that the influence of state preparations depends
on the initial states prepared. Our results can be of interest to many topics
based on quantum open systems where system-environment correlation effects have
been neglected before.

differential equations. The statical structure of the network is described by a
directed and weighted graph whose nodes are certain subsets of neurons, and
whose edges are the groups of synaptical connections among those subsets.
First, we prove that among all the possible networks such that their respective
graphs are mutually isomorphic, there exists a dynamical optimum. This optimal
network exhibits the richest dynamics: namely, it is capable to show the most
diverse set of responses (i.e. orbits in the future) under external stimulus or
signals. Second, we prove that all the neurons of a dynamically optimal
neuronal network necessarily satisfy Dale's Principle, i.e. each neuron must be
either excitatory or inhibitory, but not mixed. So, Dale's Principle is a
mathematical necessary consequence of a theoretic optimization process of the
dynamics of the network. Finally, we prove that Dale's Principle is not
sufficient for the dynamical optimization of the network.

estimate the neutral gas mass over cosmic time, which is a possible indicator
of gas consumption as star formation proceeds. The DLAs and sub-DLAs are
believed to contain a large fraction of neutral gas mass in the Universe. In
Paper I of the series, we present the results of a search for DLAs and sub-DLAs
in the ESO-UVES Advanced Data Products dataset of 250 quasars. Here we use an
unbiased sub-sample of sub-DLAs from this dataset. We build a subset of 122
quasars ranging from 1.5 <z_em < 5.0, suitable for statistical analysis. The
statistical sample is analyzed in conjunction with other sub-DLA samples from
the literature. This makes up a combined sample of 89 sub-DLAs over a redshift
path of $\Delta z=193$. Redshift evolution of the number density and the line
density are derived for sub-DLAs and compared with the LLSs and DLAs
measurements from the literature. The results indicate that these three classes
of absorbers are evolving in the redshift interval 1 < z < 5. The column
density distribution, f(N,z), down to the sub-DLA limit is determined. The
flattening of f_(N,z) in the sub-DLA regime is present in the observations. The
redshift evolution of f_(N,z) down to sub-DLA regime is also presented,
indicating the presence of more sub-DLAs at high-redshift as compared to
low-redshift. f_(N,z) is further used to determine the neutral gas mass
density, Omega_g, at 1.5 < z < 5.0. The complete sample shows that sub-DLAs
contribute 8-20% to the total Omega_g from 1.5 < z < 5.0. In agreement with
previous studies, no evolution of Omega_g is seen from low-redshift to
high-redshift, suggesting that star formation solely cannot explain this
non-evolution and replenishment of gas and/or recombination of ionized gas is
needed. (Abridged)

blow up. It is shown that the same type of blow-up as for the perturbations of
the soliton can be observed which indicates that the theory by Martel, Merle

the soliton mass. We study the scaling of the blow-up time $t^{*}$ in

$t^{*}_{0}$ greater than the critical time of the corresponding Hopf solution
for $\epsilon\to0$. To study the cases with blow-up in detail, we apply the
first dynamic rescaling for generalized Korteweg-de Vries equations. This
allows to identify the type of the singularity.

intratumor heterogeneity at molecular, genetic and cellular levels which is
made responsible for emerging resistance to therapy. Therefore, researchers
search techniques to influence development of intratumor heterogeneity, which
requires understanding its role within the context of integrative, logically
consistent, framework, such as evolutionary theory. Although it is agreed that
intratumor heterogeneity increases probability of the emergence of therapy
resistant clones, more instructive role of its structure in the process of
cancer dynamics and metastasis is needed. In the paper, intratumor
heterogeneity is viewed as a product of two, in general stochastic, processes,
evolutionary optimization and changing environment, respectively. In
evolutionary theory, common risk-diversifying strategy displayed by isogenic
populations in unpredictably changing environments is bet-hedging. We suggest,
that the structure of intratumor heterogeneity is evolutionary trait evolving
to maximize the clonal fitness in changing (or uncertain) environment and that
its structure corresponds to bet-hedging strategy. We advocate our view by
reviewing and combining important cancer relevant concepts.

We find an upper limit m_a < 0.67 eV at 95% C.L. after marginalising over the
unknown neutrino masses, using CMB temperature and polarisation data from
Planck and WMAP respectively, the halo matter power spectrum extracted from
SDSS-DR7, and the local Hubble expansion rate H_0 released by the Carnegie
Hubble Program based on a recalibration of the Hubble Space Telescope Key
Project sample. Leaving out the local H_0 measurement relaxes the limit
somewhat to 0.86 eV, while Planck+WMAP alone constrain the axion mass to 1.01
eV, the first time an upper limit on m_a has been obtained from CMB data alone.
Our axion limit is therefore not very sensitive to the tension between the
Planck-inferred H_0 and the locally measured value. This is in contrast with
the upper limit on the neutrino mass sum, which we find here to range from 0.27
eV at 95% C.L. combining all of the aforementioned observations, to 0.84 eV
from CMB data alone.

thermoelectric power conversion. Using quantum dots embedded in semiconductor
nanowires, we measure thermovoltage and thermocurrent that are strongly
nonlinear in the applied thermal bias. We show that most of the observed

quantum-dot energy levels as a function of applied thermal bias and provide a
theoretical model of the nonlinear thermovoltage taking renormalization into

temperature and pressure: gas, liquid, and solid (crystal). These states are
separated by first-order phase transitions between them. In both gas and liquid
phases the complete translational and rotational symmetry exist, whereas in a
solid phase both symmetries are broken. In intermediate phases between liquid
and solid, which include liquid crystal and plastic crystal phases, only one of
the two symmetries is preserved. Among the fundamental states of matter, the
liquid state is most poorly understood. We argue that it is crucial for a
better understanding of liquid to recognize that a liquid generally has a
tendency to have local structural order and its presence is intrinsic and
universal to any liquid. Such structural ordering is a consequence of many body
correlations, more specifically, bond angle correlations, which we believe are
crucial for the description of the liquid state. We show that this physical
picture may naturally explain difficult unsolved problems associated with the
liquid state, such as anomalies of water-type liquids (water, Si, Ge, ...),
liquid-liquid transition, liquid-glass transition, crystallization and
quasicrystal formation, in a unified manner. In other words, we need a new
order parameter representing low local free-energy configuration, which is bond
orientational order parameter in many cases, in addition to density order
parameter for the physical description of these phenomena. Here we review our
two-order-parameter model of liquid and consider how transient local structural
ordering is linked to all of the above-mentioned phenomena. The relationship

applications including proving coding theorems, randomness extraction and the
study of conditions for reaching thermal equilibrium. However, our
understanding of the dynamics that lead to decoupling is limited. In fact, the
only families of transformations that are known to lead to decoupling are
(approximate) unitary two-designs, i.e., measures over the unitary group which
behave like the Haar measure as far as the first two moments are concerned.
Such families include for example random quantum circuits with O(n^2) gates,
where n is the number of qubits in the system under consideration. In fact, all
known constructions of decoupling circuits use \Omega(n^2) gates.
  Here, we prove that random quantum circuits with O(n log^2 n) gates satisfy
an essentially optimal decoupling theorem. In addition, these circuits can be
implemented in depth O(log^3 n). This proves that decoupling can happen in a
time that scales polylogarithmically in the number of particles in the system,
provided all the particles are allowed to interact. Our proof does not proceed
by showing that such circuits are approximate two-designs in the usual sense,

radiation, a weakly interacting component of radiation, is one of the important
ingredients in our cosmological model which is testable by Planck and other
observational probes. At the moment the possible existence of dark radiation is
an unsolved question. For instance, the discrepancy between the value of the
Hubble constant, H_0, inferred from the Planck data and local measurements of
H_0 can to some extent be alleviated by enlarging the minimal LambdaCDM model
to include additional relativistic degrees of freedom. From a fundamental
physics point of view dark radiation is no less interesting. Indeed, it could
well be one of the most accessible windows to physics beyond the standard
model. An example of this is that sterile neutrinos, hinted at in terrestrial
oscillation experiments, might also be a source of dark radiation, and
cosmological observations can therefore be used to test specific particle
physics models. Here we review the most recent cosmological results including a

curve in consideration, then $f$ can be represented as the sum of a derivation
and a linear function. When, instead of the additivity of $f$, it is assumed
that, in addition, the Cauchy difference of $f$ is bounded, a stability theorem
is obtained for such characterizations of derivations.

high PSNR value. Hence this new steganography algorithm is very efficient to

of extraneous noise sources, the most prominent of which is the coupling of
fluctuations along different spatial directions, which may affect any optical
tweezers setup. In this paper we analyze, both from the theoretical and the

Trap Optical Tweezers setups: the misalignment of traps and tether. We give
criteria to distinguish different kinds of misalignment, to estimate their
quantitative relevance and to include them in the data analysis. The
experimental data is obtained in a novel dual trap optical tweezers setup which
directly measures forces. In the case in which misalignment is negligible we
provide a method to measure the stiffness of traps and tether based on variance
analysis. This method can be seen as a calibration technique valid beyond the
linear trap region. Our analysis is then employed to measure the persistence
length of ds-DNA tethers of three different lengths spanning two orders of
magnitude. The effective persistence length of such tethers is shown to
decrease with the contour length, in accordance with previous studies.

stability of lamellar phases and the adhesion of membranes to surfaces. In
contrast to many theoretical studies, which predict a decrease of the pressure
with the cubed inverse distance between the membranes, Freund suggested very
recently a linear inverse distance dependence [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.
110, 2047 (2013)]. We address this discrepancy by performing Monte Carlo
simulations for a membrane model discretized on a square lattice and employ the
wall theorem to evaluate the pressure for a single membrane between parallel
walls. For distances that are small compared with the lattice constant, the
pressure indeed depends on the inverse distance as predicted by Freund. For
intermediate distances, the pressure depends on the cubed inverse distance as
predicted by Helfrich [Z. Naturforsch. A 33, 305 (1978)]. Here, the crossover
length between the two regimes is a molecular length scale. Finally, for
distances large compared with the mean squared fluctuations of the membrane,
the entire membrane acts as a soft particle and the pressure on the walls again
depends linearly on the inverse distance.

around ordered nano-sized domain structures as a result of the breakup of
tetrahedral connectivity in the disordered inter-domain network, aided by the
loss of bonded OH. These defects are removed as crystallisation progresses,
resulting in the decrease and eventual loss of photoluminescence. Thermally
processed hydrogenated amorphous silicate grains could therefore represent a

sufficient energy into a target system to be detectable with plausible

wavelengths of cosmological neutrinos can greatly enhance their cross sections

significant fraction of each neutrino's kinetic energy into the detector

of colloidal hard spheres via Brownian Dynamics simulations. We introduce two
external fields acting on the colloidal fluid: a uniform gravitational field
(body force), and a surface field imposed by pinning a layer of equilibrium
particles (rough wall). We show that crystal nucleation is suppressed in
proximity of the wall due to the slowing down of the dynamics, and that the
spatial range of this effect is governed by the static length scale of bond
orientational order. For distances from the wall larger than this length scale,
the nucleation rate is greatly enhanced by the process of sedimentation, since
it leads to a higher volume fraction, or a higher degree of supercooling, near
the bottom. The nucleation stage is similar to the homogeneous case, with
nuclei being on average spherical and having crystalline planes randomly
oriented in space. The growth stage is instead greatly affected by the symmetry
breaking introduced by the gravitation field, with a slowing down of the
attachment rate due to density gradients, which in turn cause nuclei to grow
faster laterally. Our findings suggest that the increase of crystal nucleation
in higher density regions might be the cause of the large discrepancy in the
crystal nucleation rate of hard spheres between experiments and simulations, on
noting that the gravitational effects in previous experiments are not
negligible.

ellipsoidal modulation. The optical light curve is dominated by variability
with an optical fractional rms of ~35 per cent, a factor of >3 larger than what
is observed in other systems at similar time-resolution. Optical flare events
lasting 2-10min with amplitudes of up to ~1.5 mag are seen as well as numerous
rapid ~0.8 mag dip events which are similar to the optical dips seen in
outburst. Similarly the infrared J-band light curve is dominated by variability
with a fractional rms of ~21 per cent and flare events lasting 10--30 min with
amplitudes of up to ~1.5 mag are observed. The quiescent optical to
mid-infrared spectral energy distribution in quiescence is dominated by a
non-thermal component with a power--law index of -1.4, (the broad-band rms SED
has a similar index) which arises from optically thin synchrotron emission most
likely originating in a weak jet; the lack of a peak in the spectral energy
distribution rules out advection-dominated models. Using the outburst
amplitude--period relation for X-ray transients we estimate the quiescent
magnitude of the secondary star to lie in the range V_min=22.7 to 25.6, which
when combined with the absolute magnitude of the expected M4.5 V secondary star
allows us to constrain to the distance to lie in the range 0.5 to 6.3 kpc.

This conclusion differs from the result based on Lorentz transformations. Since
rotational frames are not equivalent to inertial frames, we analyze the
rotational experiments by using the exact rotational space-time transformations
rather than the Lorentz transformations. We derive exact rotational
transformations on the basis of the principle of limiting Lorentz-Poincar\'e
invariance. The exact rotational transformations form a pseudo-group rather

radius and are consistent with two Davies-Jennison experiments. We also suggest
new experimental tests for the exact rotational transformations.

  simulations: SPH versus AMR","14 pages, 10 figures; submitted to MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stu418",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Abridged: We simulate a massive galaxy cluster in a LCDM Universe using three
different approaches to solving the equations of non-radiative hydrodynamics:
`classic' Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH); a novel SPH with a higher
order dissipation switch (SPHS); and adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). We find
that SPHS and AMR are in excellent agreement, with both forming a well-defined
entropy core that rapidly converges with increasing mass and force resolution.
By contrast, SPH exhibits rather different behaviour. At low redshift, entropy
decreases systematically with decreasing cluster-centric radius, converging on
ever lower central values with increasing resolution. At higher redshift, SPH
is in better agreement with SPHS and AMR but shows much poorer numerical
convergence. We trace these discrepancies to artificial surface tension in SPH
at phase boundaries. At early times, the passage of massive substructures close
to the cluster centre stirs and shocks gas to build an entropy core. At later
times, artificial surface tension causes low entropy gas to sink artificially
to the centre of the cluster.
  We use SPHS to study the contribution of numerical versus physical
dissipation on the entropy core, and argue that numerical dissipation is
required to ensure single-valued fluid quantities in converging flows. However,
provided this dissipation occurs only at the resolution limit, and provided
that it does not propagate errors to larger scales, its effect is benign. There
is no requirement to build `sub-grid' models of unresolved turbulence for
galaxy cluster simulations. We conclude that entropy cores in non-radiative
simulations of galaxy clusters are physical, resulting from entropy generation
in shocked gas during cluster assembly, putting to rest the long-standing
puzzle of cluster entropy cores in AMR simulations versus their apparent
absence in classic SPH simulations.

twodimensional model for the contraction patterns observed in protoplasmic
droplets of Physarum polycephalum. The model couples a model of an active
poroelastic two-phase medium with equations describing the spatiotemporal
dynamics of the intracellular free calcium concentration. The poroelastic
medium is assumed to consist of an active viscoelastic solid representing the
cytoskeleton and a viscous fluid describing the cytosol. The model equations
for the poroelastic medium are obtained from continuum force-balance equations
that include the relevant mechanical fields and an incompressibility relation
for the two-phase medium. The reaction-diffusion equations for the calcium
dynamics in the protoplasm of Physarum are extended by advective transport due
to the flow of the cytosol generated by mechanical stresses. Moreover, we
assume that the active tension in the solid cytoskeleton is regulated by the
calcium concentration in the fluid phase at the same location, which introduces
a chemomechanical feedback. A linear stability analysis of the homogeneous
state without deformation and cytosolic flows exhibits an oscillatory Turing
instability for a large enough mechanochemical coupling strength. Numerical
simulations of the model equations reproduce a large variety of wave patterns,
including traveling and standing waves, turbulent patterns, rotating spirals

rapidly growing and evolving mobile threat as attackers experiment with new

large-scale mobile botnets, the core network has also become vulnerable to
distributed denial-of-service attacks such as the signaling attack.
Furthermore, complementary access methods such as Wi-Fi and femtocells
introduce additional vulnerabilities for the mobile users as well as the core
network. In this paper, we present the NEMESYS approach to smart mobile network
security. The goal of the NEMESYS project is to develop novel security
technologies for seamless service provisioning in the smart mobile ecosystem,
and to improve mobile network security through a better understanding of the
threat landscape. To this purpose, NEMESYS will collect and analyze information
about the nature of cyber-attacks targeting smart mobile devices and the core
network so that appropriate counter-measures can be taken. We are developing a
data collection infrastructure that incorporates virtualized mobile honeypots
and honeyclients in order to gather, detect and provide early warning of mobile
attacks and understand the modus operandi of cyber-criminals that target mobile
devices. By correlating the extracted information with known attack patterns
from wireline networks, we plan to reveal and identify the possible shift in
the way that cyber-criminals launch attacks against smart mobile devices.

Truncated POV (TPOV) measures are introduced that can be measurable if object
systems satisfy the additional requirement of having separation status. The
separation status is generalised from domain of space to domain of phase space.
Starting from the previously introduced distinction between ancillas and

within a detector and the consequent loss of separation status is the objective

obtained in multi-field models. This is provided by non-linear angular friction
terms in the inflaton that provide a phase of non-slow-roll inflation before
the slow-roll inflation phase. This in turn provides a natural mechanism to
star small-field slow-roll at nearly zero velocity for arbitrary initial
conditions. We also show that there is a relation between the scale of SUSY
breaking sqrt (f) and the amount of non-gaussian fluctuations generated by the
inflaton. In particular, we show that in the local non-gaussian shape there
exists the relation sqrt (f) = 10^{13} GeV sqrt (f_NL). With current
observational limits from Planck, and adopting the minimum amount of
non-gaussian fluctuations allowed by single-field inflation, this provides a
very tight constraint for the SUSY breaking energy scale sqrt (f) = 3-7 x
10^{13} GeV at 95% confidence. Further limits, or detection, from next year's
Planck polarisation data will further tighten this constraint by a factor of
two. We highlight that the key to our approach is to identify the inflaton with
the scalar component of the goldstino superfield. This superfield is universal
and implements the dynamics of SUSY breaking as well as superconformal
breaking.

Comp. Phys. 2013] which permits the resolution of radiation forces on small
particles with arbitrary acoustic contrast factor. The IC method is based on a
Eulerian-Lagrangian approach: particles move in continuum space while the fluid
equations are solved in a regular mesh (here we use the finite volume method).
Thermal fluctuations in the fluid stress, important below the micron scale, are
also taken into account following the Landau-Lifshitz fluid description. Each
particle is described by a minimal cost resolution which consists on a single
small kernel (bell-shaped function) concomitant to the particle. The main role
of the particle kernel is to interpolate fluid properties and spread particle
forces. Here, we extend the kernel functionality to allow for an arbitrary
particle compressibility. The particle-fluid force is obtained from an imposed
no-slip constraint which enforces similar particle and kernel fluid velocities.
This coupling is instantaneous and permits to capture the fast, non-linear
effects underlying the radiation forces on particles. Acoustic forces arise
either because an excess in particle compressibility (monopolar term) or in
mass (dipolar contribution) over the fluid values. Comparison with theoretical
expressions show that the present generalization of the IC method correctly
reproduces both contributions. Due to its low computational cost, the present
method allows for simulations with many particles using a standard Graphical
Processor Unit (GPU).

by straightforward application of \epsilon-net argument and L\'evy's lemma. The
additivity conjecture was disproved initially by Hastings. Later, a proof via
asymptotic geometric analysis was presented by Aubrun, Szarek and Werner, which
uses Dudley's bound on Gaussian process (or Dvoretzky's theorem with
Schechtman's improvement). In this paper, we develop another proof along
Dvoretzky's theorem in Milman's view showing additivity violation in broader
regimes than the existing proofs. Importantly, Dvoretzky's theorem works well
with norms to give strong statements but these techniques can be extended to
functions which have norm-like structures - positive homogeneity and triangle
inequality. Then, a connection between Hastings' method and ours is also
discussed. Besides, we make some comments on relations between regularized
minimum output entropy and classical capacity of quantum channels.

work has emphasized the difficulty of forming these planets at their observed
locations. It has been suggested that these planets formed further out in their
discs and migrated in to locations where they are observed. We examine the
orbital evolution of planets embedded in circumbinary disc models for the three
systems Kepler-16, Kepler-34 and Kepler-35. The aims are: to explore the
plausibility of a formation scenario in which cores form at large distances
from the binaries and undergo inward migration and gas accretion as the gas
disc disperses; to determine which sets of disc parameters lead to planets
whose final orbits provide reasonable fits to the observed systems. We
performed simulations of a close binary system interacting with circumbinary
discs with differing aspect ratios, and viscous stress parameters. Once the
binary+disc system reaches quasi-equilibrium we embed a planet in the disc and
examine its evolution under the action of binary and disc forces. We consider
fully-formed planets with masses equal to those inferred from Kepler data, and
low-mass cores that migrate and accrete gas while the gas disc is being
dispersed. A typical outcome for all systems is stalling of inward migration as
the planet enters the inner cavity formed by the binary system. The
circumbinary disc becomes eccentric and the disc eccentricity forces the planet
into a noncircular orbit. For each of the Kepler-16b, Kepler-34b and Kepler-35b
systems we obtain planets whose parameters agree reasonably well with the
observational data. The simulations presented here provide support for a
formation scenario in which a core forms, migrates inward and accretes gas, but
accurate fitting of the observed Kepler systems is likely to require disc
models that are significantly more sophisticated in terms of their input
physics.

show that the ground state spaces of models within the same G-symmetric phase
carry equivalent representations of the group for each finite or infinite
sublattice on which they can be defined and on which they remain gapped. This
includes infinite systems with boundaries or with non-trivial topologies.
Second, for two classes of one-dimensional models, by two different methods,
for G=SU(2) in one, and G\subset SU(d), in the other we construct explicitly an
`excess spin' operator that implements rotations of half of the infinite chain
on the GNS Hilbert space of the ground state of the full chain. Since this
operator is constructed as the limit of a sequence of observables, the
representation itself is, in principle, experimentally observable. We claim
that the corresponding unitary representation of G is closely related to the
representation found at the boundary of half-infinite chains. We conclude with
determining the precise relation between the two representations for the class
of frustration-free models with matrix product ground states.

models by a factor of two. A spectrum of this star obtained with the Far
Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) shows broad absorption troughs with
sharp edges at 995 and 1010 A and a deep absorption feature at 1072 A, none of

resonances in the photoionization cross sections of the first and second
excited states of atomic nitrogen (2s$^2$ 2p$^3$ $^2$D$^0$ and $^2$P$^0$).

resonance-averaged cross sections usually employed to model stellar
atmospheres. These resonances are strongest in stellar atmospheres with
enhanced nitrogen and depleted carbon abundances, a pattern typical of post-AGB

very well the observed expansion history without a $\Lambda$, they fail to
produce the observed late-time suppression in the growth unless $\Lambda$ is
added to the dynamics. A simultaneous fit to the supernova and growth factor

99.65% while the Szekeres model without $\Lambda$ achieves only a 60.46% level.
When the data sets are considered separately, the Szekeres with no $\Lambda$
fits the supernova data as well as the $\Lambda$CDM does, but provides a very
poor fit to the growth data with only 31.31% consistency level compared to

single, imperfect, zero-width mirror. It is assumed that the microscopic
degrees of freedom on the mirror are confined to it, like in plasma or graphene
sheets. Therefore, the mirror is described by a vacuum polarization tensor
$\Pi_{\alpha\beta}$ concentrated on a time-dependent surface. Under certain
assumptions about the microscopic model for the mirror, we obtain a rather
general expression for the Euclidean effective action, a functional of the
time-dependent mirror's position, in terms of two invariants that characterize
the tensor $\Pi_{\alpha\beta}$. The final result can be written in terms of the
TE and TM reflection coefficients of the mirror, with qualitatively different
contributions coming from them. We apply that general expression to derive the
imaginary part of the `in-out' effective action, which measures dissipative
effects induced by the mirror's motion, in different models, in particular for
an accelerated graphene sheet.

For high level players, correlations are stronger at long time scales; whereas
in intermediate and low level players they reach the maximum value at shorter

The K pi system with total momenta P = 2*pi/L e_z, 2*pi/L (e_x + e_y) and 0,

recombination can bring together beneficial alleles from different backgrounds,

for well-mixed populations that when this interference is strong, the genome
can be seen as consisting of many effectively asexual stretches linked
together. The rate at which beneficial alleles fix is thus roughly proportional
to the rate of recombination, and depends only logarithmically on the mutation
supply and the strength of selection. Our scaling arguments also allow to
predict, with reasonable accuracy, the distribution of effects of fixed

of the mass of heavy mesons to estimate the modification of the charged B meson
mass, m_B, in the presence of an external Abelian magnetic field, eB. Two
simplifying limits were considered: the weak field limit in which the external
field satisfies eB << m^2 (with m being any of the masses involved) and the
strong field limit in which the field strength is small in comparison to the
bottom quark mass (or the B meson mass) squared but it is large compared to the
mass of the light quarks, i.e., m^2_{u,d} << eB << m^2_{b,B}. We found that m_B
decreases with the magnetic field in the both of these limits.

system under photodissociating feedback. We start from cosmological initial
conditions at z = 100, self-consistently following the formation of a minihalo
at z = 15 and the subsequent collapse of its central gas to high densities. The
simulations resolve scales as small as ~ 1 AU, corresponding to gas densities
of 10^16 cm^-3. Using sink particles to represent the growing protostars, we
evolve the stellar system for the next 5000 years. We find that this emerging
stellar group accretes at an unusually low rate compared with minihalos which
form at earlier times (z = 20 - 30), or with lower baryonic angular momentum.
The stars in this unusual system will likely reach masses ranging from < 1
M_sun to 5 M_sun by the end of their main-sequence lifetimes, placing them in
the mass range for which stars will undergo an asymptotic giant branch (AGB)
phase. Based upon the simulation, we predict the rare existence of Population
III stars that have survived to the present day and have been enriched by mass
overflow from a previous AGB companion.

origin of the HD45364 exoplanetary system, currently known to host two planets
close to the 3/2 mean-motion commensurability (MMR). We show that, due to high
surface density of the protoplanetary disk needed for Type III migration, this
model could only lead to planets in a quasi-resonant regime of motion, and thus
not consistent with the resonant configuration obtained by Correia et al.
(2009). Although both resonant and quasi-resonant solutions are statistically
indistinguishable with respect to radial velocity measurements, their distinct
dynamical behaviour is intriguing. We use the semi-analytical model to confirm
the quantitative difference between two configurations. In order to form a
system evolving inside the 3/2 resonance, we develop a different model. Our
scenario includes an interaction between different (but slower) planetary
migration types, planet growth, and gap formation in the protoplanetary disk.
The choice of the described evolutionary path was due to a detailed analysis of
the structure of the phase space in the vicinity of the 3/2 MMR employing
dynamical mapping techniques. The outcomes of our simulations are able to
reproduce very closely the 3/2 resonant dynamics obtained from the best-fit
presented by Correia et al. (2009). In addition, varying the strength of the
eccentricity damping, we can also simulate the quasi-resonant configuration
similar to that in Rein et al. (2010). We furthermore show that our scenario is
robust with respect to the physical parameters involved in the resonance
trapping process. However, the confirmation of our scenario will be possible
only with additional radial velocities measurements.

orbits. This local symmetry dynamics allows for a classification of inherently
different aperiodic lattices according to fundamental symmetry principles.
Illustrating the local symmetry distributional and dynamical properties for
several representative binary lattices, we further show that the renormalized
axis spacing sequences follow precisely the particular type of underlying
aperiodic order. Our analysis thus reveals that the long-range order of
aperiodic lattices is characterized in a compellingly simple way by its local
symmetry dynamics.

relations of each degree satisfy some bounds, there exist infinitely
dimensional algebras satisfying the relations. These algebras are called
Golod-Shafarevich algebras. This paper provides bounds for the growth function
on images of Golod-Shafarevich algebras based upon the number of defining
relations. This extends results from [32], [33]. Lower bounds of growth for
constructed algebras are also obtained, permitting the construction of algebras
with various growth functions of various entropies. In particular, the paper
answers a question by Drensky [7] by constructing algebras with subexponential
growth satisfying given relations, under mild assumption on the number of
generating relations of each degree. Examples of nil algebras with neither
polynomial nor exponential growth over uncountable fields are also constructed,
answering a question by Zelmanov [40].
  Recently, several open questions concerning the commutativity of algebras
satisfying a prescribed number of defining relations have arisen from the study
of noncommutative singularities. Additionally, this paper solves one such
question, posed by Donovan and Wemyss in [8].

temperatures, forming ordered structures. The competition between disorder,
which stabilizes the liquid phase, and energy, which favors the ordered
crystalline structure, inevitably turns in favor of the latter when temperature
is lowered and the entropic contribution to the free energy becomes
progressively less and less relevant. The ""liquid"" state survives at low
temperatures only as a glass, an out-of-equilibrium arrested state of matter.
This textbook description holds inevitably for atomic and molecular systems,
where the interaction between particles is set by quantum mechanical laws. The
question remains whether the same physics hold for colloidal particles, where
inter-particle interactions are usually short-ranged and tunable. Here we show
that for patchy colloids with limited valence, conditions can be found for
which the disordered liquid phase is stable all the way down to the
zero-temperature limit. Our results offer interesting cues for understanding
the stability of gels and the glass forming ability of atomic and molecular

of absorbing RW in the $N$-dimensional Weyl chamber. We consider Fujita's
polynomial martingales of RW with time-dependent coefficients and express them
by introducing a complex Markov process. It is a complexification of RW, in
which independent increments of its imaginary part are in the hyperbolic secant
distribution, and it gives a discrete-time conformal martingale. The

all polynomial martingales. From this determinantal-martingale representation

kernel as a function of initial configuration. We show that noncolliding RWs

measured down to 50 mK. It is found that the residual linear term $\kappa_0/T$
is negligible in zero magnetic field. The $\kappa_0/T$ shows a slow field
dependence at low magnetic field. These results suggest that the
superconducting gap is nodeless, unless there exist point nodes with directions
perpendicular to the heat current. Due to its high-symmetry fcc crystal
structure of Sn$_{0.6}$In$_{0.4}$Te, however, such point nodes can be excluded.

conventional umbrella sampling methods to generate sufficient sampling within
limited simulation time. Here we propose an efficient approach to combine
umbrella sampling with the integrated tempering sampling method. The umbrella
sampling method is applied to conformational degrees of freedom which possess
significant barriers and are chemically more relevant. The integrated tempering
sampling method is employed to facilitate the sampling of other degrees of
freedom in which statistically non-negligible barriers may exist. The combined
method is applied to two model systems and show significantly improved sampling
efficiencies as compared to standalone conventional umbrella sampling or

become a very efficient method in the simulation of biomolecular processes

evaluation of many candidate solutions. Nevertheless, solutions obtained in
simulation often do not work well on the real device. The transferability
approach aims at crossing this gap between simulation and reality by
\emph{making the optimization algorithm aware of the limits of the simulation}.
  In the present paper, we first describe the transferability function, that
maps solution descriptors to a score representing how well a simulator matches
the reality. We then show that this function can be learned using a regression
algorithm and a few experiments with the real devices. Our results are
supported by an extensive study of the reality gap for a simple quadruped robot
whose control parameters are optimized. In particular, we mapped the whole
search space in reality and in simulation to understand the differences between
the fitness landscapes.

to provide answers to an open question on minimal immersions, we introduced in

formulation of the WCW model, the flatness of the space-time is removed by
imposing the Weitzenb\""{o}ck condition in the Weyl-Cartan geometry, where the
dynamical variables are the space-time metric, the Weyl vector and the torsion
tensor, respectively. However, once the Weitzenb\""{o}ck condition is imposed on

dynamics and evolution is completely determined by the torsion tensor. We show
how to resolve this difficulty, and generalize the WCW model, by imposing the

Lagrange multiplier. The gravitational field equations are obtained from the
variational principle, and they explicitly depend on the Lagrange multiplier.

environment. In addition to its data queues, the SU has an energy queue to
store the harvested energy packets. The secondary energy packets are used for
primary packets decoding and data packets transmission. More specifically, if
the secondary energy queue is empty, the secondary source can neither help the
primary source nor transmit a packet from the data queues. The energy queue is
modeled as a discrete time queue with Markov arrival and service processes. Due
to the interaction of the queues, we provide inner and outer bounds on the
stability region of the proposed system. We investigate the impact of the
energy arrival rate on the stability region. Numerical results show the
significant gain of cooperation.

particle has a variable mass m(x,t) depending both on position (x) and time
(t). Geometrically the mass function is identified with one of the metric
function in a 1+1-dimensional spacetime. As a reflection of the equivalence
principle geodesics equation gives the Newton's law of motion leaving the right
hand side to be supplemented by the external forces. The resulting equation
involves the speed of light so that our equation of motion addresses a wider
scope than the customary classical mechanics. In the limit of infinite light
speed which amounts to instantaneous interaction we recover the classical
results.

to understand the fundamental limitations to hadronic energy resolution, and
other aspects of energy measurement, in high energy calorimeters. We have found
that dual-readout calorimetry provides heretofore unprecedented information
event-by-event for energy resolution, linearity of response, ease and
robustness of calibration, fidelity of data, and particle identification,
including energy lost to binding energy in nuclear break-up. We believe that
hadronic energy resolutions of {\sigma}/E $\approx$ 1 - 2% are within reach for
dual-readout calorimeters, enabling for the first time comparable measurement
preci- sions on electrons, photons, muons, and quarks (jets). We briefly
describe our current progress and near-term future plans. Complete information

commodities such as crude oil and natural gas. The model uses the concept of
market information about future supply and demand as a basis for valuation.
Physical ownership of a commodity is taken to provide a stream of convenience
dividends equivalent to a continuous cash flow. The market filtration is
assumed to be generated jointly by (i) current and past levels of the dividend
rate, and (ii) partial information concerning the future of the dividend flow.
The price of a commodity is the expectation under a suitable pricing measure of
the totality of the discounted risk-adjusted future convenience dividend,
conditional on the information provided by the market filtration. In the
situation where the dividend rate is modelled by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,
the prices of options on commodities can be derived in closed form. The
approach that we present can be applied to other assets that yield potentially
negative effective cash flows, such as real estate, factories, refineries,
mines, and power generating plants.

number-theoretical objects that arise in many areas of mathematics, including
lattice point enumeration, signature defects of manifolds and pseudo random
number generators. A remarkable feature of Fourier-Dedekind sums is that they
satisfy a reciprocity law called Rademacher reciprocity. In this paper, we
study several aspects of Fourier-Dedekind sums: properties of general
Fourier-Dedekind sums, extensions of the reciprocity law, average behavior of
Fourier-Dedekind sums, and finally, extrema of 2-dimensional Fourier-Dedekind
sums.
  On properties of general Fourier-Dedekind sums we show that a general
Fourier-Dedekind sum is simultaneously a convolution of simpler
Fourier-Dedekind sums, and a linear combination of these with integer
coefficients. We show that Fourier-Dedekind sums can be extended naturally to a
group under convolution. We introduce ""Reduced Fourier-Dedekind sums"", which
encapsulate the complexity of a Fourier-Dedekind sum, describe these in terms
of generating functions, and give a geometric interpretation.
  Next, by finding interrelations among Fourier-Dedekind sums, we extend the
range on which Rademacher reciprocity Theorem holds.
  We go on to study the average behavior of Fourier-Dedekind sums, showing that
the average behavior of a Fourier-Dedekind sum is described concisely by a
lower-dimensional, simpler Fourier-Dedekind sum.
  Finally, we focus our study on 2-dimensional Fourier-Dedekind sums. We find
tight upper and lower bounds on these for a fixed $t$, estimates on the argmax
and argmin, and bounds on the sum of their ""reciprocals"".

the largest rate achieved by these schemes is strictly smaller than capacity
$C$ (which is the same with and without feedback). In the extreme case where
the number of receivers $K\to \infty$, the largest rate achieved by
linear-feedback schemes with a message point tends to 0.
  To contrast this negative result, we describe a scheme for
\emph{rate-limited} feedback that uses the feedback in an intermittent way,
i.e., the receivers send feedback signals only in few channel uses. This scheme
achieves all rates $R$ up to capacity $C$ with an $L$-th order exponential

with applications to color image manipulations. This new formulation includes a
relaxation of the mass conservation constraint and a regularization term. These
two features are crucial for image processing tasks, which necessitate to take
into account families of multimodal histograms, with large mass variation
across modes.
  The corresponding relaxed and regularized transportation problem is the
solution of a convex optimization problem. Depending on the regularization
used, this minimization can be solved using standard linear programming methods
or first order proximal splitting schemes.
  The resulting transportation plan can be used as a color transfer map, which
is robust to mass variation across images color palettes. Furthermore, the
regularization of the transport plan helps to remove colorization artifacts due
to noise amplification.
  We also extend this framework to the computation of barycenters of
distributions. The barycenter is the solution of an optimization problem, which
is separately convex with respect to the barycenter and the transportation
plans, but not jointly convex. A block coordinate descent scheme converges to a
stationary point of the energy. We show that the resulting algorithm can be
used for color normalization across several images. The relaxed and regularized
barycenter defines a common color palette for those images. Applying color
transfer toward this average palette performs a color normalization of the
input images.

systems in quasar spectra appear to be metal-rich, many with even super-solar
element abundances. This raises the question whether some sub-DLAs may harbor
active galactic nuclei (AGN) since supersolar metallicities are observed in
AGN. Here we investigate this question based on a mini-survey of 21 quasars
known to contain sub-DLAs in their spectra. The X-ray observations were
performed with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. In cases of no detection we
estimated upper limits of the X-ray luminosities of possible AGNs at the
redshifts of the sub-DLAs. In six cases we find possible X-ray emission within
~ 1 arcsec of the background quasar consistent with the presence of a nearby
X-ray source. If these nearby X-ray sources are at the redshifts of the
sub-DLAs, their estimated 0.2-10 keV luminosities range between 0.8 x
10^{44}h^{-2} and 4.2 x 10^{44}h^{-2} erg s^{-1}, thus ruling out a normal
late-type galaxy origin, and suggesting that the emission originates in a
galactic nucleus near the center of a protogalaxy. The projected distances of
these possible nearby X-ray sources from the background quasars lie in the
range of 3-7 h^{-1} kpc, consistent with our hypothesis that they represent
AGNs centered on the sub-DLAs. Deeper follow-up X-ray and optical observations

  With microarray technology becoming mature and popular, the selection and use
of a small number of relevant genes for accurate classification of samples is a
hot topic in the circles of biostatistics and bioinformatics. However, most of
the developed algorithms lack the ability to handle multiple classes, which
arguably a common application. Here, we propose an extension to an existing
regularization algorithm called Threshold Gradient Descent Regularization
(TGDR) to specifically tackle multi-class classification of microarray data.
When there are several microarray experiments addressing the same/similar
objectives, one option is to use meta-analysis version of TGDR (Meta-TGDR),
which considers the classification task as combination of classifiers with the
same structure/model while allowing the parameters to vary across studies.
However, the original Meta-TGDR extension did not offer a solution to the
prediction on independent samples. Here, we propose an explicit method to
estimate the overall coefficients of the biomarkers selected by Meta-TGDR. This
extension permits broader applicability and allows a comparison between the
predictive performance of Meta-TGDR and TGDR using an independent testing set.
  Results
  Using real-world applications, we demonstrated the proposed multi-TGDR
framework works well and the number of selected genes is less than the sum of
all individualized binary TGDRs. Additionally, Meta-TGDR and TGDR on the
batch-effect adjusted pooled data approximately provided same results. By
adding Bagging procedure in each application, the stability and good predictive
performance are warranted.
  Conclusions
  Compared with Meta-TGDR, TGDR is less computing time intensive, and requires
no samples of all classes in each study. On the adjusted data, it has
approximate same predictive performance with Meta-TGDR. Thus, it is highly
recommended.

particular we show that in 'most' of these surfaces C^2 is 'rigidly embedded'.
As an application we give a description of 'embedded isomorphism classes' of
planar curves with one place at infinity. We also compute the canonical divisor
of these surfaces; it turns out that their log discrepancy is related to the
Frobenius number of the semigroup of poles along the curve at infinity. We use
the computation to classify Gorenstein primitive compactifications of C^2 with
rational and minimally elliptic singularities, extending a result of Brenton,
Drucker and Prins (Ann. of Math. Stud., vol 100, 1981). As another application
we characterize weighted projective spaces of the form P^2(1,1,q) in terms of
their 'log discrepancy' and 'index', generalizing a characterization of P^2 due
to Borisov (Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics, 2014).

perform 3D hydrodynamical simulations of the interaction of the SN Ia ejecta
with the He companion taking into account its orbital motion and spin. It is
found that only 2%--5% of the initial companion mass are stripped off from the
outer layers of He companions due to the SN impact. The dependence of the
unbound mass (or the kick velocity) on the orbital separation can be fitted in
good approximation by a power law for a given companion model. After the SN
impact, the outer layers of a He donor star are significantly enriched with
heavy elements from the low-expansion-velocity tail of SN Ia ejecta. The total
mass of accumulated SN-ejecta material on the companion surface reaches about >
10e-3 M_sun for different companion models. This enrichment with heavy elements
provides a potential way to observationally identify the surviving companion
star in SN remnants. Finally, by artificially adjusting the explosion energy of
the W7 explosion model, we find that the total accumulation of SN ejecta on the
companion surface is also dependent on the explosion energy with a power law
relation in good approximation.

visible in long radio observations when they are consistently present over
time. Thereby, they might obstruct the detection of the weak astronomical
signals of interest. This issue is especially important for Epoch of
Reionisation (EoR) projects that try to detect the faint redshifted HI signals
from the time of the earliest structures in the Universe. We explore the RFI
situation at 30-163 MHz by studying brightness histograms of visibility data
observed with LOFAR, similar to radio-source-count analyses that are used in
cosmology. An empirical RFI distribution model is derived that allows the
simulation of RFI in radio observations. The brightness histograms show an RFI
distribution that follows a power-law distribution with an estimated exponent
around -1.5. With several assumptions, this can be explained with a uniform
distribution of terrestrial radio sources whose radiation follows existing
propagation models. Extrapolation of the power law implies that the current
LOFAR EoR observations should be severely RFI limited if the strength of RFI
sources remains strong after time integration. This is in contrast with actual
observations, which almost reach the thermal noise and are thought not to be
limited by RFI. Therefore, we conclude that it is unlikely that there are
undetected RFI sources that will become visible in long observations.
Consequently, there is no indication that RFI will prevent an EoR detection
with LOFAR.

period of superhumps in SU UMa-type dwarf novae during the growing stage (the
stage A superhumps). This method is based on a working hypothesis in which the
period of the superhumps at the growing stage is determined by the dynamical
precession rate at the 3:1 resonance radius, a picture suggested in our new
interpretation of the superhump period evolution during the superoutburst
(Osaki, Kato 2013, arXiv:1305.5877). By comparison with the objects with known
mass ratios, we show that our method can provide sufficiently accurate mass
ratios comparable to those obtained by quiescent eclipse observations. This
method is very advantageous in that it requires neither eclipses, nor an
experimental calibration. It is particularly suited for exploring the low
mass-ratio end of the evolution of cataclysmic variables, where the secondary
is undetectable by conventional methods. Our analysis suggests that previous
estimates of mass ratios using superhump periods during superoutburst were
systematically underestimated for low mass-ratio systems and we provided a new
calibration. It suggests that most of WZ Sge-type dwarf novae have secondaries
close to the border of the lower main-sequence and brown dwarfs, and most of
the objects have not yet reached the evolutionary stage of period bouncers. Our
result is not in contradiction with an assumption that the observed minimum
period (~77 min) of ordinary hydrogen-rich cataclysmic variables is indeed the
period minimum. We highlight the importance of early observation of stage A
superhumps and propose a future desirable strategy of observation.

the time-dependent ultrafast laser photo-electron emission from a flat metallic
surface to the space charge limited (SCL) current, including the effect of
non-equilibrium laser heating on metals at the ultrafast time scale. At a high
laser field, it is found that the space charge effect cannot be ignored and the
SCL current emission is reached at a lower value predicted by a short pulse SCL
current model that assumed a time-independent emission process. The threshold
of the laser field to reach the SCL regime is determined over a wide range of
operating parameters. The calculated results agree well with particle-in-cell
(PIC) simulation. It is found that the space charge effect is more important
for materials with lower work function like tungsten (4.4 eV) as compared to
gold (5.4 eV). However for a flat surface, both materials will reach the space
charge limited regime at the sufficiently high laser field such as $>$ 5 GV/m
with a laser pulse length of tens to one hundred femtoseconds.

bound the maximum effect of an exogenous parameter change on a system's

multimarket Cournot competition, where a positive price shock on a monopoly
market may actually reduce the monopolist's profit. We use our approach to
quantify for the first time the worst case profit reduction for multimarket
oligopolies exposed to arbitrary positive price shocks. For markets with affine
price functions and firms with convex cost technologies, we show that the
relative profit loss of any firm is at most 25% no matter how many firms
compete in the oligopoly. We further investigate the impact of positive price
shocks on total profit of all firms as well as on social welfare. We find tight
bounds also for these measures showing that total profit and social welfare
decreases by at most 25% and 16.6%, respectively. Finally, we show that in our

unique, thus, all our bounds apply to these game solutions as well.

topological quantum phase transition described by the three-dimensional quantum

huge span of scales, from cell colonies up to bird flocks and fish schools. The
most prominent trait of collective behaviour is the emergence of global order:
individuals synchronize their states, giving the stunning impression that the
group behaves as one. In many biological systems, though, it is unclear whether
global order is present. A paradigmatic case is that of insect swarms, whose
erratic movements seem to suggest that group formation is a mere epiphenomenon
of the independent interaction of each individual with an external landmark. In
these cases, whether or not the group behaves truly collectively is debated.
Here, we experimentally study swarms of midges in the field and measure how
much the change of direction of one midge affects that of other individuals. We
discover that, despite the lack of collective order, swarms display very strong
correlations, totally incompatible with models of noninteracting particles. We
find that correlation increases sharply with the swarm's density, indicating
that the interaction between midges is based on a metric perception mechanism.
By means of numerical simulations we demonstrate that such growing correlation
is typical of a system close to an ordering transition. Our findings suggest
that correlation, rather than order, is the true hallmark of collective
behaviour in biological systems.

compound LiCrO2. 10% Ga doping at the Cr site does not invoke any metastability
typical of a glassy magnetic state. However, similar amount of Mn doping
certainly drives the system to a spin glass state which is particularly evident
from the relaxation, magnetic memory and heat capacity studies. The onset of
glassy state in 10% Mn doped sample is of reentrant type developing out of
higher temperature antiferromagnetic state. The spin glass state in the
Mn-doped sample shows a true reentry with the complete disappearance of the
antiferromagnetic phase below the spin glass transition. Mn doping at the Cr
site can invoke random ferromagnetic Cr-Mn bonds in the otherwise 120 degree
antiferromagnetic triangular lattice leading to the non-ergodic spin frozen
state. The lack of spin glass state on Ga doping indicates the importance of
random ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic bonds for the glassy ground state in
LiCrO2. Spin glass state in GF system has been earlier observed even for small
non-magnetic disorder, and our result indicates that the issue is quite
nontrivial and depends strongly on the material system concerned.

consequence, any new frequencies are typically very close to the fundamental.

using relativistic oscillating mirrors, requires modulation frequencies in the
optical regime or even in the extreme ultraviolet. The latter has not been
proven possible to date. Here we demonstrate that individual strong harmonics

galaxy, at the resolution of 0.05 pc. The model includes star formation and a
new implementation of stellar feedback through photo-ionization, radiative
pressure and supernovae. The simulation resolves the structure of the
interstellar medium at subparsec resolution for a few cloud lifetimes, and at
0.05 pc for about a cloud crossing time. Turbulence cascade and gravitation
from the kpc scales are de facto included in smaller structures like molecular
clouds. We show that the formation of a bar influences the dynamics of the
central ~100 pc by creating resonances. At larger radii, the spiral arms host
the formation of regularly spaced clouds: beads on a string and spurs. These
instabilities pump turbulent energy into the gas, generally in the supersonic
regime. Because of asymmetric drift, the supernovae explode outside of their
gaseous nursery, which diminishes the effect of feedback on the structure of
clouds. The evolution of clouds is thus mostly due to fragmentation and gas
consumption, regulated mainly by supersonic turbulence. The transition from
turbulence supported to self-gravitating gas is detected in the gas density
probability distribution function at ~2000 cm^-3. The power spectrum density
suggests that gravitation governs the hierarchical organisation of structures
from the galactic scale down to a few parsecs.

and states of the system be respected, while optimizing some performance
criterion. In the presence of model uncertainties or disturbances, for many
control applications it suffices to keep the state constraints at least for a
prescribed share of the time, as e.g. in building climate control or load
mitigation for wind turbines. For such systems, a new control method of
Scenario-Based Model Predictive Control (SCMPC) is presented in this paper. It
optimizes the control inputs over a finite horizon, subject to robust
constraint satisfaction under a finite number of random scenarios of the
uncertainty and/or disturbances. While previous approaches have shown to be
conservative (i.e. to stay far below the specified rate of constraint
violations), the new method is the first to account for the special structure
of the MPC problem in order to significantly reduce the number of scenarios. In
combination with a new framework for interpreting the probabilistic constraints
as average-in-time, rather than pointwise-in-time, the conservatism is
eliminated. The presented method retains the essential advantages of SCMPC,
namely the reduced computational complexity and the handling of arbitrary
probability distributions. It also allows for adopting sample-and-remove
strategies, in order to trade performance against computational complexity.

remotely on patients with the use of robotics. The investigation and testing of
remote surgery using a robotic arm is presented. The robotic arm is designed to
have four degrees of freedom that track the surgeon's x, y, z positions and the
rotation angle of the forearm {\theta}. The system comprises two main
subsystems viz. the detecting and actuating systems. The detection system uses
infrared light-emitting diodes, a retroreflective bracelet and two infrared
cameras which as a whole determine the coordinates of the surgeon's forearm.
The actuation system, or robotic arm, is based on a lead screw mechanism which
can obtain a maximum speed of 0.28 m/s with a 1.5 degree/step for the
end-effector. The infrared detection and encoder resolutions are below 0.6
mm/pixel and 0.4 mm respectively, which ensures the robotic arm can operate
precisely. The surgeon is able to monitor the patient with the use of a
graphical user interface on the display computer. The lead screw system is
modelled and compared to experimentation results. The system is controlled
using a simple proportional-integrator (PI) control scheme which is implemented
on a dSpace control unit. The control design results in a rise time of less
than 0.5 s, a steady-state error of less than 1 mm and settling time of less
than 1.4 s. The system accumulates, over an extended period of time, an error
of approximately 4 mm due to inertial effects of the robotic arm. The results
show promising system performance characteristics for a relatively inexpensive
solution to a relatively advanced application.

weighted estimates. We show that if an operator $T$ satisfies a bound like $$
\|T\|_{L^{p}(w)}\le c\, [w]^{\beta}_{A_p} \qquad w \in A_{p}, $$ then the
optimal lower bound for $\beta$ is closely related to the asymptotic behaviour
of the unweighted $L^p$ norm $\|T\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)}$ as $p$ goes to 1 and
$+\infty$, which is related to Yano's classical extrapolation theorem. By
combining these results with the known weighted inequalities, we derive the
sharpness of the exponents, without building any specific example, for a wide
class of operators including maximal-type, Calder\'on--Zygmund and fractional
operators. In particular, we obtain a lower bound for the best possible
exponent for Bochner-Riesz multipliers. We also present a new result concerning
a continuum family of maximal operators on the scale of logarithmic Orlicz

parties is analyzed. In this context, we show that the angles, which describe
these basis transformations can be optimized compared to the application of a
Hadamard operation, which is the standard basis transformation recurrently
found in literature. As a main result, we show that the adversary's information
can be reduced to an amount of approximately 0.20752 when using a single basis
transformation and to an amount of approximately 0.0548 when combining two
different basis transformations. This is less than half the information
compared to other protocols using a Hadamard operation and thus represents an
advantage regarding the security of entanglement swapping based protocols.

  Molecular clouds (MCs) in the vicinity of SNRs provide increased amount of

models describing equilibrium and nonequilibrium interfaces on a substrate of a
finite Bethe lattice. An unusual logarithmic scaling behavior is observed for
the nonequilibrium models describing the scaling structure of the infinite
dimensional limit of the models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) class. This
gives rise to the classification of different growing processes on the Bethe
lattice in terms of logarithmic scaling exponents which depend on both the
model and the coordination number of the underlying lattice. The equilibrium
growth model also exhibits a logarithmic temporal scaling but with an ordinary
power law scaling behavior with respect to the appropriately defined lattice
size. The results may imply that no finite upper critical dimension exists for
the KPZ equation.

temperature is confirmed to be 5.1 K. Anisotropic behaviour of magnetization
and resistivity is observed along the two principal crystallographic directions
viz., [100] and [001]. The isothermal magnetization measured in the
magnetically ordered state at 2 K exhibits a spin re-orientation at 13.5 T for
field applied along [100] direction, whereas the magnetization was linear along
the [001] direction attaining a value of 0.94 $\mu_{\rm B}$/Ce at 14 T. The
reduced value of the magnetization is attributed to the crystalline electric
field (CEF) effects. A sharp jump in the specific heat at the magnetic ordering
temperature is observed. After subtracting the phononic contribution, the jump
in the heat capacity amounts to 12.5 J/K mol which is the expected value for a
spin ${1}{2}$ system. From the CEF analysis of the magnetization data the
excited crystal field split energy levels were estimated to be at 120 K and 230
K respectively, which quantitatively explain the observed Schottky anomaly in
the heat capacity. A magnetic phase diagram has been constructed based on the
field dependence of magnetic susceptibility and the heat capacity data.

methods applicable to any system of differential equations that obeys a
Lagrangian formulation. In this thesis, variational integrators are developed
for several important models of plasma physics: guiding centre dynamics
(particle dynamics), the Vlasov-Poisson system (kinetic theory), and ideal
magnetohydrodynamics (plasma fluid theory). Special attention is given to
physical conservation laws like conservation of energy and momentum.
  Most systems in plasma physics do not possess a Lagrangian formulation to
which the variational integrator methodology is directly applicable. Therefore
the theory is extended towards nonvariational differential equations by linking
it to Ibragimov's theory of integrating factors and adjoint equations. It
allows us to find a Lagrangian for all ordinary and partial differential
equations and systems thereof. Consequently, the applicability of variational
integrators is extended to a much larger family of systems than envisaged in
the original theory. This approach allows for the application of Noether's
theorem to analyse the conservation properties of the system, both at the
continuous and the discrete level.
  In numerical examples, the conservation properties of the derived schemes are
analysed. In case of guiding centre dynamics, momentum in the toroidal
direction of a tokamak is preserved exactly. The particle energy exhibits an
error, but the absolute value of this error stays constant during the entire
simulation. Therefore numerical dissipation is absent. In case of the kinetic
theory, the total number of particles, total linear momentum and total energy
are preserved exactly, i.e., up to machine accuracy. In case of
magnetohydrodynamics, the total energy, cross helicity and the divergence of
the magnetic field are preserved up to machine precision.

mini-array will be able to study in great detail relatively bright sources (a

energy resolution of about 10-15%. Thanks to the stereo approach, it will be

detections of very high-energy showers with core located at a distance up to
500 m, to compare the mini-array performance with the Monte Carlo expectations
by means of deep observations of selected targets, and to perform the first CTA

galactic pulsar wind nebulae, supernovae remnants, micro-quasars, and the
Galactic Center can be observed in a previously unexplored energy range, in

dissipative quantum system---is competition between oscillator potential energy
and spin tunneling rate. We show that these opposing tendencies cause
environmental entanglement through superpositions of adiabatic and
antiadiabatic oscillator states, which then stabilizes the spin coherence
against strong dissipation. This insight motivates a fast-converging
variational coherent-state expansion for the many-body ground state of the
spin-boson model, which we substantiate via numerical quantum tomography.

Some of them exhibit large deviations with respect to the SM predictions. We
explain the observed pattern of deviations through a large New Physics

Once low-recoil observables are included the significance gets reduced to 3.9

commonly referred to as inhibition of return (IOR). The dynamic neural field

time-specific copies -- called ""mementos"" -- of an archived original resource.
In theory, as an archive acquires additional mementos over time, a TimeMap
should be monotonically increasing. However, there are reasons why the number
of mementos in a TimeMap would decrease, for example: archival redaction of
some or all of the mementos, archival restructuring, and transient errors on
the part of one or more archives. We study TimeMaps for 4,000 original
resources over a three month period, note their change patterns, and develop a
caching algorithm for TimeMaps suitable for a reverse proxy in front of a
Memento aggregator. We show that TimeMap cardinality is constant or
monotonically increasing for 80.2% of all TimeMap downloads observed in the
observation period. The goal of the caching algorithm is to exploit the ideally
monotonically increasing nature of TimeMaps and not cache responses with fewer
mementos than the already cached TimeMap. This new caching algorithm uses
conditional cache replacement and a Time To Live (TTL) value to ensure the user
has access to the most complete TimeMap available. Based on our empirical data,
a TTL of 15 days will minimize the number of mementos missed by users, and
minimize the load on archives contributing to TimeMaps.

manually segmented salient regions?, 2) the properties of the salient regions:
for example, do large, medium and small salient regions present different
difficulties for saliency models? and 3) the metrics used to assess saliency
models: what advantages would there be to mix them with PCA? Statistical
analysis is used here to answer each of these three questions.

generated by wave self-interactions in the gluon plasma has been derived. A
complete set of equations of motion for the YM ""condensate + waves"" system

the visual world in an eficient manner. In this paper, we show how
computational models of this mechanism can be exploited for the computer vision
application of scene recognition. First, we consider saliency weighting and
saliency pruning, and provide a comparison of the performance of different
attention models in these approaches in terms of classification accuracy.
Pruning can achieve a high degree of computational savings without
significantly sacrificing classification accuracy. In saliency weighting,
however, we found that classification performance does not improve. In
addition, we present a new method to incorporate salient and non-salient
regions for improved classification accuracy. We treat the salient and
non-salient regions separately and combine them using Multiple Kernel Learning.
We evaluate our approach using the UIUC sports dataset and find that with a
small training size, our method improves upon the classification accuracy of
the baseline bag of features approach.

generalize one of the most important signal processing tools - windowed Fourier

explore related properties such as the localization of translated and modulated

consistent with 90{\deg}, i.e. along the Galactic plane, and the significance

  The shapes of PNe are related to angular momentum of the original star or

vector. In old, low-mass stars, the angular momentum is largely in binary
orbital motion. Consequently, the alignment of bipolar nebulae that we have
found indicates that the orbital planes of the binary systems are oriented
perpendicular to the Galactic plane. We propose that strong magnetic fields
aligned along the Galactic plane acted during the original star formation
process to slow the contraction of the star forming cloud in the direction
perpendicular to the plane. This would have produced a propensity for wider
binaries with higher angular momentum with orbital axes parallel to the
Galactic plane. Our findings provide the first indication of a strong,
organized magnetic field along the Galactic plane that impacted on the angular

gravitationally with the observed world. This scenario has three sterile
neutrinos associated with each flavour of ordinary neutrinos. Very tiny mass
splitting between these neutrinos is assumed to arise from lepton number
violating dimension five operators suppressed by the Planck scale. We show that
if a mass splitting of 10^(-15) eV^2 is induced between the four mass
eigenstates of a given species, then its flux will be suppressed at IceCube
energies by a factor of 4 which could be the explanation of the IceCube
observation that the muon neutrino flux is lower than expected. Hierarchies in
mass splitting among different flavours may result in different amount of
suppression of each flavour and based on this, we predict a difference in the
flavour ratios of the observed neutrinos which is significantly different
compared to the standard prediction of nu_e:nu_mu:nu_tau=1:1:1 which could
serve as a test for this model.

properties of the standard uniform random planar graph P_{n}, by which we mean
a graph chosen uniformly at random from the set of all planar graphs with
vertex set {1,2,...,n}, are now known, and variations on this standard random
graph are also attracting interest.
  Prominent among the work on P_{n} have been asymptotic results for the
probability that P_{n} will be connected or contain given components/subgraphs.
Such progress has been achieved through a combination of counting arguments and
a generating function approach.
  More recently, attention has turned to P_{n,m}, the graph taken uniformly at
random from the set of all planar graphs on {1,2,...,n} with exactly m(n) edges
(this can be thought of as a uniform random planar graph with a constraint on
the average degree). The case when m(n) = qn for fixed q in (1,3) has been
investigated, and results obtained for the events that P_{n,qn} will be
connected and that P_{n,qn} will contain given subgraphs.
  In Part I of this thesis, we use elementary counting arguments to extend the
current knowledge of P_{n,m}. We investigate the probability that P_{n,m} will
contain given components, the probability that P_{n,m} will contain given
subgraphs, and the probability that P_{n,m} will be connected, all for general
m(n), and show that there is different behaviour depending on which `region'

slow $\mathrm{K}^+$-currents, which effectively inhibit neuronal responses. How
these adaptation currents change the relationship between in-vivo like
fluctuating synaptic input, spike rate output and the spike train statistics,
however, is not well understood. In this computational study we show that an
adaptation current which primarily depends on the subthreshold membrane voltage
changes the neuronal input-output relationship (I-O curve) subtractively,
thereby increasing the response threshold. A spike-dependent adaptation current
alters the I-O curve divisively, thus reducing the response gain. Both types of
adaptation currents naturally increase the mean inter-spike interval (ISI), but
they can affect ISI variability in opposite ways. A subthreshold current always
causes an increase of variability while a spike-triggered current decreases
high variability caused by fluctuation-dominated inputs and increases low
variability when the average input is large. The effects on I-O curves match
those caused by synaptic inhibition in networks with asynchronous irregular
activity, for which we find subtractive and divisive changes caused by external
and recurrent inhibition, respectively. Synaptic inhibition, however, always
increases the ISI variability. We analytically derive expressions for the I-O
curve and ISI variability, which demonstrate the robustness of our results.
Furthermore, we show how the biophysical parameters of slow
$\mathrm{K}^+$-conductances contribute to the two different types of adaptation
currents and find that $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated $\mathrm{K}^+$-currents are
effectively captured by a simple spike-dependent description, while
muscarine-sensitive or $\mathrm{Na}^+$-activated $\mathrm{K}^+$-currents show a
dominant subthreshold component.

cost-sensitive learning (CSL). The main difference between them is that a CFL
approach seeks optimal classification results without requiring any cost
information, even in the class imbalance problem. In fact, several CFL
approaches exist in the related studies, such as sampling and some
criteria-based pproaches. However, to our best knowledge, none of the existing
CFL and CSL approaches are able to process the abstaining classifications
properly when no information is given about errors and rejects. Based on
information theory, we propose a novel CFL which seeks to maximize normalized
mutual information of the targets and the decision outputs of classifiers.
Using the strategy, we can deal with binary/multi-class classifications
with/without abstaining. Significant features are observed from the new
strategy. While the degree of class imbalance is changing, the proposed
strategy is able to balance the errors and rejects accordingly and
automatically. Another advantage of the strategy is its ability of deriving
optimal rejection thresholds for abstaining classifications and the
""equivalent"" costs in binary classifications. The connection between rejection
thresholds and ROC curve is explored. Empirical investigation is made on
several benchmark data sets in comparison with other existing approaches. The
classification results demonstrate a promising perspective of the strategy in
machine learning.

correlations in electronic structure calculations. Here we implement an
ab-initio Gutzwiller+LDA calculation, and apply it to a classic problem, the
ferromagnetism of bulk bcc Fe, whose nature has attracted recent interest. In
the conventional Stoner-Wohlfarth model, the ferromagnetic ordering of iron
sets in so that the electrons can reduce their mutual Coulomb repulsion at the
extra cost of some increase of electron kinetic energy. Density functional
theory within the spin polarized local density approximation (LDA) has long
supported that picture, showing that ferromagnetic alignment causes band
narrowing and a corresponding wavefunction localization, whence a kinetic
energy increase. However, because of its inadequate treatment of strong
intra-site correlations for localized d orbitals, LDA cannot be relied upon,
particularly when it comes to separately describing fine potential and kinetic
energy imbalances. With ab-initio Gutzwiller+LDA, we indeed find that the
effect of correlations is to dramatically reverse the balance, the
ferromagnetic ordering of Fe in fact causing a decrease of kinetic energy, at
the cost of some increase of potential energy. The underlying physical
mechanism, foreshadowed long ago by Goodenough and others, and more recently
supported by LDA+DMFT calculations, is that correlations cause eg and t2g 3d
orbitals to behave very differently. Weakly dispersive eg states are
spin-polarized and almost localized, while, more than half filled, the t2g are
broad band, fully delocalized states. Owing to intra-atomic Hund's rule
exchange which aligns eg and t2g spins, the propagation of itinerant t2g holes
is only allowed when different atomic spins are ferromagnetically aligned. We
thus conclude that double exchange is at work already in the most popular
ferromagnetic metal.

link. For the non-interacting system we derive a general formula in terms of
the two-particle Green's functions. We show that, contrary to the conventional
tunneling contacts, the resulting cumulant generating function has a doubled
periodicity as a function of the counting field. We apply our general formula
to short tight-binding chains and show that the resulting CGF perfectly
reproduces the known evidence for the persistent current. Its second cumulant
turns out to be maximal at the switching points and vanishes identically at
zero temperature. Furthermore, we apply our formalism for a computation of the
charge transfer statistics of genuinely interacting systems. First we consider
a ring with an embedded Anderson impurity and employing a self-energy
approximation find an overall suppression of persistent current as well as of
its noise. Finally, we compute the charge transfer statistics of a double
quantum dot system in the deep Kondo limit using an exact analytical solution

  Review",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In video-surveillance, person re-identification is the task of recognising
whether an individual has already been observed over a network of cameras.
Typically, this is achieved by exploiting the clothing appearance, as classical
biometric traits like the face are impractical in real-world video surveillance
scenarios. Clothing appearance is represented by means of low-level
\textit{local} and/or \textit{global} features of the image, usually extracted
according to some part-based body model to treat different body parts (e.g.
torso and legs) independently. This paper provides a comprehensive review of
current approaches to build appearance descriptors for person
re-identification. The most relevant techniques are described in detail, and
categorised according to the body models and features used. The aim of this
work is to provide a structured body of knowledge and a starting point for
researchers willing to conduct novel investigations on this challenging topic.

based on stochastically forced, non-linear delay differential equations to
study solar cycle fluctuations, in which, time delays capture the physics of
magnetic flux transport between spatially segregated dynamo source regions in
the solar interior. Using this model we explicitly demonstrate that the
Babcock-Leighton poloidal field source based on dispersal of tilted bipolar
sunspot flux, alone, can not recover the sunspot cycle from a grand minimum. We
find that an additional poloidal field source effective on weak fields--the
mean-field alpha-effect driven by helical turbulence--is necessary for
self-consistent recovery of the sunspot cycle from grand minima episodes.

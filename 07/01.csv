Scattering is the low control mechanism of the gate, which, in other systems,

previous papers [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 84}, 035323 (2011); Phys. Rev. B {\bf 87},

perfect spin filter due to a spin interference effect. By appropriately tuning
the external electric and magnetic fields which determine the Aharonov-Casher
and Aharonov-Bohm phases, and with some relations between the various hopping
amplitudes and site energies, the interferometer blocks electrons with a
specific spin polarization, independent of their energy. The blocked
polarization and the polarization of the outgoing electrons is controlled
solely by the external electric and magnetic fields and do not depend on the
energy of the electrons. Furthermore, the spin filtering conditions become
simpler in the linear-response regime, in which the electrons have a fixed
energy. Unlike the diamond interferometer, spin filtering in the double-dot
interferometer does not require high symmetry between the hopping amplitudes
and site energies of the two branches of the interferometer and thus may be
more appealing from an experimental point of view.

approach for financial markets, which al- lows to rewrite super-hedging
problems in terms of optimal control problems in standard form. Based on this,
we shall then consider hedging and pricing prob- lems under utility or risk
minimization criteria. This approach will turn out to be powerful whenever
linear (or essentially linear) problems are considered, but not adapted to more
general settings with non-linear dynamics (e.g. large investor models, high
frequency trading with market impact features, mixed finance/insurance issues).
In the second part of this lecture, we will develop on a new approach for risk
control problems based on a stochastic target formulation. We will see how
flexible this approach is and how it allows to characterize very easily super-
hedging prices in term of suitable Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman type partial differ-
ential equations (PDEs). We will then see how quantile hedging and expected
loss pricing problems can be embeded into this framework, for a very large
class of financial models. We shall finally consider a simple example of
optimal book liquidation in which the control is a continuous non-decreasing
process, as an illustration of possible practical developments in optimal
trading under risk constraint.These lectures are organized in small chapters,
each of them being focused on a particular aspect.

Lipschitz function. The associated continuous time stationary Markov chain will
define the\emph{a priori}probability.
  Given a Lipschitz interaction V:\{1,...,d\}^{\bb N}\to \mathbb{R}, we are
interested in Gibbs (equilibrium) state for such $V$. This will be another
continuous time stationary Markov chain. In order to analyze this problem we
will use a continuous time Ruelle operator (transfer operator) naturally
associated to V. Among other things we will show that a continuous time
Perron-Frobenius Theorem is true in the case V is a Lipschitz function.
  We also introduce an entropy, which is negative, and we consider a
variational principle of pressure. Finally, we analyze large deviations
properties for the empirical measure in the continuous time setting using
results by Y. Kifer.

motion. Observations are assumed to possess a non-trivial likelihood given the
latent path. Due to the non-Markovianity and high-dimensionality of the latent
paths, estimating posterior expectations is a computationally challenging
undertaking. We present a reparameterization framework based on the Davies and
Harte method for sampling stationary Gaussian processes and use this framework
to construct a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that allows computationally
efficient Bayesian inference. The Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is based
on a version of hybrid Monte Carlo that delivers increased efficiency when
applied on the high-dimensional latent variables arising in this context. We
specify the methodology on a stochastic volatility model allowing for memory in
the volatility increments through a fractional specification. The methodology
is illustrated on simulated data and on the S&P500/VIX time series and is shown
to be effective. Contrary to a long range dependence attribute of such models
often assumed in the literature, with Hurst parameter larger than 1/2, the
posterior distribution favours values smaller than 1/2, pointing towards medium

causal structure of the ambient Lorentzian spacetime. Thus, upon quantization,
it is sensitive to the long expected smearing of the light cone by vacuum
fluctuations in quantum gravity. After perturbative linearization, its mean and
variance are computed in the Minkowski Fock vacuum of linearized gravity. The
na\""ive divergence of the variance is meaningfully regularized by a length
scale $\mu$, the physical detector resolution. This is the first time vacuum
fluctuations have been fully taken into account in a similar calculation.
Despite some drawbacks this calculation provides a useful template for the
study of a large class of similar observables in quantum gravity. Due to their
large volume, intermediate calculations were performed using computer algebra
software. The resulting variance scales like $(s \ell_p/\mu)^2$, where $\ell_p$
is the Planck length and $s$ is the distance scale separating the (""lab"" and

the lab and the probe, diverging for low velocities. This puzzling behavior may

analogous to the quantum beat in a $\Lambda$-type level structure, particularly
enhances the measurement precision for non-secular hyperfine terms. Precisions
less than 0.5 MHz in the estimation of all the components in the hyperfine

determined the principal axes of the hyperfine interaction in the system.
Beyond the 1$^{\mathrm{st}}$ shell, this method can be universally applied to
other $^{13}$C nuclear spins interacting with the NV center.

category, except that the constraint morphisms are no longer required to be

Lane's five axioms. Whilst recent applications justify the use of skew-monoidal
structure, they do not give an intrinsic justification for the form the
structure takes (the orientation of the constraints and the axioms that they
satisfy). This paper provides a perspective on skew-monoidal structure which,
amongst other things, makes it quite apparent why this particular choice is a
natural one. To do this, we use the Catalan simplicial set C. It turns out to
be quite easy to describe: it is the nerve of the monoidal poset (2, v, 0) and
has a Catalan number of simplices at each dimension (hence the name). Our
perspective is that C classifies skew-monoidal structures in the sense that
simplicial maps from C into a suitably-defined nerve of Cat are precisely
skew-monoidal categories. More generally, skew monoidales in a monoidal
bicategory K are classified by maps from C into the simplicial nerve of K.

charged black holes; hence, strong cosmic censorship seems not to be safe. We
observed the scalar field dynamics outside the horizon. There should remain a
non-trivial scalar field combination - 'charge cloud' - between the horizon and
the boundary. This can give some meaning in terms of the AdS/CFT

required to shear a fluid increases faster than linearly with shear rate. Many
concentrated suspensions of particles exhibit an especially dramatic version,
known as Discontinuous Shear Thickening (DST), in which the stress suddenly
jumps with increasing shear rate and produces solid-like behavior. The best
known example of such counter-intuitive response to applied stresses occurs in
mixtures of cornstarch in water. Over the last several years, this
shear-induced solid-like behavior together with a variety of other unusual
fluid phenomena has generated considerable interest in the physics of densely
packed suspensions. In this review, we discuss the common physical properties
of systems exhibiting shear thickening, and different mechanisms and models
proposed to describe it. We then suggest how these mechanisms may be related
and generalized, and propose a general phase diagram for shear thickening
systems. We also discuss how recent work has related the physics of shear
thickening to that of granular materials and jammed systems. Since DST is
described by models that require only simple generic interactions between
particles, we outline the broader context of other concentrated many-particle
systems such as foams and emulsions, and explain why DST is restricted to the
parameter regime of hard-particle suspensions. Finally, we discuss some of the
outstanding problems and emerging opportunities.

gravitational redshift measurements, two research teams have recently disagreed
on the physical cause of the shift. Regardless of any discussion on the
interferometer aspect\,---\,we find that both groups of authors miss the
important point that the ratio of gravitational to the electrostatic forces is
generally very small. For instance, the gravitational force acting on an
electron in a hydrogen atom situated in the Sun's photosphere to the
electrostatic force between the proton and the electron is approximately $3
\times 10^{-21}$. A comparison of this ratio with the predicted and observed
solar redshift indicates a discrepancy of many orders of magnitude. Here we
show, with Einstein's early assumption of the frequency of spectral lines
depending only on the generating ion itself as starting point, that a solution
can be formulated based on a two-step process in analogy with Fermi's treatment
of the Doppler effect. It provides a sequence of physical processes in line
with the conservation of energy and momentum resulting in the observed shift
and does not employ a geometric description. The gravitational field affects
the release of the photon and not the atomic transition. The control parameter
is the speed of light. The atomic emission is then contrasted with the
gravitational redshift of matter-antimatter annihilation events.

be huge in its size and its cost. In this paper a future intense-laser ion
accelerator is proposed to make the ion accelerator compact. An intense
femtosecond pulsed laser was employed to accelerate ions. The issues in the
laser ion accelerator include the energy efficiency from the laser to the ions,
the ion beam collimation, the ion energy spectrum control, the ion beam
bunching and the ion particle energy control. In the study particle computer
simulations were performed to solve the issues, and each component was designed
to control the ion beam quality. When an intense laser illuminates a target,
electrons in the target are accelerated and leave from the target; temporarily
a strong electric field is formed between the high-energy electrons and the
target ions, and the target ions are accelerated. The energy efficiency from
the laser to ions was improved by using a solid target with a fine
sub-wavelength structure or by a near-critical density gas plasma. The ion beam
collimation was realized by holes behind the solid target. The control of the
ion energy spectrum and the ion particle energy, and the ion beam bunching were
successfully realized by a multi-stage laser-target interaction. The present
study proposed a novel concept for a future compact laser ion accelerator,
based on each component study required to control the ion beam quality and
parameters.

made between current and earlier M13 star classification. Both O and Na
empirical differential abundance distributions are determined for each class

with their theoretical counterparts due to cosmic scatter obeying a Gaussian
distribution whose parameters are inferred from related subsamples. The
procedure is repeated with regard to four additional classes according if
oxygen and sodium abundance is above (stage CE) or below (stage AF) a selected
threshold. Both O and Na empirical differential abundance distributions,
related to the whole sample, exhibit a linear fit for AF and CE stage. Within
the errors, the oxygen slope for CE stage is equal and opposite in sign with
respect of the sodium slope for AF stage, while the contrary holds in dealing
with the oxygen slope for AF stage with respect to the sodium slope for CE
stage. In the light of simple models of chemical evolution applied to M13, the

time series and has been exploited in many fields. However, fitting high
dimensional VAR model poses some unique challenges: On one hand, the
dimensionality, caused by modeling a large number of time series and higher
order autoregressive processes, is usually much higher than the time series
length; On the other hand, the temporal dependence structure in the VAR model
gives rise to extra theoretical challenges. In high dimensions, one popular
approach is to assume the transition matrix is sparse and fit the VAR model
using the ""least squares"" method with a lasso-type penalty. In this manuscript,
we propose an alternative way in estimating the VAR model. The main idea is,
via exploiting the temporal dependence structure, to formulate the estimating
problem into a linear program. There is instant advantage for the proposed
approach over the lasso-type estimators: The estimation equation can be
decomposed into multiple sub-equations and accordingly can be efficiently
solved in a parallel fashion. In addition, our method brings new theoretical
insights into the VAR model analysis. So far the theoretical results developed
in high dimensions (e.g., Song and Bickel (2011) and Kock and Callot (2012))
mainly pose assumptions on the design matrix of the formulated regression
problems. Such conditions are indirect about the transition matrices and not
transparent. In contrast, our results show that the operator norm of the
transition matrices plays an important role in estimation accuracy. We provide
explicit rates of convergence for both estimation and prediction. In addition,
we provide thorough experiments on both synthetic and real-world equity data to
show that there are empirical advantages of our method over the lasso-type
estimators in both parameter estimation and forecasting.

prove that equilibrium configurations (not only minimizers) cannot be uniaxial

equilibrium configurations with at least one translational invariance direction
must have a uniform director field. In the case of a hybrid nematic cell, or of

behavior of two pulsars, B0823+26 and B1929+10, that demonstrates a rapid
change of pulsar rotation parameters such that the sign of the second
derivative $\ddot\nu$ is reversed. An analysis of the $\ddot\nu$ changes showed
that this process can be considered as a modulation process in $\ddot\nu$. We
showed that the process of rapidly changing of pulsar rotation parameters
represents a new type of rotational irregularity that, together with three
other types of rotational irregularities (discrete glitches, slow glitches and
quasi-periodic oscillations), forms a large-scale structure of timing noise.
These effects are all the cause of the deviation of the timing behavior of most
ordinary pulsars from a simple $\nu,\,\dot\nu$ spin-down model. We found that
all four types of observed rotational irregularities have evolving nature.
Irregularities in pulsar rotation rate pass through three evolutional stages
that show that a certain type of rotational irregularity can occur only at a
certain stage of pulsar rotation evolution. The age boundaries between
different evolutionary stages are indistinct and diffusive. This fact is
because different pulsars having similar properties evolve along different
paths. The evolutionary scenario of the occurrence of rotational irregularities
explains well many of the observed properties of pulsar rotation.

the maximum mass of neutron star increases as the quark mass decreases toward

mechanism that defines the branch points is still elusive. Here we obtained a
2D movie of kidney branching morphogenesis in culture to test different models
of branching morphogenesis with physiological growth dynamics. We carried out
image segmentation and calculated the displacement fields between the frames.
The models were subsequently solved on the 2D domain, that was extracted from
the movie. We find that Turing patterns are sensitive to the initial conditions
when solved on the epithelial shapes. A previously proposed diffusion-dependent
geometry effect allowed us to reproduce the growth fields reasonably well, both
for an inhibitor of branching that was produced in the epithelium, and for an
inducer of branching that was produced in the mesenchyme. The latter could be
represented by Glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), which is expressed in
the mesenchyme and induces outgrowth of ureteric branches. Considering that the
Turing model represents the interaction between the GDNF and its receptor RET
very well and that the model reproduces the relevant expression patterns in
developing wildtype and mutant kidneys, it is well possible that a combination
of the Turing mechanism and the geometry effect control branching
morphogenesis.

evaluating eigenvalues of a L-dimensional matrix, which enables us to calculate
easily the block entanglement for large-N chains numerically. The entanglement
entropy grows as log L, at the degeneracy point h=0, and only for J_x=J_y. For
nonzero magnetic field, the entropy becomes independent of the size, thus
obeying the area law. For unequal J_x and J_y, the block entropy shows a

of masses and radii of ther component stars. If at least one of the stars has
evolved off the main sequence (MS), the masses and radii give a strict
constraint on the age of the stars. Several dEBs containing a bright K giant
and a fainter MS star have been discovered by the Kepler satellite. The mass
and radius of a red giant (RG) star can also be derived from its asteroseismic
signal. The parameters determined in this way depend on stellar models and may
contain systematic errors. It is important to validate the asteroseismically
determined mass and radius with independent methods. This can be done when
stars are members of stellar clusters or members of dEBs. KIC 8410637 consists
of an RG and an MS star. The aim is to derive accurate masses and radii for
both components and provide the foundation for a strong test of the
asteroseismic method and the accuracy of the deduced mass, radius and age. We
analyse high-resolution spectra from three different spectrographs. We also
calculate a fit to the Kepler light curve and use ground-based photometry to
determine the flux ratios between the component stars in the BVRI passbands. We
measured the masses and radii of the stars in the dEB, and the classical
parameters Teff, log g and [Fe/H] from the spectra and ground-based photometry.
The RG component of KIC 8410637 is most likely in the core helium-burning red
clump phase of evolution and has an age and composition very similar to the
stars in the open cluster NGC 6819. The mass of the RG in KIC 8410637 should
therefore be similar to the mass of RGs in NGC 6819, thus lending support to
the most up-to-date version of the asteroseismic scaling relations. This is the
first direct measurement of both mass and radius for an RG to be compared with
values for RGs from asteroseismic scaling relations.

considered. Based on Monte Carlo (MC) data, we confirm the fact stated earlier
by Engels and Vogt, that the transverse two-plane correlation function of the
O(4) model for lattice sizes about L=120 and small external fields h is very
well described by a Gaussian approximation. However, we show that fits of not
lower quality are provided by certain non-Gaussian approximation. We have also
tested larger lattice sizes, up to L=512. The Fourier-transformed transverse
and longitudinal two-point correlation functions have Goldstone mode
singularities in the thermodynamic limit at k --> 0 and h=+0, i.e., G_perp(k) =
a k^{-lambda_perp} and G_parallel(k) = b k^{-lambda_parallel}, respectively.
Here a and b are the amplitudes, k is the magnitude of the wave vector. The
exponents lambda_perp, lambda_parallel and the ratio b M^2/a^2, where M is the
spontaneous magnetization, are universal according to the GFD (grouping of
Feynman diagrams) approach. Here we find that the universality follows also
from the standard (Gaussian) theory, yielding b M^2/a^2 = (n-1)/16. Our MC
estimates of this ratio are 0.06 +/- 0.01 for n=2, 0.17 +/- 0.01 for n=4 and
0.498 +/- 0.010 for n=10. According to these and our earlier MC results, the
asymptotic behavior and Goldstone mode singularities are not exactly described
by the standard theory. This is expected from the GFD theory. We have found
appropriate analytic approximations for G_perp(k) and G_parallel(k), well
fitting the simulation data for small k. We have used them to test the
Patashinski--Pokrovski relation and have found that it holds approximately.

probabilistic method of embedding a high dimensional dataset in terms low
dimensional `latent' variables. In this paper we illustrate that maximum a
posteriori (MAP) estimation of the latent variables and hyperparameters can be
used for model selection and hence we can determine the optimal number or
latent variables and the most appropriate model. This is an alternative to the
variational approaches developed recently and may be useful when we want to use
a non-Gaussian prior or kernel functions that don't have automatic relevance

estimate for the hyperparameter posterior. Secondly, we use the GP-LVM to
integrate multiple data sources by simultaneously embedding them in terms of
common latent variables. We present results from synthetic data to illustrate
the successful detection and retrieval of low dimensional structure from high
dimensional data. We demonstrate that the integration of multiple data sources
leads to more robust performance. Finally, we show that when the data are used
for binary classification tasks we can attain a significant gain in prediction

which partitions the observation space into separate subspaces, each

Matching games constitute a fundamental class of cooperative games which help
understand and model auctions and assignments. In a matching game, the value of
a coalition of vertices is the weight of the maximum size matching in the
subgraph induced by the coalition. The Shapley value is one of the most
important solution concepts in cooperative game theory.
  After establishing some general insights, we show that the Shapley value of
matching games can be computed in polynomial time for some special cases:
graphs with maximum degree two, and graphs that have a small modular
decomposition into cliques or cocliques (complete k-partite graphs are a
notable special case of this). The latter result extends to various other
well-known classes of graph-based cooperative games.

matching games is #P-complete in general. Finally, a fully polynomial-time
randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS) is presented. This FPRAS can be
considered the best positive result conceivable, in view of the #P-completeness

from ionized gas, and absorption lines from hydride molecules (OH+, H2O+, H2O,
CH+, CH, SH+, HF, NH, NH2, and NH3). The rotational population diagrams of CO
suggest the presence of two gas temperature components: an extended warm
component, which is associated with the extended envelope, and a hotter
component, which is seen towards the B2(M) and B2(N) cores. As observed in
other Galactic Center clouds, the gas temperatures are significantly higher
than the dust temperatures inferred from photometric images. We determined
far-IR and total dust masses in the cores. Non-local thermodynamic equilibrium
models of the CO excitation were used to constrain the averaged gas density in
the cores. A uniform luminosity ratio is measured along the extended envelope,
suggesting that the same mechanism dominates the heating of the molecular gas
at large scales. The detection of high-density molecular tracers and of strong
[N II] 205 um line emission towards the cores suggests that their morphology
must be clumpy to allow UV radiation to escape from the inner HII regions.
Together with shocks, the strong UV radiation field is likely responsible for
the heating of the hot CO component. At larger scales, photodissociation
regions models can explain both the observed CO line ratios and the uniform
L(CO)/LFIR luminosity ratios.

moments of the frequency spectrum. We show that these moments can be determined
analytically if a population has experienced two instantaneous size changes in
the past. We apply our method to data from ten human populations gathered in
the 1000 genomes project, estimate their demographies and define
demography-adjusted versions of Tajima's $D$, Fay & Wu's $H$, and Zeng's $E$.
The adjusted test statistics facilitate the direct comparison between

by Maggiore, we obtain the quantum entropy and area spectra of these BHs.
Although the QNM frequencies are tuned by ""a"", we show that the quantum spectra

matrix to replace the NCS. This paper makes three contributions. First, we show
that not all the hosts need an independent network coordinate (NC). On the

we present an Internet Delay Matrix Service (IDMS) for representing network
distances without explicit measurements in Internet. Third, we describe two
delay matrices up to date delay matrix (UDM) and previous delay matrices (PDM)
for representing the network distances. Extensive simulations on our collected
Chinese Internet data sets show that IDMS is an accurate, efficient, scalable
and practical method for Chinese Internet. The performance of IDMS is better

Such time-dependent potential drives nuclear motion and fully accounts for the
coupling to the electronic subsystem. We investigate the features of the
potential in the context of electronic non-adiabatic processes and employ it to
study the performance of the classical approximation on nuclear dynamics. We
observe that the potential, after the nuclear wave-packet splits at an avoided
crossing, develops dynamical steps connecting different regions, along the
nuclear coordinate, in which it has the same slope as one or the other
adiabatic surface. A detailed analysis of these steps is presented for systems
with different non-adiabatic coupling strength. The exact factorization of the
electron-nuclear wave-function is at the basis of the decomposition. In
particular, the nuclear part is the true nuclear wave-function, solution of a
time-dependent Schroedinger euqation and leading to the exact many-body density
and current density. As a consequence, the Ehrenfest theorem can be extended to
the nuclear subsystem and Hamiltonian, as discussed here with an analytical
derivation and numerical results.

rates of the initial color fields are given by the Schwinger formula, and the
collision terms are treated in the relaxation-time approximation. By connecting
the relaxation time with viscosity we are able to study production and
thermalization processes in the plasma characterized by different values of the
ratio of the shear viscosity to entropy density, eta/s. For the lowest (KSS)
value of this ratio, 4 pi eta/s = 1, and realistic initial conditions for the
fields, the system approaches the viscous-hydrodynamics regime within 1-2 fm/c.
On the other hand, for larger values of the viscosity, 4 pi eta/s greater or

collective phenomena which manifest themselves as oscillations of different
plasma parameters. The presence of such oscillations brings in differences
between the kinetic and hydrodynamic descriptions, which suggest that the
viscous-hydrodynamics approach after 1-2 fm/c is not complete if 4 pi eta/s is
greater or equal to 3 and should be extended to include dissipative phenomena

its internal quark-gluon configuration by the constituent-counting rule in
perturbative QCD. In particular, the cross section for the exclusive process
$\pi^- + p \to K^0 + \Lambda (1405)$ is estimated at the scattering angle
$\theta=90^\circ$ in the center-of-mass frame by using current experimental
data. In comparison, the cross section for the ground-state $\Lambda$
production $\pi^- + p \to K^0 + \Lambda$ is also shown. We suggest that the
internal quark configuration of $\Lambda (1405)$ should be determined by the
asymptotic scaling behavior of the cross section. If it is an ordinary
three-quark baryon, the scaling of the cross section is $s^{8} d\sigma
/dt=$constant, whereas it is $s^{10} d\sigma /dt=$constant if $\Lambda (1405)$
is a five-quark hadron, where $s$ and $t$ are Mandelstam variables. Such a
measurement will be possible, for example, by using the high-momentum beamline
at J-PARC. In addition, another exclusive process $\gamma + p \to K^+ + \Lambda
(1405)$ could be investigated at LEPS and JLab for finding the nature of
$\Lambda (1405)$. We indicate that the constituent-counting rule could be used
as a valuable quantity in determining internal structure of exotic hadrons by
high-energy exclusive processes, where quark-gluon degrees of freedom
explicitly appear. Furthermore, it is interesting to investigate the transition
from hadron degrees of freedom to quark-gluon ones for exclusive exotic-hadron
production processes.

graph (DAG) model from observational data. A number of constraint-based,
score-based and hybrid algorithms have been developed for this purpose. For
constraint-based methods, statistical consistency guarantees typically rely on
the faithfulness assumption, which has been show to be restrictive especially
for graphs with cycles in the skeleton. However, there is only limited work on
consistency guarantees for score-based and hybrid algorithms and it has been
unclear whether consistency guarantees can be proven under weaker conditions
than the faithfulness assumption. In this paper, we propose the sparsest
permutation (SP) algorithm. This algorithm is based on finding the causal
ordering of the variables that yields the sparsest DAG. We prove that this new
score-based method is consistent under strictly weaker conditions than the
faithfulness assumption. We also demonstrate through simulations on small DAGs
that the SP algorithm compares favorably to the constraint-based PC and SGS
algorithms as well as the score-based Greedy Equivalence Search and hybrid
Max-Min Hill-Climbing method. In the Gaussian setting, we prove that our
algorithm boils down to finding the permutation of the variables with sparsest
Cholesky decomposition for the inverse covariance matrix. Using this
connection, we show that in the oracle setting, where the true covariance
matrix is known, the SP algorithm is in fact equivalent to $\ell_0$-penalized
maximum likelihood estimation.

small-scale organisms including various single-cell eukaryotes and nematodes.
In this work, we report a comprehensive study of undulatory locomotion of a
finite filament using (i) approximate resistive force theory (RFT) assuming a
local nature of hydrodynamic interaction between the filament and the
surrounding viscous liquid, and (ii) particle-based numerical computations
taking into account the intra-filament hydrodynamic interaction. Using the
ubiquitous model of a propagating sinusoidal waveform, we identify the limit of
applicability of the RFT and determine the optimal propulsion gait in terms of
(i) swimming distance per period of undulation and (ii) hydrodynamic propulsion
efficiency. The occurrence of the optimal swimming gait maximizing hydrodynamic
efficiency at finite wavelength in particle-based computations diverges from
the prediction of the RFT. To compare the model swimmer powered by sine wave
undulations to biological undulatory swimmers, we apply the particle-based
approach to study locomotion of the model organism nematode Caenorhabditis
elegans using the swimming gait extracted from experiments. The analysis
reveals that even though the amplitude and the wavenumber of undulations are
similar to those determined for the best performing sinusoidal swimmer, C.
elegans overperforms the latter in terms of both displacement and hydrodynamic
efficiency. Further comparison with other undulatory microorganisms reveals
that many adopt waveforms with characteristics similar to the optimal model
swimmer, yet real swimmers still manage to beat the best performing sine-wave
swimmer in terms of distance covered per period. Overall our results underline
the importance of further waveform optimization, as periodic undulations
adopted by C. elegans and other organisms deviate considerably from a simple
sine wave.

scenario, where the first and second family squarks are very heavy, ${\cal

input the experimental data of the CP violations of $K$, $B^0$, and $B_s$
mesons, that is $\epsilon_K$, $\phi_d$, and $\phi_s$. The experimental upper
bound of the chromo-EDM of the strange quark is also input. In addition, we
take account of the observed values $\Delta M_{B^0}$, $\Delta M_{B_s}$, the CKM
mixing $|V_{ub}|$, and the branching ratio of $b\to s\gamma$. The allowed
region of the mixing parameters are obtained as $|\delta_{13}^{dL(dR)}|=0\sim
0.01$ and $|\delta_{23}^{dL(dR)}|=0\sim 0.04$. By using these values, the
deviations from the SM are estimated in the CP violations of the $B^0$ and
$B_s$ decays. The deviation from the SM one is tiny in the CP asymmetries of
$B^0\to \phi K_S$ and $B^0\to \eta 'K^0$ due to the chromo-EDM of the strange
quark. On the other hand, the CP asymmetries $B_s \to \phi \phi$ and $B_s \to

the time dependent CP asymmetry of $B^0\to K^0\bar K^0$ and the semi-leptonic
CP asymmetries of $B^0 \to \mu ^-X$ and $B_s \to \mu ^-X$. We expect those
precise measurements at Belle II, which will provide us interesting tests for

emerged from the results of long-distance communication tests performed by Karl
Jansky in the early 1930's. The roots of this technology extend back beyond
Marconi, although the first electronically scanned instrument only appeared in
the run-up to World War II. After the war, phased arrays had a major impact in
many walks of life, including astronomy and astrophysics. Major progress was
made in understanding the nature of the radio sky, including the discovery of
Pulsars. Despite these early successes, parabolic dishes largely replaced
aperture arrays through the 1960's, and right up until the end of the 20th
century. Technological advances in areas such as signal processing, digital
electronics, low-power/high performance super-computing and large capacity data
storage systems have recently led to a substantial revival in the use of
aperture arrays - especially at frequencies below 300 MHz. Composed of simple
antennas with commercially available low-noise room-temperature amplifiers,
aperture arrays with huge collecting areas can be synthesized at relatively low
cost. Multiple beams (or multiple fields-of-view) can be rapidly formed and
electronically steered across the sky. As astronomers begin to grapple with
these new possibilities, the next goal is to see these systems move to higher
GHz frequencies. Aperture Arrays operating at frequencies of up to 1.7 GHz are
expected to form a substantial part of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA).

which is also a dominant low-frequency peak near or equal to the rotational
frequency. These 46 frequencies range up to 146 c/d. Three years of Kepler data
reveal distinct sequences of these equidistantly spaced frequencies, including
the basic sequence and side lobes associated with other dominant modes (i.e.,
small amplitude modulations). The amplitudes of the basic sequence show a
high-low pattern. The basic sequence follows the equation fm = 2.8519 + m *
2.81421 c/d with m ranging from 25 to 35. The zero-point offset and the lack of
low-order harmonics eliminate an interpretation in terms of a Fourier series of
a non-sinusoidal light curve. The exactness of the spacing eliminates
high-order asymptotic pulsation. The frequency pattern is not compatible with
simple hypotheses involving single or multiple spots, even with differential
rotation. The basic high-frequency sequence is interpreted in terms of prograde
sectoral modes. These can be marginally unstable, while their corresponding
low-degree counterparts are stable due to stronger damping. The measured
projected rotation velocity (300 km/s) indicates that the star rotates with
app. 70% of the Keplerian break-up velocity. This suggests a near equator-on
view. We qualitatively examine the visibility of prograde sectoral high-degree
g-modes in integrated photometric light in such a geometrical configuration and
find that prograde sectoral modes can reproduce the frequencies and the
odd-even amplitude pattern of the high-frequency sequence.

ejected as a result of rapid increase in stellar luminosity. In general
relativity (GR), radiation pressure from the central luminous star counteracts
gravitational attraction more strongly than in Newtonian physics. However,
motion near the neutron star is very effectively impeded by the radiation
field. We discuss coronal ejection in a general relativistic calculation of the
motion of a test particle in a spherically symmetric radiation field. At every
radial distance from the star larger than that of the ISCO, and any initial
luminosity of the star, there exists a luminosity change which leads to coronal
ejection. The luminosity required to eject from the system the inner parts of
the optically thin neutron-star corona is very high in the presence of
radiation drag and always close to the Eddington luminosity. Outer parts of the
corona, at a distance of ~20 $R_G$ or more, will be ejected by a sub-Eddington
outburst. Mildly fluctuating luminosity will lead to dissipation in the plasma
and may explain the observed X-ray temperatures of coronae in low mass X-ray
binaries (LMXBs). At large radial distances from the star ($3\cdot 10^3 R_G$ or
more) the results do not depend on whether or not Poynting-Robertson drag is

soft-overlap (or soft) contributions. These terms can be naturally introduced
within the SCET framework as a matrix elements of the SCET-I operators. The
so-called end-point singularities must cancel in the sum of the hard and soft
contributions after matching onto SCET-II. Using the so-called physical
subtraction scheme we demonstrated such a cancellation in the case of twist-3
chiral enhanced contributions in the leading logarithmic approximation.
  As a result we obtained the well defined expression for the subleading power
correction which depends only from the two unknown functions. These functions
can be associated with the soft-overlap of the outgoing pion state and
therefore does not depend on the scattering angle. The angular dependence in
this case is defined by the hard subprocess and can be computed in a model
independent way.
  The obtained results were used in the phenomenological analysis of existing

interpretation of the emission line is complex and we explore three
possibilities. If originating from ionized disc reflection, this should be
emitted at r_in> 50r_g or, in the lamp-post configuration, the illuminating
source should be at a height of h> 30r_g over the black hole. Alternatively,
the line could be modeled with a hot collisionally ionized plasma with
temperature kT = 22.0^{+6.1}_{-3.2} keV or a photo-ionized plasma with
log\xi=4.52^{+0.10}_{-0.16} erg s^{-1} cm and column density N_H > 3x10^23

exist on moduli spaces of maps $Map(S,X)$, also called the space of branes of
$X$ with respect $S$. These operations will be constructed as operations on the
(quasi-coherent) derived category $\D(Map(S,X))$, in the particular case where
$S$ has some close relations with an operad $\OO$. More precisely, for an
$\s$-operad $\OO$ and an algebraic variety $X$ (or more generally a derived
algebraic stack), satisfying some natural conditions, we prove that $\OO$ acts
on the object $\OO(2)$ by mean cospans. This universal action is used to prove
that $\OO$ acts on the derived category of the space of maps $Map(\OO(2),X)$,
which will call the brane operations. We apply the existence of these
operations, as well as their naturality in $\OO$, in order to propose a sketch
for a proof of the \emph{higher formality conjecture}, a far reaching extension
of Konstevich's formality's theorem. By doing so we present a positive answer
to a conjecture of Kapustin (see \cite[p. 14]{kap}), relating polyvector fields
on a variety $X$ and deformations of the mono/""i dal derived category $\D(X)$.

Ni 3d band complex is hybridized with C $2p$ and Th character to and through
the Fermi level ($E_f$), and a sharply structured density of states arises only
when spin-orbit coupling is included, which splits a zone-center degeneracy
leaving a very flat band edge lying at the Fermi level. The flat part of the
band corresponds to an effective mass $m^*_{z} \rightarrow \infty$ with large

mass characterization applies is less than 1% of the zone volume, it yet
supplies of the order of half the states at (or just above) the Fermi level.
The observed increase of T$_c$ by hole-doping is accounted for if the reference
as-synthesized sample is minutely hole-doped, which decreases the Fermi level
density of states and will provide some stabilization. In this scenario,
electron doping will increase the Fermi level density of states and the
superconducting critical temperature. Vibrational properties are presented, and
enough coupling to the C-Ni-C stretch mode at 70 meV is obtained to imply that
superconductivity is electron-phonon mediated.

compressed sensing to provide rigorous non asymptotic recovery guarantees,
quantifying the impact of the input sparsity level, the input sparsity basis,
and the network characteristics on the system capacity. Our analysis
demonstrates that network memory capacities can scale superlinearly with the
number of nodes, and in some situations can achieve STM capacities that are
much larger than the network size. We provide perfect recovery guarantees for
finite sequences and recovery bounds for infinite sequences. The latter
analysis predicts that network STM systems may have an optimal recovery length

that the conditions yielding optimal STM capacity can be embodied in several

of the local stress increase x that would lead to an instability. We argue that
this distribution is singular P(x)x^{\theta}, where the exponent {\theta} is
non-zero if the elastic interaction between rearranging regions is
non-monotonic, and increases with the interaction range. For a class of finite
dimensional models we show that stability implies a lower bound on {\theta},
which is found to lie near saturation. For quadrupolar interactions these
models yield {\theta} ~ 0.6 for d=2 and \theta ~ 0.4 in d=3 where d is the
spatial dimension, accurately capturing previously unresolved observations in
atomistic models, both in quasi-static flow and after a fast quench.

visit, gaining a boost in velocity by extracting energy from the star's motion
around the Galactic Centre. These maneouvres carry little to no extra energy
cost, and in previous work it has been shown that a single Voyager-like probe
exploring the galaxy does so 100 times faster when carrying out these
slingshots than when navigating purely by powered flight (Forgan et al. 2012).
We expand on these results by repeating the experiment with self-replicating
probes. The probes explore a box of stars representative of the local Solar
neighbourhood, to investigate how self-replication affects exploration
timescales when compared with a single non-replicating probe.
  We explore three different scenarios of probe behaviour: i) standard powered
flight to the nearest unvisited star (no slingshot techniques used), ii) flight
to the nearest unvisited star using slingshot techniques, and iii) flight to
the next unvisited star that will give the maximum velocity boost under a
slingshot trajectory.
  In all three scenarios we find that as expected, using self-replicating
probes greatly reduces the exploration time, by up to three orders of magnitude
for scenario i) and iii) and two orders of magnitude for ii). The second case
(i.e. nearest-star slingshots) remains the most time effective way to explore a
population of stars. As the decision-making algorithms for the fleet are
simple, unanticipated ""race conditions"" amongst probes are set up, causing the
exploration time of the final stars to become much longer than necessary. From
the scaling of the probes' performance with star number, we conclude that a
fleet of self-replicating probes can indeed explore the Galaxy in a
sufficiently short time to warrant the existence of the Fermi Paradox.

understood so their potential use as independent clocks to test the spin-down
ages of pulsars or as probes of the extreme environments in which low mass

radius measurements for the precursor to a low mass white dwarf. We find that
only models in which this star has a thick hydrogen envelope can match the
strong constraints provided by our new observations. Very cool low mass white
dwarfs must therefore have lost their thick hydrogen envelopes by irradiation
from pulsar companions or by episodes of unstable hydrogen fusion (shell
flashes). We also find that this low mass white dwarf precursor is a new type
of pulsating star. The observed pulsation frequencies are sensitive to internal
processes that determine whether this star will undergo shell flashes.

spectroscopy. This sample covers well the less studied LIRG luminosity range
and includes isolated disks, interacting systems, and mergers. The majority of
the galaxies have two main kinematically distinct components. One component
(i.e., narrow or systemic) extends over the whole line-emitting region and is
characterized by small to intermediate velocity dispersions (i.e., sigma from
30 to 160 km s^-1). It traces the overall velocity field. The second component
(broad) has in general a larger velocity dispersion (up to 320 km s^-1), mainly
found in the inner regions and generally blueshifted with respect to the
systemic component. Most of the objects (76%) are dominated by rotation, more
relevant in LIRGs than in ULIRGs. Isolated disks, interacting galaxies, and
merging systems define a sequence of increasing mean velocity dispersion, and
decreasing velocity field amplitude.The LIRGs classified as isolated disks have
similar velocity amplitudes but larger mean velocity dispersions (44 vs. 24 km
s^-1) than local spirals, implying a larger turbulence and thicker disks.
Interacting systems and mergers have values closer to those of low velocity
dispersion ellipticals/lenticular galaxies (E/SOs). The (U)LIRGs classified as
mergers have kinematic properties similar to those shown by the Lyman break
analogs (LBAs). The dynamical masses range from \sim 0.04 m* to 1.4 m* (i.e.,
m* = 1.4x10^{11} Msun), with ULIRGs (M{dyn} sim 0.5 +/- 0.2 m*) being more
massive than LIRGs by, on average, a factor of about 2. The mass ratio of
individual pre-coalescence galaxies is <2.5 for most of the systems, confirming

the surprising results that if we remove all candidates excluded by the

equations and solution of the underlying eigenvalue problem, we obtain
excitations beyond available theories of excitation spectra, such as the
Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equations. The derived theory is first applied to
study BECs in a one-dimensional harmonic potential. The LR-MCTDHB method
contains the BdG excitations and, also, predicts a plethora of additional
many-body excitations which are out of the realm of standard linear response.
In particular, our theory describes the exact energy of the higher harmonic of
the first (dipole) excitation not contained in the BdG theory. We next study a
BEC in a very shallow one-dimensional double-well potential. We find with
LR-MCTDHB low-lying excitations which are not accounted for by BdG, even though
the BEC has only little fragmentation and, hence, the BdG theory is expected to
be valid. The convergence of the LR-MCTDHB theory is assessed by systematically
comparing the excitation spectra computed at several different levels of

techniques developed for gravity inversion can be divided into Monte Carlo
methods, matrix inversion methods, and spectral methods. Here we employ both
matrix inversion and Monte Carlo in order to explore the space of exact
solutions, in a method which is particularly suited for arbitrary shape bodies.
We expand the mass density function using orthogonal polynomials, and map the
contribution of each term to the global gravitational field generated. This map
is linear in the density terms, and can be pseudo-inverted in the
under-determined regime using QR decomposition, to obtain a basis of the affine
space of exact interior structure solutions. As the interior structure
solutions are degenerate, assumptions have to be made in order to control their
properties, and these assumptions can be transformed into scalar functions and
used to explore the solutions space using Monte Carlo techniques. Sample
applications show that the range of solutions tend to converge towards the
nominal one as long as the generic assumptions made are correct, even in the

traced by the far-IR (FIR) to UV ratio, to the observed UV color, indicated by
beta. Previous research has indicated that while starburst galaxies exhibit a
relatively tight IRX-beta relation, normal star-forming galaxies do not, and
have a much larger spread in the total-IR to far-UV (FUV) luminosity for a
fixed UV color. We examine the role that the age of the stellar population
plays as the ""second parameter"" responsible for the observed deviation and
spread of star-forming galaxies from the starburst relation. We model the FUV
to FIR spectral energy distribution (SED) of each galaxy according to two broad
bins of star formation history (SFH): constant and instantaneous burst. We find
clear trends between stellar population mean age estimators
(extinction-corrected FUV/NIR, U-B, and EW(H-alpha)) and the UV color, beta;
the trends are mostly driven by the galaxies best-described by instantaneous
burst populations. We also find a significant correlation between beta and the
mean age directly determined from the best-fit instantaneous models. As already
indicated by other authors, the UV attenuation in star-forming galaxies may not
be recovered with the UV color alone and is highly influenced by the stellar
population's mean age and SFH. Overall, the scatter in the IRX-beta diagram is
better correlated with beta than with the perpendicular distance.

  Methods. A multi-wavelength analysis of the Monoceros R2 region is carried

Even before the discovery of the neutron, he postulated the possible existence
of stars more compact than white dwarfs, containing matter of the order of
nuclear density. From a modern point of view neutron stars are compact objects
maintained by the equilibrium between gravity and the degeneracy pressure of
the fermions together with a strong nuclear repulsion force due to the high
density reached in their interior. While the physics in the vicinity of nuclear
saturation density is well know from phenomenology, the physics of ultra-dense
nuclear matter is still an open puzzle. In this work we study dense nuclear
matter within a relativistic model, allowing hyperons to be present through
beta equilibrium. The presence of hyperons is justifiable since the
constituents of neutron stars are fermions. So, according to the Pauli
principle, as the baryon density increases, so do the Fermi momentum and the
Fermi energy. On the other hand, this hyperonic matter softens the equation of
state (EoS) and a recent measurement of pulsar PSR J1614-2230 implies that the
EoS has to be stiff enough to produce a 2.0 $M_{\odot}$ pulsar. We also
consider Duncan's magnetar ideas and study the influence of strong magnetic
fields on the EoS. We see that a strong magnetic field produces very massive
neutron stars, in agreement with the astronomical observations.

Surprisingly, and somewhat reminiscent of the doped high-T_{c} cuprates,
carrier localization is found to persist upon weak hole doping because the
chemical potential lies in a gap structure wit almost vanishing
density-of-states (DOS). On the other hand, in remarkable contrast, electron
doping drives an orbital-selective metallic phase (OSMP) with co-existing
pseudogapped (Mott localized) and itinerant carriers. These remarkably

sections to each fixed-order in perturbative QCD. Generically, ratios of
IRC-safe observables are themselves not IRC safe and do not have a valid
fixed-order expansion. Nevertheless, in this paper we present an explicit
method to calculate the cross section for a ratio observable in perturbative
QCD with the help of resummation. We take the IRC-safe jet angularities as an
example and consider the ratio formed from two angularities with different
angular exponents. While the ratio observable is not IRC safe, it is ""Sudakov
safe"", meaning that the perturbative Sudakov factor exponentially suppresses
the singular region of phase space. At leading logarithmic (LL) order, the
distribution is finite but has a peculiar expansion in the square root of the
strong coupling constant, a consequence of IRC unsafety. The accuracy of the LL
distribution can be further improved with higher-order resummation and
fixed-order matching. Non-perturbative effects can sometimes give rise to order
one changes in the distribution, but at sufficiently high energies Q, Sudakov
safety leads to non-perturbative corrections that scale like a (fractional)
power of 1/Q, as is familiar for IRC-safe observables. We demonstrate that
Monte Carlo parton showers give reliable predictions for the ratio observable,
and we discuss the prospects for computing other ratio observables using our
method.

light in the centres of rich clusters. In this paper we investigate the number
of mergers onto BCGs in 14 X-ray selected clusters over the redshift range 0.8
< z < 1.4 using HST imaging data. We find significant differences in the
numbers of companion galaxies to BCGs between the clusters in our sample
indicating that BCGs in similar mass clusters can have very different merging
histories. Within a 50 kpc radius around the BCGs we find an average of 6.45
\pm 1.15 companion galaxies with mass ratios (companion:BCG) between 1:1 and
1:20. The infalling companions show a 50/50 split between major (1:1 - 1:2) and
minor (1:3 - 1:20) mergers. When compared to similar work using lower redshift
clusters, these results demonstrate that both major and minor merging was more
common in the past. Since the dynamical timescales for merging onto the BCG are
relatively short compared with the look-back time to z ~ 1 our results suggest
that the BCG stellar mass may increase by as much as 1.8 times since z = 1.
However the growth rate of BCGs will be substantially less if stripped material
from nearby companions ends up in the diffuse intracluster light.

explore a novel solution involving ultra-light axions that can potentially
resolve the missing satellites problem, the cusp-core problem, and the `too big
to fail' problem. We discuss approximations to non-linear structure formation
in dark matter models containing a component of ultra-light axions across four
orders of magnitude in mass, $10^{-24}\text{ eV}\lesssim m_a \lesssim
10^{-20}\text{ eV}$, a range too heavy to be well constrained by linear
cosmological probes such as the CMB and matter power spectrum, and too
light/non-interacting for other astrophysical or terrestrial axion searches. We
find that an axion of mass $m_a\approx 10^{-21}\text{ eV}$ contributing
approximately $85\%$ of the total dark matter can introduce a significant kpc
scale core in a typical Milky Way satellite galaxy in sharp contrast to a
thermal relic with a transfer function cut off at the same scale, while still
allowing such galaxies to form in significant number. Therefore ultra-light
axions do not suffer from the \emph{Catch 22} that applies to using a warm dark
matter as a solution to the small scale problems of cold dark matter. Our model
simultaneously allows formation of enough high redshift galaxies to allow
reconciliation with observational constraints, and also reduces the maximum
circular velocities of massive dwarfs so that baryonic feedback may more
plausibly resolve the predicted overproduction of massive MWG dwarf satellites.

cooling by increasing the interaction strength for homogeneous as well as for

efficient at finite doping than at half filling. That, in turn, leads to an
efficient adiabatic cooling in the presence of a trap which, starting with even
relatively high entropies, can drive the system to have a Mott insulating phase
with substantial antiferromagnetic correlations.

used in practical settings. When the random variable of interest is normally
distributed, the first order loss function can be easily expressed in terms of
the standard normal cumulative distribution and probability density function.
However, the standard normal cumulative distribution does not admit a closed
form solution and cannot be easily linearised. Several works in the literature
discuss approximations for either the standard normal cumulative distribution
or the first order loss function and their inverse. However, a comprehensive
study on piecewise linear upper and lower bounds for the first order loss
function is still missing. In this work, we initially summarise a number of
distribution independent results for the first order loss function and its
complementary function. We then extend this discussion by focusing first on
random variable featuring a symmetric distribution, and then on normally
distributed random variables. For the latter, we develop effective piecewise
linear upper and lower bounds that can be immediately embedded in MILP models.
These linearisations rely on constant parameters that are independent of the
mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution of interest. We finally
discuss how to compute optimal linearisation parameters that minimise the
maximum approximation error.

velocity component not seen in observations from the ground of CO or other

conditions and physical origin. A velocity component with an offset of ~10 km/s
detected in spectra of the H2O 110-101 557 GHz transition towards six low-mass
protostars in the 'Water in star-forming regions with Herschel' (WISH)
programme is also seen in higher-excited H2O lines. The emission from this
component is quantified and excitation conditions are inferred using 1D slab
models. Data are compared to observations of hydrides (high-J CO, OH+, CH+, C+,
OH) where the same component is uniquely detected. The velocity component is
detected in all 6 targeted H2O transitions (Eup~50-250K), and in CO 16-15
towards one source, Ser SMM1. Inferred excitation conditions imply that the
emission arises in dense (n~5x10^6-10^8 cm^-3) and hot (T~750K) gas. The H2O
and CO column densities are ~10^16 and 10^18 cm^-2, respectively, implying a
low H2O abundance of 10^-2 with respect to CO. The high column densities of
ions such as OH+ and CH+ (both ~10^13 cm^-2) indicate an origin close to the
protostar where the UV field is strong enough that these species are abundant.
The estimated radius of the emitting region is 100AU. This component likely
arises in dissociative shocks close to the protostar, an interpretation
corroborated by a comparison with models of such shocks. Furthermore, one of
the sources, IRAS4A, shows temporal variability in the offset component over a
period of two years which is expected from shocks in dense media. High-J CO gas
detected with Herschel-PACS with Trot~700K is identified as arising in the same
component and traces the part of the shock where H2 reforms. Thus, H2O reveals
new dynamical components, even on small spatial scales in low-mass protostars.

associating Bertschinger's Poisson gauge with a Eulerian/observer's frame of

relativistic cosmological structure formation. Explicitly, we begin with the
second-order solution of the Einstein equations in a synchronous/comoving
coordinate system---which defines the Lagrangian frame, and transform it to a
Poissonian coordinate system. The generating vector of this coordinate/gauge
transformation is found to be the relativistic displacement field. The metric
perturbations in the Poissonian coordinate system contain known results from
standard/Eulerian Newtonian perturbation theory, but contain also purely
relativistic corrections. On sub-horizon scales these relativistic corrections
are dominated by the Newtonian bulk part. These corrections however set up
non-linear constraints for the density and for the velocity which become
important on scales close to the horizon. Furthermore, we report the occurence
of a transverse component in the displacement field, and find that it induces a
non-linear frame dragging as seen in the observer's frame, which is

and negative differential spin Seebeck effects in magnon tunneling junctions.
When magnonic junctions have temperature-dependent density of states, reversing
the temperature bias is able to give asymmetric spin currents and increasing
temperature bias could give an anomalously decreasing magnonic spin current. We
show that these properties are relevant for building spin Seebeck diodes and
transistors, which could play important roles in controlling information and
energy in magnonics and spin caloritronics.

galactic nuclei. A gold standard of the orientation paradigm is the hypothesis
that radio galaxies and radio-loud quasars are intrinsically the same, but are
observed over different ranges of viewing angles. Historically, strong support
for this model was provided by the projected sizes of radio structure in
luminous radio galaxies, which were found to be significantly larger than those
of quasars, as predicted due to simple geometric projection. Recently, this
test of the simplest prediction of orientation-based models has been revisited
with larger samples that cover wider ranges of fundamental properties---and no
clear difference in projected sizes of radio structure is found. Cast solely in
terms of viewing angle effects, these results provide convincing evidence that
unification of these objects solely through orientation fails. However, it is
possible that conflicting results regarding the role orientation plays in our
view of radio sources simply result from insufficient sampling of their
intrinsic size distribution. We test this possibility using Monte-Carlo
simulations constrained by real sample sizes and properties. We develop models
for the real intrinsic size distribution of radio sources, simulate
observations by randomly sampling intrinsic sizes and viewing angles, and
analyze how likely each sample is to support or dispute unification by
orientation. We find that, while it is possible to reconcile conflicting
results purely within a simple, orientation-based framework, it is very
unlikely. We analyze the effects that sample size, relative numbers of radio
galaxies and quasars, the critical angle that separates the two subclasses, and
the shape of the intrinsic size distribution have on this type of test.

strength of reflection; we find R<1.4 for \Gamma=1.8, broadly consistent with
that found for local AGNs observed at >10 keV. We also constrain the host
galaxy masses and find a median stellar mass of ~10^{11} M_sun, a factor ~5
times higher than the median stellar mass of nearby high-energy selected AGNs,
which may be at least partially driven by the order of magnitude higher X-ray
luminosities of the NuSTAR sources. Within the low source-statistic limitations

factors affecting the interaction dynamics and the resulting competition that
may occur at different scales, from the within-host scale to the spatial
structure and mobility of the host population. Here we study the dynamics of
two competing pathogens in a structured host population and assess the impact
of the mobility pattern of hosts on the pathogen competition. We model the
spatial structure of the host population in terms of a metapopulation network
and focus on two strains imported locally in the system and having the same
transmission potential but different infectious periods. We find different
scenarios leading to competitive success of either one of the strain or to the
codominance of both strains in the system. The dominance of the strain
characterized by the shorter or longer infectious period depends exclusively on
the structure of the population and on the the mobility of hosts across
patches. The proposed modeling framework allows the integration of other
relevant epidemiological, environmental and demographic factors opening the
path to further mathematical and computational studies of the dynamics of

and clinicians in searching for diseases, primarily cancer. Scans might be
acquired at different times, with patient movement between scans, or with
different equipment, resulting in multiple datasets that need to be registered.
For this issue, we introduce a registration method using anatomical
feature-guided mutual information. Prostate scans of the same patient taken in
three different orientations are first aligned for the accurate detection of
anatomical features in 3D. Then, our pipeline allows for multiple modalities
registration through the use of anatomical features, such as the interior
urethra of prostate and gland utricle, in a bijective way. The novelty of this
approach is the application of anatomical features as the pre-specified
corresponding landmarks for prostate registration. We evaluate the registration
results through both artificial and clinical datasets. Registration accuracy is
evaluated by performing statistical analysis of local intensity differences or
spatial differences of anatomical landmarks between various MR datasets.
Evaluation results demonstrate that our method statistics-significantly
improves the quality of registration. Although this strategy is tested for
MRI-guided brachytherapy, the preliminary results from these experiments
suggest that it can be also applied to other settings such as transrectal
ultrasound-guided or CT-guided therapy, where the integration of preoperative
MRI may have a significant impact upon treatment planning and guidance.

Cenozoic makes it an excellent natural laboratory to study recent large-scale
variations in surface topography, and processes that influence changes in its
elevation. Embedded within this topography is a fluvial network that is
sensitive to variations in horizontal and vertical motions. The notion that a
river acts as a 'tape recorder' for vertical perturbations suggests that
changes in spatial and temporal characteristics of surface uplift can be
deduced through the analysis of longitudinal river profiles. We analyse 20
longitudinal river profiles around the Australian continent. Concave upward
profiles in northeast Australia indicate an absence of recent surface uplift.
In contrast, the major knickzones within longitudinal profiles of rivers in
southwest Australia suggest recent surface uplift. Given the lack of recent
large-scale tectonic activity in that region, this uplift requires an
explanation. Applying an inverse algorithm to river profiles of south Western
Australia reveals that this surface uplift started in the Eocene and culminated
in the mid-late Neogene. The surface uplift rates deduced from this river
profile analysis generally agree with independent geological observations
including preserved shallow-marine sediment outcrops across the Eucla Basin and
south Western Australia. We show that the interplay between global sea level
and long-wavelength dynamic topography associated with south Western
Australia's plate motion path over the remnants of an ancient Pacific slab is a
plausible mechanism driving this surface uplift.

realized for a long time, but still hides several questions and problems to be
solved. Some of binary star clusters are formed by close encounter, but the
others are formed together from similar womb. Some of them undergo separation
process, while the others are in the middle of merger toward common future. The
products of merger binary star cluster have typical characteristics which
differ from solo clusters, especially in their spatial distribution and their
stellar members kinematics. On the other hand, these merger products still have
to face dissolving processes triggered by both internal and external factors.
In this study, we performed N-body simulations of merger binary clusters with
different initial conditions. After merging, these clusters dissolve with
greater mass-loss rate because of their angular momentum. These rotating
clusters also experience more deceleration caused by external tidal field.

astronomical occurrence. Surveys are the backbone of astronomy, and many
discoveries of variable stars are the results of surveys. All-Sky Automated
Survey (ASAS) is one of the observing projects whose ultimate goal is
photometric monitoring of variable stars. Since its first light in 1997, ASAS
has collected 50,099 variable stars, with 11,076 eclipsing binaries among them.
In the present work we focus on the period determination of the eclipsing
binaries. Since the number of data points in each ASAS eclipsing binary light
curve is sparse, period determination of any system is a not straightforward
process. For 30 samples of such systems we compare the implementation of
Lomb-Scargle algorithm which is an Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) basis and Phase
Dispersion Minimization (PDM) method which is non-FFT basis to determine their
period. It is demonstrated that PDM gives better performance at handling
eclipsing detached (ED) systems whose variability are non-sinusoidal. More
over, using semi-automatic recipes, we get better period solution and
satisfactorily improve 53% of the selected object's light curves, but failed
against another 7% of selected objects. In addition, we also highlight 4
interesting objects for further investigation.

investigated with three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We prepare
four types of initial cloud having different density profiles and calculate
their evolution with or without a sink. To investigate the effect of magnetic
dissipation on disk formation, the Ohmic dissipation is considered in some
models. Calculations show that disk formation is very sensitive to both the
initial cloud configuration and the sink treatment. The disk size considerably
differs in clouds with different density profiles even when the initial clouds
have almost the same mass-to-flux ratio. Only a very small disk (\sim 10 AU in
size) appears in clouds with a uniform density profile, whereas a large disk
(\sim 100 AU in size) forms in clouds with a Bonnor-Ebert density profile. In
addition, a large sink accretion radius numerically impedes disk formation
during the main accretion phase and tends to foster the misleading notion that
disk formation is completely suppressed by magnetic braking. The protostellar
outflow is also greatly affected by the sink properties. A sink accretion
radius of \lesssim 1 AU and sink threshold density of \gtrsim 10^ 13 cm^-3 are
necessary for investigating disk formation during the main accretion phase.

analyzing high-dimensional data as it can reduce the number of free parameters

matrices. This paper extends the MFA model to incorporate a restricted version
of the multivariate skew-normal distribution to model the distribution of the
latent component factors, called mixtures of skew-normal factor analyzers
(MSNFA). The proposed MSNFA model allows us to relax the need for the normality
assumption for the latent factors in order to accommodate skewness in the
observed data. The MSNFA model thus provides an approach to model-based density
estimation and clustering of high-dimensional data exhibiting asymmetric
characteristics. A computationally feasible ECM algorithm is developed for
computing the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters. Model selection
can be made on the basis of three commonly used information-based criteria. The
potential of the proposed methodology is exemplified through applications to
two real examples, and the results are compared with those obtained from
fitting the MFA model.

mirror dark matter, can explain several empirical galactic scaling relations.
It is shown here that this dynamical halo model implies a quasi-isothermal dark
matter density, $\rho (r) = \rho_0 r_0^2/(r^2 + r_0^2)$, where the core radius,
$r_0$, scales with disk scale length, $r_D$, via $r_0/{\rm kpc} =

roughly $constant$, i.e. independent of galaxy size (the $constant$ is set by
the parameters of the model). The derived dark matter density profile implies
that the galactic rotation velocity satisfies the Tully-Fisher relation, $L_B
\propto v^{3}_{max}$, where $v_{max}$ is the maximal rotational velocity.
Examples of rotation curves resulting from this dynamics are given.

M_\odot$ neutron star into a $10\,M_\odot$ black hole to a maximum distance of
$\sim 900$ Mpc. Achieving this sensitivity and extracting the physics imprinted
in observed signals requires accurate modeling of the binary to construct
template waveforms. In a NSBH binary, the black hole may have significant
angular momentum (spin), which affects the phase evolution of the emitted
gravitational waves. We investigate the ability of post-Newtonian (PN)
templates to model the gravitational waves emitted during the inspiral phase of
NSBH binaries. We restrict the black hole's spin to be aligned with the orbital
angular momentum and compare several approximants. We examine restricted
amplitude waveforms that are accurate to 3.5PN order in the orbital dynamics
and complete to 2.5PN order in the spin dynamics. We also consider PN waveforms
with the recently derived 3.5PN spin-orbit and 3PN spin-orbit tail corrections.
We compare these approximants to the effective-one-body model. For all these
models, large disagreements start at low to moderate black hole spins,
particularly for binaries where the spin is anti-aligned with the orbital
angular momentum. We show that this divergence begins in the early inspiral at
$v \sim 0.2$ for $\chi_{BH} \sim 0.4$. PN spin corrections beyond those
currently known will be required for optimal detection searches and to measure
the parameters of neutron star--black hole binaries. While this complicates
searches, the strong dependence of the gravitational-wave signal on the spin
dynamics will make it possible to extract significant astrophysical
information.

quadripartite entanglement monotone, so it quantifies this localized
quadripartite entanglement. By analyzing quadripartite pure states based on the
previous classification, we find that this quadripartite entanglement monotone
is not only present in the standard GHZ state and absent in the standard W
states. In addition, based on the proposed entanglement measure, we construct a
new monogamy relation.

truthful-in-expectation ordinal mechanism implementing an outcome whose
expected social welfare is at least an Omega(m^{-3/4}) fraction of the social
welfare of the socially optimal alternative. On the other hand, we show that
for sufficiently many agents and any truthful-in-expectation ordinal mechanism,
there is a valuation profile where the mechanism achieves at most an

tighter bounds for the natural special case of m = 3, and in that case
furthermore obtain separation results concerning the approximation ratios

interacts with rock salt or ice as a detection medium, a shower is generated.
That shower is formed by hadronic and electromagnetic avalanche processes. The
energy of the UHE neutrino shower converts to thermal energy through ionization
processes. Consequently, the temperature rises along the shower produced by the
UHE neutrino. The refractive index of the medium rises with temperature. The
irregularity of the refractive index in the medium leads to a reflection of
radio waves. This reflection effect combined with the long attenuation length
of radio waves in rock salt and ice would yield a new method to detect UHE
neutrinos. We measured the phase of the reflected radio wave under irradiation
with an electron beam on ice and rock salt powder. The measured phase showed
excellent consistence with the power reflection fraction which was measured
directly. A model taking into account the temperature change explained the

multi-label classification tasks. In the RAndom k-labELsets (RAKEL) algorithm,
each member of the ensemble is associated with a small randomly-selected subset
of k labels. Then, a single label classifier is trained according to each
combination of elements in the subset. In this paper we adopt a similar
approach, however, instead of randomly choosing subsets, we select the minimum
required subsets of k labels that cover all labels and meet additional
constraints such as coverage of inter-label correlations. Construction of the
cover is achieved by formulating the subset selection as a minimum set covering
problem (SCP) and solving it by using approximation algorithms. Every cover
needs only to be prepared once by offline algorithms. Once prepared, a cover
may be applied to the classification of any given multi-label dataset whose
properties conform with those of the cover. The contribution of this paper is
two-fold. First, we introduce SCP as a general framework for constructing label
covers while allowing the user to incorporate cover construction constraints.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework by proposing two
construction constraints whose enforcement produces covers that improve the
prediction performance of random selection. Second, we provide theoretical
bounds that quantify the probabilities of random selection to produce covers
that meet the proposed construction criteria. The experimental results indicate
that the proposed methods improve multi-label classification accuracy and
stability compared with the RAKEL algorithm and to other state-of-the-art

given a set of n axis-parallel rectangles in the 2D-plane, and the goal is to

many applications, e.g. in data mining, map labeling and admission control, the
problem has received a lot of attention by various research communities. We
present the first (1+epsilon)-approximation algorithm for the MWISR problem
with quasi-polynomial running time 2^{poly(log n/epsilon)}. In contrast, the
best known polynomial time approximation algorithms for the problem achieve
superconstant approximation ratios of O(log log n) (unweighted case) and O(log
n / log log n) (weighted case).
  Key to our results is a new geometric dynamic program which recursively
subdivides the plane into polygons of bounded complexity. We provide the
technical tools that are needed to analyze its performance. In particular, we
present a method of partitioning the plane into small and simple areas such
that the rectangles of an optimal solution are intersected in a very controlled
manner. Together with a novel application of the weighted planar graph
separator theorem due to Arora et al. this allows us to upper bound our
approximation ratio by (1+epsilon).
  Our dynamic program is very general and we believe that it will be useful for
other settings. In particular, we show that, when parametrized properly, it
provides a polynomial time (1+epsilon)-approximation for the special case of
the MWISR problem when each rectangle is relatively large in at least one
dimension. Key to this analysis is a method to tile the plane in order to
approximately describe the topology of these rectangles in an optimal solution.
This technique might be a useful insight to design better polynomial time
approximation algorithms or even a PTAS for the MWISR problem.

High-energy emissions from this class of objects are believed to have been
produced by inverse Compton radiation with seed photons originating from the
broad line region. In such a paradigm, a lack of very high-energy emissions is
expected because of the Klein-Nishina effect and strong absorption in the broad
line region. Recent detection of at least three such blazars by Cherenkov
telescopes has forced a revision of our understanding of these objects. We have
aimed to model the observed spectral energy distribution of PKS 1510-089 from
the high-energy flares in March 2009, during which very high-energy emission
were also detected by H.E.S.S. We have applied the single-zone internal shock
scenario to reproduce the multiwavelength spectrum of PKS~1510-089. We have
followed the evolution of the electrons as they propagate along the jet and
emit synchrotron and inverse Compton radiation. We have considered two sources
of external photons: the dusty torus and the broad line region. We have also
examined the effects of the gamma-gamma absorption of the high-energy photons
both in the AGN environment (the broad line region and the dusty torus), as
well as while traveling over cosmological distances: the extragalactic
background light. We have successfully modeled the observed spectrum of PKS
1510-089. In our model, the highest energy emission is the result of the
Comptonization of the infrared photons from the dusty torus, thus avoiding
Klein-Nishina regime, while the bulk of the emissions in the GeV range may
still be dominated by the Comptonization of radiation coming from the broad
line region.

(CSPs), that is, a set of constraints that must be satisfied simultaneously.
Constraints can either be represented extensionally, by explicitly listing
allowed combinations of values, or implicitly, by special-purpose algorithms
provided by a solver. Such implicitly represented constraints, known as global
constraints, are widely used; indeed, they are one of the key reasons for the
success of constraint programming in solving real-world problems.
  In recent years, a variety of restrictions on the structure of CSP instances
that yield tractable classes have been identified. However, many such
restrictions fail to guarantee tractability for CSPs with global constraints.
In this paper, we investigate the properties of extensionally represented
constraints that these restrictions exploit to achieve tractability, and show
that there are large classes of global constraints that also possess these
properties. This allows us to lift these restrictions to the global case, and
identify new tractable classes of CSPs with global constraints.

thermonuclear origin with narrow hydrogen lines produced when the ejecta impact
a hydrogen-rich circumstellar medium (CSM). Our analysis, especially in the
nebular phase, reveals the presence of oxygen, magnesium and carbon features.
This suggests a core collapse explanation for SN2012ca, in contrast to the
thermonuclear interpretation proposed for some members of this group. We
suggest that the data can be explained with a hydrogen and helium deficient SN
ejecta (Type I) interacting with a hydrogen-rich CSM, but that the explosion
was more likely a Type Ic core-collapse explosion than a Type Ia thermonuclear
one. This suggests two channels (both thermonuclear and stripped envelope
core-collapse) may be responsible for these SN 1997cy-like events.

that the large AdS black holes dual to typical high-energy pure states of a
single holographic CFT must have some structure at the horizon (i.e. a
firewall/fuzzball). By weakly coupling the CFT to an auxiliary system, such a
black hole can be made to evaporate. In a case where the auxiliary system is a
second identical CFT, it is possible (for specific initial states) that the
system evolves to precisely the thermofield double state as the original black
hole evaporates. In this case, the dual geometry should include the ""late-time""
part of the eternal AdS black hole spacetime which includes smooth spacetime
behind the horizon of the original black hole. Thus, we can say that the
firewall evaporates. This provides a specific realization of the recent ideas
of Maldacena and Susskind that the existence of smooth spacetime behind the
horizon of an evaporating black hole can be enabled by maximal entanglement
with a Hawking radiation system (in our case the second CFT) rather than
prevented by it. For initial states which are not finely-tuned to produce the
thermofield double state, the question of whether a late-time infalling
observer experiences a firewall translates to a question about the gravity dual
of a typical high-energy state of a two-CFT system.

rather special can happen near the horizon, already at the semiclassical level:
besides the standard Hawking outgoing modes, Alice can records a quasi-thermal
spectrum of ingoing modes, whose temperature and intensity diverges as Alice's
Killing energy $E$ goes to zero. I suggest that this effect can be thought of
in terms a ""horizon-infinity duality"", which relates the perception of
near-horizon and asymptotic geodesic observers -- the two faces of Hawking

combined with the more recent modular localization principle, has led to a
significant conceptual and computational extension of renormalized perturbation
theory to interactions involving fields of higher spin s>1/2. The starting
observation was that the well-known clash between point-localized gauge
theories and the Hilbert space, which hitherto has been solved by using a Krein
space setting, can also be solved by preserving the Hilbert space setting; in
this case the theory selects the tightest covariant localization which is
consistent with the Hilbert space positivity. The resulting semiinfinite
spacelike string-localization for all (m=0,s>1/2) representations does not only
lead to a new insight into the origin of infrared problems (including
confinement), but also improves the short-distance behavior of massive s>1/2
fields to the extend that the power-counting criterion admits candidates for
renormalizable interactions for arbitrary high spins. In this work the new
situation is exemplified for the interaction of massive vectormesons with
scalar charged- and neutral- (Higgs) matter, for which the new ""adiabatic
equivalence principle"" leads to a local relation between a renormalizable
stringlike and a nonrenormalizable (but nevertheless finite-parametric)
pointlike interaction.

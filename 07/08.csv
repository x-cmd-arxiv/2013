  Averaging",,,,,"math.OC cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers stochastic subgradient mirror-descent method for solving
constrained convex minimization problems. In particular, a stochastic
subgradient mirror-descent method with weighted iterate-averaging is
investigated and its per-iterate convergence rate is analyzed. The novel part
of the approach is in the choice of weights that are used to construct the
averages. Through the use of these weighted averages, we show that the known
optimal rates can be obtained with simpler algorithms than those currently
existing in the literature. Specifically, by suitably choosing the stepsize
values, one can obtain the rate of the order $1/k$ for strongly convex
functions, and the rate $1/\sqrt{k}$ for general convex functions (not
necessarily differentiable). Furthermore, for the latter case, it is shown that
a stochastic subgradient mirror-descent with iterate averaging converges (along
a subsequence) to an optimal solution, almost surely, even with the stepsize of
the form $1/\sqrt{1+k}$, which was not previously known. The stepsize choices
that achieve the best rates are those proposed by Paul Tseng for acceleration
of proximal gradient methods.

white dwarfs with masses 0.15-0.45 Msun, including the mass range for ELM white
dwarfs (<0.20Msun). The grid is appropriate for mass and age determination, and
to study their pulsational properties. White dwarf sequences have been computed
by performing full evolutionary calculations that consider the main energy
sources and processes of chemical abundance changes during white dwarf
evolution. Initial models for the evolving white dwarfs have been obtained by
computing the non-conservative evolution of a binary system consisting of a
Msun ZAMS star and a 1.4 Msun neutron star for various initial orbital periods.
To derive cooling ages and masses for He-core white dwarf we perform a least
square fitting of the M(Teff, g) and Age(Teff, g) relations provided by our
sequences by using a scheme that takes into account the time spent by models in
different regions of the Teff-g plane. This is useful when multiple solutions
for cooling age and mass determinations are possible in the case of
CNO-flashing sequences. We also explore the adiabatic pulsational properties of
models near the critical mass for the development of CNO flashes (~0.2 Msun).
This is motivated by the discovery of pulsating white dwarfs with stellar
masses near this threshold value. We obtain reliable and homogeneous mass and
cooling age determinations for 58 very low-mass white dwarfs, including 3
pulsating stars. Also, we find substantial differences in the period spacing
distributions of g-modes for models with stellar masses ~ 0.2 Msun, which could
be used as a seismic tool to distinguish stars that have undergone CNO flashes
in their early cooling phase from those that have not. Finally, for an easy
application of our results, we provide a reduced grid of values useful to
obtain masses and ages of He-core white dwarf.

illustrate its effectiveness. FILP takes an appreciable amount of time to
generate satisfactory solution in comparison to other heuristics. The
formulation thus serves as good benchmark for other heuristics. The
experimental study presented here focuses on producing a methodology that
generalizes well over spectrum of techniques that generates significant results
for one or more datasets. The performance of FILP model is finally compared to
the best results cited in literature for Carter benchmarks to assess its
potential. The problem can be further reduced by formulating with lesser number
of allocation variables it without affecting optimality of solution obtained.
FLIP model for ETP can also be adapted to solve other ETP as well as
combinatorial optimization problems.

sensitive to effects of vibrations and magnetic field curvature leading to a
longer experimental timescale. For both configurations of the atom
interferometer (AI), we show that a measurement of acceleration with a
statistical precision of 0.5% can be realized by analyzing the shape of the
echo envelope that has a temporal duration of a few microseconds. Using the
two-pulse AI, we obtain measurements of acceleration that are statistically
precise to 6 parts per million (ppm) on a 25 ms timescale. Using the
three-pulse AI, we obtain measurements of acceleration that are statistically

is achieved by analyzing the data across the echo envelope to improve the

reducing prominent systematic effects due to a magnetized vacuum chamber and
improving the signal-to-noise ratio. Simulations of both AI configurations with

discussed to construct the fuzzy regression model with non-uniform spreads to
deal with this problem. The first phase constructs the membership functions of
the least-squares estimates of regression coefficients based on extension

defuzzified by the centre of area method to obtain crisp regression

way to define a system in general relativity, and a new way to analyze the
problem of motion. An RQF is defined as a two-parameter family of timelike
worldlines comprising the boundary (topologically R x S^2) of the history of a
finite spatial volume, with the rigidity conditions that the congruence of
worldlines be expansion- and shear-free. In other words, the size and shape of
the system do not change. In previous work, such systems in Minkowski space
were shown to admit precisely the same six degrees of freedom of rigid body
motion that we are familiar with in Newtonian space-time, without any
constraints, circumventing a century-old theorem due to Herglotz and Noether.
This is a consequence of the fact that a two-sphere of any shape always admits
precisely six conformal Killing vector fields, which generate an action of the
Lorentz group on the sphere. Here we review the previous work in flat spacetime
and extend it in three directions: (1) Using a Fermi normal coordinates
approach, we explicitly construct, to the first few orders in powers of areal
radius, the general solution to the RQF rigidity equations in a generic curved
spacetime, and show that the resulting RQFs possess exactly the same six
motional degrees of freedom as in flat spacetime; (2) We discuss how RQFs
provide a natural context in which to understand the flow of energy, momentum
and angular momentum into and out of a system; in particular, we derive a
simple, exact expression for the flux of gravitational energy (a gravitational
analogue of the Poynting vector) in terms of operationally-defined geometrical
quantities on the boundary; (3) We use this new gravitational (or
""geometrical"") energy flux to resolve another apparent paradox, this one
involving electromagnetism in flat spacetime, which we discovered in the course

stack-up problem, namely the processing graph and the sequence graph. We show
that there is a processing of some list of sequences with at most p stack-up

across several scientific disciplines including ecology and conservation
biology. Unfortunately, most methods proposed to reduce the fluctuations in
chaotic systems are not applicable for real, biological populations. This is
because such methods typically require detailed knowledge of system specific
parameters and the ability to manipulate them in real time; conditions often
not met by most real populations. Moreover, real populations are often noisy
and extinction-prone, which can sometimes render such methods ineffective. Here
we investigate a control strategy, which works by perturbing the population
size, and is robust to reasonable amounts of noise and extinction probability.
This strategy, called the Adaptive Limiter Control (ALC), has been previously
shown to increase constancy and persistence of laboratory populations and
metapopulations of Drosophila melanogaster. Here we present a detailed
numerical investigation of the effects of ALC on the fluctuations and
persistence of metapopulations. We show that at high migration rates,
application of ALC does not require a priori information about the population
growth rates. We also show that ALC can stabilize metapopulations even when
applied to as low as one-tenth of the total number of subpopulations. Moreover,
ALC is effective even when the subpopulations have high extinction rates:
conditions under which one other control algorithm has previously failed to
attain stability. Importantly, ALC not only reduces the fluctuation in
metapopulation sizes, but also the global extinction probability. Finally, the
method is robust to moderate levels of noise in the dynamics and the carrying
capacity of the environment. These results, coupled with our earlier empirical
findings, establish ALC to be a strong candidate for stabilizing real

parametrized by its angle $\theta_1$, where $\theta_1=2\pi$ for flat space. We
find that the tensor components have singularities of the type $r^\gamma$, but
the generic leading $\gamma$ equals ${4\pi \over \theta_1} - 2$, which is

$\theta_1={2\pi\over N}$. Thus the functions are analytic in those cases that
can be solved by the method of images starting from flat space, and they are
not divergent in the cases that interpolate between those. As a wedge of angle
$\alpha$ can be solved by images starting from a cone of angle $2\alpha$, a
divergent stress can arise in a wedge with $\pi <\alpha \le 2\pi$ but not in a
smaller one.

along and transverse to the stream which can lead to the development of a
visible gap. For a stream narrow relative to its orbital radius the time of
stream crossing is sufficiently short that the impact approximation can be used
to derive the changes in angular momenta and radial actions along the star
stream. The epicyclic approximation is used to calculate the evolution of the
density of the stream as it orbits around in a galactic potential. Analytic
expressions are available for a point mass, however, the general expressions
are easily numerically evaluated for perturbing objects with arbitrary density
profiles. With a simple allowance for the velocity dispersion of the stream,
moderately warm streams can be modeled. The predicted evolution agrees well
with the outcome of simulations of stellar streams for streams with widths up
to 1% of the orbital radius of the stream. The angular momentum distribution
within the stream shears out gaps with time, further reducing their visibility,
although the size of the shear effect requires more detailed simulations. An
illustrative model indicates that shear will limit the persistent gaps to a
minimum length of a few times the stream width. In general the equations are
useful for dynamical insight into the development of stream gaps and their
measurement.

Helioseismic holography has been applied to samples taken from two populations

over 100 members, that were selected to minimize systematic bias, as described
in Paper I (Leka et al., 2012). Paper II (Birch et al., 2012) showed that there
are statistically significant signatures in the average helioseismic properties

detailed analysis of the samples of pre-emergence regions and regions without
emergence, based on discriminant analysis. The property that is best able to
distinguish the populations is found to be the surface magnetic field, even a
day before the emergence time. However, after accounting for the correlations
between the surface field and the quantities derived from helioseismology,
there is still evidence of a helioseismic precursor to active region emergence

constraints enforcing that no line of the system exceeds its thermal limit. We
develop off-line heuristics that reduce this non-convex optimization to a
succession of Linear Programs (LP) where at each step the constraints are
linearized analytically around the current operating point. The algorithm is
accelerated further with a version of the cutting plane method greatly reducing
the number of active constraints during the optimization, while checking
feasibility of the non-active constraints post-factum. This hybrid algorithm
solves a typical single-contingency problem over the MathPower Polish Grid

are always sparse, i.e., FACTS devices are placed on only a few lines. The
optimal FACTS are not always placed on the originally congested lines, however
typically the correction(s) is made at line(s) positioned in a relative

dipole anisotropy is expected due to our local motion with respect to the CMBR
rest frame. We analyse data with an improved fit to the number density, n(S),
as a function of the flux density S, which allows deviation from a pure power
law behaviour. We also impose more stringent cuts to remove the contribution
due to clustering dipole. In agreement with earlier results, we find that the
amplitude of anisotropy is significantly larger in comparison to the prediction
based on CMBR measurements. The extracted speed is found to be roughly 3 times
the speed corresponding to CMBR. The significance of deviation is smaller,
roughly 2 sigma, in comparison to earlier estimates. For the cut, S>30 mJy, the
speed is found to be $1110\pm370$ Km/s using the source count analysis. The
direction of the dipole anisotropy is found to be approximately in agreement
with CMBR. We find that the results are relatively insensitive to the lower as
well as upper limit imposed on the flux density. Our results suggest that the
Universe is intrinsically anisotropic with the axis of anisotropy axis pointing
roughly towards the CMBR dipole direction. Finally we present a method which
may allow an independent extraction of the local speed and an intrinsic dipole
anisotropy, provided a larger data set becomes available in future.

the test statistic is an average over MMDs computed on subsets of the samples.
The choice of block size allows control over the tradeoff between test power
and computation time. In this respect, the $B$-test family combines favorable
properties of previously proposed MMD two-sample tests: B-tests are more
powerful than a linear time test where blocks are just pairs of samples, yet
they are more computationally efficient than a quadratic time test where a
single large block incorporating all the samples is used to compute a
U-statistic. A further important advantage of the B-tests is their
asymptotically Normal null distribution: this is by contrast with the
U-statistic, which is degenerate under the null hypothesis, and for which
estimates of the null distribution are computationally demanding. Recent
results on kernel selection for hypothesis testing transfer seamlessly to the
B-tests, yielding a means to optimize test power via kernel choice.

relatively low bandwidth and high latency of the PCI-e bus are usually
bottleneck issues for co-processing. Recently, coupled CPU-GPU architectures
have received a lot of attention, e.g. AMD APUs with the CPU and the GPU
integrated into a single chip. That opens up new opportunities for optimizing
query co-processing. In this paper, we experimentally revisit hash joins, one
of the most important join algorithms for main memory databases, on a coupled
CPU-GPU architecture. Particularly, we study the fine-grained co-processing
mechanisms on hash joins with and without partitioning. The co-processing
outlines an interesting design space. We extend existing cost models to
automatically guide decisions on the design space. Our experimental results on
a recent AMD APU show that (1) the coupled architecture enables fine-grained
co-processing and cache reuses, which are inefficient on discrete CPU-GPU
architectures; (2) the cost model can automatically guide the design and tuning
knobs in the design space; (3) fine-grained co-processing achieves up to 53%,
35% and 28% performance improvement over CPU-only, GPU-only and conventional
CPU-GPU co-processing, respectively. We believe that the insights and
implications from this study are initial yet important for further research on

stringently constrained. The vector and axial-vector states should be heavy
enough (with masses above the TeV scale), the mass splitting between them is
highly preferred to be small and the Higgs-like scalar should have a WW

derived for general optimal (r, {\delta})a codes which helps illuminate some of

potentially lower computational complexity. Our findings substantially enriches

theoretical stellar atmosphere models to the observations is widely used in
deriving fundamental parameters of massive stars. When applied to binaries,
however, these models generally neglect the interaction effects present in
these systems Aims: The aim of this paper is to explore the uncertainties in
binary stellar parameters that are derived from single-star models Methods:
Synthetic spectra that include the tidal perturbations and irradiation effects
are computed for the binary system alpha Virginis (Spica) using our
recently-developed CoMBiSpeC model. The synthetic spectra are compared to
S/N~2000 observations and optimum values of Teff and log(g) are derived.
Results: The binary interactions have only a small effect on the strength of
the photospheric absorption lines in Spica (<2% for the primary and <4% for the
secondary). These differences are comparable to the uncertainties inherent to
the process of matching synthetic spectra to the observations and thus the
derived values of Teff and log(g) are unaffected by the binary perturbations.
On the other hand, the interactions do produce significant phase-dependent line
profile variations in the primary star, leading to systematic distortions in
the shape of its radial velocity curve. Migrating sub-features (""bumps"") are
predicted by our model to be present in the same photospheric lines as
observed, and their appearance does not require any a priori assumptions
regarding non-radial pulsation modes. Matching the strength of lines in which
the most prominent ""bumps"" occur requires synthetic spectra computed with
larger ""microturbulence"" than that required by other lines.

As a first part, we calculate a density profile of the adsorbed polymers by
developing an extension of the Bethe-Peierls approximation to the case of
nonhomogeneous systems. This approach relies on the combination of the single
chain adsorption theory and the lattice version of the self-consistent field
theory. Semi-flexibility of a chain is described by incorporating a finite
coordination number of the lattice into the consideration, in the spirit of the
previous Silberberg approach. The developed lattice theory incorporates the
interaction between nearest-neighbor pairs of segments and finite chain length.
The theory is completely mapped into the Scheutjens-Fleer theory in the limit
of infinite coordination number. As a second part of the developed approach, we
calculate the configurational entropy to investigate how the density structure
of the semi-flexible polymers near the surface relates to possible reduction of
glass transition temperature near nonabsorbing surface and enhancement near the
strongly attractive surface.

  We present high-sensitivity mm-wave observations of CO lines in 24 objects of

profiles show that the emissions very probably come from disks in rotation. We
derive typical values of the disk mass between 1e-3 and 1e-2 Mo, about two

high-detection rate (upper limits being in fact not very significant) clearly
confirm that the NIR excess of these stars arises from compact disks in

outflows are also found in about eight objects, with moderate expansion
velocities of ~ 10 km/s, to be compared with the velocities of about 100 km/s
often found in ""standard"" PPNe. Except for two sources with complex profiles,
the outflowing gas in our objects represents a minor nebular component. Our
simple estimates of the disk typical sizes yields values ~ 0.5 - 1 arcsec, i.e.
between 5e15 and 3e16 cm. Estimates of the linear momenta carried by the
outflows, which can only be performed in a few well studied objects, also yield
moderate values, compared with the linear momenta that can be released by the
stellar radiation pressure (contrary, again, to the case of the very massive
and fast bipolar outflows in ""standard"" PPNe, that are strongly overluminous).
The mass and dynamics of nebulae around various classes of post-AGB stars
differ very significantly, and we can expect the formation of PNe with very
different properties.

size $\sim1$ pc and total mass $\sim1000\, M_{\odot}$. The masses of individual
sink particles vary, but are typically $\sim100\, M_{\odot}$, consistent with
the Jeans mass when gas cools to the CMB temperature, though some solar mass
fragments are also produced. At the low metallicity of $10^{-4}\, Z_{\odot}$,
fragmentation is completely suppressed on scales greater than 0.01 pc and total
stellar mass is lower by a factor of 3 than in the higher metallicity
simulations. The sink particle accretion rates, and thus their masses, are
determined by the mass of the gravitationally unstable gas cloud and the
prolonged gas accretion over many Myr. The simulations thus exhibit features of
both monolithic collapse and competitive accretion. Even considering possible
dust induced fragmentation that would occur at higher densities, the formation
of a bona fide stellar cluster seems to require metal line cooling and
metallicities of at least $10^{-3}\, Z_{\odot}$.

antisymmetric tensor order parameter is studied by means of the field-theoretic
renormalization group (RG) in the leading order of the
$\varepsilon=4-d$-expansion (one-loop approximation). For $n=2$ and 3 the model
is equivalent to the scalar and the O(3)-symmetric vector models, for $n\ge4$
it involves two independent interaction terms and two coupling constants. It is
shown that for $n>4$ the RG equations have no infrared (IR) attractive fixed
points and their solutions (RG flows) leave the stability region of the model.
This means that fluctuations of the order parameter change the nature of the
phase transition from the second-order type (suggested by the mean-field
theory) to the first-order one. For $n=4$, the IR attractive fixed point exists
and the IR behaviour is non-universal: if the coupling constants belong to the
basin of attraction for the IR point, the phase transition is of the second
order and the IR critical scaling regime realizes. The corresponding critical
exponents $\nu$ and $\eta$ are presented in the order $\varepsilon$ and
$\varepsilon^{2}$, respectively. Otherwise the RG flows pass outside the

protocol that can easily be combined with any other greedy routing algorithm to

sparse and contains obstacles. The space necessary to store the additional
routing information at a node u is on average not larger than the size
necessary to store the IDs of the neighbors of u. The amount of work to setup
the complete data structure is on average proportional to flooding the entire

the performance of HBR in combination with two simple energy-aware geographic

correspondence: proofs, programs, strategies. But the universe of strategies
goes beyond intuitionistic logics and lambda calculus, to capture stateful
programs. In this paper we describe a logical counterpart to this extension, in
which proofs denote such strategies. The system is expressive: it contains all
of the connectives of Intuitionistic Linear Logic, and first-order
quantification. Use of Laird's sequoid operator allows proofs with imperative
behaviour to be expressed. Thus, we can embed first-order Intuitionistic Linear
Logic into this system, Polarized Linear Logic, and an imperative total
programming language.
  The proof system has a tight connection with a simple game model, where games
are forests of plays. Formulas are modelled as games, and proofs as
history-sensitive winning strategies. We provide a strong full completeness
result with respect to this model: each finitary strategy is the denotation of
a unique analytic (cut-free) proof. Infinite strategies correspond to analytic
proofs that are infinitely deep. Thus, we can normalise proofs, via the
semantics.

[Fe/H]=0 and M=1.5 Msun at [Fe/H]=-1.7, respectively, by adopting Main Sequence
rotation velocities in the range 0 - 120 km/s. At high metallicity, we find
that the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke instability, active at the interface between
the convective envelope and the rapid rotating core, contaminates the
13C-pocket (the major neutron source) with 14N (the major neutron poison), thus
reducing the neutron flux available for the synthesis of heavy elements. As a
consequence, the yields of heavy-s elements (Ba, La, Nd, Sm) and, to a less
extent, those of light-s elements (Sr, Y, Zr) decrease with increasing rotation
velocities up to 60 km/s. However, for larger initial rotation velocities, the
production of light-s and, to a less extent, that of heavy-s begins again to
increase, due to mixing induced by meridional circulations. At low metallicity,
the effects of meridional circulations are important even at rather low
rotation velocity. The combined effect of Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke instability
and meridional circulations determines an increase of light-s and, to a less
extent, heavy-s elements, while lead is strongly reduced. For both
metallicities, the rotation-induced instabilities active during the interpulse
phase reduce the neutrons-to-seeds ratio, so that the spectroscopic indexes
[hs/ls] and [Pb/hs] decrease by increasing the initial rotation velocity. Our
analysis suggests that rotation could explain the spread in the s-process
indexes, as observed in s-process enriched stars at different metallicities.

corresponding to a mass of about 0.15 Msun for an assumed cluster distance
modulus of (m-M)_0 = 6.30 mag (d ~ 182 pc), within a radius of 3.5{\deg} around

({\alpha}_centre = 8h 39m 37s, {\delta}_centre = 19{\deg} 35' 02""). We also
derive a total cluster mass of about 630 Msun and a 2D half-number and
half-mass radius of 4.25 pc and 3.90 pc respectively. The global mass function
(MF) of the cluster members shows evidence for a turnover around m = 0.65 Msun.
While more massive stars can be fit by a power-law {\xi}(m) ~ m^(-{\alpha})
with slope {\alpha} = 2.88 +/- 0.22, stars less massive than m = 0.65 Msun are
best fitted with {\alpha} = 0.85 +/- 0.10. In agreement with its large
dynamical age, we find that Praesepe is strongly mass segregated and that the
mass function slope for high mass stars steepens from a value of {\alpha} =
2.32 +/- 0.24 inside the half-mass radius to {\alpha} = 4.90 +/- 0.51 outside
the half-mass radius. We finally identify a significant population of binaries
and triples in the colour-magnitude diagram of Praesepe. Assuming non-random
pairing of the binary components, a binary fraction of about 35% for primaries
in the mass range 0.6 < m/Msun < 2.20 is required to explain the observed
number of binaries in the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD).

features caused by the divergence of long-range fluctuations of density and
nonuniversal (system-dependent) features associated with specific

Ising-model class of universality. The asymptotic power laws for the
thermodynamic properties are described by two independent universal critical
exponents and by two independent nonuniversal critical amplitudes; other
critical amplitudes can be obtained by universal relations. The nonuniversal

proofs of unsatisfiability as a powerful tool to extract information in order

a minimal reason that led to unsatisfiability, for computing abstractions, or
for deriving Craig interpolants. In this paper we focus on two important
aspects that concern efficient handling of proofs of unsatisfiability:
compression and manipulation. First of all, since the proof size can be very
large in general (exponential in the size of the input problem), it is indeed
beneficial to adopt techniques to compress it for further processing. Secondly,
proofs can be manipulated as a flexible preprocessing step in preparation for
interpolant computation. Both these techniques are implemented in a framework
that makes use of local rewriting rules to transform the proofs. We show that a
careful use of the rules, combined with existing algorithms, can result in an
effective simplification of the original proofs. We have evaluated several
heuristics on a wide range of unsatisfiable problems deriving from SAT and SMT
test cases.

optimal strategies in strategic form games. This periodicity solution concept
yields new insight into non-trivial games. In mixed strategy strategic form
games, periodic solutions yield values for the utility function of each player
that are equal to the Nash equilibrium ones. In contrast to the Nash
strategies, here the payoffs of each player are robust against what the
opponent plays. Sometimes, periodicity strategies yield higher utilities, and
sometimes the Nash strategies do, but often the utilities of these two
strategies coincide. We formally define and study periodic strategies in two
player perfect information strategic form games with pure strategies and we
prove that every non-trivial finite game has at least one periodic strategy,
with non-trivial meaning non-degenerate payoffs. In some classes of games where
mixed strategies are used, we identify quantitative features. Particularly
interesting are the implications for collective action games, since there the
collective action strategy can be incorporated in a purely non-cooperative
context. Moreover, we address the periodicity issue when the players have a
continuum set of strategies available.

weather- and climate- prediction models makes it necessary to use numerically
efficient and highly scalable algorithms to solve the equations of large scale
atmospheric fluid dynamics. For stability and efficiency reasons several of the
operational forecasting centres, in particular the Met Office and the ECMWF in
the UK, use semi-implicit semi-Lagrangian time stepping in the dynamical core
of the model. The additional burden with this approach is that a three
dimensional elliptic partial differential equation (PDE) for the pressure
correction has to be solved at every model time step and this often constitutes
a significant proportion of the time spent in the dynamical core. To run within
tight operational time scales the solver has to be parallelised and there seems
to be a (perceived) misconception that elliptic solvers do not scale to large
processor counts and hence implicit time stepping can not be used in very high
resolution global models. After reviewing several methods for solving the
elliptic PDE for the pressure correction and their application in atmospheric
models we demonstrate the performance and very good scalability of Krylov
subspace solvers and multigrid algorithms for a representative model equation
with more than $10^{10}$ unknowns on 65536 cores on HECToR, the UK's national
supercomputer. For this we tested and optimised solvers from two existing
numerical libraries (DUNE and hypre) and implemented both a Conjugate Gradient
solver and a geometric multigrid algorithm based on a tensor-product approach
which exploits the strong vertical anisotropy of the discretised equation. We
study both weak and strong scalability and compare the absolute solution times
for all methods; in contrast to one-level methods the multigrid solver is
robust with respect to parameter variations.

to produce the synchrotron self-Compton emission. The other is the variable
component from the inner region, in which the electrons are accelerated by the
stochastic acceleration process. We use the time-dependent SSC model to produce
the emission from the variable component. We suggest that the flares are due to
the hardening of the electron spectrum under the process of the stochastic
acceleration, which leads to the hardening of the observed spectrum in the

of some of the substructural extensions of that logic. To do this, we perform
an algebraic analysis of the Gentzen systems defined by the substructural
calculi $\FL_\sigma$. Such systems are extensions of the full Lambek calculus
$\FL$ with the rules codified by a subsequence, $\sigma$, of the sequence $e
w_l w_r c$; where $e$ stands for \emph{exchange}, $w_l$ for \emph{left
weakening}, $w_r$ for \emph{right weakening}, and $c$ for \emph{contraction}.
We prove that these Gentzen systems (in languages without implications) are
algebraizable by obtaining their equivalent algebraic semantics. All these
classes of algebras are varieties of pointed semilatticed monoids and they can
be embedded in their ideal completions. As a consequence of these results, we
reveal that the fragments of the Gentzen systems associated with the calculi
$\FL_\sigma$ are the restrictions of them to the sublanguages considered, and
we also reveal that in these languages, the fragments of the external systems
associated with $\FL[\sigma]$ are the external systems associated with the
restricted Gentzen systems (i.e., those obtained by restriction of
$\FL_\sigma]$ to the implication-less languages considered). We show that all
these external systems without implication have algebraic semantics but they
are not algebraizable (and are not even protoalgebraic). Results concerning
fragments without implication of intuitionistic logic without contraction were
already reported in Bou et al.(2006): On two fragments with negation and
without implication of the logic of residuated lattices. Archive for
Mathematical Logic 45(5) and in Adill\'on et al. (2007): On three
implication-less fragments of t-norm based fuzzy logics. Fuzzy Sets and Systems

RV's and the stock prices are modeled using a biased random walk, for which the

importantly, the number of records in the stocks appears to be systematically
decreased in comparison with the random walk model. Considering the
autoregressive AR(1) process, we can predict the record statistics of the daily
stock prices more accurately. We also compare the stock data with simulations
of the record statistics of the more complicated GARCH(1,1) model, which, in

for a player, if her payoff is maximal. A tempting approach to solving this
problem is to seek optimal Nash equilibria, the standard form of equilibria
where no player has an incentive to deviate from her strategy. We argue that a
player with the power to define an equilibrium is in a position, where she
should not be interested in the symmetry of a Nash equilibrium, and ignore the
question of whether or not her outcome can be improved if the other strategies
are fixed. That is, she would only have to make sure that the other players

may have better (and cannot have worse) optimal equilibria for the designated
powerful player. We apply this strategy to concurrent bimatrix games and to
turn based multi-player mean-payoff games. For the latter, we show that such
political equilibria as well as Nash equilibria always exist, and provide
simple examples where the political equilibrium is superior. We show that
constructing political and Nash equilibria are NP-complete problems. We also
show that, for a fixed number of players, the hardest part is to solve the

decades, but has no unambiguous astro-physical context. We construct the
largest sample to date of 58 high redshift quasars (z > 0.45) selected from the
XMM-Newton archive based on a high photon count criterion (> 1800). We measure
the optical depth tau at 0.5 keV, and find that 43% of the quasars show
significant absorption. We aim to find which physical parameters of the quasars
drive their observed absorption, e.g., redshift, radio luminosity, radio
loudness, or the X-ray luminosity. We compare the absorption behavior with
redshift with the pattern expected if the diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM) is
responsible for the observed absorption, and with a comparison sample of gamma
ray burst (GRB) X-ray afterglows. Although the z > 2 quasar opacity is
consistent with diffuse IGM absorption, many intermediate z (0.45 < z < 2)
quasars are not sufficiently absorbed for this scenario, and are appreciably
less absorbed than GRBs. Only 10/37 quasars at z < 2 are absorbed, and only
5/30 radio quiet quasars are absorbed. We find a weak correlation between tau
and z, and even a weaker correlation between tau and radio luminosity, which
leads to the conclusion that although a diffuse IGM origin for the quasar
absorption is unlikely, optical depth does seem to increase with redshift,
roughly as (1+z)^{2.2+-0.6}, tending at high-z to tau ~ 0.4, similar to the
high-z GRB values. This result can be explained by an ionized and clumpy IGM at
z < 2, and a cold, diffuse IGM at higher redshift. If, conversely, ascribed to
local absorption at the quasar, and owing to the steep L_x ~ (1+z)^{7.1+-0.5}
correlation in the present sample, the host column density scales as N_H ~
L_x^{0.7+-0.1}.

simulate output-prefixing, as shown by Honda and Tokoro (1991) and by Boudol
(1992), and input-guarded choice, as shown by Nestmann and Pierce (2000). A
natural question arises, then, whether or not it is as expressive as the full
pi-calculus. We show that this is not the case. More precisely, we show that
there does not exist any uniform, fully distributed translation from the
pi-calculus into the asynchronous pi-calculus, up to any ""reasonable"" notion of
equivalence. This result is based on the incapability of the asynchronous
pi-calculus to break certain symmetries possibly present in the initial
communication graph. By similar arguments, we prove a separation result between
the pi-calculus and CCS, and between the pi-calculus and the pi-calculus with
internal mobility, a subset of the pi-calculus proposed by Sangiorgi where the
output actions can only transmit private names.

  An experimental investigation",,,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.GT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  In this communication, a simple mechanism in the optional public goods game
is experimentally investigated using two experimental settings; and first time,
the cyclic strategy pattern in full state space is demonstrated by means of
velocity. It is, furthermore, elaborated that the strategies of cooperation,
defection and nonparticipant form a Rock-Paper-Scissors type cycle, and the
cycle of three strategies are persistent over 200 rounds. This cycle is very
similar to the cycle given by evolutionary dynamics e.g. replicator dynamics.
The mechanism that nonparticipant can sustain cooperation is driven by the
Rock-Paper-Scissors type of cyclic dominance in the three strategies. That is,
if the cycle is existent, the cooperation will always sustain. Meanwhile, the
distribution of social states changes in the state space and from cooperation
as the most frequent strategy to defection and, from defection to
nonparticipant, forms a clear rotation path in a long run. These results seem
to implicate that the evolutionary dynamics has ability to capture the real
dynamics applying not only on biosphere, but also on human society.

the mid-infrared, we utilize the MID-infrared interferometric Instrument (MIDI)
at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) that is sensitive to

extensive amount of new interferometric observations from the MIDI AGN Large

the existing MIDI observations of AGNs. Additionally, we have obtained
high-quality mid-infrared spectra from VLT/VISIR. We present correlated and
total flux spectra for 23 AGNs and derive flux and size estimates at 12 micron

result is the relatively high level of unresolved flux and its large scatter:
The median ""point source fraction"" is 70 % for type 1 and 47 % for type 2 AGNs

about 5 mas (0.1 - 10 pc). Among sources observed with similar spatial
resolution, it varies from 20 % - 100 %. For 18 of the sources, two nuclear
components can be distinguished in the radial fits. While these models provide
good fits to all but the brightest sources, significant elongations are
detected in eight sources. The half-light radii of the fainter sources are
smaller than expected from the size ~ L^0.5 scaling of the bright sources and
show a large scatter, especially when compared to the relatively tight

oversaturated colloid-rich (liquid) phase in contact with an undersaturated
colloid-poor (vapor) phase of a colloidal dispersion is investigated
theoretically during the early-stage relaxation, where the interface is
relaxing towards a local equilibrium state while the bulk phases are still out
of equilibrium. Since systems of this type exhibit a clear separation of
colloidal and solvent relaxation time scales with typical times of interfacial
tension measurements in between, they can be expected to be suitable for
analogous experimental studies, too. The major finding is that, irrespective of
how much the bulk phases differ from two-phase coexistence, the interfacial
structure and the interfacial tension approach those at two-phase coexistence
during the early-stage relaxation process. This is a surprising observation
since it implies that the relaxation towards global equilibrium of the
interface is not following but preceding that of the bulk phases. Scaling forms
for the local chemical potential, the flux, and the dissipation rate exhibit
qualitatively different leading order contributions depending on whether an
equilibrium or a non-equilibrium system is considered. The degree of
non-equilibrium between the bulk phases is found to not influence the
qualitative relaxation behavior (i.e., the values of power-law exponents), but
to determine the quantitative deviation of the observed quantities from their
values at two-phase coexistence. Whereas the underlying dynamics differs
between colloidal and molecular fluids, the behavior of quantities such as the
interfacial tension approaching the equilibrium values during the early-stage
relaxation process, during which non-equilibrium conditions of the bulk phases
are not changed, can be expected to occur for both types of systems.

African, Indo-China, and Pacific regions. Extreme fluxes appeared often in the
early morning and persisted for several hours during the maximum and recovery
phase of geomagnetic storms. We analyzed nine storm-time events when extreme
electron fluxes first appeared in the Eastern Hemisphere, then drifted further
eastward toward the South-Atlantic Anomaly. Using the electron spectra, we
estimated the possible ionization effect produced by quasi-trapped electrons in
the topside ionosphere. The estimated ionization was found to be large enough
to satisfy observed storm-time increases in the ionospheric total electron
content determined for the same spatial and temporal ranges from global
ionospheric maps. Additionally, extreme fluxes of quasi-trapped electrons were
accompanied by the significant elevation of the low-latitude F-layer obtained
from COSMIC/FORMOSAT-3 radio occultation measurements. We suggest that the
storm-time ExB drift of energetic electrons from the inner radiation belt is an
important driver of positive ionospheric storms within low-latitude and

wavelength range 1.087-1.687 micron, with resolving power R=130. We obtain the
transmission spectrum from 0.53-1.687 microns with S/N levels between 3000 and
11,000 in 0.1 micron bins. WASP-19 is a very active star, with optical stellar
flux varying by a few per cent over time. We correct the transit light curves
for the effects of stellar activity using ground-based activity monitoring with
the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO). While we were not able to
construct a transmission spectrum using the blue optical data due to the
presence of large occulted star spots, we were able to use the spot crossings
to help constrain the mean stellar spot temperature. To search for predicted
features in the hot-Jupiter atmosphere, we also define spectral indices for
differential radius measurements to specifically search for the presence of TiO
and alkali line features. Our measurements rule out TiO features predicted for
a planet of WASP-19b's equilibrium temperature (2050 K) in the transmission
spectrum at the 2.7-2.9 sigma confidence level, depending on atmospheric model
formalism. The WFC3 transmission spectrum shows strong absorption features due
to the presence of H2O, which is detected at the 4 sigma confidence level
between 1.1 and 1.4 microns. The results indicate that WASP-19b is a planet
with no or low levels of TiO and without a high C/O ratio. The lack of
observable TiO features are possibly due to rainout, breakdown from stellar
activity or the presence of other absorbers in the optical.

of life and the economic and social well-being of developing countries. The
arsenal of measures against such epidemics is well-established, but costly and
insufficient to mitigate their impact. In this paper, we argue that mobile
technology adds a powerful weapon to this arsenal, because (a) mobile devices
endow us with the unprecedented ability to measure and model the detailed
behavioral patterns of the affected population, and (b) they enable the
delivery of personalized behavioral recommendations to individuals in real
time. We combine these two ideas and propose several strategies to generate
such recommendations from mobility patterns. The goal of each strategy is a
large reduction in infections, with a small impact on the normal course of
daily life. We evaluate these strategies over the Orange D4D dataset and show
the benefit of mobile micro-measures, even if only a fraction of the population
participates. These preliminary results demonstrate the potential of mobile
technology to complement other measures like vaccination and quarantines
against disease epidemics.

whether tidal interaction or the ongoing or past star-formation is a dominant

  Previously, HI morphological criteria were identified for ongoing
spiral-spiral interactions. When we apply these to the Irregular dwarf
population, they either select almost all or none of the population. We find
that only the Asymmetry-based criteria can be used to identify very isolated
dwarfs (i.e., these have a low tidal indication). Otherwise, there is little or
no relation between the level of tidal interaction and the HI morphology. We
compare the HI morphology to three star-formation rates based on either Halpha,
FUV or the resolved stellar population, probing different star-formation
time-scales.
  The HI morphology parameters that trace the inequality of the distribution,
the Gini, GM, and M20 parameters, correlate weakly with all these
star-formation rates. This is in line with the picture that local physics
dominates the ISM appearance and not tidal effects. Finally, we compare the
SDSS measures of star-formation and stellar mass to the HI morphological
parameters for all four HI surveys. In the two lower-resolution HI surveys
(12""), there is no relation between star-formation measures and HI morphology.
The morphology of the two high-resolution HI surveys (6""), the Asymmetry,
Smoothness, Gini, M20, and GM, do show a link to the total star-formation, but
a weak one.

with stellar evolution; for example the age or distance can be more accurately
determined than for field stars. However, one important parameter, the
metallicity, is only known for a marginal percentage of open clusters. We aim
at a consistent set of parameters for the open clusters investigated in our
photometric Delta-a survey of chemically peculiar stars. Special attention is
paid to expanding our knowledge of cluster metallicities and verifying their
scale. Making use of a previously developed method based on normalised
evolutionary grids and photometric data, the distance, age, reddening, and
metallicity of open clusters were derived. To transform photometric
measurements into effective temperatures to use as input for our method, a set
of temperature calibrations for the most commonly used colour indices and
photometric systems was compiled. We analysed 58 open clusters in total. Our
derived metallicity values were in excellent agreement with about 30
spectroscopically studied targets. The mean value of the absolute deviations
was found to be 0.03 dex, with no noticeable offset or gradient. The method was
also applied using recent evolutionary models based on the currently accepted
lower solar abundance value Z=0.014. No significant differences were found
compared to grids using the former adopted solar value Z=0.02. Furthermore,
some divergent photometric datasets were identified and discussed. The method
provides an accurate way of obtaining properly scaled metallicity values for
open clusters. In light of present and future homogeneous photometric sky
surveys, the sample of stellar clusters can be extended to the outskirts of the
Milky Way, where spectroscopic studies are almost impossible. This will help
for determining galactic metallicity gradients in more detail.

Willy Hartner and Dirk Couprie, remain unchallenged. This paper presents some
important objections to these two possibilities, based on the fact that these

addition, any explanation based on cycles will need to face the complex problem
of visibility (smallest observable eclipse, weather...). The present article
also includes a statistical study on the predictability of solar eclipses for a
variety of periods, similar to that performed by Willy Hartner for lunar
eclipses, resulting in lower probabilities in the solar case (and percentages
depend on the chosen magnitude limit). The conclusion is that none of the
cycles proposed so far provides a satisfactory explanation of the prediction,
and, on statistical grounds, none of the periods studied leads to a significant
probability of success with solar eclipse cycles.

reproduce the white-light flare emission. The main results from the continuum
analysis are the following: 1) the detection of Balmer continuum (in emission)
that is present during all flares and with a wide range of relative
contributions to the continuum flux at bluer wavelengths than the Balmer jump;
2) a blue continuum at flare maximum that is linearly decreasing with
wavelength from \lambda = 4000-4800\AA, matched by the spectral shape of hot,
blackbody emission with typical temperatures of T_{BB}~9000-14,000 K; 3) a
redder continuum apparent at wavelengths longer than H\beta\ (\lambda >

  cold mode accretion streams","9 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, significantly improved version",,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent observations have shown that the majority of the Andromeda galaxy's
satellites are aligned in a thin plane. On the theoretical side it has been
proposed that galaxies acquire their gas via cold streams. In addition,
numerical simulations show that the same streams also deliver gas clumps which
could potentially develop into satellite galaxies. Assuming that cold streams
are a major source of satellite systems around galaxies we calculate the
probabilities in two different models to find a certain fraction of satellites
within a thin plane around the central galaxy of the host halo with and without
having the same sense of rotation. Using simple geometrical considerations and
adopting a random orientation of the streams we demonstrate that the vast thin
disk of satellites detected around Andromeda can naturally be explained within
this framework. In fact, without any satellite scattering, two streams would
lead to too many satellites in the thin plane, compared with the observations.
Three streams reproduce the observations very well. Natural implications from

diseases to that of financial crises. Whenever the whole structure of a network
is unknown, one must resort to reconstruction methods that identify the least
biased ensemble of networks consistent with the partial information available.
A challenging case, frequently encountered due to privacy issues in the
analysis of interbank flows and Big Data, is when there is only local
(node-specific) aggregate information available. For binary networks, the
relevant ensemble is one where the degree (number of links) of each node is
constrained to its observed value. However, for weighted networks the problem
is much more complicated. While the naive approach prescribes to constrain the
strengths (total link weights) of all nodes, recent counter-intuitive results
suggest that in weighted networks the degrees are often more informative than
the strengths. This implies that the reconstruction of weighted networks would
be significantly enhanced by the specification of both strengths and degrees, a
computationally hard and bias-prone procedure. Here we solve this problem by
introducing an analytical and unbiased maximum-entropy method that works in the
shortest possible time and does not require the explicit generation of
reconstructed samples. We consider several real-world examples and show that,
while the strengths alone give poor results, the additional knowledge of the
degrees yields accurately reconstructed networks. Information-theoretic
criteria rigorously confirm that the degree sequence, as soon as it is
non-trivial, is irreducible to the strength sequence. Our results have strong
implications for the analysis of motifs and communities and whenever the
reconstructed ensemble is required as a null model to detect higher-order
patterns.

multiple-input multiple-output channel by decoding integer-linear combinations
of the transmitted streams, rather then the streams themselves. Previous works
have shown that the additional degree of freedom in choosing the integer
coefficients enables this receiver to approach the performance of
maximum-likelihood decoding in various scenarios. Nonetheless, even for the
optimal choice of integer coefficients, the additive noise at the equalizer's
output is still correlated. In this work we study a variant of integer-forcing,
termed successive integer-forcing, that exploits these noise correlations to
improve performance. This scheme is the integer-forcing counterpart of
successive interference cancellation for traditional linear receivers.
Similarly to the latter, we show that successive integer-forcing is capacity
achieving when it is possible to optimize the rate allocation to the different
streams. In comparison to standard successive interference cancellation
receivers, the successive integer-forcing receiver offers more possibilities
for capacity achieving rate tuples, and in particular, ones that are more
balanced.

distinguish such objects from Kerr black holes. In particular, their iron line
cannot have the characteristic low-energy tail of the line generated from

equilibrium. The boundaries of the mixed phase and the related critical points

Replica-Exchange (convective-RE) has been presented as an alternative to the
standard even-odd transition scheme. Computations on systems of various
complexity have shown that convective-RE may increase the number of replica
round-trips in temperature space with respect to the standard exchange scheme,
leading to a more effective sampling of energy basins. Moreover, it has been
shown that the method may prevent the formation of bottlenecks in the diffusive
walk of replicas through the space of temperature states. By using an ideal
temperature-RE model and a classical harmonic-oscillator RE scheme, we study
the performances of convective-RE when ergodicity is not broken and convergence
of acceptance probabilities is attained. In this dynamic regime, the round-trip
ratio between convective and standard-RE is at maximum ~1.5, a value much
smaller than that observed in non-ergodic simulations. For large acceptance
probabilities, the standard-RE outperforms convective-RE. Our observations
suggest that convective-RE can safely be used in either ergodic or non ergodic
regimes; however, convective-RE is advantageous only when bottlenecks occur in
the state-space diffusion of replicas, or when acceptance probabilities are
globally low. We also show that decoupling of the state-space dynamics of the
stick replica from the dynamics of the remaining replicas improves the
efficiency of convective-RE at low acceptance probability regimes.

multiscale method for an incompressible immiscible two-phase flow system with
degenerate permeabilities. The method is in a general formulation which
includes oversampling. We do not specify the discretization of the derived
macroscopic equation, but we give two examples of possible realizations,
suggesting a finite element solver for the fine scale and a vertex centered
finite volume method for the effective coarse scale equations. Assuming
periodicity, we show that the method is equivalent to a discretization of the
homogenized equation. We provide an a-posteriori estimate for the error between
the homogenized solutions of the pressure and saturation equations and the
corresponding HMM approximations. The error estimate is based on the results
recently achieved in [C. Canc{\`e}s, I. S. Pop, and M. Vohral\'{\i}k. An a

Grating-based differential phase contrast imaging techniques are compatible
with compact x-ray sources, which is a key requirement for the majority of
clinical x-ray modalities. However, these methods are substantially limited by
the need for mechanical phase stepping. We describe an electromagnetic phase
stepping method that eliminates mechanical motion, and thus removing the
constraints in speed, accuracy and flexibility. The method is broadly
applicable to both projection and tomography imaging modes. The transition from
mechanical to electromagnetic scanning should greatly facilitate the
translation of x-ray phase contrast techniques into mainstream applications.

fully implicit coupling of the Navier-Stokes and Cahn-Hilliard equation. In the
common case that the equations for interface and flow are coupled explicitly,
we find a time step restriction which is very different to other two-phase flow
models and in particular is independent of the grid size. We also show that the
proposed stabilization techniques can lift this time step restriction. Even
more pronounced is the performance of the proposed fully implicit scheme which
is stable for arbitrarily large time steps. We demonstrate in a Taylor flow
application that this superior coupling between flow and interface equation can
render diffuse interface models even computationally cheaper and faster than

  networks: analysis of different connectivity matrices and failure of the

neurons, for several kinds of recurrent connectivity matrices. This analysis is
performed by means of a perturbative expansion of the neural equations, where
the perturbative parameters are the intensities of the sources of randomness in
the system. In detail, these parameters are the variances of the background or
input noise, of the initial conditions and of the distribution of the synaptic
weights. The technique developed in this article can be used to study systems
which are invariant under the exchange of the neural indices and it allows us
to quantify the correlation structure of the network, in terms of pairwise and
higher order correlations between the neurons. We also determine the relation
between the correlation and the external input of the network, showing that
strong signals coming from the environment reduce significantly the amount of
correlation between the neurons. Moreover we prove that in general the
phenomenon of propagation of chaos does not occur, even in the thermodynamic
limit, due to the correlation structure of the 3 sources of randomness
considered in the model. Furthermore, we show that the propagation of chaos
does not depend only on the number of neurons in the network, but also and
mainly on the number of incoming connections per neuron. To conclude, we prove
that for special values of the parameters of the system the neurons become
perfectly correlated, a phenomenon that we have called stochastic
synchronization. These discoveries clearly prevent the use of the mean-field
theory in the description of the neural network.

optics, electromagnetics, acoustics, thermodynamics, etc. However, the most of
them have only been experimentally achieved by virtue of simplified approaches
due to their inhomogeneous and extreme parameters imposed by
transformation-optic method, and usually require challenging realization with
metamaterials. In this paper, we demonstrate an advanced bilayer thermal cloak
with naturally available materials first time. This scheme, directly from
thermal conduction equation, has been validated as an exact cloak rather than a
reduced one, and we experimentally confirmed its perfect performance
(heat-front maintenance and heat protection) in an actual setup. The proposed
scheme may open a new avenue to control the diffusive heat flow in ways
inconceivable with phonons.

token carries a real-valued clock. Transition arcs are labeled with time
intervals, which specify constraints on the ages of tokens. Furthermore, our
cost model assigns token storage costs per time unit to places, and firing
costs to transitions. This general model strictly subsumes both priced timed
automata and unbounded priced Petri nets. We study the cost of computations
that reach a given control-state. In general, a computation with minimal cost
may not exist, due to strict inequalities in the time constraints. However, we
show that the infimum of the costs to reach a given control-state is computable
in the case where all place and transition costs are non-negative. On the other
hand, if negative costs are allowed, then the question whether a given
control-state is reachable with zero overall cost becomes undecidable. In fact,
this negative result holds even in the simpler case of discrete time (i.e.,
integer-valued clocks).

  Foundations","89 pages, 140 figures (many include 3D PRC vector graphics)",,,,"math.MG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper is to serve as a key to the projective (homogeneous) model
developed by Charles Gunn (arXiv:1101.4542 [math.MG]). The goal is to explain
the underlying concepts in a simple language and give plenty of examples. It is
targeted to physicists and engineers and the emphasis is on explanation rather
than rigorous proof. The projective model is based on projective geometry and
Clifford algebra. It supplements and enhances vector and matrix algebras. It
also subsumes complex numbers and quaternions. Projective geometry augmented
with Clifford algebra provides a unified algebraic framework for describing
points, lines, planes, etc, and their transformations, such as rotations,
reflections, projections, and translations. The model is relevant not only to
Euclidean space but to a variety of homogeneous metric spaces.

certain properties over the network, but others question the methodology of
these experiments by proposing that the measured effects may be due to
homophily or a shared environment. In this paper we justify the existence of
the social influence by considering the temporal behavior of Last.fm users. In
order to clearly distinguish between friends sharing the same interest,
especially since Last.fm recommends friends based on similarity of taste, we
separated the timeless effect of similar taste from the temporal impulses of
immediately listening to the same artist after a friend. We measured strong
increase of listening to a completely new artist in a few hours period after a
friend compared to non-friends representing a simple trend or external
influence. In our experiment to eliminate network independent elements of
taste, we improved collaborative filtering and trend based methods by blending
with simple time aware recommendations based on the influence of friends. Our
experiments are carried over the two-year ""scrobble"" history of 70,000 Last.fm
users.

provide a novel means of extracting information about the MBH; an EMRB from the

in the context of radial-velocity exoplanet searches. The first is the
bi-Gaussian cross-correlation function fitting, and the second is the
measurement of asymmetry in radial-velocity spectral line information content,
Vasy.
  Methods. We make a systematic analysis of the most used common line profile
diagnosis, Bisector Inverse Slope and Velocity Span, along with the two
proposed ones. We evaluate all these diagnosis methods following a set of
well-defined common criteria and using both simulated and real data. We apply
them to simulated cross-correlation functions created with the program SOAP and
which are affected by the presence of stellar spots, and to real
cross-correlation functions, calculated from HARPS spectra, for stars with a
signal originating both in activity and created by a planet.
  Results. We demonstrate that the bi-Gaussian method allows a more precise
characterization of the deformation of line profiles than the standard bisector
inverse slope. The calculation of the deformation indicator is simpler and its
interpretation more straightforward. More importantly, its amplitude can be up
to 30% larger than that of the bisector span, allowing the detection of
smaller-amplitude correlations with radial-velocity variations. However, a
particular parametrization of the bisector inverse slope is shown to be more
efficient on high-signal-to-noise data than both the standard bisector and the
bi-Gaussian. The results of the Vasy method show that this indicator is more
effective than any of the previous ones, being correlated with the
radial-velocity with more significance for signals resulting from a line
deformation. Moreover, it provides a qualitative advantage over the bisector,
showing significant correlations with RV for active stars for which bisector
analysis is inconclusive. (abridged)

in a school. The most recent indications of such benefits are a lower tail (or
fin) beat at the back of a school and reduced oxygen consumption in schooling
fish versus solitary ones. How such advantages may arise is poorly understood.
Current hydrodynamic theories concern either fish swimming side by side or in a
diamond configuration and they largely ignore effects of viscosity and
interactions among wakes and individuals. In reality, however, hydrodynamic
effects are complex and fish swim in many configurations. Since these
hydrodynamic effects are difficult to study empirically, we investigate them in
a computer model by incorporating viscosity and interactions among wakes and
with individuals. We compare swimming efficiency of mullets of 12.6 cm
travelling solitarily and in schools of four different configurations at
several inter-individual distances. The resulting Reynolds number (based on
fish length) is approximately 1150. We show that these fish always swim more
efficiently in a school than alone (except in a dense phalanx). We indicate how
this efficiency may emerge from several kinds of interactions among wakes and
individuals. Since individuals in our simulations are not even intending to
exploit the wake, gains in efficiency are obtained more easily than previously
thought.

gradients of the flow variables caused by strong shock waves and thick boundary
or shear layers. The resolution of those gradients imposes the use of extremely
small cells in the respective regions. Taking turbulence into account
intensives the variation in scales even more. Furthermore, hypersonic flows
have been shown to be extremely grid sensitive. For the simulation of
three-dimensional configurations of engineering applications, this results in a
huge amount of cells and prohibitive computational time. Therefore, modern
adaptive techniques can provide a gain with respect to computational costs and
accuracy, allowing the generation of locally highly resolved flow regions where
they are needed and retaining an otherwise smooth distribution. An h-adaptive
technique based on wavelets is employed for the solution of hypersonic flows.
The compressible Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations are solved using a
differential Reynolds stress turbulence model, well suited to predict
shock-wave-boundary-layer interactions in high enthalpy flows. Two test cases
are considered: a compression corner and a scramjet intake. The compression
corner is a classical test case in hypersonic flow investigations because it
poses a shock-wave-turbulent-boundary-layer interaction problem. The adaptive
procedure is applied to a two-dimensional confguration as validation. The
scramjet intake is firstly computed in two dimensions. Subsequently a
three-dimensional geometry is considered. Both test cases are validated with
experimental data and compared to non-adaptive computations. The results show
that the use of an adaptive technique for hypersonic turbulent flows at high
enthalpy conditions can strongly improve the performance in terms of memory and
CPU time while at the same time maintaining the required accuracy of the
results.

reasons - duplicate, off-topic, subjective, not a real question and too

3.4 Million questions. We first analyze and characterize the complete set of
0.1 Million 'closed' questions. Next, we use a machine learning framework and
build a predictive model to identify a 'closed' question at the time of
question creation.
  One of our key findings is that despite being marked as 'closed', subjective
questions contain high information value and are very popular with the users.
We observe an increasing trend in the percentage of closed questions over time
and find that this increase is positively correlated to the number of newly
registered users. In addition, we also see a decrease in community
participation to mark a 'closed' question which has led to an increase in
moderation job time. We also find that questions closed with the Duplicate and

the clusterization of water molecules, which strongly increases when

improve the performance of cross-population hybrids. The United States
Department of Agriculture - Agricultural Research Service reciprocal recurrent
selection experiment between the Iowa Stiff Stalk Synthetic (BSSS) and the Iowa
Corn Borer Synthetic No. 1 (BSCB1) populations represents one of the longest
standing models of selection for hybrid performance. To investigate the genomic
impact of this selection program, we used the Illumina MaizeSNP50 high-density
SNP array to determine genotypes of progenitor lines and over 600 individuals
across multiple cycles of selection. Consistent with previous research (Messmer
et al., 1991; Labate et al., 1997; Hagdorn et al., 2003; Hinze et al., 2005),
we found that genetic diversity within each population steadily decreases, with
a corresponding increase in population structure. High marker density also
enabled the first view of haplotype ancestry, fixation and recombination within
this historic maize experiment. Extensive regions of haplotype fixation within
each population are visible in the pericentromeric regions, where large blocks
trace back to single founder inbreds. Simulation attributes most of the
observed reduction in genetic diversity to genetic drift. Signatures of
selection were difficult to observe in the background of this strong genetic
drift, but heterozygosity in each population has fallen more than expected.
Regions of haplotype fixation represent the most likely targets of selection,
but as observed in other germplasm selected for hybrid performance (Feng et
al., 2006), there is no overlap between the most likely targets of selection in
the two populations. We discuss how this pattern is likely to occur during
selection for hybrid performance, and how it poses challenges for dissecting

The radial and angular dependence of gravitational and electromagnetic

paper we circumvent this problem by studying scalar, electromagnetic and
gravitational perturbations of Kerr-Newman black holes in the slow-rotation

self-consistent stability analysis of the Kerr-Newman metric, and in principle
it can be extended to any order in the small rotation parameter. We find
numerical evidence that the axial and polar sectors are isospectral at first
order in the spin, and speculate on the possible implications of this result.

detection and its influence on data forwarding in Mobile Social Networks (MSNs)
by taking the hybrid underlying networks with infrastructure support into
consideration. The hybrid underlying network is composed of large numbers of
mobile users and a small portion of Access Points (APs). Because APs can
facilitate the communication among long-distance nodes, the concept of physical
proximity community can be extended to be one across the geographical space. In
this work, we first investigate a space-crossing community detection method for
MSNs. Based on the detection results, we design a novel data forwarding
algorithm SAAS (Social Attraction and AP Spreading), and show how to exploit
the space-crossing communities to improve the data forwarding efficiency. We
evaluate our SAAS algorithm on real-life data from MIT Reality Mining and UIM.
Results show that space-crossing community plays a positive role in data
forwarding in MSNs in terms of deliver ratio and delay. Based on this new type
of community, SAAS achieves a better performance than existing social
community-based data forwarding algorithms in practice, including Bubble Rap
and Nguyen's Routing algorithms.

  Importantly, we show that correlation interactions between the ionized

accumulated a large number of light curves that span several years. Aims: The
search for transiting planets in these long time series is computationally
intensive. We wish to optimize the search for both detection and computational
efficiencies. Methods: We assume that the searched systems can be well
described by Keplerian orbits. We then propagate the effects of different
system parameters to the detection parameters. Results: We show that the
frequency information content of the light curve is primarily determined by the
duty cycle of the transit signal, and thus the optimal frequency sampling is
found to be cubic and not linear. Further optimization is achieved by
considering duty-cycle dependent binning of the phased light curve. By using
the (standard) BLS one is either rather insensitive to long-period planets, or
less sensitive to short-period planets and computationally slower by a
significant factor of ~330 (for a 3yr long dataset). We also show how the
physical system parameters, such as the host star's size and mass, directly
affect transit detection. This understanding can then be used to optimize the
search for every star individually. Conclusions: By considering Keplerian
dynamics explicitly rather than implicitly one can optimally search the BLS
parameter space. The presented Optimal BLS enhances the detectability of both
very short and very long period planets while allowing such searches to be done
with much reduced resources and time. The Matlab/Octave source code for Optimal
BLS is made available.

are typically aggregated to more reliably infer ground-truth answers. We study
two approaches for crowd aggregation on multicategory answer spaces stochastic
modeling based and deterministic objective function based. Our stochastic model
for answer generation plausibly captures the interplay between worker skills,
intentions, and task difficulties and allows us to model a broad range of
worker types. Our deterministic objective based approach does not assume a
model for worker response generation. Instead, it aims to maximize the average
aggregate confidence of weighted plurality crowd decision making. In both
approaches, we explicitly model the skill and intention of individual workers,
which is exploited for improved crowd aggregation. Our methods are applicable
in both unsupervised and semisupervised settings, and also when the batch of
tasks is heterogeneous. As observed experimentally, the proposed methods can
defeat tyranny of the masses, they are especially advantageous when there is a

dynamics of the supernova bursts that produced the heavy elements necessary for
life and whether protons eventually decay --- these mysteries at the forefront
of particle physics and astrophysics are key to understanding the early
evolution of our Universe, its current state and its eventual fate. The
Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) represents an extensively developed
plan for a world-class experiment dedicated to addressing these questions. LBNE
is conceived around three central components: (1) a new, high-intensity
neutrino source generated from a megawatt-class proton accelerator at Fermi
National Accelerator Laboratory, (2) a near neutrino detector just downstream
of the source, and (3) a massive liquid argon time-projection chamber deployed
as a far detector deep underground at the Sanford Underground Research
Facility. This facility, located at the site of the former Homestake Mine in
Lead, South Dakota, is approximately 1,300 km from the neutrino source at
Fermilab -- a distance (baseline) that delivers optimal sensitivity to neutrino
charge-parity symmetry violation and mass ordering effects. This ambitious yet
cost-effective design incorporates scalability and flexibility and can
accommodate a variety of upgrades and contributions. With its exceptional
combination of experimental configuration, technical capabilities, and
potential for transformative discoveries, LBNE promises to be a vital facility
for the field of particle physics worldwide, providing physicists from around
the globe with opportunities to collaborate in a twenty to thirty year program
of exciting science. In this document we provide a comprehensive overview of
LBNE's scientific objectives, its place in the landscape of neutrino physics
worldwide, the technologies it will incorporate and the capabilities it will
possess.

semifield extensions of uniform layered semifields introduced by Izhakian
Knebusch and Rowen in the paper 'Layered tropical mathematics'. Our
construction includes a decomposition of a uniform extension of a uniformly
layered (uniform) semifield to the bipotent semifield extension of its
$\nu$-values semifield and a cancellative semifields extension of its layers
(sorting) semifield. We give a characterization of these two types of
semifields extensions in the first two sections of the paper. The third section
glues the pieces together to form a theory for a uniform extension of a
uniformly layered semifield.

polymers, which are perpendicularly grafted on a substrate. Such an attractive
interaction could be due to, e.g., reversible cross-links. The competition
between permanent grafting favoring a homogeneous state of the polymer brush
and the attraction, which tends to induce in-plane collapse of the aligned
polymers, gives rise to an instability of the homogeneous phase to a bundled
state. In this latter state the in-plane translational symmetry is
spontaneously broken and the density is modulated with a finite wavelength,
which is set by the length scale of transverse fluctuations of the grafted
polymers. We analyze the instability for two models of aligned polymers:
directed polymers with a line tension and weakly bending chains with a bending
stiffness.

extensive research on how to spread influence in online social networks, and
many algorithms and models have been proposed. However, many fundamental
problems have also been overlooked. Among those, the most important problems
are the incentive aspect and the privacy aspect (eg, nodes' relationships) of
the influence propagation in online social networks. Bearing these defects in
mind, and incorporating the powerful tool from differential privacy, we propose
PRINCE, which is a series of \underline{PR}ivacy preserving mechanisms for
\underline{IN}fluen\underline{CE} diffusion in online social networks to solve
the problems. We not only theoretically prove many elegant properties of
PRINCE, but also implement PRINCE to evaluate its performance extensively. The
evaluation results show that PRINCE achieves good performances. To the best of
our knowledge, PRINCE is the first differentially private mechanism for
influence diffusion in online social networks.

We prove that additive actions on projective hypersurfaces correspond to
invariant multilinear symmetric forms on local algebras. It allows us to obtain

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for their projects or conceptual designs.
The aim of this work is providing a review of basic properties (density,
viscosity, thermal conductivity and heat capacity) of the most common and
referred salt mixtures. After checking data, tabulated and graphical outputs
are given in order to offer the most suitable available values to be used as
input parameters for other calculations or simulations. The reviewed values
show a general scattering in characterization, mainly in thermal properties.

photo-multipliers camera raw data. Furthermore, a flexible archiving system has
being conceived for the storage of all the acquired ASTRI (scientific,

Property Testing, where traditionally the testing algorithm is allowed to pick

Preliminary findings tend to favour a two-stage model of collapse kinetics,
although a more complicated picture emerges when looking at the details of
cluster formation along the chain.

system driven by a light wavepacket prepared in a continuous-mode multi-photon
state. A continuous-mode multi-photon state is a state of a travelling light
wavepacket that contains a definite number of photons and is characterised by a
temporal (or equivalently spectral) profile. After the interaction with the
system, the outgoing light can be monitored by means of homodyne detection or
photodetection. Filters for both measurement schemes are derived in this paper.
Unlike the vacuum or the coherent state case, the annihilation operator of the
light field acting on a multi-photon state changes the state by annihilating a
photon, and this makes the traditional filtering techniques inapplicable. To
circumvent this difficulty, we adopt a non-Markovian embedding technique
proposed in \cite{gough:2013} for the study of the single-photon filtering
problem. However, the multi-photon nature of the problem addressed in this
paper makes the study much more mathematically involved. Moreover, as
demonstrated by an example --- a two-level system driven by a continuous-mode
two-photon state, multi-photon filters can reveal interesting strong nonlinear
optical phenomena absent in both the single-photon state case and the
continuous-mode Fock state case.

gas are studied in two spatial dimensions. After the system has undergone an
initial dynamical instability it approaches a non-thermal fixed point. At this
critical point the structure of the gas is characterised by ensembles of
(quasi-)topological defects such as vortices, skyrmions and solitons which give
rise to universal power-law behaviour of momentum correlation functions. The
resulting power-law spectra can be interpreted in terms of
strong-wave-turbulence cascades driven by particle transport into
long-wave-length excitations. Scaling exponents are determined on both sides of
the miscible-immiscible transition controlled by the ratio of the intra-species
to inter-species couplings. Making use of quantum turbulence methods, we
explain the specific values of the exponents from the presence of transient
(quasi-)topological defects.

response function at finite momentum and frequency. We first present the
minimal theory of the extrinsic lifetime of Dirac plasmons due to scattering

from the late stage of an inspiraling neutron star binary as presented in Ref.

We study the gravitational and electromagnetic waves produced during the
inspiral and merger of a binary neutron star system using a full relativistic,
resistive MHD evolution code. We show that the interaction between the stellar
magnetospheres extracts kinetic energy from the system and powers radiative
Poynting flux and heat dissipation. These features depend strongly on the
configuration of the initial stellar magnetic moments. Our results indicate
that this power can strongly outshine pulsars in binaries and have a
distinctive angular and time-dependent pattern. Our discussion provides more
detail than Ref. \cite{Palenzuela:2013hu}, showing clear evidence of the
different effects taking place during the inspiral. Our simulations include a
few milliseconds after the actual merger and study the dynamics of the magnetic
fields during the formation of the hypermassive neutron star. We also briefly
discuss the possibility of observing such emissions.

Our model is generic enough to include features of recent wireless networks

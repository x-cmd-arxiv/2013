hole binary carry linear momentum. This results in an astrophysically important
recoil to the final merged black hole, a ``kick'' that can eject it from the
nucleus of a galaxy. In a previous paper we showed that the puzzling partial
cancellation of an early kick by a late antikick, and the dependence of the
cancellation on black hole spin, can be understood from the phenomenology of
the linear momentum waveforms. Here we connect that phenomenology to its
underlying cause, the spin-dependence of the inspiral trajectories. This
insight suggests that the details of plunge can be understood more broadly with
a focus on inspiral trajectories.

  arXiv:0907.3394",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We discuss recent progress in understanding the launching of outflows/jets
from the disc-magnetosphere boundary of slowly and rapidly rotating magnetized
stars. In most of the discussed models the interior of the disc is assumed to
have a turbulent viscosity and magnetic diffusivity (as described by two
``alpha'' parameters), whereas the coronal region outside of the disc is
treated using ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD).
  Extensive MHD simulations have established the occurrence of long-lasting
outflows in both the cases of slowly and rapidly rotating stars. In the case of
{\it slowly rotating stars}, a new type of outflow, {\it a conical wind}, is
found and studied in simulations. The conical winds appear in cases where the
magnetic flux of the star is bunched up by the inward motion of the accretion
disc. Near their region of origin, the winds have the shape of a thin conical
shell with a half-opening angle of $ \sim 30^\circ$. At large distances these
outflows become magnetically collimated by their toroidal magnetic field and
form matter dominated jets. That is, the jets are current carrying. The
predominant driving force for the conical winds is the magnetic force
proportional to the negative gradient of the square of the toroidal magnetic
field and not the centrifugal force. In the case of {\it rapidly rotating
stars} in the ``propeller regime,'' a two-component outflow is observed. The
first component is similar to the matter dominated conical winds. A large
fraction of the disc matter may be ejected into the winds in this regime. The
second component is a high-velocity, low-density magnetically dominated {\it
axial jet} where matter flows along the opened polar field lines of the star.

The BP approach provides distributed heuristics for finding the Maximum A
Posteriori (MAP) assignment in a joint probability distribution represented by
a Graphical Model (GM) and respective LPs can be considered as continuous
relaxations of the discrete MAP problem. It was recently shown that a BP
algorithm converges to the correct MWM assignment under a simple GM formulation
of MAP/MWM as long as the corresponding LP relaxation is tight. First, under
the motivation for forcing the tightness condition, we consider a new GM
formulation of MWM, say C-GM, using non-intersecting odd-sized cycles in the
graph: the new corresponding LP relaxation, say C-LP, becomes tight for more
MWM instances. However, the tightness of C-LP now does not guarantee such
convergence and correctness of the new BP on C-GM. To address the issue, we
introduce a novel graph transformation applied to C-GM, which results in
another GM formulation of MWM, and prove that the respective BP on it converges
to the correct MAP/MWM assignment as long as C-LP is tight. Finally, we also
show that C-LP always has half-integral solutions, which leads to an efficient
BP-based MWM heuristic consisting of making sequential, `cutting plane',
modifications to the underlying GM. Our experiments show that this BP-based
cutting plane heuristic performs as well as that based on traditional LP

it is still a second order method) and thus high order composition methods are

sufficiency principle. This paper extends the classical sufficiency principle
to decentralized inference, i.e., data reduction needs to be achieved in a
decentralized manner. We examine the notions of local and global sufficient
statistics and the relationship between the two for decentralized inference
under different observation models. We then consider the impacts of
quantization on decentralized data reduction which is often needed when
communications among sensors are subject to finite capacity constraints. The
central question we intend to ask is: if each node in a decentralized inference
system has to summarize its data using a finite number of bits, is it still
optimal to implement data reduction using global sufficient statistics prior to
quantization? We show that the answer is negative using a simple example and
proceed to identify conditions under which sufficiency based data reduction
followed by quantization is indeed optimal. They include the well known case
when the data at decentralized nodes are conditionally independent as well as a
class of problems with conditionally dependent observations that admit
conditional independence structure through the introduction of an appropriately

that animals make intertemporal choices to optimize expected reward rates over
a limited temporal window; this window includes a past integration interval

future reward. Using this theory, we derive a mathematical expression for the
subjective representation of time. A unique contribution of our work is in
finding that the past integration interval directly determines the steepness of
temporal discounting and the nonlinearity of time perception. In so doing, our

long wave-length fluctuations. For $0<\alpha<4$ the inverse susceptibility
develops a set of continuous minima at wave vectors $|\vec k|=k_0(\alpha)$

$k_0\to 0$, making the competition between interactions ineffective for greater
values of $\alpha$.

interference between linked alleles reduces the efficiency of selection and
distorts patterns of genetic diversity. Inference of evolutionary history from
diversity shaped by linked selection requires an understanding of these
patterns. Here, we present a simple but powerful scaling analysis identifying
the unit of selection as the genomic ""linkage block"" with a characteristic
length determined in a self-consistent manner by the condition that the rate of
recombination within the block is comparable to the fitness differences between
different alleles of the block. We find that an asexual model with the strength
of selection tuned to that of the linkage block provides an excellent
description of genetic diversity and the site frequency spectra when compared
to computer simulations. This linkage block approximation is accurate for the
entire spectrum of strength of selection and is particularly powerful in
scenarios with many weakly selected loci. The latter limit allows us to
characterize coalescence, genetic diversity, and the speed of adaptation in the
infinitesimal model of quantitative genetics.

  Conformal Formulation of the Einstein Constraint Equations","25 pages, no figures",,,,"gr-qc math.AP math.DG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The conformal method has been effective for parametrizing solutions to the
Einstein constraint equations on closed 3-manifolds. However, it is still not
well-understood; for example, existence of solutions to the conformal equations
for zero or negative Yamabe metrics is still unknown without the so-called
``CMC'' or ``near-CMC'' assumptions. The first existence results without such
assumptions, termed the ``far-from-CMC'' case, were obtained by Holst, Nagy,
and Tsogtgerel in 2008 for positive Yamabe metrics. However, their results are
based on topological arguments, and as a result solution uniqueness is not
known. Indeed, Maxwell gave evidence in 2011 that far-from-CMC solutions are
not unique in certain cases. In this article, we provide further insight by
establishing a type of alternative theorem for general far-from-CMC solutions.
For a given manifold M that admits a metric of positive scalar curvature and
scalar flat metric g(0) with no conformal Killing fields, we first prove
existence of an analytic, one-parameter family of metrics g(z) through g(0)
such that R(g(z)) = z. Using this family of metrics and given data
(tau,sigma,rho,j), we form a one-parameter family of operators F((phi,w),z)
whose zeros satisfy the conformal equations. Applying Liapnuov-Schmidt
reduction, we determine an analytic solution curve for F((phi,w),z) = 0 through
a critical point where the linearization of F((phi,w),z) vanishes. The
regularity of this curve, the definition of F((phi,w),z), and the earlier
far-from-CMC results of Holst et al. allow us to then prove the following
alternative theorem for far-from-CMC solutions: either (1) there exists a z_1
>0 such that (positive Yamabe) solutions to the z_1-parameterized conformal
equations are non-unique; or (2) there exists z_2 < 0 such that (negative
Yamabe) solutions to the z_2-parameterized conformal equations exist.

quantum wells (mostly GaAs/GaAlAs heterostructures) in the presence of
quantizing magnetic fields as open systems in contact with outside reservoirs.
If a reservoir is sufficiently large, it pins the Fermi level to a certain
energy. As a result, in a varying external magnetic field, the thermodynamic
equilibrium will force oscillations of the electron density in and out of the
quantum well (QW). This leads to a number of physical phenomena in
magneto-transport, interband and intraband magneto-optics, magnetization,
magneto-plasma dispersion, etc. In particular, as first proposed by Baraff and
Tsui, the density oscillations in and out of QW lead to plateaus in the Integer
Quantum Hall Effect (IQHE) at values observed in experiments. The gathered
evidence, especially from magneto-optical investigations, allows us to conclude
that, indeed, in most GaAs/GaAlAs hetrostructures one deals with open systems
in which the electron density in QWs oscillates as the magnetic field varies.
Relation of the density oscillations to other factors, such as electron
localization, and their combined influence on the quantum transport in 2D
electron gases, is discussed. In particular, a validity of the classical
formula for the Hall resistivity {\rho}xy = B/Nec is considered. It is
concluded that the density oscillations are not sufficient to be regarded as
the only source of plateaus in IQHE, although such claims have been sometimes
made in the past and present. Still, our general conclusion is that the
reservoir approach should be included in various descriptions of 2D electron
gases in the present of a magnetic field. An attempt has been made to quote all
the relevant literature on the subject.

genetic variation, but these effects remain poorly understood when multiple
selected variants segregate in nearby regions of the genome. Classical
population genetics fails to account for interference between linked mutations,
which grows increasingly severe as the density of selected polymorphisms
increases. Here, we describe a simple limit that emerges when interference is
common, in which the fitness effects of individual mutations play a relatively
minor role. Instead, molecular evolution is determined by the variance in
fitness within the population, defined over an effectively asexual segment of
the genome (a ``linkage block''). We exploit this insensitivity in a new
``coarse-grained'' coalescent framework, which approximates the effects of many
weakly selected mutations with a smaller number of strongly selected mutations
with the same variance in fitness. This approximation generates accurate and
efficient predictions for the genetic diversity that cannot be summarized by a
simple reduction in effective population size. However, these results suggest a
fundamental limit on our ability to resolve individual selection pressures from
contemporary sequence data alone, since a wide range of parameters yield nearly
identical patterns of sequence variability.

testing ground for galaxy formation theory on small-scales. Our novel approach
was to investigate the clustering of the known Milky Way satellite galaxies and
to quantify the amount of substructure within their distribution using a
two-point correlation function statistic in each of three spaces: configuration
space, line-of-sight velocity space, and four-dimensional phase-space. These
results were compared to those for three sets of subhaloes in the Via Lactea II
Cold Dark Matter simulation defined to represent the luminous dwarfs. We found
no evidence at a significance level above 2-sigma of substructure within the
distribution of the Milky Way satellite galaxies in any of the three spaces.
The ""luminous"" subhalo sets are more strongly clustered than are the Milky Way
satellites in all three spaces and over a broader range of scales in
four-dimensional phase-space. Each of the ""luminous"" subhalo sets are clustered
as a result of substructure within their line-of-sight velocity space
distributions at greater than 3-sigma significance, whereas the Milky Way
satellite galaxies are randomly distributed in line-of-sight velocity space.
While our comparison is with only one Cold Dark Matter simulation, the
inconsistencies between the Milky Way satellite galaxies and the Via Lactea II
subhalo sets for all clustering methods suggest a potential new 'small-scale'
tension between Cold Dark Matter theory and the observed Milky Way satellites.
Future work will obtain a more robust comparison between the observed Milky Way
satellites and Cold Dark Matter theory by studying additional simulations.

error budget in the flux calibration for the individual bolometers, and tests
of the flux calibration on observations of primary and secondary calibrators.
The procedure for deriving the flux calibration parameters is divided into two
parts. In the first part, we use observations of astronomical sources in
conjunction with the operation of the photometer internal calibration source to
derive the unscaled derivatives of the flux calibration curves. To scale the
calibration curves in Jy/beam/V, we then use observations of Neptune in which
the beam of each bolometer is mapped using Neptune observed in a very fine scan
pattern. The total instrumental uncertainties in the flux calibration for the
individual bolometers is ~0.5% for most bolometers, although a few bolometers
have uncertainties of ~1-5% because of issues with the Neptune observations.
Based on application of the flux calibration parameters to Neptune observations
performed using typical scan map observing modes, we determined that
measurements from each array as a whole have instrumental uncertainties of
1.5%. This is considerably less than the absolute calibration uncertainty
associated with the model of Neptune, which is estimated at 4%.

field polarimeter we measured the fractional polarization of the earthshine in

110{\deg}. The phase dependence of the earthshine polarization is fitted by a
function p x sin(alpha)^2. To determine the polarization of the planet Earth we
correct our earthshine measurements by a polarization efficiency function for
the lunar surface derived from measurements of lunar samples from the
literature. The polarization of the earthshine decreases towards longer
wavelengths and is about a factor 1.3 lower for the higher albedo highlands.
For mare regions the measured maximum polarization is about 13 % at quadrature
in the B band. The resulting fractional polarizations for Earth are 24.6 % for
the B band, 19.1 % for the V band, 13.5 % for the R band, and 8.3 % for the I

obtain a contrast between the polarized flux of the Earth and the (total) flux

associated with the linearized Vlasov equation and with the linearized mean
field Smoluchowski equation are recovered as special cases corresponding to the

stability of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is independent on the friction
parameter, the evolution of the perturbation depends on it in a non-trivial

main-sequence of 47 Tuc into four color groups, which presumably represent
stars of various chemical compositions. The kinematic properties of each of
these groups is explored via proper-motions, and a strong signal emerges of
differing proper-motion anisotropies with differing main-sequence color; the
bluest main-sequence stars exhibit the largest proper-motion anisotropy which
becomes undetectable for the reddest stars. In addition, the bluest stars are
also the most centrally concentrated. A simiilar analysis for SMC stars, which

logarithmic or Gaussianization transformation, as efficient tools to recapture
information about the (Gaussian) initial conditions. During non-linear
evolution, part of the cosmologically relevant information leaks out from the
second moment of the distribution. This information is accessible only through
complex higher order moments or, in the worst case, becomes inaccessible to the
hierarchy. The focus of this work is to investigate these transformations in
the framework of Fisher information using cosmological perturbation theory of
the matter field with Gaussian initial conditions. We show that at each order
in perturbation theory, there is a polynomial of corresponding order exhausting
the information on a given parameter. This polynomial can be interpreted as the
Taylor expansion of the maximally efficient ""sufficient"" observable in the
non-linear regime. We determine explicitly this maximally efficient observable
for local transformations. Remarkably, this optimal transform is essentially
the simple power transform with an exponent related to the slope of the power
spectrum; when this is -1, it is indistinguishable from the logarithmic
transform. This transform Gaussianizes the distribution, and recovers the
linear density contrast. Thus a direct connection is revealed between undoing
of the non-linear dynamics and the efficient capture of Fisher information. Our
analytical results were compared with measurements from the Millennium
Simulation density field. We found that our transforms remain very close to
optimal even in the deeply non-linear regime with \sigma^2 \sim 10.

bands touch at points in momentum space, termed Weyl nodes, that are
characterized by a definite topological charge: the chirality. Consequently,
they exhibit the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly, which in this condensed matter
realization implies that application of parallel electric ($\mathbf{E}$) and
magnetic ($\mathbf{B}$) fields pumps electrons between nodes of opposite
chirality at a rate proportional to $\mathbf{E}\cdot\mathbf{B}$. We argue that
this pumping is measurable via nonlocal transport experiments, in the limit of
weak internode scattering. Specifically, we show that as a consequence of the
anomaly, applying a local magnetic field parallel to an injected current
induces a valley imbalance that diffuses over long distances. A probe magnetic
field can then convert this imbalance into a measurable voltage drop far from
source and drain. Such nonlocal transport vanishes when the injected current
and magnetic field are orthogonal, and therefore serves as a test of the chiral
anomaly. We further demonstrate that a similar effect should also characterize
Dirac semimetals --- recently reported to have been observed in experiments ---
where a pair of Weyl nodes coexisting at a single point in the Brillouin zone
are protected by a crystal symmetry. Since the nodes are analogous to valley
degrees of freedom in semiconductors, this suggests that valley currents in
three dimensional topological semimetals can be controlled using electric
fields, which has potential practical `valleytronic' applications.

using, e.g., the CAS and Gini-M20 statistics of Conselice (2003) and Lotz et

disturbance. We introduce three statistics that enhance detection of disturbed
morphologies at high-redshift (z ~ 2): the multi-mode (M), intensity (I), and
deviation (D) statistics. We show their effectiveness by training a
machine-learning classifier, random forest, using 1,639 galaxies observed in
the H band by the Hubble Space Telescope WFC3, galaxies that had been
previously classified by eye by the CANDELS collaboration (Grogin et al. 2011,

disturbance at high redshift, and that increasing their number beyond

essentially self-dual) automorphic representations over totally real fields,
finding associated geometric projective representations. Finally, we optimize
some of the Galois lifting results of arxiv:1207.6724 and apply them to the
previous mixed-parity setting.

together with the photon tagging facility at the Mainz Microtron MAMI. In the
present experiment, this reaction was searched for in the 3pi^0 p final state,
by assuming K^0_S -> pi^0 pi^0 and Sigma^+ -> pi^0 p. The experimental results
include total and differential cross sections as well as the polarization of
the recoil hyperon. The new data significantly improve empirical knowledge
about the g p -> K^0 Sigma^+ reaction in the measured energy range. The results
are compared to previous measurements and model predictions. It is demonstrated
that adding the present g p -> K^0 Sigma^+ results to existing data allowed a
better description of this reaction with various models.

transition between the vortex liquid state and the vortex crystal state. We
show, however, that these results are just an artifact of studying systems
which are too small. There are substantial difficulties in simulating larger
systems using traditional approaches. By means of the optimal energy diffusion
algorithm we have been able to study systems containing up to about one
thousand vortices, and for these larger systems the evidence for a first order

that the KTHNY scenario seems to apply, where melting from the crystal is first
to the hexatic liquid state and next to the normal vortex liquid, in both cases
via a continuous transition.

theory to occur when the up-down quark mass difference becomes sufficiently
large at fixed down-quark mass. Before reaching this phase, all physical

the up-quark mass, even as this mass passes through zero. In Euclidean space,
the topological susceptibility of the gauge fields is positive at positive
quark masses but diverges to negative infinity as the Dashen phase is

local Lorentz algebras, and that could describe the low energy particle
phenomenology is constructed. These two symmetries are connected by fermionic
supercharges. The system includes an internal gauge connection 1-form $A$, a
spin-1/2 Dirac spinor $\psi$, the Lorentz connection $\omega$, and the vielbein
$e$. The connection one-form is in the adjoint representation of G, while
$\psi$ is in the fundamental. In contrast to standard supergravity, the metric
is not a fundamental field and is in the center of the superalgebra: it is not
only invariant under the internal gauge group and under Lorentz
transformations, but is also invariant under supersymmetry. The features of
this theory that mark the difference with standard supersymmetry are: A) The
number of fermionic and bosonic states is not necessarily the same; B) There
are no superpartners with equal mass, ""bosoninos"", sleptons and squarks are
absent; C) Although this supersymmetry originates in a local gauge theory and
gravity is included, there is no gravitino; D) Fermions acquire mass from their
coupling to the background or from self-couplings, while bosons remain
massless. In odd dimensions, the Chern-Simons form provides an action that is
quasi-invariant under the entire superalgebra. In even dimensions, the
Yang-Mills form $ < F *F>$ is the only natural option, and the symmetry breaks
down to [G x SO(1,D-1)]. In 4D, the construction follows the Townsend - Mac
Dowell-Mansouri approach. Due to the absence of osp(4|2)-invariant traces in
four dimensions, the resulting Lagrangian is only invariant under [U(1) x
SO(3,1)], and includes a Nambu--Jona-Lasinio term. In this case, the Lagrangian
depends on a single dimensionful parameter that fixes Newton's constant, the
cosmological constant and the NJL coupling.

electroweak structure of mesons of arbitrary constituent-quark masses is
presented. The physical processes in which the structure is measured, i.e.
electron-meson scattering and semileptonic weak decays, are treated in a
Poincar\'e invariant way by making use of the point-form of relativistic
quantum mechanics. The electromagnetic and weak meson currents are extracted
from the 1-photon or 1-W-exchange amplitudes that result from a
Bakamjian-Thomas type mass operator for the respective systems. The covariant
decomposition of these currents provides the electromagnetic and weak
(transition) form factors. The formalism is first applied to the study of
heavy-light systems. Problems with cluster separability, which are inherent in
the Bakamjian-Thomas construction, are discussed and it is shown how to keep
them under control. It is proved that the heavy-quark limit of the electroweak
form factors leads to one universal function, the Isgur-Wise function,
confirming that the requirements of heavy-quark symmetry are satisfied. These
results are discussed and compared with analogous calculations in the front
form of dynamics. The formalism is further applied to the study of bound states
whose binding is caused by dynamical particle exchange. The problem of how to
take into account retardation effects in the particle-exchange potential is
formulated and it is shown how they affect the binding energy and wave-function
solution for a dynamical model of the deuteron. At the end of this work an
example where the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of the Poincar\'e group are
applied is presented. The angular momentum decomposition of chiral multiplets
is given in the instant and in the front forms.

demonstrate a technique using a nonlinear interaction between chirped entangled
time-bin photons and shaped laser pulses to perform projective measurements on
arbitrary time-bin states with picosecond-scale separations. We demonstrate a
tomographically-complete set of time-bin qubit projective measurements and show
the fidelity of operations is sufficiently high to violate the CHSH-Bell

laser pulses is studied in head-on collision geometry. It is shown that
electrons and/or positrons undergo a cascade-type process involving multiple
emissions of photons. These photons can consequently convert into
electron-positron pairs. As a result charged particles quickly lose their
energy developing an exponentially decaying energy distribution, which
suppresses the emission of high energy photons, thus reducing the number of
electron-positron pairs being generated. Therefore, this type of interaction
suppresses the development of the electromagnetic avalanche-type discharge,
i.e., the exponential growth of the number of electrons, positrons, and photons
does not occur in the course of interaction. The suppression will occur when 3D
effects can be neglected in the transverse particle orbits, i.e., for
sufficiently broad laser pulses with intensities that are not too extreme. The
final distributions of electrons, positrons, and photons are calculated for the
case of a high energy e-beam interacting with a counter-streaming, short
intense laser pulse. The energy loss of the e-beam, which requires a
self-consistent quantum description, plays an important role in this process,
as well as provides a clear experimental observable for the transition from the
classical to quantum regime of interaction.

the study of countable Borel equivalence relations and their structure under

  In this paper we are concerned with universal countable Borel quasi-orders,

with regard to Borel reducibility. We first establish that there is a universal
countable Borel quasi-order, and then establish that several countable Borel
quasi-orders are universal. An important example is an embeddability relation
on descriptive set theoretic trees.
  Our main result states that embeddability of finitely generated groups is a
universal countable Borel quasi-order, answering a question of Louveau and
Rosendal. This immediately implies that biembeddability of finitely generated
groups is a universal countable Borel equivalence relation. The same techniques
are also used to show that embeddability of countable groups is a universal
analytic quasi-order.
  Finally, we show that, up to Borel bireducibility, there are continuum-many
distinct countable Borel quasi-orders which symmetrize to a universal countable

probe of dark energy. Recent studies have shown that a single lens can provide
a distance measurement with 6-7 % accuracy (including random and systematic
uncertainties), provided sufficient data are available to determine the time
delay and reconstruct the gravitational potential of the deflector.
Gravitational-time delays are a low redshift (z~0-2) probe and thus allow one
to break degeneracies in the interpretation of data from higher-redshift probes
like the cosmic microwave background in terms of the dark energy equation of
state. Current studies are limited by the size of the sample of known lensed
quasars, but this situation is about to change. Even in this decade, wide field
imaging surveys are likely to discover thousands of lensed quasars, enabling
the targeted study of ~100 of these systems and resulting in substantial gains
in the dark energy figure of merit. In the next decade, a further order of
magnitude improvement will be possible with the 10000 systems expected to be
detected and measured with LSST and Euclid. To fully exploit these gains, we
identify three priorities. First, support for the development of software
required for the analysis of the data. Second, in this decade, small robotic
telescopes (1-4m in diameter) dedicated to monitoring of lensed quasars will
transform the field by delivering accurate time delays for ~100 systems. Third,
in the 2020's, LSST will deliver 1000's of time delays; the bottleneck will
instead be the aquisition and analysis of high resolution imaging follow-up.
Thus, the top priority for the next decade is to support fast high resolution
imaging capabilities, such as those enabled by the James Webb Space Telescope
and next generation adaptive optics systems on large ground based telescopes.

spin Hamiltonian-type model to predict molecular magnets (MMs) with magnetic
moments that are intrinsically robust under random shape deformations to the
molecule. Using the concept of convergence in probability, we show that for MMs
in which all spin centers lie in-plane and all spin center interactions are
ferromagnetic, the total spin of the molecule is a `weak topological invariant'
when the number of spin centers is sufficiently large. By weak topological
invariant, we mean that the total spin of the molecule only depends upon the
arrangement of spin centers in the molecule, and is unlikely to change under
shape deformations to the molecule. Our calculations show that only between 20
and 50 spin centers are necessary for the total spin of these MMs to be a weak
topological invariant. The robustness effect is particularly enhanced for 2D
ferromagnetic MMs that possess a small number of spin rings in the structure.

particular their key rate theory is not correct. Theory groups of QKD tried to
improve several defects. Especially, Renner employed trace distance and quantum
leftover Hash Lemma. However, the present theory encountered a problem of a
quantitative evaluation of security. To cope with it, he uses a wrong
interpretation on the trace distance and its level epsilon_{sec}, and justifies
the unconditional security of own system when epsilon_{sec} is 10^{-6 } ~
10^{-20}. In this paper, we discuss the following problems. What is the origin
of the misconception of the present theory? How does the present theory lead to
the misconception?. To show their process toward the misconception,
Koashi-Preskill's theory which has a typical misconception is examined. A main
point of our comment is that QKD theory ignores the security requirement
against attacker which is necessary to compare whole encryption schemes from
classical to quantum. To clarify it, we emphasize that the trace distance
itself cannot have any operational meaning such as failure probability, and it
is only mathematical tool as a measure of closeness. As a result, it is given
that the security with above values derived from their formulation means
nothing in the general cryptological sense. In addition, I point out that a
comment by Bennett and Riedel on unconditional security of QKD is not correct.
Also, I point out that the experimental systems of groups of Los Alamos,
Toshiba-UK, NICT, and others cannot have security guarantee even in future.

automate program repair, which is often an unachievable goal, MintHint performs
statistical correlation analysis to identify expressions that are likely to

suggest how to rectify a faulty statement and help developers find a complete,
actual repair. MintHint can address a variety of common faults, including

  We present a user study that shows that developers' productivity can improve
manyfold with the use of repair hints generated by MintHint -- compared to
having only traditional fault localization information. We also apply MintHint
to several faults of a widely used Unix utility program to further assess the

Milky Way cause a systematic observational effect on the stellar proper
motions, which was first studied in the early 1990s and developed by J.
Kovalevsky (aberration in proper motions, 2003, A&A, 404, 743). This paper
intends to extend that work and aims to estimate the magnitude and significance
of the aberration in proper motions of stars, especially in the region near the
Galactic center. We adopt two models for the Galactic rotation curve to
evaluate the aberrational effect on the Galactic plane. Based on the
theoretical developments, we show that the effect of aberration in proper
motions depends on the galactocentric distance of stars; it is dominated by the
acceleration of stars in the central region of the Galaxy. Within 200 pc from
the Galactic center, the systematic proper motion can reach an amplitude larger
than 1000 uas/yr by applying a flat rotation curve. With a more realistic
rotation curve which is linearly rising in the core region of the Galaxy, the
aberrational proper motions are limited up to about 150 uas/yr. Then we
investigate the applicability of the theoretical expressions concerning the
aberrational proper motions, especially for those stars with short period
orbits. If the orbital period of stars is only a fraction of the light time
from the star to the SSB, the expression proposed by Kovalevsky is not
appropriate. With a more suitable formulation, we found that the aberration has
no effect on the determination of the stellar orbits on the celestial sphere.
The aberrational effect under consideration is small but not negligible with
high-accurate astrometry in the future, particularly in constructing the Gaia
celestial reference system realized by Galactic stars.

expansion rate $H$ and involves both $\rho_{\rm de}$ and $\rho_{\rm dm}$.
Moreover, the new initial condition for the agegraphic dark energy is used,
which solves the problem of accommodating baryon matter and radiation in the
model. The solution of the model can be given using an iterative algorithm. A
concrete example for the calculation of the model is given. Furthermore, the
model is constrained by using the combined Planck data (Planck+BAO+SNIa+$H_0$)
and the combined WMAP-9 data (WMAP+BAO+SNIa+$H_0$). Three typical cases are
considered: (A) $Q=bH_0\rho_{\rm de}$, (B) $Q=bH_0\sqrt{\rho_{\rm de}\rho_{\rm

0, respectively. The departures of the models from the $\Lambda$CDM model are
measured by the $\Delta$BIC and $\Delta$AIC values. It is shown that the INADE
model is better than the NADE model in the fit, and the INADE(A) model is the
best in fitting data among the three cases.

possibly lead to the invisible decay $h^0 \rightarrow \tilde \chi_1^0 \tilde

delineate the regions of the NMSSM parameter space where it is possible to have
the lightest Higgs boson to have a mass of about $126$ GeV, and then
concentrate on the region where this Higgs can decay into light neutralinos,
with the soft gaugino masses $M_1$ and $M_2$ as two independent parameters,

``What is the smallest number $s$ such that any generic homogeneous polynomial

sift through various capacity-impacting parameters and present a simple
relationship that can be used to estimate the capacity of both static and

by the average number of simultaneous transmissions, the link capacity and the
average number of transmissions required to deliver a packet to its
destination. Our result is valid for both finite networks and asymptotically
infinite networks. We then use this result to explain and better understand the
insights of some existing results on the capacity of static networks, mobile
networks and hybrid networks and the multicast capacity. The capacity analysis
using the aforementioned relationship often becomes simpler. The relationship
can be used as a powerful tool to estimate the capacity of different networks.
Our work makes important contributions towards developing a generic methodology
for network capacity analysis that is applicable to a variety of different
scenarios.

advanced to tremendously improve the performance of wireless networks. However,
the use of very large antenna arrays brings new issues, such as the
significantly increased hardware cost and signal processing cost and
complexity. In order to reap the enormous gain of massive MIMO and yet reduce
its cost to an affordable level, this paper proposes a novel system design by
integrating an electromagnetic (EM) lens with the large antenna array, termed
\emph{electromagnetic lens antenna} (ELA). An ELA has the capability of
focusing the power of any incident plane wave passing through the EM lens to a
small subset of the antenna array, while the location of focal area is
dependent on the angle of arrival (AoA) of the wave. As compared to
conventional antenna arrays without the EM lens, the proposed system can
substantially reduce the number of required radio frequency (RF) chains at the
receiver and hence, the implementation costs. In this paper, we investigate the
proposed system under a simplified single-user uplink transmission setup, by
characterizing the power distribution of the ELA as well as the resulting
channel model. Furthermore, by assuming antenna selection used at the receiver,
we show the throughput gains of the proposed system over conventional antenna
arrays given the same number of selected antennas.

Decoherence is then accounted for non-perturbatively, and population relaxation
using a Markovian master equation. Analytical results can be obtained for the
seven level system and the calculations are very simple for systems with more

excellent agreement with the exact numerical results of Nalbach et al. (P.
Nalbach, D. Braun, and M. Thorwart, Physical Review E, 84, 041926 (2011)). Our
approach is able to account for decoherence and population relaxation
separately. It is found that decoherence only causes damping of oscillations,
and does not lead to transfer to the reaction centre. Population relaxation is
necessary for efficient transfer to the reaction centre, in agreement with
earlier findings. Our results show that the transformation to the adiabatic

agreement with exact simulation.

a result, the first two generations of squarks acquire masses of about 7 TeV,
and the first generation of the sleptons do those of 40 TeV, respectively, in
the presence of one or three pairs of extra vector-like matter {{\bf
5},\bar{\bf 5}}. Non-observation on extra colored particles below 1 TeV at the
large hadron collider, and also the flavor violations such as \mu^-\rightarrow
e^-\gamma are explained. By virtue of such a gauge symmetry, proton stability

heavy sfermions can protect the smallness of the stop mass from the radiative

enhance the radiative corrections to the Higgs mass up to 126 GeV, and induce

sampling units are related to each other according to a tree. The residual
covariance is parametrized using the tree-distance between sampling units. When
observations are modeled using an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process along the
tree, the autocorrelation between two tips decreases exponentially with their
tree distance. These models are most often applied in evolutionary biology,
when tips represent biological species and the OU process parameters represent
the strength and direction of natural selection. For these models, we show that
the mean is not microergodic: no estimator can ever be consistent for this

parameters, we give a general sufficient condition ensuring microergodicity.
This condition suggests that some parameters may not be estimated at the same
rate as others. We show that, indeed, maximum likelihood estimators of the
autocorrelation parameter converge at a slower rate than that of generally
microergodic parameters. We showed this theoretically in a symmetric tree

capable of determining the risky states of the system, when there are only a
few of them. If there are many, then the method may not explore each one in the

angular momentum are accreted by the gainer star which can be accelerated up to
its critical Keplerian velocity. The fate of the gainer once it reaches this
critical value is unclear. We investigate the orbital and stellar spin
evolution in semi-detached binary systems, specifically for systems with
rapidly rotating accretors. Our aim is to better distinguish between the
different spin-down mechanisms proposed which can consistently explain the slow
rotation observed in Algols' final states and assess the degree of
non-conservatism due to the formation of a hotspot. We use our state-of-the-art
binary evolution code, Binstar, which incorporates a detailed treatment of the
orbital and stellar spin, including all torques due to mass transfer, the
interactions between a star and its accretion disc, tidal effects and magnetic
braking. We also present a new prescription for mass loss due to the formation
of a hotspot based on energy conservation. The coupling between the star and
the disc via the boundary layer prevents the gainer from exceeding the critical
rotation. Magnetic-field effects, although operating, are not the dominant
spin-down mechanism for sensible field strengths. Spin down owing to tides is
2-4 orders of magnitudes too weak to compensate the spinning-up torque due to
mass accretion. Moreover, we find that the final separation strongly depends on
the spin-down mechanism. The formation of a hotspot leads to a large event of
mass loss during the rapid phase of mass transfer. The degree of conservatism
strongly depends on the opacity of the impacted material. A statistical study
as well as new observational constraints are needed to find the optimal set of
parameters (magnetic-field strength, hotspot geometry,...) to reproduce Algol
evolutions.

testable with $q$ queries if there exists an algorithm that distinguishes, with
high probability, inputs in $P'$ from inputs $\epsilon$-far from $P$ by using
$q$ queries. There are natural properties that require many queries to test,
but can be partitioned into a small number of subsets for which they are
partially testable with very few queries.
  We prove the existence of a property $P$ such that the only subsets $P'$ for
which $P$ is $P'$-partially testable are very small. To prove this we introduce
new techniques for proving property testing lower bounds. In addition to
obtaining some broad-brush criteria for non-testability, this implies a lower
bound on the possibility of PCPPs with a sublinear proof. This also implies
lower bounds on MAPs, a notion newly defined by Gur and Rothblum.
  The new techniques rely on analyzing a proposed partial tester. We show that
the queries performed by a tester must, with high probability, query indexes
where a uniformly random member of the sub-property has low entropy. We then
show how one can aggregate the ""entropy loss"" to deduce that a random choice in
the sub-property must have low entropy, and therefore the sub-property must be
small.
  We develop two techniques for aggregating the entropy loss. A simpler
technique that applies to non-adaptive testers is based on partitioning the
input bits into high query probability parts and parts where there is an
entropy loss when conditioned on the high probability parts. Against adaptive
testers we develop a technique based on constructing a decision tree. The
root-to-leaf paths in this tree rearrange the input into parts where each
exhibits entropy loss when conditioned on the path prefix. This decision tree
is constructed by combining carefully selected decision trees from those used
by the adaptive testing algorithm.

account in the analysis of diverse issues related to the notions of inertial
motion and inertial reference frame. Einstein's physical geometry enables a
non-conventional view on Euclidean geometry (as the geometry associated to
inertial motion and inertial reference frames) and on the uniform time. Also,
by taking into account the implications of the view of geometry as a physical
geometry, it is presented a critical reassessment of the so-called boostability
assumption (implicit according to Einstein in the formulation of the theory)
and also of 'alternative' derivations of the Lorentz transformations that do
not take into account the so-called 'light postulate'. Finally it is addressed
the issue of the eventual conventionality of the one-way speed of light or,
what is the same, the conventionality of simultaneity (within the same inertial
reference frame). It turns out that it is possible to see the (possible)
conventionality of distant simultaneity as a case of conventionality of
geometry (in Einstein's reinterpretation of Poincar\'e's views). By taking into
account synchronization procedures that do not make reference to light
propagation (which is necessary in the derivation of the Lorentz
transformations without the 'light postulate'), it can be shown that the
synchronization of distant clocks does not need any conventional element. This
implies that the whole of chronogeometry (and because of this the physical part
of the theory) does not have any conventional element in it, and it is a
physical chronogeometry.

functions is a non-trivial task. Assuming either axial or translational
symmetry, expressions depending on two scalar potentials alone are derived here
for \emph{all} TT tensors in flat $3$-space. In a more general spatial slice,
only one of these potentials is found, the same potential given in
\cite{BakerPuzio} and \cite{Dain}, with the remaining equations reduced to a
partial differential equation, depending on boundary conditions for a solution.
As an exercise, we also derive the potentials which give the Bowen-York

Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stt1699",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We develop a dust efflux model of radiation pressure acting on dust grains
which successfully reproduces the relation between stellar mass, dust opacity
and star formation rate observed in local star-forming galaxies. The dust
content of local star-forming galaxies is set by the competition between the
physical processes of dust production and dust loss in our model. The dust loss
rate is proportional to the dust opacity and star formation rate. Observations
of the relation between stellar mass and star formation rate at several epochs
imply that the majority of local star-forming galaxies are best characterized
as having continuous star formation histories. Dust loss is a consequence of
sustained interaction of dust with the radiation field generated by continuous
star formation. Dust efflux driven by radiation pressure rather than dust
destruction offers a more consistent physical interpretation of the dust loss
mechanism. By comparing our model results with the observed relation between
stellar mass, dust extinction and star formation rate in local star-forming
galaxies we are able to constrain the timescale and magnitude of dust loss. The
timescale of dust loss is long and therefore dust is effluxed in a ""Slow Flow"".
Dust loss is modest in low mass galaxies but massive galaxies may lose up to
70~80% of their dust over their lifetime. Our Slow Flow model shows that mass
loss driven by dust opacity and star formation may be an important physical
process for understanding normal star-forming galaxy evolution.

their functions or interactions with other molecules. It is commonly admitted
that, when proteins fold from their primary linear structures to their final 3D
conformations, they tend to choose the ones that minimize their free energy. To
find the 3D conformation of a protein knowing its amino acid sequence,
bioinformaticians use various models of different resolutions and artificial
intelligence tools, as the protein folding prediction problem is a NP complete
one. More precisely, to determine the backbone structure of the protein using
the low resolution models (2D HP square and 3D HP cubic), by finding the
conformation that minimize free energy, is intractable exactly. Both the proof
of NP-completeness and the 2D prediction consider that acceptable conformations
have to satisfy a self-avoiding walk (SAW) requirement, as two different amino
acids cannot occupy a same position in the lattice. It is shown in this
document that the SAW requirement considered when proving NP-completeness is
different from the SAW requirement used in various prediction programs, and
that they are different from the real biological requirement. Indeed, the proof
of NP completeness and the predictions in silico consider conformations that
are not possible in practice. Consequences of this fact are investigated in
this research work.

be stretched ever further along the orbit in position-velocity space. A
fraction of its emission appears to be already emerging on the blue-shifted

stretched over more than 15,000 Schwarzschild radii RS around the pericenter of
the orbit, at ~ 2000 RS ~ 20 light hours from the black hole. The pericenter
passage of G2 will be a process stretching over a period of at least one year.

years, to within +- 25%, as have the line ratios Brackett-{\gamma} /

hydrodynamical interactions with the hot gas around the black hole, from a
ballistic orbit of an initially compact cloud with moderate velocity
dispersion. The constant luminosity and the increasingly stretched appearance

Suzaku and Chandra observations towards 1RXS J175911.0-344921, which is an
unidentified X-ray source listed in the ROSAT Bright Source Catalogue. A
conspicuous emission line at 6 keV was also found in the Suzaku J1759-3450
spectrum. Assuming the emission line to be K emission from He-like Fe ions, we
inferred Suzaku J1759-3450 to be an extragalactic object located at z = 0.13.
The radial profile of the surface brightness in the 0.5-10 keV band was
explained well with an isothermal beta-model of r_c = 1.61' and beta = 0.78.
The X-ray spectrum was well reproduced by an optically-thin thermal plasma with
the electron temperature of kT_e = 5.3 keV attenuated by the photoelectric
absorption of N_H = 2.3 x 10^21 cm^-2. The bolometric X-ray luminosity of L_X
(r < r_500) = 4.3 x 10^44 erg s^-1 is consistent with that expected from the
L_X-T relation of clusters of galaxies. In terms of the spatial extent, the
X-ray spectrum, and the bolometric luminosity of the X-ray emitting gas, we
concluded that Suzaku J1759-3450 is a new cluster of galaxies.

that occurs in the wake up to distances of the order of its diameter: the
particle pacifies turbulent fluctuations and reduces the energy dissipation

presented to draw an analogy between particle effects on turbulence and wall

Although, STEREO observations now provide a multiple view of CMEs in the
heliosphere, the true speeds derived from stereoscopic reconstruction of SECCHI
coronagraph data are not quite sufficient in accurate forecasting of arrival
time of a majority of CMEs at the Earth. This is due to many factors which
change the CME kinematics, like interaction of two or more CMEs or the
interaction of CMEs with the pervading solar wind. In order to understand the
propagation of CMEs, we have used the 3D triangulation method on SECCHI
coronagraph (COR2) images, and geometric triangulation on the J-maps
constructed from Heliospheric Imagers HI1 and HI2 images for eight
Earth-directed CMEs observed during 2008-2010. Based on the reconstruction, and
implementing the Drag Based Model for the distance where the CMEs could not be
tracked unambiguously in the interplanetary medium, the arrival time of these

actual arrival time as observed by \textit{in-situ} instruments. The analysis
reveals the importance of heliospheric imaging for improved forecasting of the

of the clustering of the property of interest, in our case, the cluster X-ray
luminosity. Using a suite of halo catalogs extracted from N-body simulations
and realistic estimates of the mass X-ray luminosity relation, we measured
these statistics with their corresponding covariance matrices. By carrying out
a Fisher matrix analysis, we quantified the content of information (by means of
a figure-of merit) encoded in the amplitude, shape, and full shape of our
probes for two-point statistics. The full shape of the luminosity power
spectrum, when analyzed up to scales of k~0.2 h/Mpc, yields a figure of merit
which is two orders of magnitude above the figure obtained from the unweighted
power spectrum, and only one order of magnitude below the value encoded in
X-ray luminosity function estimated from the same sample. This is a significant
improvement over the analysis developed with the standard (i.e., unweighted)
clustering probes. The measurements of the clustering of galaxy clusters and
its explicit dependence on the cluster intrinsic properties can contribute to
improving the degree of knowledge regarding the underlying links between

galactic environments where they are produced, and interact at long distances
with the inter-galactic medium, potentially having a significant contribution
to the heating and reionization of the early Universe. The two most important
sources of X-ray photons in the Universe are active galactic nuclei (AGN) and
X-ray binaries (XRBs). In this Letter we use results from detailed, large scale
population synthesis simulations to study the energy feedback of XRBs, from the
first galaxies (z~ 20) until today. We estimate that X-ray emission from XRBs
dominates over AGN at z>6-8. The shape of the spectral energy distribution of
the emission from XRBs shows little change with redshift, in contrast to its
normalization which evolves by ~4 orders of magnitude, primarily due to the
evolution of the cosmic star-formation rate. However, the metallicity and the
mean stellar age of a given XRB population affect significantly its X-ray
output. Specifically, the X-ray luminosity from high-mass XRBs per unit of
star-formation rate varies an order of magnitude going from solar metallicity
to less than 10% solar, and the X-ray luminosity from low-mass XRBs per unit of
stellar mass peaks at an age of ~300 Myr and then decreases gradually at later
times, showing little variation for mean stellar ages > 3 Gyr. Finally, we
provide analytical and tabulated prescriptions for the energy output of XRBs,
that can be directly incorporated in cosmological simulations.

optoelectronic devices at the nanoscale. Here we explore a new strategy, where
SiGe structures are laterally confined by the Si substrate, to obtain high
tensile strain avoiding the use of external stressors, and thus improving the
scalability. Spectro-microscopy techniques, finite element method simulations
and ab initio calculations are used to investigate the strain state of
laterally confined Ge-rich SiGe nano-stripes. Strain information is obtained by
tip enhanced Raman spectroscopy with an unprecedented lateral resolution of ~
30 nm. The nano-stripes exhibit a large tensile hydrostatic strain component,
which is maximum at the center of the top free surface, and becomes very small
at the edges. The maximum lattice deformation is larger than the typical values
of thermally relaxed Ge/Si(001) layers. This strain enhancement originates from
a frustrated relaxation in the out-of-plane direction, resulting from the
combination of the lateral confinement induced by the substrate side walls and
the plastic relaxation of the misfit strain in the (001) plane at the SiGe/Si
interface. The effect of this tensile lattice deformation at the stripe surface
is probed by work function mapping, performed with a spatial resolution better
than 100 nm using X-ray photoelectron emission microscopy. The nano-stripes
exhibit a positive work function shift with respect to a bulk SiGe alloy,
quantitatively confirmed by electronic structure calculations of tensile
strained configurations. The present results have a potential impact on the
design of optoelectronic devices at a nanometer length scale.

through the observation of earth matter effects. Magnetized iron calorimeters
have been shown to be good in this regard due to their charge identification
capabilities. The charged current interaction of $\nu_\mu$ in this detector,
produces a muon track and a hadron shower. The direction of the muon track can
be measured very accurately. We show the improvement expected in the reach of
this class of experiments to the neutrino mass hierarchy, as we improve the
muon energy resolution and the muon reconstruction efficiency. We next propose
to include the hadron events in the analysis, by tagging them with the zenith
angle of the corresponding muon and binning the hadron data first in energy and
then in zenith angle. To the best of our knowledge this way of performing the
analysis of the atmospheric neutrino data has not be considered before. We show
that the hadron events increase the mass hierarchy sensitivity of the
experiment. Finally, we show the expected mass hierarchy sensitivity in terms
of the reconstructed neutrino energy and zenith angle. We show how the detector
resolutions spoil the earth matter effects in the neutrino channel and argue
why the sensitivity obtained from the neutrino analysis cannot be significantly
better than that obtained from the analysis using muon data alone. As a result,
the best mass hierarchy sensitivity is obtained when we add the contribution of
the muon and the hadron data. For $\sin^22\theta_{13}=0.1$,
$\sin^2\theta_{23}=0.5$, a muon energy resolution of 2\%, reconstruction
efficiency of 80\% and exposure of $50\times 10$ kton-year, we could get up to
$4.5\sigma$ signal for the mass hierarchy from combining the muon and hadron

more than one viewpoint or scenario. The problem of aggregating multiple
criteria to obtain a globalizing objective function is of special interest when
the number of Pareto solutions becomes considerably large or when a single,
meaningful solution is required. Ordered Weighted Average or Ordered Median
operators are very useful when preferential information is available and
objectives are comparable since they assign importance weights not to specific
objectives but to their sorted values. In this paper, Ordered Weighted Average
optimization problems are studied from a modeling point of view. Alternative
integer programming formulations for such problems are presented and their
respective domains studied and compared. In addition, their associated
polyhedra are studied and some families of facets and new families of valid
inequalities presented. The proposed formulations are particularized for two
well-known combinatorial optimization problems, namely, shortest path and
minimum cost perfect matching, and the results of computational experiments
presented and analyzed. These results indicate that the new formulations
reinforced with appropriate constraints can be effective for efficiently
solving medium to large size instances.

(""polynomial-time functions""), consisting of all polynomially balanced
polynomial-time computable partial functions. Then P is not equal to NP iff fP
is a non-regular semigroup. The one-way functions considered here are based on
worst-case complexity (they are not cryptographic); they are the non-regular
elements of fP. We prove various properties of fP, e.g., that it is finitely
generated. We define reductions with respect to which certain universal one-way
functions are fP-complete.

Media Independent Handover (MIH) and Access Network Discovery and Selection
Function (ANDSF), respectively. These mechanisms enable a seamless Vertical
Handover (VHO) between the different types of technologies (3GPP and non-3GPP),
such as GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication), Wireless Fidelity (Wi-
Fi), Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), Universal Mobile
Telecommunications System (UMTS) and Long Term Evolution (LTE). In this paper,
we overview these mechanisms and show their components, benefits and drawbacks.
Then we present our Imperative Alternative MIH for Vertical Handover (I AM 4
VHO) approach based on the approaches that have been studied in the literature
with better performance (packet loss and latency), less connection failure
(probability of reject sessions), less complexity and more exhaustive for
enhancing VHO heterogeneous wireless networks environment.

equation in the electromagnetic external fields of simple configurations -- the
constant homogeneous field, the linearly polarized plane wave (in particular,
the constant uniform crossed field), and the circularly polarized plane wave --
are found. The solutions to the Landau-Lifshitz equation for the external
electromagnetic fields admitting a two-parametric symmetry group, which include
as a particular case the above mentioned field configurations, are obtained.
General properties of the total radiation power of a charged particle are
established. In particular, for a circularly polarized wave and constant
uniform crossed fields, the total radiation power in the asymptotic regime is
independent of the charge and the external field strength, when expressed in
terms of the proper-time, and equals a half of the rest energy of a charged
particle divided by its proper-time. The spectral densities of the radiation
power formed on the late time asymptotics are derived for a charged particle
moving in the external electromagnetic fields of the simple configurations
pointed above.

(referred to as B), which included the following suppositions: (1) B has
arrived at the aged period and generally cannot emit observable light; (2) The
PSR J0737-3039A (referred to as A) is dynamic and is encircled by dense charged
particles. When A revolves along its orbit, some of the particles are scattered
and form a particle cloud band along its orbit; (3) When passing the two
intersection points of the orbits, B goes through the cloud band and drives the
cloud particles to emit light; (4) Generally, B passes twice through the cloud
band every orbit cycle; hence, there are two bright phases along the orbit. (5)
It is the complexities of the distribution of the cloud particles and B's
emission region that cause the bright phases to drift away from the orbit
intersections. We also provide two predictions for the coming performance of B
to test our model.

into it the concept of spin of 1/2. The developed spinorial version of our
theory has many important features identical to those of the Dirac theory such
as the gyromagnetic ratio, expressions for currents including the spin current,
and antimatter states. In our theory the concepts of charge and anticharge
relate naturally to their ""spin"" in its rest frame in two opposite directions.
An important difference with the Dirac theory is that both the charge and
anticharge energies are positive whereas their frequencies have opposite signs.

meta information needed to automatically transform plain Java programs into
parallel code that can be run on multicore workstation. Programmers just need
to decorate the methods that will eventually be executed in parallel with
standard Java annotations. Annotations are automatically processed at
launch-time and parallel byte code is derived. Once in execution the program
automatically retrieves the information about the executing platform and
evaluates the information specified inside the annotations to transform the
byte-code into a semantically equivalent multithreaded version, depending on
the target architecture features. The results returned by the annotated
methods, when invoked, are futures with a wait-by-necessity semantics.

manifold. Given we accept such view, the space of functions in operator
representation becomes probability amplitudes f(x) of a particle. Since the
probabilistic interpretation of f(x) module follows from f(x) and f*(x)
duality, the problem of finding representation of wave function reduces to
Frobenius theorem for division algebras. We then construct the gravity model
and the model of strong interactions as a logical implication of the extension
of fields interaction algebra to non-associative algebra of octonions. The
application of Penrouse approach in spinor representation of space-time
combined with the proposed approach further leads us to chirality of
interactions and absence of right neutrino and left spinors in singleton state.
We also show the obtained model is consistent with general theory of relativity
and SU(3) for distances larger than Planck length. The obtained model also
contains the generalization of general theory of relativity to the model with
torsion given the chirality of the field. Importantly, the application of our
approach gives us Einstein equation with gravity constant equal to squared
Planck mass as consequence of non-associativity of interactions fields. We
construct strong interaction model based on matrix representation of octonion
algebra with special multiplication rule. The strong interaction is induced by
vector fields of octonion algebra with constant gravity force, which is in turn
induced by a pair of charged $W$ vector bosons from standard theory of weak
interactions. The problem of quark confinement is presented as a spinor
solution inside ""black hole"".

apply fuzzy logic in text mining in order to perform document clustering. We
took an example of document clustering where the documents had to be clustered
into two categories. The method involved cleaning up the text and stemming of
words. Then, we chose m number of features which differ significantly in their
word frequencies (WF), normalized by document length, between documents
belonging to these two clusters. The documents to be clustered were represented
as a collection of m normalized WF values. Fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm was
used to cluster these documents into two clusters. After the FCM execution
finished, the documents in the two clusters were analysed for the values of
their respective m features. It was known that documents belonging to a
document type, say X, tend to have higher WF values for some particular
features. If the documents belonging to a cluster had higher WF values for
those same features, then that cluster was said to represent X. By fuzzy logic,
we not only get the cluster name, but also the degree to which a document
belongs to a cluster.

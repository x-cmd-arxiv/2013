one-dimensional Dirac oscillator, a paradigm in exactly solvable relativistic
systems. The experiment relies on a relation of the Dirac oscillator to a
corresponding tight-binding system. This tight-binding system is implemented as
a microwave system by a chain of coupled dielectric disks, where the coupling
is evanescent and can be adjusted appropriately. The resonances of the finite
microwave system yields the spectrum of the one-dimensional Dirac oscillator
with and without mass term. The flexibility of the experimental set-up allows
the implementation of other one-dimensional Dirac type equations.

reported. The analysis is based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of 1.0 fb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7 TeV$, collected
with the LHCb detector. A yield of $30 \pm 6$ $B_s^0 \rightarrow
(K^+K^-)(K^-\pi^+)$ decays is found in the mass windows $1012.5 < M(K^+K^-) <
1026.5 MeV/c^2$ and $746 < M(K^-\pi^+)< 1046 MeV/c^2$. The signal yield is
found to be dominated by $B_s^0 \rightarrow \phi \bar{K}^{*0}$ decays, and the
corresponding branching fraction is measured to be ${\cal B}(B_s^0 \rightarrow
\phi \bar{K}^{*0}) = (1.10 \pm 0.24 (stat) \pm 0.14 (syst) \pm 0.08 (f_d/f_s))
\times 10^{-6}$, where the uncertainties are statistical, systematic and from
the ratio of fragmentation fractions $f_d/f_s$ which accounts for the different
production rate of $B^0$ and $B_s^0$ mesons. The significance of $B_s^0
\rightarrow \phi \bar{K}^{*0}$ signal is 6.1 standard deviations. The fraction
of longitudinal polarization in $B_s^0 \rightarrow \phi \bar{K}^{*0}$ decays is
found to be $f_0 = 0.51 \pm 0.15 (stat) \pm 0.07 (syst)$.

obtain the renormalization of the quasiparticle residue Z, the Fermi velocity,

be defined for two statistically equivalent but different matrices $\mathsf{A}$

Compared with protein residue networks with randomized links, the probability
of a walk being successful is lower and the length of successful walks shorter
in (non-randomized) protein residue networks. Fewer successful walks and
shorter successful walks point to higher communication specificity between
protein residues, a conceivably favourable attribute for proteins to have. The
use of random walks instead of shortest paths also produced lower node
centrality, lower edge betweeness and lower edge load for (non-randomized)
protein residue networks than in their respective randomized counterparts. The
implications of these properties for protein residue networks are discussed in
terms of communication congestion and network vulnerability. The randomized
protein residue networks have lower network clustering than the
(non-randomized) protein residue networks. Hence, our findings also shed light
on a hitherto neglected aspect: the importance of high network clustering in
protein residue networks. High clustering increases navigability of a network
for local search and the combination of a local search process on a highly
clustered small-world network topology such as protein residue networks reduces
communication congestion and network vulnerability.

Ca, and Fe in solar energetic particles (SEPs) in the 2 - 15 MeV amu-1 region
measured on the Wind spacecraft during 54 large SEP events occurring between
November 1994 and June 2012. The origin of most of the temporal and spatial
variations in abundances of the heavier elements lies in rigidity-dependent
scattering during transport of the particles away from the site of acceleration
at shock waves driven out from the Sun by coronal mass ejections (CMEs).
Variation in the abundance of Fe is correlated with the Fe spectral index, as
expected from scattering theory but not previously noted. Clustering of Fe
abundances during the ""reservoir"" period, late in SEP events, is also newly
reported. Transport-induced enhancements in one region are balanced by

globular cluster (GC) populations. Of these, 248 are E galaxies, 93 are S0
galaxies, and 81 are spirals or irregulars. Among various correlations of the
total number of GCs with other global galaxy properties, we find that N_GC
correlates well though nonlinearly with the dynamical mass of the galaxy bulge
M_dyn = 4 \sigma_e^2 R_e /G, where \sigma_e is the central velocity dispersion
and R_e the effective radius of the galaxy light profile. We also present
updated versions of the GC specific frequency S_N and specific mass S_M versus
host galaxy luminosity and baryonic mass. These graphs exhibit the previously
known U-shape: highest S_N or S_M values occur for either dwarfs or
supergiants, but in the midrange of galaxy size (10^9 - 10^10 L_Sun) the GC
numbers fall along a well defined baseline value of S_N ~ 1 or S_M ~ 0.1,
similar among all galaxy types. Along with other recent discussions, we suggest
that this trend may represent the effects of feedback, which systematically
inhibited early star formation at either very low or very high galaxy mass, but
which had its minimum effect for intermediate masses. Our results strongly
reinforce recent proposals that GC formation efficiency appears to be most
nearly proportional to the galaxy halo mass M_halo. The mean ""absolute""
efficiency ratio for GC formation that we derive from the catalog data is
M_GCS/M_halo = 6 \times 10^-5. We suggest that the galaxy-to-galaxy scatter
around this mean value may arise in part because of differences in the relative
timing of GC formation versus field-star formation. Finally, we find that an
excellent empirical predictor of total GC population for galaxies of all
luminosities is N_GC \sim (R_e \sigma_e)^1.3$, a result consistent with
Fundamental Plane scaling relations.

Tevatron, which excludes the mass region from 50 to 125 GeV. The 8 TeV LHC is
not yet sensitive to the observation of the color-singlet states, which are
produced at rates much smaller than the octets. Nevertheless, the color-singlet
pseudoscalar can be discovered at the 14 TeV LHC by analyzing the channel where
it is produced from the decay of a color-octet vector boson.

a critical thickness at which an unusual ferroelectric-\'\' polar
non-ferroelectric\rq\rq phase transition occurs in asymmetric ferroelectric
tunnel junctions. In the \'\' polar non-ferroelectric\rq\rq phase, there is
only one non-switchable polarization which is caused by the competition between
the depolarizing field and the built-in field, and closure-like domains are
proposed to form to minimize the system energy. The transition temperature is
found to decrease monotonically as the ferroelectric barrier thickness is
decreased and the reduction becomes more significant for the thinner
ferroelectric layers. As a matter of fact, the built-in electric field does not
only result in smearing of phase transition but also forces the transition to
take place at a reduced temperature. Such findings may impose a fundamental
limit on the work temperature and thus should be further taken into account in
the future ferroelectric tunnel junction-type or ferroelectric capacitor-type
devices.

technique that provides valuable structural information for biological
macromolecules under physiological conditions and with no limitation on the
molecular size. In order to refine molecular structure against experimental SAS
data, ab initio prediction of the scattering profile must be recomputed
hundreds of thousands of times, which involves the computation of the sinc
kernel over all pairs of atoms in a molecule. The quadratic computational
complexity of predicting the SAS profile limits the size of the molecules and
and has been a major impediment for integration of SAS data into structure
refinement protocols. In order to significantly speed up prediction of the SAS
profile we present a general purpose graphical processing unit (GPU) algorithm,
written in OpenCL, for the summation of the sinc kernel (Debye summation) over
all pairs of atoms. This program is an order of magnitude faster than a
parallel CPU algorithm, and faster than an FMM-like approximation method for
certain input domains. We show that our algorithm is currently the fastest
method for performing SAS computation for small and medium size molecules
(around 50000 atoms or less). This algorithm is critical for quick and accurate
SAS profile computation of elongated structures, such as DNA, RNA, and sparsely
spaced pseudo-atom molecules.

(2) an Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) somewhat like the COBE FIRAS

new science (beyond the obvious target of B-modes from gravity waves generated
during inflation) made possible by these two instruments working in tandem
include: (1) the ultimate galaxy cluster survey gathering 10e6 clusters
extending to large redshift and measuring their peculiar velocities and
temperatures (through the kSZ effect and relativistic corrections to the
classic y-distortion spectrum, respectively) (2) a detailed investigation into
the nature of the cosmic infrared background (CIB) consisting of at present
unresolved dusty high-z galaxies, where most of the star formation in the
universe took place, (3) searching for distortions from the perfect CMB
blackbody spectrum, which will probe a large number of otherwise inaccessible
effects (e.g., energy release through decaying dark matter, the primordial
power spectrum on very small scales where measurements today are impossible due
to erasure from Silk damping and contamination from non-linear cascading of

to magnetars, by (ii) opening of a fraction of the magnetosphere during bursts

crustal magnetic fields, leads beyond some twist limit to explosive instability

Very Large Array (VLA), new observations can test the assumptions upon which
ejecta mass estimates are based. Early observations of the classical nova V1723
Aql showed an unexpectedly rapid rise in radio flux density and a distinct bump
in the radio light curve on the rise to radio maximum, which is inconsistent
with the simple model of spherical ejecta expelled in a single discrete event.
This initial bump appears to indicate the presence of shocked material in the
outer region of the ejected shell, with the emission from the shocks fading
over time. We explore possible origins for this emission and its relation to
the mass loss history of the nova. The evolution of the radio spectrum also
reveals the density profile, the mass of the ejected shell, and other
properties of the ejecta. These observations comprise one of the most complete,
longterm set of multi-wavelength radio observations for any classical nova to
date.

driven by the magneto-rotational instability. By modeling the ionization and
conductivity in the disk around proto-Jupiter, we find that turbulence is
possible if the X-rays emitted near the Sun reach the planet's vicinity and
either (1) the gas surface densities are in the range of the minimum-mass
models constructed by augmenting Jupiter's satellites to Solar composition,
while dust is depleted from the disk atmosphere, or (2) the surface densities
are much less, and in the range of gas-starved models fed with material from
the Solar nebula, but not so low that ambipolar diffusion decouples the neutral
gas from the plasma. The results lend support to both minimum-mass and
gas-starved models of the protojovian disk: (1) The dusty minimum-mass models
have internal conductivities low enough to prevent angular momentum transfer by
magnetic forces, as required for the material to remain in place while the
satellites form. (2) The gas-starved models have magnetically-active surface
layers and a decoupled interior ""dead zone"". Similar active layers in the Solar
nebula yield accretion stresses in the range assumed in constructing the
circumjovian gas-starved models. Our results also point to aspects of both
classes of models that can be further developed. Non-turbulent minimum-mass
models will lose dust from their atmospheres by settling, enabling gas to
accrete through a thin surface layer. For the gas-starved models it is crucial
to learn whether enough stellar X-ray and ultraviolet photons reach the
circumjovian disk. Additionally the stress-to-pressure ratio ought to increase
with distance from the planet, likely leading to episodic accretion outbursts.

individual qubits which are all coupled to the same 3D cavity fields. The
challenge in controlling this system comes from spectral crowding, where
leakage transition of qubits are close to computational transitions in other.
Here it is shown that fast pulses are possible which address single qubits

only gives marginal improvements over the conventional Gaussian pulse shape. On
the other hand, a first order result using the Magnus expansion gives a fast
analytical pulse shape which gives a high fidelity gate for a specific gate

corroborates these results and yields to even faster gates, showing that

spread implied by the luminosity dispersion seen in colour magnitude diagrams.
Evidence for weak lithium depletion (< 10 per cent in equivalent width) that is

unpolarized and polarized scattering data is believed to be a consequence of
two-photon exchange (TPE) effects. However, the calculations of TPE corrections
have significant model dependence, and there is limited direct experimental
evidence for such corrections. We present the results of a new experimental
technique for making direct $e^\pm p$ comparisons, which has the potential to
make precise measurements over a broad range in $Q^2$ and scattering angles. We
use the Jefferson Lab electron beam and the Hall B photon tagger to generate a
clean but untagged photon beam. The photon beam impinges on a converter foil to
generate a mixed beam of electrons, positrons, and photons. A chicane is used
to separate and recombine the electron and positron beams while the photon beam
is stopped by a photon blocker. This provides a combined electron and positron
beam, with energies from 0.5 to 3.2 GeV, which impinges on a liquid hydrogen
target. The large acceptance CLAS detector is used to identify and reconstruct
elastic scattering events, determining both the initial lepton energy and the
sign of the scattered lepton. The data were collected in two days with a
primary electron beam energy of only 3.3 GeV, limiting the data from this run
to smaller values of $Q^2$ and scattering angle. Nonetheless, this measurement
yields a data sample for $e^\pm p$ with statistics comparable to those of the
best previous measurements. We have shown that we can cleanly identify elastic
scattering events and correct for the difference in acceptance for electron and
positron scattering. The final ratio of positron to electron scattering:
$R=1.027\pm0.005\pm0.05$ for $<Q^2>=0.206$ GeV$^2$ and $0.830\leq \epsilon\leq
0.943$.

baryon masses are very small, they have important consequences. The stability
of the hydrogen atom against beta decay is a prominent example. Here we include
these effects by adding them to valence quarks in a lattice QCD calculation
based on $N_f=2+1$ simulations with 5 lattice spacings down to 0.054 fm,
lattice sizes up to 6 fm and average up-down quark masses all the way down to
their physical value. This allows us to gain control over all systematic
errors, except for the one associated with neglecting electromagnetism in the
sea. We compute the octet baryon isomultiplet mass splittings, as well as the
individual contributions from electromagnetism and the up-down quark mass
difference. Our results for the total splittings are in good agreement with
experiment.

subject to clossflow-induced shear is investigated numerically by solving the
Navier-Stokes equation. We found that in the absence of crossflow, the critical
transmembrane pressure required to force the droplet into the pore is in
excellent agreement with a theoretical prediction based on the Young-Laplace
equation. With increasing shear rate, the critical pressure of permeation
increases, and at sufficiently high shear rates the oil droplet breaks up into
two segments. The results of numerical simulations indicate that droplet
breakup at the pore entrance is facilitated at lower surface tension, higher
oil-to-water viscosity ratio and larger droplet size but is insensitive to the
value of the contact angle. Using simple force and torque balance arguments, an
estimate for the increase in critical pressure due to crossflow and the breakup
capillary number is obtained and validated for different viscosity ratios,
surface tension coefficients, contact angles, and drop-to-pore size ratios.

armchair graphene nanoribbons metallic and their zigzag counterparts
half-metallic due to charge transfer from the adatom to the {\pi} electronic

define its future large missions, advocates the need for a transformational
leap in our understanding of two key questions in astrophysics: 1) How does
ordinary matter assemble into the large scale structures that we see today? 2)
How do black holes grow and shape the Universe? Hot gas in clusters, groups and
the intergalactic medium dominates the baryonic content of the local Universe.
To understand the astrophysical processes responsible for the formation and
assembly of these large structures, it is necessary to measure their physical
properties and evolution. This requires spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy
with a factor 10 increase in both telescope throughput and spatial resolving
power compared to currently planned facilities. Feedback from supermassive
black holes is an essential ingredient in this process and in most galaxy
evolution models, but it is not well understood. X-ray observations can
uniquely reveal the mechanisms launching winds close to black holes and
determine the coupling of the energy and matter flows on larger scales. Due to
the effects of feedback, a complete understanding of galaxy evolution requires
knowledge of the obscured growth of supermassive black holes through cosmic
time, out to the redshifts where the first galaxies form. X-ray emission is the
most reliable way to reveal accreting black holes, but deep survey speed must
improve by a factor ~100 over current facilities to perform a full census into
the early Universe. The Advanced Telescope for High Energy Astrophysics
(Athena+) mission provides the necessary performance (e.g. angular resolution,
spectral resolution, survey grasp) to address these questions and revolutionize
our understanding of the Hot and Energetic Universe. These capabilities will
also provide a powerful observatory to be used in all areas of astrophysics.

for the great majority of microlensing planets, enabling much more precise
study of the planet distributions as functions of planet and host mass,
planet-host separation, and Galactic position (particularly bulge vs. disk). In
addition, rare systems (such as planets orbiting brown dwarfs or black holes)
that are presently lost in the noise would be clearly identified. In contrast
to Kepler's current primary hunting ground of close-in planets, its
microlensing planets would be in the cool outer parts of solar systems,

radius appears to be larger than the radius observed at far-UV wavelengths,
most likely due to high temperatures in the outer atmosphere at which hydrogen
is mostly ionized. We furthermore detect the stellar companion HD 189733B in

hydrodynamical simulations that explore WDM masses of 1, 2 and 4 keV (assuming
the WDM consists of thermal relics), along with different physically motivated
thermal histories. We carefully address different sources of systematic error
that may affect our final results and perform an analysis of the Lya flux power
with conservative error estimates. By using a method that samples the
multi-dimensional astrophysical and cosmological parameter space, we obtain a
lower limit mwdm > 3.3 keV (2sigma) for warm dark matter particles in the form
of early decoupled thermal relics. Adding the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
Lya flux power spectrum does not improve this limit. Thermal relics of masses 1
keV, 2 keV and 2.5 keV are disfavoured by the data at about the 9sigma, 4sigma

is a suppression in the linear matter power spectrum at (non-linear) scales

function (IMF) in early-type galaxies becomes increasingly `bottom-heavy' with
increasing galaxy mass and/or velocity dispersion, sigma. Here we consider
evidence for IMF variation in a sample of relatively compact early-type
galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. These galaxies are of
sufficiently high stellar density that a dark halo likely makes a minor
contribution to the total dynamical mass, Mdyn, within one effective radius. We
fit our detailed stellar population synthesis models to the stacked absorption
line spectra of these galaxies in bins of sigma and find evidence from
IMF-sensitive spectral features for a bottom-heavy IMF at high sigma. We also
apply simple `mass-follows-light' dynamical models to the same data and find
that Mdyn is significantly higher than what would be expected if these galaxies
were stellar dominated and had a universal Milky Way IMF. Adopting Mdyn M_*
therefore implies that the IMF is `heavier' at high sigma. Most importantly,
the quantitative amount of inferred IMF variation is very similar between the
two techniques, agreeing to within 0.1 dex in mass. The agreement between two
independent techniques, when applied to the same data, provides compelling
evidence for systematic variation in the IMF as a function of early-type galaxy
velocity dispersion. Any alternative explanations must reproduce both the
results from dynamical and stellar population-based techniques.

conclusively revealed the nature of ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) at the

of particular interest because the luminosity requires either super-Eddington
accretion onto a black hole of mass ~10 Msun, or more standard accretion onto
an intermediate-mass black hole. Super-Eddington accretion models predict
strong outflowing winds, making atomic absorption lines a key diagnostic of the
nature of extreme ULXs. To search for such features, we have undertaken a long,
500 ks observing campaign on Holmberg IX X-1 with Suzaku. This is the most
sensitive dataset in the iron K bandpass for a bright, isolated ULX to date,
yet we find no statistically significant atomic features in either emission or
absorption; any undetected narrow features must have equivalent widths less
than 15-20 eV at 99% confidence. These limits are far below the >150 eV lines
expected if observed trends between mass inflow and outflow rates extend into
the super-Eddington regime, and in fact rule out the line strengths observed
from disk winds in a variety of sub-Eddington black holes. We therefore cannot
be viewing the central regions of Holmberg IX X-1 through any substantial
column of material, ruling out models of spherical super-Eddington accretion.
If Holmberg IX X-1 is a super-Eddington source, any associated outflow must
have an anisotropic geometry. Finally, the lack of iron emission suggests that
the stellar companion cannot be launching a strong wind, and that Holmberg IX

structures, and more specifically of galaxy groups and clusters, will still be
open in the coming decade and beyond: what is the interplay of galaxy,
supermassive black hole, and intergalactic gas evolution in the most massive
objects in the Universe - galaxy groups and clusters? What are the processes
driving the evolution of chemical enrichment of the hot diffuse gas in
large-scale structures? How and when did the first galaxy groups in the
Universe, massive enough to bind more than 10^7 K gas, form? Focussing on the
period when groups and clusters assembled (0.5<z<2.5), we show that, due to the
continuum and line emission of this hot intergalactic gas at X-ray wavelengths,
Athena+, combining high sensitivity with excellent spectral and spatial
resolution, will deliver breakthrough observations in view of the
aforementioned issues. Indeed, the physical and chemical properties of the hot
intra-cluster gas, and their evolution across time, are a key to understand the
co-evolution of galaxy and supermassive black hole within their environments.

been shown that the dominant spin effects can be modeled by a \emph{single}

waveform models. Previous studies indicate that these models should be adequate
for gravitational-wave detection. In this paper we focus on the systematic
biases that would result from using them to estimate binary parameters, and
consider a one-parameter family of configurations at one choice of mass ratio
and effective single spin. We find that for low-mass binaries within that
family of configurations, where the observable waveform is dominated by the
inspiral, the systematic bias in all physical parameters is smaller than the
parameter uncertainty due to degeneracies between the mass ratio and the spins,
at least up to signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of 50. For higher-mass binaries,
where the merger and ringdown make a greater contribution to the observed
signal, the bias in the mass ratio is comparable to its uncertainty at SNRs of
only $\sim$30, and the bias in the measurement of the total spin is
\emph{larger} than the uncertainty defined by the 90% confidence region even at

better choice of single-effective-spin parameter, these results suggest that it

turbulence in the interstellar medium (ISM). Although turbulence is widely
believed to be driven by star formation (SF), recent studies have shown that
this driving mechanism may not be dominant in regions of low SF rate surface
density (SFRSD), such as found in dwarf galaxies or the outer regions of
spirals. We have generated average HI line profiles in a number of nearby
dwarfs and low-mass spirals by co-adding HI spectra in regions with either a
common radius or SFRSD. We find that the spatially-resolved superprofiles are
composed of a central narrow peak (5-15 km/s) with higher velocity wings to
either side. With the assumption that the central peak reflects the turbulent
velocity dispersion, we compare HI kinematics to local ISM properties,
including surface mass densities and measures of SF. The HI velocity dispersion
is correlated most strongly with surface mass density, which points at a
gravitational origin for turbulence, but it is unclear which instabilities can
operate efficiently in these systems. SF energy is produced at a level
sufficient to drive HI turbulent motions where SFRSD > 10^-4 Msun yr^-1 kpc^-2.
At low SF intensities, SF does not supply enough energy for turbulence, nor
does it uniquely determine the velocity dispersion. Nevertheless, SF appears to
provide a lower threshold for HI velocity dispersions. We find that coupling
efficiency decreases with increasing SFRSD, consistent with a picture where SF
couples to the ISM with constant efficiency, but that less of that energy is
found in HI at higher SFRSD. We examine a number of potential drivers of HI
turbulence, including SF, gravitational instabilities, the magnetorotational
instability, and accretion, and find that no single mechanism can drive the
observed levels of turbulence at low SFRSD. We discuss possible solutions to
this conundrum.

changing blocking fraction, changes to the inner disk hole size, as well as
changes to the accretion rate. Overall, we find that the Class I:Class II ratio

neutral in the dense PDR where the radiation field is relatively soft, but
ionized in the diffuse ISM/PDR. By contrast, the PAH size distribution appears
to be independent of local ionization state. Important to unresolved studies of
extragalactic low-metallicity star-forming regions, we find that emission from

declining Type Ic supernova, SN 2005ek. Reaching a peak magnitude of M_R =
-17.3 and decaying by ~3 mag in the first 15 days post-maximum, SN 2005ek is
among the fastest Type I supernovae observed to date. The spectra of SN 2005ek
closely resemble those of normal SN Ic, but with an accelerated evolution.
There is evidence for the onset of nebular features at only nine days
post-maximum. Spectroscopic modeling reveals an ejecta mass of ~0.3 Msun that
is dominated by oxygen (~80%), while the pseudo-bolometric light curve is
consistent with an explosion powered by ~0.03 Msun of radioactive Ni-56.
Although previous rapidly evolving events (e.g., SN 1885A, SN 1939B, SN 2002bj,
SN 2010X) were hypothesized to be produced by the detonation of a helium shell
on a white dwarf, oxygen-dominated ejecta are difficult to reconcile with this
proposed mechanism. We find that the properties of SN 2005ek are consistent
with either the edge-lit double detonation of a low-mass white dwarf or the
iron-core collapse of a massive star, stripped by binary interaction. However,
if we assume that the strong spectroscopic similarity of SN 2005ek to other SN
Ic is an indication of a similar progenitor channel, then a white-dwarf
progenitor becomes very improbable. SN 2005ek may be one of the lowest mass
stripped-envelope core-collapse explosions ever observed. We find that the rate
of such rapidly declining Type I events is at least 1-3% of the normal SN Ia
rate.

the warm interstellar medium (WIM) of 32 nearby early-type galaxies (ETGs). We
propose a tentative subdivision of our sample ETGs into two groups, according
to their Ha equivalent width (EW) and Lyman continuum (LyC) photon escape
fraction (PLF). Type i ETGs show nearly constant EWs and a PLF~0, suggesting
that photoionization by post-AGB stars is the main driver of their faint
extranuclear nebular emission. Type ii ETGs are characterized by very low,
outwardly increasing EWs, and a PLF as large as ~0.9 in their centers. Such
properties point to a low, and inwardly decreasing WIM density and/or volume
filling factor. We argue that, because of extensive LyC photon leakage,
emission-line luminosities and EWs are reduced in type ii ETG nuclei by at
least one order of magnitude. Consequently, the line weakness of these ETGs is
by itself no compelling evidence for their containing merely ""weak""
(sub-Eddington accreting) active galactic nuclei (AGN). In fact, LyC photon
escape, which has heretofore not been considered, may constitute a key element
in understanding why many ETGs with prominent signatures of AGN activity in
radio continuum and/or X-ray wavelengths show only faint emission lines and
weak signatures of AGN activity in their optical spectra. The LyC photon
escape, in conjunction with dilution of nuclear EWs by line-of-sight
integration through a triaxial stellar host, can systematically impede
detection of AGN in gas-poor galaxy spheroids through optical emission-line
spectroscopy. We further find that type i and ii ETGs differ little (~0.4 dex)
in their mean BPT line ratios, which in both cases are characteristic of
LINERs. This potentially hints at a degeneracy of the projected,
luminosity-weighted BPT ratios for the specific 3D properties of the WIM in
ETGs. (abridged)

inversion of line ratios into desired physical properties. These tools
generally come in form of diagnostic ratios/diagrams that are based on grids of
photoionisation models. An important input to the photoionisation models is the
stellar atmosphere spectrum of the ionising sources. The current omission of
shocks in the calculation of the former set of models could threaten the
accuracy of the physical interpretation of emission line ratios from Hii
regions. Current stellar atmosphere models that are crucial inputs to the grid
of photoionisation models used to generate nebular emission line diagnostic
diagrams might produce significant biases due to the omission of shocks. We
investigate whether a new generation of photoionisation model grids, taking
shocks into account, is required to compensate for the biases. We make use of
the WM-Basic stellar atmosphere code, which can account for the extra energetic
emission in the stellar spectral energy distribution produced by shocks, in
conjunction with the photoionisation code MOCASSIN to determine whether shocks
produce significant biases in the determination of the physical parameters of
the interstellar medium and/or ionising stellar parameters. We conclude that
these effects are only important for stellar sources with effective
temperatures lower than 30kK and in this case they yield artificially high
stellar temperatures, electron temperatures and nebular ionisation parameters.
The magnitude of the effect is also obviously dependent on the strength of the
shock and is likely to be unimportant for the majority of stellar sources.
Nevertheless, we find our 20kK and 30kK shock models to strongly enhance the He
ii 4686 nebular emission line. This result is however not strong enough to
explain previously observed He ii 4686 line emission in the spectra of Hii

though this is in tension with xenon-based experiments and PICASSO. The tension
with the null results from XENON100 and XENON10 is approximately the same as
for the spin-independent coupling. All three experimental signals can be made
compatible through a combination of spin-dependent interactions with both the
proton and neutron, although such a scenario increases the conflict with the
null results of other experiments.

Computing transverse momentum spectra for identified particles using
Boltzmann-type distributions and relating different associated multiplicities

problem of evanescent wave transfer at an interface between a normal medium of
n=1 and an ideal negative index medium of n=-1 neglects the non-zero induced
surface current and charge densities at the interface and is self-inconsistent.
We re-solve the electromagnetic boundary problem by taking into account the
non-zero induced surface current and charge densities that have been neglected
so far by others. We give the exact induced surface current and charge
distributions for this special case and solve the refracted and reflected
fields analytically using Green's function method. The self-consistent solution
yields a transmission coefficient of 1 and reflection coefficient of 0 for all
evanescent waves. Accordingly, we found that, on the contrary to the popular

Bose-Fermi Anderson and Kondo quantum impurity models. These models describe a
localized level coupled both to a fermionic bath having a density of states
that vanishes like |\epsilon|^r at the Fermi energy (\epsilon=0) and, via one
component of the impurity spin, to a bosonic bath having a sub-Ohmic spectral
density proportional to |\omega|^s. Each bath is capable by itself of
suppressing the Kondo effect at a continuous quantum phase transition. We study
the interplay between these two mechanisms for Kondo destruction using
continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo for the pseudogap Bose-Fermi Anderson model
with 0<r<1/2 and 1/2<s<1, and applying the numerical renormalization-group to
the corresponding Kondo model. At particle-hole symmetry, the models exhibit a
quantum critical point between a Kondo (fermionic strong-coupling) phase and a
localized (Kondo-destroyed) phase. The two solution methods, which are in good
agreement in their domain of overlap, provide access to the many-body spectrum,
as well as to correlation functions including, in particular, the
single-particle Green's function and the static and dynamical local spin
susceptibilities. The quantum-critical regime exhibits the hyperscaling of
critical exponents and \omega/T scaling in the dynamics that characterize an
interacting critical point. The (r,s) plane can be divided into three regions:
one each in which the calculated critical properties are dominated by the
bosonic bath alone or by the fermionic bath alone, and between these two
regions, a third in which the bosonic bath governs the critical spin response
but both baths influence the renormalization-group flow near the quantum
critical point.

suppressed by two spatially varying effects: negative feedback provided by the

several different clients from a single access point over unreliable wireless

This problem involves two characteristics. On the streaming side, different
video streams may generate variable-bit-rate traffic with different traffic
patterns. On the network side, the wireless transmissions are unreliable, and
the link qualities differ from client to client. In order to alleviate the
above stochastic aspects of both video streams and link unreliability, each
client typically buffers incoming packets before playing the video. The quality
of the video playback subscribed to by each flow depends, among other factors,
on both the delay of packets as well as their throughput.
  In this paper we characterize precisely the capacity of the wireless video
server in terms of what combination of joint per-packet-delays and throughputs
can be supported for the set of flows, as a function of the buffering delay
introduced at the server.
  We also address how to schedule packets at the access point to satisfy the
joint per-packet-delay-throughput performance measure. We test the designed
policy on the traces of three movies. From our tests, it appears to outperform

model trajectory through Bayesian updating of a prior process conditional on
model information. A one-step-ahead sampling scheme for interrogating the model
is described, its consistency and first order convergence properties are
proved, and its computational complexity is shown to be proportional to that of
numerical explicit one-step solvers. Examples illustrate the flexibility of
this framework to deal with a wide variety of complex and large-scale systems.
Within the calibration problem, discretization uncertainty defines a layer in
the Bayesian hierarchy, and a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that targets
this posterior distribution is presented. This formalism is used for inference
on the JAK-STAT delay differential equation model of protein dynamics from
indirectly observed measurements. The discussion outlines implications for the
new field of probabilistic numerics.

understand the flow of vehicular traffic on freeways; analytically tractable
models of flow on an urban grid, however, have not been as extensively
explored. In an ideal world, traffic signals would be timed such that
consecutive lights turned green just as vehicles arrived, eliminating the need
to stop at each block. Unfortunately, this ""green wave"" scenario is generally
unworkable due to frustration imposed by competing demands of traffic moving in
different directions. Until now this has typically been resolved by numerical
simulation and optimization. Here, we develop a theory for the flow in an
idealized system consisting of a long two-way road with periodic intersections.
We show that optimal signal timing can be understood analytically and that
there are counter-intuitive asymmetric solutions to this signal coordination
problem. We further explore how these theoretical solutions degrade as traffic

another approach based on the Time Transfer Functions (TTF) has demonstrated
its capability to give access to key quantities such as the time of flight of a
light signal between two point-events and the tangent vector to its
null-geodesic in a weak gravitational field using an integral-based method. The
availability of several models, formulated in different and independent ways,
must not be considered like an oversized relativistic toolbox. Quite the
contrary, they are needed as validation to put future experimental results on
solid ground. The objective of this work is then twofold. First, we build the
time of flight and tangent vectors in a closed form within the TTF formalism
giving the case of a time dependent metric. Second, we show how to use this new
approach to obtain a comparison of the TTF with two existing modelings, namely
GREM and RAMOD. In this way, we evidentiate the mutual consistency of the three
models, opening the basis for further links between all the approaches, which
is mandatory for the interpretation of future space missions data. This will be
illustrated through two recognized cases: a static gravitational field and a

transfer, accompanied by break-up of the deuteron into a proton and neutron.
The large $-t$ involved allows one of the nucleons to be identified as struck,
and the other as a spectator to the $\gamma N\rightarrow VN$ subprocess.
Corrections to the plane wave impulse approximation involve final state
interactions (FSIs) between the struck nucleon or the vector meson, either of
which is energetic, with the slow spectator nucleon. In this regime, the
eikonal approximation is valid, so is employed to calculate the cross-section
for the reaction. Due to the high-energy nature of the FSIs, the maxima of the
rescatterings are located at nearly transverse directions of the fast hadrons.
This results in two peaks in the angular distribution of the spectator nucleon,
each corresponding to either the $V$-$N$ or the $p$-$n$ rescattering. The
$V$-$N$ peak provides a new means of probing the $V$-$N$ interaction. This is
checked for near-threshold $\phi$ and $J/\Psi$ photoproduction reactions which
demonstrate that the $V$-$N$ peak can be used to extract the largely unknown
amplitudes of $\phi$-$N$ and $J/\Psi$-$N$ interactions.
  Two additional phenomena are observed when extending the calculation of
$J/\Psi$ photoproduction to the sub-threshold and high-energy domains. In the
first case we observe overall suppression of FSI effects due to a restricted
phase space for sub-threshold production in the rescattering amplitude. In the
second, we observe cancellation of the $V$-$N$ rescattering amplitudes for
vector mesons produced off of different nucleons in the deuteron.

10^5 times tighter than the current constraints on the trispectrum parameter
gnl, which means that the allowed numerical values of the second and third
order terms in the perturbative expansion of the curvature perturbation are
comparable. We show that a consequence of this is that if gnl is large enough
to be detectable, then it will induce a large variation between the observable
value of fnl and its value in a larger inflated volume. Even if there were only
a few extra efoldings between the beginning of inflation and horizon crossing
of our Hubble horizon, an observably large gnl means that fnl is unlikely to be
as small as its current constraint, regardless of its true background value.
This result is very general, it holds regardless of how many fields contributed
to the curvature perturbation. We also generalise this result to other shapes
of non-Gaussianity, beyond the local model. We show that the variance of the

multi-transitional modelling of class II methanol maser sources. We have
investigated the properties of the OH and other classII methanol transitions

introduce a weaker condition, called $q$-purity, than purity of the channel. To
study $q$-pure channels, we concentrate ourselves to quasi q.q.o. acting on
$M_2(C)$. We describe all trace-preserving quasi q.q.o. on $M_2(C)$, which
allowed us to prove that if a trace-preserving symmetric quasi q.q.o. such that

positivity. If a symmetric quasi q.q.o. has a Haar state $\tau$, then its
corresponding quadratic operator is nonlinear, and it is proved that such

quantum nonlinear channels. Moreover, it is also considered that nonlinear

[1] to a 1D biased diffusion model for linear DNA translocation and a new
analysis will be given to the data in [1]. It was pointed out [2] by us
recently that this 1D linear translocation model is equivalent to the one that
was considered by Schrodinger [3] for the Enrenhaft-Millikan measurements [4,5]
on electron charge. Here we apply Schrodinger's first-passage-time distribution
formula to the data set in [1]. It is found that Schrodinger's formula can be
used to describe the time distribution of DNA translocation in solid-state
nanopores. These fittings yield two useful parameters: drift velocity of DNA
translocation and diffusion constant of DNA inside the nanopore. The results
suggest two regimes of DNA translocation: (I) at low voltages, there are clear
deviations from Smoluchowski's linear law of electrophoresis [6] which we
attribute to the entropic barrier effects; (II) at high voltages, the
translocation velocity is a linear function of the applied electric field. In
regime II, the apparent diffusion constant exhibits a quadratic dependence on
applied electric field, suggesting a mechanism of Taylor dispersion effect
likely due the electro-osmotic flow field in the nanopore channel. This
analysis yields a dispersion-free diffusion constant value for the segment of
DNA inside the nanopore which is in agreement with Stokes-Einstein theory
quantitatively. The implication of Schrodinger's formula for DNA sequencing is
discussed.

geostrophy, baroclinic instabilities, and jets in the strongly rotating regime
(the ""extratropics"") and the role of the Hadley circulation, wave adjustment of
the thermal structure, and the tendency toward equatorial superrotation in the
slowly rotating regime (the ""tropics""). We then survey key elements of the
hydrological cycle, including the factors that control precipitation, humidity,
and cloudiness. Next, we summarize key mechanisms by which the circulation
affects the global-mean climate, and hence planetary habitability. In

atmospheric collapse, and the links between atmospheric circulation and CO2

primarily by star formation (SF), but the timescale for converting SF energy to
HI kinetic energy is unclear. As a complication, studies on the connection
between Hi line widths and SF in external galaxies often use broadband tracers
for the SF rate, which must implicitly assume that SF histories (SFHs) have
been constant over the timescale of the tracer. In this paper, we compare
measures of HI energy to time-resolved SFHs in a number of nearby dwarf
galaxies. We find that HI energy surface density is strongly correlated only
with SF that occurred 30-40 Myr ago. This timescale corresponds to the
approximate lifetime of the lowest mass supernova progenitors (~ 8 Msun). This
analysis suggests that the coupling between SF and the neutral ISM is strongest
on this timescale, due either to an intrinsic delay between the release of the
peak energy from SF or to the coherent effects of many SNe during this
interval. At \Sigma_SFR > 10^-3 Msun yr^-1 kpc^-2, we find a mean coupling
efficiency between SF energy and HI energy of \epsilon = 0.11 +/- 0.04 using
the 30-40 Myr timescale. However, unphysical efficiencies are required in lower
\Sigma_SFR systems, implying that SF is not the primary driver of HI kinematics
at \Sigma_SFR < 10^-3 Msun yr^-1 kpc^-2.

Relative observability is stronger than observability, but enjoys the important

is weaker than normality, and thus yields, when combined with controllability,
a generally larger controlled behavior; in particular, no constraint is imposed

spectroscopic Halpha measurements and apply dust corrections derived from
Balmer decrements. We find a dependence of SSFR on stellar mass, such that
SSFRs decrease with increasing stellar mass for star-forming galaxies, and for
the full sample, SSFRs decrease as a stronger function of stellar mass. We use
simple parametrizations of exponentially declining star formation histories to
investigate the dependence on stellar mass of the star formation timescale and
the formation redshift. We find that parametrizations previously fit to samples
of z~1 galaxies cannot recover the distributions of SSFRs and stellar masses
observed in the GAMA sample between 0.05<z<0.32. In particular, a large number
of low-mass (M* < 10^10 Msun) galaxies are observed to have much higher SSFRs
than can be explained by these simple models over the redshift range of
0.05<z<0.32, even when invoking mass-dependent staged evolution. For such a
large number of galaxies to maintain low stellar masses, yet harbour such high
SSFRs, requires the late onset of a weak underlying exponentially declining SFH

that has lately been investigated by different groups but the conclusions have
been surprisingly contradictory. While some studies have found a good overall
agreement between the nuclear PDFs and the neutrino data, others have claimed
for an incompatibility. Here, we demonstrate that the independent neutrino data
sets from NuTeV, CHORUS and CDHSW collaborations differ in the absolute overall
normalization and that it is not possible to accurately reproduce all the data
simultaneously with a single set of PDFs. Our strategy to overcome this
difficulty and allow a consistent use of all neutrino data in global PDF
analyses is to normalize the data by the integrated cross-sections thereby
cancelling possible inaccuracies in the absolute normalization. Indeed, this
brings all data to a surprisingly good mutual agreement underscoring the
x-dependence of the nuclear modifications in a model-independent way. The
consistency of these data with the present nuclear PDFs is verified by
introducing a method to test the effect of a new data set in an existing global
fit that performed a Hessian error analysis.

photon trajectories from any on off kinetic scheme (KS): the process emitting
photons with a rate {\gamma}on when it is in the on state, and emitting with a
rate {\gamma}off when it is in the off state. We develop a filter that removes
the noise resulting in clean data also in cases where binning fails. The filter
is a numerical algorithm with various new statistical treatments. It is based
on a new general likelihood function developed here, with observable dependent
form. The filter can solve the noise, in the detectable region of the rate
space: that is, we also find a region where the data is ""too"" noisy.
Consistency tests will find the region's type from the data. If the data is
ruled ""too noisy"", binning obviously fails, and one should apply simpler
methods on the raw data and realizing that the extracted information is

erroneous rates. This filter (with minor adjustments) can solve the noise in
any discrete state trajectories, yet extensions are needed in ""tackling"" the
noise from other data, e.g. continuous data and FRET data.

the two species can be well distinguished using simple leaf morphometric
parameters. A lower genetic diversity in Q. alnifolia than in Q. coccifera and
a high interspecific differentiation between the two species are supported by
an analysis of nuclear and chloroplast microsatellites. The intermediacy of the

Analysis of progeny arrays provides evidence that interspecific crossings are
rare. This finding is further supported by limited introgression of chloroplast
genomes. Reproductive barriers (e.g. asynchronous phenology, post-zygotic
incompatibilities) might account for this result. A directionality of
interspecific gene flow is indicated by a genetic assignment analysis of
effective pollen clouds with Q. alnifolia acting as pollen donor. Differences
in flowering phenology and species distribution in the stand may have
influenced the direction of gene flow and the genetic differentiation among

in the formation of self-assembled lamella structures made up of Ti-rich and
V-rich layers stacked alternately with 30-50 nm wavelengths. A metal-insulator
transition is not observed in quenched solid solutions with intermediate

application of the congruent transformation requires efficient implementation
of the many-particle operators. In this work, we present the resolution of
identity congruent transformed Hamiltonian (RI-CTH) method to handle
many-particle operators. The resolution of identity was used to project the
explicitly correlated operator in a N-particle finite basis to avoid explicit
computation of the many-particle operators. Single-particle states were
obtained by performing Hartee-Fock calculations, which were then used for
construction of many-particle states. The limitation of the finite nature of
the resolution of identity was addressed by developing partial infinite order
(PIOS) diagrammatic summation technique. In the PIOS method, the matrix
elements of the projected congruent transformed Hamiltonian was expressed in
terms of diagrammatic notation and a subset of diagrams were summed up to
infinite order. The RI-CTH and RI-CTH-PIOS methods were applied to
isoelectronic series of 10-electron systems (Ne,HF,H2O,NH3,CH4) and results

the {112}/<111> channels the lowest thermal conductance with a ratio of about

The thermal conductance of different transport orientations in the {100} and

invariant under different temperatures and layer thicknesses. We show that this
behavior originates from the differences in the phonon group velocities,

Chloroplast DNA microsatellites were used for a spatial analysis of genetic

limited genetic introgression between Q. alnifolia and Q. coccifera in Cyprus.

region (AR) NOAA 11158 on 2011 February 13. AR 11158, which consisted of two
major emerging bipoles, showed prominent activities including one X- and
several M-class flares. In order to investigate the magnetic structures related
to the M6.6 event, particularly the formation process of a flare-triggering
magnetic region, we analyzed multiple spacecraft observations and numerical
results of a flare simulation. We observed that, in the center of this
quadrupolar AR, a highly sheared polarity inversion line (PIL) was formed
through proper motions of the major magnetic elements, which built a sheared
coronal arcade lying over the PIL. The observations lend support to the
interpretation that the target flare was triggered by a localized magnetic
region that had an intrusive structure, namely a positive polarity penetrating
into a negative counterpart. The geometrical relationship between the sheared
coronal arcade and the triggering region was consistent with the theoretical
flare model based on the previous numerical study. We found that the formation
of the trigger region was due to a continuous accumulation of the small-scale
magnetic patches. A few hours before the flare occurrence, the series of
emerged/advected patches reconnected with a preexisting fields. Finally, the
abrupt flare eruption of the M6.6 event started around 17:30 UT. Our analysis
suggests that, in a triggering process of a flare activity, all magnetic
systems of multiple scales, not only the entire AR evolution but also the fine
magnetic elements, are altogether involved.

light variations in the ultraviolet are hardly detectable. We detect the
variability of many ultraviolet lines of carbon, silicon, and aluminium and
discuss the origin of these lines and the nature of their variations. The
maximum abundances of helium and silicon are not high enough to cause
significant light variations. The detected variability of many ultraviolet
lines is most likely of atmospheric origin and reflects the inhomogeneous
elemental surface distribution. The variability of the Civ resonance lines is
stronger and it probably results from the dependence of the wind mass-loss rate

  A \emph{contagious set} is a set whose activation results with the entire
graph being active. Given a graph $G$, let $m(G,r)$ be the minimal size of a
contagious set. Computing $m(G,r)$ is NP-hard.
  It is known that for every $d$-regular or nearly $d$-regular graph on $n$
vertices, $m(G,r) \le O(\frac{nr}{d})$. We consider such graphs that
additionally have expansion properties, parameterized by the spectral gap
and/or the girth of the graphs.
  The general flavor of our results is that sufficiently strong expansion
(e.g., $\lambda(G)=O(\sqrt{d})$, or girth $\Omega(\log \log d)$) implies that
$m(G,2) \le O(\frac{n}{d^2})$ (and more generally, $m(G,r) \le
O(\frac{n}{d^{r/(r-1)}})$). Significantly weaker expansion properties suffice

show this for graphs of girth at least~7, and for graphs with
$\lambda(G)<(1-\epsilon)d$, provided the graph has no 4-cycles. Nearly
$d$-regular expander graphs can be obtained by considering the binomial random
graph $G(n,p)$ with $p \simeq \frac{d}{n}$ and $d > \log n$. For such graphs we
prove that $\Omega(\frac{n}{d^2 \log d}) \le m(G,2) \le O(\frac{n\log\log

differential models of crowd dynamics is established for an increasing number
$N$ of pedestrians. The novelty is the fact of considering massive agents,
namely particles whose individual mass does not become infinitesimal when $N$
grows. This implies that the total mass of the system is not constant but grows
with $N$. The main result is that the two types of models approach one another
in the limit $N\to\infty$, provided the strength and/or the domain of
pedestrian interactions are properly modulated by $N$ at either scale. This is
consistent with the idea that pedestrians may adapt their interpersonal
attitudes according to the overall level of congestion.

count rate is a strong diagnostic of the emission processes and emission
geometry around accreting compact objects. Here we present the results from a
study using a new, and simple, method designed to improve sensitivity to the
measurement of the variability of {\Gamma} on very short time-scales.
  We have measured {\Gamma} in ~2 million spectra, extracted from observations
with a variety of different accretion rates and spectral states, on time-scales
as short as 16 ms for the high mass X-ray binary Cygnus X-1, and have
cross-correlated these measurements with the source count rate. In the
soft-state cross-correlation functions (CCFs) we find a positive peak at zero
lag, stronger and narrower in the softer observations. Assuming that the X-rays
are produced by Compton scattering of soft seed photons by high energy
electrons in a corona, these results are consistent with Compton cooling of the
corona by seed photons from the inner edge of the accretion disc, the
truncation radius of which increases with increasing hardness ratio.
  The CCFs produced from the hard-state observations, however, show an
anti-correlation which is most easily explained by variation in the energy of
the electrons in the corona rather than in variation of the seed photon flux.
The hard-state CCFs can be decomposed into a narrow anti-correlation at zero
lag, which we tentatively associate with the effects of self-Comptonisation of
cyclo-synchrotron seed photons in either a hot, optically thin accretion flow
or the base of the jet, and a second, asymmetric component which we suggest is
produced as a consequence of a lag between the soft and hard X-ray emission.
The lag may be caused by a radial temperature/energy gradient in the
Comptonising electrons combined with the inward propagation of accretion rate
perturbations.

be an analog to the Fermi distribution of states in solid state physics. Real

without a phase transition. In the first counterexample a bimodal distribution
appears in an infinite system at the supercritical temperatures due to the
negative values of the surface tension coefficient. In the second
counterexample we explicitly demonstrate that a bimodal fragment distribution
appears in a finite volume analog of a gaseous phase. In contrast to the
statistical multifragmentation model, the developed statistical model
corresponds to the compressible nuclear liquid with the tricritical endpoint
located at one third of the normal nuclear density. The suggested
parameterization of the liquid phase equation of state is consistent with the
L. van Hove axioms of statistical mechanics and it does not lead to an
appearance of the non-monotonic isotherms in the macroscopic mixed phase region

Peculiarly, such a way to account for the nuclear liquid compressibility
automatically leads to an appearance of an additional state that in many
respects resembles the physical antinuclear matter.

the other, provides a promising basis for understanding the hemispherical
dichotomy of the inner core, as well as the anomalous stable layer observed at
the base of the outer core - the F-layer - which might be sustained by
continuous melting of inner core material. In this paper, we study in details
the dynamics of inner core thermal convection when dynamically induced melting
and freezing of the inner core boundary (ICB) are taken into account. If the
inner core is unstably stratified, linear stability analysis and numerical
simulations consistently show that the translation mode dominates only if the
viscosity $\eta$ is large enough, with a critical viscosity value, of order $3
10^{18}$ Pas, depending on the ability of outer core convection to supply or
remove the latent heat of melting or solidification. If $\eta$ is smaller, the
dynamical effect of melting and freezing is small. Convection takes a more
classical form, with a one-cell axisymmetric mode at the onset and chaotic
plume convection at large Rayleigh number. [...] Thermal convection requires
that a superadiabatic temperature profile is maintained in the inner core,
which depends on a competition between extraction of the inner core internal
heat by conduction and cooling at the ICB. Inner core thermal convection
appears very likely with the low thermal conductivity value proposed by Stacey
& Davis (2007), but nearly impossible with the much higher thermal conductivity
recently put forward. We argue however that the formation of an iron-rich layer
above the ICB may have a positive feedback on inner core convection: it implies
that the inner core crystallized from an increasingly iron-rich liquid,
resulting in an unstable compositional stratification which could drive inner
core convection, perhaps even if the inner core is subadiabatic.

with a generalized perturbation term appears to be a nice tool for Behavioral
Sciences (Psychology, Economics, Management, Game theory,...). More precisely,
the new perturbation term represents an index of resistance to change, defined
as a ""curved enough"" function of the quasi distance between two successive
iterates. Using this behavioral point of view, the present paper shows how such
a generalized inexact proximal algorithm can modelize the formation of habits
and routines in a striking way. This idea comes from a recent ""variational
rationality approach"" of human behavior which links a lot of different theories
of stability (habits, routines, equilibrium, traps,...) and changes (creations,
innovations, learning and destructions,...) in Behavioral Sciences and a lot of
concepts and algorithms in Variational Analysis. In this variational context,
the perturbation term represents a specific instance of the very general
concept of resistance to change, which is the disutility of some inconvenients
to change. Central to the analysis are the original variational concepts of
""worthwhile changes"" and ""marginal worthwhile stays"". At the behavioral level,
this paper advocates that proximal algorithms are well suited to modelize the
emergence of habituation/routinized human behaviors. We show when, and at which
speed, a ""worthwhile to change"" process converges to a behavioral trap.

stochastic, zero-mean fluctuations of the $\alpha$ parameter. This is based on
a minimal extension of the Kraichnan-Moffatt model, to include a background
linear shear and Galilean-invariant $\alpha$-statistics. Using the first order
smoothing approximation we derive a linear integro-differential equation for
the large-scale magnetic field, which is non perturbative in the shearing rate
$S\,$, and the $\alpha$-correlation time $\tau_\alpha\,$. The white-noise case,
$\tau_\alpha = 0\,$, is solved exactly, and it is concluded that the necessary
condition for dynamo action is identical to the Kraichnan-Moffatt model without
shear; this is because white-noise does not allow for memory effects, whereas
shear needs time to act. To explore memory effects we reduce the
integro-differential equation to a partial differential equation, valid for
slowly varying fields when $\tau_\alpha$ is small but non zero. Seeking
exponential modal solutions, we solve the modal dispersion relation and obtain
an explicit expression for the growth rate as a function of the six independent
parameters of the problem. A non zero $\tau_\alpha$ gives rise to new physical
scales, and dynamo action is completely different from the white-noise case;
e.g. even weak $\alpha$ fluctuations can give rise to a dynamo. We argue that,
at any wavenumber, both Moffatt drift and Shear always contribute to increasing
the growth rate. Two examples are presented: (a) a Moffatt drift dynamo in the
absence of shear; (b) a Shear dynamo in the absence of Moffatt drift.

present a spectroscopic study of two near-infrared selected galaxies which are
close to the characteristic stellar mass M* (~0.9x M* and ~1.3x M*) and whose
observed brightness has been boosted by the gravitational lensing effect. We
measure the redshifts of the two galaxies to be z=1.71\pm0.02 and
z=2.15\pm0.01. By fitting stellar population synthesis models to their
spectro-photometric SEDs we determine their ages to be 2.4^{+0.8}_{-0.6} Gyr

higher mass-to-light ratios than most quiescent z~2 galaxies in other studies.
We find no direct evidence for active star-formation or AGN activity in either
of the two galaxies, based on the non-detection of emission lines. Based on the
derived redshifts and stellar ages we estimate the formation redshifts to be
z=4.3^{+3.4}_{-1.2} and z=4.3^{+1.0}_{-0.6}, respectively. We use the increased
spatial resolution due to the gravitational lensing to derive constraints on
the morphology. Fitting Sersic profiles to the de-lensed images of the two
galaxies confirms their compactness, with one of them being spheroid-like, and
the other providing the first confirmation of a passive lenticular galaxy at a

an intricate pole structure and transcendentality consistent with various other

expressed in terms of the spectral properties of some linear operator which
reflects how the dynamical rules depend on the network topology. Often such
spectral features are theoretically obtained by considering only local node
properties, such as degree distributions. Many networks, however, possess
large-scale modular structures that can drastically influence their spectral
characteristics, and which are neglected in such simplified descriptions. Here
we obtain in a unified fashion the spectrum of a large family of operators,
including the adjacency, Laplacian and normalized Laplacian matrices, for
networks with generic modular structure, in the limit of large degrees. We
focus on the conditions necessary for the merging of the isolated eigenvalues
with the continuous band of the spectrum, after which the planted modular
structure can no longer be easily detected by spectral methods. This is a
crucial transition point which determines when a modular structure is strong
enough to affect a given dynamical process. We show that this transition
happens in general at different points for the different matrices, and hence
the detectability threshold can vary significantly depending on the operator
chosen. Equivalently, the sensitivity to the modular structure of the different
dynamical processes associated with each matrix will be different, given the
same large-scale structure present in the network. Furthermore, we show that,
with the exception of the Laplacian matrix, the different transitions coalesce
into the same point for the special case where the modules are homogeneous, but

variation has started again in around 2007, after some quasi-periodic V/R
variation. For the first V/R variation event, we analyze the spectroscopic
behaviors of emission lines and shell absorption lines of the Balmer series.
The V/R variations of the H_alpha through H_delta lines are characterized by
the different manner of variations of the individual emission lines in time lag
and in duration of the V/R phases. Weak correlation is also notable between the
V/R variations and other variations of the line-profile parameter such as the
peak velocities, emission line intensities and peak separations. We analyze
shell absorption lines for higher members of the Balmer series for their
central depths and radial velocities. The optical depth of the H_alpha line is
in a range of 2000 to 6000, and its long-term variation discloses different
behaviors as compared to the V/R variations. Combining the analyses of emission
and shell absorption lines, and regarding the V/R variation as wave propagation
phenomena, we find for the 1976 - 1986 event that the V/R variation is of
retrograde structure and a spiral structure is likely formed inside the disk in
the latter half of this event. The weak correlations among physical parameters
are suggestive of the disk truncated at some radius. It is noticed that
remarkable stellar brightening has occurred in the latter half of the event,
accompanying marked decrease of emission line intensities. As for the V/R
variation appeared in around 2007, which looks like a recurrence of the
previous event, we found less developed state of the disk without appreciable
time lag.

  available at http://youtu.be/5VCt2NdKFeg",,"10.1093/mnras/stt1047",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It has been suggested that long-period giant planets, such as HD 95086b and
HR 8799bcde, may have formed through gravitational instability of
protoplanetary discs. However, self-gravitating disc-satellite interaction can
lead to the formation of a gravitationally unstable gap. Such an instability
significantly affects the orbital migration of gap-opening perturbers in
massive discs. We use 2D hydrodynamical simulations to examine the role of
planet mass on the gravitational stability of gaps and its impact on orbital
migration. We consider giant planets with planet-to-star mass ratio q=0.0003 to
q=0.003, in a self-gravitating disc with disc-to-star mass ratio M_d/M_*=0.08,
aspect ratio h=0.05, and Keplerian Toomre parameter Q = 1.5 at 2.5 times the
planet's initial orbital radius. Fixed-orbit simulations show that all planet
masses we consider open gravitationally unstable gaps, but the instability is
stronger and develops sooner with increasing planet mass. The disc-on-planet
torques typically become more positive with increasing planet mass. In
freely-migrating simulations, we observe faster outward migration with
increasing planet mass, but only for planet masses capable of opening unstable
gaps early on. For q=0.0003, the planet undergoes rapid inward type III
migration before it can open a gap. For q=0.0013 we find it is possible to
balance the tendency for inward migration by the positive torques due to an
unstable gap, but only for a few 10's of orbital periods. We find the unstable
outer gap edge can trigger outward type III migration, sending the planet to
twice its initial orbital radius on dynamical timescales. This triggered type
III migration may be a way of bringing giant planets to large orbital
distances. On the other hand, our results also imply gap-opening is not a
sufficient condition for the in situ formation of giant planets on wide orbits
through disc fragmentation.

Considering these observations and using complex network theory concepts, we
managed to built and analyze a social network gathered across the classical

quantities were collected in order to classify its social network qualitatively
into real or fictional. It turns out that most of the found properties belong
to real social networks besides assortativity and giant component's size. In
order to test the network's possibilities to be real, we removed some
mythological members that could imprint a fictional aspect on the network.
Carrying on this maneuver the modified social network resulted on assortative

over April 2010 allowed for the acquisition of a dense mesh of
Ground-penetrating Radar (GPR) data with an average of 14683 points per km2
(67542 points total) on the glacier surface. The profiles were acquired using a
Mala equipment with 100 MHz antennas, towed slowly enough to record on average
every 0.3 m, a trace long enough to sound down to 189 m of ice. One profile was
repeated with 50 MHz antenna to improve electromagnetic wave propagation depth
in scattering media observed in the cirques closest to the slopes. The GPR was
coupled to a GPS system to position traces. Each profile has been manually
edited using standard GPR data processing including migration, to pick the
reflection arrival time from the ice-bedrock interface. Snow cover was
evaluated through 42 snow drilling measurements regularly spaced to cover all
the glacier. These data were acquired at the time of the GPR survey and
subsequently spatially interpolated using ordinary kriging. Using a snow
velocity of 0.22 m/ns, the snow thickness was converted to electromagnetic wave
travel-times and subtracted from the picked travel-times to the ice-bedrock
interface. The resulting travel-times were converted to ice thickness using a
velocity of 0.17 m/ns. The velocity uncertainty is discussed from a common
mid-point profile analysis. A total of 67542 georeferenced data points with
GPR-derived ice thicknesses, in addition to a glacier boundary line derived
from satellite images taken during summer, were interpolated over the entire
glacier surface using kriging with a 10 m grid size. Some uncertainty analysis
were carried on and we calculated an averaged ice thickness of 76 m and a
maximum depth of 164 m with a relative error of 11.9%. The volume of the
glacier is derived as 0.3487$\pm$0.041 km3. Finally a 10-m grid map of the
bedrock topography was derived by subtracting the ice thicknesses from a
dual-frequency GPS-derived digital elevation model of the surface. These two
datasets are the first step for modelling thermal evolution of the glacier and
its bedrock, as well as the main hydrological network.

runtime and accuracy depend on the doubling dimension of the data points, and
can thus achieve superior classification performance in many common scenarios.
The algorithmic core of our approach is an approximate (rather than exact)

the fat-shattering dimension of Lipschitz classifiers, and we present

the frequency dependent time-lags for these two well-studied sources. We
discover high-frequency Fe K lags in both sources, indicating that the red wing
of the line precedes the rest frame energy by roughly 100 s and 150 s for Ark
564 and Mrk 335, respectively. Including these two new sources, Fe K
reverberation lags have been observed in seven Seyfert galaxies. We examine the
low-frequency lag-energy spectrum, which is smooth, and shows no feature of
reverberation, as would be expected if the low-frequency lags were produced by
distant reflection off circumnuclear material. The clear differences in the low
and high frequency lag-energy spectra indicate that the lags are produced by
two distinct physical processes. Finally, we find that the amplitude of the Fe
K lag scales with black hole mass for these seven sources, consistent with a
relativistic reflection model where the lag is the light travel delay
associated with reflection of continuum photons off the inner disc.

remarkable feature of our algorithms is the use of only constant space per

algorithm based on PGRL (Policy Gradient Reinforcement Learning), which is both
scalable, stable and robust. The term robust means that performance degradation
in the learning phase should be forbidden or limited to predefined thresholds.
The algorithm is model-free (as opposed to Value Iteration) and robust (as
opposed to Q-Learning). The association problem is modeled as a Markov Decision
Process (MDP). The policy space is parameterized. The parameterized family of
policies is then used as expert knowledge for the PGRL. The PGRL converges
towards a local optimum and the average cost decreases monotonically during the
learning process. The properties of the solution make it a good candidate for
practical implementation. Furthermore, the robustness property allows to use
the PGRL algorithm in an ""always-on"" learning mode.

samples for policy evaluation using the least squares temporal difference
(LSTD) algorithm. Our proposed scheme is equivalent to running regular temporal
difference learning with linear function approximation, albeit with samples
picked uniformly from a given dataset. Our method results in an $O(d)$
improvement in complexity in comparison to LSTD, where $d$ is the dimension of
the data. We provide non-asymptotic bounds for our proposed method, both in
high probability and in expectation, under the assumption that the matrix
underlying the LSTD solution is positive definite. The latter assumption can be
easily satisfied for the pathwise LSTD variant proposed in [23]. Moreover, we
also establish that using our method in place of LSTD does not impact the rate
of convergence of the approximate value function to the true value function.
These rate results coupled with the low computational complexity of our method
make it attractive for implementation in big data settings, where $d$ is large.
A similar low-complexity alternative for least squares regression is well-known
as the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm. We provide finite-time
bounds for SGD. We demonstrate the practicality of our method as an efficient
alternative for pathwise LSTD empirically by combining it with the least
squares policy iteration (LSPI) algorithm in a traffic signal control
application. We also conduct another set of experiments that combines the SA
based low-complexity variant for least squares regression with the LinUCB
algorithm for contextual bandits, using the large scale news recommendation

has been observed on the part of voters, in which negative information about a
candidate strengthens, rather than weakens, a prior positive opinion about the
candidate. This behavior appears to run counter to rational models of decision
making, and it is sometimes interpreted as evidence of non-rational ""motivated
reasoning"". We consider scenarios in which this effect arises in a model of
rational decision making which includes the possibility of deceptive
information. In particular, we will consider a model in which there are two
classes of voters, which we will call trusting voters and suspicious voters,
and two types of information sources, which we will call unbiased sources and
biased sources. In our model, new data about a candidate can be efficiently
incorporated by a trusting voter, and anomalous updates are impossible;
however, anomalous updates can be made by suspicious voters, if the information
source mistakenly plans for an audience of trusting voters, and if the partisan
goals of the information source are known by the suspicious voter to be
""opposite"" to his own. Our model is based on a formalism introduced by the
artificial intelligence community called ""multi-agent influence diagrams"",
which generalize Bayesian networks to settings involving multiple agents with
distinct goals.

correlated materials. In addition, the two-particle dynamic spin susceptibility
\chi_s(\omega,q) is investigated based on a simplified tight-binding approach,
yet by including vertex contributions in the DMFT linear response. Besides the
identification of paramagnon branches at higher doping, a prominent high-energy
antiferromagnetic mode close to x=0.67 is therewith identified in
\chi_s(\omega,q), which can be linked to extended hopping terms on the CoO_2

the concentration density maxima of the small dispersive coal dust particles
appear in the granular filtering medium with the cylindrical coal absorbent
granules in the horizontal iodine air filter at an action by the air dust
aerosol blow. The comparison of the measured aerodynamic resistances of the
horizontal and vertical iodine air filters is conducted. The main conclusion is
that the magnitude of the aerodynamic resistance of the horizontal iodine air
filters is much smaller in comparison with the magnitude of the aerodynamic
resistance of the vertical iodine air filters at the same loads of the air dust
aerosol volumes. It is explained that the direction of the air dust aerosol
blow and the direction of the gravitation force in the horizontal iodine air
filter are orthogonal, hence the effective accumulation of the small dispersive
coal dust particles takes place at the bottom of absorber in the horizontal
iodine air filter. It is found that the air dust aerosol stream flow in the

deposition conditions in an ultra-high-vacuum reactive magnetron sputtering
chamber. By increasing the deposition pressure from 2 to 9 mTorr while keeping
a nearly stoichiometric composition of Ti(1-x)N(x) (x=0.5), the film
resistivity increases, the dominant crystal orientation changes from (100) to
(111), grain boundaries become clearer, and the strong compressive strain
changes to weak tensile strain. The TiN films absorb a high concentration of
contaminants including hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen when they are exposed to
air after deposition. With the target-substrate distance set to 88 mm the
contaminant levels increase from ~0.1% to ~10% as the pressure is increased
from 2 to 9 mTorr. The contaminant concentrations also correlate with in-plane
distance from the center of the substrate and increase by roughly two orders of
magnitude as the target-substrate distance is increased from 88 mm to 266 mm.
These contaminants are found to strongly influence the properties of TiN films.
For instance, the resistivity of stoichiometric films increases by around a
factor of 5 as the oxygen content increases from 0.1% to 11%. These results
suggest that the sputtered TiN particle energy is critical in determining the
TiN film properties, and that it is important to control this energy to obtain
high-quality TiN films. Superconducting coplanar waveguide resonators made from
a series of nearly stoichiometric films grown at pressures from 2 mTorr to 7
mTorr show an increase in intrinsic quality factor from ~10^4 to ~10^6 as the
magnitude of the compressive strain decreases from nearly 3800 MPa to
approximately 150 MPa and the oxygen content increases from 0.1% to 8%. The
films with a higher oxygen content exhibit lower loss, but the nonuniformity of
the oxygen incorporation hinders the use of sputtered TiN in larger circuits.

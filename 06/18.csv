We characterize the distribution of the envelope of the first delay bin in

time-frequency variability of this channel parameter using vehicular channel
measurements at 5.6 GHz with a bandwidth of 240 MHz for safety-relevant
scenarios in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). This data enables a
frequency-variability analysis from an IEEE 802.11p system point of view, which
uses 10 MHz channels. We show that the small-scale fading of the envelope of
the first delay bin is Ricean distributed with a varying $K$-factor. The later
delay bins are Rayleigh distributed. We demonstrate that the $K$-factor cannot
be assumed to be constant in time and frequency. The causes of these variations
are the frequency-varying antenna radiation patterns as well as the
time-varying number of active scatterers, and the effects of vegetation. We
also present a simple but accurate bi-modal Gaussian mixture model, that allows
to capture the $K$-factor variability in time for safety-relevant ITS

broad range of applications, and it can be mathematically modeled as a
multi-armed bandit problem in which each distribution is associated with an
arm. This paper studies the sample complexity of identifying the best arm
(largest mean) in a multi-armed bandit problem. Motivated by large-scale
applications, we are especially interested in identifying situations where the
total number of samples that are necessary and sufficient to find the best arm
scale linearly with the number of arms. We present a single-parameter
multi-armed bandit model that spans the range from linear to superlinear sample
complexity. We also give a new algorithm for best arm identification, called
PRISM, with linear sample complexity for a wide range of mean distributions.
The algorithm, like most exploration procedures for multi-armed bandits, is
adaptive in the sense that the next arms to sample are selected based on
previous samples. We compare the sample complexity of adaptive procedures with
simpler non-adaptive procedures using new lower bounds. For many problem
instances, the increased sample complexity required by non-adaptive procedures
is a polynomial factor of the number of arms.

empirical copula process. The main contribution of this work is a
generalization of the multiplier resampling scheme proposed by B\""{u}cher and
Ruppert along two directions. First, the resampling scheme is now genuinely
sequential, thereby allowing to transpose to the strongly mixing setting many
of the existing multiplier tests on the unknown copula, including nonparametric
tests for change-point detection. Second, the resampling scheme is now fully
automatic as a data-adaptive procedure is proposed which can be used to
estimate the bandwidth parameter. A simulation study is used to investigate the
finite-sample performance of the resampling scheme and provides suggestions on
how to choose several additional parameters. As by-products of this work, the
validity of a sequential version of the dependent multiplier bootstrap for
empirical processes of B\""{u}hlmann is obtained under weaker conditions on the
strong mixing coefficients and the multipliers, and the weak convergence of the
sequential empirical copula process is established under many serial dependence
conditions.

number of arc segments in which the leaves move unidirectionally. This
facilitates an algorithm that determines the optimal piecewise linear leaf
trajectories for each arc segment, which are deliverable in a given treatment
time. Multi-leaf collimator (MLC) constraints, including maximum leaf speed and
interdigitation, are accounted for explicitly. The algorithm is customized to
allow for VMAT delivery using constant gantry speed and dose rate, however, the
algorithm generalizes to variable gantry speed if beneficial. We demonstrate
the method for three different tumor sites: a head-and-neck case, a prostate
case, and a paraspinal case. For that purpose, we first obtain a reference plan
for intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) using fluence map optimization and
20 equally spaced beam directions. Subsequently, VMAT plans are optimized by
dividing the 360-degree arc into 20 corresponding arc segments. Assuming
typical machine parameters (a dose rate of 600 MU/min, and a maximum leaf speed
of 3 cm/sec), it is demonstrated that the quality of the optimized VMAT plans
approaches the quality of the IMRT benchmark plan for delivery times between 3

clouds have a strong impact on the climate of planetary atmospheres.
Especially, the potential greenhouse effect of CO2 ice clouds in the
atmospheres of terrestrial extrasolar planets is of particular interest because
it might influence the position and thus the extension of the outer boundary of
the classic habitable zone around main sequence stars.
  We study the radiative effects of CO2 ice particles obtained by different
numerical treatments to solve the radiative transfer equation. The comparison
between the results of a high-order discrete ordinate method and simpler
two-stream approaches reveals large deviations in terms of a potential
scattering efficiency of the greenhouse effect. The two-stream methods
overestimate the transmitted and reflected radiation, thereby yielding a higher
scattering greenhouse effect. For the particular case of a cool M-type dwarf
the CO2 ice particles show no strong effective scattering greenhouse effect by
using the high-order discrete ordinate method, whereas a positive net
greenhouse effect was found in case of the two-stream radiative transfer
schemes. As a result, previous studies on the effects of CO2 ice clouds using
two-stream approximations overrated the atmospheric warming caused by the
scattering greenhouse effect. Consequently, the scattering greenhouse effect of
CO2 ice particles seems to be less effective than previously estimated. In
general, higher order radiative transfer methods are necessary to describe the
effects of CO2 ice clouds accurately as indicated by our numerical radiative
transfer studies.

manifold and the uniqueness of a compatible Poisson structure on the base, for
a special type of relational symplectic groupoids. We develop the notion of
equivalence, that allows us to compare finite and infinite dimensional

geometric quantization of symplectic manifolds in this new perspective.

spectra of comparable quality to those of z~6 quasars. The data exhibit a
smooth continuum at near-infrared wavelengths that is sharply cut off blueward
of 8410 Angs due to absorption from Ly-alpha at redshift z~5.91, with some flux
transmitted through the Ly-alpha forest between 7000-7800 Angs. We use column
densities inferred from metal absorption lines to constrain the metallicity of
the host galaxy between a lower limit of [Si/H]>-1.7 and an upper limit of
[S/H]<-0.5 set by the non-detection of S II absorption. We demonstrate
consistency between the dramatic evolution in the transmission fraction of
Ly-alpha seen in this spectrum over the redshift range z=4.9 to 5.85 with that
previously measured from observations of high-redshift quasars. There is an
extended redshift interval of Delta-z=0.12 in the Ly-alpha forest at z=5.77
with no detected transmission, leading to a 3-sigma upper limit on the mean
Ly-alpha transmission fraction of <0.2% (or tau_eff(Ly-alpha) > 6.4). This is
comparable to the lowest-redshift Gunn-Peterson troughs found in quasar
spectra. We set a 2-sigma upper limit of 0.11 on the neutral fraction of the
IGM at the redshift of the GRB from the lack of a Ly-alpha red damping wing,
assuming a model with a constant neutral density. Some Ly-beta and Ly-gamma
transmission is detected in this redshift window, indicating that it is not
completely opaque, and hence that the IGM is nonetheless mostly ionized at
these redshifts. GRB 130606A thus for the first time realizes the promise of

the flow. The constant $\alpha$ is a regime flow parameter that has the
dimension of the smallest scale being resolvable by the model. Hence, when
$\alpha=0$, one recovers the classical Navier-Stokes equations for a flow of
viscous, incompressible, Newtonian fluids. Furthermore, the
Navier-Stokes-$\alpha$ equations can also be interpreted as a regularization of
the Navier-Stokes equations, where $\alpha$ stands for the regularization
parameter.
  In this paper we first present the Navier-Stokes-$\alpha$ equations on

regularization using the Helmholtz operator. Then we study the problem of
relating the behavior of the Galerkin approximations for the

order to obtain global-in-time error estimates, we will work with the concept

experimentation, carried out on an Arabic corpus text, enables us to deduce
that there are queries which are not easily improvable with the query

selection of a sufficient number of documents D and to the extraction of a very
reduced set of relevant terms T for retrieval.

by millimeter CO or mid-IR spectroscopy, guaranteeing that the two bands sample
the rest-frame optical with the Balmer break falling between them. Eight of ten
are detected in both bands, while two are detected in F160W only. We study
their F160W morphologies, applying a maximum-deblending detection algorithm to
distinguish multiple- from single-component configurations, leading to
reassessments for several objects. Based on our NICMOS imaging and/or previous
dynamical evidence we identify five SMGs as multiple sources, which we
interpret as merging systems. Additionally, we calculate morphological
parameters asymmetry (A) and Gini coefficient (G); thanks to our sample's
limited redshift range we recover the trend that multiple-component,
merger-like morphologies are reflected in higher asymmetries. We analyze the
stellar populations of nine objects with F110W/F160W photometry, using archival
HST optical data when available. For multiple systems, we are able to model the
individual components that build up an SMG. With the available data we cannot
discriminate among star formation histories, but we constrain stellar masses
and mass ratios for merger-like SMG systems, obtaining a mean
log(M_*/M_sun)=10.9+/-0.2 for our full sample, with individual values
log(M_*/M_sun)~9.6-11.8. The morphologies and mass ratios of the least and most
massive systems match the predictions of the major-merger and cold accretion

those necessary to define the observed lines, as accurate as the computed
spectroscopic constants for many of the known interstellar anions.
Additionally, the computed Deff for C3H- is three times closer to the D deduced
from the observed Horsehead nebula lines relative to l-C3H+. As a result, 1
^1A' C3H- is a more viable candidate for these observed rotational transitions.
It has been previously proposed that at least C6H- may be present in the
Horsehead nebular PDR formed by way of radiative attachment through its
dipole-bound excited state. C3H- could form in a similar way through its
dipole-bound state, but its valence excited state increases the number of
relaxation pathways possible to reach the ground electronic state. In turn, the
rate of formation for C3H- could be greater than the rate of its destruction.
C3H- would be the seventh confirmed interstellar anion detected within the past
decade and the first CnH- molecular anion with an odd n.

traditionally been traced through dust continuum spectral energy distributions

explored due to lack of high-J CO observations. The aim is to constrain the
physical characteristics (excitation, kinematics, column density) of the warm
gas toward 26 low-mass Class 0 and I YSOs using spectrally-resolved Herschel
Space Observatory data of high-J lines of CO. Data are complemented by
ground-based observations from APEX and the JCMT to compare those with the
colder gas traced by lower-J CO lines. This is the first large spectrally
resolved high-J CO survey conducted for these types of sources. The median
excitation temperatures for 12CO, 13CO and C18O derived from single-temperature
fits to the J_u=2-10 integrated intensities are ~70K, 48K and 37K,
respectively, with no significant difference between Class 0 and I sources and
no trend with M_env or L_bol. Thus, in contrast with the continuum SEDs, the
spectral line energy distributions (SLEDs) do not show an evolution during the
embedded stage. In contrast, the integrated line intensities of all CO
isotopologs show a clear decrease with evolutionary stage as the envelope is
dispersed. The H2O 110-101/CO 10-9 intensity ratio does not change
significantly with velocity, in contrast with the H2O/CO 3-2 ratio, indicating
that CO 10-9 is the lowest transition for which the line wings probe the same
warm shocked gas as H2O. Modeling of the full suite of C18O lines indicates an
abundance profile for Class 0 sources that is consistent with a freeze-out zone
below 25 K and evaporation at higher temperatures, with but some fraction of
the CO transformed into other species in the cold phase. In contrast,
observations for two Class I sources in Ophiuchus are consistent with a
constant high CO abundance profile.

asteroseismology. This data, along with helioseismic measurements and open
cluster spin down studies, provide powerful clues about the nature and
timescale for internal angular momentum transport in stars. We focus on two
cases: the metal poor red giant KIC 7341231 (""Otto"") and intermediate mass core
helium burning stars. For both we examine limiting case studies for angular
momentum coupling between cores and envelopes under the assumption of rigid
rotation on the main sequence. We discuss the expected pattern of core rotation
as a function of mass and radius. In the case of Otto, strong
post-main-sequence coupling is ruled out and the measured core rotation rate is
in the range of 23 to 33 times the surface value expected from standard spin
down models. The minimum coupling time scale (.17 to .45 Gyr) is significantly
longer than that inferred for young open cluster stars. This implies
ineffective internal angular momentum transport in early first ascent giants.
By contrast, the core rotation rates of evolved secondary clump stars are found
to be consistent with strong coupling given their rapid main sequence rotation.
An extrapolation to the white dwarf regime predicts rotation periods between
330 and .0052 days depending on mass and decoupling time. We identify two key
ingredients that explain these features: the presence of a convective core and
inefficient angular momentum transport in the presence of larger mean molecular
weight gradients. Observational tests that can disentangle these effects are
discussed.

our Galaxy and likely plays an important role also during structure formation
in the early Universe. The density PDF and the power spectrum of such
compressible, supersonic turbulence are the key ingredients for theories of
star formation. However, both the PDF and the spectrum are still a matter of
debate, because theoretical predictions are limited and simulations of
supersonic turbulence require enormous resolutions to capture the
inertial-range scaling. To advance our limited knowledge of compressible
turbulence, we here present and analyse the world's largest simulations of
supersonic turbulence. We compare hydrodynamic models with numerical
resolutions of 256^3-4096^3 mesh points and with two distinct driving
mechanisms, solenoidal (divergence-free) driving and compressive (curl-free)
driving. We find convergence of the density PDF, with compressive driving
exhibiting a much wider and more intermittent density distribution than
solenoidal driving. Analysing the power spectrum of the turbulence, we find a
pure velocity scaling close to Burgers turbulence with P(v) k^(-2) for both
driving modes in our hydrodynamical simulations with Mach = 17. The spectrum of
the density-weighted velocity rho^(1/3)v, however, does not provide the
previously suggested universal scaling for supersonic turbulence. We find that
the power spectrum P(rho^(1/3)v) scales with wavenumber as k^(-1.74) for
solenoidal driving, close to incompressible Kolmogorov turbulence, k^(-5/3),
but is significantly steeper with k^(-2.10) for compressive driving. We show
that this is consistent with a recent theoretical model for compressible
turbulence that predicts P(rho^(1/3)v) k^(-19/9) in the presence of a strong
div(v) component as is produced by compressive driving and remains remarkably
constant throughout the supersonic turbulent cascade.

mass range 10^12.5 < M_halo/M_sol < 10^14.5. In agreement with previous work,
we find that halo mass-gap is related to halo formation time and concentration.
On average, older and more highly concentrated halos have larger halo
mass-gaps, and this trend is stronger than the mass-concentration relation over
a similar dynamic range. However, there is a large amount of scatter owing to
the transitory nature of the satellite subhalo population, which limits the use
of the halo mass-gap statistic on an object-by-object basis. For example, we
find that 20% of very large halo mass-gap systems (akin to ""fossil groups"") are
young, and have likely experienced a recent merger between a massive satellite
subhalo and the central subhalo. We relate halo mass-gap to the observable
stellar mass-gap via abundance matching. Using a galaxy group catalog
constructed from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, we find that the
star formation and structural properties of galaxies at fixed mass show no
trend with stellar mass-gap. This is despite a variation in halo-age of ~2.5
Gyr over ~1.2 dex in stellar mass-gap. Thus, we find no evidence to suggest
that the halo formation history significantly affects galaxy properties.

observations assume the intracluster gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium with
their gravitational potential. However, since galaxy clusters are dynamically
active objects whose dynamical states can deviate significantly from the
equilibrium configuration, the departure from the hydrostatic equilibrium
assumption is one of the largest sources of systematic uncertainties in cluster
cosmology. In the literature there has been two methods for computing the
hydrostatic mass bias based on the Euler and the modified Jeans equations,
respectively, and there has been some confusion about the validity of these two
methods. The word ""Jeans"" was a misnomer, which incorrectly implies that the
gas is collisionless. To avoid further confusion, we instead refer these
methods as ""summation"" and ""averaging"" methods respectively. In this work, we
show that these two methods for computing the hydrostatic mass bias are
equivalent by demonstrating that the equation used in the second method can be
derived from taking spatial averages of the Euler equation. Specifically, we
identify the correspondences of individual terms in these two methods
mathematically and show that these correspondences are valid to within a few
percent level using hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy cluster formation. In
addition, we compute the mass bias associated with the acceleration of gas and
show that its contribution is small in the virialized regions in the interior
of galaxy cluster, but becomes non-negligible in the cluster outskirts of
massive clusters where materials are being actively accreted. We discuss
implications for understanding the origin of hydrostatic mass biases and for
characterizing them using hydrodynamical simulations as well as observations.

0.02 arcsec/yr, corresponding to 1200 +/- 200 km/s at 2.5kpc. There is
substantial variation in the derived proper motions, indicating shock
velocities ranging from just below 700 km/s to above 2200 km/s.
  The optical proper motion is lower than the previously measured X-ray proper
motion of northeastern region. The new measurements are consistent with the
previously measured proton temperature of 2.3 +/- 0.3 keV, assuming no
cosmic-ray acceleration. However, within the uncertainties, moderately
efficient (< 27 per cent) shock acceleration is still possible. The combination
of optical proper motion and proton temperature rule out the possibility that
RCW 86 has a distance less than 1.5kpc.
  The similarity of the proper motions in the northeast and southeast is
peculiar, given the different densities and X-ray emission properties of the
regions. The northeastern region has lower densities and the X-ray emission is
synchrotron dominated, suggesting that the shock velocities should be higher
than in the southeastern, thermal X-ray dominated, region. A possible solution
is that the H-alpha emitting filaments are biased toward denser regions, with
lower shock velocities. Alternatively, in the northeast the shock velocity may
have decreased rapidly during the past 200yr, and the X-ray synchrotron
emission is an afterglow from a period when the shock velocity was higher.

never entered thermal equilibrium in the early Universe, since it only couples
to the Standard Model fields by a really small Higgs portal interaction. For
suitable values of this coupling, the scalar can undergo the so-called
freeze-in process, and in this way be efficiently produced in the early
Universe. These scalars can then decay into keV sterile neutrinos and produce
the correct Dark Matter abundance. While similar settings in which the scalar
does enter thermal equilibrium and then freezes out have been studied
previously, the mechanism proposed here is new and represents a versatile
extension of the known case. We perform a detailed numerical calculation of the
DM production using a set of coupled Boltzmann equations, and we illustrate the
successful regions in the parameter space. Our production mechanism notably can
even work in models where active-sterile mixing is completely absent.

quantum theory which, in the limit of a large number of e-foldings, gives rise
to a field theory on $S^3$, which is the representation space for a unitary
representation of SO(1,4). This is not a conventional CFT, and we do not know
the detailed non-perturbative axioms for correlation functions. However, the
two- and three-point functions are completely determined by symmetry, and
coincide up to a few constants (really functions of the background FRW
geometry) with those calculated in a single field slow-roll inflation model.
The only significant deviation from slow roll is in the tensor fluctuations. We
predict zero tensor tilt and roughly equal weight for all three conformally
invariant tensor 3-point functions (unless parity is imposed as a symmetry). We
discuss the relation between our results and those of Maldacena, McFadden,
Skenderis, and others. Current data can be explained in terms of symmetries and
a few general principles, and is consistent with a large class of models,

the most enigmatic feature of quantum mechanics. Measuring a quantum system
typically steers it towards a classical state, destroying any initial quantum
superposition and any entanglement with other quantum systems. Remarkably, the
measurement of a shared property between non-interacting quantum systems can
generate entanglement starting from an uncorrelated state. Of special interest
in quantum computing is the parity measurement, which projects a register of
quantum bits (qubits) to a state with an even or odd total number of
excitations. Crucially, a parity meter must discern the two parities with high
fidelity while preserving coherence between same-parity states. Despite
numerous proposals for atomic, semiconducting, and superconducting qubits,
realizing a parity meter creating entanglement for both even and odd
measurement results has remained an outstanding challenge. We realize a
time-resolved, continuous parity measurement of two superconducting qubits
using the cavity in a 3D circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) architecture
and phase-sensitive parametric amplification. Using postselection, we produce
entanglement by parity measurement reaching 77% concurrence. Incorporating the
parity meter in a feedback-control loop, we transform the entanglement
generation from probabilistic to fully deterministic, achieving 66% fidelity to
a target Bell state on demand. These realizations of a parity meter and a
feedback-enabled deterministic measurement protocol provide key ingredients for
active quantum error correction in the solid state.

Firstly we prove that the Jacobi ring associated to Wcan is isomorphic to the
quantum cohomology ring of the quadric, and that this isomorphism is compatible
with the identification of homogeneous coordinates on Xcan with elements of
H*(X,C). Secondly we find a very natural Laurent polynomial formula for Wcan by
restricting it to a `Lusztig torus' in Xcan. Thirdly we show that the Dubrovin

unraveled parts of the genetic history of the continent using genotyping arrays

the genomic contributions of African, European, and Native American ancestry to
these populations. Estimated Native American ancestry is 48% in MXL, 25% in

populations surrounding the Orinoco River basin, confirming the Southern
America ancestry of the Ta\'ino people of the Caribbean. We present new methods
to estimate the allele frequencies in the Native American fraction of the
populations, and model their distribution using a demographic model for three
ancestral Native American populations. These ancestral populations likely split
in close succession: the most likely scenario, based on a peopling of the
Americas 16 thousand years ago (kya), supports that the MXL Ancestors split
12.2kya, with a subsequent split of the ancestors to CLM and PUR 11.7kya. The
model also features effective populations of 62,000 in Mexico, 8,700 in
Colombia, and 1,900 in Puerto Rico. Modeling Identity-by-descent and ancestry
tract length, we show that post-contact populations differ markedly in their
effective sizes and migration patterns, with Puerto Rico showing the smallest

evolution models indicate that the progenitor of such a high-mass WD endured a
stable carbon-burning phase, producing an oxygen-neon-core WD. The discovery of
pulsations in GD 518 thus offers the first opportunity to probe the interior of
a WD with a possible oxygen-neon core. Such a massive WD should also be
significantly crystallized at this temperature. The star exhibits
multi-periodic luminosity variations at timescales ranging from roughly 425-595
s and amplitudes up to 0.7%, consistent in period and amplitude with the
observed variability of typical ZZ Ceti stars, which exhibit non-radial g-mode
pulsations driven by a hydrogen partial ionization zone. Successfully
unraveling both the total mass and core composition of GD 518 provides a unique
opportunity to investigate intermediate-mass stellar evolution, and can
possibly place an upper limit to the mass of a carbon-oxygen-core WD, which in

galaxies with high star formation rates: at 0.6 < z < 0.9 the median star
formation rate is at the upper 95th percentile of optically-selected (r<22.5)
galaxies and the sample contains about 50 per cent of all NUV < 22.8, 0.6 < z <
0.9 starburst galaxies within the volume sampled.
  The most luminous galaxies in our sample (-21.0>M_NUV>-22.5) evolve very
rapidly with a number density declining as (1+z)^{5\pm 1} from redshift z = 0.9
to z = 0.6. These starburst galaxies (M_NUV<-21 is approximately a star
formation rate of 30 \msuny) contribute about 1 per cent of cosmic star
formation over the redshift range z=0.6 to z=0.9. The star formation rate
density of these very luminous galaxies evolves rapidly, as (1+z)^{4\pm 1}.
Such a rapid evolution implies the majority of star formation in these large
galaxies must have occurred before z = 0.9.
  We measure the UV luminosity function in 0.05 redshift intervals spanning
0.1<z<0.9, and provide analytic fits to the results. At all redshifts greater
than z=0.55 we find that the bright end of the luminosity function is not well
described by a pure Schechter function due to an excess of very luminous
(M_NUV<-22) galaxies. These luminosity functions can be used to create a radial
selection function for the WiggleZ survey or test models of galaxy formation
and evolution. Here we test the AGN feedback model in Scannapieco et al.

to vary with one or more of the following: stellar mass, star formation rate

massive Gaussian Markov random fields, autologistic models and Exponential

Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) or analytic approximations to the

which can be applied to a subset of doubly-intractable distributions, have also
been developed and are described in this paper. As yet, no general method
exists which can be applied to all classes of models with doubly-intractable

study an alternative method based on representing the intractable likelihood as
an infinite series. Unbiased estimates of the likelihood can then be obtained
by finite time stochastic truncation of the series via Russian Roulette
sampling, although the estimates are not necessarily positive. Results from the
Quantum Chromodynamics literature are exploited to allow the use of possibly
negative estimates in a pseudo-marginal MCMC scheme such that expectations with
respect to the posterior distribution are preserved. The methodology is
reviewed on well-known examples such as the parameters in Ising models, the
posterior for Fisher-Bingham distributions on the $d$-Sphere and a large-scale

to a critical assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the methodology

object whose survival is believed to depend on the maximum mass supported by
the nuclear equation of state, angular momentum redistribution by
(magneto-)rotational instabilities, and spindown by gravitational waves. The
high temperatures (~5-40 MeV) prevailing in the merger remnant may provide
thermal pressure support that could increase its maximum mass and, thus, its
life on a neutrino-cooling timescale. We investigate the role of thermal
pressure support in hypermassive merger remnants by computing sequences of
spherically-symmetric and axisymmetric uniformly and differentially rotating
equilibrium solutions to the general-relativistic stellar structure equations.
Using a set of finite-temperature nuclear equations of state, we find that hot
maximum-mass critically spinning configurations generally do not support larger
baryonic masses than their cold counterparts. However, subcritically spinning
configurations with mean density of less than a few times nuclear saturation
density yield a significantly thermally enhanced mass. Even without decreasing
the maximum mass, cooling and other forms of energy loss can drive the remnant
to an unstable state. We infer secular instability by identifying approximate
energy turning points in equilibrium sequences of constant baryonic mass
parametrized by maximum density. Energy loss carries the remnant along the
direction of decreasing gravitational mass and higher density until instability
triggers collapse. Since configurations with more thermal pressure support are
less compact and thus begin their evolution at a lower maximum density, they
remain stable for longer periods after merger.

extends to wider class of gravitational theories, which encompasses General

In the GR case the results are in complete accordance with the known

  on Signal Processing",,,,"cs.IT cs.CR math.IT stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The problem of distributed inference with M-ary quantized data at the sensors
is investigated in the presence of Byzantine attacks. We assume that the
attacker does not have knowledge about either the true state of the phenomenon
of interest, or the quantization thresholds used at the sensors. Therefore, the
Byzantine nodes attack the inference network by modifying modifying the symbol
corresponding to the quantized data to one of the other M symbols in the
quantization alphabet-set and transmitting the false symbol to the fusion
center (FC). In this paper, we find the optimal Byzantine attack that blinds
any distributed inference network. As the quantization alphabet size increases,
a tremendous improvement in the security performance of the distributed
inference network is observed.
  We also investigate the problem of distributed inference in the presence of
resource-constrained Byzantine attacks. In particular, we focus our attention
on two problems: distributed detection and distributed estimation, when the
Byzantine attacker employs a highly-symmetric attack. For both the problems, we
find the optimal attack strategies employed by the attacker to maximally
degrade the performance of the inference network. A reputation-based scheme for
identifying malicious nodes is also presented as the network's strategy to
mitigate the impact of Byzantine threats on the inference performance of the
distributed sensor network.

critical exponents of relevant operators. We have investigated these scaling
laws at leading order in two previous papers. In this work we investigate
further consequences of the scaling laws, trying to identify potential
signatures that could be studied by lattice simulations. From the first
derivative of the form factor we derive the behaviour of the mean charge radius
of the hadronic states in the theory. We obtain $\langle r_H^2 \rangle \sim
m^{-2/(1+\gamma^*_m)}$ which is consistent with $\langle r_H^2 \rangle \sim
1/M_H^{2}$. The mean charge radius can be used as an alternative observable to
assess the size of the physical states, and hence finite size effects, in
numerical simulations. Furthermore, we discuss the behaviour of specific field
correlators in coordinate space for the case of conformal, scale-invariant, and
confining theories making use of selection rules in scaling dimensions and
spin. We compute the scaling corrections to correlations functions by
linearizing the renormalization group equations. We find that these correction
are potentially large close to the edge of the conformal window. As an
application we compute the scaling correction to the formula $M_H \sim
m^{1/(1+\gamma_m^*)}$ directly through its associated correlator as well as
through the trace anomaly. The two computations are shown to be equivalent
through a generalisation of the Feynman-Hellmann theorem for the fermion mass,
and the gauge coupling.

the problem of controlling automatically the pentesting tool has become an
important question. This can be naturally addressed as an attack planning
problem. Previous approaches to this problem were based on modeling the actions
and assets in the PDDL language, and using off-the-shelf AI tools to generate
attack plans. These approaches however are limited. In particular, the planning
is classical (the actions are deterministic) and thus not able to handle the
uncertainty involved in this form of attack planning.
  We herein contribute a planning model that does capture the uncertainty about
the results of the actions, which is modeled as a probability of success of
each action. We present efficient planning algorithms, specifically designed
for this problem, that achieve industrial-scale runtime performance (able to
solve scenarios with several hundred hosts and exploits). These algorithms take
into account the probability of success of the actions and their expected cost
(for example in terms of execution time, or network traffic generated).
  We thus show that probabilistic attack planning can be solved efficiently for
the scenarios that arise when assessing the security of large networks. Two
""primitives"" are presented, which are used as building blocks in a framework
separating the overall problem into two levels of abstraction. We also present
the experimental results obtained with our implementation, and conclude with
some ideas for further work.

scatter of 5-10% in distance widely attributed to an intrinsic dispersion in
luminosity. Another, equally valid, source of this scatter is intrinsic
dispersion in color. Misidentification of the true source of this scatter can
bias both the retrieved color-luminosity relation and cosmological parameter
measurements. The size of this bias depends on the magnitude of the intrinsic
color dispersion relative to the distribution of colors that correlate with
distance. We produce a realistic simulation of a misattribution of intrinsic
scatter, and find a negative bias in the recovered color-luminosity relation,
beta, of dbeta -1.0 (~33%) and a positive bias in the equation of state
parameter, w, of dw +0.04 (~4%). We re-analyze current published data sets with
the assumptions that the distance scatter is predominantly the result of color.
Unlike previous analyses, we find that the data are consistent with a Milky Way
reddening law R_V=3.1, and that a Milky Way dust model better predicts the
asymmetric color-luminosity trends than the conventional luminosity scatter
hypothesis. We also determine that accounting for color variation reduces the
correlation between various Host galaxy properties and Hubble residuals by
~20%.

Finding optimal schemes of generating non-classical photonic states is of
critical importance for this field as physically implementable photon-photon
entangling operations are currently limited to measurement-assisted stochastic
transformations. A critical parameter for assessing the efficiency of such
transformations is the success probability of a desired measurement outcome. At
present there are several experimental groups which are capable of generating
multi-photon cluster states carrying more than eight qubits. Separate photonic
qubits or small clusters can be fused into a single cluster state by a
probabilistic optical CZ gate conditioned on simultaneous detection of all
photons with 1/9 success probability of each gate. This design mechanically
follows the original theoretical scheme of cluster state generation proposed
more than a decade ago by Raussendorf, Browne and Briegel. The optimality of
the destructive CZ gate in application to linear optical cluster state
generation has not been analyzed previously. Our results reveal that this
method is far from the optimal one. Employing numerical optimization we have
identified that maximal success probability of fusing n unentangled dual-rail
optical qubits into a linear cluster state is equal to 1/2^(n-1); m-tuple of
photonic Bell pair states, commonly generated via spontaneous parametric
down-conversion, can be fused into a single cluster with the maximal success

image database management, certification and authentication and digital
watermarking. We propose a Block-DCT and PCA based image perceptual hash in
this article and explore the algorithm in the application of tamper detection.
The main idea of the algorithm is to integrate color histogram and DCT
coefficients of image blocks as perceptual feature, then to compress perceptual
features as inter-feature with PCA, and to threshold to create a robust hash.
The robustness and discrimination properties of the proposed algorithm are
evaluated in detail. Our algorithms first construct a secondary image, derived
from input image by pseudo-randomly extracting features that approximately
capture semi-global geometric characteristics. From the secondary image (which
does not perceptually resemble the input), we further extract the final
features which can be used as a hash value (and can be further suitably
quantized). In this paper, we use spectral matrix invariants as embodied by
Singular Value Decomposition. Surprisingly, formation of the secondary image
turns out be quite important since it not only introduces further robustness,
but also enhances the security properties. Indeed, our experiments reveal that
our hashing algorithms extract most of the geometric information from the
images and hence are robust to severe perturbations (e.g. up to %50 cropping by
area with 20 degree rotations) on images while avoiding misclassification.
Experimental results show that the proposed image perceptual hash algorithm can
effectively address the tamper detection problem with advantageous robustness
and discrimination.

  $\ell_1$-Regularized Minimization",,,,,"cs.LG cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The recent years have witnessed advances in parallel algorithms for large
scale optimization problems. Notwithstanding demonstrated success, existing
algorithms that parallelize over features are usually limited by divergence
issues under high parallelism or require data preprocessing to alleviate these
problems. In this work, we propose a Parallel Coordinate Descent Newton
algorithm using multidimensional approximate Newton steps (PCDN), where the
off-diagonal elements of the Hessian are set to zero to enable parallelization.
It randomly partitions the feature set into $b$ bundles/subsets with size of
$P$, and sequentially processes each bundle by first computing the descent
directions for each feature in parallel and then conducting $P$-dimensional
line search to obtain the step size. We show that: (1) PCDN is guaranteed to
converge globally despite increasing parallelism; (2) PCDN converges to the
specified accuracy $\epsilon$ within the limited iteration number of
$T_\epsilon$, and $T_\epsilon$ decreases with increasing parallelism (bundle
size $P$). Using the implementation technique of maintaining intermediate
quantities, we minimize the data transfer and synchronization cost of the
$P$-dimensional line search. For concreteness, the proposed PCDN algorithm is
applied to $\ell_1$-regularized logistic regression and $\ell_2$-loss SVM.
Experimental evaluations on six benchmark datasets show that the proposed PCDN
algorithm exploits parallelism well and outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods in speed without losing accuracy.

networks. While in some cases these transfers happen in background without
specific constraints in terms of delivery times, there are a number of
scenarios in which the transfer of tens of GB of data must occur in specific,
limited time windows. In order to face this task, a suitable solution is the
deployment of virtual links with guaranteed bandwidth between endpoints
provided by a Service Overlay Network (SON) provider. We model this scenario as
an optimization problem, in which the target consists of minimizing the costs
of the virtual links provided by the SON and the unknowns are the provisioned
bandwidths of these links. Since the resulting objective function is neither
continuous nor convex, the solution of this problem is really challenging for
standard optimization tools in terms of both convergence time and solution
optimality. We propose a solution based on an heuristic approach which uses the
min-plus algebra. Numerical results show that the proposed heuristic
outperforms the considered optimization tools, whilst maintaining an affordable

which is determined by H. In this paper we give an explicit construction of a
homotopy inverse Psi of Phi. Contrary to other previously defined maps going in
the same direction, Psi is an isomorphism at the chain level and preserves the
action filtration. Its definition is based on counting Floer trajectories on
the negative half-cylinder which on the boundary satisfy ""half"" of the Hamilton
equations. Albeit not of Lagrangian type, such a boundary condition defines
Fredholm operators with good compactness properties. We also present a
heuristic argument which, independently on any Fredholm and compactness
analysis, explains why the spaces of maps which are used in the definition of
Phi and Psi are the natural ones. The Legendre transform plays a crucial role
both in our rigorous and in our heuristic arguments. We treat with some detail
the delicate issue of orientations and show that the homology of the Floer

the so-called noncritical SHG case, where no phase matching can be achieved but
as a compensation the largest quadratic nonlinearities are exploited. A

is larger than the competing material self-focusing nonlinearity, and we define
a suitable figure of merit to screen a wide range of mid-IR dielectric and

large $d_{\rm eff}$. We show selected realistic numerical examples using one of

Non-Gaussian covariance estimation, e.g., Tyler scatter estimator and
Multivariate Generalized Gaussian distribution methods, usually involve
non-convex minimization problems. Recently, it was shown that the underlying
principle behind their success is an extended form of convexity over the
geodesics in the manifold of positive definite matrices. A modern approach to
improve estimation accuracy is to exploit prior knowledge via additional
constraints, e.g., restricting the attention to specific classes of covariances
which adhere to prior symmetry structures. In this paper, we prove that such
group symmetry constraints are also geodesically convex and can therefore be
incorporated into various non-Gaussian covariance estimators. Practical
examples of such sets include: circulant, persymmetric and complex/quaternion

simultaneously, for the pseudoscalar mesons that can be built with 4 quarks and

behaviour of the oscillators in a complex system, is one of the most crucial
factors to control the dynamics and streamline various processes in complex
networks. In this paper, we have demonstrated the occurrence of multi-stable
states in a system of identical phase oscillators that are dynamically coupled.
We find that the multi-stable state is comprised of a two cluster
synchronization state where the clusters are in anti-phase relationship with
each other and a desynchronization state. We also find that the phase
relationship between the oscillators is asymptotically stable irrespective of
whether there is synchronization or desynchronization in the system. The time
scale of the coupling affects the size of the clusters in the two cluster
state. We also investigate the effect of both the coupling asymmetry and
plasticity asymmetry on the multi-stable states. In the absence of coupling
asymmetry, increasing the plasticity asymmetry causes the system to go from a
two clustered state to a desynchronization state and then to a two clustered
state. Further, the coupling asymmetry, if present, also affects this
transition. We also analytically find the occurrence of the above mentioned
multi-stable-desynchronization-multi-stable state transition. A brief
discussion on the phase evolution of nonidentical oscillators is also provided.
Our analytical results are in good agreement with our numerical observations.

Frobenius algebras in the category Rel, as well as an adjunction between a
special type of semigroupoids and relative H*-algebras. The connection between
groupoids and Frobenius algebras is made explicit by introducing what we called
weak monoids and relational symplectic groupoids, in the context of Poisson
sigma models with boundary and in particular, describing such structures in the
ex- tended symplectic category and the category of Hilbert spaces. This is part
of a joint work with Alberto Cattaneo and Chris Heunen.

been associated with divergence-free fields and the absence of long-range
order. Here, we go beyond this paradigm, demonstrating that a Coulomb phase can
emerge naturally as a persistent fluctuating background in an otherwise ordered
system. To explain this behavior, we introduce the concept of the fragmentation
of the field of magnetic moments into two parts, one giving rise to a magnetic
monopole crystal, the other a magnetic fluid with all the characteristics of an
emergent Coulomb phase. Our theory is backed up by numerical simulations, and
we discuss its importance with regard to the interpretation of a number of
experimental results.

among very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in the Hyades open cluster. Using
the Keck\,II adaptive optics system, we observed a complete sample of 16
objects with estimated masses $\lesssim$0.1 Msun. We have identified three
close binaries with projected separation $\lesssim$0.11"", or $\lesssim$5 AU. A
number of wide, mostly faint candidate companions are also detected in our
images, most of which are revealed as unrelated background sources based on
astrometric and/or photometric considerations. The derived multiplicity
frequency, 19+13/-6 % over the 2-350 AU range, and the rarity of systems wider
than 10 AU are both consistent with observations of field very low-mass
objects. In the limited 3-50 AU separation range, the companion frequency is
essentially constant from brown dwarfs to solar-type stars in the Hyades
cluster, which is also in line with our current knowledge for field stars.
Combining the binaries discovered in this surveys with those already known in
the Pleiades cluster reveals that very low-mass binaries in open clusters, as
well as in star-forming regions, are skewed toward lower mass ratios ($0.6
\lesssim q \lesssim 0.8$) than are their field counterparts, a result that
cannot be accounted for by selection effects. Although the possibility of
severe systematic errors in model-based mass estimates for very low-mass stars
cannot be completely excluded, it is unlikely to explain this difference. We
speculate that this trend indicates that surveys among very low-mass field
stars may have missed a substantial population of intermediate mass ratio
systems, implying that these systems are more common and more diverse than
previously thought.

prewhitening step, which reduces the channel matrix to a unitary one followed
by a separation step where the resulting unitary matrix is computed using
Givens rotations by minimizing the CM criterion. However, for small sample
sizes, the prewhitening does not make the channel matrix close enough to

performance. To remediate to this problem, we propose to use non-unitary Shear

multiplex and the interrelation with the awareness process. Interestingly, the
critical point for the onset of the epidemics has a critical value

$\delta_{CP}=$, $|\theta_{23}-45^{\circ}|\rightarrow5^{\circ}$ for inverted

a rigid body in a J2 gravity field for new high-precision applications in the
celestial mechanics and astrodynamics. Unlike the original J2 problem, the
gravitational orbit-rotation coupling of the rigid body is considered in the
generalized problem. The existence and properties of both the classical and
non-classical relative equilibria of the rigid body are investigated in more
details in the present paper based on our previous results. We
nondimensionalize the system by the characteristic time and length to make the
study more general. Through the study, it is found that the classical relative
equilibria can always exist in the real physical situation. Numerical results
suggest that the non-classical relative equilibria only can exist in the case
of a negative J2, i.e., the central body is elongated; they cannot exist in the
case of a positive J2 when the central body is oblate. In the case of a
negative J2, the effect of the orbit-rotation coupling of the rigid body on the
existence of the non-classical relative equilibria can be positive or negative,
which depends on the values of J2 and the angular velocity. The bifurcation
from the classical relative equilibria, at which the non-classical relative
equilibria appear, has been shown with different parameters of the system. Our
results here have given more details of the relative equilibria than our
previous paper, in which the existence conditions of the relative equilibria
are derived and primarily studied. Our results have also extended the previous
results on the relative equilibria of a rigid body in a central gravity field
by taking into account the oblateness of the central body.

endowed with positive integral weights. The degree of a vertex is defined as
the sum of the weights of the edges incident to this vertex. Using the theory
of dessins d'enfants, which studies the action of the absolute Galois group on
graphs embedded into Riemann surfaces, we show that a weighted plane tree is a
graphical representation of a pair of coprime complex polynomials A,B such
that: (a) deg A = deg B, and A and B have the same leading coefficient; (b) the
multiplicities of the roots of A (respectively, of B) are equal to the degrees
of the black (respectively, white) vertices of the corresponding tree; (c) the
degree of the difference A-B attains the minimum which is possible for the
given multiplicities of the roots of A and B. Moreover, if a tree in question
is uniquely determined by the set of its black and white vertex degrees (we
call such trees unitrees), then the corresponding polynomials are defined over
Q.
  The pairs of polynomials A,B such that the degree of the difference A-B
attains the minimum, and especially those defined over Q, are related to some
important questions of number theory. Dozens of papers were dedicated to their
study. The main result of this paper is a complete classification of the
unitrees which provides us with the most massive class of such pairs defined
over Q. We also study combinatorial invariants of the Galois action on trees,

more examples defined over Q. In a subsequent paper we compute the polynomials
A,B corresponding to all the unitrees.

wind at higher altitudes than conventional wind towers. We present the results
obtained from three-dimensional finite volume numerical simulations of the
steady air flow past a three-dimensional curved rectangular kite wing (aspect
ratio equal to 3.2, Reynolds number equal to 3x10^6). Two angles of incidence
-- a standard incidence for the flight of a tethered airfoil (6{\deg}) and an
incidence close to the stall (18{\deg}) -- were considered. The simulations
were performed by solving the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes flow model using
the industrial STAR-CCM+ code. The overall aerodynamic characteristics of the
kite wing were determined and compared to the aerodynamic characteristics of
the flat rectangular non twisted wing with an identical aspect ratio and
section (Clark Y profile). The boundary layer of both the curved and the flat
wings was considered to be turbulent throughout. It was observed that the
curvature induces only a mild deterioration of the aerodynamics properties.
Pressure distributions around different sections along the span are also
presented, together with isolines of the average pressure and kinetic energy
fields at a few sections across the wing and the wake. Our results indicate
that the curvature induces a slower spatial decay of the vorticity in the wake,
and in particular, inside the wing tip vortices.

powerful approach to measure the distribution of matter in the universe, which
can be used to learn about the nature of dark energy, physics of inflation,
neutrino masses, etc. A competitive survey, however, requires a large volume
(e.g., Vsurvey is roughly 10 Gpc3) to be covered, and thus tends to be
expensive. A ""sparse sampling"" method offers a more affordable solution to this
problem: within a survey footprint covering a given survey volume, Vsurvey, we
observe only a fraction of the volume. The distribution of observed regions
should be chosen such that their separation is smaller than the length scale
corresponding to the wavenumber of interest. Then one can recover the power
spectrum of galaxies with precision expected for a survey covering a volume of
Vsurvey (rather than the volume of the sum of observed regions) with the number
density of galaxies given by the total number of observed galaxies divided by
Vsurvey (rather than the number density of galaxies within an observed region).
We find that regularly-spaced sampling yields an unbiased power spectrum with
no window function effect, and deviations from regularly-spaced sampling, which
are unavoidable in realistic surveys, introduce calculable window function
effects and increase the uncertainties of the recovered power spectrum. While
we discuss the sparse sampling method within the context of the forthcoming
Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment, the method is general and can be
applied to other galaxy surveys.

that has the field theoretical description of a solid. To allow for prolonged
slow roll inflation, the solid needs to be extremely insensitive to the spatial
expansion. We point out that, because of this property, the solid is also
rather inefficient in erasing anisotropic deformations of the geometry. This
allows for a prolonged inflationary anisotropic solution, providing the first
example with standard gravity and scalar fields only which evades the
conditions of the so called cosmic no-hair conjecture. We compute the curvature
perturbations on the anisotropic solution, and the corresponding
phenomenological bound on the anisotropy. Finally, we discuss the analogy
between this model and the f (phi) F^2 model, which also allows for anisotropic
inflation thanks to a suitable coupling between the inflaton phi and a vector
field. We remark that the bispectrum of the curvature perturbations in solid
inflation is enhanced in the squeezed limit and presents a nontrivial angular
dependence, as had previously been found for the f (phi) F^2 model.

right as a building block of many scientific applications and as a popular

back to 1969 was the first efficient algorithm for parallel matrix
multiplication providing theoretically optimal communication cost. However this
algorithm requires a square number of processors. In the mid 1990s, the SUMMA

as it can be used on a non-square number of processors as well. Since then the
number of processors in HPC platforms has increased by two orders of magnitude
making the contribution of communication in the overall execution time more
significant. Therefore, the state of the art parallel matrix multiplication
algorithms should be revisited to reduce the communication cost further. This
paper introduces a new parallel matrix multiplication algorithm, Hierarchical
SUMMA (HSUMMA), which is a redesign of SUMMA. Our algorithm reduces the
communication cost of SUMMA by introducing a two-level virtual hierarchy into
the two-dimensional arrangement of processors. Experiments on an IBM BlueGene-P
demonstrate the reduction of communication cost up to 2.08 times on 2048 cores

the convolution algebra of the subgroupoid of leaves satisfying the

ratchet (introduced in A. V. Arzola et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 168104
(2011)) and a comparison with experimental results are presented. The studied
system consists of a microscopic particle interacting with a periodic and
asymmetric light pattern, which is driven away from equilibrium by means of an
unbiased time- periodic external force. It is shown that the asymmetry of the
effective optical potential depends on the relative size of the particle with
respect to the spatial period, and this is analyzed as an effective mechanism
for particle fractionation. The necessary conditions to obtain current
reversals in the deterministic regime are discussed in detail.

CoRoT IDs 100746852, 102709980, and 105693572 provide potentially good matches

novel procedure, taking into account the fluctuations of the features
associated to photometric modulation at different time intervals and the
fractality traces that are present in the light curves of the Sun and of these
""New Sun"" candidates alike. In this sense, we computed the so-called Hurst
exponent for the referred stars, for a sample of fourteen CoRoT stars with sub-

quiet phases. We found that the Hurst exponent can provide a strong
discriminant of Sun-like behavior, going beyond what can be achieved with
solely the rotation period itself. In particular, we find that CoRoT ID
105693572 is the star that most closely matches the solar rotation properties,
as far as the latter's imprints on light curve behavior is concerned. The stars
CoRoT IDs 100746852 and 102709980 have significant smaller Hurst exponents than

axions (or other, perhaps not as well motivated, stable particles) to function

below standard estimates, and direct and indirect detection rates must be
accordingly rescaled. We calculate rescaled direct and indirect higgsino-like
WIMP detection rates in SUSY models that fulfil the electroweak naturalness

X-ray emission emanating from the central 100 pc x 100 pc region of our Galaxy
to an investigation of several features prominent in the soft X-ray (2-4.5 keV)
band. We focus on three specific structures: a putative bipolar outflow from
the vicinity of Sgr A*; a high surface brightness region located roughly 12
arcmin to the north-east of Sgr A*; and a lower surface-brightness extended
loop feature seen to the south of Sgr A*. We show that all three structures are
thermal in nature and have similar temperatures (kT ~ 1 keV). The inferred
X-ray luminosities lie in the range (2 - 10) x 10^34 erg s^-1. In the case of
the bipolar feature we suggest that the hot plasma is produced by the
shock-heating of the winds from massive stars within the Central Cluster,
possibly collimated by the Circumnuclear Disc. Alternatively the outflow may be
driven by outbursts on Sgr A*, which follow tidal disruption events occurring
at a rate of roughly 1 every 4000 yr. The north-east enhancement is centred on
a candidate PWN which has a relatively hard non-thermal X-ray spectrum. We
suggest that the coincident soft-thermal emission traces the core of a new
thermal-composite supernova remnant, designated as SNR G0.13-0.12. There is no
clear evidence for an associated radio shell but such a feature may be masked
by the bright emission of the nearby Radio Arc and other filamentary
structures. SNR G0.13-0.12 is very likely interacting with the nearby molecular
cloud, G0.11-0.11, and linked to the Fermi source, 2FGL J1746.4-2851c. Finally
we explore a previous suggestion that the elliptically-shaped X-ray loop to the
south of Sgr A*, of maximum extent ~45 pc, represents the shell of a
superbubble located in the GC region. Although plausible, the interpretation of
this feature in terms a coherent physical structure awaits confirmation.

small number statistics are large. By omitting very low luminosity pulsars, we

density, is an important input parameter in the model. Some of the published

groups giving quite different results. The results are relatively insensitive
to the progenitor metallicity, initial mass function, initial-final mass
relation and ratio of H/He atmosphere white dwarfs. Application to two
independent determinations of the Solar neighbourhood white dwarf luminosity
function gives similar results. The star formation rate has a bimodal form,
with broad peaks at 2-3 Gyr and 7-9 Gyr in the past, separated by a significant
lull of magnitude 30-90% depending on choice of cooling models. The onset of
star formation occurs around 8-10 Gyr ago. The total integrated star formation
rate is ~0.014 stars/pc3 in the Solar neighbourhood, for stars more massive
than 0.6M_{solar}.

cavity coupled to a superconducting charge qubit. In addition to previous
studies, we here also consider drive strengths large enough to energetically
allow for quasiparticle creation. Quasiparticle tunneling leads to the
inclusion of more than two charge states in the dynamics. To explain the
observed effects, we develop a master equation for the microwave dressed charge
states, including quasiparticle tunneling. A bimodal behavior of the frequency
shift as a function of gate voltage can be used for sensitive charge detection.
However, at weak drives the charge sensitivity is significantly reduced by
non-equilibrium quasiparticles, which induce transitions to a non-sensitive
state. Unexpectedly, at high enough drives, quasiparticle tunneling enables a
very fast relaxation channel to the sensitive state. In this regime, the charge
sensitivity is thus robust against externally injected quasiparticles and the
desired dynamics prevail over a broad range of temperatures. We find very good
agreement between theory and experiment over a wide range of drive strengths

DNA bound state in conditions where a duplex DNA would be in the denaturated

Efimov-DNA. In this paper we study the melting of the three-stranded DNA on a

can find again the existence of the Efimov-DNA-like state but quite

mixed state, where the strands are pair-wise bound but without three chain
contacts. Whereas the Efimov DNA turns out to be a crossover near melting, the
mixed phase is a thermodynamic phase.

whether torsion is set to zero i) a priori or ii) a posteriori, i.e., before or
after considering variations of the action. Considering a generic family of
Ricci-squared theories, we show that in both cases the connection can be
decomposed as the sum of a Levi-Civita connection and terms depending on a
vector field. However, while in case i) this vector field is related to the
symmetric part of the connection, in ii) it comes from the torsion part and,
therefore, it vanishes once torsion is completely removed. Moreover, the
vanishing of this torsion-related vector field immediately implies the
vanishing of the antisymmetric part of the Ricci tensor, which therefore plays
no role in the dynamics. Related to this, we find that the Levi-Civita part of
the connection is due to the existence of an invariant volume associated to an
auxiliary metric $h_{\mu\nu}$, which is algebraically related with the physical
metric $g_{\mu\nu}$.

techniques are correlated electronic structure methods promising for large

drawback in the present work we formulate the general problem of evaluating the
molecular equilibrium structures, the harmonic frequencies and the anharmonic
coefficients of an error affected potential energy surface. The proposed
approach, based on a multidimensional fitting procedure, is illustrated
together with a critical evaluation of systematic and statistical errors. We
observe that the use of forces instead of energies in the fitting procedure
reduces the the statistical uncertainty of the vibrational parameters by one
order of magnitude. Preliminary results based on Variational Monte Carlo
calculations on the water molecule demonstrate the possibility to evaluate
geometrical parameters, harmonic and anharmonic coefficients at this level of

enforcing local mass conservation in the XCAT lung. Dose calculations are
performed to assess the implications of neglecting mass conservation, and to
demonstrate an application of the phantom to calculate the accumulated
delivered dose in an irregularly breathing patient. Monte Carlo methods are
used to simulate conventional and SBRT treatment delivery. The spatial
distribution of the lung dose was qualitatively changed by the use of mass
conservation; however the corresponding DVH did not change significantly.
Comparison of the delivered dose with 4DCT-based predictions shows similar lung
metric results, however dose differences of 10% can be seen in some spatial
regions. Using this tool to simulate patient treatments reveals differences
between the planned dose and the calculated delivered dose for the full

bar and the inner disc of the LMC in the context of the formation of the bar.
We obtained high-resolution and mid signal-to-noise ratio spectra with
FLAMES/GIRAFFE at ESO/VLT and performed a detailed chemical analysis of 106 and
58 LMC field red giant stars (mostly older than 1 Gyr), located in the bar and
the disc of the LMC respectively. We measured elemental abundances for O, Mg,
Si, Ca, Ti, Na, Sc, V, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Y, Zr, Ba, La and Eu. We find that the
{\alpha}-element ratios [Mg/Fe] and [O/Fe] are lower in the LMC than in the MW
while the LMC has similar [Si/Fe], [Ca/Fe], and [Ti/Fe] to the MW. As for the
heavy elements, [Ba,La/Eu] exhibit a strong increase with increasing
metallicity starting from [Fe/H]=-0.8 dex, and the LMC has lower [Y+Zr/Ba+La]
ratios than the MW. Cu is almost constant over all metallicities and about 0.5
dex lower in the LMC than in the MW. The LMC bar and inner disc exhibit
differences in their [{\alpha}/Fe] (slightly larger scatter for the bar in the
metallicity range [-1,-0.5]), their Eu (the bar trend is above the disc trend
for [Fe/H] > -0.5 dex), their Y and Zr, their Na and their V (offset between
bar and disc distributions). Our results show that the chemical history of the
LMC experienced a strong contribution from type Ia supernovae as well as a
strong s-process enrichment from metal-poor AGB winds. Massive stars made a
smaller contribution to the chemical enrichment compared to the MW. The
observed differences between the bar and the disc speak in favour of an episode
of enhanced star formation a few Gyr ago, occurring in the central parts of the
LMC and leading to the formation of the bar. This is in agreement with recently
derived star formation histories.

the corresponding increase in carrier density and mobility of the

can be extended to other forms of mesoscopic devices. It overcomes previous

linear response of the crystal to atomic displacements. The basic ingredient,
which can be readily calculated from first principles in the framework of
density-functional perturbation theory, is the quantum-mechanical probability
current response to a long-wavelength acoustic phonon. Its second-order Taylor
expansion in the wavevector q around the Gamma (q=0) point in the Brillouin
zone naturally yields the flexoelectric tensor. At order one in q we recover
Martin's theory of piezoelectricity [R. M. Martin, Phys. Rev. B 5, 1607
(1972)], thus providing an alternative derivation thereof. To put our
derivations on firm theoretical grounds, we perform a thorough analysis of the
nonanalytic behavior of the dynamical matrix and other response functions in a
vicinity of Gamma. Based on this analysis, we find that there is an ambiguity
in the specification of the ""zero macroscopic field"" condition in the
flexoelectric case; such arbitrariness can be related to an analytic
band-structure term, in close analogy to the theory of deformation potentials.
As a byproduct, we derive a rigorous generalization of the Cochran-Cowley
formula [W. Cochran and R. A. Cowley, J. Phys. Chem. Solids 23, 447 (1962)] to
higher orders in q. This can be of great utility in building reliable atomistic
models of electromechanical phenomena, as well as for improving the accuracy of
the calculation of phonon dispersion curves. Finally, we discuss the physical
interpretation of the various contributions to the flexoelectric response,
either in the static or dynamic regime.

energy can be efficiently transferred between quantum dots. Specifically, in a
double quantum dot an incoming electron is captured by one dot and the excess
energy is transferred to the neighboring dot and used to remove an electron
from this dot. This process is due to long-range electron correlation and shown
to be operative at rather large distances between the dots. The efficiency of
the process is greatly enhanced by preparing the double quantum dot such that
the incoming electron is initially captured by a two-electron resonance state
of the system. In contrast to atoms and molecules in nature, double quantum
dots can be manipulated to achieve this enhancement. This mechanism leads to a
surprisingly narrow distribution of the energy of the electron removed in the
process which is explained by resonance theory. We argue that the process could
be exploited in practice.

we attribute to the influence of a quantum bicritical point (QBCP), that is
close in parameter space yet can be reached by tuning T_BCP further to zero.
Using high-resolution measurements of the magnetocaloric effect, we demonstrate
that the magnetic Grueneisen parameter Gamma_H indeed both changes sign and
diverges as required for quantum criticality. Moreover, Gamma_H displays a
characteristic scaling behavior but only on the low-field side, H < H_BCP,
indicating a pronounced asymmetry with respect to the critical field. We
speculate that the small value of T_BCP is related to the geometric frustration
of the Kondo-lattice of YbAgGe.

gets updated with a probability that depends on the time since the last event

more robustly. Apart from that for the exogenous update rule and the standard

fused with in-falling oxidized condensate from the outer regions of the Solar

main-Belt asteroids, and veneer for the inner planets, especially Mars. In
response to decompression-driven planetary volume increases, cracks form to
increase surface area and mountain ranges characterized by folding form to
accommodate changes in curvature. The differences between the inner planets are

efficiency of searching, that is, they can hardly avoid obtaining partial
optimal solutions during searching process. Quantum annealing uses
delocalization and tunneling to avoid falling into local minima without
sacrifying execution time. It has been proved to be a promising way to many
optimization problems in recently published literatures. In this paper, for the
first time, QA based OSTP algorithms (QA_OSTP) is applied to the extraction of
the trustworthiest way. The experiment results show that QA based algorithms
have better performance than its heuristic opponents.

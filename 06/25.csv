interactions between 4f and conduction electrons lead to a hybridization gap
opening at low temperature 1-2. SmB6 is a typical KI, but its resistivity does
not diverge at low temperatures, which was attributed to some in-gap states
3-10. However after several decades of research, the nature and origin of the
in-gap states remain unclear. Recent band calculation and transport
measurements suggest that the in-gap states could actually be ascribed to
topological surface states. SmB6 thus might be the first realization of
topological Kondo insulator (TKI) 13, the strongly correlated version of
topological insulator (TI) 11,12. Here by performing angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we directly observed several dispersive
states within the hybridization gap of SmB6, which cross the Fermi level and
show negligible kz dependence, indicative of their surface origin. Furthermore,
the circular dichroism (CD) ARPES results of the in-gap states suggest the
chirality of orbital momentum, and temperature dependent measurements have
shown that the in-gap states vanish simultaneously with the hybridization gap
around 150 K. These strongly suggest their possible topological origin.

The symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase possesses half-integer
projective representations of the SO(3) group, while the trivial phase
possesses integer linear representations. In the present work, we implement
non-Abelian symmetries in the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)
method, allowing us to keep track of (and also control) the virtual bond
representations, and to readily distinguish the SPT phase from the trivial one
by evaluating the multiplet entanglement spectrum. In particular, using the
entropies $S^I$ ($S^H$) of integer (half-integer) representations, we can
define an entanglement gap $G = S^I - S^H$, which equals 1 in the SPT phase,
and $-1$ in the trivial phase. As application of our proposal, we study the
spin-1 models on various 1D and quasi-1D lattices, including the
bilinear-biquadratic model on the single chain, and the Heisenberg model on a
two-leg ladder and a three-leg tube. Among others, we confirm the existence of
an SPT phase in the spin-1 tube model, and reveal that the phase transition
between the SPT and the trivial phase is a continuous one. The transition point

In a previous work (Basan et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 158101 (2011)), we
demonstrated that an instability arising from viscous shear stresses caused by
the constant flow due to cell turnover in the epithelium could drive this

mechanical resistance of the stroma tend to maintain a flat interface, an
instability occurs for sufficiently large viscosity, cell-division rate and
thickness of the dividing region in the epithelium. Here, extensions of this
work are presented, where cell division in the epithelium is coupled to the
local concentration of nutrients or growth factors diffusing from the stroma.
This enhances the instability by a mechanism similar to that of the

can be considered as new distinguished coordinates on the space of knot
polynomials, analogous to the coefficients of alternative character expansion.
These new variables are decomposed in an especially simple way, when the
representation is embedded into a product of the fundamental ones. The fourth
grading recently proposed in arXiv:1304.3481, seems to be just a simple
redefinition of these new coordinates, elegant but in no way distinguished. If
so, it does not provide any new independent knot invariants, instead it can be
considered as one more testimony of the hidden differential hierarchy
(Z-expansion) structure behind the knot polynomials.

theory for the Dirac equation is employed to express the conductance of a

equal to the ballistic value $4e^2/\pi h$ for each disorder realization

Case I leads to stau lepton masses of around a 100 GeV, while in Case II, the

and DDMC to multigroup, velocity-dependent transport with the intent of
modeling neutrino dynamics in core-collapse supernovae. Densmore has also
formulated a multifrequency extension to the originally grey DDMC method. We
rigorously formulate IMC and DDMC over a high-velocity Lagrangian grid for
possible application to photon transport in the post-explosion phase of Type Ia
supernovae. This formulation includes an analysis that yields an additional
factor in the standard IMC-to-DDMC spatial interface condition. To our
knowledge the new boundary condition is distinct from others presented in prior
DDMC literature. The method is suitable for a variety of opacity distributions

analytic solution having static material, as well as with a manufactured
solution for moving material with structured opacities. Finally, we demonstrate

ignition (HCCI) engines have a narrow stable operating region defined by
complex control strategies such as exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and variable
valve timing among others. For such systems, it is important to identify the
operating envelope or the boundary of stable operation for diagnostics and
control purposes. Obtaining a good model of the operating envelope using
physics becomes intractable owing to engine transient effects. In this paper, a
machine learning based approach is employed to identify the stable operating
boundary of HCCI combustion directly from experimental data. Owing to imbalance
in class proportions in the data, two approaches are considered. A re-sampling
(under-sampling, over-sampling) based approach is used to develop models using
existing algorithms while a cost-sensitive approach is used to modify the
learning algorithm without modifying the data set. Support vector machines and
recently developed extreme learning machines are used for model development and
results compared against linear classification methods show that cost-sensitive
versions of ELM and SVM algorithms are well suited to model the HCCI operating
envelope. The prediction results indicate that the models have the potential to
be used for predicting HCCI instability based on sensor measurement history.

of angular momentum and disks in brown dwarfs. The observations clearly show
that brown dwarfs beyond ages of 10 Myr are exclusively fast rotators and do
not spin down with age. This suggests that rotational braking by magnetic winds
becomes very inefficient or ceases to work in the substellar regime. There is,
however, some evidence for braking by disks during the first few Myrs in the
evolution, similar to stars. Brown dwarf disks turn out to be scaled down
versions of circumstellar disks, with dust settling, grain growth, and in some
cases cleared out inner regions. The global disk properties roughly scale with
central object mass. The evolutionary timescales in substellar disks are
entirely consistent with what is found for stars, which may be challenging to
understand. Given these findings, it is likely that brown dwarfs are able to
form miniature planetary systems.

of whether there is a column density threshold for star formation within
molecular clouds. We have simulated a large number of different clouds, with
volume and column densities spanning a wide range of different values, using a
state-of-the-art model for the coupled chemical, thermal and dynamical
evolution of the gas. We show that star formation is only possible in regions
where the mean (area-averaged) column density exceeds $10^{21} \: {\rm
cm^{-2}}$. Within the clouds, we also show that there is a good correlation
between the mass of gas above a K-band extinction $A_{\rm K} = 0.8$ and the
star formation rate (SFR), in agreement with recent observational work.
Previously, this relationship has been explained in terms of a correlation
between the SFR and the mass in dense gas. However, we find that this
correlation is weaker and more time-dependent than that between the SFR and the
column density. In support of previous studies, we argue that dust shielding is
the key process: the true correlation is one between the SFR and the mass in
cold, well-shielded gas, and the latter correlates better with the column
density than the volume density.

not adapted to smooth covariance matrices of large dimensions such as $J \ge

Compared to existing techniques, these new algorithms are at least an order of
magnitude faster in high dimensions and drastically reduce memory requirements.
The new algorithms provide instantaneous (few seconds) smoothing for matrices

scalable R software for FACE. When incorporated into R package {\it refund},
FACE improves the speed of penalized functional regression by an order of
magnitude, even for data of normal size ($J <500$). We recommend that FACE be

necessarily introduces violations of unitarity in the evolution of states where
the particle number is not defined. For an interacting system, such unitarity
violations can cascade from the ultraviolet scale to the infrared in a ""short""
time. Hence, an effective field theory will be grossly inadequate for
describing multi-particle correlations and related observables, even far away
from the cut-off scale $\Lambda$. We furthermore argue that if the system is
strongly coupled at $\Lambda$, than its final state {\em in the Effective Field
Theory} (EFT) will appear as the highest entropy state if only low cumulants
and correlations of the EFT degrees of freedom are measured.
  Heuristically, this can serve as an explanation of how ""entropy"" is created

conclude by discussing how these considerations might provide a clue to the

U and V is called locally linearly dependent (in abbreviate form: LLD) when

argument, one sees that studying LLD operator spaces amounts to studying vector
spaces of matrices with rank less than the number of columns, or,
alternatively, vector spaces of non-injective operators.
  In this article, this insight is used to obtain classification results for
LLD spaces of small dimension or large essential range (the essential range
being the sum of all the ranges of the operators in S). We show that such
classification theorems can be obtained by translating into the context of LLD
spaces Atkinson's classification of primitive spaces of bounded rank matrices;
we also obtain a new classification theorem for such spaces that covers a range
of dimensions for the essential range that is roughly twice as large as that in
Atkinson's theorem. In particular, we obtain a classification of all
4-dimensional LLD operator spaces for fields with more than 3 elements

Garside groups is closed under some free products with cyclic amalgamated
subgroups. We deduce that every tree product of infinite cyclic groups is a
Garside group. Moreover, we study those cyclic HNN extensions of Garside groups
that are Garside groups as well. Using a theorem of Pietrowski, we conclude
this paper by stating that a non-cyclic one-relator group is Garside if and
only if its centre is nontrivial.

found excess extended gamma ray emission at the Galactic center (GC). Both,
annihilating dark matter (DM) or a population of $\sim 10^3$ unresolved
millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are regarded as well motivated possible
explanations. However, there is significant uncertainties in the diffuse
galactic background at the GC. We have performed a revaluation of these two
models for the extended gamma ray source at the GC by accounting for the
systematic uncertainties of the Galactic diffuse emission model. We also
marginalize over point source and diffuse background parameters in the region
of interest. We show that the excess emission is significantly more extended
than a point source. We find that the DM (or pulsars population) signal is
larger than the systematic errors and therefore proceed to determine the
sectors of parameter space that provide an acceptable fit to the data. We found
that a population of order a 1000 MSPs with parameters consistent with the
average spectral shape of Fermi-LAT measured MSPs was able to fit the GC excess
emission. For DM, we found that a pure $\tau^+\tau^-$ annihilation channel is
not a good fit to the data. But a mixture of $\tau^+\tau^-$ and $b\bar{b}$ with
a $\left<\sigma v\right>$ of order the thermal relic value and a DM mass of
around 20 to 60 GeV provides an adequate fit.

assignments of a propositional formula, is a problem of significant theoretical
and practical interest. Due to the inherent complexity of the problem,
approximate model counting, which counts the number of satisfying assignments
to within given tolerance and confidence level, was proposed as a practical
alternative to exact model counting. Yet, approximate model counting has been
studied essentially only theoretically. The only reported implementation of
approximate model counting, due to Karp and Luby, worked only for DNF formulas.
A few existing tools for CNF formulas are bounding model counters; they can
handle realistic problem sizes, but fall short of providing counts within given
tolerance and confidence, and, thus, are not approximate model counters.
  We present here a novel algorithm, as well as a reference implementation,
that is the first scalable approximate model counter for CNF formulas. The
algorithm works by issuing a polynomial number of calls to a SAT solver. Our
tool, ApproxMC, scales to formulas with tens of thousands of variables. Careful
experimental comparisons show that ApproxMC reports, with high confidence,
bounds that are close to the exact count, and also succeeds in reporting bounds
with small tolerance and high confidence in cases that are too large for
computing exact model counts.

for Derivative-Free Optimization which rely on locally approximating an
objective function by quadratic polynomial interpolation models, frequently
built from less points than there are basis components. Often, in practical
applications, the contribution of the problem variables to the objective
function is such that many pairwise correlations between variables are
negligible, implying, in the smooth case, a sparse structure in the Hessian
matrix. To be able to exploit Hessian sparsity, existing optimization
approaches require the knowledge of the sparsity structure. The goal of this
paper is to develop and analyze a method where the sparse models are
constructed automatically. The sparse recovery theory developed recently in the
field of compressed sensing characterizes conditions under which a sparse
vector can be accurately recovered from few random measurements. Such a
recovery is achieved by minimizing the l1-norm of a vector subject to the
measurements constraints. We suggest an approach for building sparse quadratic
polynomial interpolation models by minimizing the l1-norm of the entries of the
model Hessian subject to the interpolation conditions. We show that this
procedure recovers accurate models when the function Hessian is sparse, using
relatively few randomly selected sample points. Motivated by this result, we
developed a practical interpolation-based trust-region method using
deterministic sample sets and minimum l1-norm quadratic models. Our
computational results show that the new approach exhibits a promising numerical
performance both in the general case and in the sparse one.

observed to lead to shock waves whose regularization mechanism, dissipative or
dispersive, is being debated. While classical, dissipative shocks, as in gas
dynamics, develop a steep, localized shock front that translates at a
well-defined speed, dispersively regularized shocks are distinguished by an
expanding region of short wavelength oscillations with two speeds, those of the
leading and trailing edges. For typical UFG experimental conditions, the
theoretical oscillation length scale is smaller than the resolution of present
imaging systems so it is unclear how to determine the shock type from its
structure alone. Two experimental methods to determine the appropriate
regularization mechanism are proposed: measurement of the shock speed and
observation of a one-dimensional collision experiment with sufficiently tight
radial confinement.

PWNe, and detected a large number of PWNe candidates, all powered by young and
energetic pulsars. The wealth of multi-wavelength data available and the new
results provided by Fermi-LAT give us an opportunity to find new PWNe and to
explore the radiative processes taking place in known ones. The TeV gamma-ray
unidentifiedsources (UNIDs) are the best candidates for finding new PWNe. Using
45 months of Fermi-LAT data for energies above 10 GeV, an analysis was
performed near the position of 58TeV PWNe and UNIDs within 5deg of the Galactic
Plane to establish new constraints on PWNe properties and find new clues on the
nature of UNIDs. Of the 58 sources, 30 were detected, and this work provides
their gamma-rayfluxes for energies above 10 GeV. The spectral energy
distributions (SED) andupper limits, in the multi-wavelength context, also
provide new information on the source nature and can help distinguish between
emission scenarios, i.e. between classification as a pulsar candidate or as a
PWN candidate. Six new GeV PWNe candidates are described in detail and compared
with existing models. A population study of GeV PWNe candidates as a function

galactic nuclei (AGNs) considering two scenarios for the time evolution of the
ionizing sources. We find that HeII reionization takes place in a very
inhomogeneous fashion, through the production of well separated bubbles of the
ionized phase that subsequently percolate. Overall, the reionization process is
extended in time and lasts for a redshift interval Delta z>1. At fixed gas
density, the temperature distribution is bimodal during the early phases of
HeII reionization and cannot be described by a simple effective equation of
state. When HeII reionization is complete, the IGM is characterized by a
polytropic equation of state with index gamma~1.20. This relation is
appreciably flatter than at the onset of the reionization process (gamma=1.56)
and also presents a much wider dispersion around the mean. We extract HI and
HeII Ly-alpha absorption spectra from the simulations and fit Voigt profiles to
them. We find that the regions where helium is doubly ionized are characterized
by different probability density functions of the curvature and of the Doppler
b parameters of the HI Ly-alpha forest as a consequence of the bimodal
temperature distribution during the early phases of HeII reionization. The
column-density ratio in HeII and HI shows a strong spatial variability. Its
probability density function rapidly evolves with time reflecting the
increasing volume fraction in which ionizing radiation is harder due to the AGN
contribution. Finally we show that the number density of the flux-transmission
windows per unit redshift and the mean size of the dark gaps in the HeII
spectra have the potential to distinguish between different reionization

formation theory. It is an observable quantity that is determined by important
physical mechanisms during formation, namely the accretion shock structure, and
even more fundamentally, the basic formation mechanism (core accretion or
gravitational instability). We study the impact of the core mass on the
post-formation entropy and luminosity of young giant planets forming via core
accretion with a supercritical shock (cold accretion). For this, we conduct
self-consistently coupled formation and evolution calculations of giant planets
with masses between 1 and 12 Jovian masses and core masses between 20 and 120
Earth masses. We find that the post-formation luminosity of massive giant
planets is very sensitive to the core mass. An increase of the core mass by a
factor 6 results in an increase of the post-formation luminosity of a 10 Jovian
mass planet by a factor 120. Due to this dependency, there is no single well
defined post-formation luminosity for core accretion, but a wide range. For
massive cores (~100 Earth masses), the post-formation luminosities of core
accretion planets become so high that they approach those in the hot start
scenario that is often associated with gravitational instability. For the
mechanism to work, it is necessary that the solids are accreted before or
during gas runaway accretion, and that they sink deep into the planet. We make
no claims whether or not such massive cores can actually form in giant planets.
But if yes, it becomes difficult to rule out core accretion as formation
mechanism based solely on luminosity for directly imaged planets that are more
luminous than predicted for low core masses. Instead of invoking gravitational
instability as the consequently necessary formation mode, the high luminosity
could also be caused simply by a more massive core.

gas-property gradients and red central galaxies observed to exist in the cores
of galaxy clusters. Thermal conduction has been suggested as a mechanism that
can help bring simulations of cluster cores into better alignment with
observations by stabilizing the feedback processes that regulate gas cooling,
but this idea has not yet been well tested with cosmological numerical
simulations. Here we present cosmological simulations of ten galaxy clusters
performed with five different levels of isotropic Spitzer conduction, which
alters both the cores and outskirts of clusters, but not dramatically. In the
cores, conduction flattens central temperature gradients, making them nearly
isothermal and slightly lowering the central density but failing to prevent a
cooling catastrophe there. Conduction has little effect on temperature
gradients outside of cluster cores because outward conductive heat flow tends
to inflate the outer parts of the intracluster medium (ICM) instead of raising
its temperature. In general, conduction tends reduce temperature inhomogeneity
in the ICM, but our simulations indicate that those homogenizing effects would
be extremely difficult to observe in ~5 keV clusters. Outside the virial
radius, our conduction implementation lowers the gas densities and temperatures
because it reduces the Mach numbers of accretion shocks. We conclude that
despite the numerous small ways in which conduction alters the structure of
galaxy clusters, none of these effects are significant enough to make the
efficiency of conduction easily measurable unless its effects are more
pronounced in clusters hotter than those we have simulated.

hybridization between the localized Pr pseudo-spins and Ir conduction electrons
breaks some of the spatial symmetries, in addition to time-reversal regardless

While the signal is usually characterized as mu- and y-type distortion, a
smaller residual (non-y/non-mu) distortion can also be created at intermediate
redshifts 10^4 < z < 3 x 10^5. Here, we construct a new set of observables,
mu_k, that describes the principal components of this residual distortion. The
principal components are orthogonal to temperature shift, y- and mu-type
distortion, and ranked by their detectability, thereby delivering a compression
of all valuable information offered by the CMB spectrum. This method provides
an efficient way of analyzing the spectral distortion for given experimental

illustration, we discuss the analysis of the spectral distortion signatures

We then formulate a precise sense in which a single energy eigenstate of a
Hamiltonian can be adiabatically connected to a state of a non-interacting
Anderson insulator. We call such a state a many-body localized state and define
a many-body localized phase as one in which almost all states are many-body
localized states. We explore the possible consequences of this; the most
striking is an area law for the entanglement entropy of almost all excited
states in a many-body localized phase. We present the results of numerical
calculations for a one-dimensional system of spinless fermions. Our results are
consistent with an area law and, by implication, many-body localization for
almost all states and almost all regions for weak enough interactions and
strong disorder. However, there are rare regions and rare states with much
larger entanglement entropies. Furthermore, we study the implications that
many-body localization may have for topological phases and self-correcting
quantum memories. We find that there are scenarios in which many-body
localization can help to stabilize topological order at non-zero energy
density, and we propose potentially useful criteria to confirm these scenarios.

can reproduce galaxy clustering better than gravitationally bound haloes. This
indicates that Friends of Friends groups are more directly related to the
clustering of these regions than the bound particles of the overdensities. In
general we find that the reconstruction works at best to 5% accuracy: it
underestimates the bias for bright galaxies. This translates to an
overestimation of 50% in the halo mass when we use clustering to calibrate
mass. We also found a degeneracy on the mass prediction from the clustering
amplitude that affects all the masses. This effect is due to the clustering
dependence on the host halo substructure, an indication of assembly bias. We
show that the clustering of haloes of a given mass increases with the number of
subhaloes, a result that only depends on the underlying matter distribution. As
the number of galaxies increases with the number of subhaloes in SAMs, this
results in a low bias for the HOD reconstruction. We expect this effect to
apply to other models of galaxy formation, including the real universe, as long

expansion. If a relativistic elastic solid drove an inflationary stage in the
early Universe, quantum mechanically excited perturbations would arise in the
medium. We quantize the linear scalar and tensor perturbations and investigate
the observational consequences of having such an inflationary period. We find
that slowly varying sound speeds of the perturbations and a slowing varying
equation of state of the solid can produce a slightly red-tilted scalar power
spectrum that agrees with current observational data. Even in the absence of
nonadiabatic pressures, perturbations evolve on superhorizon scales, due to the
shear stresses within the solid. As such, the spectra of perturbations are in
general sensitive to the details of the end of inflation and we characterize
this dependence. Interestingly, we uncover here accelerating solutions for
elastic solids with (1 + P/\rho) significantly greater than 0 that nevertheless

electrostatic modeling we explore the effect that the switchable polarization
of electron-doped BaTiO3 (n-BaTiO3) has on the electronic properties of the
SrRuO3/n-BaTiO3 (001) interface. Ferroelectric polarization controls the
accumulation or depletion of electron charge at the interface, and the
associated bending of the n-BTO conduction band determines the transport regime
across the interface. The interface exhibits a Schottky tunnel barrier for one
polarization orientation, whereas an Ohmic contact is present for the opposite
polarization orientation, leading to a large change in interface resistance
associated with polarization reversal. Calculations reveal a large (five orders
of magnitude) change in the interface resistance as a result of polarization
switching.

Perturbations about a state of vertically uniform, laminar conduit flow are
considered in the context of the Navier-Stokes equations with appropriate

parameter used in the asymptotic analysis, which leads systematically to a
maximal balance between buoyancy driven, nonlinear self-steepening and viscous,
interfacial stress induced, nonlinear dispersion. This results in a scalar,
nonlinear partial differential equation describing large amplitude dynamics of
the cross-sectional area of the intrusive fluid conduit, in agreement with
previous derivations. The leading order behavior of the two fluid system is
completely characterized in terms of the interfacial dynamics. The regime of
model validity is characterized and shown to agree with previous experimental

spanning more than three magnitudes in stellar mass (~10^7-3x10^{10} Msun), we
trace the baryonic cycle of infalling gas from the virial radius through to its
participation in the star formation process. An emphasis is placed upon the
temporal history of chemical enrichment during its passage through the corona
and CGM. We derive the distributions of time between gas crossing the virial
radius and being accreted to the star forming region (which allows mixing
within the corona), as well as the time between gas being accreted to the star
forming region and then forming stars (which allows mixing within the disc).
Significant numbers of stars are formed from gas that cycles back through the
hot halo after first accreting to the star forming region. Gas entering high
mass galaxies is pre-enriched in low mass proto-galaxies prior to entering the
virial radius of the central progenitor, with only small amounts of primordial
gas accreted, even at high redshift (z~5). After entering the virial radius,
significant further enrichment occurs prior to the accretion of the gas to the
star forming region, with gas that is feeding the star forming region
surpassing 0.1Z by z=0. Mixing with halo gas, itself enriched via galactic
fountains, is thus crucial in determining the metallicity at which gas is
accreted to the disc. The lowest mass simulation (Mvir~2x10^{10}Msun, with
M*~10^7Msun), by contrast, accretes primordial gas through the virial radius
and onto the disc at all times. Much like the classical analytical solutions to
the `G-dwarf problem', overproduction of low-metallicity stars is ameliorated
by the inefficiency of star formation. Finally, gas outflow/metal removal rates
from star forming regions as a function of galactic mass are presented.

feature of being finite but regulator-dependent. While dimensional
regularization yields a result which respects the electromagnetic Ward
identities, additional terms which violate gauge invariance arise if the
calculation is done setting $d=4$. This discrepancy between the $d=4-\epsilon$
and $d=4$ results is recognized as a true ambiguity which must be resolved
using physics input; as dimensional regularization respects gauge invariance,
the $d=4-\epsilon$ calculation is accepted as the correct SM result. However,
here we point out another possibility; working in analogy with the gauge chiral
anomaly, we note that it is possible that the individual diagrams do violate
the electromagnetic Ward identities, but that the gauge-invariance-violating
terms cancel when all contributions to $H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$, both from
the SM and from new physics, are included. We thus examine the consequences of
the hypothesis that the $d=4$ calculation is valid, but that such a
cancellation occurs. We work in general renormalizable gauge, thus avoiding
issues with momentum routing ambiguities. We point out that the
gauge-invariance-violating terms in $d=4$ arise not just for the diagram
containing a SM $W^{\pm}$ boson, but also for general fermion and scalar loops,
and relate these terms to a lack of shift invariance in Higgs tadpole diagrams.
We then derive the analogue of ""anomaly cancellation conditions"", and find
consequences for solutions to the hierarchy problem. In particular, we find
that supersymmetry obeys these conditions, even if it is softly broken at an
arbitrarily high scale.

approximated as a point source within the beam. However, when sources are of
intermediate spatial extent, neither of these calibrations schemes is
appropriate and both the spatial response of the instrument and the source's
light profile must be taken into account and the coupling between them
explicitly derived. To that end, we derive the necessary corrections using an
observed spectrum of a fully extended source with the beam profile and the
source's light profile taken into account. We apply the derived correction to
several observations of planets and compare the corrected spectra with their
spectral models to study the beam coupling efficiency of the instrument in the
case of partially extended sources. We find that we can apply these correction
factors for sources with angular sizes up to \theta_{D} ~ 17"". We demonstrate
how the angular size of an extended source can be estimated using the

interstellar reddening. Equivalent widths were obtained by fitting asymmetric

between DIBs and reddening and by different behaviour in UV shielded ($\zeta$)
and non-shielded ($\sigma$) sightlines. A ratio of DIBs at 5780 \AA\ and~5797
\AA\ proved to be reliable enough to distinguish between two different
sightline types. Based on linear relations between DIB equivalent width and
reddening for $\sigma$ and $\zeta$ sightlines, we divide DIBs into type {\sc i}
(where both linear relations are similar) and type {\sc ii} (where they are
significantly different). Linear relation for $\zeta$ type sightlines always
show a higher slope and larger x-intercept parameter than the relation for
$\sigma$ sightlines. Scatter around the linear relation is reduced after the
separation, but it does not vanish completely. This means that UV shielding is
the dominant factor of the DIB equivalent width vs.\ reddening relation shape
for $\zeta$ sightlines, but in $\sigma$ sightlines other physical parameters
play a major role. No similar dependency on gas density, electron density or

OFDM-based optical network is a promising transmission option towards the goal

variety of bandwidth requirements and that in a fundamentally parallel fashion
with each sub-carrier utilizing a frequency slot at a lower rate than if serial
transmission was used. In this paper, we propose a novel parallel transmission

formulate an ILP optimization model based on integer linear programming, with
consideration of various constraints, including spectrum fragmentation,
differential delay and guard-band constraints. We also propose a heuristic
algorithm which can be applied when the optimization model becomes intractable.
The numerical results show the effectiveness and high suitability of elastic

water Cherenkov detectors sensitive to gamma rays and hadronic cosmic rays in
the energy band between 100 GeV and 100 TeV. The observatory will be used to
measure high-energy protons and cosmic rays via detection of the energetic
secondary particles reaching the ground when one of these particles interacts
in the atmosphere above the detector. HAWC is under construction at a site 4100
meters above sea level on the northern slope of the volcano Sierra Negra, which
is located in central Mexico at 19 degrees N latitude. It is scheduled for
completion in 2014. In this paper we estimate the sensitivity of the HAWC
instrument to point-like and extended sources of gamma rays. The source fluxes
are modeled using both unbroken power laws and power laws with exponential
cutoffs. HAWC, in one year, is sensitive to point sources with integral
power-law spectra as low as 5x10^-13 cm^-2 sec^-1 above 2 TeV (approximately 50
mCrab) over 5 sr of the sky. This is a conservative estimate based on simple
event parameters and is expected to improve as the data analysis techniques are
refined. We discuss known TeV sources and the scientific contributions that
HAWC can make to our understanding of particle acceleration in these sources.

Ideally, any two users would be able to connect regardless of the type of

two-photon interference. From a theoretical perspective, photons coming from
different origins can interfere with a perfect visibility, provided they are
made indistinguishable in all degrees of freedom. Previous experimental
demonstrations of such a scenario have been limited to photon wavelengths below
900 nm, unsuitable for long distance communication, and suffered from low
interference visibility. We report two-photon interference using two disparate
heralded single photon sources, which involve different nonlinear effects,
operating in the telecom wavelength range. The measured visibility of the
two-photon interference is 80+/-4%, which paves the way to hybrid universal
quantum networks.

Ostrogradsky's Hamiltonian for nonsingular Lagrangians with second derivatives.
The procedure employs the stationary phase approximation to obtain the limiting
change of the wave function per unit time. By way of introduction, the method
is applied anew to the case of nonsingular Lagrangians with only first
derivatives, but not necessarily quadratic in the velocities. A byproduct of
the calculation is an alternate derivation of the Legendre transformation of
taking general classical Lagrangians into Hamiltonians. In both the first and
second derivative cases, the outcome contains precisely the classical
Hamiltonian, which represents the so-called ""symbol"" of a (not necessarily
Hermitean) pseudodifferential operator acting on the wave function at an
instant of time. The derivation herein argues for a claim that Feynman's method
starts with a classical Lagrangian and ends with a classical
Hamiltonian---nonclassical operator-ordering prescriptions in the passage from
classical to quantum Hamiltonians require external input, and are generally not
inherent in Feynman's path integral formalism.

significant for nonparametric inference on non-Euclidean spaces. The first one,
Theorem 2.2, encompasses and improves upon most earlier CLTs on Fr\'echet means
and broadens the scope of the methodology beyond manifolds to diverse new
non-Euclidean data including those on certain stratified spaces which are
important in the study of phylogenetic trees. It does not require that the
underlying distribution $Q$ have a density, and applies to both intrinsic and
extrinsic analysis. The second theorem, Theorem 3.3, focuses on intrinsic means
on Riemannian manifolds of dimensions $d>2$ and breaks new ground by providing
a broad CLT without any of the earlier restrictive support assumptions. It
makes the statistically reasonable assumption of a somewhat smooth density of
$Q$. The excluded case of dimension $d=2$ proves to be an enigma, although the
first theorem does provide a CLT in this case as well under a support
restriction. Theorem 3.3 immediately applies to spheres $S^d$, $d>2$, which are
also of considerable importance in applications to axial spaces and to
landmarks based image analysis, as these spaces are quotients of spheres under
a Lie group $\mathcal G $ of isometries of $S^d$.

period of 3.89 d. This system exhibits a superorbital modulation with a period
varying between ~40 d and ~65 d. The instantaneous frequency and the
corresponding phase of the superorbital modulation can be obtained by a
recently developed time-frequency analysis technique, the Hilbert-Huang
transform (HHT). We present a phase-resolved analysis of both the spectra and
the orbital profiles with the superorbital phase derived from the HHT. The
X-ray spectra observed by the Proportional Counter Array onboard the Rossi
X-ray Timing Explorer are fitted well by a blackbody plus a Comptonized
component. The plasma optical depth, which is a good indicator of the
distribution of material along the line of sight, is significantly
anti-correlated with the flux detected at 2.5-25 keV. However, the relationship
between the plasma optical depth and the equivalent width of the iron line is
not monotonic: there is no significant correlation for fluxes higher than ~35
mCrab but clear positive correlation when the intensity is lower than ~20
mCrab. This indicates that the iron line production is dominated by different
regions of this binary system in different superorbital phases. To study the
dependence of the orbital profile on the superorbital phase, we obtained the
eclipse profiles by folding the All Sky Monitor light curve with the orbital
period for different superorbital states. A dip feature, similar to the
pre-eclipse dip in Her X-1, lying at orbital phase ~0.6-0.85, was discovered
during the superorbital transition state. This indicates that the accretion
disk has a bulge that absorbs considerable X-ray emission in the stream-disk
interaction region. The dip width is anti-correlated with the flux, and this
relation can be interpreted by the precessing tilted accretion disk scenario.

Glass Ib is highly variable, showing changes in continuum strength and emission

in a solidlike state follows the exponential distribution, whereas the
trapping-time distribution in local potential minima within the solidlike state
is not exponential. To confirm the exponential trapping-time distribution in a
solidlike state, we investigate water clusters, $($H${}_2$O$)_6$ and
$($H${}_2$O$)_{12}$, by molecular dynamics simulations. These clusters change
dynamically from solidlike to liquidlike state and vice versa. We find that the
probability density functions of trapping times in a solidlike state are
described by the exponential distribution whereas those of interevent times of
large fluctuations in potential energy within the solidlike state follow the
Weibull distributions. The results provide a clear evidence that transition
dynamics between solidlike and liquidlike states in water clusters are well
described by the SHN model, suggesting that the exponential trapping-time

R^N)$ solution $(v,p)$ with $|v|^2+ |p|\in L^{\frac{q}{2}}(\Bbb R^N)$, $q\in
(\frac{3N}{N-1}, \infty)$ is trivial, $v=0$. For the solution of of the steady
Navier-Stokes equations, satisfying $v(x)\to 0$ as $|x|\to \infty$, the
condition $\int_{\Bbb R^3} |\Delta v|^{\frac65} dx<\infty$, which is stronger
than the important D-condition, $\int_{\Bbb R^3} |\nabla v|^2 dx <\infty$, but
both having the same scaling property, implies that $v=0$. In the appendix we
reprove the Theorem 1.1(\cite{cha0}), using the self-similar Euler equations
directly.

Because this binary system has a known age, it is useful for testing the idea
that radius inflation can occur in short period binaries for stars with
significant convective envelopes due to the inhibition of energy transport by
magnetic fields. The brighter star in the binary also produces a precision

contains two almost indistiguishable stars. The other binary (V1) has a small

Specifically, we analyze how the artificial noise can achieve practical
secrecy. By treating the artificial noise as an unshared one-time pad secret
key, we show that the proposed scheme also achieves Shannon's perfect secrecy.
Moreover, we show that achieving perfect secrecy is much easier than ensuring
non-zero secrecy capacity, especially when the eavesdropper has more antennas

practical secrecy and strong secrecy can be guaranteed even if the eavesdropper
attempts to remove the artificial noise. We finally show the connections

firm is trying to recruit workers by offering a higher salary than its
competitors, and its production function defines the utility generated from any
actual set of recruited workers. We define two natural classes of production
functions for firms, where the first one is based on additive capacities
(weights), and the second on the influence of workers in a social network. We
then analyze the existence of pure subgame perfect equilibrium (PSPE) in the

substitutes condition, we show that in both classes the existence of PSPE is
guaranteed under certain restrictions, and in particular when there are only
two competing firms. As a corollary, there exists a Walrasian equilibrium in a
corresponding combinatorial auction, where bidders' valuation functions belong
to these classes.

us to study the global longtime behavior of the corresponding dynamical system.

be extremely complicated, especially if they are not facet-to-facet, that is,
if the facets of a cell do not necessarily coincide with the facets of that
cell's neighbours. In a recent paper (Weiss and Cowan, Adv.Appl.Prob. 2011), we
have developed a theory which covers these complicated cases, at least with
respect to their combinatorial topology. The theory required seven parameters,
three of which suffice for facet-to-facet cases; the remaining four parameters
are needed for the awkward adjacency concepts that arise in the general case.
This current paper establishes constraints that apply to these seven parameters
and so defines a permissible region within their seven-dimensional space, a
region which we discover is not bounded. Our constraints in the relatively
simple facet-to-facet case are also new.

photons in the presence of an external magnetic field. The energy range of
photons which undergo strong mixing with ALPs depends on the ALP mass, on its
coupling with photons as well as on the external magnetic field and particle
density configurations. Recent observations of blazars by the Fermi Gamma-Ray
Space Telescope in the 0.1-300 GeV energy range show a break in their spectra
in the 1-10 GeV range. We have modeled this spectral feature for the
flat-spectrum radio quasar 3C454.3 during its November 2010 outburst, assuming
that a significant fraction of the gamma rays convert to ALPs in the large
scale jet of this blazar. Using theoretically motivated models for the magnetic
field and particle density configurations in the kiloparsec scale jet, outside
the broad-line region, we find an ALP mass $m_a\sim (1-3)\cdot 10^{-7}$ eV and
coupling $g_{a\gamma} \sim (1-3)\cdot 10^{-10}$ GeV$^{-1}$ after performing an
illustrative statistical analysis of spectral data in four different epochs of
emission. The precise values of $m_a$ and $g_{a\gamma}$ depend weakly on the
assumed particle density configuration and are consistent with the current
experimental bounds on these quantities. We apply this method and ALP
parameters found from fitting 3C454.3 data to another flat-spectrum radio
quasar PKS1222+216 (4C+21.35) data up to 400 GeV, as a consistency check, and
found good fit. We find that the ALP-photon mixing effect on the GeV spectra
may not be washed out for any reasonable estimate of the magnetic field in the
intergalactic media.

may have an impact on their further evolution. In the frame of the cold disc

inside the star during its formation and what are the consequences for its
evolution on the main sequence (MS). Computation begins from a hydrostatic core
on the Hayashi line of 0.7 Msol at solar metallicity (Z=0.014) rotating as a
solid body. Accretion rates depending on the luminosity of the accreting object
are considered varying between 1.5e-5 and 1.7e-3 Msol/yr. The accreted matter
is assumed to have an angular velocity equal to that of the outer layer of the
accreting star. Models are computed for a mass-range on the zero-age main
sequence (ZAMS) between 2 and 22 Msol. We study how the internal and surface
velocities vary as a function of time during the accretion phase and the
evolution towards the ZAMS. Stellar models, whose evolution has been followed
along the pre-MS phase, are found to exhibit a shallow gradient of angular
velocity on the ZAMS. Interestingly, for masses on the ZAMS larger than 8 Msol,
there exists a maximum surface velocity that can be reached through the present
scenario of formation. Typically, for 14 Msol models, only stars with surface
velocities on the ZAMS lower than about 45% of the critical velocity can be
formed. To reach higher velocities would require to start from cores rotating
above the critical limit. We find that this upper velocity limit is smaller for
higher masses. In contrast, below 8 Msol, there is no restriction and the whole
domain of velocities, up to the critical one, can be reached.

flows is investigated in low luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs).
Theoretical studies show that a geometrically thin, optically thick disk is
truncated at mass accretion rates less than a critical value by mass evaporated
vertically from the disk to the corona, with the truncated region replaced by
an advection dominated accretion flow (ADAF). The critical accretion rate for
such a truncation is a function of the viscosity and magnetic field.
Observations of X-ray photon indices and spectral fits of a number of LLAGNs
published in the literature provide an estimate of the critical rate of mass
accretion and the truncation radius respectively. By comparing the
observational results with theoretical predictions, the viscosity and magnetic
field parameters in the hot accretion flow region are estimated. Specifically,
the mass accretion rates inferred in different sources constrain the viscosity
parameter, whereas the truncation radii of the disk, as inferred from spectral
fits, further constrain the magnetic field parameter. It is found that the
value of the viscosity parameter in the corona/ADAF ranges from 0.17 to 0.5,
with values clustered about 0.2-0.3. Magnetic pressure is required by the

dual of a generalised Gelfand--Graev representation of $G^F$ and $u \in G^F$ is

restrictions on $q$, the scalars relating the characteristic functions of
character sheaves of $G$ to the almost characters of $G^F$ whenever the support
of the character sheaf contains a unipotent element. We achieve this by
adapting a method of Lusztig who answered this question when $G$ is a special

which angular momentum is efficiently transported outwards in astrophysical
discs. However, its application to protoplanetary discs remains problematic.
These discs are so poorly ionised that they may not support magnetorotational
turbulence in regions referred to as `dead zones'. It has recently been
suggested that the Hall effect, a non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effect,
could revive these dead zones by enhancing the magnetically active column
density by an order of magnitude or more. We investigate this idea by
performing local, three-dimensional, resistive Hall-MHD simulations of the MRI
in situations where the Hall effect dominates over Ohmic dissipation. As
expected from linear stability analysis, we find an exponentially growing
instability in regimes otherwise linearly stable in resistive MHD. However,
instead of vigorous and sustained magnetorotational turbulence, we find that
the MRI saturates by producing large-scale, long-lived, axisymmetric structures
in the magnetic and velocity fields. We refer to these structures as zonal
fields and zonal flows, respectively. Their emergence causes a steep reduction
in turbulent transport by at least two orders of magnitude from extrapolations
based upon resistive MHD, a result that calls into question contemporary models
of layered accretion. We construct a rigorous mean-field theory to explain this
new behaviour and to predict when it should occur. Implications for
protoplanetary disc structure and evolution, as well as for theories of planet
formation, are briefly discussed.

The second one is a new approach that we introduce and is based on crossed

with results for other Fe-molecule clusters available in the literature.

computation is made using three parameterizations of cosmic ray spectra which
include the knee region. All calculations are compared with the atmospheric
neutrino measurements by Frejus and IceCube. The prompt neutrino flux
predictions obtained with thequark-gluon string model (QGSM) for the charm

flavor ratio, $\phi_{\nu_ mu}/\phi_{\nu_e}$, extracted from IceCube data
decreases in the energy range $0.1 - 5$ TeV energy contrary to that one might
expect from the conventional neutrino flux. Presumable reasons of such behavior
are: i) early arising contribution from decays of charmed particle, differing
from predictions of present models, ii) revealed diffuse flux of astrophysical
electron neutrinos. The likely diffuse flux of astrophysical neutrinos related
to the PeV neutrino events, detected in the IceCube experiment, leads to a
decrease of the flavor ratio at the energy below 10 TeV, that is in qualitative

rigorous limit process connecting finite dimensional optimal control problems
with ODE constraints modeling multi-agent interactions to an infinite
dimensional optimal control problem with a constraint given by a PDE of
Vlasov-type, governing the dynamics of the probability distribution of
interacting agents. While in the classical mean-field theory one studies the
behavior of a large number of small individuals {\it freely interacting} with
each other, by simplifying the effect of all the other individuals on any given
individual by a single averaged effect, we address the situation where the
individuals are actually influenced also by an external {\it policy maker}, and
we propagate its effect for the number $N$ of individuals going to infinity. On
the one hand, from a modeling point of view, we take into account also that the
policy maker is constrained to act according to optimal strategies promoting
its most parsimonious interaction with the group of individuals. This will be
realized by considering cost functionals including $L^1$-norm terms penalizing
a broadly distributed control of the group, while promoting its sparsity. On
the other hand, from the analysis point of view, and for the sake of
generality, we consider broader classes of convex control penalizations. In
order to develop this new concept of limit rigorously, we need to carefully
combine the classical concept of mean-field limit, connecting the finite
dimensional system of ODE describing the dynamics of each individual of the
group to the PDE describing the dynamics of the respective probability
distribution, with the well-known concept of $\Gamma$-convergence to show that
optimal strategies for the finite dimensional problems converge to optimal
strategies of the infinite dimensional problem.

for minimizing the sum of a smooth (possibly nonconvex) function and a
block-separable (possibly nonconvex nonsmooth) function. At each iteration,
this method randomly picks a block according to any prescribed probability
distribution and solves typically several associated proximal subproblems that
usually have a closed-form solution, until a certain progress on objective
value is achieved. In contrast to the usual randomized block coordinate descent
method [23,20], our method has a nonmonotone flavor and uses variable stepsizes
that can partially utilize the local curvature information of the smooth
component of objective function. We show that any accumulation point of the
solution sequence of the method is a stationary point of the problem {\it
almost surely} and the method is capable of finding an approximate stationary
point with high probability. We also establish a sublinear rate of convergence
for the method in terms of the minimal expected squared norm of certain
proximal gradients over the iterations. When the problem under consideration is
convex, we show that the expected objective values generated by RNBPG converge
to the optimal value of the problem. Under some assumptions, we further
establish a sublinear and linear rate of convergence on the expected objective
values generated by a monotone version of RNBPG. Finally, we conduct some
preliminary experiments to test the performance of RNBPG on the
$\ell_1$-regularized least-squares problem and a dual SVM problem in machine
learning. The computational results demonstrate that our method substantially
outperforms the randomized block coordinate {\it descent} method with fixed or

modified ones. We also take into account the quasielastic and inelastic

substantial increase of the $\omega$ width in the medium, reaching a value of
$129 \pm 10$ MeV at normal nuclear matter density for an $\omega$ at rest,
which comes mainly from $\omega N \to \pi \pi N, \omega N N \to \pi NN$
processes associated to the dominant $\omega \to \rho\pi$ decay mode. The value
of the width increases moderately with momentum, reaching values of around 200

resolution down to milliarcseconds on the occulted source even with
ground-based 1m class telescopes. LO observations are limited to brighter
objects because they require high signal to noise ratio (S/N ~ 40) for proper
extraction of angular diameter values. Hence, methods to improve the S/N ratio
by reducing noise using Fourier and Wavelet transforms have been explored in
this study. A sample of 54 near-infrared LO light curves observed with IR
Camera at Mt Abu observatory has been used. It is seen that both Fourier and
Wavelet methods have shown improvement in S/N, compared to the original data.
However, the application of wavelet transforms results in slight smoothening of
the fringes resulting in a higher angular diameter value. Fourier transforms
which reduce discrete noise frequencies do not distort the fringe. Fourier
transform method seems to be effective in S/N improvement, as well as improved
model fit particularly in the fainter regime of our sample. They also provide a
better model fit for brighter sources in some cases though there may not be
significant S/N improvement.

Experimental results show that the proposed transmitter is suitable for
implementation of the Bennett and Brassard 1984 (BB84), coherent one-way (COW)
and differential phase shift (DPS) protocols with stable and low quantum bit
error rate. This could become a useful component in network QKD, where
multi-protocol capability is highly desirable.

reaction threshold (E_{\gamma} = 1.1 GeV in the free nucleon kinematics) up to
1.5 GeV of incoming photon energy. For the first time both the radiative and
the three-pion decay channels are simultaneously investigated on the free

nucleus (AGN) on the mid- and far-infrared (IR) properties of galaxies as well
as the effects of simultaneous AGN and starburst activity in these same
galaxies. To do this we apply a multi-component, multi-band spectral synthesis
technique to a sample of 250 micron selected galaxies of the Herschel
Multi-tiered Extragalactic Survey, with IRS spectra available for all galaxies.
Our results confirm that the inclusion of the IRS spectra plays a crucial role
in the spectral analysis of galaxies with an AGN component improving the
selection of the best-fit hot dust model (torus). We find a correlation between
the obscured star formation rate (SFR) derived from the IR luminosity of the
starburst component, SFR_IR and SFR_PAH, derived from the luminosity of the PAH
features, L_PAH, with SFR_FIR taking higher values than SFR_PAH. The
correlation is different for AGN- and starburst-dominated objects. The ratio of
L_PAH to that of the starburst component, L_PAH/L_SB, is almost constant for
AGN-dominated objects but decreases with increasing L_SB for
starburst-dominated objects. SFR_FIR increases with the accretion luminosity,
L_acc, with the increase less prominent for the very brightest, unobscured
AGN-dominated sources. We find no correlation between the masses of the hot and
cold dust components. We interpret this as a non-constant fraction of gas
driven by the gravitational effects to the AGN while the starburst is ongoing.
We also find no evidence of the AGN affecting the temperature of the cold dust
component, though this conclusion is mostly based on objects with a
non-dominant AGN component. We conclude that our findings do not provide
evidence that the presence of AGN affects the star formation process in the
host galaxy, but rather that the two phenomena occur simultaneously over a wide
range of luminosities.

states are determined in the appropriate limit by two different polynomials
which can be identified as eigenstates of the dilatation operator in the
coordinate and momentum representations, respectively. We argue that, in virtue
of integrability of the dilatation operator, the two polynomials satisfy a
duality relation -- they are proportional to each other upon an appropriate
identification of momenta and coordinates. Combined with the conventional N=4
superconformal symmetry, this leads to the dual superconformal symmetry of the
dilatation operator. We demonstrate that this symmetry is powerful enough to
fix the eigenspectrum of the dilatation operator to the lowest order in the

dynamics is usually strongly affected by mechanical forces due to the strong

overcome by using dressed states that emerge from the microwave coupling of

sources: the inflaton and a spectator field, which is not dynamically important
during inflation but which after inflation can contribute to the curvature
perturbation. The recent Planck results on the power spectrum and
non-Gaussianity allow us to put constraints on such mixed models. In the
generic case, where no specific model for the inflaton or the spectator is
assumed, one finds that in the mixed scenario it is possible to have a large
trispectrum with tau_NL >> (f_NL)^2. The constraints on inflation models in the
plane of the spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio are modified by the
presence of a spectator and depend also on the ratio of the
spectator-to-inflaton power R. If one chooses the spectator to be the curvaton
with a quadratic potential, non-Gaussianities can be computed and imply
restrictions on possible values of R. We also consider a mixed curvaton and
chaotic inflation model and show that even quartic chaotic inflation is still
feasible in the context of mixed models.

Gaussian white noise field that has a hierarchical structure and the property
that the value of any part of the field can be computed quickly. Tiny
subregions of such a field can be used to set the phase information for
Gaussian initial conditions for individual cosmological simulations of
structure formation. This approach has several attractive features: (i) the
hierarchical structure based on an octree is particular well suited for
generating follow up resimulation or zoom initial conditions; (ii) the phases
are defined for all relevant physical scales in advance so that resimulation
initial conditions are, by construction, consistent both with their parent
simulation and with each other; (iii) the field can easily be made public by
releasing a code to compute it - once public, phase information can be shared
or published by specifying a spatial location within the realisation. In this
paper we describe the principles behind creating such realisations. We define
an example called PANPHASIA and in a companion paper on arXiv (Jenkins &
Booth), make public a code to compute it. With fifty octree levels Panphasia
spans a factor of more than 10^15 in linear scale - a range that significantly
exceeds the ratio of the current Hubble radius to the putative CDM
free-streaming scale. We show how to modify a code used for making cosmological

from Panphasia and, using this code, we demonstrate that it is possible to make
good quality resimulation initial conditions. We define a convention for
publishing phase information from Panphasia and publish the initial phases for

measures the relation of the number of distinct tilings to the number of

attention as presumably the simplest model that has not yet been solved exactly

Utility Pattern (HUP) Mining were used to find those activity patterns from the
collected sensor data. But applying the above technique for Activity
Recognition from the temporal sensor data stream is highly complex and
challenging task. So, a new approach is proposed for activity recognition from
sensor data stream which is achieved by constructing Frequent Pattern Stream
tree (FPS - tree). FPS is a sliding window based approach to discover the
recent activity patterns over time from data streams. The proposed work aims at
identifying the frequent pattern of the user from the sensor data streams which
are later modeled for activity recognition. The proposed FPM algorithm uses a
data structure called Linked Sensor Data Stream (LSDS) for storing the sensor
data stream information which increases the efficiency of frequent pattern
mining algorithm through both space and time. The experimental results show the
efficiency of the proposed algorithm and this FPM is further extended for
applying for power efficiency using HUP to detect the high usage of power

muon g-2 currently relies entirely on models. Measurements of the form factors
which describe the interactions of hadrons with photons can help to constrain
the models and reduce the uncertainty in a_{mu}(had. LbyL) = (116 \pm 40) x
10^{-11}. In the dominant pion-exchange contribution, the form factor
F_{{pi^0}^*gamma^*gamma^*}((q_1 + q_2)^2, q_1^2, q_2^2) with an off-shell pion
enters. In general, measurements of the transition form factor F(Q^2) =
F_{{pi^0}^*gamma^*gamma^*}(m_{pi}^2, -Q^2, 0) are only sensitive to a subset of
the model parameters. Thus, having a good description for F(Q^2) is only
necessary, not sufficient, to determine a_{mu}(LbyL; pi^0). Simulations have
shown that measurements at KLOE-2 should be able to determine the (pi^0 ->
gamma gamma) decay width to 1% statistical precision and the transition form
factor for small space-like momenta, 0.01 GeV^2 < Q^2 < 0.1 GeV^2, to 6%
precision. In the two-loop integral for the pion-exchange contribution the
relevant regions of momenta are in the range 0 - 1.5 GeV. With the (pi^0 ->
gamma gamma) decay width from the PDG [PrimEx] and current data for the
transition form factor, the error on a_{mu}(LbyL; pi^0) is (\pm 4 x 10^{-11})
[\pm 2 x 10^{-11}], not taking into account the uncertainty related to the
off-shellness of the pion. Including the simulated KLOE-2 data reduces the
error to (\pm (0.7 - 1.1) x 10^{-11}). For models like VMD, which have only few
parameters that are completely determined by measurements of F(Q^2), this
represents the total error. But maybe such models are too simplistic. In other
models, e.g. those based on large-N_c QCD, parameters describing the off-shell
pion dominate the uncertainty in a_{mu; large-N_c}(LbyL; pi^0) = (72 \pm 12) x
10^{-11}.

protect the confidentiality of respondents. When releasing microdata samples,
the risk that records can be identified must be assessed. To this aim, a widely
adopted approach is to isolate categorical variables key to the identification
and analyze multi-way contingency tables of such variables. Common disclosure
risk measures focus on sample unique cells in these tables and adopt parametric
log-linear models as the standard statistical tools for the problem. Such
models often have to deal with large and extremely sparse tables that pose a
number of challenges to risk estimation. This paper proposes to overcome these
problems by studying nonparametric alternatives based on Dirichlet process
random effects. The main finding is that the inclusion of such random effects
allows us to reduce considerably the number of fixed effects required to
achieve reliable risk estimates. This is studied on applications to real data,
suggesting, in particular, that our mixed models with main effects only produce
roughly equivalent estimates compared to the all two-way interactions models,
and are effective in defusing potential shortcomings of traditional log-linear
models. This paper adopts a fully Bayesian approach that accounts for all
sources of uncertainty, including that about the population frequencies, and
supplies unconditional (posterior) variances and credible intervals.

In reservoir computing, a dynamical core, called a reservoir, is perturbed with
an external input signal while a readout layer maps the reservoir dynamics to a
target output. Computation takes place as a transformation from the input space
to a high-dimensional spatiotemporal feature space created by the transient
dynamics of the reservoir. The readout layer then combines these features to
produce the target output. We show that coupled deoxyribozyme oscillators can
act as the reservoir. We show that despite using only three coupled
oscillators, a molecular reservoir computer could achieve 90% accuracy on a
benchmark temporal problem.

the charge density indicates a transfer of 0.4 electrons to each of the H-atoms
from both the Fe-atoms and from the copper substrate, irrespective of

Fe-atoms is reduced and mainly due to increased population of minority spin
d-states. This can be modeled by increased indirect coupling of d-states via
the conduction s-band in the Alexander-Anderson model.

thermonuclear supernovae has not been fully explored using comprehensive and
systematic studies with multiple models. To better constrain predictions of
yields from these phenomena, we have performed a sensitivity study by
post-processing thermodynamic histories from two different hydrodynamic,
Chandrasekhar-mass explosion models. We have individually varied all input
reaction and, for the first time, weak interaction rates by a factor of ten and
compared the yields in each case to yields using standard rates. Of the 2305
nuclear reactions in our network, we find that the rates of only 53 reactions
affect the yield of any species with an abundance of at least 10^-8 M_sun by at
least a factor of two, in either model. The rates of the 12C(a,g), 12C+12C,
20Ne(a,p), 20Ne(a,g) and 30Si(p,g) reactions are among those that modify the
most yields when varied by a factor of ten. From the individual variation of
658 weak interaction rates in our network by a factor of ten, only the stellar
28Si(b+)28Al, 32S(b+)32P and 36Ar(b+)36Cl rates significantly affect the yields
of species in a model. Additional tests reveal that reaction rate changes over
temperatures T > 1.5 GK have the greatest impact, and that ratios of
radionuclides that may be used as explosion diagnostics change by a factor of
less than two from the variation of individual rates by a factor of 10.
Nucleosynthesis in the two adopted models is relatively robust to variations in
individual nuclear reaction and weak interaction rates. Laboratory measurements
of a limited number of reactions would help to further constrain predictions.
As well, we confirm the need for a consistent treatment for relevant stellar
weak interaction rates since simultaneous variation of these rates (as opposed
to individual variation) has a significant effect on yields in our models.

type for 169 F, G, K, and M-type Kepler targets which were observed
spectroscopically from the ground with five different instruments. We use two

9693187 and 11179629 are discovered to be double-lined spectroscopic binary

stars the accuracy of present determinations of atmospheric parameters is +/-
150 K in Teff, +/- 0.15 dex in [Fe/H], and +/-? 0.3 dex in log g. Finally, we

Z[x,y,z] satisfying f(0,0,0)=0 and non-degenerated with respect to its Newton
polyhedron, we show that every pole of the local p-adic zeta function of f
induces an eigenvalue of the local monodromy of f at some point of the complex
zero locus of f close to the origin.
  Essentially the entire paper is dedicated to proving that, for f as above,
certain candidate poles of Igusa's p-adic zeta function of f, arising from
so-called B_1-facets of the Newton polyhedron of f, are actually not poles.
This turns out to be much harder than in the topological setting. The
combinatorial proof is preceded by a study of the integral points in
three-dimensional fundamental parallelepipeds. Together with the work of
Lemahieu and Van Proeyen, this main result leads to the Monodromy Conjecture
for the p-adic and motivic zeta function of a non-degenerated surface

the time-independent Schr\""odinger equation. The first concept begins with
rewriting the perturbation equations in a form that is closely related to
matrix diagonalization methods. That allows a simple, compact derivation of the
standard (Rayleigh-Schr\""odinger) equations. But it also leads to a new
iterative solution method that is not based on the usual power series
expansion. The iterative method can also be used when the unperturbed system is
two-fold degenerate. The second concept is quite different from the first but
compatible with it. It is based on the fact that one can replace the true
Hamiltonian with a synthetic Hamiltonian having the same eigenvalues. This
approach allows one to cancel part of the perturbation and to reduce the size
of the off-diagonal matrix elements, giving better convergence of the series.
These methods are illustrated by application to three perturbed harmonic
oscillator problems--a 1-D oscillator with a linear perturbation, a 1-D
oscillator with a quartic perturbation, and a perturbed 2-D oscillator, which
involves degenerate states. The iterative method and the synthetic Hamiltonian
method are shown to give significantly better results than the standard method.

standard material is often approximated by reflecting the Hugoniot in the
pressure-particle velocity (P-UP) plane. In cases where it has been tested
experimentally, this reflected shock approximation (RSA) has been found to be
fairly accurate at pressures as high as 100 GPa. The success of the RSA is
usually attributed to the lack of thermal effects, i.e., that the Hugoniot and
release adiabat are nearly identical in the pressure-density (P-rho) plane.
This report demonstrates that this explanation is not correct. The success of
the RSA does not arise from the absence of thermal effects--it arises because
of thermal effects. When the Hugoniot and adiabat are identical in the P-rho
plane, the adiabat lies below the reflected Hugoniot when mapped into the P-UP
plane. Material strength effects also cause the exact adiabat to lie below the
RSA. A thermal offset between the Hugoniot and the adiabat compensates for
these two effects, so that the RSA turns out to give good results for many
materials, even at high pressures. However, this fortuitous cancellation of
errors does not occur in all cases. This report shows that the RSA is not
accurate for two ""soft"" materials, Teflon and PMMA, and for a high-strength
material, tungsten. The issues discussed here apply to use of the RSA at low
pressures, not to very high pressures, where it is already well-known to be
inaccurate.

regarded as the ""typical"" or ""standard"" material response in the shock-wave
literature. It has even been proposed that this linearity follows from some
kind of universal equation of state (EOS) principle. This report presents a
theoretical analysis of this issue and a survey of the Hugoniot data for all
the elements. It demonstrates that linearity follows from the fact that US-UP
plots are rather insensitive to material properties, not from any universal
EOS. The effects of pressure and material properties on the shock response are
more easily seen and analyzed by plotting UF = US - UP as a function of UP. The
data survey shows that linear behavior is only observed in 20% of all the
elements and is not at all universal.

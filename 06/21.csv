  discs","submitted to MNRAS; version addressing ref comments",,"10.1093/mnras/stt1426",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is well known that massive protoplanetary disc are gravitationally
unstable beyond tens of AU from their parent star. The eventual fate of the
self-gravitating gas clumps born in the disc is currently not understood,
although the range of uncertainty is well known. If clumps migrate inward
rapidly, they are tidally disrupted, which may leave behind giant or
terrestrial like planets. On the other hand, if clumps migrate less rapidly,
they tend to accrete gas, becoming proto brown dwarfs or low mass companions to
the parent star. Here we argue that radiative feedback of contracting clumps
(protoplanets) on their discs is an important effect that has been overlooked
in previous calculations. We show analytically that temperature in clump's
vicinity may be high enough to support a quasi-static atmosphere if the clump
mass is below a critical value, $M_{\rm cr} \sim 6$ Jupiter masses ($M_J$).
This may arrest further gas accretion onto the clump and thus promote formation
of planets rather than low mass companions. We use numerical simulations to
evaluate these analytical conclusions by studying migration and accretion of
gas clumps as a function of their initial mass, $M_i$. Simulations neglecting
the radiative preheating effect show that gas clumps with mass less than $\sim
2 M_J$ migrate inward rapidly; more massive clumps result in low mass
companions. In contrast, simulations that include radiative preheating from the
clump show that clumps as massive as $8 M_J$ migrate inward rapidly and end up
tidally disrupted in the inner disc. We conclude that, with other parameters
being equal, previous simulations neglecting radiative feedback from
self-gravitating clumps over-estimated the population of brown dwarfs and low
mass stellar companions and under-estimated the population of planets.

proposed in the area of non-monotonic reasoning and logic programming, that has
been recently employed in many applications. The development of efficient ASP
systems is, thus, crucial. Having in mind the task of improving the solving
methods for ASP, there are two usual ways to reach this goal: $(i)$ extending
state-of-the-art techniques and ASP solvers, or $(ii)$ designing a new ASP
solver from scratch. An alternative to these trends is to build on top of
state-of-the-art solvers, and to apply machine learning techniques for choosing
automatically the ""best"" available solver on a per-instance basis.
  In this paper we pursue this latter direction. We first define a set of
cheap-to-compute syntactic features that characterize several aspects of ASP
programs. Then, we apply classification methods that, given the features of the
instances in a {\sl training} set and the solvers' performance on these
instances, inductively learn algorithm selection strategies to be applied to a
{\sl test} set. We report the results of a number of experiments considering
solvers and different training and test sets of instances taken from the ones
submitted to the ""System Track"" of the 3rd ASP Competition. Our analysis shows
that, by applying machine learning techniques to ASP solving, it is possible to
obtain very robust performance: our approach can solve more instances compared
with any solver that entered the 3rd ASP Competition. (To appear in Theory and

contemporary galaxy formation theory: (1) that large galaxies are known to
contain too little gas and stars and (2) that too few dwarf satellite galaxies
are observed around large galaxies compared with cosmological simulations. The
former can be explained by invoking some energetic process -- most likely AGN
or star formation feedback -- which expels to infinity a significant fraction
of the gas initially present in the proto-galaxy, while the latter problem is
usually explained by star formation feedback inside the dwarf or tidal and ram
pressure stripping of the gas from the satellite galaxy by its parent. Here we
point out that the host galaxy ""missing"" baryons, if indeed ejected at
velocities of hundreds to a thousand km s$^{-1}$, must also affect smaller
satellite galaxies by stripping or shocking the gas there. We estimate the
fraction of gas removed from the satellites as a function of the satellite
galaxy's properties. Applying these results to a Milky Way like dark matter
halo, we find that this singular shock ram pressure stripping event may be
quite efficient in removing the gas from the satellites provided that they are
close enough. We also use the orbital and mass modelling data for eight
Galactic dwarf spheroidal (dSph) satellites, and find that it is likely that
many of them have been affected by the Galactic outflow. We point out that
galactic outflows of the host may also trigger a starburst in the satellite
galaxies by over-pressuring their gas discs. This process may be responsible
for the formation of the globular clusters observed in some of the Milky Way's
dSphs (e.g. the Fornax and Sagittarius dSphs).

statistically significant confidence levels in NGC 104 (47 Tuc), NGC 1851, NGC

IA increases by Delta[Fe/H] ~ 0.03 dex toward the cluster outskirts. In the

RGB bump and the horizontal branch was recently shown to fade outward in 47 Tuc

Gaussian interference channel (GIC). In a two-user GIC, the rate pairs where
one user transmits its data at the single-user capacity (without interference),
and the other at the largest rate for which reliable communication is still
possible are called corner points. This paper relies on existing outer bounds
on the capacity region of a two-user GIC that are used to derive informative
bounds on the corner points of the capacity region. The new bounds refer to a
weak two-user GIC (i.e., when both cross-link gains in standard form are
positive and below 1), and a refinement of these bounds is obtained for the
case where the transmission rate of one user is within $\varepsilon > 0$ of the
single-user capacity. The bounds on the corner points are asymptotically tight
as the transmitted powers tend to infinity, and they are also useful for the
case of moderate SNR and INR. Upper and lower bounds on the gap (denoted by
$\Delta$) between the sum-rate and the maximal achievable total rate at the two
corner points are derived. This is followed by an asymptotic analysis analogous
to the study of the generalized degrees of freedom (where the SNR and INR
scalings are coupled such that $\frac{\log(\text{INR})}{\log(\text{SNR})} =
\alpha \geq 0$), leading to an asymptotic characterization of this gap which is
exact for the whole range of $\alpha$. The upper and lower bounds on $\Delta$
are asymptotically tight in the sense that they achieve the exact asymptotic
characterization. Improved bounds on $\Delta$ are derived for finite SNR and
INR, and their improved tightness is exemplified numerically.

control inputs and influence the states of the remaining follower agents. The
rate at which the follower agents converge to their desired states, as well as
the errors in the follower agent states prior to convergence, are determined by
the choice of leader agents. In this paper, we study leader selection in order
to minimize convergence errors experienced by the follower agents, which we
define as a norm of the distance between the follower agents' intermediate
states and the convex hull of the leader agent states. By introducing a novel
connection to random walks on the network graph, we show that the convergence
error has an inherent supermodular structure as a function of the leader set.
Supermodularity enables development of efficient discrete optimization
algorithms that directly approximate the optimal leader set, provide provable
performance guarantees, and do not rely on continuous relaxations. We formulate
two leader selection problems within the supermodular optimization framework,
namely, the problem of selecting a fixed number of leader agents in order to
minimize the convergence error, as well as the problem of selecting the
minimum-size set of leader agents to achieve a given bound on the convergence
error. We introduce algorithms for approximating the optimal solution to both
problems in static networks, dynamic networks with known topology
distributions, and dynamic networks with unknown and unpredictable topology
distributions. Our approach is shown to provide significantly lower convergence
errors than existing random and degree-based leader selection methods in a

sparse elliptical random design regression. For these problems, it is
intractable to calculate the global solution due to the nonconvex formulation.
In this paper, we propose an approximate regularization path-following method
for solving a variety of learning problems with nonconvex objective functions.
Under a unified analytic framework, we simultaneously provide explicit
statistical and computational rates of convergence for any local solution
attained by the algorithm. Computationally, our algorithm attains a global
geometric rate of convergence for calculating the full regularization path,
which is optimal among all first-order algorithms. Unlike most existing methods
that only attain geometric rates of convergence for one single regularization
parameter, our algorithm calculates the full regularization path with the same
iteration complexity. In particular, we provide a refined iteration complexity
bound to sharply characterize the performance of each stage along the
regularization path. Statistically, we provide sharp sample complexity analysis
for all the approximate local solutions along the regularization path. In
particular, our analysis improves upon existing results by providing a more
refined sample complexity bound as well as an exact support recovery result for
the final estimator. These results show that the final estimator attains an

With a sample of 3,850 groups with 13,655 satellite galaxies with high quality

using galaxy shape estimates optimized for weak lensing measurements. Our
radial alignment measurement increases to greater than 3-sigma significance
relative to the expectation for no alignments if we use 2-D S\'ersic model fits
to define galaxy orientations. Our weak measurement of radial alignments is in
conflict with predictions from dark matter N-body simulations, which we
interpret as evidence for large mis-alignments of baryons and dark matter in
group and cluster satellites. Within our uncertainties, that are dominated by
our small sample size, we find only weak and marginally significant trends of
the radial alignment angle distributions on projected distance from the group
centre, host halo mass, and redshift that could be consistent with a tidal
torquing mechanism for radial alignments. Using our lensing optimized shape
estimators, we estimate that intrinsic alignments of galaxy group members may
contribute a systematic error to the mean differential projected surface mass

gamma-rays, lasting less than ~2 s, whose origin is one of the great unsolved
questions of astrophysics today. While the favoured hypothesis for their
production, a relativistic jet created by the merger of two compact stellar
objects (specifically, two neutron stars, NS-NS, or a neutron star and a black
hole, NS-BH), is supported by indirect evidence such as their host galaxy
properties, unambiguous confirmation of the model is still lacking. Mergers of
this kind are also expected to create significant quantities of neutron-rich
radioactive species, whose decay should result in a faint transient in the days
following the burst, a so-called ""kilonova"". Indeed, it is speculated that this
mechanism may be the predominant source of stable r-process elements in the
Universe. Recent calculations suggest much of the kilonova energy should appear
in the near-infrared (nIR) due to the high optical opacity created by these
heavy r-process elements. Here we report strong evidence for such an event
accompanying SGRB 130603B. If this simplest interpretation of the data is
correct, it provides (i) support for the compact object merger hypothesis of

versus less massive, blue and star forming ones, and this dichotomy correlates
very well with the galaxies' morphological properties. Star--forming galaxies
show a broad variety of morphological features, including clumpy structures and
bulges mixed with faint low surface brightness features, generally
characterized by disky-type light profiles. Passively evolving galaxies, on the
other hand, very often have compact light distribution and morphology typical

extrasolar planets is well-described by the Beta distribution. Several
properties of the Beta distribution make it a powerful tool for this purpose.
For example, the Beta distribution can reproduce a diverse range of probability
density functions (PDFs) using just two shape parameters (a and b). We argue
that this makes it ideal for serving as a parametric model in Bayesian
comparative population analysis. The Beta distribution is also uniquely defined
over the interval zero to unity, meaning that it can serve as a proper prior
for eccentricity when analysing the observations of bound extrasolar planets.
Using nested sampling, we find that the distribution of eccentricities for 396
exoplanets detected through radial velocity with high signal-to-noise is
well-described by a Beta distribution with parameters a = 0.867+/-0.044 and b =
3.03+/-0.17. The Beta distribution is shown to be 3.7 times more likely to
represent the underlying distribution of exoplanet eccentricities than the next

the sigma=330 km/s giant elliptical ESO325-G004. The low redshift of the lens
(z_lens=0.035) results in arcs being formed at a small fraction of the
effective radius, (R_Ein ~ R_Eff/4). At such small radii, stars dominate the
lensing mass, so that lensing provides a direct probe of the stellar
mass-to-light ratio, with only small corrections needed for dark matter. The
redshift of the galaxy lensed by ESO325-G004 was unknown until now, so the
lensing mass was not securely determined. Using X-SHOOTER, we measure a secure
source redshift of z_src=2.141. Combined with the lensing configuration, this
yields a total mass inside the Einstein radius of (1.50+/-0.06) 10^11 M_sun. We
estimate the range of possible contribution of dark matter to the lensing mass,
using statistics from cosmological N-body simulations. Subtracting this
component yields a stellar M/L ratio for the lens of 3.14^+0.24_-0.42 (M/L)_sun
(in F814W band). Using VIMOS, we have also obtained very high-S/N spectroscopy
for the lens galaxy. The VIMOS data confirm that ESO325-G004 has a very old
stellar population. For a Kroupa IMF, the stellar population fit yields a
predicted stellar M/L ratio of 3.01+/-0.25 (M/L)_sun. Hence the mass
attributable to stars with this IMF is consistent with the lensing estimate. By
contrast, a Salpeter or heavier IMF is disfavoured at the 99.8% confidence
level. A ""heavyweight"" IMF, with a mass twice as large as the Kroupa case, is
firmly excluded. Such an IMF has been proposed for more distant elliptical
lenses, and also to explain strong dwarf-star spectral features, in particular
the NaI 8200-Ang doublet. A FORS2 far-red spectrum shows that this feature is
as strong in ESO325-G004 as it is in other high-sigma ellipticals, suggesting
tension between dwarf-star indicators and lensing-mass constraints for this
galaxy.

efficient assignment of virtual machines to physical host machines in a network
cloud, so that the number of occupied hosts is minimized.
  There are multiple types of arriving customers, where a customer's mean
service time depends on its type. There is an infinite number of servers.
Multiple customers can be placed for service into one server, subject to
general ""packing"" constraints. Service times of different customers are
independent, even if served simultaneously by the same server. Each new
arriving customer is placed for service immediately, either into a server
already serving other customers (as long as packing constraints are not
violated) or into an idle server. After a service completion, each customer
leaves its server and the system.
  We propose an extremely simple and easily implementable customer placement
algorithm, called Greedy-Random (GRAND). It places each arriving customer
uniformly at random into either one of the already occupied servers (subject to
packing constraints) or one of the so-called zero-servers, which are empty
servers designated to be available to new arrivals. One instance of GRAND,
called GRAND($aZ$), where $a\ge 0$ is a parameter, is such that the number of
zero-servers at any given time $t$ is $aZ(t)$, where $Z(t)$ is the current
total number of customers in the system. We prove that GRAND($aZ$) with $a>0$
is asymptotically optimal, as the customer arrival rates grow to infinity and
$a\to 0$, in the sense of minimizing the total number of occupied servers in
steady state. In addition, we study by simulations various versions of GRAND
and observe the dependence of convergence speed and steady-state performance on
the number of zero-servers.

contains hot and highly deflected ion flows and rather low and turbulent
magnetic field. In this paper, we report first observations of HFA-like events

orbital phase of the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and

current sheets magnetically connected to Mercury's bow shock. We show that some
of these events exhibit unambiguous magnetic and particle signatures of HFAs
similar to those observed earlier at other planets, and present their key
physical characteristics. Our analysis suggests that Mercury's bow shock does
not only mediate the flow of supersonic solar wind plasma but also provides
conditions for local particle acceleration and heating as predicted by previous
numerical simulations. Together with earlier observations of HFA activity at

distribution of a dynamic routing model on a network. In this model, there are
$n$ nodes, each pair joined by a link of capacity $C$. For each pair of nodes,
calls arrive for this pair of endpoints as a Poisson process with rate
$\lambda$. A call for endpoints $\{u,v\}$ is routed directly onto the link
between the two nodes if there is spare capacity; otherwise $d$ two-link paths
between $u$ and $v$ are considered, and the call is routed along a path with
lowest maximum load, if possible. The duration of each call is an exponential
random variable with unit mean. In the case $d=1$, it was suggested by Gibbens,
Hunt and Kelly in 1990 that the equilibrium of this process is related to the
fixed points of a certain equation. We show that this is indeed the case, for
every $d \ge 1$, provided the arrival rate $\lambda$ is either sufficiently
small or sufficiently large. In either regime, we show that the equation has a
unique fixed point, and that, in equilibrium, for each $j$, the proportion of
links at each node with load $j$ is strongly concentrated around the $j$th
coordinate of the fixed point.

the competing interactions, a strong tendency toward unanimity emerges from the

voting patterns are organized in a relatively simple ""energy landscape,""

  not seen in the published version",,,,"cs.ET","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The 2-Handed Assembly Model (2HAM) is a tile-based self-assembly model in
which, typically beginning from single tiles, arbitrarily large aggregations of
static tiles combine in pairs to form structures. The Signal-passing Tile
Assembly Model (STAM) is an extension of the 2HAM in which the tiles are
dynamically changing components which are able to alter their binding domains
as they bind together. For our first result, we demonstrate useful techniques
and transformations for converting an arbitrarily complex STAM$^+$ tile set
into an STAM$^+$ tile set where every tile has a constant, low amount of
complexity, in terms of the number and types of ``signals'' they can send, with
a trade off in scale factor.
  Using these simplifications, we prove that for each temperature $\tau>1$
there exists a 3D tile set in the 2HAM which is intrinsically universal for the
class of all 2D STAM$^+$ systems at temperature $\tau$ (where the STAM$^+$ does
not make use of the STAM's power of glue deactivation and assembly breaking, as
the tile components of the 2HAM are static and unable to change or break
bonds). This means that there is a single tile set $U$ in the 3D 2HAM which
can, for an arbitrarily complex STAM$^+$ system $S$, be configured with a
single input configuration which causes $U$ to exactly simulate $S$ at a scale
factor dependent upon $S$. Furthermore, this simulation uses only two planes of
the third dimension. This implies that there exists a 3D tile set at
temperature $2$ in the 2HAM which is intrinsically universal for the class of
all 2D STAM$^+$ systems at temperature $1$. Moreover, we show that for each
temperature $\tau>1$ there exists an STAM$^+$ tile set which is intrinsically
universal for the class of all 2D STAM$^+$ systems at temperature $\tau$,
including the case where $\tau = 1$.

white Gaussian host signal in a power-constrained manner to encode a message,
and the decoder recovers both the embedded message and the modified host
signal. This partially extends the recent work of Sumszyk and Steinberg to the
continuous-alphabet Gaussian setting. Through a control-theoretic lens, we
observe that the problem is a minimalist example of what is called the ""triple
role"" of control actions. We show that a dirty-paper-coding strategy achieves
the optimal rate for perfect recovery of the modified host and the message for
any message rate. For imperfect recovery of the modified host, by deriving
bounds on the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) in recovering the modified host
signal, we show that DPC-based strategies are guaranteed to attain within a
uniform constant factor of 16 of the optimal weighted sum of power required in
host signal modification and the MMSE in the modified host signal
reconstruction for all weights and all message rates. When specialized to the
zero-rate case, our results provide the tightest known lower bounds on the
asymptotic costs for the vector version of a famous open problem in
decentralized control: the Witsenhausen counterexample. Numerically, this
tighter bound helps us characterize the asymptotically optimal costs for the

strongly in L^2 to a shear flow which is also close to the Couette flow. The
vorticity is asymptotically driven to small scales by a linear evolution and
weakly converges as $t \rightarrow \pm\infty$. The strong convergence of the
velocity field is sometimes referred to as inviscid damping, due to the

theory of elastic plates, we derive a Kirchhoff rod model for the folded strip.
A non-linear effective constitutive law incorporating the underlying
geometrical constraints is derived, in which the angle the ridge appears as an
internal degree of freedom. By contrast with traditional thin- walled beam
models, this constitutive law captures large, non-rigid deformations of the
cross-sections, including finite variations of the dihedral angle at the ridge.
Using this effective rod theory, we identify a buckling instability that
produces the out-of-plane configurations of the folded strip, and show that the
strip behaves as an elastic ring having one frozen mode of curvature. In
addition, we point out two novel buckling patterns: one where the centerline
remains planar and the ridge angle is modulated; another one where the bending
deformation is localized. These patterns are observed experimentally, explained

frame operators admit a Walnut-like representation, i.e. the operator acting on
a function can be described by weighted translates of that function, even when
the original frame operator is not diagonal. In this case, which only occurs
when compactly supported window functions are used, the canonical dual frame
partially inherits the structure of the original frame, with differences that
we describe in detail. Moreover, we determine a sufficient condition for a pair
of nonstationary Gabor frames to form dual frames. The equivalence of this
condition to the duality of the involved systems is shown under some weak
restrictions. It is then applied in a simple setup, to prove the existence of
dual pairs of nonstationary Gabor systems with non-diagonal frame operator.

build the chargeless complex vector superpartner where the respective field
strength transforms as matter fields by a global $U(1)$ gauge symmetry. To the
aim to deal with consistent terms without breaking the global $U(1)$ symmetry
it imposes a choice to the complex combination revealing a kind of symmetry
between the choices and eliminate the extra degrees of freedom consistently

contributes as a complement to dynamics of the model. We obtain the equations

enhance the amount of light detected is essential for greater scientific
achievements. One challenge in using radio transmittable apertures is keeping
the detectors cool. This is because transparency to thermal radiation above the
radio frequency range increases the thermal load. A technology that maintains
cold conditions while allowing larger apertures has been long-awaited. We
propose radio-transparent multi-layer insulation (RT-MLI), composed from a set
of stacked insulating layers. The insulator is transparent to radio
frequencies, but not transparent to infrared radiation. The basic idea for
cooling is similar to conventional multi-layer insulation. It leads to a
reduction in thermal radiation while maintaining a uniform surface temperature.
The advantage of this technique over other filter types is that no thermal
links are required. As insulator material, we used foamed polystyrene; its low
index of refraction makes an anti-reflection coating unnecessary. We measured
the basic performance of RT-MLI to confirm that thermal loads are lowered with
more layers. We also confirmed that our RT-MLI has high transmittance to
radiowaves, but blocks infrared radiation. For example, RT-MLI with 12 layers
has a transmittance greater than 95% (lower than 1%) below 200 GHz (above 4
THz). We demonstrated its effects in a system with absorptive-type filters,
where aperture diameters were 200 mm. Low temperatures were successfully
maintained for the filters. We conclude that this technology significantly
enhances the cooling of radiowave receivers, and is particularly suitable for
large-aperture systems. This technology is expected to be applicable to various
fields, including radio astronomy, geo-environmental assessment, and radar
systems.

(resp., total vector domination) is the problem of finding a minimum
$S\subseteq V$ such that every vertex $v$ in $V\setminus S$ (resp., in $V$) has
at least $d(v)$ neighbors in $S$. The (total) vector domination is a
generalization of many dominating set type problems, e.g., the dominating set

been studied under this general framework. In this paper, we show that a
(total) vector domination of graphs with bounded branchwidth can be solved in
polynomial time. This implies that the problem is polynomially solvable also
for graphs with bounded treewidth. Consequently, the (total) vector domination
problem for a planar graph is subexponential fixed-parameter tractable with

which consist of intensive and extensive search modes. Models of composite
search can generate predictions about how optimal foragers should behave in
each search mode, and how they should determine when to switch between search
modes. Most of these models assume that foragers use resource encounters to
decide when to switch between search modes. Empirical observations indicate
that a variety of organisms use non-directional sensory cues to identify areas
that warrant intensive search. These cues are not precise enough to allow a
forager to directly orient itself to a resource, but can be used as a criterion
to determine the appropriate search mode. As a potential example, a forager
might use olfactory information, which could help it determine if an area is
worth searching carefully. We developed a model of composite search based on
non-directional sensory cues. With simulations, we compared the search
efficiencies of composite foragers that use resource encounters as their
mode-switching criterion with those that use non-directional sensory cues. We
identified optimal search patterns and mode-switching criteria on a variety of
resource distributions, characterized by different levels of resource
aggregation and density. On all resource distributions, foraging strategies
based on the non-directional sensory criterion were more efficient than those
based on the resource encounter criterion. Strategies based on the
non-directional sensory criterion were also more robust to changes in resource
distribution. Our results suggest that current assumptions about the role of
resource encounters in models of optimal composite search should be
re-examined. The search strategies predicted by our model can help bridge the
gap between random search theory and traditional patch-use foraging theory.

sub-optimal for larger field sizes. The purpose of this study was to
investigate the incident electron beam distributions that would produce flat
FFF beams without the use of flattening filter. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations
with BEAMnrc and DOSXYZnrc codes have been performed to evaluate the
feasibility of this approach. The dose distributions in water for open 6MV
beams were simulated using Varian 21EX linac head model, which will be called
flattening filter (FF) model. Flattening filter has then been removed from FF
model, and MC simulations were performed using (1) 6 MeV electrons incident on
the target, (2) 6 MeV electron beam with electron angular distributions
optimized to provide as flat dose profiles as possible. Configuration (1)
represents FFF beam while configuration (2) allowed producing a flat FFF (F4)
beam. Optimizations have also been performed to produce flattest profiles for a
set of dose rates (DRs) in the range from 1.25 to 2.4 of the DR of FF beam.
Profiles and percentage depth doses PDDs from 6MV F4 beams have been calculated
and compared to those from FF beam. Calculated profiles demonstrated improved
flatness of the FFF beams. In fact, up to field sizes within the circle of 35
cm diameter the flatness of F4 beam at dmax was better or comparable to that of
FF beam. At 20 cm off-axis the dose increased from 52% for FFF to 92% for F4
beam. Also, profiles of F4 beams did not change considerably with depth, and
for large fields out-of-field dose was reduced by about a factor of two
compared to FF beam. PDDs from F4 beams were similar to those of FFF beam. The
DR for the largest modeled (44 cm diameter) F4 beam was higher than the DR from
FF beam by a factor of 1.25. It was shown that the DR can be increased while
maintaining beam flatness, but at the cost of reduced field size.

veneris population from Cyprus. All loci could be amplified successfully and
displayed allele size and diversity patterns that match those of oak species
belonging to the section Robur. At least in one case, limited amplification and
high levels of homozygosity support the occurrence of 'null alleles', caused by
a possible mutation in the highly conserved primer areas, thus hindering PCR.
The sampled population exhibited high levels of diversity despite the very
limited distribution of this species in Cyprus and extended population
fragmentation. Allele sizes of Q. infectoria at locus QpZAG9 partially match
those of Q. alnifolia and Q. coccifera from neighboring populations. However,
sequencing showed homoplasy, excluding a case of interspecific introgression
with the latter, phylogenetically remote species. Q. infectoria ssp. veneris
sequences at this locus were concordant to those of other species of section
Robur, while sequences of Quercus alnifolia and Quercus coccifera were almost
identical to Q. cerris.

discrete time linear regulator problems are restricted in their application to
problems with quadratic terminal payoffs. Where non-quadratic terminal payoffs
are required, these techniques fail due to the attendant non-quadratic value
functions involved. In order to compute these non-quadratic value functions, it
is often necessary to appeal directly to dynamic programming in the form of
grid- or element-based iterations for the value function. These iterations
suffer from poor scalability with respect to problem dimension and time
horizon. In this paper, a new max-plus based method is developed for the
approximate solution of discrete time linear regulator problems with
non-quadratic payoffs. This new method is underpinned by the development of new
fundamental solutions to such linear regulator problems, via max-plus duality.
In comparison with a typical grid-based approach, a substantial reduction in
computational effort is observed in applying this new max-plus method. A number
of simple examples are presented that illustrate this and other observations.

major source of noise in systems such as nano-mechanical oscillators, single
electron transistors, and superconducting qubits. Occurance of defect tunneling
despite their coupling to phonons is viewed as a hallmark of weak defect-phonon
coupling. This is since strong coupling to phonons results in significant
phonon dressing and suppresses tunneling in two-level tunneling defects
effectively. Here we determine the dynamics of a crystalline tunnelling defect
strongly coupled to phonons incorporating the full 3D geometry in our
description. We find that inversion symmetric tunnelling is not dressed by
phonons whereas other tunnelling pathways are dressed by phonons and, thus, are
suppressed by strong defect-phonon coupling. We provide the linear acoustic and
dielectric response functions for a crystalline tunnelling defect for strong
defect-phonon coupling. This allows direct experimental determination of the
defect-phonon coupling. The singling out of inversion-symmetric tunneling
states in single tunneling defects is complementary to their dominance of the
low energy excitations in strongly disordered solids as a result of
inter-defect interactions for large defect concentrations. This suggests that
inversion symmetric two-level systems play a unique role in the low energy
properties of disordered solids.

long-range temporal correlations in time series. Signals with long-range
temporal correlations are typically defined as having a power law decay in
their autocorrelation function. The output of DFA is an exponent, which is the
slope obtained by linear regression of a log-log fluctuation plot against
window size. However, if this fluctuation plot is not linear, then the
underlying signal is not self-similar, and the exponent has no meaning. There
is currently no method for assessing the linearity of a DFA fluctuation plot.
Here we present such a technique, called ML-DFA. We scale the DFA fluctuation
plot to construct a likelihood function for a set of alternative models
including polynomial, root, exponential, logarithmic and spline functions. We
use this likelihood function to determine the maximum likelihood and thus to
calculate values of the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria, which
identify the best fit model when the number of parameters involved is taken
into account and over-fitting is penalised. This ensures that, of the models
that fit well, the least complicated is selected as the best fit. We apply
ML-DFA to synthetic data from FARIMA processes and sine curves with DFA
fluctuation plots whose form has been analytically determined, and to
experimentally collected neurophysiological data. ML-DFA assesses whether the
hypothesis of a linear fluctuation plot should be rejected, and thus whether
the exponent can be considered meaningful. We argue that ML-DFA is essential to
obtaining trustworthy results from DFA.

laboratory (LNGS) of INFN is searching for neutrinoless double beta decay of
76Ge. The signature of the signal is a monoenergetic peak at 2039 keV, the
Q-value of the decay, Q_bb. To avoid bias in the signal search, the present
analysis does not consider all those events, that fall in a 40 keV wide region
centered around Q_bb. The main parameters needed for the neutrinoless double
beta decay analysis are described. A background model was developed to describe
the observed energy spectrum. The model contains several contributions, that
are expected on the basis of material screening or that are established by the
observation of characteristic structures in the energy spectrum. The model
predicts a flat energy spectrum for the blinding window around Q_bb with a
background index ranging from 17.6 to 23.8*10^{-3} counts/(keV kg yr). A part
of the data not considered before has been used to test if the predictions of
the background model are consistent. The observed number of events in this
energy region is consistent with the background model. The background at Q-bb
is dominated by close sources, mainly due to 42K, 214Bi, 228Th, 60Co and alpha
emitting isotopes from the 226Ra decay chain. The individual fractions depend
on the assumed locations of the contaminants. It is shown, that after removal
of the known gamma peaks, the energy spectrum can be fitted in an energy range
of 200 kev around Q_bb with a constant background. This gives a background
index consistent with the full model and uncertainties of the same size.

$V(\phi)=V_0\phi^N$. Using the dynamical system method, we analyze all possible
asymptotical regimes of the model under investigation and show that for sloping
potentials with $0<N<2$ there exists a quasi-de Sitter asymptotic
$H={1}/{\sqrt{9\kappa}}$ corresponding to an early inflationary Universe. In
contrast to the standard inflationary scenario, the kinetic coupling inflation
does not depend on a scalar field potential and is only determined by the
coupling parameter $\kappa$. We obtain that there exist two different late-time
asymptotical regimes. The first one leads to the usual power-like cosmological
evolution with $H=1/3t$, while the second one represents the late-time
inflationary Universe with $H=1/\sqrt{3\kappa}$. This secondary inflationary
phase depends only on $\kappa$ and is a specific feature of the model with
nonminimal kinetic coupling. Additionally, an asymptotical analysis shows that
for the quadric potential with N=2 the asymptotical regimes remain
qualitatively the same, while the kinetic coupling inflation is impossible for
steep potentials with N>2. Using a numerical analysis, we also construct exact
cosmological solutions and find initial conditions leading to the initial
kinetic coupling inflation followed either by a ""graceful"" oscillatory exit or
by the secondary inflation.

important goal of this design is that the radiation wavelength can be easily
tuned in a broad range (70-170 nm). In the light of the users' demand and our
actual conditions, the self-seeding scheme is adopted for this proposal.
Firstly, we attempt fixing the electron energy and only changing the undulator
gap to varying the radiation wavelength, but the analysis implies that it is
difficult because of the great difference of the power gain length and FEL
efficiency at different wavelength. Therefore, dividing the wavelength range
into three subareas is considered. In each subarea, a constant electron energy
is used and the wavelength tuning is realized only by adjusting the undulator
gap. The simulation results shows that this scheme has an acceptable
performance.

subjected to stresses. To investigate these processes in a simple geometry, we
use a model self-assembled transient gel and study the instability patterns
obtained in a radial Hele-Shaw cell when a low viscosity oil pushes the more
viscous transient gel. Thanks to an analysis of the morphology of the patterns,
we find a discontinuous transition between the standard Saffman-Taylor
fingering instability and a fracturing instability as the oil injection rate
increases. Our data suggest that the flow properties of the gel ahead of the
finger tip controls the transition towards fracturing. By analyzing the
displacement field of the gel in the vicinity of the fingers and cracks, we
show that in the fingering regime, the oil gently pushes the gel, whereas in
the fracturing regime, the crack tears apart the gel, resulting in a strong

scavengers in and around human settlements. They rarely hunt and consequently
do not encounter rich sources of protein. Instead they have adapted to a diet
of primarily carbohydrates. As descendants of the exclusively carnivorous
wolves, they are subjected to the evolutionary load of a physiological demand
for proteins. To meet their protein needs they resort to a thumb rule, if it
smells like meat, eat it. Pups face high competition from group and non group
members and are in a phase of rapid growth with high protein demands. Following
the thumb rule, then they can acquire more protein at the cost of increased
competition and reduced supplementary non protein nutrition. However, if the
mother supplements their diet with protein rich regurgitates and milk, then the
pups can benefit by being generalists. Using a choice test in the field we show
that while adults have a clear preference for meat, pups have no such
preference, and they even eat degraded protein eagerly. Thus the thumb rule
used by adult dogs for efficient scavenging is not innate, and needs to be
learned. The thumb rule might be acquired by cultural transmission, through
exposure to meat in the regurgitate of the mother, or while accompanying her on
foraging trips.

light curves are composed of 443 independent epochs, and show strong intrinsic
quasar variability, with an amplitude of the order of 0.2 magnitudes. From this
data, we measure the time delay using five different methods, all relying on
distinct approaches. One of these techniques is a new development presented in
this paper. All our time-delay measurements are perfectly compatible. By
combining them, we conclude that image A is leading B by 119.3 +/- 3.3 days (1

recently that such accurate time-delay measurements offer a highly

exons did; especially of digital signal processing researchers. Thus, we focus
on analysis of the C.elegans introns. In this paper, we propose the complex
Morlet wavelet analysis to investigate introns' characterization in the
C.elegans genes. However, catching the change in frequency response with
respect to time of the gene sequences is hindered by their presence in the form
of strings of characters. This can only be counteracted by assigning numerical
values to each of the DNA characters. This operation defines the so called ""DNA

sequences is uniquely captured by the ""ancestral recombination graph"" (ARG), a
complete record of coalescence and recombination events in the history of the
sample. However, existing methods for ARG inference are computationally
intensive, highly approximate, or limited to small numbers of sequences, and,
as a consequence, explicit ARG inference is rarely used in applied population
genomics. Here, we introduce a new algorithm for ARG inference that is
efficient enough to apply to dozens of complete mammalian genomes. The key idea
of our approach is to sample an ARG of n chromosomes conditional on an ARG of
n-1 chromosomes, an operation we call ""threading."" Using techniques based on
hidden Markov models, we can perform this threading operation exactly, up to
the assumptions of the sequentially Markov coalescent and a discretization of
time. An extension allows for threading of subtrees instead of individual
sequences. Repeated application of these threading operations results in highly
efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers for ARGs. We have implemented these
methods in a computer program called ARGweaver. Experiments with simulated data
indicate that ARGweaver converges rapidly to the true posterior distribution
and is effective in recovering various features of the ARG for dozens of
sequences generated under realistic parameters for human populations. In
applications of ARGweaver to 54 human genome sequences from Complete Genomics,
we find clear signatures of natural selection, including regions of unusually
ancient ancestry associated with balancing selection and reductions in allele
age in sites under directional selection. Preliminary results also indicate
that our methods can be used to gain insight into complex features of human
population structure, even with a noninformative prior distribution.

crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) and electron teleportation (ET). When the
coupling energy of MFs is much larger than the coupling between MFs and QDs,
electron can tunnel through topological superconductor either via CAR or ET

MFs (denoted as $E_M$), the electron in the left lead can teleport to the right
lead via MFs while when $\epsilon_1=-\epsilon_2=E_M$ is satisfied, the electron
in the left lead can combine one electron in the right lead to form a cooper
pair and tunnel into the topological superconductor via MFs. Since both

nutrient loading increased nearly 300% since 1950, primarily due to increased
use of agricultural fertilizers. Over this same time period, the red snapper
(Lutjanus campechanus) population in the Gulf of Mexico has shifted strongly
from being dominated by the eastern Gulf of Mexico to being dominated by the
northern and western Gulf of Mexico, with the bulk of the current population in
the same regions with significant nutrient loading from the Mississippi and
Atchafalaya rivers and in or near areas with development of mid-summer hypoxic
zones. The population decline of red snapper in the eastern Gulf is almost
certainly attributable to overfishing, but the cause of the population increase
in the northern and western Gulf is subject to broad debate, with the impact of
artificial reefs (primarily oil platforms which have incr eased greatly since
the 1960s) being the most contentious point. Nutrient loading has been shown to
positively impact secondary production of fish in many marine systems. The
present paper offers the hypothesis that increased nutrient loading has
contributed significantly to increased red snapper population in the northern
and western Gulf of Mexico. Nutrient loading may be working in synergy with the
abundant oil platforms both increasing primary production and providing
structure encouraging red snapper to feed throughout the water column.

Rsun, and a radioactive Ni-56 mass of 0.015 Msun. The estimated progenitor mass

early phase, which cannot be resolved within a spherically symmetric model. The
presupernova of SN 2008in was a normal red supergiant with the minimum mass of
the progenitor among eight type IIP supernovae explored by means of the
hydrodynamic modeling. The problem of the absence of type IIP supernovae with
the progenitor masses <15 Msun in this sample remains open.

copper oxide superconductors and its interplay with unconventional {\it d-wave}
superconductivity has been a long standing issue for more than a decade. There
is now a growing number of experimental indications that the pseudo-gap phase
actually corresponds to a symmetry breaking state. In his theory for cuprates,
C. M. Varma proposes that the pseudo-gap is a new state of matter associated
with the spontaneous appearance of circulating current loops within $\rm CuO_2$
unit cell. This intra-unit-cell order breaks time reversal symmetry, but
preserves lattice translation invariance. Polarized elastic neutron scattering
measurements provide evidence for an intra-unit-cell magnetic order inside the
pseudo-gap state. This order could be produced by the orbital-like magnetic
moments induced by the circulating current loops. The magnetic order displays
the same characteristic features in $\rm HgBa_2CuO_{4+\delta}$, $\rm
YBa_2Cu_3O_{6+x}$ and $\rm Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_{8+\delta}$ demonstrating that this
genuine phase is ubiquitous of the pseudo-gap of high temperature copper oxide
materials. We review the main properties characterizing this intra-unit-cell
magnetic order and discuss its interplay or competition with other spin and
charge instabilities.

pressure data were collected at constant volume on cooling, with P varying from
1.92 kbar at temperature T = 260 K to 1.85 kbar at T = 220 K. Analysis of the
observed dynamic structure factor S(Q, E) reveals the presence of two
relaxation processes, a faster diffusion component (FC) associated with the
motion of ""caged"" or restricted molecules, and a slower component arising from
the free water molecules diffusing within the SWNT matrix. While the
temperature dependence of the slow relaxation time exhibits a
Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann law and is non-Arrhenius in nature, the faster component
follows an Arrhenius exponential law at both pressure conditions. The
application of pressure remarkably slows down the overall molecular dynamics,
in agreement with previous observations, but most notably affects the slow
relaxation. The faster relaxation shows marginal or no change with pressure

knowledge of quantities -- such as the matter density parameter \Omega_M --
that are imprinted on the dark matter halo mass function (HMF), a powerful
probe of dark matter and dark energy models. In this letter we trace how
changes in the cosmological parameters over the last decade have influenced
uncertainty in our knowledge of the HMF. We show that this uncertainty has
reduced significantly since the 3rd WMAP data release, but the rate of this
reduction is slowing. This is limited by uncertainty in the normalisation
\sigma_8, whose influence is most pronounced at the high mass end of the mass
function. Interestingly, we find that the accuracy with which we can constrain
the HMF in terms of the cosmological parameters has now reached the point at
which it is comparable to the scatter in HMF fitting functions. This suggests
that the power of the HMF as a precision probe of dark matter and dark energy
hinges on more accurate determination of the theoretical HMF. Finally, we
assess prospects of using the HMF to differentiate between Cold and Warm Dark
Matter models based on ongoing improvements in measurements of \Omega_M, and we
comment briefly on optimal survey strategies for constraining dark matter and

zero-coupon rate can never fall. This result, which, although undoubtedly
correct, has been regarded by many as surprising, stems from the implicit
assumption that the long-term discount function has an exponential tail. We
revisit the problem in the setting of modern interest rate theory, and show
that if the long ""simple"" interest rate (or Libor rate) is finite, then this
rate (unlike the zero-coupon rate) acts viably as a state variable, the value
of which can fluctuate randomly in line with other economic indicators. New
interest rate models are constructed, under this hypothesis and certain
generalizations thereof, that illustrate explicitly the good asymptotic
behaviour of the resulting discount bond systems. The conditions necessary for
the existence of such ""hyperbolic"" and ""generalized hyperbolic"" long rates are
those of so-called social discounting, which allow for long-term cash flows to
be treated as broadly ""just as important"" as those of the short or medium term.
As a consequence, we are able to provide a consistent arbitrage-free valuation
framework for the cost-benefit analysis and risk management of long-term social
projects, such as those associated with sustainable energy, resource
conservation, and climate change.

the same sky position on an image series. We describe two implementations of
the method: one that resamples images before measuring fluxes, and one which
does not. In both instances, we sketch the key algorithms involved and present
the validation using semi-artificial sources introduced in real images in order
to assess the accuracy of the supernova flux measurements relative to that of
surrounding stars. We describe the methods required to anchor these PSF fluxes
to calibrated aperture catalogs, in order to derive SN magnitudes. We find a
marginally significant bias of 2 mmag of the after-resampling method, and no
bias at the mmag accuracy for the non-resampling method. Given surrounding star
magnitudes, we determine the systematic uncertainty of SN magnitudes to be less
than 1.5 mmag, which represents about one third of the current photometric
calibration uncertainty affecting SN measurements. The SN photometry delivers
several by-products: bright star PSF flux mea- surements which have a
repeatability of about 0.6%, as for aperture measurements; we measure relative
astrometric positions with a noise floor of 2.4 mas for a single-image bright
star measurement; we show that in all bands of the MegaCam instrument, stars
exhibit a profile linearly broadening with flux by about 0.5% over the whole

detached plasmoid, resulting from a magnetic reconnection process, as is
typically found in connection with solar flares. We study spontaneous current
fragmentation caused by shear and vortex plasma flows. An exact analytical
transformation method was applied to calculate self-consistent solutions of the
nonlinear stationary MHD equations. The assumption of incompressible
field-aligned flows implies that both the Alfven Mach number and the mass
density are constant on field lines. We first calculated nonlinear MHS
equilibria with the help of the Liouville method, emulating the scenario of a
solar eruptive flare configuration with plasmoids and flare arcade. Then a Mach
number profile was constructed that describes the upflow along the open
magnetic field lines and implements a vortex flow inside the plasmoid. This
Mach number profile was used to map the MHS equilibrium to the stationary one.
We find that current fragmentation takes place at different locations within
our configuration. Steep gradients of the Alfven Mach number are required,
implying the strong influence of shear flows on current amplification and
filamentation of the MHS current sheets. Crescent- or ring-like structures
appear along the outer separatrix, butterfly structures between the upper and
lower plasmoids, and strong current peaks close the lower boundary. Impressing
an intrinsic small-scale structure on the upper plasmoid results in strong
fragmentation of the plasmoid. Hence fragmentation of current sheets and
plasmoids is an inherent property of MHD theory. Transformations from MHS into
MHD steady-states deliver fine-structures needed for plasma heating and
acceleration of particles and bulk plasma flows in dissipative events that are
typically connected to magnetic reconnection processes in flares and coronal

nuggets, like nuclearites (nuclear matter with a strange quark). This search
has been carried out using data from two 2350 Kg, 2 K cooled, aluminum bar
detectors: NAUTILUS, located in Frascati (Italy), and EXPLORER, that was
located in CERN Geneva (CH). Both antennas are equipped with cosmic ray shower
detectors: signals in the bar due to showers are continuously detected and used
to characterize the antenna performances. The bar excitation mechanism is based
on the so called thermo-acoustic effect, studied on dedicated experiments that
use particle beams. This mechanism predicts that vibrations of bars are induced
by the heat deposited in the bar from the particle. The geometrical acceptance
of the bar detectors is 19.5 $\rm m^2$ sr, that is smaller than that of other
detectors used for similar searches. However, the detection mechanism is
completely different and is more straightforward than in other detectors. We
will show the results of ten years of data from NAUTILUS (2003-2012) and 7
years from EXPLORER (2003-2009). The experimental limits we obtain are of
interest because, for nuclearites of mass less than $10^{-4}$ grams, we find a
flux smaller than that one predicted considering nuclearites as dark matter
candidates.

is a partition of G's vertices into D parts associated with the rows of M. The
part of each vertex is chosen from a given list so that no edge of G maps to a
0 in M and no non-edge of G maps to a 1 in M. Many important graph-theoretic
structures can be represented as list M-partitions, such as graph colourings,
split graphs and homogeneous sets and pairs, which arise in the proofs of the
weak and strong perfect graph conjectures. There has been quite a bit of work
on determining for which matrices M computations involving list M-partitions
are tractable. We focus on counting list M-partitions, given a graph G and a
list for each vertex of G. We identify a set of ""tractable"" matrices and give
an algorithm that counts list M-partitions in polynomial time for every (fixed)
matrix M in this set. The algorithm uses data structures such as sparse-dense
partitions and subcube decompositions to reduce each instance to a sequence of
instances in which the lists restrict access to portions of M in which the
interaction of 0s and 1s is controlled. We solve the resulting restricted
instances by converting them into counting constraint satisfaction problems
(#CSPs) which we solve using arc-consistency. For every matrix M for which our
algorithm fails, we show that counting list M-partitions is #P-complete.
Further, we give an explicit characterisation of the dichotomy theorem:
counting list M-partitions is in FP if M has a structure called a
derectangularising sequence; otherwise, counting list M-partitions is #P-hard.
We show that the meta-problem of determining whether a given matrix has a
derectangularising sequence is NP-complete. Finally, we show that lists can be
used to encode cardinality restrictions in M-partitions problems and use this
to give a polynomial-time algorithm for counting homogeneous pairs in graphs.

stars -- often called ""hot Neptunes"" -- are common within the known population
of exoplanets and planetary candidates. Similar to our own Uranus and Neptune,
inefficient accretion of nebular gas is expected produce hot Neptunes whose
masses are dominated by elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. At high
atmospheric metallicities of 10-10,000x solar, hot Neptunes will exhibit an
interesting continuum of atmospheric compositions, ranging from more
Neptune-like, H2-dominated atmospheres to more Venus-like, CO2-dominated
atmospheres. We explore the predicted equilibrium and disequilibrium chemistry
of generic hot Neptunes and find that the atmospheric composition varies
strongly as a function of temperature and bulk atmospheric properties such as
metallicity and the C/O ratio. Relatively exotic H2O, CO, CO2, and even
O2-dominated atmospheres are possible for hot Neptunes. We apply our models to
the case of GJ 436b, where we find that a CO-rich, CH4-poor atmosphere can be a
natural consequence of a very high atmospheric metallicity. From comparisons of
our results with Spitzer eclipse data for GJ 436b, we conclude that although
the spectral fit from the high-metallicity forward models is not quite as good
as the fit obtained from pure retrieval methods, the atmospheric composition
predicted by these forward models is more physically and chemically plausible.
High-metallicity atmospheres (orders of magnitude in excess of solar) should
therefore be considered as a possibility for GJ 436b and other hot Neptunes.

their spatial density. Permanent ""Stay alive"" signals from their neighbours
seem to prevent them from dying. In a previous paper (Wang et al. 2013) we gave
evidence for a density effect for ants. In this paper we examine whether there
is a similar effect in human demography. We find that although there is no
observable relationship between population density and overall death rates,
there is a clear relationship between density and the death rates of young
age-groups. Basically their death rates decrease with increasing density.
However, this relationship breaks down around 300 inhabitants per square
kilometre. Above this threshold the death rates remains fairly constant. The
same density effect is observed in Canada, France, Japan and the United States.
We also observe a striking parallel between the density effect and the
so-called marital status effect in the sense that they both lead to higher
suicide rates and are both enhanced for younger age-groups. However, it should
be noted that the strength of the density effect is only a fraction of the
strength of the marital status effect. In spite of the fact that this parallel
does not give us an explanation by itself, it invites us to focus on
explanations that apply to both effects. In this light the ""Stay alive""
paradigm set forth by Prof. Martin Raff appears as a natural interpretation. It
can be seen as an extension of the ""social ties"" framework proposed at the end
of the 19th century by the sociologist Emile Durkheim in his study about

effects is that electron-phonon coupling can lead to the formation of a Cooper
pair out of two repelling electrons, the basis for BCS superconductivity. Here
we study the interaction of a single localized electron with a Bose-Einstein
condensate (BEC) and show that it can excite phonons and eventually set the
whole condensate into a collective oscillation. We find that the coupling is
surprisingly strong as compared to ionic impurities due to the more favorable
mass ratio. The electron is held in place by a single charged ionic core
forming a Rydberg bound state. This Rydberg electron is described by a
wavefunction extending to a size comparable to the dimensions of the BEC,
namely up to 8 micrometers. In such a state, corresponding to a principal
quantum number of n=202, the Rydberg electron is interacting with several tens
of thousands of condensed atoms contained within its orbit. We observe
surprisingly long lifetimes and finite size effects due to the electron
exploring the wings of the BEC. Based on our results we anticipate future

  measurements","11 pages. Accepted by MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stu258",,"astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Imaging the direct light signal from a faint exoplanet against the
overwhelming glare of its host star presents one of the fundamental challenges
to modern astronomical instrumentation. Achieving sufficient signal-to-noise
for detection by direct imaging is limited by three basic physical processes:
aberration of the wavefronts (both instrumental and atmospheric), photon noise,
and detector noise. In this paper, we advance a novel optical setup which
synthesizes the advantages of two different techniques: nulling interferometry
to mitigate photon noise, and closure phase to combat optical aberrations. Our
design, which employs technology from integrated optics and photonics, is
intended to combine the advantageous aspects of both a coronagraph and a
non-redundant interferometer inside a single optical device. We show that such
an instrument would have a dynamic range limited either by i) the readout noise
(if perfect co-phasing), or ii) the photon noise due to stellar flux leakage
(in the case of imperfect nulling). This concept is optimal when the readout
noise is not the main limitation, ie, for space interferometry or for ground
based observations of bright stellar hosts (apparent magnitude brighter than
10).

channels. A novel rateless encoding scheme is developed to overcome the high
error floor problem caused by the low-density generator matrix (LDGM)-like
encoding scheme in conventional rateless codes. This is achieved by providing
each symbol with approximately equal protection in the encoding process. An
extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart based optimization approach is
proposed to obtain a robust check node degree distribution, which can achieve
near-capacity performances for a wide range of signal to noise ratios (SNR).
Simulation results show that, under the same channel conditions and
transmission overheads, the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of the proposed
scheme considerably outperforms the existing rateless codes in additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, particularly at low BER regions.

external pump to compensate losses. We observe robust circularly polarised
solitons when a circularly polarised pump is applied, a result attributed to
phase synchronisation between nondegenerate TE and TM polarised polariton modes
at high momenta. For the case of a linearly polarised pump either s+ or s-
circularly polarised bright solitons can be switched on in a controlled way by
a s+ or s- writing beam respectively. This feature arises directly from the
widely differing interaction strengths between co- and cross-circularly
polarised polaritons. In the case of orthogonally linearly polarised pump and
writing beams, the soliton emission on average is found to be unpolarised,
suggesting strong spatial evolution of the soliton polarisation, a conclusion
supported by polarisation correlation measurements. The observed results are in
agreement with theory, which predicts stable circularly polarised solitons and
unstable linearly polarised solitons resulting in spatial evolution of their
polarisation.

between the Earth and the Sun (new moon) the distance from a given terrestrial
location to the Moon is shorter at noon than at midnight. This reduces the
gravitational acceleration and therefore increases the period of a simple

results and discuss how the accuracy can be further improved. It is hoped that
the present paper will encourage new experiments in this direction.

advances in all these questions. The relevance of the spatial variability of
the drop-size distribution for remote sensing measurements and
hydro-meteorology field studies is asserted by analyzing the measurement of a
set of disdrometers deployed on a network of 5 squared kilometers. This study
comprises the spatial variability of integral rainfall parameters, the ZR
relationships, and the variations within the one moment scaling method. The
modeling of the drop-size distribution is analyzed by applying the MaxEnt
method and comparing it with the methods of moments and the maximum likelihood.
The instrumental errors are analyzed with a compressive comparison of sampling
and binning uncertainties that affect actual devices. These analysis are
further extended in several appendices where an error analysis is developed and
new studies are proposed. The relevance of the pre-processing of disdrometric
measurements is also assessed. The data-sets evaluated comprise experimental
measurements of the GPM (NASA-JAXA) ground validation satellite mission and
synthetic distributions generated computationally.

subsets of P, called the regular closed subsets, form an ortholattice Reg(P,f),
extending the poset Clop(P,f) of all clopen subsets. If (P,f) is a finite
convex geometry, then Reg(P,f) is pseudocomplemented. The Dedekind-MacNeille
completion of the poset of regions of any central hyperplane arrangement can be
obtained in this way, hence it is pseudocomplemented. The lattice Reg(P,f)
carries a particularly interesting structure for special types of convex
geometries, that we call closure spaces of semilattice type. For finite such
closure spaces, (1) Reg(P,f) satisfies an infinite collection of stronger and
stronger quasi-identities, weaker than both meet- and join-semidistributivity.
Nevertheless it may fail semidistributivity. (2) If Reg(P,f) is
semidistributive, then it is a bounded homomorphic image of a free lattice. (3)
Clop(P,f) is a lattice iff every regular closed set is clopen. The extended
permutohedron R(G) on a graph G, and the extended permutohedron Reg(S) on a
join-semilattice S, are both defined as lattices of regular closed sets of
suitable closure spaces. While the lattice of regular closed sets is, in the
semilattice context, always the Dedekind Mac-Neille completion of the poset of
clopen sets, this does not always hold in the graph context, although it always
does so for finite block graphs and for cycles. Furthermore, both R(G) and
Reg(S) are bounded homomorphic images of free lattices.

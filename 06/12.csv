exhibit an impressive bulk refractive-index sensitivity determined solely by
the grating period. However, the surface sensitivity (which is a key figure of
merit for label-free chemical and biological sensing) needs to be carefully
investigated to assess the actual applicability of this technological platform.
In this paper, we explore the sensitivity of RAs in metal nanogratings when
local refractive-index changes are considered. Our studies reveal that the
surface sensitivity deteriorates up to two orders of magnitude by comparison
with the corresponding bulk value; interestingly, this residual sensitivity is
not attributable to the wavelength shift of the RAs, which are completely
insensitive to local refractive-index changes, but rather to a strictly
connected plasmonic effect. Our analysis for increasing overlay thickness
reveals an ultimate surface sensitivity that approaches the RA bulk value,
which turns out to be the upper-limit of grating-assisted
surface-plasmon-polariton sensitivities.

W(CO)5 as well as Co2(CO)8 and Co(CO)4 precursor molecules on fully and
partially hydroxylated silica surfaces. Such surfaces resemble the initial
conditions of electron beam induced growth processes. We find that both W(CO)6

do not change their binding site. These results contribute to gaining
fundamental insight into how the molecules behave in the simulated time window

signatures for experimentally distinguishing the form in which precursors cover

advance over a dry solid of arbitrary wettability. We show that entrainment
occurs at a critical advancing speed beyond which the balance between
capillary, viscous and contact line forces sustaining the shape of the
interface is no longer satisfied. Wetting couples to the hydrodynamics by
setting both the morphology of the interface at small scales and the viscous
friction of the front. We find that the critical deformation that the interface
can sustain is controlled by the friction at the contact line and the viscosity
contrast between the displacing and displaced fluids, leading to a rich variety
of wetting-entrainment regimes. We discuss the potential use of our theory to
measure contact-line forces using atomic force microscopy, and to study
entrainment under microfluidic conditions exploiting colloid-polymer fluids of
ultra-low surface tension.

of a shared key without any assumptions on the apparatus used, provided that
the observed data violate a Bell inequality. Such violation is challenging
experimentally due to channel losses and photo-detection inefficiencies. Here
we describe a realistic DIQKD protocol based on interaction between light and
spins stored in cavities, which allows a heralded mapping of polarisation
entanglement of light onto the spin. The spin state can subsequently be
measured with near unit efficiency. Heralding alleviates the effect of channel
loss, and as the protocol allows for local heralding, the spin decay is not
affected by the communication time between the parties, making Bell inequality
violation over an arbitrary distance possible. We compute the achievable key
rates of the protocol, based on recent estimates of experimentally accessible
parameter values and compare to the other known DIQKD protocol, which is
entirely optical. We find significant improvements in terms of key bits per
source use. For example we gain about five orders of magnitude over a distance
of 75km, for realistic parameter values.

different approaches: the gradient elasticity models (weak non-locality) and

the fractional generalization of gradient elasticity that allows us to describe
a weak non-locality of power-law type. We suggest a lattice model with spatial
dispersion of power-law type as a microscopic model of fractional gradient
elastic continuum. We prove that the continuous limit maps the equations for
lattice with this spatial dispersion into the continuum equations with
fractional Laplacians in the Riesz form. A weak non-locality of power-law type
in the non-local elasticity theory is derived from the fractional weak spatial
dispersion in the lattice model. The suggested continuum equations, which are
obtained from the lattice model, describe a fractional generalization of the
gradient elasticity. These equations of fractional elasticity are solved for
some special cases: sub-gradient elasticity and super-gradient elasticity.

white dwarf cosmochronology of Galactic populations on more solid grounds. This
issue is particularly relevant in view of the enhanced observational
capabilities provided by the next generation of Extremely Large Telescopes,
that will offer more avenues to employ white dwarfs as probes of Galactic
evolution and test-beds of fundamental physics. We estimate for the first time
the consistency of results obtained from two independent and widely used
evolutionary codes (BaSTI and LPCODE) for white dwarf models with fixed mass
and chemical stratification, when the same input physics is employed in both
codes. We considered 0.55Msun white dwarf models with both pure carbon and
uniform carbon-oxygen (50/50 mass fractions) core. We have assessed for the
first time the maximum possible accuracy in the current estimates of white
dwarf cooling times, resulting only from the different implementations of the
stellar evolution equations and homogeneous input physics in two independent
stellar evolution codes. This accuracy amounts to 2% at luminosities lower than
log(L/L_{\sun})= -1.5$. This agreement is true for both pure carbon and uniform
carbon-oxygen stratification core models, and also when the release of latent
heat and carbon-oxygen phase separation are considered. This difference is
smaller than the uncertainties in cooling times due to the present
uncertainties in the white dwarf chemical stratification. We have also
determined quantitatively and explained the effect of varying equation of
state, low-temperature radiative opacities and electron conduction opacities in
our calculation. Finally, we extend the scope of our work by providing
tabulations of our cooling sequences and the required input physics, that can
be used as a comparison test of cooling times obtained from other white dwarf
evolutionary codes.

  Approach",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Filter bank-based multicarrier (FBMC) systems based on offset QAM (FBMC/OQAM)
have recently attracted increased interest in several applications due to their
enhanced flexibility, higher spectral efficiency, and better spectral
containment compared to conventional OFDM. They suffer, however, from an
inter-carrier/inter-symbol interference that complicates signal processing
tasks such as channel estimation. Most of the methods reported thus far rely on
the assumption of (almost) flat subchannels to more easily tackle this problem,
addressing it in a way similar to OFDM. However, this assumption may be often
quite inaccurate, due to the high freq. selectivity of the channel and/or the
small number of subcarriers employed to cope with frequency dispersion in fast
fading. In such cases, severe error floors are exhibited at medium to high SNR
values, which cancel the advantage of FBMC over OFDM. Moreover, the existing
methods provide estimates of the subchannel responses, most commonly in the
frequency domain. The goal of this paper is to revisit this problem through an
alternative formulation that focuses on the estimation of the channel impulse
response itself and makes no assumption on the degree of frequency selectivity
of the subchannels. The possible gains in estimation performance offered by
such an approach are investigated through the design of optimal (in the MSE
sense) preambles, of both the full and sparse types, and of the smallest
possible duration of only one pilot FBMC symbol. Existing designs for flat
subchannels are then shown to result as special cases. Longer preambles,
consisting of two consecutive pilot FBMC symbols, are also analyzed. The
simulation results demonstrate significant improvements from the proposed
approach for both mildly and highly frequency selective channels. Most notably,
no error floors appear anymore over a quite wide range of SNR values.

the following: By removing as many receive antennas as needed to obtain a
square system (provided the channel matrices before and after the removal have
full rank) the maximum resulting loss of mutual information over all
signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) depends only on $R$, $T$ and the matrix of
left-singular vectors of the initial channel matrix, but not on its singular
values. In particular, if the latter matrix is Haar distributed the ergodic
rate loss is given by $\sum_{t=1}^{T}\sum_{r=T+1}^{R}\frac{1}{r-t}$ nats. Under
the same assumption, if $T,R\to \infty$ with the ratio $\phi\triangleq T/R$
fixed, the rate loss normalized by $R$ converges almost surely to $H(\phi)$

images of palm. After palm extraction, the features of hand were extracted
using K-L Transform technique and finally the input gesture was recognized

gestures, and recognizing rate obtained was 96%. Hence we propose an easy
approach to recognize different hand gestures.

under-luminous in the IR with L_{IR} << L_{X}. Since Ultra-luminous X-ray
sources in nearby galaxies may be an intermediate class between AGN and GXB, it
is interesting to study if their IR properties indicate which kind of objects
they resemble. We use Spitzer IRAC images to identify mid-IR counterparts of
bright X-ray sources, detected by Chandra in the elliptical galaxy NGC 1399. We
find that for sources with AGN-like IR flux ratios, the IR luminosity strongly
correlates with that in X-rays, L_{IR} ~ L_{X}, while for the others, there is
no correlation between the two. Some of the former objects may be background
AGN. If they are not strongly contaminated by background AGN, this result
extends the IR-X-ray luminosity correlation down to L_{X} ~ 10^{39} ergs/s. We
calculate their g-z colours and find that the bright X-ray sources with IR
counterparts are typically blue in optical color. This is in contrast to
typical X-ray sources, without IR counterparts which have predominantly red
optical counterparts. We highlight the need for IR or optical spectra of these
sources to distinguish background AGN and unveil the effect of the X-ray

which may also act as a torsion potential in Lyra geometry, we study the
effects of spacetime torsion on the dynamics of a collapsing massive star.
Taking the interior spacetime as the FLRW metric and the matter content as
spherically symmetric, homogeneous perfect fluid with the equation of state
(EoS) $p=w\rho$, we show that the collapse ends in a spacetime singularity
which is of the strong curvature type in the sense of Tipler. Whether the
trapped surfaces form during the dynamical evolution of the collapse depends on
the torsion parameter, related to the BD coupling parameter, and the EoS
subject to the conditions on physical reasonableness of the collapse
configuration. Hence, the space of torsion and EoS parameters is divided into
two portions, one for which the collapse process leads to the formation of
apparent horizon and the other for which the apparent horizon is failed to form
in the interior region. The nature of the singularity is examined from the
exterior perspective, by searching for the existence of radial null geodesics
reaching the faraway observers. Moreover, it is found that the effects of a
dynamical torsion can be transferred to the outside region of the collapsing
star, making the exterior region dynamic.

ubiquitous in living systems. Since protein composition determines responses in
individual cells, it stands to reason that the variations themselves are
subject to selective pressures. But the functional role of these cell-to-cell
differences is not well understood. One way to tackle questions regarding
relationships between form and function is to perturb the form (e.g., change
the protein abundances) and observe the resulting changes in some function.
Here we take on the form-function relationship from the inverse perspective,
asking instead what specific constraints on cell-to-cell variations in protein
abundance are imposed by a given functional phenotype. We develop a maximum
entropy (MaxEnt) based approach to posing questions of this type, and
illustrate the method by application to the well characterized chemotactic
response in Escherichia coli (E. coli). We find that full determination of
observed cell-to-cell variations in protein abundances is not inherent in
chemotaxis itself, but in fact appears to be jointly imposed by the chemotaxis
program in conjunction with other factors, e.g., the protein synthesis
machinery and/or additional non-chemotactic cell functions such as cell
metabolism. These results illustrate the power of MaxEnt as a tool for the
investigation of relationships between biological form and function.

spinning skirt, lagging behind the material flow of the fabric. These
qualitative features are captured with a minimal model of traveling waves on an
inextensible, flexible, generalized-conical sheet rotating about a fixed axis.
Conservation laws are used to reduce the dynamics to a quadrature describing a
particle in a three-parameter family of potentials. One parameter is associated
with the stress in the sheet, aNoether is the current associated with
rotational invariance, and the third is a Rossby number which indicates the
relative strength of Coriolis forces. Solutions are quantized by enforcing a
topology appropriate to a skirt and a particular choice of dihedral symmetry. A
perturbative analysis of nearly axisymmetric cones shows that Coriolis effects
are essential in establishing skirt-like solutions. Fully non-linear solutions

formulate because of their complex many-body dynamics. A better knowledge of
the decay dynamics would help in the construction of decoupling control
schemes. Here we use solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance techniques to
experimentally investigate the decay of coherent multi-spin states in linear
spin chains. Leveraging on the quasi-one-dimensional geometry of Fluorapatite
crystal spin systems, we can gain a deeper insight on the multi-spin states
created by the coherent evolution, and their subsequent decay, than it is
possible in 3D systems. We are then able to formulate an analytical model that
captures the key features of the decay. We can thus compare the decoherence
behavior for different initial states of the spin chain and link their decay
rate to the state characteristics, in particular their coherence and long-range
correlation among spins. Our experimental and theoretical study shows that the
spin chains undergo a rich dynamics, with a slower decay rate than for the 3D
case, and thus might be more amenable to decoupling techniques.

heterostructure-based 2D carrier systems as arising from a classical
percolation phenomenon in the inhomogeneous density landscape created by the
long-range potential fluctuations induced by random quenched charged impurities
in the environment. The long-range Coulomb disorder inherent in semiconductors
produces strong potential fluctuations in the 2D system where a fraction of the
carriers gets trapped or classically localized, leading to a mixed 2-component
semiclassical transport behavior at intermediate densities where a fraction of
the carriers is mobile and another fraction immobile. At high carrier density,
all the carriers are essentially mobile whereas at low carrier density all the
carriers are essentially trapped since there is no possible percolating
transport path through the lake-and-mountain inhomogeneous potential landscape.
The low-density situation with no percolation would mimic an insulator whereas
the high-density situation with allowed percolating paths through the
lake-and-mountain energy landscape would mimic a metal with the system
manifesting an apparent MIT in between. We calculate the transport properties
as a function of carrier density, impurity density, impurity location, and
temperature using a 2-component (trapped and mobile carriers) effective medium
theory. Our theoretically calculated transport properties are in good
qualitative agreement with the experimentally observed 2D MIT phenomenology in
2D electron and hole systems. We find a high (low) density metallic
(insulating) temperature-dependence of the 2D resistivity, and an
intermediate-density crossover behavior which could be identified with the

star. It also displays a spectacular array of bipolar lobes with a dense
equatorial region, which makes it an excellent object to study the development
of asymmetries in evolved stars. In the recent decades, an elliptical compact
HII region located in the center of the nebula has been seen to be increasing
in size and flux. This seems to be due to the ionization of the circumstellar
envelope by the central star, and it would be indicating the beginning of the
planetary nebula phase for CRL 618. We analyzed interferometric radio continuum
data at ~5 and 22 GHz from observations carried out at seven epochs with the
VLA. We traced the increase of the flux of the ionized region over a period of
~26 years. We measured the dimensions of the HII region directly from the
brightness distribution images to determine the increase of its size over time.
For one of the epochs we analyzed observations at six frequencies from which we
estimated the electron density distribution. We carried out model calculations
of the spectral energy distribution at two different epochs to corroborate our
observational results. We found that the radio continuum flux and the size of
the ionized region have been increasing monotonically in the last three
decades. The size of the major axis of the HII region shows a dependance with
frequency, which has been interpreted as a result of a gradient of the electron
density in this direction. The growth of the HII region is due to the expansion
of an ionized wind whose mass-loss rate increased continuously for a period of
~100 years until a few decades ago, when the mass-loss rate experienced a
sudden decline. Our results indicate that the beginning of the ionization of
the circumstellar envelope began around 1971, which marks the start of the

vout ~0.1c. These outflows may be the source of AGN feedback on their host
galaxies sought by galaxy formation modellers. The exact effect of the outflows
on the ambient galaxy gas strongly depends on whether the shocked UFOs cool
rapidly or not. This in turn depends on whether the shocked electrons share the
same temperature as ions (one temperature regime; 1T) or decouple (2T), as has
been recently suggested. Here we calculate the Inverse Compton spectrum emitted
by such shocks, finding a broad feature potentially detectable either in
mid-to-high energy X-rays (1T case) or only in the soft X-rays (2T). We argue
that current observations of AGN do not seem to show evidence for the 1T
component. The limits on the 2T emission are far weaker, and in fact it is
possible that the observed soft X-ray excess of AGN is partially or fully due
to the 2T shock emission. This suggests that UFOs are in the energy-driven
regime outside the central few pc, and must pump considerable amounts of not
only momentum but also energy into the ambient gas. We encourage X-ray
observers to look for the Inverse Compton components calculated here in order

primary has a candidate debris disc. The primary, TYC 5241-986-1 A, is a known
Tycho star which we classify as a late-K star with emission in the X-ray, near
and far-UV and H\alpha\ suggestive of youth. Its proper motion, photometric
distance (65-105 pc) and radial velocity lead us to associate the system with
the broadly defined Local Association of young stars but not specifically with
any young moving group. The presence of weak lithium absorption and X-ray and
calcium H and K emission support an age in the 20 to ~125 Myr range. The
secondary is a pair of M4.5+-0.5 dwarfs with near and far UV and H\alpha\
emission separated by approximately 1 arcsec (~65-105 AU projected separation)
which lie 145 arcsec (9200-15200 AU) from the primary. The primary has a WISE
22 micron excess and follow-up Herschel observations also detect an excess at
70 micron. The excess emissions are indicative of a 100-175 K debris disc. We
also explore the possibility that this excess could be due to a coincident
background galaxy and conclude that this is unlikely. Debris discs are
extremely rare around stars older than 15 Myr, hence if the excess is caused by
a disc this is an extremely novel system.

star-forming galaxy NGC 253. The 3-40 keV NuSTAR intensity of the inner 20
arcsec (~400 pc) nuclear region varied by a factor of ~2 across the three
monitoring observations. The Chandra data reveal that the nuclear region
contains three bright X-ray sources, including a luminous (L2-10 keV ~ few x
10^39 erg/s) point source ~1 arcsec from the dynamical center of the galaxy
(within the 3sigma positional uncertainty of the dynamical center); this source
drives the overall variability of the nuclear region at energies >3 keV. We
make use of the variability to measure the spectra of this single hard X-ray
source when it was in bright states. The spectra are well described by an
absorbed (NH ~ 1.6 x 10^23 cm^-2) broken power-law model with spectral slopes
and break energies that are typical of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), but
not AGN. A previous Chandra observation in 2003 showed a hard X-ray point
source of similar luminosity to the 2012 source that was also near the
dynamical center (~0.4 arcsec); however, this source was offset from the 2012
source position by ~1 arcsec. We show that the probability of the 2003 and 2012
hard X-ray sources being unrelated is >>99.99% based on the Chandra spatial
localizations. Interestingly, the Chandra spectrum of the 2003 source (3-8 keV)
is shallower in slope than that of the 2012 hard X-ray source. Its proximity to
the dynamical center and harder Chandra spectrum indicate that the 2003 source
is a better AGN candidate than any of the sources detected in our 2012
campaign; however, we were unable to rule out a ULX nature for this source.
Future NuSTAR and Chandra monitoring would be well equipped to break the
degeneracy between the AGN and ULX nature of the 2003 source, if again caught
in a high state.

tend to focus on studying extreme starbursts, such as the Antennae galaxies. We
aim to establish whether there is something special occurring in these extreme
systems or whether the mechanism for cluster formation is present in all
mergers to a greater or lesser degree. We undertake a general study of
merger-induced star formation in a sample of 5 pc resolution adaptive mesh
refinement simulations of low redshift equal-mass mergers with randomly-chosen
orbital parameters. We find that there is an enhanced mass fraction of very
dense gas that appears as the gas density probability density function evolves
during the merger. This finding has implications for the interpretation of some
observations; a larger mass fraction of dense gas could account for the
enhanced HCN/CO ratios seen in ULIRGs and predicts that alpha_CO is lower in
mergers, as for a given mass of H_2, CO emission will increase in a denser
environment. We also find that as the star formation rate increases, there is a
correlated peak in the velocity dispersion of the gas, which we attribute to
increasing turbulence driven by the interaction itself. Star formation tends to
be clumpy: in some cases there is extended clumpy star formation, but even when
star formation is concentrated within the inner kpc (i.e. what may be
considered a nuclear starburst) it still often has a clumpy, rather than a
smooth, distribution. We find no strong evidence for a clear bimodality in the
Kennicutt-Schmidt relation for the average mergers simulated here. Instead,
they are typically somewhat offset above the predicted quiescent relation
during their starbursts.

with the world sheet doubled formalism which describes strings in an extended
space time with extra coordinates conjugate to winding modes. This formalism is
T-duality symmetric and can accommodate non-geometric T-fold backgrounds which
are beyond the scope of Riemannian geometry. Vanishing of the conformal anomaly
of this theory can be interpreted as a set of spacetime equations for the
background fields. These equations follow from an action principle that has
been dubbed Double Field Theory (DFT). We review the aspects of generalised
geometry relevant for DFT. We outline recent extensions of DFT and explain how,
by relaxing the so-called strong constraint with a Scherk Schwarz ansatz, one
can obtain backgrounds that simultaneously depend on both the regular and
T-dual coordinates. This provides a purely geometric higher dimensional origin
to gauged supergravities that arise from non-geometric compactification. We
then turn to M-theory and describe recent progress in formulating an E_{n(n)}
U-duality covariant description of the dynamics. We describe how spacetime may
be extended to accommodate coordinates conjugate to brane wrapping modes and
the construction of generalised metrics in this extend space that unite the
bosonic fields of supergravity into a single object. We review the action
principles for these theories and their novel gauge symmetries. We also
describe how a Scherk Schwarz reduction can be applied in the M-theory context
and the resulting relationship to the embedding tensor formulation of maximal
gauged supergravities.

identify new promising $gg$-initiated pair and single production channels and

atmosphere of the Sun. These giant tornadoes appear as dark, elongated and
apparently rotating structures in front of a brighter background. This
phenomenon is thought to be produced by rotating magnetic field structures that
extend throughout the atmosphere. We characterize giant tornadoes through a
statistical analysis of properties like spatial distribution, lifetimes, and
sizes. A total number of 201 giant tornadoes are detected in a period of 25
days, suggesting that on average about 30 events are present across the whole
Sun at a time close to solar maximum. Most tornadoes appear in groups and seem
to form the legs of prominences, thus serving as plasma sources/sinks.
Additional Halpha observations with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope imply that
giant tornadoes rotate as a structure although clearly exhibiting a thread-like
structure. We observe tornado groups that grow prior to the eruption of the
connected prominence. The rotation of the tornadoes may progressively twist the
magnetic structure of the prominence until it becomes unstable and erupts.
Finally, we investigate the potential relation of giant tornadoes to other
phenomena, which may also be produced by rotating magnetic field structures. A
comparison to cyclones, magnetic tornadoes and spicules implies that such
events are more abundant and short-lived the smaller they are. This comparison
might help to construct a power law for the effective atmospheric heating
contribution as function of spatial scale.

localization properties using a locator expansion on general lattices. For 1d
Ising chains, we find non-analytic behavior of the localization length as a
function of energy at \omega = 0, $\xi^{-1}(\omega) = \xi^{-1}(0) + A
|\omega|^\alpha$, with $\alpha$ vanishing at criticality. This contrasts with
the much smoother behavior predicted for XY magnets. We use these results to
approach the ordering transition on Bethe lattices of large connectivity K,
which mimic the limit of high dimensionality. In both models, in the
paramagnetic phase with uniform disorder, the localization length is found to
have a local maximum at \omega = 0. For the Ising model, we find activated
scaling at the phase transition, in agreement with infinite randomness studies.
In the Ising model long range order is found to arise due to a delocalization
and condensation initiated at \omega = 0, without a closing mobility gap. We
find that Ising systems establish order on much sparser (fractal) subgraphs
than XY models. Possible implications of these results for finite-dimensional
systems are discussed.

new polynomial-time algorithms to compute upper bounds on $\alpha_k$. Based on
these new polynomial-time algorithms, we further design a new sandwiching
algorithm, to compute the \emph{exact} $\alpha_k$ with greatly reduced
complexity. When needed, this new sandwiching algorithm also achieves a smooth
tradeoff between computational complexity and result accuracy. Empirical
results show the performance improvements of our algorithm over existing known

spin-1/2 chain has eigenstates displaying localization at the edges. We present
a Bethe ansatz description of this `edge-locking' phenomenon in the entire
\Delta>1 region. We focus on the simplest spin sectors, namely the highly
polarized sectors with only one or two overturned spins, i.e., one-particle and
two-particle sectors. Edge-locking is associated with pure imaginary solutions
of the Bethe equations, which are not commonly encountered in periodic chains.
In the one-particle case, at large anisotropies there are two eigenstates with
imaginary Bethe momenta, related to localization at the two edges. For any
finite chain size, one of the two solutions become real as the anisotropy is
lowered below a certain value. For two particles, a richer scenario is
observed, with eigenstates having the possibility of both particles locked on
the same or different edge, one locked and the other free, and both free either
as single magnons or as bound composites corresponding to `string' solutions.
For finite chains, some of the edge-locked spins get delocalized at certain
values of the anisotropy (`exceptional points'), corresponding to imaginary
solutions becoming real. We characterize these phenomena thoroughly by
providing analytic expansions of the Bethe momenta for large chains, large
anisotropy, and near the exceptional points. In the large-chain limit all the
exceptional points coalesce at the isotropic point (\Delta=1) and edge-locking
becomes stable in the whole \Delta>1 region.

antisymmetry of this state, the rates of the joint decays of the meson pair
display various interesting features, as is well known. As functions of CP and
CPT violating parameters, here we obtain some exact results about the joint
decay rates and their asymmetries for a given time difference defined for joint

each expected to follow two distinct bent M_BH - n relations due to the

relative to the quasar rest frame. The redshifted troughs extend to velocities
up to v=12,000 km/s and the trough widths exceed 3000 km/s in all but one case.
Approximately 1 in 1000 BAL quasars with blueshifted C IV absorption also has
redshifted C IV absorption; objects with C IV absorption present only at
redshifted velocities are roughly four times rarer. In more than half of our
objects, redshifted absorption is seen in C II or Al III as well as C IV,
making low-ionization absorption at least ten times more common among BAL
quasars with redshifted troughs than among standard BAL quasars. However, the C
IV absorption equivalent widths in our objects are on average smaller than
those of standard BAL quasars with low-ionization absorption. We consider
several possible ways of generating redshifted absorption. The two most likely
possibilities may be at work simultaneously, in the same objects or in
different ones. Rotationally dominated outflows seen against a quasar's
extended continuum source can produce redshifted and blueshifted absorption,
but variability consistent with this scenario is seen in only one of the four
objects with multiple spectra. The infall of relatively dense and
low-ionization gas to radii as small as 400 Schwarzschild radii can in
principle explain the observed range of trough profiles, but current models do
not easily explain the origin and survival of such gas. Whatever the origin(s)
of the absorbing gas in these objects, it must be located at small radii to
explain its large redshifted velocities, and thus offers a novel probe of the

calculate pseudo-redshifts for Swift GRBs according to the empirical L-E_p
relationship. Here, such a $L-E_p$ relationship is determined by reconciling
the distributions of pseudo- and real redshifts of redshift-known GRBs. The
values of E_p taken from Butler's GRB catalog are estimated with Bayesian
statistics rather than observed. Using the GRB sample with pseudo-redshifts of
a relatively large number, we fit the redshift-resolved luminosity
distributions of the GRBs with a broken-power-law LF. The fitting results
suggest that the LF could evolve with redshift by a redshift-dependent break
luminosity, e.g., L_b=1.2\times10^{51}(1+z)^2\rm erg s^{-1}. The low- and
high-luminosity indices are constrained to 0.8 and 2.0, respectively. It is
found that the proportional coefficient between GRB event rate and star

deviation from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and Einstein's gravity theory in
a dynamical perspective. Recently, thanks to the measurement of the cosmic
growth rate via the redshift-space distortion, one can understand the evolution
of density contrast through $f\sigma_8(z)$, where $f(z)=d\ln \delta/d \ln a$ is
the growth rate of matter and $\sigma_8(z)$ is the rms amplitude of the density
contrast $\delta$ at the comoving $8h^{-1}$ Mpc scale. In this paper, we use
the redshift space distortion data points to study the growth index on the
bases of Einstein's gravity theory and a modified gravity theory under the
assumption of $f=\Omega_m(a)^{\gamma_L}$. The cosmic background evolution is
fixed by the cosmic observations from the type Ia supernovae SNLS3, cosmic
microwave background radiation data from {\it Planck} and baryon acoustic
oscillations. Via the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, we found the $\gamma_L$
values for Einstein's gravity with a cosmological constant, $w=constant$ dark
energy and a modified gravity theory in the $1,2,3\sigma$ regions respectively:
$0.675_{-0.0662-0.120-0.155}^{+0.0611+0.129+0.178}$,
$0.745_{-0.0819-0.146-0.190}^{+0.0755+0.157+0.205}$ and

gravity theory, the values of growth index $\gamma_L$ show almost $2\sigma$
deviation from the theoretical prediction 6/11 for the $\Lambda$CDM model.
However in the modified gravity framework, a deviation from the Einstein's
relativity is not detected in $1\sigma$ region. That implies that the currently
available cosmic observations don't expect an alternative modified gravity
theory beyond the $\Lambda$CDM model under Einstein's gravity, but that the
simple assumption of $f=\Omega_m^{\gamma_L}$ should be improved.

in machine learning, with many applications including prediction, clustering
and dimensionality reduction. More recently, the framework of copula modeling
has gained popularity due to its modular parametrization of joint
distributions. Among other properties, copulas provide a recipe for combining
flexible models for univariate marginal distributions with parametric families
suitable for potentially high dimensional dependence structures. More
radically, the extended rank likelihood approach of Hoff (2007) bypasses
learning marginal models completely when such information is ancillary to the
learning task at hand as in, e.g., standard dimensionality reduction problems
or copula parameter estimation. The main idea is to represent data by their
observable rank statistics, ignoring any other information from the marginals.
Inference is typically done in a Bayesian framework with Gaussian copulas, and
it is complicated by the fact this implies sampling within a space where the
number of constraints increases quadratically with the number of data points.
The result is slow mixing when using off-the-shelf Gibbs sampling. We present
an efficient algorithm based on recent advances on constrained Hamiltonian
Markov chain Monte Carlo that is simple to implement and does not require
paying for a quadratic cost in sample size.

databases and is now widely applied also in other domains. In this approach,
privacy is protected by the addition of noise to a true (private) value. To
date, this approach to privacy has been proved correct only in the ideal case

semantics. In this paper, we analyze the situation at the implementation level,
where the semantics is necessarily finite-precision, i.e. the representation of
real numbers and the operations on them, are rounded according to some level of
precision. We show that in general there are violations of the differential
privacy property, and we study the conditions under which we can still
guarantee a limited (but, arguably, totally acceptable) variant of the
property, under only a minor degradation of the privacy level. Finally, we
illustrate our results on two cases of noise-generating distributions: the

embedded systems or business processes. Witnesses can help to understand why an
LTL specification is satisfiable, and a number of approaches exist to make
understanding a witness easier. In the case of unsatisfiable specifications
unsatisfiable cores (UCs), i.e., parts of an unsatisfiable formula that are
themselves unsatisfiable, are a well established means for debugging. However,
little work has been done to help understanding a UC of an unsatisfiable LTL
formula. In this paper we suggest to enhance a UC of an unsatisfiable LTL
formula with additional information about the time points at which the
subformulas of the UC are relevant for unsatisfiability. For example, in ""(G p)
and (X not p)"" the first occurrence of ""p"" is really only ""relevant"" for
unsatisfiability at time point 1 (time starts at time point 0). We present a
method to extract such information from the resolution graph of a temporal
resolution proof of unsatisfiability of an LTL formula. We implement our method
in TRP++, and we experimentally evaluate it. Source code of our tool is
available.

states of a multipartite quantum system cannot always be distinguished as well
by local measurements as they can when all quantum measurements are allowed. In
this work, we characterize the distinguishability of sets of multipartite
quantum states when restricted to separable measurements -- those which contain
the class of local measurements but nevertheless are free of entanglement
between the component systems. We consider two quantities: The separable
fidelity -- a truly quantum quantity -- which measures how well we can ""clone""
the input state, and the classical probability of success, which simply gives
the optimal probability of identifying the state correctly.
  We obtain lower and upper bounds on the separable fidelity and give several
examples in the bipartite and multipartite settings where these bounds are
optimal. Moreover the optimal values in these cases can be attained by local
measurements. We further show that for distinguishing orthogonal states under
separable measurements, a strategy that maximizes the probability of success is
also optimal for separable fidelity. We point out that the equality of fidelity
and success probability does not depend on an using optimal strategy, only on
the orthogonality of the states. To illustrate this, we present an example
where two sets (one consisting of orthogonal states, and the other
non-orthogonal states) are shown to have the same separable fidelity even
though the success probabilities are different.

parameter. It is shown that the GSL constraint the temperature of both the
radiation and matter of the Friedmann universe. It is also shown that, even
though the net entropy of the radiation (or matter) is decreasing at
sufficiently large times as the universe expand, it exhibit an increase during
the early times when universe is decelerating. That is the entropy of the
radiation within the comoving volume is decreasing only when the universe has
got an event horizon.

the end-localized states leading to a spin-split gap in neutral ribbons. By
comparing dI/dV maps calculated using the many-body Hubbard model, its

a single-particle description is justified for graphene {\pi} states.
Furthermore, we study the effect of structural defects in the ribbons on their
electronic structure. Defects at one ribbon termini do not significantly modify
the electronic states localized at the intact end. This provides further
evidence for the interpretation of a multi-peaked structure in a recent
scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) experiment resulting from inelastic

that consist of points and lines. The core of Euclidean geometry is the
parallel postulate, which provides the basis of the geometric invariant that
the sum of the angles in every triangle equals $\pi$ and Cramer's rule for
solving simultaneous linear equations. Since the counterpart of parallel
postulate in graph theory is not known, which could be the reason that two
similar problems in graph theory, namely the four color theorem (a topological
invariant) and the solvability of NP-complete problems (discrete simultaneous
equations), remain open to date. In this paper, based on the complex coloring
of cubic graphs, we propose the reducibility postulate of the Petersen
configuration to fill this gap. Comparing edge coloring with a system of linear
equations, we found that the postulate of reducibility in graph theory and the
parallel postulate in Euclidean geometry share some common characteristics of
the plane. First, they both provide solvability conditions on two equations in
the plane. Second, the two basic invariants of the plane, namely the chromatic
index of bridgeless cubic plane graphs and the sum of the angles in every
triangle, can be respectively deduced from them in a straightforward manner.
This reducibility postulation has been verified by more than one hundred
thousand instances of Peterson configurations generated by computer. Despite
that, we still don't have a logical proof of this assertion. Similar to that of
the parallel postulate, we tend to think that describing these natural laws by
even more elementary properties of the plane is inconceivable.

sparse representation-based approach and proposes a new metric called the
\emph{sparse representation-based quality} (SPARQ) \emph{index}. The proposed
method learns the inherent structures of the reference image as a set of basis
vectors, such that any structure in the image can be represented by a linear
combination of only a few of those basis vectors. This sparse strategy is
employed because it is known to generate basis vectors that are qualitatively
similar to the receptive field of the simple cells present in the mammalian
primary visual cortex. The visual quality of the distorted image is estimated
by comparing the structures of the reference and the distorted images in terms
of the learnt basis vectors resembling cortical cells. Our approach is
evaluated on six publicly available subject-rated image quality assessment
datasets. The proposed SPARQ index consistently exhibits high correlation with
the subjective ratings on all datasets and performs better or at par with the

certain known subgroups of people may have high or low correlations in terms of
their membership categories towards each other, and such prior information

Specifically, two scenarios with (a) exact instantaneous and (b) only
statistical CSI are compared with explicit account for both small-scale
Rayleigh fading and path loss due to random inter-node distances. Analytical
results, matching closely to simulations, suggest that although similar
diversity order can be achieved in both cases, the lack of precise CSI to
support relay selection translates into significant increase in the power
required to achieve the same level of QoS. In addition, when only statistical
CSI is available, achieving the same diversity order is associated with a clear
performance degradation at low SNR due to splitting of system resources between
multiple relays.

quasars of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). When the compact dimensions are
smaller in size than the observed universe, topological lensing occurs, in
which multiple images of single objects (ghost images) are observed. We improve
on the recently introduced method to identify ghost images by means of
four-point statistics. Our method is valid for any of the 17 multiply connected
flat models, including nontoroial ones that are compactified by screw motions
or glide reflection. Applying the method to the data revealed one possible case
of topological lensing caused by sixth-turn screw motion, however, it is
consistent with the simply connected model by this test alone. Moreover,
simulations suggest that we cannot exclude the other space models despite the
absence of their signatures. This uncertainty mainly originates from the patchy
coverage of SDSS in the South Galactic cap, and the situation will be improved
by future wide-field spectroscopic surveys.

of the cosmic dark ages. They are presumed to be assembled in so-called
minihaloes with virial temperatures of a few thousand K where collapse is
triggered by molecular hydrogen cooling. A central question concerns their
final masses, and whether fragmentation occurs during their formation. While
studies employing Lagrangian codes suggest fragmentation via a self-gravitating
disk, recent high resolution simulations indicated that disk formation is
suppressed. Here we report the first high-resolution large-eddy simulations
performed with the Eulerian grid-based code Enzo following the evolution beyond
the formation of the first peak, to investigate the accretion of the central
massive clump and potential fragmentation. For a total of 3 halos, we see that
a disk forms around the first clump. The central clump reaches $\sim10$ solar
masses after 40 years, while subsequent accretion is expected at a rate of
$10^{-2}$ solar masses per year. In one of these halos, additional clumps form
as a result of fragmentation which proceeds at larger scales. We note that
subgrid-scale turbulence yields relevant contributions to the stability of the
protostellar disks. We conclude that the first protostar may reach masses up to
$\rm 40-100 M_{\odot}$, which are only limited by the effect of radiative
feedback.

direct proton emission through leakage from the edges of the accelerated

escape, an optically thick source to neutron escape, or a ""direct escape""

The associated neutrino production will be different for each scenario, and we
see that the standard ""one neutrino per cosmic ray"" assumption is valid only in

to the simultaneous generation of inequivalent GHZ and W types of multipartite

the continuous spin rotation symmetry and hence the Goldstone mode. Due to a
near cancellation of the correlation-induced quantum correction terms at
intermediate coupling and optimal band filling relevant for ferromagnetic
manganites, the renormalized magnon energies for the correlated FKLM are nearly
independent of correlation term. Even at higher band fillings, despite

(GIG) family (also known as Halphen Type A family) are likelihood ratio tests,
hence rely on Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation of the three parameters of the
GIG. The particular form of GIG densities, involving modified Bessel functions,
prevents in general from a closed-form expression for ML estimators, which are
obtained at the expense of complex numerical approximation methods. On the
contrary, Method of Moments (MM) estimators allow for concise expressions, but
tests based on these estimators suffer from a lack of efficiency compared to
likelihood ratio tests. This is why, in recent years, trade-offs between ML and
MM estimators have been proposed, resulting in simpler yet not completely
efficient estimators and tests. In the present paper, we do not propose such a
trade-off but rather an optimal combination of both methods, our tests
inheriting efficiency from an ML-like construction and simplicity from the MM
estimators of the nuisance parameters. This goal shall be reached by attacking
the problem from a new angle, namely via the Le Cam methodology. Besides
providing simple efficient testing methods, the theoretical background of this
methodology further allows us to write out explicitly power expressions for our
tests. A Monte Carlo simulation study shows that, also at small sample sizes,
our simpler procedures do at least as good as the complex likelihood ratio
tests. We conclude the paper by applying our findings on two real-data sets.

(12 36-fold segmented high-purity germanium crystals), placed at a distance of

was to study the interaction of neutrons in the segmented high-purity germanium
detectors of AGATA and to investigate the possibility to discriminate neutrons
and gamma rays with the gamma-ray tracking technique. The BaF2 detectors were
used for a time-of-flight measurement, which gave an independent discrimination
of neutrons and gamma rays and which was used to optimise the gamma-ray
tracking-based neutron rejection methods. It was found that standard gamma-ray
tracking, without any additional neutron rejection features, eliminates
effectively most of the interaction points due to recoiling Ge nuclei after
elastic scattering of neutrons. Standard tracking rejects also a significant
amount of the events due to inelastic scattering of neutrons in the germanium
crystals. Further enhancements of the neutron rejection was obtained by setting
conditions on the following quantities, which were evaluated for each event by
the tracking algorithm: energy of the first and second interaction point,
difference in the calculated incoming direction of the gamma ray,
figure-of-merit value. The experimental results of tracking with neutron
rejection agree rather well with Geant4 simulations.

capture image long range dependencies. In a feed-forward architecture, this can
be simply achieved by considering a sufficiently large input context patch,

recurrent convolutional neural network which allows us to consider a large
input context, while limiting the capacity of the model. Contrary to most
standard approaches, our method does not rely on any segmentation methods, nor
any task-specific features. The system is trained in an end-to-end manner over
raw pixels, and models complex spatial dependencies with low inference cost. As
the context size increases with the built-in recurrence, the system identifies

narrow HgTe wires fabricated in quantum wells (QWs) with normal and inverted

only weakly affected by Rashba spin-orbit splitting and persists when the
Rashba splitting is about zero. The WAL signal in wires with normal band
ordering is an order of magnitude smaller than for inverted ones. These
observations are attributed to a Dirac-like topology of the energy bands in
HgTe QWs. From the magnetic-field and temperature dependencies we extract the
dephasing lengths and band Berry phases. The weaker WAL for samples with a
normal band structure can be explained by a non-universal Berry phase which
always exceeds \pi, the characteristic value for gapless Dirac fermions.

another difference resides in the specific geometry of the non-compact limit

the charm quarks from the hot medium is performed at a temperature of
$130\,$MeV and as hadronization mechanism a coalescence approach is chosen.
This model for charm quark interactions with the medium has already been
successfully applied to the study of the medium modification and the elliptic

remains a theoretical challenge. Over the last years, twisted-torus geometries
have been considered both in Newtonian and general-relativistic equilibrium
models, as they represent a potentially good description of neutron star
interiors. All of these works have found an apparent intrinsic limitation to
geometries that are poloidal-field-dominated, with a toroidal-to-poloidal
energy ratio inside the star that are <10%, unless surface currents are
included and magnetic fields are allowed to be discontinuous. This limitation
is in stark contrast with the general expectation that much higher toroidal
fields should be present in the stellar interior and casts doubt about the
stability and hence realism of these configurations. We here discuss how to
overcome this limitation by adopting a new prescription for the azimuthal
currents that leads to magnetized equilibria where the toroidal-to-total
magnetic-field energy ratio can be as high as 90%, thus including geometries
that are toroidal-field-dominated. Moreover, our results show that for a fixed
exterior magnetic-field strength, a higher toroidal-field energy implies a much
higher total magnetic energy stored in the star, with a potentially strong
impact on the expected electromagnetic and gravitational-wave emission from
highly magnetized neutron stars.

(LRT) predicts energy absorption at frequencies of the external driving where
the imaginary part of the appropriate response function is different from zero.
Here we show that, for a fairly general non-linear many-body system on a
lattice subject to an extensive perturbation, this approximation should be
expected to be valid only up to a time $t^*$ depending on the strength of the
driving, beyond which the true coherent Schr\""odinger evolution departs from
the linear response prediction and the system stops absorbing energy form the
driving. We exemplify this phenomenon in detail with the example of a quantum
Ising chain subject to a time-periodic modulation of the transverse field, by
comparing an exact Floquet analysis with the standard results of LRT. In this
context, we also show that if the perturbation is just local, the system is
expected in the thermodynamic limit to keep absorbing energy, and LRT works at
all times. We finally argue more generally the validity of the scenario
presented for closed quantum many-body lattice systems with a bound on the
energy-per-site spectrum, discussing the experimental relevance of our findings

preference maps (OPMs) in the primary visual cortex (V1) of carnivores and
primates can be explained by a so-called statistical connectivity model. This
model assumes that input to V1 neurons is dominated by feed-forward projections
originating from a small set of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). The typical
spacing between adjacent cortical orientation columns preferring the same
orientation then arises via Moir\'{e}-Interference between hexagonal ON/OFF RGC
mosaics. While this Moir\'{e}-Interference critically depends on long-range
hexagonal order within the RGC mosaics, a recent statistical analysis of RGC
receptive field positions found no evidence for such long-range positional
order. Hexagonal order may be only one of several ways to obtain spatially
repetitive OPMs in the statistical connectivity model. Here, we investigate a
more general requirement on the spatial structure of RGC mosaics that can seed
the emergence of spatially repetitive cortical OPMs, namely that angular
correlations between so-called RGC dipoles exhibit a spatial structure similar
to that of OPM autocorrelation functions. Both in cat beta cell mosaics as well
as primate parasol receptive field mosaics we find that RGC dipole angles are
spatially uncorrelated. To help assess the level of these correlations, we
introduce a novel point process that generates mosaics with realistic nearest
neighbor statistics and a tunable degree of spatial correlations of dipole
angles. Using this process, we show that given the size of available data sets,
the presence of even weak angular correlations in the data is very unlikely. We
conclude that the layout of ON/OFF ganglion cell mosaics lacks the spatial
structure necessary to seed iso-orientation domains in the primary visual
cortex.

query is 3-sided if an edge of Q is grounded, giving rise to two variants:
top-open (b_2 = \infty) and left-open (a_1 = -\infty) queries.
  All our results are in external memory under the O(n/B) space budget, for
both the static and dynamic settings:
  * For static P, we give structures that answer top-open queries in O(log_B n
+ k/B), O(loglog_B U + k/B), and O(1 + k/B) I/Os when the universe is R^2, a U
x U grid, and a rank space grid [O(n)]^2, respectively (where k is the number
of reported points). The query complexity is optimal in all cases.
  * We show that the left-open case is harder, such that any linear-size
structure must incur \Omega((n/B)^e + k/B) I/Os for a query. We show that this
case is as difficult as the general 4-sided queries, for which we give a static
structure with the optimal query cost O((n/B)^e + k/B).
  * We give a dynamic structure that supports top-open queries in O(log_2B^e
(n/B) + k/B^1-e) I/Os, and updates in O(log_2B^e (n/B)) I/Os, for any e
satisfying 0 \le e \le 1. This leads to a dynamic structure for 4-sided queries
with optimal query cost O((n/B)^e + k/B), and amortized update cost O(log

version of the fundamental structure priority queue with attrition (PQA). Our
PQA supports FindMin, DeleteMin, and InsertAndAttrite all in O(1) worst case
I/Os, and O(1/B) amortized I/Os per operation.

summary of a few recent results obtained through the application of the formal
theory of partial differential equations and Lie pseudogroups in order to
revisit the mathematical foundations of general relativity. Other engineering
examples (control theory, elasticity theory, electromagnetism) will also be
considered in order to illustrate the three fundamental results that we shall
provide. The paper is therefore divided into three parts corresponding to the
different formal methods used. 1) CARTAN VERSUS VESSIOT: The quadratic terms
appearing in the "" Riemann tensor "" according to the "" Vessiot structure
equations "" must not be identified with the quadratic terms appearing in the
well known "" Cartan structure equations "" for Lie groups and a similar comment
can be done for the "" Weyl tensor "". In particular, "" curvature+torsion""
(Cartan) must not be considered as a generalization of ""curvature alone""
(Vessiot). Roughly, Cartan and followers have not been able to "" quotient down
to the base manifold "", a result only obtained by Spencer in 1970 through the
""nonlinear Spencer sequence"" but in a way quite different from the one followed
by Vessiot in 1903 for the same purpose and still ignored. 2) JANET VERSUS
SPENCER: The "" Ricci tensor "" only depends on the nonlinear transformations
(called "" elations "" by Cartan in 1922) that describe the ""difference ""
existing between the Weyl group (10 parameters of the Poincar\'e subgroup + 1
dilatation) and the conformal group of space-time (15 parameters). It can be
defined by a canonical splitting, that is to say without using the indices
leading to the standard contraction or trace of the Riemann tensor. Meanwhile,
we shall obtain the number of components of the Riemann and Weyl tensors
without any combinatoric argument on the exchange of indices. Accordingly, the
Spencer sequence for the conformal Killing system and its formal adjoint fully
describe the Cosserat/Maxwell/Weyl theory but General Relativity is not
coherent at all with this result. 3) ALGEBRAIC ANALYSIS: Contrary to other
equations of physics (Cauchy equations, Cosserat equations, Maxwell equations),
the Einstein equations cannot be "" parametrized "", that is the generic solution
cannot be expressed by means of the derivatives of a certain number of
arbitrary potential-like functions, solving therefore negatively a 1000 $
challenge proposed by J. Wheeler in 1970. Accordingly, the mathematical
foundations of mathematical physics must be revisited within this formal
framework, though striking it may look like for certain apparently well
established theories such as electromagnetism and general relativity. We insist
on the fact that the arguments presented are of a purely mathematical nature
and are thus unavoidable.

finite-intersection weights our lower and upper error bounds match and show
that our changing dimension algorithms are optimal in the sense that they
achieve convergence rates arbitrarily close to the best possible convergence

coupling between the atomic magnetic moment and external magnetic fields. A
spatially dependent pulsed magnetic field acts as an internal-state-dependent

lattice-ordered abelian groups -- through the lens of Stone-Priestley duality,
using canonical extensions as an essential tool. Specifically, the theory of
canonical extensions implies that the (Stone-Priestley) dual spaces of
MV-algebras carry the structure of topological partial commutative ordered
semigroups. We use this structure to obtain two different decompositions of
such spaces, one indexed over the prime MV-spectrum, the other over the maximal
MV-spectrum. These decompositions yield sheaf representations of MV-algebras,
using a new and purely duality-theoretic result that relates certain sheaf
representations of distributive lattices to decompositions of their dual
spaces. Importantly, the proofs of the MV-algebraic representation theorems
that we obtain in this way are distinguished from the existing work on this
topic by the following features: (1) we use only basic algebraic facts about
MV-algebras; (2) we show that the two aforementioned sheaf representations are
special cases of a common result, with potential for generalizations; and (3)
we show that these results are strongly related to the structure of the
Stone-Priestley duals of MV-algebras. In addition, using our analysis of these
decompositions, we prove that MV-algebras with isomorphic underlying lattices
have homeomorphic maximal MV-spectra. This result is an MV-algebraic
generalization of a classical theorem by Kaplansky stating that two compact
Hausdorff spaces are homeomorphic if, and only if, the lattices of continuous
[0, 1]-valued functions on the spaces are isomorphic.

fundamentally related to landscapes with multiple embedded funnels. Here we
present analytical tools to detect and compare structural repetitions in
protein molecules. By an exhaustive analysis of the distribution of structural
repeats using a robust metric we define those portions of a protein molecule
that best describe the overall structure as a tessellation of basic units. The
patterns produced by such tessellations provide intuitive representations of
the repeating regions and their association towards higher order arrangements.
We find that some protein architectures can be described as nearly periodic,
while in others clear separations between repetitions exist. Since the method
is independent of amino acid sequence information we can identify structural
units that can be encoded by a variety of distinct amino acid sequences.

excess sources in the Herschel OTKP DUNES have been seen to show significant -
and in some cases extended - excess emission at 160{\mu}m, which is larger than
the 100{\mu}m excess. This excess emission has been suggested to stem from
debris disks colder than those known previously. Using several methods, we
re-consider whether some or even all of the candidates may be associated with
unrelated galactic or extragalactic emission and conclude that it is highly
unlikely that none of the candidates represents a true circumstellar disk. For
true disks, both the dust temperatures inferred from the SEDs and the disk
radii estimated from the images suggest that the dust is nearly as cold as a
blackbody. This requires the grains to be larger than ~100{\mu}m, regardless of
their material composition. To explain the dearth of small grains, we explore
several conceivable scenarios: transport-dominated disks, disks of low
dynamical excitation, and disks of unstirred primordial macroscopic grains. Our
qualitative analysis and collisional simulations rule out the first two of
these scenarios, but show the feasibility of the third one. We show that such
disks can survive for gigayears, largely preserving the primordial size
distribution. They should be composed of macroscopic solids larger than
millimeters, but smaller than kilometers in size. Thus planetesimal formation,
at least in the outer regions of the systems, has stopped before ""cometary"" or

by means of the generalized order bounds, which are described in terms of a
certain Weierstrass semigroup. The asymptotical behaviour of such bounds for r

Feng-Rao numbers. This paper is addressed to compute the Feng-Rao numbers for
numerical semigroups of embedding dimension two (with two generators),
obtaining a closed simple formula for the general case by using numerical
semigroup techniques. These involve the computation of the Ap\'ery set with
respect to an integer of the semigroups under consideration. The formula
obtained is applied to lower-bounding the generalized Hamming weights,
improving the bound given by Kirfel and Pellikaan in terms of the classical
Feng-Rao distance. We also compare our bound with a modification of the
Griesmer bound, improving this one in many cases.

the free electron model in metal conductors placed in an external electric
field, is presented, systematically analyzed and empirically studied in this
paper. The free electron model considers that electrons have both a thermal and
a drift motion in a conductor that is placed in an external electric field. The
motivation of the RDPSO algorithm is described first, and the velocity equation
of the particle is designed by simulating the thermal motion as well as the
drift motion of the electrons, both of which lead the electrons to a location
with minimum potential energy in the external electric field. Then, a
comprehensive analysis of the algorithm is made, in order to provide a deep
insight into how the RDPSO algorithm works. It involves a theoretical analysis
and the simulation of the stochastic dynamical behavior of a single particle in
the RDPSO algorithm. The search behavior of the algorithm itself is also
investigated in detail, by analyzing the interaction between the particles.
Some variants of the RDPSO algorithm are proposed by incorporating different
random velocity components with different neighborhood topologies. Finally,
empirical studies on the RDPSO algorithm are performed by using a set of
benchmark functions from the CEC2005 benchmark suite. Based on the theoretical
analysis of the particle's behavior, two methods of controlling the algorithmic
parameters are employed, followed by an experimental analysis on how to select
the parameter values, in order to obtain a good overall performance of the
RDPSO algorithm and its variants in real-world applications. A further
performance comparison between the RDPSO algorithms and other variants of PSO
is made to prove the efficiency of the RDPSO algorithms.

estimators of expertise based on a multisensor data fusion framework together
with the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence and Shannon's entropy. More
specifically, we defined three sensors which detect heterogeneous information
derived from the textual contents, from the graph structure of the citation
patterns for the community of experts, and from profile information about the
academic experts. Given the evidences collected, each sensor may define
different candidates as experts and consequently do not agree in a final
ranking decision. To deal with these conflicts, we applied the Dempster-Shafer
theory of evidence combined with Shannon's Entropy formula to fuse this
information and come up with a more accurate and reliable final ranking list.
Experiments made over two datasets of academic publications from the Computer
Science domain attest for the adequacy of the proposed approach over the
traditional state of the art approaches. We also made experiments against
representative supervised state of the art algorithms. Results revealed that
the proposed method achieved a similar performance when compared to these
supervised techniques, confirming the capabilities of the proposed framework.

scheme on general meshes to simulate the two compressible phase flow in porous
media. The diffusion term, which can be anisotropic and heterogeneous, is
discretized by piecewise linear nonconforming triangular finite elements. The
other terms are discretized by means of a cell-centered finite volume scheme on
a dual mesh, where the dual volumes are constructed around the sides of the
original mesh. The relative permeability of each phase is decentred according
the sign of the velocity at the dual interface. This technique also ensures the
validity of the discrete maximum principle for the saturation under a non
restrictive shape regularity of the space mesh and the positiveness of all
transmissibilities. Next, a priori estimates on the pressures and a function of
the saturation that denote capillary terms are established. These stabilities
results lead to some compactness arguments based on the use of the Kolmogorov
compactness theorem, and allow us to derive the convergence of a subsequence of
the sequence of approximate solutions to a weak solution of the continuous
equations, provided the mesh size tends to zero. The proof is given for the
complete system when the density of the each phase depends on the own pressure.

Gyr ago, where L_0 is the present-day one, if the heliocentric distance r of

as I_Ar = 0.82 I_0. It would allowed for a liquid ocean on the terrestrial
surface which, otherwise, would have been frozen, contrary to the empirical
evidence. By further assuming that some physical mechanism subsequently
displaced the Earth towards its current distance in such a way that the
irradiance stayed substantially constant over the entire Archean from 3.8 Gyr
to 2.5 Gyr ago, a relative recession rate as large as \dot r/r \simeq 3.4 x
10^-11 yr^-1 would have been required. Although such a figure is roughly of the
same order of magnitude of the value of the Hubble parameter 3.8 Gyr ago H_Ar =
1.192 H_0 = 8.2 x 10^-11 yr^-1, standard general relativity rules out
cosmological explanations for the hypothesized Earth' s recession rate.
Instead, a class of modified theories of gravitation with nonminimal coupling
between the matter and the metric naturally predicts a secular variation of the
relative distance of a localized two-body system, thus yielding a potentially
viable candidate to explain the putative recession of the Earth' s orbit.
Another competing mechanism of classical origin which could, in principle,
allow for the desired effect is the mass loss which either the Sun or the Earth
itself may have experienced during the Archean. On the one hand, this implies
that our planet should have lost 2% of its present mass in the form of
eroded/evaporated hydrosphere which, thus, should have been two orders of
magnitude larger than now. On the other hand, it is widely believed that the
Sun could have lost mass at an enhanced rate due to a stronger solar wind in
the past for not more than \sim 0.2-0.3 Gyr.

featuring finite normal stress differences, is developed. This work offers new
insights for the interpretation of planetary survey data. Evolution equations
for poloidal and toroidal motions include gradients of density, viscosity, and
two normal stress moduli. The poloidal field exhibits gradients in the cubic
dilation, which couple non-isotropic pressures to the combined deformation
field. In contrast, the toroidal field exhibits vorticity gradients with
magnitudes proportional to the natural time. This holds even in the absence of
material gradients. Consequently, viscosity gradients are not required to drive
toroidal motions. The toroidal field is governed by an inhomogeneous diharmonic
equation, exhibiting dynamic shear localization. The strain-energy density for
this model, as a function of temperature, is found via thermodynamics. Assuming
heat transfer with characteristic diffusivity, a radial model parameterized by
thermomechanical competence is found. Shear dislocations, admissible for
thermomechanical competence greater than 1/2, are found to coincide with
supershear rupture speeds for in-plane (Mode II) cracks. This range of
thermomechanical competence coincides with depths in the crust, upper mantle
and transition zone where earthquake foci are observed. Consequently, all
seismic sources must exhibit some supershearing component. Observed variations
in Earth's gravity-topography admittance and correlation spectra, and
earthquake moment-depth release are interpreted in light of this hypothetical

the Very Large Telescope for a sample of 15 Blue Straggler Stars (BSSs) in the
globular cluster (GC) M30. The targets have been selected to sample the two BSS
sequences discovered, with 7 BSSs along the blue sequence and 8 along the red
one. No difference in the kinematical properties of the two groups of BSSs has
been found. In particular, almost all the observed BSSs have projected
rotational velocity lower than ~30 km/s, with only one (blue) fast rotating BSS
(>90 km/s), identified as a W UMa binary. This rotational velocity distribution
is similar to those obtained in 47 Tucanae and NGC 6397, while M4 remains the
only GC studied so far harboring a large fraction of fast rotating BSSs. All
stars hotter than ~7800 K (regardless of the parent BSS sequence) show iron
abundances larger than those measured from normal cluster stars, with a
clearcut trend with the effective temperature. This behaviour suggests that
particle trasport mechanisms driven by radiative levitation occur in the
photosphere of these stars, as already observed for the BSSs in NGC 6397.
Finally, 4 BSSs belonging to the red sequence (not affected by radiative
levitation) show a strong depletion of [O/Fe], with respect to the abundance
measured in Red Giant Branch and Horizontal Branch stars. This O-depletion is
compatible with the chemical signature expected in BSSs formed by mass transfer
processes in binary systems, in agreement with the mechanism proposed for the
formation of BSSs in the red sequence.

technically unlimited number of volunteer machines distributed over large
physical distances. However various problems exist deploying applications over
these heterogeneous machines using BOINC: applications must be ported to each
machine architecture type, the project server must be trusted to supply
authentic applications, applications that do not regularly checkpoint may lose
execution progress upon volunteer machine termination and applications that
have dependencies may find it difficult to run under BOINC.
  To solve such problems we introduce virtual BOINC, or V-BOINC, where virtual
machines are used to run computations on volunteer machines. Application
developers can then compile their applications on a single architecture,
checkpointing issues are solved through virtualization API's and many security
concerns are addressed via the virtual machine's sandbox environment. In this
paper we focus on outlining a unique approach on how virtualization can be
introduced into BOINC and demonstrate that V-BOINC offers acceptable
computational performance when compared to regular BOINC. Finally we show that
applications with dependencies can easily run under V-BOINC in turn increasing

Further, we demonstrate the separation of modes in the angular position basis,
which is mutually unbiased with respect to the OAM basis. The high degree of
certainty achieved by our method makes it particu- larly attractive for
enhancing the information capacity of multi-level quantum cryptography systems.

(1<z<2), low-frequency selected (and so unbiased in orientation) 3CRR radio
sources are reported. The sample includes 21 quasars (= broad line radio
galaxies) and 17 narrow line radio galaxies (NLRGs) with matched 178 MHz radio
luminosity (log L_R ~ 44-45). The quasars have high radio core-fraction, high
X-ray luminosities (log L_X ~ 45-46) and soft X-ray hardness ratios (HR ~ -0.5)
indicating low obscuration. The NLRGs have lower core-fraction, lower apparent
X-ray luminosities (log L_X ~ 43-45) and mostly hard X-ray hardness ratios
(HR>0) indicating obscuration (log N_H ~ 22-24 cm^-2). These properties and the
correlation between obscuration and radio core-fraction are consistent with
orientation-dependent obscuration as in Unification models. About half the
NLRGs have soft X-ray hardness ratios and/or high [OIII] emission line to X-ray
luminosity ratio suggesting obscuration by Compton thick (CT) material so that
scattered nuclear or extended X-ray emission dominates (as in NGC1068). The
ratios of unobscured to Compton-thin (10^{22}< N_H(int) < 1.5 x 10^{24} cm^-2)
to CT (N_H(int) > 1.5 x 10^{24} cm^-2) is 2.5:1.4:1 in this high luminosity,
radio-selected sample. The obscured fraction is 0.5, higher than is typically
reported for AGN at comparable luminosities from multi-wavelength surveys
(0.1-0.3). Assuming random nuclear orientation, the unobscured half-opening
angle of the disk/wind/torus structure is ~ 60deg and the obscuring material
covers 30deg of which ~ 12deg is Compton thick. The multi-wavelength properties
reveal that many NLRGs have intrinsic absorption 10-1000x higher than indicated
by their X-ray hardness ratios, and their true L_X values are ~10--100x larger
than the hardness-ratio absorption corrections would indicate.

structure of quantum systems in an algebraic framework which eliminates certain
conceptual and computational difficulties of the conventional approaches.
Relying on the Heisenberg picture it is based on the resolvents of the basic
canonically conjugate operators and covers finite and infinite quantum systems.
The resulting C*-algebras, the resolvent algebras, have many desirable
properties. On one hand they encode specific information about the dimension of
the respective quantum system and have the mathematically comfortable feature
of being nuclear, and for finite dimensional systems they are even postliminal.
This comes along with a surprisingly simple structure of their representations.
On the other hand, they are a convenient framework for the study of interacting
as well as constrained quantum systems since they allow the direct application
of C*-algebraic methods which often simplify the analysis. Some pertinent facts
are illustrated by instructive examples.

  Communication",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In network MIMO cellular systems, subsets of base stations (BSs), or remote
radio heads, are connected via backhaul links to central units (CUs) that
perform joint encoding in the downlink and joint decoding in the uplink.
Focusing on the uplink, an effective solution for the communication between BSs
and the corresponding CU on the backhaul links is based on compressing and
forwarding the baseband received signal from each BS. In the presence of
ergodic fading, communicating the channel state information (CSI) from the BSs
to the CU may require a sizable part of the backhaul capacity. In a prior work,
this aspect was studied by assuming a Compress-Forward-Estimate (CFE) approach,
whereby the BSs compress the training signal and CSI estimation takes place at
the CU. In this work, instead, an Estimate-Compress-Forward (ECF) approach is
investigated, whereby the BSs perform CSI estimation and forward a compressed
version of the CSI to the CU. This choice is motivated by the information
theoretic optimality of separate estimation and compression. Various ECF
strategies are proposed that perform either separate or joint compression of
estimated CSI and received signal. Moreover, the proposed strategies are
combined with distributed source coding when considering multiple BSs.
""Semi-coherent"" strategies are also proposed that do not convey any CSI or
training information on the backhaul links. Via numerical results, it is shown
that a proper design of ECF strategies based on joint received signal and
estimated CSI compression or of semi-coherent schemes leads to substantial
performance gains compared to more conventional approaches based on
non-coherent transmission or the CFE approach.

the corners, and the curvature are regulated by point separation either in the
direction of the axis of the cylinder or in the (Euclidean) time; the full
divergence structure is isolated, and the remaining finite energy and torque
are extracted. Formally, only the regulator based on axis splitting yields the
expected balance between energy and torque. Because of the logarithmic
curvature divergences, there is an ambiguity in the linear dependence of the

removed by a process of renormalization, the expected torque-energy balance is

draws attention to the characteristic instability of solutions to the third
order equation of motion. He remarks that changing the sign of the self-force
eliminates the runaway solutions and gives `reasonable behaviour'. Dirac
rejects such a change and proceeds with an ad hoc modification to the solutions
of the initial value problem that is not consistent with the principle of
causality. We argue that his reasons for rejecting the change of sign are
invalid on both physical and mathematical grounds.
  The conceptual shift is to treat the physical particle as a composite of the
source particle and the energy-momentum that is reversibly generated in its
self-field by its motion. The reversibly generated energy in the self-field is
interpreted as kinetic energy, and the changes that follow result in Dirac's
change of sign. Several exact solutions to the new equation of motion and its
linearisation are given. For a particle in orbital motion the self-force
enables the applied force to generate radiation and kinetic energy in the
self-field that results in an outward spiral motion. The theory is consistent
with all well-established principles of physics, including the principle of
causality.

with other methods and powered by existing software Thue equations solvers, it
allows one to efficiently compute integral points on biquadratic curves.
  We illustrate this approach with a particular application of finding
near-multiples of squares in Lucas sequences. As an example, we establish that
among Fibonacci numbers only 2 and 34 are of the form 2m^2+2; only 1, 13, and
1597 are of the form m^2-3; and so on.

the self-force in this way for the case of a scalar charge in Schwarzschild

uses the Hadamard form for the Green function in order to render regularization

illustrative toy-model for the gravitational case, which serves to model
astrophysical binary systems in the extreme mass-ratio limit.

the Dn(4000) parameter and colour index and also analyse different global
properties of these systems as total star formation activity and global
colours. We calculate the probability that the properties of galaxies in
triplets are strongly correlated. We define the triplet compactness as a
measure of the percentage of the system total area that is filled by the light
of member galaxies. Our analysis suggest that triplet galaxy members behave
similarly to compact group members and galaxies in rich clusters. We also find
that systems comprising 3 blue, star-forming, young stellar population galaxies
(blue triplets) are most probably real systems and not a chance configuration
of interloping galaxies. The same holds for triplets composed by 3 red, non
star-forming galaxies, showing the correlation of galaxy properties in these
systems. From the analysis of the triplet as a whole, we conclude that, at a
given total SM content, triplets show a total star formation activity and
global colours similar to compact groups. However, blue triplets show a high
total star formation activity with a lower SM content. From an analysis of the
compactness parameter of the systems we find that light is even more
concentrated in triplets than in compact groups. We propose that triplets

burst (GRB) explosions and energetics, but is still, even after more than a
decade of extensive studies, not fully understood. This is largely related to
two phenomena: a dust-extinction bias, that prevented high-mass and thus likely
high-metallicity GRB hosts to be detected in the first place, and a lack of
efficient instrumentation, that limited spectroscopic studies including
metallicity measurements to the low-redshift end of the GRB host population.
The subject of this work is the very energetic GRB 110918A, for which we
measure a redshift of z=0.984. GRB 110918A gave rise to a luminous afterglow
with an intrinsic spectral slope of b=0.70, which probed a sight-line with
little extinction (A_V=0.16 mag) typical of the established distributions of
afterglow properties. Photometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations of
the galaxy hosting GRB 110918A, including optical/NIR photometry with GROND and
spectroscopy with VLT/X-shooter, however, reveal an all but average GRB host in
comparison to the z~1 galaxies selected through similar afterglows to date. It
has a large spatial extent with a half-light radius of ~10 kpc, the highest
stellar mass for z<1.9 (log(M_*/M_sol) = 10.68+-0.16), and an Halpha-based star
formation rate of 41 M_sol/yr. We measure a gas-phase extinction of ~1.8 mag
through the Balmer decrement and one of the largest host-integrated
metallicities ever of around solar (12 + log(O/H) = 8.93+/-0.13). This presents
one of the very few robust metallicity measurements of GRB hosts at z~1, and
establishes that GRB hosts at z~1 can also be very metal rich. It conclusively
rules out a metallicity cut-off in GRB host galaxies and argues against an
anti-correlation between metallicity and energy release in GRBs.

effects of baryonic feedback on the density profiles of dark matter (DM)
haloes. The sample covers a wide mass range: 9.4e9<Mhalo/Msun<7.8e11, hosting
galaxies with stellar masses: 5.0e5<M*/Msun<8.3e10, i.e. from dwarf to L*. The
galaxies are simulated with several baryonic prescriptions, including a range
of stellar feedbacks. The main result is a clear dependence of the inner slope
of the DM density profile, \alpha\ in \rho r^\alpha, on the ratio between
stellar-to-halo mass (M*/Mhalo). This relation is independent of the stellar
feedback scheme, allowing a prediction for cusp vs core formation. When
M*/Mhalo is low, ~0.01%, energy from stellar feedback is insufficient to
significantly alter the inner DM density and the galaxy retains a cuspy
profile. At higher M*/Mhalo, feedback drives the expansion of the DM and
generates cored profiles. The flattest profiles form where M*/Mhalo~0.5%. Above
this ratio, stars formed in the central regions deepen the gravitational
potential enough to oppose this supernova-driven expansion process, resulting
in smaller cores and cuspier profiles. Combining the dependence of \alpha\ on
M*/Mhalo with the abundance matching relation between M* and Mhalo provides a
prediction for how \alpha\ varies with M*. Further, using the Tully-Fisher
relation allows a prediction for the dependence of the DM inner slope on the
observed rotation velocity of galaxies. The most cored galaxies are expected to
have Vrot~50km/s, with \alpha\ decreasing for more massive disc galaxies:
spirals with Vrot~150km/s have central slopes \alpha<-0.8, approaching the NFW
profile. This novel prediction for the dependence of \alpha\ on disc galaxy
mass can be tested using current observational data sets, and can be applied to
theoretical modeling of mass profiles and populations of disc galaxies.

Constraints can be imposed on the nature of past accretion events based on the
currently observed X-ray reflection from the molecular clouds. We discuss
accretion of clouds in the context of enhanced activity of Sgr A* during the
past few hundred years. We put forward a scenario according to which gas clouds
bring material close to the horizon of the black hole on <~0.1 parsec scale. We
have modelled the source intrinsic luminosity assuming that multiple events
occur at various moments in time. These events are characterized by the amount
of accreted material and the distribution of angular momentum. We parameterized
the activity in the form of a sequence of discrete events, followed the viscous
evolution, and calculated the luminosity of the system from the time-dependent
accretion rate across the inner boundary. Accreting clumps settle near a
circularization radius, spread there during the viscous time, and subsequently
feed the black hole over a certain period. A significant enhancement (by factor
of ten) of the luminosity is only expected if the viscous timescale of the
inflow is very short. On the other hand, the increase in source activity is
expected to be much less prominent if the latter timescale is longer and a
considerable fraction of the material does not reach the centre. A solution is
obtained under two additional assumptions: (i) the radiative efficiency is a
decreasing function of the Eddington ratio; (ii) the viscous decay of the
luminosity proceeds somewhat faster than the canonical L(t)~t^{-5/3} profile.
We applied our scheme to the case of G2 cloud in the Galactic centre to obtain

extremely well reproduced by a power-law model having the same velocity
dispersion, but with predictions for the Hubble constant that deviate by $\sim
20%$. Hence we conclude that the impact of degeneracies between parametrized
models have been underestimated in current $H_0$ measurements from lensing, and
need to be carefully reconsidered.

ionization in the outermost and densest regions of protoplanetary disks;
however, it is unknown to what degree they are physically present. As is
observed in the Solar System, stellar winds can inhibit the propagation of
cosmic rays within the circumstellar environment and subsequently into the
disk. In this work, we explore the hitherto neglected effects of cosmic ray
modulation by both stellar winds and magnetic field structures and study how
these processes act to reduce disk ionization rates. We construct a
two-dimensional protoplanetary disk model of a T-Tauri star system, focusing on
ionization from stellar and interstellar FUV, stellar X-ray photons, and cosmic
rays. We show that stellar winds can power a Heliosphere-like analogue, i.e., a
""T-Tauriosphere,"" diminishing cosmic ray ionization rates by several orders of
magnitude at low to moderate CR energies (E_CR<1 GeV). We explore models of
both the observed solar wind cosmic ray modulation and a highly simplified
estimate for ""elevated"" cosmic ray modulation as would be expected from a young
T-Tauri star. In the former (solar analogue) case, we estimate the ionization
rate from galactic cosmic rays to be zeta_CR~(0.23-1.4) x 1e-18 s^-1. This
range of values, which we consider to be the maximum CR ionization rate for the
disk, is more than an order of magnitude lower than what is generally assumed
in current models for disk chemistry and physics. In the latter case, i.e., for
a ""T-Tauriosphere,"" the ionization rate by cosmic rays is zeta_CR<1e-20 s^-1,
which is 1000 times smaller than the interstellar value. Indeed, if winds are
as efficient at cosmic ray modulation as predicted here, short-lived
radionuclides (now extinct) would have provided the major source of ionization
(zeta_RN~7.3e-19 s^-1) in the planet-forming zone of the young Solar Nebula.

A total of 19 galaxies have photometry available in all the IRAC/Spitzer bands.
Of these, 3 AGN candidates were not classified as AGN in the optical diagrams,
suggesting they are dusty/obscured AGNs, or that nuclear star formation has

density (\Sigma_{SFR}) and stellar mass surface density per time unit

both quantities are larger for higher redshift galaxies. We also studied the
SFR and SSFR versus stellar mass and color relations, with the more massive

luminosity (L_X), assumed to originate from X-ray binaries (XRBs), and star
formation rate (SFR) in UV-selected z<0.1 Lyman break analogs (LBAs). We
present Chandra observations for four new GALEX-selected LBAs. Including
previously studied LBAs, Haro 11 and VV 114, we find that LBAs demonstrate
L_X/SFR ratios that are elevated by ~1.5sigma compared to local galaxies,
similar to the ratios found for stacked LBGs in the early Universe (z>2). We
show that these LBAs are unlikely to harbor AGN, based on their optical and
X-ray spectra and the spatial distribution of the X-rays in three spatially
extended cases. We expect that high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) dominate the
X-ray emission in these galaxies, based on their high specific SFRs
(sSFRs=SFR/M* > 10^{-9}/yr), which suggest the prevalence of young stellar
populations. Since both LBAs and LBGs have lower dust attenuations and
metallicities compared to similar samples of more typical local galaxies, we
investigate the effects of dust extinction and metallicity on the L_X/SFR for
the broader population of galaxies with high sSFRs (>10^{-10}/yr). The
estimated dust extinctions (corresponding to column densities of
N_H<10^{22}/cm^2) are expected to have insignificant effects on observed
L_X/SFR ratio for the majority of galaxy samples. We find that the observed
relationship between L_X/SFR and metallicity appears consistent with
theoretical expectations from X-ray binary population synthesis models.
Therefore, we conclude that lower metallicities, related to more luminous HMXBs
such as ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), drive the elevated L_X/SFR observed
in our sample of z<0.1 LBAs. The relatively metal-poor, active mode of star
formation in LBAs and distant z>2 LBGs may yield higher total HMXB luminosity
than found in typical galaxies in the local Universe.

90 ks Chandra observations, we confirm the presence of a western X-ray cavity
or bubble, and report on a newly discovered eastern X-ray cavity. The total
mechanical power associated with these AGN-driven outflows is (22+/-9)*10^44
erg/s, and is sufficient to offset the cooling, indicating that AGN feedback
still provides a viable solution to the cooling flow problem even in the
strongest cool core clusters. Based on the distribution of the optical
filaments, as well as a jet-like structure seen in the 325 MHz VLA radio map,
we suggest that the cluster harbours older outflows along the north to south
direction. The jet of the central AGN is therefore either precessing or
sloshing-induced motions have caused the outflows to change directions. There
are also hints of an X-ray depression to the north aligned with the 325 MHz
jet-like structure, which might represent the highest redshift ghost cavity
discovered to date. We further find evidence of a cold front (r=65kpc) that
coincides with the outermost edge of the western X-ray cavity and the edge of
the radio mini-halo. The common location of the cold front with the edge of the
radio mini-halo supports the idea that the latter originates from electrons
being reaccelerated due to sloshing induced turbulence. Alternatively, its
coexistence with the edge of the X-ray cavity may be due to cool gas being
dragged out by the outburst. We confirm that the central AGN is highly
sub-Eddington and conclude that a >10^10M_Sun or a rapidly spinning black hole
is favoured to explain both the radiative-inefficiency of the AGN and the
powerful X-ray cavities.

distribution of their sources. Data from CR observations are yet inconclusive
about their exact location or distribution, but provide a measure for the
average local density of these emitters. Due to the discreteness of the
emitters the flux is expected to show ensemble fluctuations on top of the
statistical variations, a reflection of the cosmic variance. This effect is
strongest for the most energetic cosmic rays due to the limited propagation
distance in the cosmic radiation background and is hence a local phenomenon. In
this work we study the sensitivity of the JEM-EUSO space mission to ensemble
fluctuations on the assumption of uniform distribution of sources, with local
source density \sim 10^{-5} Mpc^{-3}. We show that in 3 years of observation
JEM-EUSO will be able to probe ensemble fluctuations if the nearest sources are
at 3 Mpc, and that after 10 years orbiting the Earth, this pathfinder mission
will become sensitive to ensemble fluctuations if the nearest sources are 10
Mpc away. The study of spectral fluctuations from the local source
distributions are complementary to but independent of cosmic ray anisotropy
studies.

backwards towards big-bang, the scalar undergoes wilder oscillations, with the
steep potential pushing it back at every passage and not allowing the scalar to
escape to infinity. Whereas it was pointed out earlier that there are possible
implications of the climbing phase to CMB, we point out here another potential
application, to the issue of initial conditions in inflation.

in explaining cosmic structure over an enormous span of redshift, but it has
faced persistent challenges from observations that probe the innermost regions

satellites. We review the current observational and theoretical status of these
""small scale controversies."" Cosmological simulations that incorporate only
gravity and collisionless CDM predict halos with abundant substructure and
central densities that are too high to match constraints from galaxy dynamics.
The solution could lie in baryonic physics: recent numerical simulations and
analytic models suggest that gravitational potential fluctuations tied to
efficient supernova feedback can flatten the central cusps of halos in massive
galaxies, and a combination of feedback and low star-formation efficiency could
explain why most of the dark matter subhalos orbiting the Milky Way do not host
visible galaxies. However, it is not clear that this solution can work in the
lowest mass galaxies where discrepancies are observed. Alternatively, the
small-scale conflicts could be evidence of more complex physics in the dark
sector itself. For example, elastic scattering from strong dark matter
self-interactions can alter predicted halo mass profiles, leading to good
agreement with observations across a wide range of galaxy mass. Gravitational
lensing and dynamical perturbations of tidal streams in the stellar halo
provide evidence for an abundant population of low mass subhalos in accord with
CDM predictions. These observational approaches will get more powerful over the
next few years.

In this paper, we analyze five widely studied models (Quantal Response
Equilibrium, Level-k, Cognitive Hierarchy, QLk, and Noisy Introspection) that
aim to describe actual, rather than idealized, human behavior in such games. We
performed what we believe is the most comprehensive meta-analysis of these
models, leveraging ten different data sets from the literature recording human
play of two-player games. We began by evaluating the models' generalization or
predictive performance, asking how well a model fits unseen test data after
having had its parameters calibrated based on separate training data.
Surprisingly, we found that what we dub the QLk model of Stahl & Wilson (1994)
consistently achieved the best performance. Motivated by this finding, we
describe methods for analyzing the posterior distributions over a model's
parameters. We found that QLk's parameters were being set to values that were
not consistent with their intended economic interpretations. We thus explored
variations of QLk, ultimately identifying a new model family that has fewer
parameters, gives rise to more parsimonious parameter values, and achieves
better predictive performance.

posits that when a quantum system has a nonlinear response at the fundamental
limit, only three energy eigenstates contribute to the first and second
hyperpolarizability. This is called the three-level ansatz and is the only
unproven assumption in the theory of fundamental limits. All calculations that
are based on direct solution of the Schrodinger equation yield intrinsic
hyperpolarizabilities less than 0.709 and intrinsic second
hyperpolarizabilities less than 0.6. In this work, we show that relaxing the
three-level ansatz and allowing an arbitrary number of states to contribute
leads to divergence of the optimized intrinsic hyperpolarizability in the limit
of an infinite number of states - what we call the many-state catastrophe. This
is not surprising given that the divergent systems are most likely not
derivable from the Schrodinger equation, yet obey the sum rules. The sums rules
are the second ingredient in limit theory, and apply also to systems with more
general Hamiltonians. These exotic Hamiltonians may not model any real systems
found in nature. Indeed, a class of transition moments and energies that come
form the sum rules do not have a corresponding Hamiltonian that is expressible
in differential form. In this work, we show that the three-level ansatz acts as
a constraint that excludes many of the nonphysical Hamiltonians and prevents
the intrinsic hyperpolarizability from diverging. We argue that this implies
that the true fundamental limit is smaller than previously calculated. Since
the three-level ansatz does not lead to the largest possible nonlinear
response, contrary to its assertion, we propose the intriguing possibility that
the three-level ansatz is true for any system that obeys the Schrodinger
equation, yet this assertion may be unprovable.

highly desirable for analysis. We present a compositional state space model for
estimation of an investment portfolio's unobserved asset allocation weightings
on a set of candidate assets when the only observed information is the time
series of portfolio returns and the candidate asset returns. In this paper, we
exhibit both sequential Monte Carlo numerical and conditionally Normal
analytical approaches to solve for estimates of the unobserved asset weight
time series. This methodology is motivated by the estimation of monthly asset
class weights on the aggregate hedge fund industry from 1996 to 2012.
Furthermore, we show how to implement the results as predictive investment
weightings in order to construct hedge fund replicating portfolios.

poorly-understood states and actions to encourage exploration. We study an
alternative approach for efficient exploration, posterior sampling for
reinforcement learning (PSRL). This algorithm proceeds in repeated episodes of
known duration. At the start of each episode, PSRL updates a prior distribution
over Markov decision processes and takes one sample from this posterior. PSRL
then follows the policy that is optimal for this sample during the episode. The
algorithm is conceptually simple, computationally efficient and allows an agent
to encode prior knowledge in a natural way. We establish an $\tilde{O}(\tau S
\sqrt{AT})$ bound on the expected regret, where $T$ is time, $\tau$ is the
episode length and $S$ and $A$ are the cardinalities of the state and action
spaces. This bound is one of the first for an algorithm not based on optimism,
and close to the state of the art for any reinforcement learning algorithm. We
show through simulation that PSRL significantly outperforms existing algorithms
with similar regret bounds.

many Galactic center molecular clouds. In M-0.02-0.07, we find that the hot
ammonia, contributes ~10% of the cloud's total ammonia column density, and
further, that the hot ammonia in this cloud arises in gas which is extended or
uniformly distributed on ~10 arcsecond scales. We discuss the implications of
these constraints upon the nature of this hot gas component. In addition to the

early chemodynamical evolution. In our previous paper, we obtained abundances
of alpha elements by performing a one-dimensional LTE abundance analysis based
on the high-resolution (R~50000) spectra obtained with the Subaru/HDS. In this
paper, a similar analysis is performed to determine abundances of an additional
17 elements. We show that, in metallicities below [Fe/H]~-2, the abundance
ratios of many elements in the thick disk, inner halo, and outer halo
subsamples are largely similar. In contrast, in higher metallicities
([Fe/H]>-1.5), differences in some of the abundance ratios among the three
subsamples are identified. Specifically, the [Na/Fe], [Ni/Fe], [Cu/Fe], and
[Zn/Fe] ratios in the inner and outer halo subsamples are found to be lower
than those in the thick disk subsample. In contrast to what was observed for
[Mg/Fe] in our previous paper, [Eu/Fe] ratios are more enhanced in the two halo
subsamples rather than in the thick disk subsample. The observed distinct
chemical abundances of some elements between the thick disk and inner/outer
halo subsamples with [Fe/H]>-1.5 support the hypothesis that these components
formed through different mechanisms. In particular, our results favor the
scenario that the inner and outer halo components formed through an assembly of
multiple progenitor systems that experienced various degrees of chemical
enrichments, while the thick disk formed through rapid star formation with an
efficient mixing of chemical elements.

planetesimal belts. The star Fomalhaut harbors a cold debris belt at 140 AU as
well as evidence of a warm dust component, which is suspected of being a bright
analog to the solar system's zodiacal dust.
  Interferometric observations obtained with the VLTI and the KIN have
identified near- and mid-infrared excesses attributed to hot and warm
exozodiacal dust in the inner few AU of the star.
  We performed parametric modeling of the exozodiacal disk using the GRaTeR
radiative transfer code to reproduce the interferometric data, complemented by
mid- to far-infrared measurements. A detailed treatment of sublimation
temperatures was introduced to explore the hot population at the sublimation
rim. We then used an analytical approach to successively testing several source
mechanisms.
  A good fit to the data is found by two distinct dust populations: (1) very
small, hence unbound, hot dust grains confined in a narrow region at the
sublimation rim of carbonaceous material; (2) bound grains at 2 AU that are
protected from sublimation and have a higher mass despite their fainter flux
level. We propose that the hot dust is produced by the release of small carbon
grains following the disruption of aggregates that originate from the warm
component. A mechanism, such as gas braking, is required to further confine the
small grains for a long enough time. In situ dust production could hardly be
ensured for the age of the star, so the observed amount of dust must be
triggered by intense dynamical activity.
  Fomalhaut may be representative of exozodis that are currently being surveyed
worldwide. We propose a framework for reconciling the hot exozodi phenomenon
with theoretical constraints: the hot component of Fomalhaut is likely the tip
of the iceberg since it could originate from a warm counterpart residing near
the ice line.

reduce them to the finite fields. The mapping whose time evolutions commute
with the reduction is said to have a `good reduction'. We generalize good
reduction in order to be applied to integrable mappings. The generalized good

transfer (SWIPT) has recently drawn significant attention. To meet the
practical requirement that energy receivers (ERs) operate with much higher
received power than information receivers (IRs), ERs need to be deployed closer
to the transmitter than IRs. However, due to the broadcast nature of wireless
channels, one critical issue is that the messages sent to IRs cannot be
eavesdropped by ERs, which possess better channels from the transmitter. In
this paper, we address this new secrecy communication problem in a multiuser
multiple-input single-output (MISO) SWIPT system where a multi-antenna
transmitter sends information and energy simultaneously to one IR and multiple
ERs, each with a single antenna. By optimizing transmit beamforming vectors and
their power allocation, we maximize the weighted sum-energy transferred to ERs
subject to a secrecy rate constraint for the information sent to the IR. We
solve this non-convex problem optimally by reformulating it into a two-stage
problem. First, we fix the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at
the IR and obtain the optimal beamforming solution by applying the technique of
semidefinite relaxation (SDR). Then the original problem is solved by a
one-dimension search over the optimal SINR value for the IR. Furthermore, two
suboptimal low-complexity beamforming schemes are proposed, and their
achievable (secrecy) rate-energy (R-E) regions are compared against that by the
optimal scheme.

non-overlapping camera networks is the correct labeling of tracked objects on
each camera in a consistent way,in the sense that the captured tracklets, or
observations in this paper, of the same object at different cameras should be
assigned with the same label. In this paper, we formulate this task as a
Bayesian inference problem and propose a distributed inference framework in
which the posterior distribution of labeling variable corresponding to each
observation, conditioned on all history appearance and spatio-temporal evidence
made in the whole networks, is calculated based solely on local information
processing on each camera and mutual information exchanging between neighboring
cameras. In our framework, the number of objects presenting in the monitored
region, i.e. the sampling space of labeling variables, does not need to be
specified beforehand. Instead, it can be determined automatically on the fly.
In addition, we make no assumption about the appearance distribution of a
single object, but use similarity scores between appearance pairs, given by
advanced object re-identification algorithm, as appearance likelihood for
inference. This feature makes our method very flexible and competitive when
observing condition undergoes large changes across camera views. To cope with
the problem of missing detection, which is critical for distributed inference,
we consider an enlarged neighborhood of each camera during inference and use a
mixture model to describe the higher order spatio-temporal constraints. The
robustness of the algorithm against missing detection is improved at the cost
of slightly increased computation and communication burden at each camera node.
Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on
an indoor Office Building dataset and an outdoor Campus Garden dataset.

epoch of radial migration that was very rapid, with an e-folding timescale
shorter than 1~Myr. It is probable that the cause of this migration was that
the giant planets experienced an orbital instability that caused them to
encounter each other, resulting in radial migration. Several works suggest that
this dynamical instability occurred `late', long after all the planets had
formed and the solar nebula had dissipated. Assuming that the terrestrial
planets had already formed, then their orbits would have been affected by the
migration of the giant planets. As a result, how did the orbits of the
terrestrial planets change? And can we use this migration to obtain information
on the primordial orbits of the terrestrial planets? We directly model a large
number of terrestrial planet systems and their response to giant planet
migration. We study the change in the Angular Momentum Deficit (AMD) of the
terrstrials. We conclude that the primordial AMD should have been lower than
~70\% of the current value, but higher than 10\%. We find that a scenario with
five giant planets better satisfies the orbital constraints of the terrestrial
planets. We predict that Mars was initially on an eccentric and inclined orbit
while the orbits of Mercury, Venus and Earth were more circular and coplanar.
The lower primordial dynamical excitement and the peculiar partitioning between
planets impose new constraints for terrestrial planet formation simulations.

absolute value of their standard inner products takes on only a small number of
values.
  We begin with bounds: what is the maximal size of a set of lines with only a
given set of angles? We rederive a series of upper bounds originally due to
Delsarte, Goethals and Seidel, but in a novel way using only zonal polynomials
and linear algebra. In the process we get some new results about complex
$t$-designs and also some new characterizations of tightness.
  Next we consider constructions. We describe some generic constructions using
linear codes and Cayley graphs, and then move to two specific instances of the
problem: mutually unbiased bases and equiangular lines. Both cases are
motivated by problems in quantum computing, although they have applications in
digital communications as well.
  Mutually unbiased bases are collections of orthonormal bases with a constant
angle between vectors from different bases. We construct some maximal sets in
prime-power dimensions, originally due to Calderbank, Cameron, Kantor and
Seidel, but again in a novel way using relative difference sets or
distance-regular antipodal covers. We also detail their numerous relations to
other combinatorial objects, including symplectic spreads, orthogonal
decompositions of Lie algebras, and spin models. Peripherally, we discuss
mutually unbiased bases in small dimensions that are not prime powers and in
real vector spaces.
  Equiangular lines are collections of vectors with only one angle between
them. We use difference sets from finite geometry to construct equiangular
lines: these sets do not have maximal size, but they are maximal with respect
to having all entries of the same absolute value. We also include some negative
results about constructions of maximal sets in large dimensions.

assumption of constant volatility in stocks. In spite of evidence that this
parameter is not constant, this formula is widely used by financial markets.
This paper addresses the question of whether an alternative model for stock
price exists for which the Black-Scholes or similar formulae hold. The results
obtained in this paper are very general as no assumptions are made on the
dynamics of the model, whether it be the underlying price process, the
volatility process or how they relate to each other. We show that if the
formula holds for a continuum of strikes and three terminal times, then the
volatility must be constant. However, when it only holds for finitely many
strikes, and three or more maturity times, we obtain a universal bound on the
variation of the volatility. This bound yields that the implied volatility is
constant when the sequence of strikes increases to cover the entire half-line.
This recovers the result for a continuum of strikes by a different approach.

changing different parameters in the coupled harmonic oscillators. We also show
that more general interactions coming from general singular Toeplitz matrices

whole, there is evidence for a weak correlation between the atomic line

so many gas-rich galaxies (likely to be damped Lyman-alpha absorption systems)

have far reaching implications for the population of faint galaxies not

neutron star physics is ideally suited to complement the studies of

at high temperature and relatively small net baryon density.
  In general, in order to pin down or at least constrain the properties of
dense matter, accurate measurements of neutron star properties like masses,
radii, rotational frequency, and cooling behavior are needed. Here, in
relatively recent times the reliable mass determination of the pulsar PSR

dominated by compact AGNs constituting 77% of the total sources in the AT20G.
We introduce the visibility-spectra diagnostic plot, produced using the AT20G
cross-matches with lower frequency radio surveys at 1 GHz (the NRAO-VLA Sky

separates the 20 GHz population into distinct sub-populations of the compact
AGNs, the compact steep-spectrum sources, the extended AGN-powered sources and
extended flat-spectrum sources. The extended flat-spectrum sources include a
local thermal emitting population of high latitude planetary nebulae and also
gravitational lens and binary black hole candidates among the AGNs. We find a
smooth transition in properties between the compact CSS sources and the AGN
populations.
  The visibility catalogue, together with the main AT20G survey, provides an
estimate of angular size scales for sources in the AT20G and an estimate of the

24712 was observed with the HARPSpol instrument at the 3.6-m ESO telescope over
a period of 2010-2011. The resulting spectra have S/N ratio of 300-600 and
resolving power exceeding 100000. The multiline technique of least-squares
deconvolution (LSD) was applied to combine information from the spectral lines
of Fe-peak and rare-earth elements. We used the HARPSPol spectra of HD 24712 to
study the morphology of the Stokes profile shapes in individual spectral lines
and in LSD Stokes profiles corresponding to different line masks. From the LSD
Stokes V profiles we measured the longitudinal component of the magnetic field,
<Bz>, with an accuracy of 5-10 G. We also determined the net linear
polarization from the LSD Stokes Q and U profiles. We determined an improved
rotational period of the star, P_rot = 12.45812 +/- 0.00019d. We measured <Bz>
from the cores of Halpha and Hbeta lines. The analysis of <Bz> measurements
showed no evidence for a significant radial magnetic field gradient in the
atmosphere of HD 24712. We used our <Bz> and net linear polarization
measurements to determine parameters of the dipolar magnetic field topology. We
found that magnetic observables can be reasonably well reproduced by the
dipolar model. We discovered rotational modulation of the Halpha core and
related it a non-uniform surface distribution of rare-earth elements.

originate from an interaction-generated effective spin-orbit coupling that
opens a gap in the band structure. For the unstrained system, there is a
quadratic band touching at the $\Gamma$ point at the Fermi energy for
unpolarized electrons and Dirac points at K, K$'$ at the Fermi energy for fully
polarized electrons. Using density functional theory we show that the quadratic
band touching and Dirac points are remarkably stable to internal strain-induced
out-of-plane distortions and rotations of the oxygen octahedra, which we
compute. The lack of a gap opening from internal strain implies a robustness to
the mean-field predicted topological phases for both the polarized and
unpolarized systems. We also consider an external strain imposed along the
[001] cubic direction and show this can open a gap at the $\Gamma$ point but
leaves the Dirac points intact. Finally, we compute a phase diagram for
parameters relevant to LaNiO$_3$ which shows that strain favors a phase with
polarized orbitals and antiferromagnetic spin order, but leaves earlier
predictions for a zero-magnetic field topological quantum Hall state
essentially unchanged. Taken together, our results suggest that the [111]

the discussion is devoted to the analysis of several procedures that can be
employed to constrain the parameters of a phenomenological pairing interaction.
The parameters are first adjusted to reproduce the experimental gaps evaluated
with the five-point formula. This choice has however some consequences on the
evolution of the pairing correlations along the isotopic chains and, in
particular, at shell closures. Other procedures are then followed (adjustment
on a theoretical pairing gap at mid-shell and on the two-neutron separation
energies).
  For the transfer probabilities, we discuss the effects associated to
different choices of the spatial localization of the pairing interaction. We
indicate that the analysis of pair-transfer reactions for such cases (where the
last bound state is a low-$l$ state in a weakly bound nucleus) may improve our
understanding of two aspects: the spatial distribution of pairing correlations

perturbation induced by the planetary caustic for various microlensing
parameters, especially for the size of the source stars. By constructing the
fractional deviation maps at various positions in the space of microlensing
parameters, we find that the pattern of the fractional deviation depends on the
ratio of the source radius to the caustic size, and the ratio satisfying the
observational threshold varies with the star-planet separation. We have also
obtained the upper limits of the source size that allows the detection of the
signature of the host star as a function of the separation for given
observational threshold. It is shown that this relation further leads one to a
simple analytic condition for the star-planet separation to detect the
boundness of wide-separation planets as a function of the mass ratio and the
source radius. For example, when 5% of the detection threshold is assumed, for
a source star with the radius of ~1 R_sun, an Earth-mass planet and a
Jupiter-mass planet can be recognized of its boundness when it is within the
separation range of ~10 AU and ~30 AU, respectively. We also compare the
separation ranges of detection by the planetary caustic with those by the
central caustic. It is found that when the microlensing light curve caused by
the planetary caustic happens to be analyzed, one may afford to support the
boundness of the wide-separation planet farther than when that caused by the

of the instrument. We show how observing strategies can be optimized to yield
the best detection performance on a specific target. In our current knowledge
of exoplanetary systems, alpha Centauri B b is the most promising target with
less than twenty-five Earth-masses for ZIMPOL. With a gaseous
Rayleigh-scattering atmosphere and favorable inclinations, the planet could be
detected in about four hours of observing time, using the four-quadrant
phase-mask coronograph in the I band. However, if alpha Centauri B b should
display unfavorable polarimetric and reflective properties similar to that of
our Moon, it is around 50 times fainter than the best sensitivity of ZIMPOL.
Alpha Centauri B is a primary target for SPHERE. Dedicated deep observations
specifically targeting the radial velocity-detected planet can lead to a
detection if the polarimetric properties of the planet are favorable.

black-hole (apparent) horizons applicable in dynamical or stationary regimes.
It is found that rotation manifests in the widening of their central regions
(rotational thickening), limits their global shapes to the extent that stable
holes of a given area A and angular momentum J (non zero) form a precompact
family (rotational stabilization) and enforces their whole geometry to be close
to the extreme-Kerr horizon geometry at almost maximal rotational speed
(enforced shaping). The results, which are based on the stability inequality,
depend only on A and J. In particular they are entirely independent of the
surrounding geometry of the space-time and of the presence of matter satisfying
the strong energy condition. A complete set of relations between A, J, the
length L of the meridians and the length R of the greatest axisymmetric circle,
is given. We also provide concrete estimations for the distance between the
geometry of horizons and that of the extreme Kerr, in terms only of A and J.
Besides it own interest, the work has applications to the Hoop conjecture as
formulated by Gibbons in terms of the Birkhoff invariant, to the Bekenstein-Hod
entropy bounds and to study the compactness of classes of stationary black-hole
space-times.

Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) states, previously indicated in the
quasi two-dimensional d-wave superconductors CeCoIn_5 with strong paramagnetic
pair breaking (PPB) in a magnetic-field parallel to the basal plane, are
considered in the field configurations tilted from the basal plane within an
approach assuming that the wavelength of the FFLO modulation is relatively
long. It is demonstrated that, with increasing the tilt angle, both the AFM and
FFLO orders are gradually suppressed, and that disappearance of the AFM order
in zero temperature limit occurs at a lower angle than that of the FFLO state.
Consequently, a nonmagnetic FFLO-ordered high field SC phase is realized in an
intermediate range of the tilt angle even at low enough temperatures. As the
perpendicular field configuration (${\bf H} \parallel c$) is approached by the
field-tilt, the AFM order in real space is found close to the FFLO nodal planes
in contrast to the high field behavior in ${\bf H} \perp c$ case. Further, in
the field v.s. temperature (H-T) phase diagram, the AFM order reduces, at a
higher angle, to an AFM quantum critical point (QCP) lying at a lower field
than H_{c2}(0) as a consequence of competition between the field dependences of
the nesting condition and of PPB. These features of the AFM order and the

the source can be proposed. Furthermore, the effects of pile-up in the

specifically taking into account pile-up effects. With the help of the data of
these two satellites, we performed a detailed spectral study in an energy range

features that we were able to model with a reflection model, whereas the
continuum was modeled with a combination of a thermal component and a
Comptonization part. The analysis of the XMM-Newton data gave evidence for a
broad but not asymmetric iron line. We found no broadening or asymmetry of the

reveal strong backscattering and electron-hole asymmetry depending on the edge

wave function is poorly matched to the propagating states of the pristine

inversely with the ribbon width, similarly to what has been observed in
experiments. We predict the largest transport gap to occur for armchair edges
with Stone-Wales defects, while heptagon and pentagon defects cause about equal
backscattering for electrons and holes, respectively. Choosing the heptagon
defect as an example, we show that although electron interactions in the

the defects and thus to enhance the conductance.

the tearing instability rapidly disrupts the initial current sheet generating
several small-scale plasmoids, that rapidly grow in size coalescing and
kinking. The plasmoid kink is mainly driven by the coalescence process. It is
found that the presence of guide field strongly influences the evolution of the
plasmoid chain. Without a guide field, a main reconnection site dominates and
smaller reconnection regions are included in larger ones, leading to an
hierarchical structure of the plasmoid-dominated current sheet. On the contrary
in presence of a guide field, plasmoids have approximately the same size and
the hierarchical structure does not emerge, a strong core magnetic field
develops in the center of the plasmoid in the direction of the existing guide
field, and bump-on-tail instability, leading to the formation of electron
holes, is detected in proximity of the plasmoids.

observed and have led to the new analytic technique of solar
magneto-seismology, where inferences of the background conditions of the plasma
can be deduced by studying magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) waves. Here, we
generalise a novel magneto-seismological method designed to infer the density
distribution of a bounded plasma structure from the relationship of its
fundamental and first harmonics. Observations of the solar atmosphere have
emphatically shown that stratification, leading to complex density profiles
within plasma structures, is common thereby rendering this work instantly
accessible to solar physics. We show, in a dynamic waveguide, how the period
ratio differs from the idealised harmonic ratios prevalent in homogeneous
structures. These ratios show strong agreement with recent observational work.
Next, anti-node shifts are also analysed. Using typical scaling parameters for
bulk flows within atmospheric waveguides, e.g., coronal loops, it is found that
significant anti-node shifts can be predicted, even to the order of 10 Mm. It
would be highly encouraged to design specific observations to confirm the
predicted anti-node shifts and apply the developed theory of solar
magneto-seismology to gain more accurate waveguide diagnostics of the solar

the problem to one of simultaneous inference and hence suitably widening
conventional confidence and retention intervals. Simultaneity is required for
all linear functions that arise as coefficient estimates in all submodels. By
purchasing ``simultaneity insurance'' for all possible submodels, the resulting
post-selection inference is rendered universally valid under all possible model
selection procedures. This inference is therefore generally conservative for
particular selection procedures, but it is always less conservative than full
Scheffe protection. Importantly it does not depend on the truth of the selected

particle accelerator via a heavy material spallation target. The on-line
reactivity monitoring of such an ADS is a serious issue regarding its safety.
In order to study the methodology of this monitoring, zero-power
experimentswere undertaken at the GUINEVERE facility within the framework of
the FP6-IP-EUROTRANS programme. Such experiments have been under completion
within the FREYA FP7 project. The GUINEVERE facility is hosted at the SCK-CEN
site in Mol (Belgium). It couples the VENUS-F subcritical fast core with the
GENEPI-3C accelerator. The latter delivers a beam of deuterons, which are
converted into 14-MeV neutrons via fusion reactions on a tritiated target. This
paper presents one of the investigated methods for ADS on-line reactivity
monitoring which has to be validated in the program of the FREYA project. It
describes the results obtained when Pulsed Neutron Source experiments are
analysed using the so called Area Method, in order to estimate the reactivity
of a few sub-critical configurations of the VENUS-F reactor, around keff= 0.96.
First the GUINEVERE facility is described. Then, following general
considerations on the Area method, the results of its application to the
neutron population time decrease spectra measured after a pulse by several
fission chambers spread out over the whole reactor are discussed. Finally the
reactivity values extracted are compared to the static reactivity values
obtained using the Modified Source Multiplication (MSM) method.

can be used directly to provide private access to data, with no modification.
The answer is affirmative: under certain conditions on the prior, sampling from
the posterior distribution can be used to achieve a desired level of privacy
and utility. To do so, we generalise differential privacy to arbitrary dataset
metrics, outcome spaces and distribution families. This allows us to also deal
with non-i.i.d or non-tabular datasets. We prove bounds on the sensitivity of
the posterior to the data, which gives a measure of robustness. We also show
how to use posterior sampling to provide differentially private responses to
queries, within a decision-theoretic framework. Finally, we provide bounds on
the utility and on the distinguishability of datasets. The latter are
complemented by a novel use of Le Cam's method to obtain lower bounds. All our
general results hold for arbitrary database metrics, including those for the
common definition of differential privacy. For specific choices of the metric,
we give a number of examples satisfying our assumptions.

higher-order pushdown automata (\HOPS) to a unary stack alphabet, or as an
extension of counter automata to higher levels. We distinguish two principal
kinds of \HOCS: those that can test whether the topmost counter value is zero
and those which cannot.
  We show that control-state reachability for level $k$ \HOCS with $0$-test is
complete for \mbox{$(k-2)$}-fold exponential space; leaving out the $0$-test
leads to completeness for \mbox{$(k-2)$}-fold exponential time. Restricting
\HOCS (without $0$-test) to level $2$, we prove that global (forward or
backward) reachability analysis is $\PTIME$-complete. This enhances the known
result for pushdown systems which are subsumed by level $2$ \HOCS without
$0$-test.
  We transfer our results to the formal language setting. Assuming that $\PTIME
\subsetneq \PSPACE \subsetneq \mathbf{EXPTIME}$, we apply proof ideas of
Engelfriet and conclude that the hierarchies of languages of \HOPS and of \HOCS
form strictly interleaving hierarchies. Interestingly, Engelfriet's
constructions also allow to conclude immediately that the hierarchy of
collapsible pushdown languages is strict level-by-level due to the existing
complexity results for reachability on collapsible pushdown graphs. This
answers an open question independently asked by Parys and by Kobayashi.

wireless networks in a fully distributed fashion, has recently gained a lot of
attentions since it has been proved that appropriate control of CSMA parameters
guarantees optimality in terms of stability (i.e., scheduling) and system- wide
utility (i.e., scheduling and congestion control). Most CSMA-based algorithms
rely on the popular MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) technique, which enables
one to find optimal CSMA parameters through iterative loops of
`simulation-and-update'. However, such a simulation-based approach often
becomes a major cause of exponentially slow convergence, being poorly adaptive
to flow/topology changes. In this paper, we develop distributed iterative
algorithms which produce approximate solutions with convergence in polynomial
time for both stability and utility maximization problems. In particular, for
the stability problem, the proposed distributed algorithm requires, somewhat
surprisingly, only one iteration among links. Our approach is motivated by the
Bethe approximation (introduced by Yedidia, Freeman and Weiss in 2005) allowing
us to express approximate solutions via a certain non-linear system with
polynomial size. Our polynomial convergence guarantee comes from directly
solving the non-linear system in a distributed manner, rather than multiple
simulation-and-update loops in existing algorithms. We provide numerical
results to show that the algorithm produces highly accurate solutions and
converges much faster than the prior ones.

For low energies, the equilibrium flow consists of a purely swirling flow whose
toroidal profile depends on the radial coordinate only. For high energies, the
typical toroidal field is uniform, while the typical poloidal field is
organized into either a single vertical jet or a large scale dipole, and
exhibits infinite fluctuations. This unusual phase diagram comes from the
poloidal fluctuations not being bounded for the axi-symmetric Euler dynamics,
even though the latter conserve infinitely many ''Casimir invariants''. This
shows that 3D axially symmetric flows can be considered as intermediate between

terms, it provides accurate segmentations of medical images in a fully
automated manner. However, one of the main drawbacks of using the RW algorithm
is that its parameters have to be hand-tuned. we propose a novel discriminative
learning framework that estimates the parameters using a training dataset. The
main challenge we face is that the training samples are not fully supervised.
Speci cally, they provide a hard segmentation of the images, instead of a
proba-bilistic segmentation. We overcome this challenge by treating the optimal
probabilistic segmentation that is compatible with the given hard segmentation
as a latent variable. This allows us to employ the latent support vector
machine formulation for parameter estimation. We show that our approach signi
cantly outperforms the baseline methods on a challenging dataset consisting of
real clinical 3D MRI volumes of skeletal muscles.

transport in accretion disks. We present global, three dimensional (3D), MHD
accretion disk simulations that investigate the dependence of the turbulent
stresses on resolution. Convergence in the time-and-volume-averaged
stress-to-gas-pressure ratio, at a value of $\sim0.04$, is found for a model
with radial, vertical, and azimuthal resolution of 12-51, 27, and 12.5 cells
per scale-height (the simulation mesh is such that cells per scale-height
varies in the radial direction). A control volume analysis is performed on the
main body of the disk (|z|<2H) to examine the production and removal of
magnetic energy. Maxwell stresses in combination with the mean disk rotation
are mainly responsible for magnetic energy production, whereas turbulent
dissipation (facilitated by numerical resistivity) predominantly removes
magnetic energy from the disk. Re-casting the magnetic energy equation in terms
of the power injected by Maxwell stresses on the boundaries of, and by Lorentz
forces within, the control volume highlights the importance of the boundary
conditions (of the control volume). The different convergence properties of
shearing-box and global accretion disk simulations can be readily understood on
the basis of choice of boundary conditions and the magnetic field
configuration. Periodic boundary conditions restrict the establishment of
large-scale gradients in the magnetic field, limiting the power that can be
delivered to the disk by Lorentz forces and by stresses at the surfaces. The
factor of three lower resolution required for convergence in turbulent stresses
for our global disk models compared to stratified shearing-boxes is explained
by this finding. (Abridged)

nucleus (AGN) usually relies on the assumption that the broad line region (BLR)
is virialized. However, this assumption seems invalid in BLR models that
consists of an accretion disk and its wind. The disk is likely Keplerian and
therefore virialized. However, the wind material must, beyond a certain point,
be dominated by an outward force that is stronger than gravity. Here, we
analyze hydrodynamic simulations of four different disk winds: an isothermal
wind, a thermal wind from an X-ray heated disk, and two line-driven winds, one
with and the other without X-ray heating and cooling. For each model, we check
whether gravity governs the flow properties, by computing and analyzing the
volume-integrated quantities that appear in the virial theorem: internal,
kinetic, and gravitational energies, We find that in the first two models, the
winds are non-virialized whereas the two line-driven disk winds are virialized
up to a relatively large distance. The line-driven winds are virialized because
they accelerate slowly so that the rotational velocity is dominant and the wind
base is very dense. For the two virialized winds, the so-called projected
virial factor scales with inclination angle as $1/ \sin^2{i}$. Finally, we
demonstrate that an outflow from a Keplerian disk becomes unvirialized more
slowly when it conserves the gas specific angular momentum -- as in the models
considered here, than when it conserves the angular velocity -- as in the
so-called magneto-centrifugal winds.

alternative to maximum likelihood. The proposed Generative Stochastic Networks
(GSN) framework is based on learning the transition operator of a Markov chain
whose stationary distribution estimates the data distribution. The transition
distribution of the Markov chain is conditional on the previous state,
generally involving a small move, so this conditional distribution has fewer
dominant modes, being unimodal in the limit of small moves. Thus, it is easier
to learn because it is easier to approximate its partition function, more like
learning to perform supervised function approximation, with gradients that can
be obtained by backprop. We provide theorems that generalize recent work on the
probabilistic interpretation of denoising autoencoders and obtain along the way
an interesting justification for dependency networks and generalized
pseudolikelihood, along with a definition of an appropriate joint distribution
and sampling mechanism even when the conditionals are not consistent. GSNs can
be used with missing inputs and can be used to sample subsets of variables
given the rest. We validate these theoretical results with experiments on two
image datasets using an architecture that mimics the Deep Boltzmann Machine
Gibbs sampler but allows training to proceed with simple backprop, without the
need for layerwise pretraining.

its dual are rank-two symmetric tensors (Young symmetry type (1,1)), while in
the case of 11 space-time dimensions relevant to M-theory, the dual graviton is
described by a tensor of (8,1) Young symmetry type. We provide in this paper an
action principle that yields the twisted self-duality conditions as equations
of motion, keeping the graviton and its dual on equal footing. In order to
construct a local, quadratic, variational principle for the twisted linear
self-duality equations, it is necessary to introduce two ""prepotentials"". These

Hamiltonian constraints of the Hamiltonian formulation either of the
Pauli-Fierz action for the graviton or of the Curtright action for its dual,

gauge invariance symmetries, which are exhibited and generalize the gauge
symmetries found in D=4. A variational principle where the basic variables are
the original Pauli-Fierz field and its dual can also be given but contrary to
the prepotential action, the corresponding action is non-local in space --
while remaining local in time. We also analyze in detail the Hamiltonian
structure of the theory and show that the graviton and its dual are canonically

(so-called Be stars) offer the rare opportunity of studying the structure and
dynamics of gaseous disks at high spectral as well as angular resolution. Aims.
This paper explores a newly identified effect in spectro-interferometric phase
that can be used for probing the inner regions of gaseous edge-on disks on a
scale of a few stellar radii. Methods. The origin of this effect (dubbed
central quasi-emission phase signature, CQE-PS) lies in the velocity-dependent
line absorption of photospheric radiation by the circumstellar disk. At high
spectral and marginal interferometric resolution, photocenter displacements
between star and isovelocity regions in the Keplerian disk reveal themselves
through small interferometric phase shifts. To investigate the diagnostic
potential of this effect, a series of models are presented, based on detailed
radiative transfer calculations in a viscous decretion disk. Results. Amplitude
and detailed shape of the CQE-PS depend sensitively on disk density and size
and on the radial distribution of the material with characteristic shapes in
differential phase diagrams. In addition, useful lower limits to the angular
size of the central stars can be derived even when the system is almost
unresolved. Conclusions. The full power of this diagnostic tool can be expected
if it can be applied to observations over a full life-cycle of a disk from
first ejection through final dispersal, over a full cycle of disk oscillations,
or over a full orbital period in a binary system.

and energy-dependent pulsations were detected close to the outburst peak and
during the very first part of its decay phase. During the outburst, the
phase-averaged spectrum of the pulsar was well described by an absorbed power
law with photon index ~0.6, but large variations as a function of phase were
present. The source was also detected by Chandra several times (during 2002,
2003, 2006, and 2010) at a quiescent level of ~1E34 erg/s. In 2012 we performed
an infrared photometric follow-up of the R ~ 15 mag optical counterpart with

though a more evolved companion cannot be ruled out by our data (we can exclude
a luminosity class I and a spectral type later than B2). Finally, we show that
the outburst main parameters (duration and peak luminosity) can be accounted
for by interpreting the source transient activity as a type I outburst in a Be

theories with $1/2$ partial breaking of global supersymmetry within the
nonlinear realization (coset) approach. In contrast with the standard
superfield approach in which unbroken supersymmetry plays the leading role, we
have shifted the attention to the spontaneously broken supersymmetry. It turns
out that in the theories in which half of supersymmetries is spontaneously
broken, all physical fermions are just the fermions of the nonlinear
realization. Moreover, the transformation properties of these fermions with
respect to the broken supersymmetry are the same as in the famous Volkov-Akulov
model. Just this fact completely fixed all possible appearances of the fermions
in the component action: they can enter the action through the determinant of
the vielbein (to compensate the transformation of the volume form) and the
covariant derivatives, only. It is very important that in our parametrization
of the coset the rest of physical components, i.e. all bosonic components,
transform as ``matter fields'' with respect to the broken supersymmetry.
Clearly, in such a situation the component action acquires the form of the
Volkov-Akulov action for these ``matter fields''. The complete form of the
action can be further fixed by two additional requirements: a) to reproduce the
bosonic limit, which is explicitly known in many interesting cases, and b) to
have a proper linearized form, which has to be invariant with respect to the
linearized unbroken supersymmetry. We supply the general consideration by a
detailed example of the component action of $N=1$ supermembrane in $D=4$
constructed within our procedure. In this case we provide the exact proof of
the invariance of the constructed component action with respect to both, broken
and unbroken supersymmetries.

and FIR-detected Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at z ~ 1 located in the COSMOS
field and analyze their ultra-violet (UV) to far-infrared (FIR) properties. The
detection of these LBGs in the FIR indicates that they have a dust content high
enough so that its emission can be directly detected. According to a spectral
energy distribution (SED) fitting with stellar population templates to their
UV-to-near-IR observed photometry, PACS-detected LBGs tend to be bigger, more
massive, dustier, redder in the UV continuum, and UV-brighter than
PACS-undetected LBGs. PACS-detected LBGs at z ~ 1 are mostly disk-like galaxies
and are located over the green-valley and red sequence of the color-magnitude
diagram of galaxies at their redshift. By using their UV and IR emission, we
find that PACS-detected LBGs tend to be less dusty and have slightly higher
total star-formation rates (SFRs) than other PACS-detected UV-selected galaxies
within their same redshift range. As a consequence of the selection effect due
to the depth of the FIR observations employed, all our PACS-detected LBGs are
LIRGs. However, none of them are in the ULIRG regime, where the FIR
observations are complete. The finding of ULIRGs-LBGs at higher redshifts
suggests an evolution of the FIR emission of LBGs with cosmic time. In an
IRX-$\beta$ diagram, PACS-detected LBGs at z ~ 1 tend to be located around the
relation for local starburst similarly to other UV-selected PACS-detected
galaxies at their same redshift. Consequently, the dust-correction factors
obtained with their UV continuum slope allow to determine their total SFR,
unlike at higher redshifts. However, the dust attenuation derived from UV to
NIR SED fitting overestimates the total SFR for most of our PACS-detected LBGs
in age-dependent way: the overestimation factor is higher in younger galaxies.

early-type galaxies are presented. Based primarily on the SINFONI kinematics,
ten black hole masses occupying the high-mass regime of the M_BH-sigma relation
are derived using three-integral Schwarzschild models. The effect of dark
matter inclusion on the black hole mass is explored. The omission of a dark
matter halo in the model results in a higher stellar mass-to-light ratio,
especially when extensive kinematic data are used in the model. However, when
the diameter of the sphere of influence -- computed using the black hole mass
derived without a dark halo -- is at least 10 times the PSF FWHM during the
observations, it is safe to exclude a dark matter component in the dynamical
modeling, i.e. the change in black hole mass is negligible. When the spatial
resolution is marginal, restricting the mass-to-light ratio to the right value
returns the correct M_BH although dark halo is not present in the model.
Compared to the M_BH-sigma and M_BH-L relations of McConnell et al. (2011), the
ten black holes are all more massive than expected from the luminosities and
seven black hole masses are higher than expected from the stellar velocity
dispersions of the host bulges. Using new fitted relations which include the
ten galaxies, we find that the space density of the most massive black holes
(M_BH >~ 10^9 Msun) estimated from the M_BH-L relation is higher than the
estimate based on the M_BH-sigma relation and the latter is higher than model
predictions based on quasar counts, each by about an order of magnitude.

purpose of this paper is to consider a dual product, denoted $\odot$, and the
dual residuation of matrices, in order to solve the following inequality $ A
\otimes X \preceq X \preceq B \odot X$. Sufficient conditions ensuring the
existence of a non-linear projector in the solution set are proposed. The

It plays an important role in solar coronal heating, acceleration of the solar

dominated by Alfven waves. Most turbulence theories have been established using
ideal plasma models, such as incompressible MHD. However, there has been no
experimental evidence to support the use of such models for weakly to
moderately collisional plasmas which are relevant to various space and
astrophysical plasma environments. We present the first experiment to measure
the nonlinear interaction between two counterpropagating Alfven waves, which is

daughter Alfven wave generated nonlinearly by a collision between

the global 360 degree evolution of a self-gravitating planetary ring that is in
orbit about an oblate planet. This freely-available code is called epi_int, and
it is distinct from other such codes in its use of streamlines to calculate the
effects of ring self-gravity. The great advantage of this approach is that the
perturbing forces arise from smooth wires of ring matter rather than discreet
particles, so there is very little gravitational scattering and so only a
modest number of particles are needed to simulate, say, the scalloped edge of a
resonantly confined ring or the propagation of spiral density waves.
  The code is applied to the outer edge of Saturn's B ring, and a comparison of
Cassini measurements of the ring's forced response to simulations of Mimas'
resonant perturbations reveals that the B ring's surface density at its outer
edge is 195+-60 gm/cm^2 which, if the same everywhere across the ring would
mean that the B ring's mass is about 90% of Mimas' mass.
  Cassini observations show that the B ring-edge has several free normal modes,
which are long-lived disturbances of the ring-edge that are not driven by any
known satellite resonances. Although the mechanism that excites or sustains
these normal modes is unknown, we can plant such a disturbance at a simulated
ring's edge, and find that these modes persist without any damping for more
than ~10^5 orbits or ~100 yrs despite the simulated ring's viscosity of 100
cm^2/sec. These simulations also indicate that impulsive disturbances at a ring
can excite long-lived normal modes, which suggests that an impact in the recent
past by perhaps a cloud of cometary debris might have excited these
disturbances which are quite common to many of Saturn's sharp-edged rings.

savings with a minimum level of deviation from equity. The solutions provide a
trade-off between alternative organizational tactics, and the argument is made

relentless interest as a novel paradigm of non-classical correlations beyond

discord is a valuable -- so far largely unexplored -- resource in quantum
information processing. Along this line, quite a striking scheme is
{entanglement activation}. An initial amount of discord between two
disentangled parties of a multipartite system affects the dynamics so as to
establish entanglement across a bipartition, which would not arise otherwise.
To date, such a process was proven to be achievable only dynamically, i.e.,
with no guarantee of a stationary entanglement throughput in the presence of
noise. Here, we discover a {\it discord-activated mechanism yielding
steady-state entanglement} production in a realistic continuous-variable setup.
This comprises two coupled optomechanical cavities, where the optical modes
(OMs) communicate through a fiber. We first use a simplified model to highlight
the creation of steady-state discord between the OMs. We show next that such
discord improves the level of stationary optomechanical entanglement attainable
in the system, making it more robust against temperature and thermal noise.

to be I/O efficient, but they all focus on undirected and/or unweighted graphs,
and they only offer sub-optimal query efficiency.
  To address the deficiency of existing work, this paper presents {\em
Highways-on-Disk (HoD)}, a disk-based index that supports both SSD and SSSP
queries on directed and weighted graphs. The key idea of HoD is to augment the
input graph with a set of auxiliary edges, and exploit them during query
processing to reduce I/O and computation costs. We experimentally evaluate HoD
on both directed and undirected real-world graphs with up to billions of nodes
and edges, and we demonstrate that HoD significantly outperforms alternative
solutions in terms of query efficiency.

noiseless and noisy cases and establishes sharp restricted isometry conditions
for sparse signal and low-rank matrix recovery. The analysis relies on a key
technical tool which represents points in a polytope by convex combinations of
sparse vectors. The technique is elementary while leads to sharp results.
  It is shown that for any given constant $t\ge {4/3}$, in compressed sensing
$\delta_{tk}^A < \sqrt{(t-1)/t}$ guarantees the exact recovery of all $k$
sparse signals in the noiseless case through the constrained $\ell_1$
minimization, and similarly in affine rank minimization
$\delta_{tr}^\mathcal{M}< \sqrt{(t-1)/t}$ ensures the exact reconstruction of
all matrices with rank at most $r$ in the noiseless case via the constrained
nuclear norm minimization. Moreover, for any $\epsilon>0$,
$\delta_{tk}^A<\sqrt{\frac{t-1}{t}}+\epsilon$ is not sufficient to guarantee
the exact recovery of all $k$-sparse signals for large $k$. Similar result also
holds for matrix recovery. In addition, the conditions $\delta_{tk}^A <
\sqrt{(t-1)/t}$ and $\delta_{tr}^\mathcal{M}< \sqrt{(t-1)/t}$ are also shown to
be sufficient respectively for stable recovery of approximately sparse signals
and low-rank matrices in the noisy case.

polymatroid representable over $\mathbb{F}_q.$ An algorithm to construct
networks starting from certain class of discrete polymatroids is provided.
Every representation over $\mathbb{F}_q$ for the discrete polymatroid, results
in a linear fractional solution over $\mathbb{F}_q$ for the constructed
network. Next, we consider the index coding problem and show that a linear
solution to an index coding problem exists if and only if there exists a
representable discrete polymatroid satisfying certain conditions which are
determined by the index coding problem considered. El Rouayheb et. al. showed
that the problem of finding a multi-linear representation for a matroid can be
reduced to finding a \textit{perfect linear index coding solution} for an index
coding problem obtained from that matroid. We generalize the result of El
Rouayheb et. al. by showing that the problem of finding a representation for a

and the inertia reaction force was first pointed out by Haisch, Rueda, and
Puthoff (Phys. Rev. A, 49, 678, 1994), and then by Rueda and Haisch following a
totally different and more satisfactory approach (Found. Phys., 28, 1057, 1998;
Phys. Letters A, 240, 115, 1998; Annalen der Physik, 10 (5), 393, 2001). In the
present paper, the approach taken by Rueda and Haisch will be followed, but the
analysis will be done within a formulation that uses nonrelativistic quantum
electrodynamics with the creation and annihilation operators rather than the
approach of Rueda and Haisch using stochastic electrodynamics. We analyze the
interaction between the zero-point field and an object under hyperbolic motion
(constant proper acceleration), and find that there arises a reaction force
which is proportional in magnitude, and opposite in direction, to the
acceleration. This is suggestive of what we know as inertia. We also point out
that the equivalence principle -- that inertial mass and gravitational mass
have the same values -- follows naturally using this approach. Inertial mass
and gravitational mass are not merely equal, they are the identical thing
viewed from two complementary perspectives (Annalen der Physik, 14 (8), 479,
2005). In the first case an object accelerating through the electromagnetic
zero-point field experiences resistance from the field. In the case of an
object held fixed in a gravitational field, the electromagnetic zero-point
field propagates on curved geodesics, in effect accelerating with respect to
the fixed object, thereby generating weight. Hence, the equivalence principle
does not need to be independently postulated.

controversial not just because of its ambitious claims but also because of its
unconventional mathematical approach. He has adopted the mathematical approach
from his experience at solving the Navier Stokes equations in fluid mechanics
using invariance of an arbitrary function under a group of conformal
transformations. However, this esoteric approach resulted in a sound
mathematical formulation for the modelling philosophy of his theorem which is
that since the fundamental characteristic of the universe is motion and motion
can only be provided by force, then the universe could be viewed as a large
force field. He then represented the conservation of this large force field at
a given space time point in the universe by a set of generic equations from
which he obtained his generic solutions whose specific applications depend on
the initial/boundary conditions and other physical constraint conditions. An
important achievement of the theorem methodology is that modelling with it is
reduced to algebraic operations rather than differential equations for the most
parts in previous methodologies. With this understanding from pedagogically
studying the modelling philosophy and mathematics of the theorem, we have been
able to recover from it simple standard equations such as in the Fermat
principle for geometric optics. This is encouraging and therefore supports the
possibility to recover more results and also to provide new ones, thereby
supporting the theorem as a potential candidate for a grand unification theory.

language of mathematics and logic, we define what we call everlasting

the society are indestructible. The infinite history of an everlasting society
unfolds by following deterministic and probabilistic laws that do their best to
satisfy the free will of all the persons of the society.
  We define three possible kinds of histories for everlasting societies:
primitive histories, good histories, and golden histories. In primitive
histories, persons are inherently selfish, and they use their free will to
obtain the personal ownerships of all the goods of the society. In good
histories, persons are inherently good, and they use their free will to
distribute the goods of the society. In good histories, a person is not only
able to desire the personal ownership of goods, but is also able to desire that
a good be owned by another person. In golden histories, free will is bound by
the ethic of reciprocity, which states that ""you should wish upon others as you
would like others to wish upon yourself"". In golden societies, the ethic of
reciprocity becomes a law that partially binds free will, and that must be
abided at all times. In other words, the verb ""should"" becomes the verb ""must"".

how an individual device in the network can learn its optimal cooperation
policy online, which it uses to decide whether or not to provide downlink relay

systematically evaluate the learning algorithm in various deployment scenarios.
Our simulation results suggest that devices have the greatest incentive to
cooperate when the network contains (i) many devices with high energy budgets
for relaying, (ii) many highly mobile users (e.g., users in motor vehicles),

achieve over 20% higher throughput on average than with B2D communications
alone, all while selfishly maximizing their own utilities.

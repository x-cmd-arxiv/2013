correlation discovered by Amati et al. (2002) between Epi, the peak energy of
the prompt GRB emission, and Eiso, the energy released by the GRB assuming
isotropic emission. This correlation has been disputed by various authors, and
our aim is to assess whether it is an intrinsic GRB property or the consequence
of selection effects. We constructed a sample of Fermi GRBs with homogeneous
selection criteria, and we studied their distribution in the Epi-Eiso plane.
Our sample is made of 43 GRBs with a redshift and 243 GRBs without a redshift.
We show that GRBs with a redshift follow a broad Epi-Eiso relation, while GRBs
without a redshift show several outliers. We use these samples to discuss the
impact of selection effects associated with GRB detection and with redshift
measurement. We find that the Epi-Eiso relation is partly due to intrinsic GRB
properties and partly due to selection effects. The lower right boundary of the
Epi-Eiso relation stems from a true lack of luminous GRBs with low Epi. In
contrast, the upper left boundary is attributed to selection effects acting
against the detection GRBs with low Eiso and large Epi that appear to have a
lower signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, we demonstrate that GRBs with and
without a redshift follow different distributions in the Epi-Eiso plane. GRBs
with a redshift are concentrated near the lower right boundary of the Epi-Eiso
relation. This suggests that it is easier to measure the redshift of GRBs close
to the lower Epi-Eiso boundary. In this context, we attribute the controversy
about the reality of the Amati relation to the complex nature of this relation
resulting from the combination of a true physical boundary and biases favoring
the detection and the measurement of the redshift of GRBs located close to this
boundary.

inferred from single crystal diffraction data, collected using both polarized
and unpolarized neutrons. In the (hk0) plane the diffuse scattering is most
noticeable around the k = 0 positions and its intensity rapidly increases at
temperatures below 0.7 K. In addition, planes of diffuse scattering at Q = (hk

with the broad peaks of diffuse scattering in the (hk0) plane at
low-temperatures. Correlation lengths associated with the broad peaks are L ~
150 {\AA} in the a-b plane and L ~ 190 {\AA} along c axis, while the

fine dust to a gravel-like structure of varying depths. Understanding the
dynamics of granular materials is, therefore, vital for the interpretation of
the surface geology of these small bodies and is also critical for the design

present the first measurements of transient weakening of granular material
after shear reversal in microgravity as well as a summary of experimental
results recently published in other journals, which may have important
implications for small-body surfaces. Our results suggest that the force
contact network within a granular material may be weaker in microgravity,
although the influence of any change in the contact network is felt by the
granular material over much larger distances. This could mean that small body
surfaces are even more unstable than previously imagined. However, our results
also indicate that the consequences of, e.g., a meteorite impact or a
spacecraft landing, may be very different depending on the impact angle and
location, and depending on the prior history of the small body surface.

transmission over unreliable links with worst case occurrence of errors. In
such a setup, even an omniscient offline scheduling strategy cannot achieve
stability of the packet queue, nor is it able to use up all the available
bandwidth. Hence, an important first step is to identify an appropriate metric
for measuring the efficiency of scheduling strategies in such a setting. To
this end, we propose a relative throughput metric which corresponds to the long
term competitive ratio of the algorithm with respect to the optimal. We then
explore the impact of the error detection mechanism and feedback delay on our
measure. We compare instantaneous error feedback with deferred error feedback,
that requires a faulty packet to be fully received in order to detect the
error. We propose algorithms for worst-case adversarial and stochastic packet
arrival models, and formally analyze their performance. The relative throughput
achieved by these algorithms is shown to be close to optimal by deriving lower
bounds on the relative throughput of the algorithms and almost matching upper
bounds for any algorithm in the considered settings. Our collection of results
demonstrate the potential of using instantaneous feedback to improve the
performance of communication systems in adverse environments.

Observations over the first 4 years showed a rapid drop in flux and temperature
of the neutron star atmosphere, interpreted as cooling of the neutron star
crust which had been heated during the 2.5 year outburst. However, observations
taken approximately 1400 and 2400 days into quiescence were consistent with
each other, suggesting the crust had reached thermal equilibrium with the core.
Here we present a new Chandra observation of MXB 1659-29 taken 11 years into
quiescence and 4 years since the last Chandra observation. This new observation
shows an unexpected factor of ~3 drop in count rate and change in spectral
shape since the last observation, which cannot be explained simply by continued
cooling. Two possible scenarios are that either the neutron star temperature
has remained unchanged and there has been an increase in the column density,
or, alternatively the neutron star temperature has dropped precipitously and
the spectrum is now dominated by a power-law component. The first scenario may
be possible given that MXB 1659-29 is a near edge-on system, and an increase in
column density could be due to build-up of material in, and a thickening of, a
truncated accretion disk during quiescence. But, a large change in disk height
may not be plausible if standard accretion disk theory holds during quiescence.
Alternatively, the disk may be precessing, leading to a higher column density
during this latest observation.

that they have entered a superwind phase in the past 200 - 500 years. The low
18O/17O (~ 0.1 compared to the solar abundance ratio of ~ 5) and 12C/13C (3-30
cf. the solar value of 89) ratios derived from our study support the idea that
these objects have undergone hot-bottom burning and hence that they are massive
M >= 5 solar-mass AGB stars.

required transforming electromagnetic space around the hidden object in such a

obstacle for building a broadband polarization insensitive cloak for large

the requirement for phase preservation as irrelevant for observation in
incoherent natural light with human eyes that are phase and polarization
insensitive. This allows the cloak design to be made in large scale using
commonly available materials and we successfully report cloaking living

exhibits a rich variety of commensurate and incommensurate static phases in
which topological defects can form domain walls, ordered stripes,
superlattices, and disordered patchy regimes as a function of the filling
fraction. When an external drive is applied, these different static phases
generate distinct dynamical responses. At incommensurate fillings the flow
generally occurs in the form of localized pulses or solitons correlated with
the motion of the topological defect structures. We also find dynamic
transitions between different types of moving states that are associated with
changes in the velocity force curves, structural transitions in the topological
defect arrangements, and modifications of the velocity distributions and
particle trajectories. We find that the dynamic transitions between ordered and
disordered flows exhibit hysteresis, while in strongly disordered regimes there
is no hysteresis and the velocity force curves are smooth. When stripe patterns
are present, transport can occur along the stripe direction rather than along
the driving direction. Structural dynamic transitions can also occur within the
pinned regimes when the applied drive causes distortions of the interstitially
pinned particles while the particles trapped at pinning sites remain immobile.

general Bratteli diagrams, and show their relevance to the study of perfect
orderings: those that support Vershik maps; in particular, perfect orderings
with several extremal paths. A perfect ordering comes equipped with a skeleton
and a correspondence, and conversely, given a skeleton and correspondence, we
describe explicitly how to construct perfect orderings, by showing that paths
in the associated directed graphs determine the language of the order. We
describe an explicit algorithmic method to create perfect orderings on Bratteli
diagrams based on the study of certain relations between the entries of the
diagram's incidence matrices and properties of the associated graphs, with the
latter relations characterizing diagrams which support perfect orderings. Also,
we apply the notions of skeletons and associated graphs, to give a new

k maximal paths have a direct sum of k-1 copies of the integers contained in

dense cores that are accreting external gas up to and beyond the point of star
formation. Our model clouds are spherical, unmagnetized configurations with
fixed outer boundaries, across which gas enters subsonically. When we start
with any near-equilibrium state, we find that the cloud's internal velocity
also remains subsonic for an extended period, in agreement with observations.
However, the velocity becomes supersonic shortly before the star forms.
Consequently, the accretion rate building up the protostar is much greater than
the benchmark value c_s^3/G, where c_s is the sound speed in the dense core.
This accretion spike would generate a higher luminosity than those seen in even
the most embedded young stars. Moreover, we find that the region of supersonic
infall surrounding the protostar races out to engulf much of the cloud, again
in violation of the observations, which show infall to be spatially confined.
Similar problematic results have been obtained by all other hydrodynamic
simulations to date, regardless of the specific infall geometry or boundary
conditions adopted. Low-mass star formation is evidently a quasi-static
process, in which cloud gas moves inward subsonically until the birth of the
star itself. We speculate that magnetic tension in the cloud's deep interior
helps restrain the infall prior to this event.

constraint on dark matter in this mass range, and consider how various
uncertainties and assumptions made might alter this conclusion. We also note
that while XENON100's two nuclear recoil candidates each exhibit very low
ratios of ionization-to-scintillation signals, making them difficult to
attribute to known electronic or neutron backgrounds, they are consistent with
originating from dark matter particles in the mass range favored by CoGeNT and
CDMS. We argue that with lower, but not implausible, values for the relative
scintillation efficiency of liquid xenon (L_eff), and the suppression of the
scintillation signal in liquid xenon at XENON100's electric field (S_nr), these
two events could consistently arise from dark matter particles with a mass and
cross section in the range favored by CoGeNT and CDMS. If this interpretation
is correct, we predict that the LUX experiment, with a significantly higher
light yield than XENON100, should observe dark matter induced events at an

that the effect of constant shearing on the granular material, in a direction

  We demonstrate that the new adaptation of the parallel N-body hard-sphere

observed, the scale of the collective motion increases with increasing
small-particle additive concentration.
  We then extend our investigations to assess how self-gravity and external
gravity affect collective motion. In our reduced-gravity simulations both the
gravitational conditions and the frequency of the vibrations roughly match the
conditions on asteroids subjected to seismic shaking, though real regolith is
likely to be much more heterogeneous and less ordered than in our idealised
simulations. We also show that collective motion can occur in a granular

absence of an external gravitational field. These investigations demonstrate
the great interest of being able to simulate conditions that are to relevant

in numerical relativity, as it arises in models of Cauchy surfaces containing

asymptotically Euclidean manifolds have analogues on compact manifolds with

the usually entangled nature of higher molecular-weight polymers leads to
microstructures comprised of molecularly ordered crystallites interconnected by
amorphous regions. Here, we examine the interplay between extended exciton
states delocalized along the polymer backbones and across polymer chains within
the $\pi$-stack, depending on the structural development with molecular weight.
We combine optical spectroscopies, thermal probes, and theoretical modeling,
focusing on neat poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), one of the most extensively
studied polymer semiconductors, of weight-average molecular weight of
3-450\,kg/mol. The spatial coherence within the chain is significantly reduced
(by nearly 30\%). These observations give valuable structural information; they
suggest that the macromolecules in aggregated regions of high-molecular-weight
P3HT adopt a more planar conformation compared to low-molecular-weight
materials. This results in the observed increase in intrachain exciton
coherence. In contrast, shorter chains seem to lead to torsionally more
disordered architectures. A rigorous, fundamental description of primary
photoexcitations in $\pi$-conjugated polymers is hence developed:
two-dimensional excitons are defined by the chain-length dependent molecular
arrangement and interconnectivity of the conjugated macromolecules, leading to

neutrino mass spectrum (with at least one neutrino with mass below $\sim

sources at $z \gtrsim 16$. The neutrino transmission probability shows no more
than two separate suppression dips since the two lightest mass eigenstates
contribute as a single species when thermal effects are included. Results are
applied to a number of models of ultra high energy neutrino emission.
Suppression effects are strong for sources that extend beyond $z \sim 10$,
which can be realized for certain top down scenarios, such as superheavy dark
matter decays, cosmic strings and cosmic necklaces. For these, a broad
suppression valley should affect the neutrino spectrum at least in the energy
interval $10^{12} - 10^{13}$ GeV -- which therefore is disfavored for ultra
high energy neutrino searches -- with only a mild dependence on the neutrino
mass spectrum and hierarchy. The observation of absorption effects would
indicate a population of sources beyond $z \sim 10$, and favor top-down
mechanisms; it would also be an interesting probe of the physics of the relic

decade, deep mysteries continue to haunt our theoretical understanding of the

More than 95 percent of the content of the energy-stress tensor has to be in
the form of inflaton, dark matter and dark energy, which do not have any
non-gravitational or laboratory evidence and remain unidentified. Moreover, the
dark energy poses a serious confrontation between fundamental physics and
cosmology. This makes a strong case to discover alternative theories which do
not require the dark sectors of the standard approach to explain the
observations.
  In the present situation, it would be important to gain insight about the
requirements of the `would be' final theory from all possible means. In this
context, the present paper highlights some, hitherto unnoticed, interesting
coincidences which may prove useful to develop insight about the `holy grail'
of gravitation. It appears that the requirement of the speculative dark sectors
by the energy-stress tensor, is indicative of a possible way out of the present
crisis appearing in the standard cosmology, in terms of a theory wherein the
energy-stress tensor does not play a direct role in the dynamics. It is shown
that various cosmological observations can be explained satisfactorily in the
framework of one such theory $-$ the Milne model, without requiring the dark
sectors of the standard approach. Moreover, the model evades the horizon,
flatness and the cosmological constant problems afflicting the standard
cosmology.
  Though Milne's theory is an incomplete, phenomenological theory, and cannot
be the final theory of gravitation, nevertheless, it would be worthwhile to
study these coincidences, which may help us develop insight about the would-be
final theory.

method aiming at precision recovery of the cosmological power spectrum from
galaxy redshift surveys. Our approach improves over previous Bayesian methods
by performing a joint inference of the three dimensional density field, the
cosmological power spectrum, luminosity dependent galaxy biases and
corresponding normalizations. We account for all joint and correlated
uncertainties between all inferred quantities. Classes of galaxies with
different biases are treated as separate sub samples. The method therefore also
allows the combined analysis of more than one galaxy survey.
  In particular, it solves the problem of inferring the power spectrum from
galaxy surveys with non-trivial survey geometries by exploring the joint
posterior distribution with efficient implementations of multiple block Markov
chain and Hybrid Monte Carlo methods. Our Markov sampler achieves high
statistical efficiency in low signal to noise regimes by using a deterministic
reversible jump algorithm. We test our method on an artificial mock galaxy
survey, emulating characteristic features of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data
release 7, such as its survey geometry and luminosity dependent biases. These
tests demonstrate the numerical feasibility of our large scale Bayesian
inference frame work when the parameter space has millions of dimensions.
  The method reveals and correctly treats the anti-correlation between bias
amplitudes and power spectrum, which are not taken into account in current
approaches to power spectrum estimation, a 20 percent effect across large
ranges in k-space. In addition, the method results in constrained realizations
of density fields obtained without assuming the power spectrum or bias

use the Via Lactea dark matter only cosmological simulations to test two
well-motivated simple hypotheses---transformation of irregulars into dwarf
spheroidal galaxies by tidal stirring and ram pressure stripping following a
close passage to the host galaxy, and transformation via mergers between
dwarfs---and predict the radial distribution and inferred formation times of
the resulting dwarf spheroidal galaxies. We compare this to the observed
distribution in the Local Group and show that 1) the observed dSph distribution
far from the Galaxy or M31 can be matched by the VL halos that have passed near
the host galaxy at least once, though significant halo-to-halo scatter exists,
2) models that require two or more pericenter passages for dSph-formation
cannot account for the dSphs beyond 500 kpc such as Cetus and Tucana, and 3)
mergers predict a flat radial distribution of dSphs and cannot account for the
high dSph fraction near the Galaxy, but are not ruled out at large distances.
The models also suggest that for dSphs found today beyond 500 kpc, mergers tend
to occur significantly earlier than dwarf--host encounters, thus leading to a
potentially observable difference in stellar populations. We argue that tidal
interactions are sufficient to reproduce the observed distribution of dSphs if
and only if a single pericenter passage is sufficient to form a dSph.

active galactic nuclei (AGN) to the mid-IR luminosity and the star formation

makes a minimal contribution (<25%) to the mid-IR luminosity. The 70 micron
selected ULIRGs which we find to be spectroscopic close pairs, are observed to
have high SFE, similar to local ULIRGs and high redshift submillimeter
galaxies, consistent with enhanced IR luminosity due to an ongoing major
merger. Combined with existing observations of local and high redshift ULIRGs,
we further compare the PAH, IR and CO luminosities. We show that the ratio
LPAH6.2/LIR decreases with increasing IR luminosity for both local and high
redshift galaxies but the trend for high redshift galaxies is shifted to higher
IR luminosities; the average LPAH6.2/LIR ratio at a given LIR is ~3 times
higher at high redshift. When we normalize by the molecular gas, we find this
trend to be uniform for galaxies at all redshifts and that the molecular gas is
correlated with the PAH dust emission.The similar trends seen in the [CII] to
molecular gas ratios in other studies suggests that PAH emission, like [CII],
continues to be a good tracer of photodissociation regions even at high

polarization characteristics of the Egg Nebula is influenced by the higher
optical depth of the central regions of the nebula (i.e., the ""dustsphere"" of
about 1000 AU radius), causing the nebula illuminated in two steps -- the
direct starlight is first channeled into bipolar cavities and then scattered
off to the rest of the nebula. We then measured the amount of motion of local
structures and the signature concentric arcs by determining their relative
shifts over the 7.25 yr interval. Based on our analysis, which does not rely on
the single-scattering assumption, we concluded that the lobes have been
excavated by a linear expansion along the bipolar axis for the past 400 yr,
while the concentric arcs have been generated continuously and moving out
radially at about 10 km/s for the past 5,500 yr, and there appears to be a
colatitudinally-increasing trend in the radial expansion velocity field of the
concentric arcs. There exist numerical investigations into the mass-loss
modulation by the central binary system, which predict such a
colatitudinally-increasing expansion velocity field in the spiral-shock trails
of the mass-loss ejecta. Therefore, the Egg Nebula may represent a rare edge-on
case of the binary-modulated circumstellar environs, corroborating the previous
theoretical predictions.

locally linearly dependent (in abbreviated form: LLD) when every vector x of U
is annihilated by a non-zero operator in S. A duality argument bridges the
theory of LLD spaces to the one of vector spaces of non-injective operators.
This new insight yields a unified approach to rediscover basic LLD theorems and
obtain many additional ones thanks to the power of formal matrix computations.
  In this article, we focus on the minimal rank for a non-zero operator in an
LLD space. Among other things, we reprove the Bresar-Semrl theorem, which
states that an n-dimensional LLD operator space always contains a non-zero
operator with rank less than n, and we improve the Meshulam-Semrl theorem that
examines the case when no non-zero operator has rank less than n-1.
  We also tackle the minimal rank problem for a non-zero operator in an
n-dimensional operator space that is not algebraically reflexive. A theorem of
Meshulam and Semrl states that, for all fields with large enough cardinality, a
non-reflexive operator space with dimension n must contain a non-zero operator
with rank at most 2n-2. We show that there are infinitely many integers n for
which this bound is optimal for general infinite fields. Moreover, under mild
cardinality assumptions, we obtain a complete classification of the
non-reflexive n-dimensional operator spaces in which no non-zero operator has
rank less than 2n-2. This classification involves a new algebraic structure
called left-division-bilinearizable (in abbreviated form: LDB) division

several such results. For four candidates, the message is, roughly, that most
scoring rules (with the exception of Borda) do not guarantee the existence of a

the interaction rates will modulate throughout the year due to the orbital
motion of the Earth. Over the course of more than 10 years of operation, DAMA
has indeed detected a strong modulation in the event rate above the detector
threshold of 2 keVee. Under standard assumptions regarding the dark matter halo
and WIMP interactions, this signal is consistent with that expected of WIMPs of
two different approximate masses: ~ 10 GeV and ~ 70 GeV. We examine how a lower
threshold, allowed by recent upgrades to the DAMA detector, may shed light on
this situation. We find that the lower threshold data should rule out one of
the two mass ranges for spin-independent couplings (in the worst case,
disfavoring one of the masses by still more than 2.6$\sigma$) and is likely,
though not certain, to do the same for spin-dependent couplings. Furthermore,
the data may indicate whether the interaction is predominantly spin-independent
or spin-dependent in some cases. Our findings illustrate the importance of a
low threshold in modulation searches.

science, while convex shape constraint gives rise to numerous challenges in
asymptotic performance analysis. This paper is devoted to minimax optimal
estimation of univariate convex functions from the H\""older class in the
framework of shape constrained nonparametric estimation. Particularly, the
paper establishes the optimal rate of convergence in two steps for the minimax
sup-norm risk of convex functions with the H\""older order between one and two.
In the first step, by applying information theoretical results on probability
measure distance, we establish the minimax lower bound under the supreme norm
by constructing a novel family of piecewise quadratic convex functions in the
H\""older class. In the second step, we develop a penalized convex spline
estimator and establish the minimax upper bound under the supreme norm. Due to
the convex shape constraint, the optimality conditions of penalized convex
splines are characterized by nonsmooth complementarity conditions. By
exploiting complementarity methods, a critical uniform Lipschitz property of
optimal spline coefficients in the infinity norm is established. This property,
along with asymptotic estimation techniques, leads to uniform bounds for bias
and stochastic errors on the entire interval of interest. This further yields
the optimal rate of convergence by choosing the suitable number of knots and
penalty value. The present paper provides the first rigorous justification of
the optimal minimax risk for convex estimation under the supreme norm.

for the estimation of a regression function with non-homogeneous smoothness
across the domain. Two challenging issues that arise in this context are the
evaluation of the equivalent kernel and the determination of a local penalty.
The roughness penalty is a function of the design points in order to
accommodate local behavior of the regression function. It is shown that the
spatially adaptive smoothing spline estimator is approximately a kernel
estimator. The resulting equivalent kernel is spatially dependent. The
equivalent kernels for traditional smoothing splines are a special case of this
general solution. With the aid of the Green's function for a two-point boundary
value problem, the explicit forms of the asymptotic mean and variance are
obtained for any interior point. Thus, the optimal roughness penalty function
is obtained by approximately minimizing the asymptotic integrated mean square
error. Simulation results and an application illustrate the performance of the
proposed estimator.

two-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations. Compared with previous
works, in this paper we include the $T_{\theta\phi}$ component of the viscous
stress and consider various values of the viscous parameter $\alpha$. We find
that when $T_{\theta\phi}$ is included, the rotational speed of the
high-latitude flow decreases, while the density increases and decreases at the
high and low latitudes, respectively. We calculate the radial profiles of
inflow and outflow rates. We find that the inflow rate decreases inward,
following a power law form of $\dot{M}_{\rm in}\propto r^s$. The value of $s$
depends on the magnitude of $\alpha$ and is within the range of $\sim 0.4-1.0$.
Correspondingly, the radial profile of density becomes flatter compared with
the case of a constant $\dot{M}(r)$. We find that the density profile can be
described by $\rho(r)\propto r^{-p}$, and the value of $p$ is almost same for a
wide range of $\alpha$ ranging from $\alpha=0.1$ to $0.005$. The inward
decrease of inflow accretion rate is very similar to hot accretion flows, which
is attributed to the mass loss in outflows. To study the origin of outflow, we
analyze the convective stability of slim disk. We find that depending on the
value of $\alpha$, the flow is marginally stable (when $\alpha$ is small) or
unstable (when $\alpha$ is large). This is different from the case of
hydrodynamical hot accretion flow where radiation is dynamically unimportant
and the flow is always convectively unstable. We speculate that the reason for
the difference is because radiation can stabilize convection. The origin of
outflow is thus likely because of the joint function of convection and
radiation, but further investigation is required.

Total Lightning Network (ENTLN) during two cases of severe weather. Data from
the ENTLN serve as a substitute for those from the upcoming launch of the GOES
Lightning Mapper (GLM). We use the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model
and variational data assimilation techniques at 9 km spatial resolution. The
main goal is to examine the potential impact of lightning observations from the
future GLM.
  Previous efforts to assimilate lightning observations mainly utilized nudging
approaches. We develop three more sophisticated approaches, 3D-VAR WRFDA and
1D+nD-VAR (n=3,4) WRFDA schemes that currently are being considered for
operational implementation by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction
(NCEP) and the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). This research uses Convective
Available Potential Energy (CAPE) as a proxy between lightning data and model
variables.
  To test the performance of the aforementioned schemes, we assess the quality
of resulting analysis and forecasts of precipitation compared to those from a
control experiment and verify them against NCEP stage IV precipitation. Results
demonstrate that assimilating lightning observations improves precipitation
statistics during the assimilation window and for 3-7 h thereafter. The
1D+4D-VAR approach performs best, significantly improving precipitation root
mean square errors by 25% and 27.5% compared to the control during the
assimilation window on the two cases. This finding confirms that the
variational nD-VAR (n=3,4) assimilation of lightning observations improves the
accuracy of moisture analyses and forecasts. Finally, we briefly discuss
limitations inherent in the current lightning assimilation schemes, their
implications, and possible ways to improve them.

bright emission with an angular scale similar to the disk observed at
millimeter wavelengths. This distribution is offset toward the blueshifted jet,
indicating the presence of a geometrically thick disk or a remnant envelope,
and therefore the earliest stage of the Class II evolutionary phase. We perform
comparisons between the observed PI distribution and disk models with: (1) full
radiative transfer code, using the spectral energy distribution (SED) to
constrain the disk parameters; and (2) monochromatic simulations of scattered
light which explore a wide range of parameters space to constrain the disk and
dust parameters. We show that these models cannot consistently explain the

associated with an optically thin and geometrically thick layer above the disk
surface, with the surface responsible for the infrared SED. Half of the
scattered light and thermal radiation in this layer illuminates the disk
surface, and this process may significantly affect the thermal structure of the

ferromagnet/normal-conductor interfaces have important consequences for future
magnetic memory technology. In one interpretation, the switching originates
from carriers with spin-dependent scattering giving rise to a relativistic
anti-damping spin-orbit torque (SOT) in structures with broken space-inversion
symmetry. The alternative interpretation combines the relativistic spin Hall
effect (SHE), making the normal-conductor an injector of a spin-current, with
the non-relativistic spin-transfer torque (STT) in the ferromagnet. Remarkably,
the SHE in these experiments originates from the Berry phase effect in the band
structure of a clean crystal and the anti-damping STT is also based on a
disorder-independent transfer of spin from carriers to magnetization. Here we
report the observation of an anti-damping SOT stemming from an analogous Berry
phase effect to the SHE. The SOT alone can therefore induce magnetization
dynamics based on a scattering-independent principle. The ferromagnetic
semiconductor (Ga,Mn)As we use has a broken space-inversion symmetry in the
crystal. This allows us to consider a bare ferromagnetic element which
eliminates by design any SHE related contribution to the spin torque. We
provide an intuitive picture of the Berry phase origin of the anti-damping SOT
and a microscopic modeling of measured data.

performance for filtering images with different types of noise while preserving

filtered by a Boolean function, which characterizes the filter. Adaptive stack
filters can be computed by training using a prototype (ideal) image and its

adaptive stack filters when they are applied to speckled imagery, in particular
to Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. This is done by evaluating the
quality of the filtered images through the use of suitable image quality

available concerning relevant chemical kinetics. However, existing network
inference methods for continuous, steady-state data are typically rooted in
statistical formulations, which do not exploit chemical kinetics to guide
inference. Herein, we present an approach to network inference for steady-state

equilibrium analysis of chemical kinetics to obtain functional forms that are
in turn used to infer networks using steady-state data. The approach we propose
is directly applicable to conventional steady-state gene expression or
proteomic data and does not require knowledge of either network topology or any
kinetic parameters. We illustrate the approach in the context of protein
phosphorylation networks, using data simulated from a recent mechanistic model

known and used for assessment, whereas in the latter, results are compared
against known biochemistry. We find that the proposed methodology is more
effective at estimating network topology than methods based on linear models.

the minimum entropy criterion in the setting of stochastic search, with
application to target localization. Each player yields a noisy response to a
binary query governed by a certain error probability. First, we propose a
sequential policy for constructing questions that queries each player in
sequence and refines the posterior of the target location. Second, we consider
a joint policy that asks all players questions in parallel at each time instant
and characterize the structure of the optimal policy for constructing the
sequence of questions. This generalizes the single player probabilistic
bisection method for stochastic search problems. Third, we prove an equivalence
between the two schemes showing that, despite the fact that the sequential
scheme has access to a more refined filtration, the joint scheme performs just
as well on average. Fourth, we establish convergence rates of the mean-square
error (MSE) and derive error exponents. Lastly, we obtain an extension to the
case of unknown error probabilities. This framework provides a mathematical
model for incorporating a human in the loop for active machine learning
systems.

surface or edge states. Time-reversal symmetry (TRS) protected TIs are
characterized by the Z2 topological invariant and their helical property
becomes lost in an applied magnetic field. Currently there exist extensive
efforts searching for TIs that are protected by symmetries other than TRS. Here
we show, a topological phase characterized by a spin Chern topological
invariant is realized in an inverted electron-hole bilayer engineered from
indium arsenide-gallium antimonide (InAs/GaSb) semiconductors which retains
robust helical edges under a strong magnetic field. Wide conductance plateaus
of 2e2/h value are observed; they persist to 12T applied in-plane magnetic
field without evidence for transition to a trivial insulator. In a
perpendicular magnetic field up to 8T, there exists no signature to the bulk
gap closing. While the Fermi energy remains inside the bulk gap, the
longitudinal conductance increases from 2e2/h in strong magnetic fields
suggesting a trend towards chiral edge transport. Our findings are first
evidences for a quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator protected by a spin Chern
invariant. These results demonstrate that InAs/GaSb bilayers are a novel system
for engineering the robust helical edge channels much needed for spintronics
and for creating and manipulating Majorana particles in solid state.

provide tentative evidence that: i) it is possible to automatically detect when
during the meeting a key decision is taking place, from analyzing only the
local dialogue acts, ii) there are common patterns in the way social dialogue
acts are interspersed throughout a meeting, iii) at the time key decisions are
made, the amount of time left in the meeting can be predicted from the amount
of time that has passed, iv) it is often possible to predict whether a proposal

built a distributed service that manages updates to widely deployed

relatively lightweight and useful for the somewhat reduced information critical
applications. The service is built on our distributed concurrency control
scheme which combines optimism and pessimism in the processing of transactions.
The service allows a transaction to be processed immediately (optimistically)
at any individual replica as long as the transaction satisfies a cost bound.
All transactions are also processed in a concurrent pessimistic manner to
ensure mutual consistency.

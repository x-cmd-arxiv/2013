In particular,
asymptotic behavior of chaotic systems, when their orbits evolve backwards in
time. Reversed dynamics reveals important aspects of the trajectories, such as
a new necessary parameter. This is the strategy through which one orbit reaches
an original state in the past. As a result, it is found that backward orbits
exhibit sensitivity to the strategy. This gives additional evidence about the

of ecological restoration. We assume that cost is proportional to the number of
individuals introduced into a large habitat. We treat dispersal as homogeneous
diffusion. The local population dynamics depends on sex ratio at birth, and
allows mortality rates to differ between sexes. Furthermore, local density
dependence induces a strong Allee effect, implying that the initial population
must be sufficiently large to avert rapid extinction. We address three
different initial spatial distributions for the introduced individuals; for
each we minimize the associated cost, constrained by the requirement that the
species must be restored throughout the habitat. First, we consider spatially
inhomogeneous, unstable stationary solutions of the model's equations as
plausible candidates for small restoration cost. Second, we use numerical
simulations to find the smallest cluster size, enclosing a spatially
homogeneous population density, that minimizes the cost of assured restoration.
Finally, by employing simulated annealing, we minimize restoration cost among
all possible initial spatial distributions of females and males. For biased sex
ratios, or for a significant between-sex difference in mortality, we find that
sex-specific spatial distributions minimize the cost. But as long as the sex
ratio maximizes the local equilibrium density for given mortality rates, a
common homogeneous distribution for both sexes that spans a critical distance
yields a similarly low cost.

along an arbitrary null geodesic in Kerr geometry. The motivation comes from
the problem of an observer trying to communicate quantum information to another
observer in Kerr spacetime by transmitting polarized photons. It is essential
that the observers understand the relationship between their frames of
reference and also know how the photon's polarization transforms as it travels
through Kerr spacetime. Existing methods to calculate the rotation of the
photon polarization (Faraday rotation) depend on choices of coordinate systems,
are algebraically complex and yield results only in the weak-field limit.
  We give a closed-form expression for a parallel propagated frame along an
arbitrary null geodesic using Killing-Yano theory, and thereby solve the
problem of parallel transport of the polarization vector in an intrinsic,
geometrically-motivated fashion. The symmetries of Kerr geometry are utilized
to obtain a remarkably compact expression for the geometrically induced phase
of the photon's polarization. We show that this phase vanishes on the
equatorial plane and the axis of symmetry.

optimal trajectories as training data, but merely needs to iteratively provide

field H in YBa2Cu3O6.45 arises from a competition with superconductivity
because the effect occurs for H perpendicular, but not parallel, to the CuO2
planes, and it persists up to field values comparable to Hc2. We also find that
the spin-freezing has a glassy nature and that the frozen state onsets at a
temperature which is independent of the magnitude of H. These results, together
with the presence of a competing charge-ordering instability at nearby doping
levels, are strikingly parallel to those previously obtained in La-214. This
suggests a universal interpretation of magnetic field effects in underdoped
cuprates where the enhancement of spin order by the field may not be the
primary phenomenon but rather a byproduct of the competition between
superconductivity and charge order. Low-energy spin fluctuations are manifested
up to relatively high temperatures where they partially mask the signature of
the pseudogap in 1/T1 data of planar Cu sites.

the isospin (nucleon asymmetry) dependence of the Hartree-Fock-like potential
relevant for nucleons near the Fermi energy. Data constraints indicate that a
Lane-type potential adequately describes its asymmetry dependence. Correlations
beyond the mean-field can also be described in this framework, but this
requires an extension that treats the non-locality of the Hartree-Fock-like
potential properly. The DOM has therefore been extended to properly describe
ground-state properties of nuclei as a function of nucleon asymmetry in
addition to standard ingredients like elastic nucleon scattering data and level
structure. Predictions of nucleon correlations at larger nucleon asymmetries
can then be made after data at smaller asymmetries constrain the potentials
that represent the nucleon self-energy. A simple extrapolation for Sn isotopes
generates predictions for increasing correlations of minority protons with
increasing neutron number. Such predictions can be investigated by performing
experiments with exotic beams. The predicted neutron properties for the double
closed-shell 132Sn nucleus exhibit similar correlations as those in 208Pb.
Future relevance of these studies for understanding the properties of all
nucleons, including those with high momentum, and the role of three-body forces
in nuclei are briefly discussed. Such an implementation will require a proper
treatment of the non-locality of the imaginary part of the potentials and a
description of high-momentum nucleons as experimentally constrained by the

amorphous phase above 18 GPa. Unlike previous reports on other clathrate
compounds, no volume-collapse is observed prior to the crystalline-amorphous
phase transition which takes place when the unit cell volume is reduced to 81%
of its ambient pressure value. Fits of the pressure-dependent relative volume
to a Murnaghan equation of state (EOS) yield a bulk modulus B0 = 65+-3 GPa and
a pressure derivative B'0 = 3.3+-0.5. The Eu L2-edge XMCD data shows quenching
of the magnetic order at the crystalline-amorphous phase transition. The XANES
spectra indicate the persistence of Eu2+ valency state up to 22 GPa, therefore
the suppression of XMCD intensity is due to the loss of magnetic order as a
result of frustrated exchange interactions in the amorphous phase, and not due
to quenching of local moments. When compared with other clathrates, the results
point to the importance of guest ion-cage interactions in determining the
mechanical stability of the framework structure and the critical pressure for
amorphization. Finally, the crystalline structure is not found to recover after
pressure release, resulting in a novel amorphous material that is at least
metastable at ambient pressure and temperature.

rapidly rotating ultracool dwarfs with spectral types ranging from M7 through
T2 and projected rotational velocities vsini >= 30 km s^{-1}. All these dwarfs
are believed to have dusty atmospheres and oblate shapes, an appropriate
scenario to produce measurable linear polarization of the continuum light.\\
Methods. Linear polarimetric images were collected in the J-band for a sample
of 18 fast-rotating ultracool dwarfs, five of which were also observed in the
Z-band using the LIRIS spectrograph on the Cassegrain focus of the 4.2-m
William Herschel Telescope. The measured median uncertainty in the linear
polarization degree is +/-0.13% for our sample, which allowed us to detect
polarization signatures above ~0.39% with a confidence of >=3\sigma.\\ Results.
About 40+/-15% of the sample is linearly polarized in the Z- and J-bands. All
positive detections have linear polarization degrees ranging from 0.4% to 0.8%
in both filters independently of spectral type and spectroscopic rotational
velocity. However, simple statistics point at the fastest rotators (vsini >=60
km s^{-1}) having a larger fraction of positive detections and a larger
averaged linear polarization degree than the moderately rotating dwarfs
(vsini=30--60 km s^{-1}). Our data suggest little linear polarimetric
variability on short time scales (i.e., observations separated by a few ten
rotation periods), and significant variability on long time scales (i.e.,
hundred to thousand rotation cycles), supporting the presence of ""long-term
weather"" in ultracool dwarf atmospheres.

show that Dirac gaugino mass terms map as lim_{mu->infty} mD/(g kappa^{1/(k+1}}

RG-invariant to all orders in perturbation theory, but establishing the mapping
in its entirety is not straightforward because Dirac masses are not the
spurions of holomorphic couplings in the N=1 theory. To circumvent this, we
first demonstrate that deforming the Kutasov theory can make it flow to an N=2
theory with parametrically small N=1 deformations. Using harmonic superspace
techniques we then show that the N=1 deformations can be recovered from
electric and magnetic FI-terms that break N=2 -> N=1, and also show that pure
Dirac mass terms can be induced by the same mechanism. We then find that the
proposed RG-invariant is indeed preserved under N=2 duality, and thence along
the flow to the dual N=1 Kutasov theories. Possible phenomenological

low-density super-Earths is whether these exoplanets are predominately
H2-dominated mini-Neptunes or volatile-rich worlds with gas envelopes dominated
by H2O, CO2, CO, CH4, or N2. Transit observations of the super-Earth GJ 1214b
rule out a cloud-free H2-dominated atmosphere, but are not able to determine
whether the lack of deep spectral features is due to high-altitude clouds or
the presence of a high mean molecular mass atmosphere. Here, we demonstrate
that one can unambiguously distinguish between cloudy mini-Neptunes and
volatile-dominated worlds based on the differences in the wing steepness and
relative depths of water absorption features in moderate-resolution NIR
transmission spectra (R~100). In a numerical retrieval study, we show for GJ
1214b that an unambiguous distinction between a cloudy H2-dominated atmosphere
and cloud-free H2 atmosphere will be possible if the uncertainties in the
spectral transit depth measurements can be reduced by a factor of ~3 compared
to the published HST WFC3 and VLT transit observations. We argue that the
required precision for the distinction may be achievable with currently
available instrumentation by stacking 10-15 transit observations. We provide a
scaling law that scales our quantitative results to other transiting
super-Earths and Neptunes such as HD 97658b, 55 Cnc e, and GJ 436b. The
analysis is performed using an improved version of our Bayesian atmospheric
retrieval framework. The new framework not only constrains the gas composition
and cloud/haze parameters, but also determines our confidence in having
detected molecules and cloud/haze species through Bayesian model comparison.
Using the Bayesian tool, we demonstrate quantitatively that the subtle transit
depth variation in the Berta et al. (2012) data is not sufficient to claim the

is compatible neither with the observed metal-rich populations found in giant

IMF to reconcile these observational constraints. In this model, an early
strong star-bursting stage with a top-heavy IMF is followed by a more prolonged
stage with a bottom-heavy IMF. Such model is physically motivated by the fact
that a sustained high star formation will bring the interstellar medium to a
state of pressure, temperature and turbulence that can drastically alter the
fragmentation of the gaseous component into small clumps, promoting the
formation of low-mass stars. This toy model is in good agreement with the
different observational constrains on massive elliptical galaxies, such as age,
metallicity, alpha-enhancement, M/L, or the mass fraction of the stellar
component in low-mass stars.

of the first galaxies at z~10 to the peak of formation activity at z~1-3. The
strong emission from the atmospheric background makes this type of survey
impossible from a ground-based observatory. The spectra of galaxies represent
the equivalent of a DNA fingerprint, containing information about the past
history of star formation and chemical enrichment. The proposed survey will
allow us to dissect the formation process of galaxies including the timescales
of quenching triggered by star formation or AGN activity, the effect of
environment, the role of infall/outflow processes, or the connection between
the galaxies and their underlying dark matter haloes. To provide these data,
the mission requires a 2.5m space telescope optimised for a campaign of very
deep NIR spectroscopy. A combination of a high multiplex and very long
integration times will result in the deepest, largest, high-quality
spectroscopic dataset of galaxies from z=1 to 12, spanning the history of the

masses and gas-phase metallicities based on the N2 strong-line metallicity

well-established trend between stellar mass and metallicity, such that more
massive galaxies have larger metallicities. The protocluster galaxies, however,
do not exhibit a dependence of metallicity on mass, with the low-mass
protocluster galaxies showing an enhancement in metallicity compared to field
galaxies spanning the same mass range. A comparison with galaxy formation
models suggests that the mass-dependent environmental trend we observed can be
qualitatively explained in the context of the recycling of ""momentum-driven""
galaxy wind material. Accordingly, winds are recycled on a shorter timescale in
denser environments, leading to an enhancement in metallicity at fixed mass for
all but the most massive galaxies. Future hydrodynamical simulations of z~2
overdensities matching the one in the HS1700 field will be crucial for
understanding the origin of the observed environmental trend in detail.

of high-mass star formation. The simulations show that magnetic fields play an
important role in the formation and dynamics of molecular outflows. Masers, in
particular 6.7-GHz CH3OH masers, are the best probes of the magnetic field
morphologies around massive young stellar objects on the smallest scales of
10-100 AU. This paper focuses on 4 massive young stellar objects,
IRAS06058+2138-NIRS1, IRAS22272+6358A, S255-IR, and S231, which complement our
previous 2012 sample (the first EVN group). From all these sources, molecular
outflows have been detected in the past. Seven of the European VLBI Network
antennas were used to measure the linear polarization and Zeeman-splitting of
the 6.7-GHz CH3OH masers in the star-forming regions in this second EVN group.
We detected a total of 128 CH3OH masing cloudlets. Fractional linear
polarization (0.8%-11.3%) was detected towards 18% of the CH3OH masers in our
sample. The linear polarization vectors are well ordered in all the massive
young stellar objects. We measured significant Zeeman-splitting in
IRAS06058+2138-NIRS1 (DVz=3.8+/-0.6 m/s) and S255-IR (DVz=3.2+/-0.7 m/s). By
considering the 20 massive young stellar objects towards which the morphology
of magnetic fields was determined by observing 6.7-GHz CH3OH masers in both
hemispheres, we find no evident correlation between the linear distributions of
CH3OH masers and the outflows or the linear polarization vectors. On the other
hand, we present first statistical evidence that the magnetic field (on scales
10-100 AU) is primarily oriented along the large-scale outflow direction.
Moreover, we empirically find that the linear polarization fraction of
unsaturated CH3OH masers is P_l<4.5%.

to measure inhomogeneities in the gas distribution from X-ray observations of

observations of Abell 133 and present the determination of the gas clumping
factor from X-ray cluster data. We find that the gas clumping factor in Abell
133 increases with radius and reaches $\sim 2-3$ at $0.9\,R_{200}$. This is in
good agreement with the predictions of hydrodynamical simulations and our
previous determination. We then observe a general trend of steepening in the
radial profiles of the clumping-corrected gas density beyond $0.3\, R_{200}$,
with a logarithmic slope of $\sim 2.6$ at $0.9\,R_{200}$. The observed density
profiles appear to be flatter compared to simulations, but in agreement with
previous observational findings. In addition, we observe that the measured
temperature decreases steadily with radius toward the outskirts of A133, while
the entropy increases monotonically with radius, gently flattening in the outer
volumes. With respect to theoretical predictions from pure gravitational
collapse, the results presented here point to an entropy excess in the central
regions, which extends out to large radii. These results suggest that gas
inhomogeneities should be treated properly when interpreting X-ray measurements
in the envelope of galaxy clusters. We finally discuss how the brightness
distribution keeps a record of the large-scale structures formation scenario,
providing a snapshot of the 'melting pot' in the virialization region.

massive stars in protocluster forming clumps imposes dual constraints on the
star formation efficiencies (SFEs) and stellar age spreads ($\Delta \tau_{*}$)
in stellar clusters. We have considered two main classes of clump models. One
class of models in one in which the core formation efficiency (CFE) per unit
time and as a consequence the star formation rate (SFR) is constant in time and
another class of models in which the CFE per unit time, and as a consequence
the SFR, increases with time. Models with an increasing mode of star formation
yield shorter age spreads (a few 0.1 Myrs) and typically higher SFEs than
models in which star formation is uniform in time. We find that the former
models reproduce remarkably well the SFE$-\Delta \tau_{*}$ values of starburst
clusters such as NGC 3603 YC and Westerlund 1, while the latter describe better
the star formation process in lower density environments such as in the Orion
Nebula Cluster. We also show that the SFE and $\Delta \tau_{*}$ of massive
clusters are expected to be higher in low metallicity environments. This could
be tested with future large extragalactic surveys of stellar clusters. We
advocate that placing a stellar cluster on the SFE-$\Delta \tau_{*}$ diagram is
a powerful method to distinguish between different stellar clusters formation
scenarios such as between generic gravitational instability of a gas
cloud/clump or as the result of cloud-cloud collisions. It is also a very
useful tool for testing star formation theories and numerical models versus the
observations.

low-mass stars. The LDB implies a cluster age of 22 +/-4 Myr and is quite
insensitive to choice of evolutionary model. NGC 1960 is the youngest cluster

main sequence and a rich low-mass pre-main sequence. The LDB age determined

isochrone fits to its high- and low-mass populations. The concordance between
these three age estimation techniques, that rely on different facets of stellar
astrophysics at very different masses, is an important step towards calibrating

real-time dynamics of correlated lattice-fermion models far from thermal
equilibrium. This is achieved by means of a reformulation of the original
equilibrium theory in terms of double-time Green's functions on the
Keldysh-Matsubara contour. We construct a functional which is stationary at the
physical (nonequilibrium) self-energy and which yields the grand potential of
the initial thermal state at the physical point. Non-perturbative
approximations can be defined by specifying a reference system that serves to
generate trial self-energies. These self-energies are varied by varying the
reference system's one-particle parameters on the Keldysh-Matsubara contour. In
case of thermal equilibrium, the new approach reduces to the conventional SFT.
However, ""unphysical"" variations, i.e., variations that are different on the
upper and the lower branch of the Keldysh contour, must be considered to fix
the time-dependence of the optimal physical parameters via the variational
principle. Functional derivatives in the nonequilibrium SFT Euler equation are
carried out analytically to derive conditional equations for the variational
parameters that are accessible to a numerical evaluation via a time-propagation
scheme. Approximations constructed by means of the nonequilibrium SFT are shown
to be inherently causal, internally consistent and to respect macroscopic
conservation laws resulting from gauge symmetries of the Hamiltonian. This
comprises the nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory but also
dynamical-impurity and variational-cluster approximations that are specified by
reference systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom. In this way,
non-perturbative and consistent approximations can be set up, the numerical
evaluation of which is accessible to an exact-diagonalization approach.

theories in soft and collinear limits. Here, we take a small step towards a
more transparent understanding of these limits by proving a form of
perturbative factorization at tree- level using on-shell spinor helicity
methods. We present a concrete and self-contained expression of factorization
in which matrix elements in QCD are related to products of other matrix
elements in QCD up to leading order in a power-counting parameter determined by
the momenta of certain physical on-shell states. Our approach uses only the
scaling of momenta in soft and collinear limits, avoiding any assignment of
scaling behavior to unphysical (and gauge-dependent) fields. The proof of
factorization exploits many advantages of helicity spinors, such as the freedom
to choose different reference vectors for polarizations in different collinear
sectors. An advantage of this approach is that once factorization is shown to
hold in QCD, the transition to Soft-Collinear Effective Theory is effortless.

thoroughly the current status of internal bremsstrahlung searches in light of
the results of direct dark matter searches and in the framework of a minimal
mass-degenerate scenario consisting of a Majorana dark matter particle that
couples to a fermion and a scalar via a Yukawa coupling. The upper limits on
the annihilation cross section set by Fermi-LAT and H.E.S.S. extend
uninterrupted from tens of GeV up to tens of TeV and are rather insensitive to
the mass degeneracy in the particle physics model. In contrast, direct searches
are best in the moderate to low mass splitting regime, where XENON100 limits
overshadow Fermi-LAT and H.E.S.S. up to TeV masses if dark matter couples to
one of the light quarks. In our minimal scenario we examine carefully the
prospects for GAMMA-400, CTA and XENON1T, all planned to come online in the
near future, and find that: (a) CTA and XENON1T are fully complementary, with
CTA most sensitive to multi-TeV masses and mass splittings around 10%, and
XENON1T probing best small mass splittings up to TeV masses; and (b) current
constraints from XENON100 already preclude the observation of any spectral
feature with GAMMA-400 in spite of its impressive energy resolution, unless
dark matter does not couple predominantly to light quarks. Finally, we point
out that, unlike for direct searches, the possibility of detecting thermal
relics in upcoming internal bremsstrahlung searches requires, depending on the
concrete scenario, boost factors larger than 5-10.

  I will carefully examine the fundamental reasons why what has been discovered
might not be the standard model Higgs. Dynamical electroweak breaking naturally
addresses a number of the fundamental issues unsolved by the standard model
interpretation. However this paradigm has been challenged by the discovery of a
not-so-heavy Higgs-like state. I will therefore review the recent discovery
\cite{Foadi:2012bb} that the standard model top-induced radiative corrections
naturally reduce the intrinsic non-perturbative mass of the composite Higgs
state towards the desired experimental value. Not only we have a natural and
testable working framework but we have also suggested specific gauge theories
that can realise, at the fundamental level, these minimal models of dynamical
electroweak symmetry breaking. These strongly coupled gauge theories are now
being heavily investigated via first principle lattice simulations with
encouraging results.
  The new findings show that the recent naive claims made about new strong
dynamics at the electroweak scale being disfavoured by the discovery of a
not-so-heavy composite Higgs are unwarranted.
  I will then introduce the more speculative idea of extreme compositeness
according to which not only the Higgs sector of the standard model is composite
but also quarks and leptons, and provide a toy example in the form of
gauge-gauge duality.

for the mean vorticity in the electromotive force and for the mean
magnetic-field strain in the Reynolds stress tensor. This suggests that the
cross-helicity effects are important in the cases where global inhomogeneous
flow and magnetic-field structures are present. Since such large-scale
structures are ubiquitous in geo/astrophysical phenomena, the cross-helicity
effect is expected to play an important role in geo/astrophysical flows. In the
presence of turbulent cross helicity, the mean vortical motion contributes to
the turbulent electromotive force. Magnetic-field generation due to this effect
is called the cross-helicity dynamo. Several features of the cross-helicity
dynamo are introduced. Unlike the case in the helicity or $\alpha$ effect,
where ${\bf{J}}$ is aligned with ${\bf{B}}$ in the turbulent electromotive
force, we in general have a finite mean-field Lorentz force ${\bf{J}} \times
{\bf{B}}$ in the cross-helicity dynamo. This gives a distinguished feature of
the cross-helicity effect. By considering the effects of cross helicity in the
momentum equation, we see several interesting consequences of the effect.
Turbulent cross helicity coupled with the mean magnetic shear reduces the
effect of turbulent or eddy viscosity. Flow induction is an important
consequence of this effect. One key issue in the cross-helicity dynamo is to
examine how and how much cross helicity can be present in turbulence. On the
basis of the cross-helicity transport equation, its production mechanisms are
discussed. Some recent developments in numerical validation of the basic notion
of the cross-helicity dynamo are also presented.

metal carbonyls, Mousavi and Frenking have declared the absence of bond paths,
the so-called missed bond paths, between metal atoms and terminal carbon atoms
in several complexes. In this communication, it is first demonstrated that the
presupposition of the equivalence of a bond path and a chemical bond within the
context of the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) is superficial and
basically flawed which is not only against with the recent strict declaration
on the contrary [R.F.W. Bader, J. Phys. Chem. A 113 (2009) 10396], but also in
odd with the foundations of the QTAIM. Then, it is demonstrated that the
so-called missed bond paths indeed appear in molecular graphs of some
non-equilibrium geometries that are energetically quite accessible at room
temperatures. To emphasize on the importance of this observation the term
passionate neighbors is coined referring to the atomic basins that do not share
an inter-atomic surface at the equilibrium geometry but are neighbors, share an
inter-atomic surface, at non-equilibrium geometries accessible by nuclear
vibrations. Using the delocalization index as well as other evidence from
previous literature it is demonstrated that the QTAIM analysis is indeed
compatible with the presence of chemical bonds between iron metal and terminal
carbons in (CO)3Fe-TMM complex. Finally, some general discussions are done to
unravel the delicate relationship between the QTAIM proposed concepts, e.g.
bond paths and molecular graphs, and some orthodox concepts of chemistry, e.g.
chemical bonds and chemical structures, emphasizing that there is no one-to-one
relationship between these two categorizes.

indicates a sligthly higher fraction of fast rotators for the lower mass
objects, although the lower and upper envelopes of the rotation period
distribution, located respectively at ~0.2-0.3d and ~10d, are remarkably flat
over the whole mass range. We combine this period distribution with previous
results obtained in younger and older clusters to model the angular momentum
evolution of low mass stars during the PMS. The h Per cluster provides the
first statistically robust estimate of the rotational period distribution of
solar-type and lower mass stars at the end of the PMS accretion phase (>10
Myr). The results are consistent with models that assume significant
core-envelope decoupling during the angular momentum evolution to the ZAMS.

a 125 GeV Higgs without fine-tuning. These models contain additional `auxiliary
Higgs' fields with large tree-level quartic interaction terms but no Yukawa
couplings. These have electroweak-breaking vacuum expectation values, and
contribute to the VEVs of the MSSM Higgs fields either through an induced
quartic or through an induced tadpole. The quartic interactions for the
auxiliary Higgs fields can arise from either D-terms or F-terms. The tadpole
mechanism has been previously studied in strongly-coupled models with large
D-terms, referred to as `superconformal technicolor.' The perturbative models
studied here preserve gauge coupling unification in the simplest possible way,
namely that all new fields are in complete SU(5) multiplets. The models are
consistent with the observed properties of the 125 GeV Higgs-like boson as well
as precision electroweak constraints, and predict a rich phenomenology of new
Higgs states at the weak scale. The tuning is less than 10% in almost all of
the phenomenologically allowed parameter space. If electroweak symmetry is

a Bogoliubov quasiparticle (qp) RPA formalism. This work is a follow-up to our
previous formal proof on the connection between particle-hole (ph) RPA and
ring-CCD. Whereas RPA is a quasibosonic approximation, CC theory is a correct
bosonization in the sense that the wavefunction and Hilbert space are exactly
fermionic. Coupled cluster theory achieves this goal by interacting the ph
(ring) and pp (ladder) diagrams via a third channel that we here call
""crossed-ring"" whose presence allows for full fermionic antisymmetry.
Additionally, coupled cluster incorporates what we call ""mosaic"" terms which
can be absorbed into defining a new effective one-body Hamiltonian. The
inclusion of these mosaic terms seems to be quite important. The pp-RPA an d
qp-RPA equations are textbook material in nuclear structure physics but are
largely unknown in quantum chemistry, where particle number fluctuations and
Bogoliubov determinants are rarely used. We believe that the ideas and

nonlinear systems with power-law memory derived from fractional differential
equations. To study fractional maps we use the notion of $\alpha$-families of
maps depending on a single parameter $\alpha > 0$ which is the order of the
fractional derivative in a nonlinear fractional differential equation

represent a very general form of multi-dimensional nonlinear maps with
power-law memory, in which the weight of the previous state at time $t_i$ in
defining the present state at time $t$ is proportional to
$(t-{t_i})^{\alpha-1}$. They may be applicable to studying some systems with
memory such as viscoelastic materials, electromagnetic fields in dielectric
media, Hamiltonian systems, adaptation in biological systems, human memory,

examples we demonstrate that the phase space of nonlinear fractional dynamical

attracting accelerator mode trajectories, chaotic attractors, and cascade of
bifurcations type trajectories %with some new properties. whose properties are

subspace, even when the estimated statistics become erroneous (e.g., due to
sudden changes of environments). Therefore, compared with those existing
methods, the proposed algorithm is more suited to adaptive filtering
applications. The algorithm is analyzed based on a modified version of the
adaptive projected subgradient method (APSM). Numerical examples demonstrate
that the proposed algorithm enjoys better tracking performance than the
existing methods for the interference suppression problem in code-division
multiple-access (CDMA) systems as well as for simple system identification
problems.

$Ks$ bands with NaCo at the VLT. Combining these images with classical
PSF-subtraction, we are able to derive the polarization degree of this disk. At
$H$ band the polarization degree of the disk varies between 10% and 25%. This
result cannot be reproduced by dust distributions containing highly porous
material. The polarization is better matched by distributions of compact
particles, with maximum sizes at least up to a few microns, in agreement with
previous observations. We also observe two regions of low emission (nulls) in
total and in polarized intensity. In particular, one of these nulls is at
roughly the same position as the maximum of the horse-shoe shape observed in
sub-millimeter continuum emission ALMA Band-7 (345 GHz) observations. We
discuss the possible link between both features.

to explain the dynamics of astronomical systems based only on their baryonic
matter. The effect of the vector field in the theory resembles a Lorentz force
where each mass has a charge proportional to the inertial mass. In this work,
we obtain the weak field approximation of MOG by perturbing the metric and the
fields around Minkowski space-time. We derive an effective gravitational
potential which yields the Newtonian attractive force plus a repulsive Yukawa
force. This potential, in addition to the Newtonian gravitational constant,
$G_N$, has two additional constant parameters $\alpha$ and $\mu$. We use the
THINGS catalog of galaxies and fix the two parameters $\alpha$ and $\mu$ of the
theory to be $\alpha =8.89 \pm 0.34$ and $\mu =0.04 \pm 0.004 {\rm kpc}^{-1}$.
We then apply the effective potential with the fixed universal parameters to
the Ursa-Major catalog of galaxies and obtain good fits to galaxy rotation
curve data with an average value of $\bar{\chi^2} = 1.07 $. In the fitting
process, only the stellar mass-to-light ratio $(M/L)$ of the galaxies is a free
parameter. As predictions of MOG, our derived $M/L$ is shown to be correlated
with the color of galaxies, and we fit the Tully-Fisher relation for galaxies.
As an alternative to dark matter, introducing an effective weak field potential
for MOG opens a new window to the astrophysical applications of the theory.

observations of 8 transits and four occultations using the 1.5m Danish
Telescope, 14 transits at the PEST observatory, and 1 transit observed
simultaneously through four optical and three near-infrared filters, using the
GROND instrument on the ESO 2.2m telescope. We use these new data to measure
refined physical parameters for the system. We find the planet to be more
bloated and the system to be twice as old as initially thought. We also used
published and archived datasets to study the transit timings, which do not
depart from a linear ephemeris. We detected an anomaly in the GROND transit
light curve which is compatible with a spot on the photosphere of the parent
star. The starspot position, size, spot contrast and temperature were
established. Using our new and published measurements, we assembled the
planet's transmission spectrum over the 370-2350 nm wavelength range and its
emission spectrum over the 750-8000 nm range. By comparing these data to
theoretical models we investigated the theoretically-predicted variation of the
apparent radius of WASP-19b as a function of wavelength and studied the
composition and thermal structure of its atmosphere. We conclude that: there is
no evidence for strong optical absorbers at low pressure, supporting the common
idea that the planet's atmosphere lacks a dayside inversion; the temperature of
the planet is not homogenized, because the high warming of its dayside causes
the planet to be more efficient in re-radiating than redistributing energy to
the night side; the planet seems to be outside of any current classification
scheme.

production rates, relate to the (partial) restoration of chiral symmetry. In
particular, we show how chiral and QCD sum rules, together with constraints
from lattice QCD, can render these relations quantitative. Turning to dilepton
data, we elaborate on updates in the space-time evolution and quark-gluon
plasma emission rates from lattice-QCD calculations. With a now available
excitation function in dilepton spectra from the RHIC beam-energy scan
connecting down to SPS energies, we argue that a consistent interpretation of
dilepton data emerges. Combining well-constrained space-time evolutions with
state-of-the-art emission rates identifies most of the radiation to emanate
from around the pseudo-critical temperature, and thus confirms resonance
melting as the prevalent mechanism in this regime, compatible with chiral
restoration. Recent measurements of a relatively soft slope and large elliptic
flow in direct-photon spectra at RHIC and LHC lend further support to this
picture.

for it to stably recover compressible signals under noise? Whether coherent
dictionaries allow the existence of sensing matrices that guarantee good
performances of the L1-synthesis method? To answer these questions, we build up
a framework for the L1-synthesis method. In particular, we propose a
dictionary-based null space property DNSP which, to the best of our knowledge,
is the first sufficient and necessary condition for the success of L1-synthesis
without measurement noise. With this new property, we show that when the
dictionary D is full spark, it cannot be too coherent otherwise the method

representative compounds of copper oxide families---cation doped
Ca_2-xNa_xCuO2Cl2 and La_2-xAe_xCuO4 (Ae = Ba, Sr), as well as oxygen enriched
YBa2Cu3O_6+x ---are explained with the Coulomb-oscillator model of
superconductivity. By the model, non-resistive current is carried by axial
Coulomb oscillations of s electrons through neighbor nuclei---here excited 3s
electrons from O^2- ions through next-nearest neighbor oxygen nuclei---if their
accompanying lateral oscillation is sufficiently confined to prevent lateral
overswing. Cation doping gives rise to a superlattice in the layers that
sandwich each CuO2 plane. In Ca_2-xNa_xCuO2Cl2, having one CuO2 plane per unit
cell, superconductivity emerges when laterally confined Coulomb oscillators
start connecting along 6 x 6 superlattice domains (in units of planar lattice
constants) and it peaks at 4 x 4 domains when, at doping x = 1/8, the
superlattice is completed. With further doping a new, off-set superlattice
grows. Its frustrating effect gradually reduces superconductivity to cessation.
The same mechanism holds for La_2-xAe_xCuO4 which has two, staggered CuO2
planes per unit cell. The staggering causes superconducting frustration or
boost between adjacent layer sandwiches. This results in a double hump of the
transition temperature Tc(x), instead of a dome, with a deep furrow or dip at x
= 1/8 for Ae = Ba or Sr, respectively. Oxygen enrichment of YBa2Cu3O_6+x
indirectly leads to effective doping in the CuO2 planes themselves (Cu^2+ -->
Cu^3+). The ionization of copper ions at the corners of planar unit cells
determines whether lateral oscillations between next-nearest neighbor O^2- ions
overswing (Tc = 0) or are confined to wide or narrow electron tracks. Their
percolating connectivity gives rise to respective plateaus of Tc = 57 K and Tc
= 90 K, and intermediate ramps.

applications emerging on Infrastructure-asa-Service (IaaS) clouds, and many
workflow service providers offering workflow as a service (WaaS). The major
concern of WaaS providers is to minimize the monetary cost of executing
workflows in the IaaS cloud. While there have been previous studies on this
concern, most of them assume static task execution time and static pricing
scheme, and have the QoS notion of satisfying a deterministic deadline.
However, cloud environment is dynamic, with performance dynamics caused by the
interference from concurrent executions and price dynamics like spot prices
offered by Amazon EC2. Therefore, we argue that WaaS providers should have the
notion of offering probabilistic performance guarantees for individual
workflows on IaaS clouds. We develop a probabilistic scheduling framework
called Dyna to minimize the monetary cost while offering probabilistic deadline
guarantees. The framework includes an A*-based instance configuration method
for performance dynamics, and a hybrid instance configuration refinement for
utilizing spot instances. Experimental results with three real-world scientific
workflow applications on Amazon EC2 demonstrate (1) the accuracy of our
framework on satisfying the probabilistic deadline guarantees required by the
users; (2) the effectiveness of our framework on reducing monetary cost in
comparison with the existing approaches.

show that, for convex polynomial optimization, the Lasserre hierarchy with a
slightly extended quadratic module always converges asymptotically even in the
face of non-compact semi-algebraic feasible sets. We do this by exploiting a
coercivity property of convex polynomials that are bounded below. We further
establish that the positive definiteness of the Hessian of the associated
Lagrangian at a saddle-point (rather than the objective function at each
minimizer) guarantees finite convergence of the hierarchy. We obtain finite
convergence by first establishing a new sum-of-squares polynomial
representation of convex polynomials over convex semi-algebraic sets under a

$\alpha$ and $\beta$ to be function of redshift, $z$. We find no evidence for
the redshift evolution of $\alpha$. We find that without flux-averaging SNe,
$\beta$ is consistent with being a constant when only statistical uncertainties
are included, but it increases significantly with $z$ when systematic
uncertainties are also included. The evolution of $\beta$ becomes marginal when
all the SNe are flux-averaged, and $\beta$ is consistent with being a constant
when only SNe at $z\ge 0.04$ are flux-averaged. Our results are insensitive to
the lightcurve fitter used to derive the SNLS3 sample, or the functional form
of $\alpha(z)$ and $\beta(z)$ assumed. It is likely that the apparent evolution
of $\beta$ with $z$ for SNe without flux-averaging is a consequence of unknown
systematic effects; flux-averaging reduces the impact of these effects by
averaging them within each redshift bin. Assuming constant $\alpha$ and
$\beta$, we find that the flux-averaging of SNe has a significant impact on the
distance-redshift relation.

challenging for Bayesians to attempt to model the true data generating
mechanism. Moreover, when the object of interest is low dimensional, such as a
mean or median, it is cumbersome to have to achieve this via a complete model
for the whole data distribution. More importantly, there are settings where the
parameter of interest does not directly index a family of density functions and
thus the Bayesian approach to learning about such parameters is currently
regarded as problematic. Our proposed framework uses loss-functions to connect
information in the data to functionals of interest. The updating of beliefs
then follows from a decision theoretic approach involving cumulative loss
functions. Importantly, the procedure coincides with Bayesian updating when a
true likelihood is known, yet provides coherent subjective inference in much
more general settings. Connections to other inference frameworks are
highlighted.

The soft X-ray light curve shows a moderate orbital modulation and a dip. We
investigated the nature of the dip by comparing the X-ray light curve with the
prediction of the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion theory, assuming both
spherical and nonspherical symmetry of the outflow from the donor star. We
found that the dip cannot be explained with the X-ray orbital modulation. We
propose that an eclipse or the onset of a gated mechanism is the most likely

lattice Boltzmann (LB) model, which has attracted much attention as a
mesoscopic model for simulating interfacial dynamics of complex fluids, but
suffers from the problem that the surface tension cannot be tuned independently
of the density ratio. In the literature, a multi-range potential was devised to
adjust the surface tension [Sbragaglia et al., Phys. Rev. E 75, 026702 (2007)].
However, it was recently found that the density ratio of the system will be
changed when the multi-range potential is employed to adjust the surface
tension. A new approach is therefore proposed in the present work. The basic
strategy is to add a source term to the LB equation so as to tune the surface
tension of the pseudopotential LB model. The proposed approach can guarantee
that the adjustment of the surface tension does not affect the mechanical
stability condition of the pseudopotential LB model, and thus provides a
separate control of the surface tension and the density ratio. Meanwhile, it
still retains the mesoscopic feature and the computational simplicity of the
pseudopotential LB model. Numerical simulations are carried out for stationary
droplets, capillary waves, and droplet splashing on a thin liquid film. The
numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach is capable of
achieving a tunable surface tension over a very wide range and can keep the
density ratio unchanged when adjusting the surface tension.

with the Co concentration in contradiction with previous calculations but in
agreement with recent experiments. This dependence is explained from bulk
properties of the alloys. By using a realistic description of the disorder in
the alloys we can show that even small amounts of disorder lead to a drastic
drop in the tunneling magnetoresistance. This provides a quantitative
explanation of the difference between calculated and measured values.
  The spin-transfer torque shows a linear voltage dependence for the in-plane
component and a quadratic for the out-of-plane component for all concentrations
at small bias voltages. In particular, the linear slope of the in-plane torque
is independent of the concentration. For high bias voltages the in-plane torque
shows a strong nonlinear deviation from the linear slope for high Co

phenomena characterized by a low saturation magnetization and perpendicular

cosmic ray (CR) acceleration in young supernova remnant (SNR) shocks. The width
of the broad Balmer line is a direct indicator of the downstream plasma
temperature. In case of efficient particle acceleration an appreciable fraction
of the total kinetic energy of the plasma is channeled into CRs, therefore the
downstream temperature decreases and so does the broad Balmer line width. This
width also depends on the level of thermal equilibration between ions and
neutral hydrogen atoms in the downstream. Since in general in young SNR shocks
only a few charge exchange (CE) reactions occur before ionization,
equilibration between ions and neutrals is not reached, and a kinetic
description of the neutrals is required in order to properly compute Balmer
emission.
  We provide a method for the calculation of Balmer emission using a
self-consistent description of the shock structure in the presence of neutrals
and CRs. We use a recently developed semi-analytical approach, where neutral
particles, ionized plasma, accelerated particles and magnetic fields are all
coupled together through the mass, momentum and energy flux conservation
equations. The distribution of neutrals is obtained from the full Boltzmann
equation in velocity space, coupled to Maxwellian ions through ionization and
CE processes. The computation is also improved with respect to previous work
thanks to a better approximation for the atomic interaction rates. We find that
for shock speeds >2500km/s the distribution of broad neutrals never approaches
a Maxwellian and its moments differ from those of the ionized component. These
differences reflect into a smaller FWHM than predicted in previous
calculations, where thermalization was assumed. The method presented here
provides a realistic estimate of particle acceleration efficiency in Balmer
dominated shocks.

associated with magnetic intermittent events, but also with gradient-type

refraction indices and the photon absorption coefficients are obtained in
various asymptotic regimes of interest. The outcomes of this analysis reveal
that, far from the region relatively close to the threshold of the two-photon

cases, strongly suppressed. On the contrary, in a vicinity of the region in

of the intrinsic alignment signal (II-alignments) and GI-alignments (the cross
correlation of intrinsic and lensing induced ellipticities). Evaluating the
covariance matrices for the linear model numerically and comparing the results
to the cosmic shear signal we find that for a low redshift survey the total
covariance matrix is dominated by the contributions of the II-alignments. For a
Euclid-like survey II-alignments still dominate over GI-alignments but they are
more than one order of magnitude smaller than the lensing signal. The shape of
the ellipticity covariance matrices is quite different in the k-k'-plane for
cosmic shear on the one hand and intrinsic alignments on the other hand. In
comparison to lensing both alignment types tend to be rather elongated along
the diagonal k=k'. Moreover, for high multipoles (l ~ 100) intrinsic alignments
are strongly concentrated along that diagonal.

active galactic nuclei (AGN) to suppress the formation of stars and thus
prevent the over-production of very massive systems. While some observations
provide evidence for such negative feedback, other studies find either no
feedback, or even positive feedback, with increased star formation associated
with higher AGN luminosities. Here we report an analysis of several hundred AGN
and their host galaxies in the Chandra Deep Field South using X-ray and radio
data for sample selection. Combined with archival far infrared data as a
reliable tracer of star formation activity in the AGN host galaxies, we find
that AGN with pronounced radio jets exhibit a much higher star formation rate
than the purely X-ray selected ones, even at the same X-ray luminosities. This
difference implies that positive AGN feedback plays an important role, too, and
therefore has to be accounted for in all future simulation work. We interpret
this to indicate that the enhanced star formation rate of radio selected AGN
arises because of jet-induced star formation, as is hinted by the different jet
powers among our AGN samples, while the suppressed star formation rate of X-ray
selected AGN is caused by heating and photo-dissociation of molecular gas by
the hot AGN accretion disc.

evolutionary link between the prestellar and protostellar phases, are vital for
probing the earliest phases of star formation. We aim to determine the
dynamical state of the First Hydrostatic Core candidate Cha-MMS1. We observed
Cha-MMS1 in various transitions with the APEX and Mopra telescopes. The
molecular emission was modeled with a radiative transfer code to derive
constraints on the envelope kinematics. We derive an internal luminosity of
0.08 - 0.18 Lsol. An average velocity gradient of 3.1(0.1) km/s/pc over 0.08 pc
is found perpendicular to the filament in which Cha-MMS1 is embedded. The
gradient is flatter in the outer parts and at the innermost 2000 - 4000 AU.
These features suggest solid-body rotation beyond 4000 AU and slower,
differential rotation beyond 8000 AU. The origin of the flatter gradient in the
innermost parts is unclear. The classical infall signature is detected in HCO+
3-2 and CS 2-1. The radiative transfer modeling indicates a uniform infall
velocity in the outer parts of the envelope. An infall velocity field scaling
with r^(-0.5) is consistent with the data for r < 9000 AU. The infall
velocities are 0.1 - 0.2 km/s at r > 3300 AU and 0.04 - 0.6 km/s at r < 3300
AU. Both the internal luminosity of Cha-MMS1 and the infall velocity field in
its envelope are consistent with predictions of MHD simulations for the first
core phase. There is no evidence for a fast, large-scale outflow stemming from
Cha-MMS1 but excess emission from the high-density tracers CS 5-4, CO 6-5, and
CO 7-6 suggests the presence of higher-velocity material at the inner core. Its
internal luminosity excludes Cha-MMS1 being a prestellar core. The kinematical
properties of its envelope are consistent with Cha-MMS1 being a first core
candidate or a very young Class 0 protostar.(abridged).

J=2-1 line features a much less pronounced, but similar, asymmetry. The J=2-1
emission from 12CO and its main isotopologues have no resolved spatial
asymmetry. We associate this behavior as the direct signature of a vertical
temperature gradient and layered molecular structure in the disk. This is
demonstrated using both toy models and more sophisticated calculations assuming
non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non LTE) conditions. A model disk
structure is developed to reproduce both the distinctive spatial morphology of
the 12CO J=3-2 line as well as the J=2-1 emission from the CO isotopologues
assuming relative abundances consistent with the interstellar medium. This
model disk structure has tau=1 emitting surfaces for the 12CO emission lines
that make an angle of about 15 degrees with respect to the disk midplane.
Furthermore, we show that the spatial and spectral sensitivity of these data
can distinguish between models that have sub-Keplerian gas velocities due to
the vertical extent of the disk and its associated radial pressure gradient (a
fractional difference in the bulk gas velocity field of approximately greater
than 5%).

and laboratory plasmas with complex three dimensional (3D) magnetic topologies.
This work presents kinematic analytical models for spine and fan reconnection
at a symmetric 3D null with asymmetric current sheets. Asymmetric fan
reconnection is characterized by an asymmetric reconnection of flux past each
spine line and a bulk flow of plasma across the null point. In contrast,
asymmetric spine reconnection is inherently equal and opposite in how flux is
reconnected across the fan plane. The higher modes of spine reconnection also
include localized wedges of vortical flux transport in each half of the fan. In
this situation, two definitions for reconnection rate become appropriate: a
local reconnection rate quantifying how much flux is genuinely reconnected
across the fan plane and a global rate associated with the net flux driven
across each semi-plane. Through a scaling analysis it is shown that when the
ohmic dissipation in the layer is assumed to be constant, the increase in the
local rate bleeds from the global rate as the sheet deformation is increased.
Both models suggest that asymmetry in the current sheet dimensions will have a
profound effect on the reconnection rate and manner of flux transport in
reconnection involving 3D nulls.

15, 79-95) is extended so that the structural changes caused by plastic
deformation are taken into account. It is found that the type of evolution
assigned to the slip systems of a constituent crystal influences significantly
the structure of the constitutive system characterizing the overall response.
In particular, the classical normality structure is obtained only if slip
systems are assumed to convect with the crystal lattice. Any other type of slip
system evolution induces a deviation of the macro-rate of plastic deformation
from the exterior normal to the yield surface. This provides a physical
explanation and also a rigorous definition for the much debated concept of
plastic spin.

Interestingly, the LTI multiferroic phase with a spiral (cycloidal) magnetic

along the cycloid propagation due to the site-dependent symmetry properties of
the mixed representations. In the HTI phase a finite imaginary part of the
spine magnetic moment could be deduced yielding a spin cycloid instead of a
purely sinusoidal structure with an opposite spin chirality for different spine
spin chains. The magnetic ordering of the cross-tie sites in both phases is
different in comparison to the respective ones in the pure Ni compound. A wider
temperature stability range of the HTI phase has been observed in comparison to

primary goal of each experiment was to effect sensitive searches for neutrino
oscillations in the mass region with $\Delta m^2 \sim 1$ eV$^2$. The two
experiments are complementary, and so the comparison of results can bring
additional information with respect to models with sterile neutrinos. Both
experiments obtained evidence for $\bar \nu_\mu \rightarrow \bar \nu_e$
oscillations, and MiniBooNE also observed a $\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_e$ excess.
In this paper, we review the design, analysis, and results from these
experiments. We then consider the results within the global context of sterile
neutrino oscillation models. The final data sets require a more extended model
than the simple single sterile neutrino model imagined at the time that LSND
drew to a close and MiniBooNE began. We show that there are apparent
incompatibilities between data sets in models with two sterile neutrinos.
However, these incompatibilities may be explained with variations within the
systematic error. Overall, models with two (or three) sterile neutrinos seem to
succeed in fitting the global data, and they make interesting predictions for
future experiments.

redshifts of brighter cluster galaxies to estimate the velocity dispersion of
galaxy clusters from both simulated and observational galaxy catalogues. We
select clusters with Ngal > 50 at five low redshift snapshots from a
semi-analytic model galaxy catalogue, and from a catalogue of SDSS DR8 groups
and clusters across the redshift range 0.021<z<0.098. We employ various
selection techniques to explore whether the velocity dispersion bias is simply
due to a lack of dynamical information or is the result of an underlying
physical process occurring in the cluster, for example, dynamical friction. The
velocity dispersions and stacked particle velocity distributions of the parent
dark matter (DM) halos are compared to the corresponding cluster dispersions
and galaxy velocity distribution. We find a clear bias between the halo and the
semi-analytic galaxy cluster velocity dispersion on the order of sigma gal /
sigma DM = 0.87-0.95 and a distinct difference in the stacked galaxy and DM
particle velocity distribution. We identify a systematic underestimation of the
velocity dispersions when imposing increasing absolute I-band magnitude limits.
This underestimation is enhanced when using only the brighter cluster members
for dynamical analysis on the order of 5-35%, indicating that dynamical
friction is a serious source of bias when using galaxy velocities as tracers of
the underlying gravitational potential. In contrast to the literature we find
that the resulting bias is not only halo mass-dependent but that the nature of
the dependence changes according to the galaxy selection strategy. We make a
recommendation that, in the realistic case of limited availability of spectral
observations, a strictly magnitude-limited sample should be avoided to ensure
an unbiased estimate of the velocity dispersion.

decrease in the ELM energy. The reduced ELM energy decreases the peak heat flux

Our local group of
galaxies, for example, drifts relative to the Hubble flow at about 600 km/sec.
Such bulk flows are believed to fade away as we move on to progressively larger
scales. Recently, however, there have been reports of peculiar motions larger
and faster than typically expected. If these claims are correct, the role of
peculiar flows in shaping the kinematics of our universe has been probably
underestimated. Here, we use general relativistic techniques to analyse the
average kinematics of large-scale bulk motions and compute the nonlinear
Raychaudhuri equation of such flows. In doing so, we introduce two families of
observers. One at rest with the Hubble expansion and another following the
peculiar motion. We first derive the fully nonlinear expressions of the
""peculiar"" Raychaudhuri equation in both frames and identify a range of
relative motion effects. Linearised around a Friedmann universe with
pressureless dust, the full equations reduce to a simple relation with no
explicit contribution from the matter component of the universe. Using
cosmological perturbation theory, we obtain a scale-dependent formula, which
also incorporates the effects of universe's inhomogeneity and anisotropy. When
the latter are secondary, the peculiar Raychaudhuri equation can be solved
analytically. Also, combining the resulting expression with data from recent
peculiar-velocity surveys, we estimate the relative deceleration/acceleration
rates of such bulk motions.

entanglement, but not vice versa, i.e., there are entangled states which do not
violate the CHSH inequality. Here we compare some standard entanglement
measures with violations of the CHSH inequality (as given by the Horodecki
measure) for two-qubit states generated by Monte Carlo simulations. We describe
states that have extremal entanglement according to the negativity,
concurrence, and relative entropy of entanglement for a given value of the CHSH
violation. We explicitly find these extremal states by applying the generalized
method of Lagrange multipliers based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. The
found minimal and maximal states define the range of entanglement accessible
for any two-qubit states that violate the CHSH inequality by the same amount.
We also find extremal states for the concurrence versus negativity by
considering only such states which do not violate the CHSH inequality.
Furthermore, we describe an experimentally efficient linear-optical method to
determine the highest Horodecki degree of the CHSH violation for arbitrary
mixed states of two polarization qubits. By assuming to have access
simultaneously to two copies of the states, our method requires only six
discrete measurement settings instead of nine settings, which are usually
considered.

discover a new weak-coupling fixed-point behavior that allows for ultraviolet
complete RG trajectories which can be connected with a conventional long-range
infrared behavior in the Higgs phase. This non-trivial ultraviolet behavior is
characterized by asymptotic freedom in all interaction couplings, but a quasi
conformal behavior in all mass-like parameters. The stable microscopic scalar
potential asymptotically approaches flatness in the ultraviolet, however, with
a non-vanishing minimum increasing inversely proportional to the asymptotically
free gauge coupling. This gives rise to nonperturbative -- though weak-coupling
-- threshold effects which induce ultraviolet stability along a line of fixed
points. Despite the weak-coupling properties, the system exhibits non-Gaussian
features which are distinctly different from its standard perturbative
counterpart: e.g., on a branch of the line of fixed points, we find linear
instead of quadratically running renormalization constants. Whereas the Fermi
constant and the top mass are naturally of the same order of magnitude, our
model generically allows for light Higgs boson masses. Realistic mass ratios
are related to particular RG trajectories with a ""walking"" mid-momentum regime.

structure is useful for analyzing termination: this information guarantees that
the depth of the data structure to which x points is greater than the depth of
the structure pointed to by x.fld, and allows bounding the number of iterations
of a loop which traverses the data structure on fld. In general, proving
termination needs acyclicity, unless program-specific or non-automated
reasoning is performed. However, recent work could prove that certain loops
terminate even without inferring acyclicity, because they traverse data
structures ""acyclically"". Consider a double-linked list: if it is possible to
demonstrate that every cycle involves both the ""next"" and the ""prev"" field,
then a traversal on ""next"" terminates since no cycle will be traversed
completely. This paper develops a static analysis inferring field-sensitive
reachability and cyclicity information, which is more general than existing
approaches. Propositional formulae are computed, which describe which fields
may or may not be traversed by paths in the heap. Consider a tree with edges
""left"" and ""right"" to the left and right sub-trees, and ""parent"" to the parent
node: termination of a loop traversing leaf-up cannot be guaranteed by
state-of-the-art analyses. Instead, propositional formulae computed by this
analysis indicate that cycles must traverse ""parent"" and at least one between
""left"" and ""right"": termination is guaranteed as no cycle is traversed
completely. This paper defines the necessary abstract domains and builds an
abstract semantics on them. A prototypical implementation provides the expected
result on relevant examples.

security of the KLJN scheme. They attempted to demonstrate this by introducing
a dissipation-free deterministic key exchange method with two batteries and two
switches. In the present paper, we first show that BR's scheme is unphysical
and that some elements of its assumptions violate basic protocols of secure
communication. All our analyses are based on a technically-unlimited Eve with
infinitely accurate and fast measurements limited only by the laws of physics
and statistics. For non-ideal situations and at active (invasive) attacks, the
uncertainly principle between measurement duration and statistical errors makes
it impossible for Eve to extract the key regardless of the accuracy or speed of
her measurements. To show that thermodynamics and noise are essential for the
security, we crack the BR system with 100% success via passive attacks, in ten
different ways, and demonstrate that the same cracking methods do not function
for the KLJN scheme that employs Johnson noise to provide security underpinned
by the Second Law of Thermodynamics. We also present a critical analysis of
some other claims by BR; for example, we prove that their equations for
describing zero security do not apply to the KLJN scheme. Finally we give
mathematical security proofs for each BR-attack against the KLJN scheme and
conclude that the information theoretic (unconditional) security of the KLJN

that its solution is still periodic if and only if the ratio between the

requires only a single asymptotic region, i.e. past infinity. The rules in
perturbation theory and the path integral measure are very different for in-in

approximation works completely different for a scalar in-in path integral.
Hence, in a cosmological background there are solutions, pseudo-instantons,
that allow tunneling between locally stable vacua even in infinite volume,

algorithms to automatically buy and sell ads in real-time; It uses per
impression context and targets the ads to specific people based on data about
them, and hence dramatically increases the effectiveness of display
advertising. In this paper, we provide an empirical analysis and measurement of
a production ad exchange. Using the data sampled from both demand and supply
side, we aim to provide first-hand insights into the emerging new impression
selling infrastructure and its bidding behaviours, and help identifying
research and design issues in such systems. From our study, we observed that
periodic patterns occur in various statistics including impressions, clicks,
bids, and conversion rates (both post-view and post-click), which suggest
time-dependent models would be appropriate for capturing the repeated patterns
in RTB. We also found that despite the claimed second price auction, the first
price payment in fact is accounted for 55.4% of total cost due to the
arrangement of the soft floor price. As such, we argue that the setting of soft
floor price in the current RTB systems puts advertisers in a less favourable
position. Furthermore, our analysis on the conversation rates shows that the
current bidding strategy is far less optimal, indicating the significant needs
for optimisation algorithms incorporating the facts such as the temporal
behaviours, the frequency and recency of the ad displays, which have not been

framework for interactive simulations in science and mathematics. A key purpose
of implicit scaffolding is to support a range of educational goals including
affect, process, and content. In particular, the use of implicit scaffolding
creates learning environments that are productive for content learning and are
able to simultaneously support the affective goals of student agency and
ownership over the learning process - goals that may not be addressed in more

  Physics, July 1st-5th 2013, Espoo (Finland)",,,,"physics.atom-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Absorption and emission spectra of multicharged-ion plasmas contain a huge
number of electron configurations and electric-dipolar lines, which can be
handled by global methods. However, some transition arrays consist only of a
small bunch of lines. For that reason, we developed the hybrid opacity code
SCO-RCG combining the (statistical) super-transition-array method and the
(detailed) fine-structure calculation (requiring the diagonalization of the
Hamiltonian matrix) of atomic structure. In order to decide whether a detailed
treatment of lines is necessary and to determine the validity of statistical
methods, the code involves criteria taking into account coalescence of lines
and porosity (localized absence of lines) in transition arrays. Data required
for the calculation of detailed transition arrays (Slater, spin-orbit and
dipolar integrals) are provided by the super-configuration code SCO, which
takes into account plasma screening effects on wavefunctions. Then, level
energies and lines are calculated by Cowan's code. Transition arrays for which
a detailed treatment is not required or impossible are described statistically,
by UTA (Unresolved Transition Arrays) and STA (Super Transition Arrays)
formalisms used in SCO. Recent developments are presented, such as the
extension of the PRTA (Partially Resolved Transition Array) model to the hybrid
approach, as well as comparisons with experimental spectra (laser or Z-pinch).

emission of LF from arbitrary reactions. However, the emission of LF is
important for many applications, such as cosmic-ray-induced single event
upsets, radiation protection, and cancer therapy with proton and heavy-ion
beams, to name just a few. The cascade-exciton model (CEM) and the Los Alamos
version of the quark-gluon string model (LAQGSM), as implemented in the
CEM03.03 and LAQGSM03.03 event generators used in the Los Alamos transport code
MCNP6, describe quite well the spectra of fragments with sizes up to 4He across
a broad range of target masses and incident energies. However, they do not
predict high-energy tails for LF heavier than 4He. The standard versions of CEM
and LAQGSM do not account for preequilibrium emission of LF larger than 4He.
The aim of our work is to extend the preequilibrium model to include such
processes. We do this by including the emission of fragments heavier than 4He
at the preequilibrium stage, and using an improved version of the Fermi
Break-up model, providing improved agreement with various experimental data.

missions has brought us gravity and magnetometry data of ever improving

should be well matched to the specific properties of the data. In particular,
inversion methods require specialized adaptation if the data are only locally
available, their quality varies spatially, or if we are interested in model
recovery only for a specific spatial region. Here, we present two approaches to
estimate potential fields on a spherical Earth, from gradient data collected at
satellite altitude. Our context is that of the estimation of the gravitational
or magnetic potential from vector-valued measurements. Both of our approaches
utilize spherical Slepian functions to produce an approximation of local data
at satellite altitude, which is subsequently transformed to the Earth's
spherical reference surface. The first approach is designed for
radial-component data only, and uses scalar Slepian functions. The second
approach uses all three components of the gradient data and incorporates a new
type of vectorial spherical Slepian functions which we introduce in this
chapter.

corrected for the Milky Way extinction) and with (g-r) colours larger than

classifications available in the literature. We found from our visual
classification that the majority of objects in our sample are edge-on spirals
(73%). Other spirals correspond to 13%, whereas elliptical galaxies comprise
only 11% of the objects. After comparing the morphological mix and the
distributions of H\alpha/H\beta and axial ratios of ERGs and objects in the red
sequence, we suggest that dust, more than stellar population effects, is the
driver of the red colours found in these extremely red galaxies.

generate coexisting sets of PDFs and $\alpha_S$ for $N_F=\{3,4,5,6\}$ at any
scale $\mu$, that are related analytically by the $\overline{\text{MS}}$
matching conditions. The H-VFNS resums the heavy quark contributions and
provides the freedom to choose the optimal $N_F$ for each particular data set.
Thus, we can fit selected HERA data in a FFNS framework, while retaining the
benefits of the VFNS to analyze LHC data at high scales. We illustrate how such

We show that the local effect of such gravitational fields on the particles

Lambda, Newtonian-type tidal deformations typical for spacetimes of algebraic
type D or II, longitudinal motion characteristic for spacetimes of type III,
and type N purely transverse effects of exact gravitational waves with D(D-3)/2
polarizations. We explicitly discuss the canonical forms of the geodesic
deviation motion in all algebraically special subtypes of the Kundt family for
which the optically privileged direction is a multiple Weyl aligned null
direction (WAND), namely D(a), D(b), D(c), D(d), III(a), III(b), IIIi, IIi,
II(a), II(b), II(c) and II(d). We demonstrate that the key invariant quantities
determining these algebraic types and subtypes also directly determine the
specific local motion of test particles, and are thus measurable by
gravitational detectors. As an example, we analyze an interesting class of type
N or II gravitational waves which propagate on backgrounds of type O or D,

Keplerian orbits around the radiating star, if gravity is Newtonian and the
Poynting-Robertson drag is neglected. Radiation drag may bring some particles
down to the stellar surface. On the other hand, general relativistic

radiation field at a certain distance from the star.

  Results: In Einstein's gravity, if the outburst is close to the Eddington
luminosity, all test particles orbiting outside an ""escape sphere"" will be
ejected from the system, while all others will be captured from their orbits
onto the surface of another sphere, which is well above the stellar surface,
and may even be outside the escape sphere, depending on the value of
luminosity. Radiation drag will bring all the captured particles to rest on
this ""Eddington capture sphere,"" where they will remain suspended in an
equilibrium state as long as the local flux of radiation does not change and
remains at the effective Eddington value.

obtained with a model that uses a two-layer gas envelope, in which the inner
region is denser than the outer one, together with a small, dense core. It is
possible to match J2 with a homogeneous envelope, but an envelope with a denser
inner region is needed to match both moments. The two-layer envelope also gives
good agreement with the global oscillation data for Jupiter. In Jupiter, the
boundary between the inner and outer envelopes occurs at 319 GPa, with an 8%
density increase. In Saturn, it occurs at 227 GPa, with a 69% density increase.
The differences between the two planets show that the need for a density
increase is not due to EOS errors. It is also shown that helium enrichment
cannot be the cause of the density increase. The phenomenon can be explained as
the result of enrichment of heavy elements from planetismals that were
dispersed and mixed with the gases during planet formation. This conclusion is
consistent with planetary formation models like that of Pollack, et al.

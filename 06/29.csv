array of chemical systems. However, the interpretation of those predictions is
often complicated by the complex wave function expansions used. Here we show
that an exceptionally simple algebraic construction allows for defining atomic
core and valence orbitals, polarized by the molecular environment, which can
exactly represent self-consistent field wave functions. This construction
provides an unbiased and direct connection between quantum chemistry and
empirical chemical concepts, and can be used, for example, to calculate the
nature of bonding in molecules, in chemical terms, from first principles.

probes of the star formation history of the Universe. In fact, both the GRB
rate and the galaxy luminosity density are connected to the underlying star
formation. Here, we combine a star formation model for the evolution of the
galaxy luminosity function from z=0 to z=10 with a metallicity-dependent
efficiency for GRB formation to simultaneously predict the comoving GRB rate.
Our model sheds light on the physical origin of the empirical relation often
assumed between GRB rate and luminosity density-derived star formation rate:
Rgrb(z) = \epsilon(z)*SFR_{obs}(z), with \epsilon(z) (1+z)^{1.2}. At z<4,
\epsilon(z) is dominated by the effects of metallicity evolution in the GRB
efficiency. Our best-fitting model only requires a moderate preference for
low-metallicity, that is a GRB rate per unit stellar mass about four times
higher for log(Z/Zsun)<-3 compared to log(Z/Zsun)>0. Models with total
suppression of GRB formation at log(Z/Zsun)>0 are disfavored. At z>4, most of
the star formation happens in low-metallicity hosts with nearly saturated
efficiency of GRB production per unit stellar mass. However at the same epoch,
galaxy surveys miss an increasing fraction of the predicted luminosity density
because of flux limits, driving an accelerated evolution of \epsilon(z)
compared to the empirical power-law fit from lower z. Our findings are
consistent with the non-detections of GRB hosts in ultradeep imaging at z>5,
and point toward current galaxy surveys at z>8 only observing the top 15-20 %
of the total luminosity density.

by solving a linear system. We draw connections between the support of the
recovered measure on a continuous domain and on a discretized grid. We show
that when the signal-to-noise level is large enough, the solution of the
discretized problem is supported on pairs of Diracs which are neighbors of the

(1968) and Peebles (1968),
a procedure was outlined to obtain the equation of evolution of the hydrogen
fraction without an explicit use of the radiative transfer equation. This
procedure is based, explicitly or implicitly, on the concept of escape
probability and, using the Sobolev approximation for this problem Sobolev
(1960), has extensively been used since then in developing refined
approximations.
  Aims: To derive in a simple, rigorous and general manner the above mentioned
procedure and to obtain exact analytical expressions for the spectral density
of radiation generated at one photon and two photon recombination transitions.
These expressions are used to estimate the implications of several interesting
effects.
  Methods: Some slight re-elaborations of basic principles of transport theory.
  Results: We have obtained the expressions searched for and used them in
several explicit computations. We have found that the relative change in the
electronic fraction due to the absorption by the two photon line, 1s->2s, of
photons that have escaped from the line 2p-> 1s is 0.67%, that is a result 12%
higher than the previous ones obtained using some approximations (Kholupenko &
Ivanchik 2006; Hirata 2008). The photons generated by the transition 2s->1s and
later absorbed by the same transition (in combination with a photon more
energetic than its original partner) imply a 0.05% maximum variation of the
electronic fraction. This problem has not been treated previously analytically,
although a numerical estimate have been recently carried out in Chluba & Thomas
2011.

weak coupling in SU(2) lattice gauge theory. Using Monte Carlo simulations with
the standard Wilson action, gauge-invariant SO(3)-Z2 monopoles, which are
strong-coupling lattice artifacts, have been seen to undergo a percolation
transition exactly at the phase transition previously seen using Coulomb-gauge
methods, with an infinite lattice critical point near $\beta = 3.2$. The theory
with both Z2 vortices and monopoles and SO(3)-Z2 monopoles eliminated is
simulated in the strong coupling ($\beta = 0$) limit on lattices up to $60^4$.
Here, as in the high-$\beta$ phase of the Wilson action theory, finite size
scaling shows it spontaneously breaks the remnant symmetry left over after
Coulomb gauge fixing. Such a symmetry breaking precludes the potential from
having a linear term. The monopole restriction appears to prevent the
transition to a confining phase at any $\beta$. Direct measurement of the
instantaneous Coulomb potential shows a Coulombic form with moderately running
coupling possibly approaching an infrared fixed point of $\alpha \sim 1.4$. The
Coulomb potential is measured to 50 lattice spacings and 2 fm. A short-distance
fit to the 2-loop perturbative potential is used to set the scale. High
precision at such long distances is made possible through the use of open
boundary conditions, which was previously found to cut random and systematic
errors of the Coulomb gauge fixing procedure dramatically. The Coulomb
potential agrees with the gauge-invariant interquark potential measured with
smeared Wilson loops on periodic lattices as far as the latter can be
practically measured with similar statistics data.

relevant to determine the global behavior of the society and thus it can be
used to enforce cooperation by targeting an adequate initial set of individuals
or to analyze global choice processes. Here we propose centrality measures that
can be used to analyze the relevance of the actors in process related to spread
of influence. In [39] it was considered a multiagent system in which the agents
are eager to perform a collective task depending on the perception of the
willingness to perform the task of other individuals. The setting is modeled
using a notion of simple games called influence games. Those games are defined
on graphs were the nodes are labeled by their influence threshold and the
spread of influence between its nodes is used to determine whether a coalition
is winning or not. Influence games provide tools to measure the importance of
the actors of a social network by means of classic power indices and provide a
framework to consider new centrality criteria. In this paper we consider two of
the most classical power indices, i.e., Banzhaf and Shapley-Shubik indices, as
centrality measures for social networks in influence games. Although there is
some work related to specific scenarios of game-theoretic networks, here we use
such indices as centrality measures in any social network where the spread of
influence phenomenon can be applied. Further, we define new centrality measures
such as satisfaction and effort that, as far as we know, have not been
considered so far. We also perform a comparison of the proposed measures with
other three classic centrality measures, degree, closeness and betweenness,
considering three social networks. We show that in some cases our measurements
provide centrality hierarchies similar to those of other measures, while in
other cases provide different hierarchies.

that there was a prior eruption 24 years earlier. Unfortunately, the chart in

whether T CrB did indeed have an eruption in 1842. To resolve this, I have
searched the various archives with Herschel material, and have found his
original correspondence. In one letter from 1866 to William Huggins, Herschel
enclosed his own copy of his original observations, and with this all the

the same position as a steady background star (BD+25{\deg}3020, V=7.06, G8V)

to explore some aspects of cluster galaxy evolution and the dynamical state of

183 clusters extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey using a list of NoSOCS
and CIRS targets. First, we classified the clusters into two categories,
Gaussian and non-Gaussian, according to their velocity distribution
measurements, which we used as an indicator of their dynamical state. We then
used objective criteria to split up galaxies according to their luminosities,
colors, and photometric mean stellar age. This information was then used to
evaluate how galaxies evolve in their host clusters. Meaningful color
gradients, i.e., the fraction of red galaxies as a function of radius from the
center, are observed for both the Gaussian velocity distribution and the
non-Gaussian velocity distribution cluster subsamples, which suggests that
member galaxy colors change on a shorter timescale than the time needed for the
cluster to reach dynamical equilibrium. We also found that larger portions of
fainter red galaxies are found, on average, in smaller radii. The luminosity
function in Gaussian clusters has a brighter characteristic absolute magnitude
and a steeper faint-end slope than it does in the non-Gaussian velocity
distribution clusters. Our findings suggest that cluster galaxies experience
intense color evolution before virialization, while the formation of faint
galaxies through dynamical interactions probably takes place on a longer
timescale, possibly longer than the virialization time.

largely studied in the last years to probe the mass assembly of the most
massive objects in the Universe. In this paper, we focus on the mass-size
relation of quiescent massive ETGs (Mstar/Msol > 3*10^10) living in massive
clusters (M200 ~ 10^14 Mstar) at 0.8< z <1.5, as compared to those living in
the field at the same epoch. Our sample contains ~ 400 ETGs in clusters and the
same number in the field. Therefore, our sample is approximately an order of
magnitude larger than previous studies in the same redshift range for galaxy
clusters. We find that ETGs living in clusters are between ~30-50% larger than
galaxies with the same stellar mass residing in the field. We parametrize the
size using the mass-normalized size, gamma=Re/Mstar^0.57. The gamma
distributions in both environments peak at the same position but the
distributions in clusters are more skewed towards larger sizes. Since this size
difference is not observed in the local Universe, the size evolution at fixed
stellar mass from z~1.5 of cluster galaxies is less steep ((1+z)-0.53pm0.04)
than the evolution of field galaxies ((1+z)-0.92pm0.04).
  The size difference seems to be essentially driven by the galaxies residing
in the clusters cores (R<0.5*R200). If part of the size evolution is due to
mergers, the difference we see between cluster and field galaxies could be due
to higher merger rates in clusters at higher redshift, probably during the
formation phase of the clusters when velocity dispersions are lower. We cannot
exclude however that the difference is driven by newly quenched galaxies which
are quenched more efficiently in clusters. The implications of these results
for the hierarchical growth of ETGs will be discussed in a companion paper.

form of stellar streams for all five stellar haloes we have analysed. These
streams can be easily identified in velocity space, as well as in spaces of
pseudo-conserved quantities such as E vs. Lz. In our best-resolved local
volumes, the number of identified streams ranges from ~ 300 to 600, in very
good agreement with previous analytical predictions, even in the presence of
chaotic mixing. The fraction of particles linked to (massive) stellar streams
in these volumes can be as large as 84%. The number of identified streams is
found to decrease as a power-law with galactocentric radius. We show that the
strongest limitation to the quantification of substructure in our

accretion on to the hole in approximately 70% of all cases. Here we examine the

velocities in massive clusters. In haloes above ~ 10^14 Msun, the brightest
satellite galaxies are slightly cooler compared to the dark matter, while
fainter satellites are hotter. Within the virial radius of a cluster, the mean
velocity dispersion based on the 100 brightest galaxies is a factor of 1.065
+/- 0.005 (stat) +/- 0.027 (sys) higher than that of the dark matter
(corresponding to a ~10-15 per cent bias in the dynamical mass estimate) while
that based on only the five brightest galaxies is 0.868 +/- 0.039 (stat) +/-
0.035 (sys). These trends are approximately independent of redshift. The
velocity structure is sensitive to the modelling of galaxies in clusters,
indicative of the complex interplay of tidal stripping, dynamical friction, and
merging. Velocity dispersions derived from instantaneous subhalo properties are
larger than those employing either peak subhalo properties or hydrodynamical
galaxy tracers. The latter two methods are consistent, implying that stacked
spectroscopic analysis of cluster samples should, after correction for
projection, show a trend towards slightly higher velocities when fainter
galaxies are included, with an unbiased measure of dark matter velocity
dispersion coming from approximately 30 galaxies per cluster. We show evidence
that the velocity distribution function of bright galaxies near the cluster
centre has a low-velocity tail due to strong dynamical friction.

high/soft state of X-ray binaries show little variability in the range 0.01
L_Edd < L < 0.5 L_Edd, implying that these discs in nature are in fact quite
stable. In an attempt to reconcile this conflict, we investigate one-zone disc
models including turbulent and convective modes of vertical energy transport.
We find both mixing mechanisms to have a stabilizing effect, leading to an
increase in the L threshold up to which the disc is thermally stable. In the
case of stellar mass black hole systems, convection alone leads to only a minor
increase in this threshold, up to ~5 per cent of Eddington. However turbulent
mixing has a much greater effect -- the threshold rises up to ~20 per cent
Eddington under reasonable assumptions. In optimistic models with
superefficient turbulent mixing, we even find solutions that are completely
thermally stable for all accretion rates. Similar results are obtained for
supermassive black holes, except that all critical accretion rates are a factor

those found in the near-Earth solar wind, though most of our results are more
broadly applicable. An important control parameter is the size of the particle
mean free path lambda_{mfp} relative to the scale of the turbulent fluctuations
L. For small scattering rates, particles interact quasi-resonantly with
turbulent fluctuations in magnetic field strength. Scattering increases the
long-term efficiency of this resonant heating by factors of a few-10, but the
distribution function does not develop a significant non-thermal power-law
tail. For higher scattering rates, the interaction between particles and
turbulent fluctuations becomes non-resonant, governed by particles heating and
cooling adiabatically as they encounter turbulent density fluctuations. Rapid
pitch-angle scattering can produce a power-law tail in the proton distribution
function but this requires fine-tuning of parameters. Moreover, in the
near-Earth solar wind, a significant power-law tail cannot develop by this
mechanism because the particle acceleration timescales are longer than the
adiabatic cooling timescale set by the expansion of the solar wind. Our results
thus imply that MHD-scale turbulent fluctuations are unlikely to be the origin
of the v^{-5} tail in the proton distribution function observed in the solar
wind.

order-isomorphic to q and the blue ones to r. A 'permutation class' is a set of
permutations closed under taking subpermutations. A permutation class C is
'splittable' if it has two proper subclasses A and B such that every element of
C can be obtained by merging an element of A with an element of B.
  Several recent papers use splittability as a tool in deriving enumerative
results for specific permutation classes. The goal of this paper is to study
splittability systematically. As our main results, we show that if q is a
sum-decomposable permutation of order at least four, then the class Av(q) of
all q-avoiding permutations is splittable, while if q is a simple permutation,
then Av(q) is unsplittable.
  We also show that there is a close connection between splittings of certain
permutation classes and colorings of circle graphs of bounded clique size.
Indeed, our splittability results can be interpreted as a generalization of a
theorem of Gy\'arf\'as stating that circle graphs of bounded clique size have
bounded chromatic number.

we prove the existence of a minimiser of the wave energy $\mathcal H$ subject
to the constraint $\mathcal I=2\mu$, where $\mathcal I$ is the wave momentum
and $0< \mu \ll 1$. Since $\mathcal H$ and $\mathcal I$ are both conserved

suitably defined energy space over their interval of existence.
  In the applied mathematics literature solitary water waves of the present
kind are described by solutions of a Korteweg-deVries equation (for strong
surface tension) or a nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equation (for weak surface

trapping behaviour by means of computer simulations of a two-dimensional system
of self-propelled rods. A chevron-shaped obstacle is dragged through the active
suspension with a constant speed $v$ and acts as a trapping ""net"". Three
trapping states can be identified corresponding to no trapping, partial
trapping and complete trapping and their relative stability is studied as a
function of the apex angle of the wedge, the swimmer density and the drag speed
$v$. When the net is dragged along the inner wedge, complete trapping is
facilitated and a partially trapped state changes into a complete trapping
state if the drag speed exceeds a certain value. Reversing the drag direction
leads to a reentrant transition from no trapping, complete trapping, back to no
trapping upon increasing the drag speed along the outer wedge contour. The
transition to complete trapping is marked by a templated self-assembly of rods
forming polar smectic structures anchored onto the inner contour of the wedge.
Our predictions can be verified in experiments of artificial or microbial

corresponding to a wide range of large-scale networks, from communication and
road networks to various forms of social networks, we explore a little-studied
geometric characteristic of real-life networks, namely their hyperbolicity. In
smooth geometry, hyperbolicity captures the notion of negative curvature;
within the more abstract context of metric spaces, it can be generalized as
d-hyperbolicity. This generalized definition can be applied to graphs, which we
explore in this report. We provide strong evidence that communication and
social networks exhibit this fundamental property, and through extensive
computations we quantify the degree of hyperbolicity of each network in
comparison to its diameter. By contrast, and as evidence of the validity of the
methodology, applying the same methods to the road networks shows that they are
not hyperbolic, which is as expected. Finally, we present practical
computational means for detection of hyperbolicity and show how the test itself
may be scaled to much larger graphs than those we examined via renormalization
group methodology. Using well-understood mechanisms, we provide evidence
through synthetically generated graphs that hyperbolicity is preserved and
indeed amplified by renormalization. This allows us to detect hyperbolicity in
large networks efficiently, through much smaller renormalized versions. These
observations indicate that d-hyperbolicity is a common feature of large-scale
networks. We propose that d-hyperbolicity in conjunction with other local
characteristics of networks, such as the degree distribution and clustering
coefficients, provide a more complete unifying picture of networks, and helps
classify in a parsimonious way what is otherwise a bewildering and complex
array of features and characteristics specific to each natural and man-made
network.

high-dimensional regime, with limited memory. Here, $p$-dimensional samples are
presented sequentially, and the goal is to produce the $k$-dimensional subspace
that best approximates these points. Standard algorithms require $O(p^2)$
memory; meanwhile no algorithm can do better than $O(kp)$ memory, since this is
what the output itself requires. Memory (or storage) complexity is most
meaningful when understood in the context of computational and sample
complexity. Sample complexity for high-dimensional PCA is typically studied in
the setting of the {\em spiked covariance model}, where $p$-dimensional points
are generated from a population covariance equal to the identity (white noise)
plus a low-dimensional perturbation (the spike) which is the signal to be
recovered. It is now well-understood that the spike can be recovered when the
number of samples, $n$, scales proportionally with the dimension, $p$. Yet, all
algorithms that provably achieve this, have memory complexity $O(p^2)$.
Meanwhile, algorithms with memory-complexity $O(kp)$ do not have provable
bounds on sample complexity comparable to $p$. We present an algorithm that
achieves both: it uses $O(kp)$ memory (meaning storage of any kind) and is able
to compute the $k$-dimensional spike with $O(p \log p)$ sample-complexity --
the first algorithm of its kind. While our theoretical analysis focuses on the

extremal horizons and develop a model-independent approach and analyze the
conditions for the force to preserve or kill the effect, using the frames
attached both to observers orbiting the black hole and to ones crossing the

rather general assumptions, the BSW effect survives. For equatorial motion it
is only required that in the proper frame the radial component of the force be
finite, while the azimuthal one tend to zero not too slowly. If the latter
condition is violated, we evaluate $E_{c.m.}$, which becomes indeed restricted

substantial sequence homogeneity challenges available assembly strategies, and
as a result, centromeric regions are omitted from ongoing genomic studies. To
address this problem, we present a locally ordered assembly across two haploid

representation of 3.83 Mb of centromeric DNA within an individual genome. To
further expand the utility of each centromeric reference sequence, we evaluate

As satellite DNAs evolve in a concerted manner, we use these centromeric

from distinct human populations. In doing so, we identify two ancient satellite
array variants in both X and Y centromeres as determined by array length and
sequence composition. This study provides an initial linear representation and

establishes a foundation to extend genomic characterization to these sites as

converting the original PNG image into k-Modulus Method (k-MM). Practically,
taking k equals to ten, and then the pixels in the constructed image will be
integers divisible by ten. Since PNG uses Lempel-Ziv compression algorithm,
then the ability to reduce file size will increase according to the repetition

problems, which demands deeper theoretical underpinnings of the graph

light of their continuum counterparts, provide some background, prove the first
results connecting them, illustrate these processes with examples and identify
open questions for future study. We derive a graph curvature from the graph cut
function, the natural graph counterpart of total variation (perimeter). This
derivation and the resulting curvature definition differ from those in earlier
literature, where the continuum mean curvature is simply discretized, and bears
many similarities to the continuum nonlocal curvature or nonlocal means
formulation. This new graph curvature is not only relevant for graph MBO
dynamics, but also appears in the variational formulation of a discrete time
graph mean curvature flow. We prove estimates showing that the dynamics are
trivial for both MBO and AC evolutions if the parameters (the time-step and
diffuse interface scale, respectively) are sufficiently small (a phenomenon
known as ""freezing"" or ""pinning"") and also that the dynamics for MBO are
nontrivial if the time step is large enough. These bounds are in terms of graph
quantities such as the spectrum of the graph Laplacian and the graph curvature.
Adapting a Lyapunov functional for the continuum MBO scheme to graphs, we prove
that the graph MBO scheme converges to a stationary state in a finite number of
iterations. Variations on this scheme have recently become popular in the
literature as ways to minimize (continuum) nonlocal total variation.

sensor networks in adversarial environments, ensuring secure routing becomes of
critical importance for the success of such deployments. The problem of
designing a secure routing protocol for ad hoc networks has been already
addressed, yet, there exists no complete solution that meets the specific
requirements of sensor networks, where nodes are extremely constrained in terms
of both power and computational resources. Thus, we propose a new protocol that
is not built solely around security but also has efficiency and simplicity
among its main goals. We propose the Secure Ad Hoc Efficient Routing protocol
(SAHER) which employs a two-tier architecture based on node clustering. Also,
we combine mechanisms like localscale geographic routing, per-node reputation
tables, credit based alternate route enforcement and cumulative authentication.
Using these techniques we examine ways to efficiently defend against the two
most common network layer attacks: selective packet dropping and message
flooding. Further, we consider join/leave operations which have not yet been
studied in sufficient depth for sensor networks from a security standpoint. We
provide a description of the protocol along with comprehensive experimental
evaluation under different node distributions, different proportions of
non-malicious vs. malicious nodes and different types of activity that
malicious nodes could exhibit.

point in the intersection of convex sets. This problem is typically solved by
the method of alternating projections. To accelerate the convergence, the idea
of using Quadratic Programming (QP) to project a point onto the intersection of
halfspaces generated by the projection process was discussed in earlier papers.
This paper looks at how one can integrate projection algorithms together with
an active set QP algorithm. As a byproduct of our analysis, we show how to
accelerate an SIP algorithm involving box constraints, and how to extend a
version of the Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART) while preserving finite
convergence. Lastly, the warmstart property of active set QP algorithms is a
valuable property for the problem of projecting onto the intersection of convex
sets.

spatial correlations tended to increase correlations in the retinal response.
Responding to more correlated stimuli, ganglion cells had faster temporal

scene generator, a renderer based on graphics software, a stochastic likelihood
model linking the renderer's output and the data, and latent variables that
adjust the fidelity of the renderer and the tolerance of the likelihood model.
Representations and algorithms from computer graphics, originally designed to
produce high-quality images, are instead used as the deterministic backbone for
highly approximate and stochastic generative models. This formulation combines
probabilistic programming, computer graphics, and approximate Bayesian
computation, and depends only on general-purpose, automatic inference
techniques. We describe two applications: reading sequences of degraded and
adversarially obscured alphanumeric characters, and inferring 3D road models

inversions based on principal component analysis (PCA) of Stokes profiles. This
technique involves the indexing of the database models based on the sign of the
projections (PCA coefficients) of the first few relevant orders of principal
components of the four Stokes parameters. In this way, each model in the
database can be attributed a distinctive binary number of $2^{4n}$ bits, where
$n$ is the number of PCA orders used for the indexing. Each of these binary
numbers (indexes) identifies a group of ""compatible"" models for the inversion
of a given set of observed Stokes profiles sharing the same index. The complete
set of the binary numbers so constructed evidently determines a partition of
the database. The search of the database for the PCA inversion of
spectro-polarimetric data can profit greatly from this indexing. In practical
cases it becomes possible to approach the ideal acceleration factor of $2^{4n}$
as compared to the systematic search of a non-indexed database for a
traditional PCA inversion. This indexing method relies on the existence of a
physical meaning in the sign of the PCA coefficients of a model. For this
reason, the presence of model ambiguities and of spectro-polarimetric noise in
the observations limits in practice the number $n$ of relevant PCA orders that
can be used for the indexing.

terms of orthogonal polynomials and differential equations are derived for the

differential equations when the original system has Hamiltonian structure, has
multiple time scales, or displays chaotic dynamics. In particular, we prove
that the differential equations for the expansion coefficients in generalized
polynomial chaos expansions of Hamiltonian systems retain the Hamiltonian
structure relative to the ensemble average Hamiltonian. We connect this with
the volume-preserving property of Hamiltonian flows to show that, for an
oscillator with uncertain frequency, a finite expansion must fail at long
times, regardless of the order of the expansion. Also, using a two-time scale
forced nonlinear oscillator, we show that a polynomial chaos expansion of the
time-averaged equations captures uncertainty in the slow evolution of the
Poincar\'e section of the system and that, as the time scale separation
increases, the computational advantage of this procedure increases. Finally,
using the forced Duffing oscillator as an example, we demonstrate that when the
original dynamical system displays chaotic dynamics, the resulting dynamical
system from polynomial chaos also displays chaotic dynamics, limiting its
applicability.

demonstrated experimentally with a Bose-Einstein condensate to explore this

In particular, the observed asymmetry in the dependence of the relative

scalar sector and an Abelian gauge symmetry in the vector sector. These
symmetries, together with the requirement that the equations of motion contain
at most two space-time derivatives, only allow for a small number of operators
in the Lagrangian for the gravitational fields. We investigate the role of
gravitational vector fields for two broad classes of phenomena that
characterize modified gravity scenarios. The first is self-acceleration: we
analyze in general terms the behavior of vector fluctuations around
self-accelerating solutions, and show that vanishing kinetic terms of vector
fluctuations lead to instabilities on cosmological backgrounds. The second
phenomenon is the screening of long range fifth forces by means of Vainshtein
mechanism. We show that if gravitational vector fields are appropriately
coupled to a spherically symmetric source, they can play an important role for
defining the features of the background solution and the scale of the
Vainshtein radius. Our general results can be applied to any concrete model of

at a constant rate at large scales. Energy is then transferred to smaller
scales by an intermittent process that has been the focus of a vast literature.
However, the energy input at large scales is not constant in most real
turbulent flows. We explore the signatures of these fluctuations of large scale
energy input on small scale turbulence statistics. Measurements were made in a
flow between oscillating grids, with Re up to 271, in which temporal variations
in the large scale energy input can be introduced by modulating the oscillating
grid frequency. We find that the Kolmogorov constant for second order
longitudinal structure functions depends on the magnitude of the fluctuations
in the large scale energy input. We can quantitatively predict the measured
change with a model based on Kolmogorov's refined similarity theory. The
effects of fluctuations of the energy input can also be observed using
structure functions conditioned on the instantaneous large scale velocity. A
linear parameterization using the curvature of the iconditional structure
functions provides a fairly good match with the measured changes in the
Kolmogorov constant. Conditional structure functions are found to provide a
more sensitive measure of the presence of fluctuations in the large scale
energy input than inertial range scaling coefficients.

model-independent information on the averaged electron (anti-) neutrino mass,
which is formed by the incoherent sum of the neutrino mass eigenstates
contributing to the electron neutrino. We first review the kinematics of
$\beta$-decay and the determination of the neutrino mass, before giving a brief
overview of past neutrino mass measurements (SN1987a-ToF studies, Mainz and
Troitsk experiments for $^3$H, cryo-bolometers for $^{187}$Re). We then
describe the Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino (KATRIN) experiment which is currently
under construction at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. The large-scale setup
will use the MAC-E-Filter principle pioneered earlier to push the sensitivity
down to a value of 200 meV(90% C.L.). KATRIN faces many technological
challenges that have to be resolved with regard to source intensity and
stability, as well as precision energy analysis and low background rate close
to the kinematic endpoint of tritium $\beta$-decay at 18.6 keV. We then review
new experimental approaches such as the MARE, ECHO and Project8 experiments,
which offer the promise to perform an independent measurement of the neutrino
mass in the sub-eV region. This variety of methods and the novel technologies
developed in all present and future experiments demonstrate the great potential
of direct neutrino mass experiments in providing vital information on the

traditional meanings given by Heyting categories, the topos-theoretic
interpretation, and Kripke models. The feature which justifies the introduction
of this novel semantics is the fact that it is 'point-free', i.e., there is no
universe whose elements are used to interpret the logical terms. In other
words, terms do not denote individuals of some collection but, instead, they
denote the 'glue' which keeps together the interpretations of statements,
similarly to what happens in formal topology. Since the proposed semantics can
be trivially extended to all the first-order logical theories based on the
intuitionistic system (and, with some care, to minimal systems as well), the
semantics covers also all the predicative theories, even if some peculiar
aspects of these theories should be remarked.

the 2007 National R&D Plan for 23 research fields. We analyze peers' ratings
for 2333 applications. We also gathered principal investigators' research
output and impact and studied the differences between accepted and rejected
applications. We used the Web of Science database and focused on the 2002-2006
period. First, we analyzed the distribution of granted and rejected proposals
considering a given set of bibliometric indicators to test if there are
significant differences. Then, we applied a multiple logistic regression
analysis to determine if bibliometric indicators can explain by themselves the
concession of grant proposals. 63.4% of the applications were funded.
Bibliometric indicators for accepted proposals showed a better previous
performance than for those rejected; however the correlation between peer
review and bibliometric indicators is very heterogeneous among most areas. The
logistic regression analysis showed that the main bibliometric indicators that
explain the granting of research proposals in most cases are the output (number
of published articles) and the number of papers published in journals that
belong to the first quartile ranking of the Journal Citations Report.
Bibliometric indicators predict the concession of grant proposals at least as
well as peer ratings. Social Sciences and Education are the only areas where no
relation was found, although this may be due to the limitations of the Web of
Science's coverage. These findings encourage the use of bibliometric indicators
as a complement to peer review in most of the analyzed areas.

$f$ is a half integer weight modular form. This $L$-function has analytic
continuation and functional equation, but no Euler product. Due to the lack of
an Euler product, one does not expect a Riemann hypothesis for half integer
weight modular forms. Nevertheless one may speculate a Lindelof-type
hypothesis, and this current subconvexity result is an indication towards its
truth.

employing the notion of the entropy of the motif distribution and describe it

non-convex. We conjecture that this phenomenon is the origin of the motifs'

demonstrate an all-optically created transient metamaterial that permits to

many applications. Due to the complex nature, direct numerical simulations on
the fine grid are prohibitively expensive. It is therefore important to develop
efficient and accurate methods that allow the use of coarse grids. In this
paper, we present a multiscale finite element method for wave propagation on a
coarse grid. The proposed method is based on the Generalized Multiscale Finite
Element Method (GMsFEM). To construct multiscale basis functions, we start with
two snapshot spaces in each coarse-grid block where one represents the degrees
of freedom on the boundary and the other represents the degrees of freedom in
the interior. We use local spectral problems to identify important modes in
each snapshot space. These local spectral problems are different from each
other and their formulations are based on the analysis. To our best knowledge,
this is the first time where multiple snapshot spaces and multiple spectral
problems are used and necessary for efficient computations. Using the dominant
modes from local spectral problems, multiscale basis functions are constructed
to represent the solution space locally within each coarse block. These
multiscale basis functions are coupled via the symmetric interior penalty
discontinuous Galerkin method which provides a block diagonal mass matrix, and,
consequently, results in fast computations in an explicit time discretiza-
tion. Our methods' stability and spectral convergence are rigorously analyzed.
Numerical examples are presented to show our methods' performance. We also test
oversampling strategies. In particular, we discuss how the modes from different
snapshot spaces can affect the proposed methods' accuracy.

impose a bias towards selecting loops that appear not to be expanding seen

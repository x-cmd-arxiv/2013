  robust optimization, stochastic programming, moment matching, column
  generation, cutting surface methods, cutting plane methods, moment problem",,,,"math.OC q-fin.CP q-fin.PM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present and analyze a central cutting surface algorithm for general
semi-infinite convex optimization problems, and use it to develop a novel
algorithm for distributionally robust optimization problems in which the
uncertainty set consists of probability distributions with given bounds on
their moments. Moments of arbitrary order, as well as non-polynomial moments
can be included in the formulation. We show that this gives rise to a hierarchy
of optimization problems with decreasing levels of risk-aversion, with classic
robust optimization at one end of the spectrum, and stochastic programming at
the other. Although our primary motivation is to solve distributionally robust
optimization problems with moment uncertainty, the cutting surface method for
general semi-infinite convex programs is also of independent interest. The
proposed method is applicable to problems with non-differentiable semi-infinite
constraints indexed by an infinite-dimensional index set. Examples comparing
the cutting surface algorithm to the central cutting plane algorithm of
Kortanek and No demonstrate the potential of our algorithm even in the solution
of traditional semi-infinite convex programming problems whose constraints are
differentiable and are indexed by an index set of low dimension. After the rate
of convergence analysis of the cutting surface algorithm, we extend the
authors' moment matching scenario generation algorithm to a probabilistic
algorithm that finds optimal probability distributions subject to moment
constraints. The combination of this distribution optimization method and the
central cutting surface algorithm yields a solution to a family of
distributionally robust optimization problems that are considerably more
general than the ones proposed to date.

deliver the vibrational integrated band intensities of various large, typical

distribution of weak modes from which emerge the fingerprints. The 6 to 18-mu
region is interspersed with a great many weak lines, to which the plateaus are
assigned. Similarly, the far IR spectrum is ascribed to the phonon (skeletal)
spectrum which is readily identified beyond 18 mu. The absorptivities and
absorption cross-sections per interstellar H atom deduced from these spectra
are comparable with those of laboratory dust analogs and astronomical
measurements, respectively. Moreover, the 5-35 mu spectra of two typical

molecules containing functional groups which carry the 21- and 30-mu bands, and
molecules devoid of these but carrying strong phonon spectra. These results may

meaning that their qualitative topological structure cannot be altered by
random removal of even a large proportion of nodes. By contrast, it has been
argued in the science literature that such networks are highly vulnerable to a
targeted attack, and removing a small number of key nodes in the network will
dramatically change the topological structure. Here we analyse a class of
preferential attachment networks in the robust regime and prove four main
results supporting this claim: After removal of an arbitrarily small proportion
epsilon>0 of the oldest nodes (1) the asymptotic degree distribution has
exponential instead of power law tails; (2) the largest degree in the network
drops from being of the order of a power of the network size n to being just
logarithmic in n; (3) the typical distances in the network increase from order
log log n to order log n; and (4) the network becomes vulnerable to random
removal of nodes. Importantly, all our results explicitly quantify the
dependence on the proportion epsilon of removed vertices. For example, we show
that the critical proportion of nodes that have to be retained for survival of
the giant component undergoes a steep increase as epsilon moves away from zero,
and a comparison of this result with similar ones for other networks reveals
the existence of two different universality classes of robust network models.
The key technique in our proofs is a local approximation of the network by a
branching random walk with two killing boundaries, and an understanding of the
particle genealogies in this process, which enters into estimates for the
spectral radius of an associated operator.

determine in a self-consistent way the abundances of eleven elements with
well-defined lines in the UV, namely those of C, N, O, F, Mg, Si, P, S, Ar, Fe,
and Ni. The derived abundances range from about solar to 1/10 solar. We find
that the overall quality of the derived spectral fits is very satisfying. Our
spectral analysis can be used to constrain rather tigthly the effective
temperature of Bd+28 to a value of teff = 82,000 +/- 5000 K. We also estimate
conservatively that its surface gravity falls in the range log g = 6.2
-0.1/+0.3. Assuming that the Hipparcos measurement for Bd+28 is fully reliable
and that our model atmospheres are reasonably realistic, we can reconcile our
spectroscopic constraints with the available parallax measurement only if the
mass of Bd+28 is significantly less than the canonical value of 0.5 msun for a
representative post-EHB star.

is presented, for the identification and quantitative description of clusters
formed by N objects in three dimensional space. The method consists of finding
a path, as short as possible, connecting the objects, and then tracking down
the size s, of a subgroup i-n, i-n+1, ..., i+n, of 2n+1 < N particles for i
varying from n+1 to N-n. Clusters are located where local minima of s(i) occur
whereas local maxima serve as delimiters partitioning the path in subsets
containing the clusters. Minimal post-processing allows for the removal of
outliers on the basis of user-defined criteria and the identification of
clearly defined clusters. The advantage of the method is that it requires no
predetermined input or criteria of ""clusterness"" such as number of objects or
size of aggregates. Among the numerous possible applications of the method,
results are herein reported, from Molecular Dynamics simulations of a binary
mixture of Lennard-Jones fluids and of a model polymeric system with a gas-like
substance dispersed in it. The method is shown to allow the extraction of
meaningful quantitative information regarding the tendency of molecules to
cluster or de-cluster and the dynamics of the clustering processes.

population size can be a misleading measure of ecosystem stability. By
analyzing the oscillatory producer parasite dynamics for over ~100 generations

short-hard Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) with an emission from the keV up to the GeV
energy range. Within the Fireshell model, we interpret the faint precursor in
the light curve as the emission at the transparency of the expanding e+e-
plasma: the Proper-GRB (P-GRB). From the observed isotropic energy we assume a
total energy Ee+e-=(1.10+-0.06)*10^53 erg and derive a Baryon load
B=(1.45+-0.28)*10^(-3) and a Lorentz factor at transparency
Gamma=(6.7+-1.6)*10^2. The main emission 0.4 s after the initial spike is
interpreted as the extended afterglow, due to the interaction of the
ultrarelativistic baryons with the CircumBurst Medium (CBM). Using the
condition of fully radiative regime, we infer a CBM average spherically
symmetric density of nCBM=(1.85+-0.14)10^3 cm^(-3), one of the highest found in
the Fireshell model. The value of the filling factor,
1.5*10^(-10)<R<3.8*10^(-8), leads to the estimate of filaments with densities
nfil=nCBM/R=(10^6 - 10^14) cm^(-3). The sub-MeV and the MeV emissions are well
reproduced. When compared to the canonical GRBs with nCBM=1 cm^(-3) and to the
disguised short GRBs with nCBM=10^(-3) cm^(-3), the case of GRB 090510 leads to
the existence of a new family of bursts exploding in an over-dense galactic
region with hn nCBM=10^3 cm^(-3). The joint effect of the high Lorentz factor
and the high density compresses in time and ""inflates"" in intensity the
extended afterglow, making it appear as a short burst, which we here define as
""disguised short GRB by excess"". The determination of the above parameters
values may represent an important step towards the explanation of the GeV

sources against external catalogs and find 189 unidentified synchrotron sources
and 189 unidentified dusty sources. The dusty sources without counterparts are
good candidates for high-redshift, strongly lensed submillimeter galaxies. We
derive number counts for each population from 1 Jy down to roughly 9, 5, and 11

models and find that none of the models we consider for either population

a scheduler, one user may learn the other user's behavior from patterns of
service timings. We measure the information leakage of the resulting timing
side channel in schedulers serving a legitimate user and a malicious attacker,
using a privacy metric defined as the Shannon equivocation of the user's job
density. We show that the commonly used first-come-first-serve (FCFS) scheduler
provides no privacy as the attacker is able to to learn the user's job pattern
completely. Furthermore, we introduce an scheduling policy,
accumulate-and-serve scheduler, which services jobs from the user and attacker
in batches after buffering them. The information leakage in this scheduler is
mitigated at the price of service delays, and the maximum privacy is achievable
when large delays are added.

of quantum effects toward solving real-world problems. But two major obstacles
have stood in the way of widespread applications: low secure key generation
rates and short achievable operating distances. In this paper, a new physical
mechanism for dealing with the first of these problems is proposed: interplay
between different degrees of freedom in a hyperentangled system (parametric
down conversion) is used to increase the Hilbert space dimension available for
key generation while maintaining security. Polarization-based Bell tests
provide security checking, while orbital angular momentum (OAM) and total
angular momentum (TAM) provide higher key generation rate. Whether to measure
TAM or OAM is decided randomly on each trial. The concurrent non-commutativity
of TAM with OAM and polarization provides the physical basis for quantum
security. TAM measurements link polarization to OAM, so that if the legitimate
participants measure OAM while the eavesdropper measures TAM (or vice-versa),
then polarization entanglement is lost, revealing the eavesdropper. In contrast
to other OAM-based QKD methods, complex active switching between OAM bases is
not required; instead, passive switching by beam splitters combined with much
simpler active switching between polarization bases makes implementation at
high OAM more practical.

special case that we study in detail, the random projections are divided into
non-overlapping blocks; each consisting of only a small portion of the original
data. Within each block we select the projection yielding the smallest

according to new maximal-contrast voting scheme to determine the final selected
set. Our theoretical results illuminate the effect on performance of increasing
the number of non-overlapping blocks. Moreover, we demonstrate that statistical
optimality is retained along with the computational speedup. The proposed
method achieves minimax rates for approximate recovery over all estimators
using the full set of samples. Furthermore, our theoretical results allow the
number of subsamples to grow with the subsample size and do not require

line (BAL) quasars, PG 1004+130 (radio loud) and PG 1700+518 (radio quiet).
Many BAL quasars appear X-ray weak, probably due to absorption by the shielding
gas between the nucleus and the accretion-disk wind. The two targets are among
the optically brightest BAL quasars, yet they are known to be significantly
X-ray weak at rest-frame 2-10 keV (16-120 times fainter than typical quasars).
We would expect to obtain ~400-600 hard X-ray (>10 keV) photons with NuSTAR,
provided that these photons are not significantly absorbed (NH<1E24 cm^{-2}).
However, both BAL quasars are only detected in the softer NuSTAR bands (e.g.,
4-20 keV) but not in its harder bands (e.g., 20-30 keV), suggesting that either
the shielding gas is highly Compton-thick or the two targets are intrinsically
X-ray weak. We constrain the column densities for both to be NH~7E24 cm^{-2} if
the weak hard X-ray emission is caused by obscuration from the shielding gas.
We discuss a few possibilities for how PG 1004+130 could have Compton-thick
shielding gas without strong Fe K? line emission; dilution from jet-linked
X-ray emission is one likely explanation. We also discuss the intrinsic X-ray
weakness scenario based on a coronal-quenching model relevant to the shielding
gas and disk wind of BAL quasars. Motivated by our NuSTAR results, we perform a
Chandra stacking analysis with the Large Bright Quasar Survey BAL quasar sample
and place statistical constraints upon the fraction of intrinsically X-ray weak
BAL quasars; this fraction is likely 17-40%.

Previous studies of thermal X-ray emission from Milky Way and Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC) SNRs have shown that Type Ia and core-collapse (CC) SNRs have
statistically different symmetries, and thus these sources can be typed based
on their X-ray morphologies. In this paper, we extend the same technique, a
multipole expansion technique using power ratios, to infrared (IR) images of
SNRs to test whether they can be typed using the symmetry of their warm dust
emission as well. We analyzed archival Spitzer Space Telescope Multiband
Imaging Photometer (MIPS) 24 micron observations of the previously used X-ray
sample, and we find that the two classes of SNRs separate according to their IR
morphologies. The Type Ia SNRs are statistically more circular and mirror
symmetric than the CC SNRs, likely due to the different circumstellar
environments and explosion geometries of the progenitors. Broadly, our work
indicates that the IR emission retains information of the explosive origins of
the SNR and offers a new method to type SNRs based on IR morphology.

(non-iterative)methods applicable. The implicit discretization results in
higher computational cost per time slice compared to the explicit time
marching. However, the latter is subject to a CFL-stability condition, and the
implicit approach becomes significantly more efficient whenever the accuracy
demands on the time-step are less restrictive than the stability. We also

the ICM, which occurs in cool core clusters that have been disturbed by an
off-axis merger with a sub-cluster or group. We present deep Chandra
observations of the cool core cluster Abell 2029, which has a sloshing spiral
extending radially outward from the center of the cluster to approximately 400
kpc at its fullest extent---the largest continuous spiral observed to date. We
find a surface brightness excess, a temperature decrement, a density
enhancement, an elemental abundance enhancement, and a smooth pressure profile
in the area of the spiral. The sloshing gas seems to be interacting with the
southern lobe of the central radio galaxy, causing it to bend and giving the
radio source a wide-angle tail (WAT) morphology. This shows that WATs can be
produced in clusters that are relatively relaxed on large scales. We explore
the interaction between heating and cooling in the central region of the
cluster. Energy injection from the active galactic nucleus (AGN) is likely
insufficient to offset the cooling, and sloshing may be an important additional
mechanism in preventing large amounts of gas from cooling to very low
temperatures.

1549 line that are consistent with Hb mass estimates is uncertain, due in large
part to disagreement between velocity line width measurements for the two
lines. This discrepancy between Hb and CIV arises from the fact that both line
profiles are treated the same way in single-epoch scaling relationships based
on the assumption that the broad-line region is virialized, even though a
non-virialized emission component is often significant in the CIV line and
absent or weak in the Hb line. Using quasi-simultaneous optical and
ultra-violet spectra for a sample of 85 optically bright quasars with redshifts
in the range z=0.03-1.4, we present a significant step along the path to
rehabilitating the CIV line for black hole mass estimates. We show that the
residuals of velocity line width between CIV and Hb are significantly
correlated with the peak flux ratio of SiIV+OIV] 1400 to CIV. Using this
relationship, we develop a prescription for estimating black hole masses from
the ultra-violet spectrum that agree better with Hb-based masses than the
traditional CIV masses. The scatter between Hb and CIV masses is initially 0.43
dex in our sample and is reduced to 0.33 dex when using our prescription. The
peak flux ratio of SiIV+OIV] 1400 to CIV is an ultraviolet indicator of the
suite of spectral properties commonly known as ""Eigenvector 1"", thus the
reduction in scatter between CIV and Hb black hole masses is essentially due to
removing an Eigenvector 1 bias in CIV-based masses.

problems with side constraints which are computationally intractable (NP-Hard)
and for which no optimal (or near optimal) algorithms are known to exist with
sub-exponential running time. All of these problems violate the standard
exchange property, which assumes that the reward from the play of an arm is not
contingent upon when the arm is played. Not only are index policies suboptimal
in these contexts, there has been little analysis of such policies in these
problem settings. We show that if we consider near-optimal policies, in the
sense of approximation algorithms, then there exists (near) index policies.
Conceptually, if we can find policies that satisfy an approximate version of
the exchange property, namely, that the reward from the play of an arm depends
on when the arm is played to within a constant factor, then we have an avenue
towards solving these problems. However such an approximate version of the
idling bandit property does not hold on a per-play basis and are shown to hold
in a global sense. Clearly, such a property is not necessarily true of
arbitrary single arm policies and finding such single arm policies is
nontrivial. We show that by restricting the state spaces of arms we can find
single arm policies and that these single arm policies can be combined into
global (near) index policies where the approximate version of the exchange
property is true in expectation. The number of different bandit problems that
can be addressed by this technique already demonstrate its wide applicability.

  Motion Planning in Many Dimensions",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we present a novel probabilistic sampling-based motion planning
algorithm called the Fast Marching Tree algorithm (FMT*). The algorithm is
specifically aimed at solving complex motion planning problems in
high-dimensional configuration spaces. This algorithm is proven to be
asymptotically optimal and is shown to converge to an optimal solution faster
than its state-of-the-art counterparts, chiefly PRM* and RRT*. The FMT*
algorithm performs a ""lazy"" dynamic programming recursion on a predetermined
number of probabilistically-drawn samples to grow a tree of paths, which moves
steadily outward in cost-to-arrive space. As a departure from previous analysis
approaches that are based on the notion of almost sure convergence, the FMT*
algorithm is analyzed under the notion of convergence in probability: the extra
mathematical flexibility of this approach allows for convergence rate
bounds--the first in the field of optimal sampling-based motion planning.
Specifically, for a certain selection of tuning parameters and configuration
spaces, we obtain a convergence rate bound of order $O(n^{-1/d+\rho})$, where
$n$ is the number of sampled points, $d$ is the dimension of the configuration
space, and $\rho$ is an arbitrarily small constant. We go on to demonstrate
asymptotic optimality for a number of variations on FMT*, namely when the
configuration space is sampled non-uniformly, when the cost is not arc length,
and when connections are made based on the number of nearest neighbors instead
of a fixed connection radius. Numerical experiments over a range of dimensions
and obstacle configurations confirm our theoretical and heuristic arguments by
showing that FMT*, for a given execution time, returns substantially better
solutions than either PRM* or RRT*, especially in high-dimensional
configuration spaces and in scenarios where collision-checking is expensive.

as a primitive have been put forth since at least 1985. Early results showed
good statistical pseudorandomness, and the simplicity of their construction
made them a natural candidate for use in cryptographic applications. Since
those early days of cellular automata, research in the field of cryptography
has developed a set of tools which allow designers to prove a particular scheme
to be as hard as solving an instance of a well- studied problem, suggesting a
level of security for the scheme. However, little or no literature is available
on whether these cellular automata can be proved secure under even generous
assumptions. In fact, much of the literature falls short of providing complete,
testable schemes to allow such an analysis.
  In this thesis, we first examine the suitability of cellular automata as a
primitive for building cryptographic primitives. In this effort, we focus on
pseudorandom bit generation and noninvertibility, the behavioral heart of
cryptography. In particular, we focus on cyclic linear and non-linear au-
tomata in some of the common configurations to be found in the literature. We
examine known attacks against these constructions and, in some cases, improve
the results.
  Finding little evidence of provable security, we then examine whether the
desirable properties of cellular automata (i.e. highly parallel, simple
construction) can be maintained as the automata are enhanced to provide a
foundation for such proofs. This investigation leads us to a new construction
of a finite state cellular automaton (FSCA) which is NP-Hard to invert.
Finally, we introduce the Chasm pseudorandom generator family built on this
construction and provide some initial experimental results using the NIST test
suite.

submanifolds are submanifolds whose defining isometric immersions are

f-bienergy density is a harmonic map; any f-biharmonic function on a compact
manifold is constant, and that the inversions about $S^m$ for $m\ge 3$ are
proper f-biharmonic conformal diffeomorphisms. We derive f-biharmonic
submanifolds equations and prove that a surface in a manifold $(N^n, h)$ is an
f-biharmonic surface if and only it can be biharmonically conformally immersed
into $(N^n,h)$. We also give a complete classification of f-biharmonic curves

satellite and the VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry (VERA) telescopes for
X-ray and radio observations, respectively. For 2FGL J0923.5+1508, a possible
radio counterpart NVSS J092357+150518 is found at 1.4 GHz from an existing

upper limit $F_{\rm 2-8 keV} <$ 1.37 $\times$ 10$^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$

$S_{\rm 6.7 GHz}$ $<$ 19 mJy, implying a steep radio spectrum that is not
expected for a blazar. On the other hand, we detect X-rays from NVSS
J150229+555204, the potential 1.4 GHz radio counterpart of 2FGL J1502.1+5548.
The X-ray spectrum can be fitted with an absorbed power-law model with a photon
index $\gamma$=1.8$^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ and the unabsorbed flux is $F_{\rm 2-8

we detect unresolved radio emission at 6.7 GHz with flux $S_{\rm 6.7 GHz}$=30.1
mJy, indicating a compact, flat-spectrum radio source. If NVSS J150229+555204
is indeed associated with 2FGL J1502.1+5548, we find that its multiwavelength
spectrum is consistent with a blazar at redshift $z \sim 3-4$.

aggregated economic wealth, productivity, inflation, technological change,
innovation and growth. The approach is to treat civilization as an open,
non-equilibrium thermodynamic system that dissipates energy and diffuses matter
in order to sustain existing circulations and to further its material growth.
Appealing to a prior result that established a fixed relationship between a
very general representation of global economic wealth and rates of global
primary energy consumption, physically derived expressions for economic
quantities follow. The analysis suggests that wealth can be expressed in terms
of the length density of civilization's networks and the availability of energy
resources. Rates of return on wealth are accelerated by energy reserve
discovery, improvements to human and infrastructure longevity, and a more
common culture, or a lowering of the amount of energy required to diffuse raw
materials into civilization's bulk. According to a logistic equation, rates of
return are slowed by past growth, and if rates of return approach zero, such
""slowing down"" makes civilization fragile with respect to externally imposed
network decay. If past technological change has been especially rapid, then
civilization is particularly vulnerable to newly unfavorable conditions that
might force a switch into a mode of accelerating collapse.

examples on the dispersion characteristics of the confined (and extended)
plasmonic waves in single- and double-interface structures made up of
dispersive metamaterials interlaced with conventional dielectrics. These
dispersive modes are also substantiated through the computation of local as
well as total density of states. It is observed that the dispersive components
enable the system to support the simultaneous existence of s- and
p-polarization modes in the system. Such effects as this one are solely
attributed to the negative-index metamaterials and are otherwise impossible...

${C_\alpha=

$\alpha=0$ it follows from the theorems by Rudin and Loomis which claim that a
positive harmonic function has a limit along the normal iff the boundary

$\alpha=n-1$ it concerns about the point mass of $\mu$ at $x$ and it follows
from the Beurling minimal principle. For the general case of $\alpha \in

similar way to Rudin's approach. Unfortunately this approach works for a ball

can use conformal mappings and generalise the statement above to sufficiently
smooth domains, in dimension $n\geq 3$ we showed that this generalisation is
possible for $\alpha\in [0,n-1]$ due to harmonic measure estimates. The last
method leads to an extension of the theorems by Loomis, Ramey and Ullrich on
non-tangential limits of harmonic functions to positive solutions of elliptic
differential equations with Holder continuous coefficients.

remarkable for its high star formation rate, 100 Mo/yr, securely estimated from
our deep HST and Spitzer photometry, and the absence of any evidence for strong
AGN activity or gravitational lensing magnification. Our ALMA observations
probe an order of magnitude deeper than previous IRAM observations, yet fail to
detect a 1.2mm dust continuum, indicating a flux <52uJy comparable with or
weaker than that of local dwarf irregulars with much lower star formation
rates. We likewise provide a strong upper limit for the flux of [CII] 158um,
L([CII]) < 5.4x10^7 Lo, a diagnostic of the hot interstellar gas often
described as a valuable probe for early galaxies. In fact, our observations
indicate Himiko lies off the local L([CII]) - star formation rate scaling
relation by a factor of more than 30. Both aspects of our ALMA observations
suggest Himiko is an unique object with a very low dust content and perhaps
nearly primordial interstellar gas. Our HST images provide unique insight into
the morphology of this remarkable source, highlighting an extremely blue core
of activity and two less extreme associated clumps. Himiko is undergoing a
triple major merger event whose extensive ionized nebula of Lyman alpha
emitting gas, discovered in our earlier work with Subaru, is powered by star
formation and the dense circum-galactic gas. We are likely witnessing an early
massive galaxy during a key period of its mass assembly close to the end of the

social networks where people are involved in different types of relationships
and interact through various forms of communication media. The ranking of nodes
in multiplex networks is one of the most pressing and challenging tasks that
research on complex networks is currently facing. When pairs of nodes can be
connected through multiple links and in multiple layers, the ranking of nodes
should necessarily reflect the importance of nodes in one layer as well as
their importance in other interdependent layers. In this paper, we draw on the
idea of biased random walks to define the Multiplex PageRank centrality measure
in which the effects of the interplay between networks on the centrality of
nodes are directly taken into account. In particular, depending on the
intensity of the interaction between layers, we define the Additive,
Multiplicative, Combined, and Neutral versions of Multiplex PageRank, and show
how each version reflects the extent to which the importance of a node in one
layer affects the importance the node can gain in another layer. We discuss
these measures and apply them to an online multiplex social network. Findings
indicate that taking the multiplex nature of the network into account helps
uncover the emergence of rankings of nodes that differ from the rankings
obtained from one single layer. Results provide support in favor of the
salience of multiplex centrality measures, like Multiplex PageRank, for
assessing the prominence of nodes embedded in multiple interacting networks,
and for shedding a new light on structural properties that would otherwise

are an unusual class of phenomena where flowing particles experience
orthogonally directed spin-dependent Lorentz-like forces, analogous to the
conventional Lorentz force for the Hall effect, but opposite in sign for two
spin states. Such spin Hall effects have been observed for electrons flowing in
spin-orbit coupled materials such as GaAs or InGaAs and for laser light
traversing dielectric junctions. Here we observe the spin Hall effect in a
quantum-degenerate Bose gas, and use the resulting spin-dependent Lorentz
forces to realize a cold-atom spin transistor. By engineering a spatially
inhomogeneous spin-orbit coupling field for our quantum gas, we explicitly
introduce and measure the requisite spin-dependent Lorentz forces, in excellent
agreement with our calculations. This atomtronic circuit element behaves as a
new type of velocity-insensitive adiabatic spin-selector, with potential
application in devices such as magnetic or inertial sensors. In addition, such
techniques --- for both creating and measuring the SHE --- are clear
prerequisites for engineering topological insulators and detecting their

the angular distribution of field vectors is preferentially horizontal or
vertical. These answers have been obtained by combining the measured circular
and linear polarizations in different ways to derive the field inclinations. A
problem with these combinations is that the circular and linear polarizations
scale with field strength in profoundly different ways. Here, we avoid these
problems by using an entirely different approach that is based exclusively on
the fundamental symmetry properties of the transverse Zeeman effect for
observations away from the disk center without any dependence on the circular
polarization. Systematic errors are suppressed by the application of a doubly
differential technique with the 5247-5250 \AA\ line pair for observations with
the ZIMPOL-2 imaging polarimeter on the French THEMIS telescope on Tenerife.

similarly happen for charged black hole. We verify that the black hole charge
may be decreased or increased the center of mass energy near the black hole
horizon.

  Dementia and Consciousness","23 pages, 1 figure",,,,"q-bio.OT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The mechanisms underlying major aspects of the human brain remain a mystery.
It is unknown how verbal episodic memory is formed and integrated with sensory
episodic memory. There is no consensus on the function and nature of dreaming.
Here we present a theory for governing neural activity in the human brain. The
theory describes the mechanisms for building memory traces for entities and
explains how verbal memory is integrated with sensory memory. We infer that a
core function of dreaming is to move charged particles such as calcium ions
from the hippocampus to association areas to primary areas. We link a high
level of calcium ions concentrations to Alzheimer's disease. We present a more
precise definition of consciousness. Our results are a step forward in
understanding the function and health of the human brain and provide the public
with ways to keep a healthy brain.

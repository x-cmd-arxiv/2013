OS-LS and the OS-SAGE radio interferometric calibration methods, as a
combination of the Ordered-Subsets (OS) method with the Least-Squares (LS) and
Space Alternating Generalized Expectation maximization (SAGE) calibration
techniques, respectively. The OS algorithm speeds up the ML estimation and
achieves nearly the same level of accuracy of solutions as the one obtained by
the non-OS methods. We apply the OS-LS and OS-SAGE calibration methods to
simulated observations and show that these methods have a much higher
convergence rate relative to the conventional LS and SAGE techniques. Moreover,
the obtained results show that the OS-SAGE calibration technique has a superior
performance compared to the OS-LS calibration method in the sense of achieving
more accurate results while having significantly less computational cost.

coordinated function in the tissue. The pancreatic islets of Langerhans are
responsible for secreting the hormone insulin in response to glucose

beta-cells in the tissue of these excitable islets. It is generally believed
that they are responsible for synchrony of the membrane voltage oscillations
among beta-cells, and thereby pulsatility of insulin secretion. Most attempts
to understand connectivity in islets are often interpreted, bottom-up, in terms
of measurements of gap junctional conductance. This does not, however explain
systematic changes, such as a diminished junctional conductance in type 2
diabetes. We attempt to address this deficit via the model presented here,
which is a learning theory of gap junctional adaptation derived with analogy to
neural systems. Here, gap junctions are modelled as bonds in a beta-cell
network, that are altered according to homeostatic rules of plasticity. Our
analysis reveals that it is nearly impossible to view gap junctions as
homogeneous across a tissue. A modified view that accommodates heterogeneity of
junction strengths in the islet can explain why, for example, a loss of gap
junction conductance in diabetes is necessary for an increase in plasma insulin
levels following hyperglycemia.

entrapment into the 3:2 spin-orbit resonance, open is the question how and when
the capture took place. A recent work by Makarov (2012) has demonstrated that
trapping into this resonance is certain if the eccentricity is larger than 0.2,
provided that we use a realistic tidal model, the one which is based on the
Darwin-Kaula expansion of the tidal torque. The physics-based tidal model
changes dramatically the statistics of the possible final spin states. First,
we discover that after only one encounter with the spin-orbit 3:2 resonance
this resonance becomes the most probable end-state. Second, if a capture into
this (or any other) resonance takes place, the capture becomes final, several
crossings of the same state being forbidden by our model. Third, within our
model the trapping of Mercury happens much faster than previously believed: for
most histories, 10 - 20 Myr are sufficient. Fourth, even a weak laminar
friction between the solid mantle and a molten core would most likely result in
a capture in the 2:1 or even higher resonance. So the principal novelty of our
paper is that the 3:2 end-state is more ancient than the same end-state
obtained when the constant time lag model is employed. The swift capture
justifies our treatment of Mercury as a homogeneous, unstratified body whose
liquid core had not yet formed by the time of trapping. We also provide a
critical analysis of the hypothesis by Wieczorek et al. (2012) that the early
Mercury might had been retrograde, whereafter it synchronised its spin and then
accelerated it to the 3:2 resonance. Accurate processing of the available data
on cratering does not support that hypothesis, while the employment of a
realistic rheology invalidates a key element of the hypothesis, an intermediate
pseudosynchronous state needed to spin-up to the 3:2 resonance.

also a possibility of amplification of the cosmic magnetic fields. From WMAP

a hypergraph whose vertices represent elementary events and hyperedges

to each event a probability, in such a way that events in a given measurement
have a total probability equal to one. We discuss the advantages of this
framework, like the unification of the notions of contexuality and nonlocality,
and give a short overview of results obtained elsewhere.

deformation to simulate a magnification lens on versatile volume datasets and
textured solid models. Compared with other magnification methods (e.g.,
geometric optics, mesh editing), 4D differential geometry theory and its
practices are much more flexible and powerful for preserving shape features
(i.e., minimizing angle distortion), and easier to adapt to versatile solid
models. The primary advantage of 4D space lies at the following fact: we can
now easily magnify the volume of regions of interest (ROIs) from the additional
dimension, while keeping the rest region unchanged. To achieve this primary
goal, we first embed a 3D volumetric input into 4D space and magnify ROIs in
the 4th dimension. Then we flatten the 4D shape back into 3D space to
accommodate other typical applications in the real 3D world. In order to
enforce distortion minimization, in both steps we devise the high dimensional
geometry techniques based on rigorous 4D geometry theory for 3D/4D mapping back
and forth to amend the distortion. Our system can preserve not only focus
region, but also context region and global shape. We demonstrate the
effectiveness, robustness, and efficacy of our framework with a variety of
models ranging from tetrahedral meshes to volume datasets.

where, a new non-equilibrium distribution function for an ion-beam, compressed
by an external electric force, has been derived. This distribution function
allows the system to possess appreciably low and insignificant thermal energy
irrespective of the energy per particle. The spread in the energy among the
particles is attributed to the collisions in presence of the external force,
whereas; for equilibrium, the spreading in energy is due to the absence of the
force. The reactivity for a deuterium-deuterium fusion, using the proposed
distribution function, has been computed. It is shown that the fusion time is
comparable to the energy confinement time, collision time and transit time of
the ion for beam energy greater than 160 keV. The estimated energy gain Q
(ratio of fusion power to the power consumed by the system) is around 10 for
beam energy 160 keV and ion density 1018 cm-3. The energy loss due to particle
scattering is estimated and is taken into consideration in the estimation of
energy gain. An outline of a possible device is proposed according to the model
and is not similar to conventionally used in IEC systems based on collisions of
the beam with a reflex beam or with background gas or plasma.

inclusive DIS and exclusive diffractive processes, including the latest data
from the combined HERA analysis on reduced cross sections within the
Impact-Parameter dependent Saturation (IP-Sat) Model. The impact-parameter
dependence of dipole amplitude is crucial in order to have a unified
description of both inclusive and exclusive diffractive processes. With the
parameters of model fixed via a fit to the high-precision reduced
cross-section, we compare model predictions to data for the structure
functions, the longitudinal structure function, the charm structure function,
exclusive vector mesons production and Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering
(DVCS). Excellent agreement is obtained for the processes considered at small x
in a wide range of Q^2.

into the kinetic energy of a coronal mass ejection (CME): resistive magnetic
reconnection and ideal macroscopic magnetohydrodynamic instability of magnetic
flux rope. However, it remains elusive whether both processes play a comparable
role or one of them prevails during a particular eruption. To shed light on
this issue, we carefully studied energetic but flareless CMEs, \textit{i.e.},
fast CMEs not accompanied by any flares. Through searching the Coordinated Data
Analysis Workshops (CDAW) database of CMEs observed in Solar Cycle 23, we found
13 such events with speeds larger than 1000 km s$^{-1}$. Other common
observational features of these events are: (1) none of them originated in
active regions; they were associated with eruptions of well-developed long
filaments in quiet-Sun regions, (2) no apparent enhancement of flare emissions
was present in soft X-ray, EUV and microwave data. Further studies of two
events reveal that (1) the reconnection electric fields, as inferred from the
product of the separation speed of post-eruption ribbons and the photospheric
magnetic field measurement, were in general weak; (2) the period with a
measurable reconnection electric field is considerably shorter than the total
filament-CME acceleration time. These observations indicate that, for these
fast CMEs, the magnetic energy was released mainly via the ideal flux rope
instability through the work done by the large scale Lorentz force acting on
the rope currents rather than via magnetic reconnections. We also suggest that
reconnections play a less important role in accelerating CMEs in quiet Sun
regions of weak magnetic field than those in active regions of strong magnetic
field.

heterogeneous groups in the population that a sample represents. Mixture
regression models have been applied to address such problems. By modeling the
conditional distribution of the response given the covariate as a mixture, the
sample can be clustered into groups and the individual regression models for
the groups can be estimated simultaneously. This approach treats the covariate
as deterministic so that the covariate carries no information as to which group
the subject is likely to belong to. Although this assumption may be reasonable
in experiments where the covariate is completely determined by the
experimenter, in observational data the covariate may behave differently across
the groups. Thus the model should also incorporate the heterogeneity of the
covariate, which allows us to estimate the membership of the subject from the
covariate.
  In this paper, we consider a mixture regression model where the joint
distribution of the response and the covariate is modeled as a mixture. Given a
new observation of the covariate, this approach allows us to compute the
posterior probabilities that the subject belongs to each group. Using these
posterior probabilities, the prediction of the response can adaptively use the
covariate. We introduce an inference procedure for this approach and show its
properties concerning estimation and prediction. The model is explored for the
functional covariate as well as the multivariate covariate. We present a
real-data example where our approach outperforms the traditional approach,
using the well-analyzed Berkeley growth study data.

  Techniques for Cooperative Wireless Sensor Networks","In IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 2013",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper investigates and compares the performance of wireless sensor
networks where sensors operate on the principles of cooperative communications.
We consider a scenario where the source transmits signals to the destination
with the help of $L$ sensors. As the destination has the capacity of processing
only $U$ out of these $L$ signals, the strongest $U$ signals are selected while
the remaining $(L-U)$ signals are suppressed. A preprocessing block similar to
channel-shortening is proposed in this contribution. However, this
preprocessing block employs a rank-reduction technique instead of
channel-shortening. By employing this preprocessing, we are able to decrease
the computational complexity of the system without affecting the bit error rate
(BER) performance. From our simulations, it can be shown that these schemes
outperform the channel-shortening schemes in terms of computational complexity.
In addition, the proposed schemes have a superior BER performance as compared
to channel-shortening schemes when sensors employ fixed gain amplification.
However, for sensors which employ variable gain amplification, a tradeoff
exists in terms of BER performance between the channel-shortening and these
schemes. These schemes outperform channel-shortening scheme for lower
signal-to-noise ratio.

cohort heterogeneity, i.e. heterogeneity that is not captured by the recorded
covariates. Based on this observation we develop a generic statistical
description of competing risks that unifies the main schools of thought.
Assuming heterogeneity-induced competing risks is much weaker than assuming
risk independence. However, we show that it still imposes sufficient
constraints to solve the competing risk problem, and derive exact formulae for
decontaminated primary risk hazard rates and cause-specific survival functions.
The canonical description is in terms of a cohort's covariate-constrained
functional distribution of individual hazard rates of all risks. Assuming
proportional hazards at the level of individuals leads to a natural
parametrisation of this distribution, from which Cox regression, frailty and
random effects models, and latent class models can all be recovered in special
limits, and which also generates parametrised cumulative incidence functions
(the language of Fine and Gray).
  We demonstrate with synthetic data how the generic method can uncover and map
a cohort's substructure, if such substructure exists, and remove
heterogeneity-induced false protectivity and false exposure effects.
Application to real survival data from the ULSAM study, with prostate cancer as
the primary risk, is found to give plausible alternative explanations for
previous counter-intuitive inferences.

suitable monoidality laws, like those arising when representing stateful
connectors in the tile model, can nicely capture concurrency (in the sense of

molecular dynamics simulations on pore-size effects suggest that graphyne-4,
with 4 acetylene bonds between two adjacent phenyl rings, has the best
performance with 100% salt rejection and an unprecedented water permeability,
to our knowledge, of ~13L/cm2/day/MPa, about 10 times higher than the
state-of-the-art nanoporous graphene reported previously (Nano Lett.s 2012, 12,
3602-3608). In addition, the membrane entails very low energy consumption for
producing 1m3 of fresh water, i.e., 3.6e-3 kWh/m3, three orders of magnitude
less than the prevailing commercial membranes based on reverse osmosis. Water
flow rate across the graphyne-4 sheet exhibits intriguing nonlinear dependence
on the pore size owing to the quantized nature of water flow at the nanoscale.
Such novel transport behavior has important implications to the design of
highly effective and efficient desalination membranes.

For this purpose, in numerical solutions of equations for Dirac radial wave
functions, we introduce a boundary condition at the nucleus boundary such that
the components of the electron current density is zero. As a result, for all
nuclei of the periodic table the calculated energy levels practically coincide
with the energy levels in standard solutions of the Dirac equation in the
external field of the Coulomb potential of a point charge. Further, for Z >
105, the calculated energy level functions E(Z) are monotone and smooth.The
lower energy level reaches the energy E=-mc^{2} (the electron ""drop"" on a

nuclei can be easily used in numerical calculations of energy levels of
many-electron atoms.

Skyrmions admit a non linear superposition principle. One can combine two or

holes are nonradiative: their accretion luminosities are orders of magnitude
below what can be explained by efficient black hole accretion within their
ambient environments. These objects, of which Sagittarius A* is the best-known
example, are also dilute (mildly collisional to highly collisionless) and
optically thin. In order for accretion to occur, magnetohydrodynamic
instabilities must develop that not only transport angular momentum, but also
gravitational energy generated through matter infall, outwards. A class of new
magnetohydrodynamical fluid instabilities -- the magnetoviscous-thermal
instability (MVTI) (Islam12) -- was found to transport angular momentum and
energy along magnetic field lines through large (fluid) viscosities and thermal
conductivities. This paper describes the collisionless and mildly collisional
analogue to the MVTI, the collisional magnetothermal instability (CMTI), that
similarly transports energy and angular momentum outwards, expected to be
important in describing the flow properties of hot, dilute, and radiatively
inefficient accretion flows around black holes. In this paper we derive a form
of the collisionless drift-kinetic equation appropriate for accretion physics.
We construct a local equilibrium for MHD stability analysis in this
differentially rotating disk. We then find and characterize specific
instabilities expected to be important in describing the flow properties of
hot, dilute, and radiatively inefficient accretion flows around black holes,
and show their qualitative similarities to instabilities derived using a fluid
formalism (Islam12). We conclude with further work needed in modeling this
class of accretion flow.

corresponding mass deficit, is explained by postulating the existence of a
hypothetical dark matter. In fact, the behavior of the rotation curves shows
the existence of a constant velocity region, near the baryonic matter
distribution, followed by a quick decay at large distances. In this work, we
consider the possibility that the behavior of the rotational velocities of test
particles gravitating around galaxies can be explained within the framework of
the recently proposed hybrid metric-Palatini gravitational theory. The latter
is constructed by modifying the metric Einstein-Hilbert action with an $f(R)$
term in the Palatini formalism. It was shown that the theory unifies local
constraints and the late-time cosmic acceleration, even if the scalar field is
very light. In the intermediate galactic scale, we show explicitly that in the
hybrid metric-Palatini model the tangential velocity can be explicitly obtained
as a function of the scalar field of the equivalent scalar-tensor description.
The possibility of constraining the form of the scalar field and the parameters
of the model by using the stellar velocity dispersions is also analyzed.
Furthermore, the Doppler velocity shifts are also obtained in terms of the
scalar field. All the physical and geometrical quantities and the numerical
parameters in the hybrid metric-Palatini model can be expressed in terms of
observable/measurable parameters, such as the tangential velocity, the baryonic
mass of the galaxy, the Doppler frequency shifts, and the stellar dispersion
velocity, respectively. Therefore, the obtained results open the possibility of
testing the hybrid metric-Palatini gravitational models at the galactic or
extra-galactic scale by using direct astronomical and astrophysical
observations.

physical mechanism underlying the cascade of energy to small scales in
astrophysical plasma turbulence. Beginning with the equations for
incompressible MHD, an asymptotic analytical solution for the nonlinear
evolution of these Alfven wave collisions is derived in the weakly nonlinear
limit. The resulting qualitative picture of nonlinear energy transfer due to
this mechanism involves two steps: first, the primary counterpropagating Alfven
waves interact to generate an inherently nonlinear, purely magnetic secondary
fluctuation with no parallel variation; second, the two primary waves each
interact with this secondary fluctuation to transfer energy secularly to two
tertiary Alfven waves. These tertiary modes are linear Alfven waves with the
same parallel wavenumber as the primary waves, indicating the lack of a
parallel cascade. The amplitude of these tertiary modes increases linearly with
time due to the coherent nature of the resonant four-wave interaction
responsible for the nonlinear energy transfer. The implications of this
analytical solution for turbulence in astrophysical plasmas is discussed. The
solution presented here provides valuable intuition about the nonlinear
interactions underlying magnetized plasma turbulence, in support of an

the fact that it is often difficult for a single Information System (IS) to

proposed an approach named AspeCiS (An Aspect-oriented Approach to Develop a

from existing ISs by using their artifacts such as existing requirements, and
design. AspeCiS covers the three following phases: (i) discovery and analysis
of Cooperative Requirements, (ii) design of Cooperative Requirements models,
and (iii) preparation of the implementation phase. The main issue of AspeCiS is
the definition of Cooperative Requirements using the Existing Requirements and
Additional Requirements, which should be composed with Aspectual Requirements.
We earlier studied how to elicit the Cooperative Requirements in AspeCiS (phase
of discovery and analysis of Cooperative Requirements in AspeCiS) . We study
here the second phase of AspeCiS (design of Cooperative Requirements models),

delayed detonation of a white dwarf. A variety of models differ primarily in
the method by which the deflagration leads to a detonation. A common feature of
the models, however, is that all of them involve the propagation of the
detonation through a white dwarf that is either expanding or contracting, where
the stellar internal velocity profile depends on both time and space. In this
work, we investigate the effects of the pre-detonation stellar internal
velocity profile and the post-detonation velocity of expansion on the
production of alpha-particle nuclei, including Ni56, which are the primary
nuclei produced by the detonation wave. We perform one-dimensional hydrodynamic
simulations of the explosion phase of the white dwarf for center and off-center
detonations with five different stellar velocity profiles at the onset of the
detonation. We observe two distinct post-detonation expansion phases:
rarefaction and bulk expansion. Almost all the burning to Ni56 occurs only in
the rarefaction phase, and its expansion time scale is influenced by
pre-existing flow structure in the star, in particular by the pre-detonation
stellar velocity profile. We find that the mass fractions of the alpha-particle
nuclei, including Ni56, are tight functions of the empirical physical parameter
rho_up/v_down, where rho_up is the mass density immediately upstream of the
detonation wave front and v_down is the velocity of the flow immediately
downstream of the detonation wave front. We also find that v_down depends on
the pre-detonation flow velocity. We conclude that the properties of the
pre-existing flow, in particular the internal stellar velocity profile,
influence the final isotopic composition of burned matter produced by the
detonation.

ranging from probing exciton delocalisation in biological systems, to
developing a new class of laser, and even in astrophysics. Structures that
super-radiate must also have enhanced absorption, but the former always
dominates in natural systems. Here we show that modern quantum control
techniques can overcome this restriction. Our theory establishes that
superabsorption can be achieved and sustained in certain simple nanostructures,
by trapping the system in a highly excited state while extracting energy into a
non-radiative channel. The effect offers the prospect of a new class of quantum
nanotechnology, capable of absorbing light many times faster than is currently
possible; potential applications of this effect include light harvesting and
photon detection. An array of quantum dots or a porphyrin ring could provide an
implementation to demonstrate this effect.

from a radially symmetry spatial distribution which expands anisotropically

available $BVRI$ photometry in the literature have been collected and used in a
new method that utilizes a template supernova (SN 1998bw) and an analytical
model based on Arnett (1982) to accurately estimate the bolometric properties
of each SN. A statistical analysis of the bolometric properties is then
performed, where it is found that GRB/XRF SNe are the most energetic, and eject
more mass (including nickel content) than Ib, Ic and Ic-BL SNe. The results are
then compared to the existing progenitor models of Ibc SNe, where it is
concluded that it is highly likely that at least two progenitor channels exist
for producing a Ibc SN: most Ibc SNe arise via binary interactions, where the
mass of the stellar progenitor is less than what is attributed to a Wolf Rayet
star. Conversely, the progenitors of Ic-BL and GRB/XRF are more massive than
those of Ib and Ic SNe, though a key difference between them is progenitor
metallicity, with Ic-BL SNe arise from more metal rich progenitors. As mass
loss in massive stars is influenced by metal content, the progenitors of Ic-BL
SNe lose more mass, and therefore more angular momentum, before exploding. It
is expected that the explosion mechanism in Ic-BL and GRB/XRF SNe is
``engine-driven'' (i.e. an accreting black hole, or a millisecond magnetar),
but the increased mass loss of Ic-BL SNe means the central engine is less
powerful than in GRB/XRF SNe. Finally, it is found that the SNe that accompany
GRBs and XRFs are statistically indistinguishable, and some mechanism other
than metallicity is needed to explain the differences in the high-energy
components in these events.

neon Nova Mon 2012, supplemented by the evolution in Stromgren b and y bands
and in the integrated flux of relevant emission lines. Our monitoring started
with the optical discovery of the nova and extend to day +270, well past the
end of the super-soft phase in X-rays. The nova displayed very smoothly
evolving lightcurves. A bifurcation between y and V light-curves took place at
the start of the SSS phase, and a knee developed toward the end of the SSS
phase. The apparent magnitude of the nova at the unobserved optical maximum is
constrained to +2.8=<V=<4.2. The appearance, grow in amplitude and then demise
of a 0.29585 (+/-0.00002) days orbital modulation of the optical brightness was
followed along the nova evolution. The observed modulation has a
near-sinusoidal shape and a weak secondary minimum at phase 0.5. We favor an
interpretation in terms of super-imposed ellipsoidal distortion of the Roche
lobe filling companion and irradiation of its side facing the WD. Similar
lightcurves are typical of symbiotic stars where a Roche lobe filling giant is
irradiated by a very hot WD. Given the high orbital inclination, mutual
occultation between the donor star and the accretion disk could contribute to
the observed modulation. The optical+infrared spectral energy distribution of
Nova Mon 2012 during the quiescence preceeding the outburst is nicely fitted by
a early K-type main-sequence star (~K3V) at 1.5 kpc distance, reddened by
E(B-V)=0.38, with a WD companion and an accretion disk contributing to the
observed blue excess and moderate Halpha emission. A typical early K-type
main-sequence star with a mass of ~0.75 Msun and a radius of ~0.8 Rsun, would
fill its Roche lobe for a P=0.29585 day orbital period and a more massive WD
companion.

general non-hermitian Hamiltonian and identify the phase space flow associated
with it. For the case of unitary evolution we obtain explicit formulas for the
quantum flow, which can be written as a classical part plus semiclassical
corrections. These equations are the analogue of the Wigner flow, which
displays several non-intuitive features like momentum inversion and motion of
stagnation points. Many of these features also appear in the Husimi flow and,
therefore, are not related to the negativity of the Wigner function as
previously suggested. We test the exact and semiclassical formulas for a
particle in a double well potential. We find that the zeros of the Husimi
function are saddle points of the flow, and are always followed by a center.
Merging or splitting of stagnation points, observed in the Wigner flow,does not
occur because of the isolation of the Husimi zeros.

photometry to search for other potential magnetic systems amongst old classical

resemble those of V1500 Cyg, suggesting a highly irradiated companion. The old
novae V446 Her and QV Vul have light curves with large amplitude variations
like those seen in polars, suggesting they might have magnetic primaries. We
extract photometry for seventy nine old novae from the 2MASS Point Source
Catalog and use those data to derive the mean, un-reddened infrared colors of
quiescent novae. We also extract WISE data for these objects and find that
forty five of them were detected. Surprisingly, a number of these systems were
detected in the WISE 22 mum band. While two of those objects produced
significant dust shells (V705 Cas and V445 Pup), the others did not. It appears
that line emission from their ionized ejected shells is the most likely

research. The ever-declining cost and the increasing depth of RNA-Seq have
provided unprecedented opportunities to better identify expressed transcripts.
However, the nonlinear transcript structures and the ultra-high throughput of
RNA-Seq reads pose significant algorithmic and computational challenges to the
existing transcriptome assembly approaches, either reference-guided or de novo.
While reference-guided approaches offer good sensitivity, they rely on
alignment results of the splice-aware aligners and are thus unsuitable for
species with incomplete reference genomes. In contrast, de novo approaches do
not depend on the reference genome but face a computational daunting task
derived from the complexity of the graph built for the whole transcriptome. In
response to these challenges, we present a hybrid approach to exploit an
incomplete reference genome without relying on splice-aware aligners. We have
designed a split-and-align procedure to efficiently localize the reads to
individual genomic loci, which is followed by an accurate de novo assembly to
assemble reads falling into each locus. Using extensive simulation data, we
demonstrate a high accuracy and precision in transcriptome reconstruction by
comparing to selected transcriptome assembly tools. Our method is implemented

critical exponent $z>1$, which is qualitatively similar to those in various

the logarithmic behavior near the boundary in the Lifshitz spacetime.

may be strong enough to reduce estimates of the stellar masses and ages of
galaxies compared those derived assuming broad-band photometry represents
stellar light alone. To test this hypothesis at the highest redshifts where
such lines can be probed with ground-based facilities, we examine the
near-infrared spectra of a representative sample of 20 3.0 < z < 3.8 Lyman
break galaxies using the newly-commissioned MOSFIRE near-infrared spectrograph
at the Keck I telescope. We use this data to derive the rest-frame equivalent
widths (EW) of [O III] emission and show that these are comparable to estimates
derived using the SED fitting technique introduced for sources of known
redshift by Stark et al (2013). Although our current sample is modest, its [O
III] EW distribution is consistent with that inferred for H\alpha\ based on SED
fitting of Stark et al's larger sample of 3.8 < z < 5 galaxies. For a subset of
survey galaxies, we use the combination of optical and near-infrared
spectroscopy to quantify kinematics of outflows in z ~ 3.5 star-forming
galaxies, and discuss the implications for reionization measurements. The
trends we uncover underline the dangers of relying purely on broad-band
photometry to estimate the physical properties of high redshift galaxies and
emphasize the important role of diagnostic spectroscopy.

first associated to the idea of vacuum energy density. Notwithstanding, it is
well-known that there is a huge, in fact appalling, discrepancy between the
theoretical prediction and the observed value picked from the modern
cosmological data. This is the famous, and extremely difficult, ""CC problem"".
Paradoxically, the recent observation at the CERN Large Hadron Collider of a
Higgs-like particle, should actually be considered ambivalent: on the one hand
it appears as a likely great triumph of particle physics, but on the other hand
it wide opens Pandora's box of the cosmological uproar, for it may provide
(alas!) the experimental certification of the existence of the electroweak (EW)
vacuum energy, and thus of the intriguing reality of the CC problem. Even if
only counting on this contribution to the inventory of vacuum energies in the
universe, the discrepancy with the cosmologically observed value is already of
55 orders of magnitude. This is the (hitherto) ""real"" magnitude of the CC

fully unexplored!) ultrahigh energy scales. Such is the baffling situation

will briefly (and hopefully pedagogically) fly over some of the old and new

and recalled us that the vacuum energy may be a fully tangible concept in real
phenomenology, I will exclusively address the CC problem from the original
notion of vacuum energy, and its possible ""running"" with the expansion of the
universe, rather than venturing into the numberless attempts to replace the CC
by the multifarious concept of dark energy.

determine the frequency statistics of the area of the unstable slopes and the

t_{var,obs} ~2 d and the X-ray luminosity L_X ~3.5 X 10^45 erg/s, we constrain
the location of the emitting region to distance scales that are broadly
comparable with the dusty torus. We show that variations in the Compton
dominance parameter by a factor of ~4 --- which may result in the anomalous
outburst --- can be relatively easily accounted for by moderate variations in
the magnetic field strength or the location of the emission region. Since such
variations appear to be rare among FSRQs, we propose that most gamma-ray/OIR

predicting clustering statistics in the Ly-alpha forest on large scales from
moderate resolution simulations of the dark matter distribution, with
calibration from high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of smaller volumes.
We use the ""Horizon MareNostrum"" simulation, a 50 Mpc/h comoving volume evolved
with the adaptive mesh hydrodynamic code RAMSES, to compute the conditional
probability distribution P(F_s|delta_s) of the transmitted flux F_s, smoothed
(1-dimensionally) over the spectral resolution scale, on the dark matter
density contrast delta_s, smoothed (3-dimensionally) over a similar scale. In
this study we adopt the spectral resolution of the SDSS-III BOSS at z=2.5, and
we find optimal results for a dark matter smoothing length sigma=0.3 Mpc/h
(comoving). In extended form, LyMAS exactly reproduces both the 1-dimensional
power spectrum and 1-point flux distribution of the hydro simulation spectra.
Applied to the MareNostrum dark matter field, LyMAS accurately predicts the
2-point conditional flux distribution and flux correlation function of the full
hydro simulation for transverse sightline separations as small as 1 Mpc/h,
including redshift-space distortion effects. It is substantially more accurate
than a deterministic density-flux mapping (""Fluctuating Gunn-Peterson
Approximation""), often used for large volume simulations of the forest. With
the MareNostrum calibration, we apply LyMAS to 1024^3 N-body simulations of a
300 Mpc/h and 1.0 Gpc/h cube to produce large, publicly available catalogs of
mock BOSS spectra that probe a large comoving volume. LyMAS will be a powerful
tool for interpreting 3-d Ly-alpha forest data, thereby transforming
measurements from BOSS and other massive quasar absorption surveys into
constraints on dark energy, dark matter, space geometry, and IGM physics.

improve the accuracy of previous approximate expressions. It is found that, if
running begins at $10^{16}~\rm{GeV}$ $\left(10^5~\rm{GeV}\right)$, decreasing
the UV stop mass below $0.75$ $\left(0.4\right)$ of the weak scale Majorana
gluino mass does not improve the overall fine tuning of the theory. In
contrast, it is possible to raise the first two generation sfermion masses out
of LHC reach without introducing additional tuning. After running, regions of
parameter space favoured by naturalness and consistent with LHC bounds
typically have IR stop masses of order 1.5 TeV (0.75 TeV), and fine tuning of
at least 400 (50) for high (low) scale mediation. We also study the fine tuning
of theories with Dirac gluinos. These allow for substantial separation of the
gluino and sfermion masses and, regardless of the scale of mediation, lead to
relatively low fine tuning of order 50. Hence viable models can still favour
light stops, but this requires extra structure beyond the MSSM field content.

escaping from star-forming galaxies. Using a custom narrowband filter (NB3420)
tuned to wavelengths just below the Lyman limit at z>=2.82, we probe the LyC
spectral region of 49 Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) and 91 Lya-emitters (LAEs)
spectroscopically confirmed at z>=2.82. Four LBGs and seven LAEs are detected
in NB3420. Using V-band data probing the rest-frame non-ionizing UV, we observe
that many NB3420-detected galaxies exhibit spatial offsets between their LyC
and non-ionizing UV emission and are characterized by extremely blue NB3420-V
colors, corresponding to low ratios of non-ionizing to ionizing radiation
(F_UV/F_LyC) that are in tension with current stellar population synthesis
models. We measure average values of F_UV/F_LyC for our LBG and LAE samples,
correcting for foreground galaxy contamination and HI absorption in the IGM. We
find (F_UV/F_LyC)_corr^LBG=82 +/- 45 and (F_UV/F_LyC)_corr^LAE=7.4 +/- 3.6.
These flux-density ratios correspond respectively to relative LyC escape
fractions of f_esc,rel^LBG=5-8% and f_esc,rel^LAE=18-49%, absolute LyC escape
fractions of f_esc^LBG=1-2% and f_esc^LAE=5-15%, and a comoving LyC emissivity
from star-forming galaxies of 8.8-15.0 x 10^24 ergs/s/Hz/Mpc^3. In order to
study the differential properties of galaxies with and without LyC detections,
we analyze narrowband Lya imaging and rest-frame near-infrared imaging, finding
that while LAEs with LyC detections have lower Lya equivalent widths on
average, there is no substantial difference in the rest-frame near-infrared
colors of LBGs or LAEs with and without LyC detections. These preliminary
results are consistent with an orientation-dependent model where LyC emission
escapes through cleared paths in a patchy ISM.

Universe since they last scattered at the weak decoupling epoch when the
temperature of the standard-model plasma was ~MeV. The shear stress of
free-streaming neutrinos imprints itself gravitationally on the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) and makes the CMB a sensitive probe of neutrino
scattering. Yet, the presence of nonstandard physics in the neutrino sector may
alter this standard chronology and delay neutrino free-streaming until a much
later epoch. We use observations of the CMB to constrain the strength of
neutrino self-interactions G_eff and put limits on new physics in the neutrino
sector from the early Universe. Recent measurements of the CMB at large
multipoles made by the Planck satellite and high-l experiments are critical for
probing this physics. Within the context of conventional LambdaCDM parameters
cosmological data are compatible with G_eff < 1/(56 MeV)^2 and neutrino
free-streaming might be delayed until their temperature has cooled to as low as
~25 eV. Intriguingly, we also find an alternative cosmology compatible with
cosmological data in which neutrinos scatter off each other until z~10^4 with a
preferred interaction strength in a narrow region around $G_{\rm eff} \simeq
1/({\rm 10 \, MeV})^{2} \simeq 8.6\times10^8 G_{\rm F}$, where $G_{\rm F}$ is
the Fermi constant. This distinct self-interacting neutrino cosmology is
characterized by somewhat lower values of both the scalar spectral index and
the amplitude of primordial fluctuations. While we phrase our discussion here
in terms of a specific scenario in which a late onset of neutrino
free-streaming could occur, our constraints on the neutrino visibility function

improved NNLO approximation for the pair invariant mass distribution and
compare it with previous, less complete approximations based on logarithmic
terms from NNLL soft-gluon resummation alone. We find that the new NNLO
approximation produces moderate enhancements of the differential cross section
compared to previous ones, the effect being slightly more important at low
values of invariant mass than at high ones. On the other hand, at high values
of invariant mass the new NNLO corrections are dominated by even higher-order
effects included in NNLL soft-gluon resummation, reaffirming the need for

showing some structure over the continuum were characterized as SNe IInS. We
demonstrate that the flux ratio of the underlying SN to the continuum fv is the
most important parameter determining the spectral classification. Thermonuclear
SNe get progressively classified as Ia-CSM, IInS and IIn as fv decreases. The
transition between Ia-CSM and IInS occurs at fv~0.2-0.3. It shown that SNe
Ia-CSM are found at the magnitude range -19.5> M >-21.6, in good agreement with
observations, and that the faintest SN IIn that can hide a SN Ia has M = -20.1.
The sample of SNe Ia-CSM shows an association with 91T-like SNe Ia. Our
experiment does not support that this association is due to a luminosity bias
(91T-like being brighter than normal Ia). We therefore conclude that this
association has real physical origins and we propose that 91T-like explosions
result from single degenerate progenitors. Despite the similarities between SNe
Ibc and SNe Ia, the number of misclassifications between these types was small
and mostly at low S/N. Combined with the luminosity function needed to
reproduce the observed SN Ia-CSM luminosities, it is unlikely that SNe Ibc
constitute an important contaminant within this sample. We show how Type II
spectra transition to IIn and how the Ha profiles vary with fv. SNe IIn fainter
than M = -17.2 are unable to mask SNe IIP brighter than M = -15. A simulation
including radiative transfer shows that our simplified model is a good first
order approximation. The spectra obtained are in good agreement with real data.

transport-induced energy correlations between the two subsystems are of the
same order as the energy fluctuations within each subsystem. The correlations
can be either positive or negative and we give bounds on their values which are
associated with a dynamic energy scale. The different signs originate as a
competition between fluctuations generated near the baths, and fluctuations of
the current between the two subsystems. This interpretation sheds light on
known results for spatially-dependent heat and particle conduction models.

  We propose a novel general approach to the analysis of sequencing data in
which the reference genome does not have to be specified. Using a distributed
architecture we are able to query a remote server for hints about what the
reference might be, transferring a relatively small amount of data, and the
hints can be used for more computationally-demanding work.
  Our system consists of a server with known reference DNA indexed, and a
client with raw sequencing reads. The client sends a sample of unidentified
reads, and in return receives a list of matching references known to the
server. Sequences for the references can be retrieved and used for exhaustive
computation on the reads, such as alignment.
  To demonstrate this approach we have implemented a web server, indexing tens
of thousands of publicly available genomes and genomic regions from various
organisms and returning lists of matching hits from query sequencing reads. We
have also implemented two clients, one of them running in a web browser, in
order to demonstrate that gigabytes of raw sequencing reads of unknown origin
could be identified without the need to transfer a very large volume of data,

Eddington ratio l_x = L_{0.5-10 keV}}/L_{Edd} < 1e-5). Here, we present Chandra
X-ray imaging spectroscopy for three BHXB systems (H 1743-322, MAXI J1659-152,
and XTE J1752-223) as they fade into quiescence following an outburst. Multiple
X-ray observations were taken within one month of each other, allowing us to
track each individual system's X-ray spectral evolution during its decay. We
compare these three systems to other BHXB systems. We confirm that quiescent
BHXBs have softer X-ray spectra than low-hard state BHXBs, and that quiescent
BHXB spectral properties show no dependence on the binary system's orbital
parameters. However, the observed anti-correlation between X-ray photon index
and l_x in the low-hard state does not continue once a BHXB enters quiescence.
Instead, the photon index plateaus to an average value of 2.08+/-0.07 by the
time l_x reaches approximately 1e-5. l_x~1e-5 is thus an
observationally-motivated upper limit for the beginning of the quiescent

to the data, which significantly reduces the standard error when searching for
periodic signals. We determine a standard error for the putative Local Position
Invariance (LPI) coefficient with respect to gravity for a Cs-Fountain H-maser
comparison of 4.8*10^-6 and 10^-5 for a Rb-Fountain H-maser comparison. From
the same data the putative boost LPI coefficients were measured to a precision
of up to parts in 10^11 with respect to the CMB rest frame. By combining these
boost invariance experiments to a Cryogenic Sapphire Oscillator versus H-maser
comparison, independent limits on all nine coefficients of the boost violation
vector with respect to fundamental constant invariance (fine structure
constant, electron mass and quark mass respectively), were determined to a
precision of parts up to 10^10.

Born probability rule has a dynamical origin. For a scalar field on a
radiation-dominated background we construct the exact solution for the
time-evolving wave functional and study properties of the associated field
trajectories. It is shown that the time evolution of a field mode on expanding
space is mathematically equivalent to that of a standard harmonic oscillator
with a 'retarded time' that depends on the wavelength of the mode. In the far
super-Hubble regime the equivalent oscillator evolves over only one Hubble
time, yielding a simple mechanism whereby relaxation to the Born rule can be
suppressed on very large scales. We present numerical simulations illustrating
how the expansion of space can cause a retardation of relaxation in the
super-Hubble regime. Given these results it is natural to expect a suppression
of quantum noise at super-Hubble wavelengths. Such suppression could have taken
place in a pre-inflationary era, resulting in a large-scale power deficit in
the cosmic microwave background.

redshifts significantly affect galaxy evolution, and thus provide important
constraints for galaxy evolution models. Using data from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey-Data Release 7 (SDSS-DR7) and the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA)
surveys we study the relationships and dependencies between SFR, Z, and stellar
mass, as well as the Fundamental Plane for star-forming galaxies. We combine
both surveys using volume-limited samples up to a redshift of z ~ 0.36. The
GAMA and SDSS surveys complement each other when analyzing the relationships
between SFR, Mass and Z. We present evidence for SFR and metallicity evolution
to z ~ 0.2. We study the dependencies between SFR, Mass, Z, and specific
star-formation rate (SSFR) on the M-Z, M-SFR, M-SSFR, Z-SFR, and Z-SSFR
relations, finding strong correlations between all. Based on those
dependencies, we propose a simple model that allows us to explain the different
behaviour observed between low and high mass galaxies. Finally, our analysis
allows us to confirm the existence of a Fundamental Plane, for which Mass=f(Z,
SFR) in star-forming galaxies.

high energy density physics (HEDP) and deliver other useful applications can
sometimes be frustrated by uncertainties in modeling the properties and
expansion of these plasmas using radiation-hydrodynamics codes. In an effort to
overcome this and to corroborate the accuracy of the HEDP capabilities recently
added to the publicly available FLASH radiation-hydrodynamics code, we present
detailed comparisons of FLASH results to new and previously published results
from the HYDRA code used extensively at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
We focus on two very different problems of interest: (1) an Aluminum slab
irradiated by 15.3 and 76.7 mJ of ""pre-pulse"" laser energy and (2) a mm-long
triangular groove cut in an Aluminum target irradiated by a rectangular laser
beam. Because this latter problem bears a resemblance to astrophysical jets,
Grava et al., Phys. Rev. E, 78, (2008) performed this experiment and compared
detailed x-ray interferometric measurements of electron number densities to
HYDRA simulations. Thus, the former problem provides an opportunity for
code-to-code comparison, while the latter provides an opportunity for both
code-to-code comparison and validation. Despite radically different schemes for
determining the computational mesh, and different equation of state and opacity
models, the HYDRA and FLASH codes yield results that are in excellent agreement
for both problems and with the experimental data for the latter. Having
validated the FLASH code in this way, we use the code to further investigate
the formation of the jet seen in the Grava et al. (2008) experiment and discuss
its relation to the Wan et al. (1997) experiment at the NOVA laser.

complementary channels of the former). These results follow by bounding the
success probability in terms of a ""sandwiched"" Renyi relative entropy, by
showing that this quantity is subadditive for all entanglement-breaking and

We show that in the presence of sparsity, the $\ell_{1}$-norm regularization

of neutral and automatically dispersed nitrogen atoms [N0] was measured by
diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFT). A
systematic measurement for the fluorescence intensities and lifetimes of the
crushed monocrystalline diamonds as a function of [N0] indicated that the [NV-]
increases nearly linearly with [N0] at 100 - 200 ppm. The trend, however,
failed to continue for nanodiamonds with higher [N0] (up to 390 ppm) but poorer
crystallinity. We attribute the result to a combined effect of fluorescence
quenching as well as the lower conversion efficiency of vacancies to NV- due to
the presence of more impurities and defects in these as-grown diamond
crystallites. The principles and practice of fabricating brighter and smaller

However, in some applications, their usefulness is limited by the fact that the
separator can be as large as $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ in graphs with $n$ vertices.
This is the case for planar graphs, and more generally, for proper minor-closed
classes. We study a special type of graph separator, called a ""layered
separator"", which may have linear size in $n$, but has bounded size with
respect to a different measure, called the ""width"". We prove, for example, that
planar graphs and graphs of bounded Euler genus admit layered separators of
bounded width. More generally, we characterise the minor-closed classes that
admit layered separators of bounded width as those that exclude a fixed apex
graph as a minor.
  We use layered separators to prove $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ bounds for a number
of problems where $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n})$ was a long-standing previous best
bound. This includes the nonrepetitive chromatic number and queue-number of
graphs with bounded Euler genus. We extend these results with a
$\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ bound on the nonrepetitive chromatic number of graphs
excluding a fixed topological minor, and a $\log^{ \mathcal{O}(1)}n$ bound on
the queue-number of graphs excluding a fixed minor. Only for planar graphs were
$\log^{ \mathcal{O}(1)}n$ bounds previously known. Our results imply that every
$n$-vertex graph excluding a fixed minor has a 3-dimensional grid drawing with
$n\log^{ \mathcal{O}(1)}n$ volume, whereas the previous best bound was

imaging based face recognition has emerged as a promising complement to
conventional, visible spectrum based approaches which continue to struggle when
applied in the real world. While inherently insensitive to visible spectrum
illumination changes, IR images introduce specific challenges of their own,
most notably sensitivity to factors which affect facial heat emission patterns,
e.g. emotional state, ambient temperature, and alcohol intake. In addition,
facial expression and pose changes are more difficult to correct in IR images
because they are less rich in high frequency detail which is an important cue
for fitting any deformable model. We describe a novel method which addresses
these challenges. To normalize for pose and facial expression changes we
generate a synthetic frontal image of a face in a canonical, neutral facial
expression from an image of the face in an arbitrary pose and facial
expression. This is achieved by piecewise affine warping which follows active
appearance model (AAM) fitting. This is the first publication which explores
the use of an AAM on thermal IR images; we propose a pre-processing step which
enhances detail in thermal images, making AAM convergence faster and more
accurate. To overcome the problem of thermal IR image sensitivity to the
pattern of facial temperature emissions we describe a representation based on
reliable anatomical features. In contrast to previous approaches, our
representation is not binary; rather, our method accounts for the reliability
of the extracted features. This makes the proposed representation much more
robust both to pose and scale changes. The effectiveness of the proposed
approach is demonstrated on the largest public database of thermal IR images of
faces on which it achieved 100% identification, significantly outperforming
previous methods.

of semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering asymmetry data on the fragmentation
functions, where the produced hadrons of different electric charge are
identified. We break symmetry assumption between quark and anti-quark
fragmentation functions for favored partons by using the asymmetry data. The

wakefield accelerator is proposed. If the proton drive beam propagates in a
hollow plasma channel, and the beam radius is of order of the channel width,
the space charge force of the driver causes charge separation at the channel
wall, which helps to focus the positively charged witness bunch propagating
along the beam axis. In the channel, the acceleration buckets for positively
charged particles are much larger than in the blowout regime of the uniform
plasma, and stable acceleration over long distances is possible. In addition,
phasing of the witness with respect to the wave can be tuned by changing the
radius of the channel to ensure the acceleration is optimal. Two dimensional
simulations suggest that, for proton drivers likely available in future,
positively charged particles can be stably accelerated over 1 km with the
average acceleration gradient of 1.3 GeV/m.

luminosities towards distant astrophysical objects is that the universe is
expanding, an inference which is found to be consistent with other cosmological
probes as well. Clearly, only the interpretation of {\it dimensionless}
quantities does not depend on the physical unit system as opposed to {\it
dimensional} quantities whose dynamics does depend on the arbitrarily chosen
system of units. All that redshift or luminosity measurements really indicate
is that cosmological scales expand {\it relative} to local scales. An
alternative choice of a ruler could be the distance between two remote
galaxies, in which case local distances have to decrease with time (with
respect to the ruler) for consistency with redshift measurements. In the latter
choice, microscopic scales such as the Compton wavelength, or the Planck
length, decrease with time, and consequently fundamental `constants' such as
the Planck constant, speed of light, Newton gravitational constant, and
particle masses, are spacetime-dependent. To illustrate this fundamental
indeterminacy we construct an alternative interpretation to the expanding model
that is characterized by a static metric with time-dependent fundamental
physical quantities. The two alternative descriptions, are referred to as the
`expanding' and `static' space perspectives, respectively. Cosmological
inflation, recombination, and all other early universe processes are unaltered;
the `expanding' and `static' perspectives are associated with exactly the same
cosmological model.

{\it dimensional} quantities which are {\it defined}, for convenience or

of units may entail variation of fundamental physical quantities (`constants')
in spacetime. The theory of gravitation generally does not satisfy conformal
symmetry, i.e. it is not invariant to local changes of the unit of length.
Consequently, the {\it dimensionless} action associated with the
Einstein-Hilbert action ($S_{EH}$) of gravitation, $\phi_{EH}=S_{EH}/\hbar$, is
not invariant to local changes of the length unit; clearly an unsatisfactory
feature for a dimensionless quantity. Here we amend the phase by adding extra
terms that account for spacetime variation of the physical `constants' in
arbitrary unit systems. In such a unit system, all dimensional quantities are
implicitly spacetime-dependent; this is achieved by a conformal transformation
of the metric augmented by appropriate metric-dependent rescalings of the
dimensional quantities. The resulting modified dimensionless action is
scale-invariant, i.e. independent of the unit system, as desired. The deep
connection between gravitation, dimensionless physical quantities, and quantum
mechanics, is elucidated and the implicit ambiguity in interpretations of

however, contains force which is in conflict with the fundamental assumption of
the force-free model and measurement noise which is unfavorable for practical
computation. Preprocessing of the raw magnetogram has been proposed by
Wiegelmann, Inhester, and Sakurai (2006) to remove the force and noise for
providing better input for NLFFF modeling. In this paper we develop a new code
of magnetogram preprocessing which is consistent with our extrapolation method
CESE-MHD-NLFFF (Jiang, Feng, and Xiang, 2012; Jiang and Feng, 2012). Basing on
a magnetic-splitting rule that a magnetic field can be split into a potential
field part and a non-potential part, we split the magnetogram and deal with the
two parts separately. Preprocessing of the magnetogram's potential part is
based on a numerical potential field model, and the non-potential part is
preprocessed using the similar optimization method of Wiegelmann et al (2006).
The code is applied to the SDO/HMI data and results show that the method can
remove efficiently the force and noise and improve the quality of
extrapolation.

contributions that arise from a discrepancy between the actual metric and the

traditionally involved extra structure on the material manifold, notably
torsion to quantify the density of dislocations and non-metricity to represent
the density of point defects. We show that all the classical defects can be
described within the framework of classical elasticity using tensor fields that
only assume a metric structure. Specifically, bodies with singular defects can
be viewed as affine manifolds; both disclinations and dislocations are captured
by the monodromy that maps curves that surround the loci of the defects into
affine transformations. Finally, we show that two dimensional defects with
trivial monodromy are purely local in the sense that if we remove from the

magnetic fields, from a spherically averaged hydrostatic equation, is much

situation in favor of larger magnetic fields. We conclude that such

distributed communication system where a transmitter-receiver pair is
communicating in parallel with other transmitters. Assume that the channel code
of each transmitter is chosen arbitrarily in each time slot. The coding choice
of a transmitter is denoted by a code index parameter, which is known neither
to other transmitters nor to the receiver. Fundamental performance limitation
of the system is characterized using an achievable region defined in the space
of the code index vectors. As the codeword length is taken to infinity, for all
code index vectors inside the region, the receiver will decode the message
reliably, while for all code index vectors outside the region, the receiver
will report a collision reliably. A generalized system error performance
measure is defined as the weighted sum of probabilities of different types of
communication error events. Assume that the receiver chooses an ""operation
region"" and intends to decode the message if the code index vector is inside
the operation region. Achievable bounds on the tradeoff between the operation
region and the generalize error performance measure are obtained under the
assumption of a finite codeword length.

and a Gaussian distribution of the Cartesian components of the magnetic field
strength, I derive a simple integral that can be used numerically to calculate
the synchrotron emissivity from any electron population. In the case of
power-law spectra, I show that it is possible to estimate the difference
between the synchrotron emissivity from a region with such a field and that
from the commonly assumed arrangement where $B$ is constant everywhere, though
fully tangled, and that this difference is small, though it increases if the
electron energy density scales with the field. An aged electron spectrum in
such a field produces a characteristic curved synchrotron spectrum which
differs significantly from the classical Jaffe-Perola spectrum, and I discuss
some effects that this might have on standard spectral age fitting. Finally, I
show that inverse-Compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background is only
moderately affected by such a field structure, with the effects becoming more
important if the electrons follow the field. Magnetic-field estimates in the
literature from combined synchrotron and inverse-Compton modelling will give
reasonable estimates of the mean magnetic field energy density if the field is
non-uniform but isotropic.

clustering, which is vividly manifested by the presence of rich filament-like
superclusters. The more anisotropic the clustering of galaxy clusters is, the
more straight the rich filament-like superclusters become. Given that the
degree of the anisotropy in the largest-scale clustering depends sensitively on
the nature of dark energy, the supercluster straightness may play a
complimentary role in testing dynamic dark energy models. Here we focus on the
coupled dark energy (cDE) models which assume the existence of dark sector
coupling between scalar field dark energy and nonbaryonic dark matter.
Determining the spines of the superclusters identified in the publicly
available group catalogs from the CODECS (COupled Dark Energy Cosmological
Simulations) for four different cDE models as well as for the LCDM model, we
quantify the straightness of each supercluster as the spatial extent of its
spine per member cluster where a supercluster spine represents the main stem of
the minimal spanning tree constructed out of the member clusters. It is shown
that the dark sector coupling plays a role in making the supercluster less
straight relative to the LCDM case and that in a cDE model with supergravity
potential the superclusters are least straight. We also find that the
difference in the degree of the supercluster straightness between the cDE and
the LCDM cases increases with redshifts. A physical interpretation of our
result as well as its cosmological implication are discussed.

the details of the transition from the former to the latter is imperative to
explain the observational properties of the field. Aging open clusters are one
of the sources of field stars. The disruption rate of open clusters slows down
with age but, as an object gets older, the distinction between the remaining
cluster or open cluster remnant (OCR) and the surrounding field becomes less
and less obvious. As a result, finding good OCR candidates or confirming the
OCR nature of some of the best candidates still remains elusive. One of these
objects is NGC 1252, a scattered group of about 20 stars in Horologium. Here we
use new wide-field photometry in the UBVI pass-bands, proper motions from the
Yale/San Juan SPM 4.0 catalogue and high resolution spectroscopy concurrently
with results from N-body simulations to decipher NGC 1252's enigmatic
character. Spectroscopy shows that most of the brightest stars in the studied
area are chemically, kinematically and spatially unrelated to each other.
However, after analysing proper motions, we find one relevant kinematic group.
This sparse object is relatively close (about 1 kpc), metal poor and is
probably not only one of the oldest clusters (3 Gyr) within 1.5 kpc from the
Sun but also one of the clusters located farthest from the disc, at an altitude
of nearly -900 pc. That makes NGC 1252 the first open cluster that can be truly
considered a high Galactic altitude OCR: an unusual object that may hint at a
star formation event induced on a high Galactic altitude gas cloud. TW Hor and
HD 20286 are unlikely to be part of NGC 1252. NGC 1252 17 is identified as an
unrelated, Population II cannonball star moving at about 400 km/s.

acoustic source by combining the velocity calculated from the subtle Doppler
shift with the one from the inertial sensors of the phone. Then a real-time
precise localization and tracking is enabled by using a few anchor speakers
with known locations. Major challenges in implementing Swadloon are to measure
the frequency shift precisely and to estimate the shaking velocity accurately
when the speed of phone-shaking is low and changes arbitrarily. We propose
rigorous methods to address these challenges, then design and deploy Swadloon
in several floors of an indoor building each with area about 2000m^2. Our
extensive experiments show that the mean error of direction finding is around
2.1 degree when the acoustic source is within the range of 32m. For indoor
localization, the 90-percentile errors are under 0.92m, while the maximum error
is 1.73m and the mean is about 0.5m. For real-time tracking, the errors are
within 0.4m for walks of 51m.

occurs over a large proportion of newly colonized habitats. The expansion load
can persist and represent a major fraction of the total mutation load thousands
of generations after the expansion. Our results extend qualitatively and
quantitatively to two-dimensional expansions. The phenomenon of expansion load
may explain growing evidence that populations that have recently expanded,

standardized as an extension to the Global System for Mobile Communications

backward compatibility with the legacy system. To this end, the Orthogonal
Sub-channels (OSC) concept is employed, where two Gaussian minimum-shift keying
(GMSK) signals are transmitted in the same time slot and with the same carrier
frequency. To fully exploit the possible capacity gain of OSC, new receiver
concepts are necessary. In contrast to the base station, where multiple
antennas can be employed, the mobile station is typically equipped with only
one receive antenna. Therefore, the downlink receiver design is a very
challenging task. Different concepts for channel estimation, user separation,
and equalization at the receiver of an OSC downlink transmission are introduced
in this paper. Furthermore, the system capacity must be improved by suitable
downlink power and resource allocation algorithms. Making realistic assumptions
on the information available at the base station, an algorithm for joint power
and radio resource allocation is proposed. Simulation results show the
excellent performance of the proposed channel estimation algorithms,
equalization schemes, and joint radio resource and power allocation algorithms
in realistic VAMOS environments.

part of the stellar disc during the transit of an exoplanet, then this may be
detected by studying the shape of the transit light curve, presenting another
potential means by which the action of extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) can
be discerned. We model the light curves produced by exoplanets transiting a
star which possesses a Shkadov thruster, and show how the parameters of the
planet and the properties of the thruster can be disentangled. provided that
radial velocity follow-up measurements are possible, and that other obscuring
phenomena typical to exoplanet transit curves (such as the presence of
starspots or intrinsic stellar noise) do not dominate. These difficulties
aside, we estimate the a priori probability of detecting a Shkadov thruster
during an exoplanet transit, which even given optimistic assumptions remains
stubbornly low. Despite this, many exoplanet transit surveys designed for
radial velocity follow-up are on the horizon, so we argue that this remains a
useful serendipitous SETI technique. At worst, this technique will place an
upper limit on the number of Class A stellar engines in the Solar
neighbourhood; at best, this could help identify unusual transiting exoplanet
systems as candidates for further investigation with other SETI methods.

long-range dispersion to known values, and the model is found to accurately
match high-level \emph{ab initio} results for graphite across a wide range of

exfoliation energy of graphite to be 0.31 J/m^2, respectively slightly less and
slightly more than the bulk layer binding energy 0.295 J/m^2/layer. Material

prove that, in contrast to the previous model, this network creation game

longitudinal data when response variables are affected by time-varying
unobserved heterogeneity, which is accounted for by a hidden Markov chain. In
order to avoid bias when using a model of this type in the presence of
informative drop-out, we propose an event-history (EH) extension of the LM
approach that may be used with multivariate longitudinal data, in which one or
more outcomes of a different nature are observed at each time occasion. The EH
component of the resulting model is referred to the interval-censored drop-out,
and bias in LM modeling is avoided by correlated random effects, included in
the different model components, which follow a common Markov chain. In order to
perform maximum likelihood estimation of the proposed model by the
Expectation-Maximization algorithm, we extend the usual backward-forward
recursions of Baum and Welch. The algorithm has the same complexity of the one
adopted in cases of non-informative drop-out. Standard errors for the parameter
estimates are derived by using the Oakes' identity. We illustrate the proposed
approach through an application based on data coming from a medical study about
primary biliary cirrhosis in which there are two outcomes of interest, the

molecule could be formed by the exothermic reaction between two abundant
interstellar species, H2CO and CN. Till date, the reaction rate coefficient for
the formation of this molecule is unknown. Educated guesses were used to
explain the abundance of this molecule by chemical modeling. In this paper, we
carried out quantum chemical calculations to find out empirical rate
coefficients for the formation of HCOCN and different chemical properties
during the formation of HCOCN molecules. Though HCOCN is stable against
unimolecular decomposition, this gas phase molecule could be destroyed by many
other means, like: ion-molecular reactions or by the effect of cosmic rays.
Ion-molecular reaction rates are computed by using the capture theories. We
have also included the obtained rate coefficients into our large gas-grain
chemical network to study the chemical evolution of these species in various
interstellar conditions. Formation of one of the isotopologue(DCOCN) of HCOCN
is also studied. Our study predicts the possibility of finding HCOCN and DCOCN
in the ice phase with a reasonably high abundance. In order to detect HCOCN or
DCOCN in various interstellar environments, it is necessary to know the
spectroscopic properties of these molecules. To this effect, we carried out
quantum chemical calculations to find out different spectral parameters of
HCOCN for the transition in electronic, infrared and rotational modes. We
clearly show how the isotopic substitution (DCOCN) plays a part in the
vibrational progressions of HCOCN.

assembly, including for sub-unit interaction strengths for which it does not
occur in the bulk, and may also decrease single-core assembly time. The
membrane budding rate is strongly increased by hydrodynamic interactions. The
membrane deformation rate is important in determining the finite-time yield.
Higher rates may decrease the entropic penalty for assembly and help guide

evolutionary change within each cancer. The expansion of genetically distinct
sub-clonal populations may explain the emergence of drug resistance and if so
would have prognostic and predictive utility. However, methods for objectively
quantifying ITH have been missing and are particularly difficult to establish
in cancers where predominant copy number variation prevents accurate
phylogenetic reconstruction owing to horizontal dependencies caused by long and
cascading genomic rearrangements.
  Results: To address these challenges we present MEDICC, a method for
phylogenetic reconstruction and ITH quantification based on a Minimum Event
Distance for Intra-tumour Copynumber Comparisons. Using a transducer-based
pairwise comparison function we determine optimal phasing of major and minor
alleles, as well as evolutionary distances between samples, and are able to
reconstruct ancestral genomes. Rigorous simulations and an extensive clinical
study show the power of our method, which outperforms state-of-the-art
competitors in reconstruction accuracy and additionally allows unbiased
numerical quantification of ITH.
  Conclusions: Accurate quantification and evolutionary inference are essential
to understand the functional consequences of ITH. The MEDICC algorithms are
independent of the experimental techniques used and are applicable to both
next-generation sequencing and array CGH data.

mainly governed by internal processes. Effects of environment on the stellar
mass-size relation are evaluated by comparing our results with samples of less
isolated early- and late-type galaxies, as well as, for the first time,
different spiral subtypes. We find no difference in the stellar mass-size
relation for very isolated and less isolated early-type galaxies. We find that
late-type isolated galaxies are ~1.2 times larger than less isolated objects
with similar mass. Isolated galaxies and comparison samples were divided into 6
morphological ranges (E/S0, Spirals, Sb, Sbc, Sc, and Scd-Sdm) and 5 stellar
mass bins between log(M*)=[9,11.5]. In all cases the relation is better defined
and has less scatter for the isolated galaxies. We find that as the
morphological type becomes later the galaxy size (for a fixed stellar mass)
becomes larger. For the lowest stellar mass bins log(M*)=[9,10] we find good
agreement between sizes of AMIGA and comparison spirals. The isolated spiral
galaxies in the high stellar mass bins log(M*)=[10,11] tend to be larger than
less isolated galaxies. This difference in size is found for all spiral
subtypes and becomes larger when we compare fully isolated galaxies with
galaxies having 2 or more satellites (neighbors within 3 magnitudes of
difference at a distance less than 250 kpc from the galaxy). Our results
suggest that massive spiral galaxies located in low density environments, both
in terms of major companions and satellites, have larger sizes than samples of
less isolated galaxies. Hence the environment has played a role in the growth
in size of massive spiral galaxies.

transfer efficiency of molecular aggregates. We contrast the dynamics after
excitation of a quantum mechanical system with that of a classical system. We
demonstrate how a classical description of an ensemble average can be
satisfactorily interpreted either as a single system driven by a continuous
force or as an ensemble of systems each driven by an impulsive force. We derive
the time evolution of the density matrix for an open quantum system excited by
light or by a neighboring antenna. We argue that unlike in the classical case,
the quantum description does not allow for a formal decomposition of the
dynamics into sudden jumps in the quantum mechanical state. Rather, there is a
natural finite time-scale associated with the excitation process. We propose a
simple experiment how to test the influence of this time scale on the yield of
photosynthesis. Because photosynthesis is intrinsically an average process, the
efficiency of photosynthesis can be assessed from the quantum mechanical
expectation value calculated from the second-order response theory, which has
the same validity as the perturbative description of ultrafast experiments. We
demonstrate using typical parameters of the currently most studied
photosynthetic antenna, the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex, and a typical
energy transfer rate from the chlorosome baseplate, that dynamic coherences are
averaged out in the complex despite excitation proceeding through a coherent
superposition of its eigenstates. The dynamic coherence averages out even when
the FMO model is completely free of all dissipation and dephasing. We conclude
that under natural excitation conditions coherent dynamics cannot be
responsible for the remarkable efficiency of the photosynthesis even when
considering the dynamics at a single molecular level.

element in the implementation of quantum information technologies. Speed and
fidelity of transfer are the main objectives which have to be achieved by the
devices even in the presence of imperfections which are unavoidable in any
manufacturing process. To reach these goals, several kinds of spin chains have
been suggested, which differ in the degree of fine-tuning, or engineering, of
the system parameters. In this work we present a systematic study of two
important classes of such chains. In one class only the spin couplings at the
ends of the chain have to be adjusted to a value different from the bulk
coupling constant, while in the other class every coupling has to have a
specific value. We demonstrate that configurations from the two different
classes may perform similarly when subjected to the same kind of disorder in
spite of the large difference in the engineering effort necessary to prepare
the system. We identify the system features responsible for these similarities
and we perform a detailed study of the transfer fidelity as a function of chain
length and disorder strength, yielding empirical scaling laws for the fidelity
which are similar for all kinds of chain and all disorder models. These results
are helpful in identifying the optimal spin chain for a given quantum
information transfer task. In particular, they help in judging whether it is
worthwhile to engineer all couplings in the chain as compared to adjusting only
the boundary couplings.

multi-orbital nature of the electronic excitations. It is then important to
understand the orbital-dependent effects of electron correlations. In this
paper we review the recent theoretical progresses on the metal-to-insulator
transition in multiorbital models for the iron-based superconductors. These
include studies of models that contain at least the 3d xy and 3d xz/yz models,
using a slave-spin technique. For commensurate filling corresponding to that of
the parent iron pnictides and chalcogenideds, a Mott transition generally
exists in all these models. Near the Mott transition, a strongly correlated
metal exhibiting bad metal features and strong orbital selectivity is
stabilized due to the interplay of Hund's coupling and orbital-degeneracy
breaking. Particularly for the alkaline iron selenides, the ordered vacancies
effectively reduce the kinetic energy, thereby pushing the system further into
the Mott-insulating regime; in the metallic state, there exists an
orbital-selective Mott phase in which the iron 3d xy orbital is Mott localized
while the other 3d orbitals are still itinerant. An overall phase diagram for
the alkaline iron selenides has been proposed, in which the orbital-selective
Mott phase connects between the superconducting phase and the Mott-insulating

investigate this peculiar burst by performing a multi-band temporal and
spectral analysis of both the prompt and the afterglow emission. We use
proprietary and publicly available data from Swift, Konus Wind, XMM-Newton,
TAROT as well as from other ground based optical and radio telescopes. We find
some peculiar properties that are possibly connected to the exceptional nature
of this burst, namely: i) an unprecedented large optical delay of 410+/-50 s is
measured between the peak epochs of a marked flare observed also in gamma-rays
after about 2 ks from the first Swift/BAT trigger; ii) if the optical and
X-ray/gamma-ray photons during the prompt emission share a common origin, as
suggested by their similar temporal behavior, a certain amount of dust in the
circumburst environment should be introduced, with rest frame visual dust
extinction of AV=0.3-1.5 mag; iii) at the end of the X-ray ""steep decay phase""
and before the start of the X-ray afterglow, we detect the presence of a hard
spectral extra power law component never revealed so far. On the contrary, the
optical afterglow since the end of the prompt emission shows more common
properties, with a flux power law decay with index alpha=1.6+/-0.1 and a late
re-brightening feature at 1.1 day. We discuss our findings in the context of
several possible interpretations given so far to the complex multi-band GRB

Mpc and longest dimension >1 Gpc, it is claimed that this structure is
incompatible with large-scale homogeneity and the cosmological principle. If
true, this would represent a serious challenge to the standard cosmological

necessarily affected by the discovery of a single large structure. I clarify
this point and provide the first fractal dimension analysis of the DR7 quasar
catalogue to demonstrate that it is in fact homogeneous above scales of at most
130 Mpc/h, which is much less than the upper limit for \Lambda CDM. In
addition, I show that the algorithm used to identify the Huge-LQG regularly
finds even larger clusters of points, extending over Gpc scales, in explicitly
homogeneous simulations of a Poisson point process with the same density as the
quasar catalogue. This provides a simple null test to be applied to any cluster
thus found in a real catalogue, and suggests that the interpretation of LQGs as
`structures' is misleading.

methods used in physics. Our method exploits the split-up technique, thanks to
which the transport step and the nonlocal integral terms in the equation can be
separately considered. The order of convergence of the proposed method is
obtained in the natural space of finite nonnegative Radon measures equipped
with the flat metric. This convergence is studied even adding reconstruction
and approximation steps in the particle simulation to keep the number of
approximation particles under control. We validate our scheme in several test
cases showing the theoretical convergence error. Finally, we use the scheme in
situations in which the EBT method does not apply showing the flexibility of
this new method to cope with the different terms in general structured
population models.

high rate of erasures (missed entries with the known coordinates) and errors
(corrupted entries with unknown coordinates). We discuss here how to implement
the fast version of the greedy algorithm with the maximum efficiency whose
greedy strategy is incorporated into iterations of the basic algorithm.
  We provide numerical evidences that, in the subspace clustering capability,
the fast greedy algorithm outperforms not only the existing state-of-the art

higher than the cost of SSC.

We obtain and analyse radial velocities from the HARPS public spectra of GJ 163

of planet candidates detected might depend on some prior assumptions. Since the
impact of prior choice has not been investigated throughly previously, we study
the effects of different prior densities on the detectability of planet

Sculptor-like galaxies from the satellite galaxy catalogue generated by
implementation of a version of the Munich semi-analytic model for galaxy
formation on the level 2 Aquarius dark matter simulations. We follow explicitly
the evolution of several chemical elements, both in the cold gas out of which
the stars form and in the hot medium residing in the halo. We take into account
in detail the lifetimes of stars of different initial masses, the distribution
of the delay times for type Ia supernova explosions and the dependency of the
stellar yields from the initial metallicity of the stars. We allow large
fractions of metals to be deposited into the hot phase, either directly as
stars die or through reheated gas flows powered by supernova explosions. In
order to reproduce both the observed metallicity distribution function and the
observed abundance ratios of long-lived stars of Sculptor, large fractions of
the reheated metals must never re-enter regions of active star formation. Our
analysis sets further constraints on the semi-analytical models and, at large,
on possible metal enrichment scenarios for the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal
galaxy.

photometry data, including those obtained with 1.5 m telescope at the Maidanak
Observatory. In the longer arm, the large and bright stellar complexes are
located at regular intervals along the arm, but only farther from the galaxy
center. They are joined with the narrow lane of dust, visible only in the
infrared bands. The usual dust lane along the stellar arm inner side is seen
there only at distances closer to the galaxy center. It is well expressed in CO
(H_2) image. We have found, that the second, short arm hosts two dust lanes,
the strong and wide at the inner side, and narrow and irregular along its outer
edge. This outer dust lane is well seen in IR images only. The shorter arm
contains no star complexes at all. Gradients of age and luminosity of stars
across both arms are missing (again excepting the parts of arms located closer
to the center), which is confirmed by our photometric cuts across both arms.
The drastic difference in the morphology of the two symmetric arms (grand
design type) of a galaxy has now been confirmed by objective measurements in
the case of M74. It is unclear why about two third of galaxies with beaded arms
host these ""beads"" (star complexes) in one arm only.

typically the most time-consuming task in particle simulation or correlation
analysis. Straightforward implementations using a double loop over particle
pairs have traditionally worked well, especially since compilers usually do a
good job of unrolling the inner loop. In order to reach high performance on
modern CPU and accelerator architectures, single-instruction multiple-data
(SIMD) parallelization has become essential. Avoiding memory bottlenecks is
also increasingly important and requires reducing the ratio of memory to
arithmetic operations. Moreover, when pairs only interact within a certain
cut-off distance, good SIMD utilization can only be achieved by reordering
input and output data, which quickly becomes a limiting factor. Here we present
an algorithm for SIMD parallelization based on grouping a fixed number of
particles, e.g. 2, 4, or 8, into spatial clusters. Calculating all interactions
between particles in a pair of such clusters improves data reuse compared to
the traditional scheme and results in a more efficient SIMD parallelization.
Adjusting the cluster size allows the algorithm to map to SIMD units of various
widths. This flexibility not only enables fast and efficient implementation on
current CPUs and accelerator architectures like GPUs or Intel MIC, but it also
makes the algorithm future-proof. We present the algorithm with an application
to molecular dynamics simulations, where we can also make use of the effective
buffering the method introduces.

proposed, which ensures the entire security requirements of open applications.
Benefit of using the HTTPI is that it is economical in use, well-suited for
cache proxies, like HTTP is, and provides security against many Internet

terms of performance HTTPI is very close to the HTTP, but much better than

state information at the transmitter (CSIT), the work explores the tradeoff
between performance on the one hand, and CSIT timeliness and accuracy on the
other hand. The work considers a broad setting where communication takes place
in the presence of a random fading process, and in the presence of a feedback
process that, at any point in time, may provide CSIT estimates - of some
arbitrary accuracy - for any past, current or future channel realization. This
feedback quality may fluctuate in time across all ranges of CSIT accuracy and
timeliness, ranging from perfectly accurate and instantaneously available
estimates, to delayed estimates of minimal accuracy. Under standard
assumptions, the work derives the degrees-of-freedom (DoF) region, which is
tight for a large range of CSIT quality. This derived DoF region concisely
captures the effect of channel correlations, the accuracy of predicted,
current, and delayed-CSIT, and generally captures the effect of the quality of
CSIT offered at any time, about any channel.
  The work also introduces novel schemes which - in the context of imperfect
and delayed CSIT - employ encoding and decoding with a phase-Markov structure.
The results hold for a large class of block and non-block fading channel
models, and they unify and extend many prior attempts to capture the effect of
imperfect and delayed feedback. This generality also allows for consideration
of novel pertinent settings, such as the new periodically evolving feedback
setting, where a gradual accumulation of feedback bits progressively improves
CSIT as time progresses across a finite coherence period.

three concrete EUD environments that specifically regard collaborative

one can work in the fiberwise setting over a fixed space B. A fiberwise charged
space over B is a space X equipped with map to B and having two sections. One
can ask whether or not a fiberwise charged space over B is a fiberwise

a necessary and sufficient obstruction. As an application we show how this can

  note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1306.1609",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Over the course of the last decade, infrared (IR) and particularly thermal IR
imaging based face recognition has emerged as a promising complement to
conventional, visible spectrum based approaches which continue to struggle when
applied in practice. While inherently insensitive to visible spectrum
illumination changes, IR data introduces specific challenges of its own, most
notably sensitivity to factors which affect facial heat emission patterns, e.g.
emotional state, ambient temperature, and alcohol intake. In addition, facial
expression and pose changes are more difficult to correct in IR images because
they are less rich in high frequency detail which is an important cue for
fitting any deformable model. In this paper we describe a novel method which
addresses these major challenges. Specifically, when comparing two thermal IR
images of faces, we mutually normalize their poses and facial expressions by
using an active appearance model (AAM) to generate synthetic images of the two
faces with a neutral facial expression and in the same view (the average of the
two input views). This is achieved by piecewise affine warping which follows
AAM fitting. A major contribution of our work is the use of an AAM ensemble in
which each AAM is specialized to a particular range of poses and a particular
region of the thermal IR face space. Combined with the contributions from our
previous work which addressed the problem of reliable AAM fitting in the
thermal IR spectrum, and the development of a person-specific representation
robust to transient changes in the pattern of facial temperature emissions, the
proposed ensemble framework accurately matches faces across the full range of
yaw from frontal to profile, even in the presence of scale variation (e.g. due
to the varying distance of a subject from the camera).

profiles were converted to dielectric permittivity profiles using the Complex
Refractive Index Method relation. We then used the GprMax suite of programs to
generate radargrams and to follow the wetting front using arrival time of
electromagnetic waves recorded by a Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR).
Theoretically, the depth of the inflection point of the water content profile
simulated at any infiltration time step is related to the peak of the reflected
amplitude recorded in the corresponding trace in the radargram. We used this
relationship to invert the saturated hydraulic conductivity for constant and
falling head infiltrations. We present our method on synthetic examples and on
two experiments carried out on sand. We further discuss the possibility of
estimating two other van Genuchten parameters, n and \alpha, in addition to the

with an abstract (and usually symbolic) framework, which provides a logical
structure to the practice and development of a scientific theory. The
metaphysical underpinning of science includes statements about the process of
science itself, and the nature of both the philosophical and material objects
involved in a scientific investigation. By developing a formalism for an
abstract mathematical description of inherently non-mathematical (physical)
objects, an attempt is made to clarify the mechanisms and implications of the
philosophical tool of Ansatz. Outcomes of this style of analysis include a
possible explanation for the philosophical issue of the 'unreasonable
effectiveness' of mathematics as raised by Wigner, and an investigation into
formal definitions of the terms: 'principles', 'evidence', 'existence' and
'universes', that are consistent with the conventions used in physics.
  It is found that the formalism places restrictions on the mathematical
properties of objects that represent the tools and terms mentioned above. This
allows one to make testable predictions regarding physics itself (where the
nature of the tools of investigation is now entirely abstract) just as
scientific theories make predictions about the universe at hand. That is, the
mathematical structure of objects defined within the new formalism has
philosophical consequences (via logical arguments) that lead to profound
insights into the nature of the universe, which may serve to guide the course
of future investigations in science and philosophy, and precipitate inspiring
new avenues of integrated research.

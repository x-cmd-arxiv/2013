component, such as a grating or a diffractive lens, directs light into a chosen
order of diffraction, it is necessary that it be ""blazed"". The efficiency of
most diffractive optical components reported so far varies with the wavelength,
and blazing is achieved only at a specific nominal energy, the blaze
wavelength. The existence of spurious light in undesirable orders represents a
severe limitation that prevents using diffractive components in broadband
systems. Here we experimentally demonstrate that broadband blazing over almost
one octave can be achieved by combining advanced optical design strategies and
artificial dielectric materials that offer dispersion chromatism much stronger

efficient funneling of the energy into a specific order over a broad spectral

closed set $A$ in $U$ is called \emph{unavoidable in $U$}, if Brownian motion,
starting in $x\in U\setminus A$ and killed when leaving $U$, hits $A$ almost
surely or, equivalently, if the harmonic measure for $x$ with respect to
$U\setminus A$ has mass $1$ on $A$. First a new criterion for unavoidable sets
is proven which facilitates the construction of smaller and smaller unavoidable
sets in $U$. Starting with an arbitrary champagne subdomain of $U$ (which is
obtained omitting a locally finite union of pairwise disjoint closed balls
$\overline B(z, r_z)$, $z\in Z$, satisfying $\sup_{z\in Z}
r_z/\mbox{dist}(z,U^c)<1$), a combination of the criterion and the existence of
small nonpolar compact sets of Cantor type yields a set $A$ on which harmonic
measures for $U\setminus A$ are living and which has Hausdorff dimension $d-2$
and, if $d=2$, logarithmic Hausdorff dimension $1$.

processes) on Euclidean space and for censored stable processes on $C^{1,1}$
open subsets. Finally, in the very general setting of a balayage space
$(X,\mathcal W)$ on which the function $1$ is harmonic (which covers not only
large classes of second order partial differential equations, but also
non-local situations as, for example, given by Riesz potentials, isotropic
unimodal L\'evy processes or censored stable processes) a construction of
champagne subsets $X\setminus A$ of $X$ with small unavoidable sets $A$ is
given which generalizes (and partially improves) recent constructions in the

Published values of the underestimation factor, $\eta$, using several different

question by employing an exceptionally large data set of 262 differential light
curves (DLCs) derived from 262 pairs of non-varying stars monitored under our

variability (INOV) of prominent AGN classes. The bulk of these data were taken

is close to our recently reported value of $\eta$ = 1.5. Moreover, this
consistency holds at least up to a brightness mismatch of 1.5 mag between the
paired stars. From this we infer that a magnitude difference of at least up to
1.5 mag between a point-like AGN and comparison star(s) monitored
simultaneously is within the same CCD chip acceptable, as it should not lead to
spurious claims of INOV.

are more effective in producing grand minima; (b) both sudden and gradual

waiting times between grand minima seem to be exponential; (d) the coherence
time of the meridional circulation has an effect on the number and the average
duration of grand minima, a coherence time of about 30 years being consistent
with observational data. We also study the occurrence of grand maxima and find
that the distributions of durations and waiting times between grand maxima are
also exponential, like the grand minima. Finally we address the question
whether the Babcock-Leighton mechanism can be operative during grand minima

lines of the element technetium (Tc) occupy two different regions in a diagram
of near- to mid-infrared colour versus pulsation period. Tc is an indicator of
a recent or ongoing mixing event called the third dredge-up (3DUP), and the
near- to mid-IR colour, such as the (K-[22]) colour where [22] is the the 22
micron band of the WISE space observatory, is an indicator of the dust
mass-loss rate of a star. Methods: We collected data from the literature about
the Tc content, pulsation period, and near- and mid-infrared magnitudes of more
than 190 variable stars on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) to which Miras
belong. The sample is naturally biased towards optical AGB stars, which have
low to intermediate (dust) mass-loss rates. Results: We show that a clear
relation between dust mass-loss rate and pulsation period exists if a
distinction is made between Tc-poor and Tc-rich Miras. Surprisingly, at a given
period, Tc-poor Miras are redder in (K-[22]) than are Tc-rich Miras; i.e. they
have higher mass-loss rates than the Tc-rich Miras. A few stars deviate from
this trend; physical explanations are given for these exceptions, such as
binarity or high mass. Conclusions: We put forward two hypotheses to explain
this dichotomy and conclude that the two sequences formed by Tc-poor and
Tc-rich Miras are probably due to the different masses of the two groups. The
pulsation period has a strong correlation with the dust-mass loss rate,
indicating that the pulsations are indeed triggering a dust-driven wind. The
location in the (K-[22]) vs. period diagram can be used to distinguish between
pre- and post-3DUP Miras, which we apply to a sample of Galactic bulge AGB
stars. We find that 3DUP is probably not common in AGB stars in the inner
bulge.

both the ""slow"" and the ""fast"" processes and the diffusion terms may be
correlated. The diffusion term in the ""slow"" process is small. A large
deviation principle is obtained for the joint distribution of the slow process
and of the empirical measure of the fast process. By projecting on the slow and
fast variables, we arrive at new results on large deviations in the averaging
framework and on large deviations of the empirical measures of ergodic
diffusions, respectively. The proof of the main result relies on the property
that exponential tightness implies large deviation relative compactness. The
identification of the large deviation rate function is accomplished by
analysing the large deviation limit of an exponential martingale.

important to understand the physics of molecular clouds to investigate how
filaments form and what is the role played by various processes such as
turbulence and magnetic field.} {We use ideal MHD simulations to study the
formation of clumps in various conditions including different magnetization and
Mach numbers as well as two completely different setup. We then perform several
analysis to compute the shape of the clumps and their link to velocities and
forces using various approaches.} {We find that on average, clumps in MHD
simulations are more filamentary that clumps in hydrodynamical simulations.
Detailed analyses reveal that the filaments are in general preferentially
aligned with the strain which means that these structures simply result from
the strech induced by turbulence. Moreover filaments tend to be confined by the
Lorentz force which therefore lead them to survive longer in magnetized flows.
We show that they have in all simulations a typical thickness equal to a few
grid cells suggesting that they are primarily associated to the energy
dissipation within the flow. We estimate the order of magnitude of the
dissipation length associated to the ion-neutral friction and conclude that in
well UV shielded regions it is of the order of 0.1 pc and therefore could
possibly set the typical size of non self-gravitating filaments.} {Filaments
are ubiquitous because they are the results of the very generic turbulent
strain and because magnetic field help to keep them coherent. We suggest that
energy dissipation is playing a determinant role in their formation.}

using de Haas-van Alphen oscillations, can be used to probe changes in the

unconventional ordered states, this allows an underlying electronic order
parameter to be followed to very low temperatures. We describe this effect in
the field-induced antiferroquadrupolar (AFQ) ordered phase of PrOs4Sb12, a
heavy fermion intermetallic compound. We find that the phase of de Haas-van
Alphen oscillations is sensitively coupled, through the Fermi volume, to the
configuration of the Pr f-electron states that are responsible for AFQ order.
In particular, the \beta-sheet of the Fermi surface expands or shrinks as the
occupancy of two competing localized Pr crystal field states changes. Our
results are in good agreement with previous measurements, above 300 mK, of the
AFQ order parameter by other methods. In addition, the low temperature
sensitivity of our measurement technique reveals a strong and previously
unrecognized influence of hyperfine coupling on the order parameter below 300
mK within the AFQ phase. Such hyperfine couplings could provide insight into
the nature of hidden order states in other systems.

oxygen-functionalized armchair graphene nanoribbons (AGNRs) are investigated
using first-principles density functional theory (DFT). Our study shows that
O-passivation results in a rich geometrical environment which in turn
determines the electronic and magnetic properties of the AGNR. For planar
systems a degenerate magnetic ground state, arising from emptying of O
lone-pair electrons, is reported. DFT predicts ribbons with ferromagnetic
coupling to be metallic whereas antiferromagnetically coupled ribbons present
three band gap families: one metallic and two semiconducting. Unlike hydrogen
functionalized AGNRs, the oxygen functionalized ribbons can attain a lower
energy configuration by adopting a non-planar geometry. The non-planar
structures are non-magnetic and show three semiconducting families of band gap
behavior. Quasiparticle corrections to the DFT results predict a widening of
the band gaps for all planar and non-planar, semiconducting systems. This
suggests that oxygen functionalization could be used to manipulate the
electronic structures of AGNRs.

Is there a preferred (bipartite) structure of an open system? Are there any
practical advantages of certain alternative structures of the system? Is there
a simple dynamical relation for a pair of structures? The [necessarily partial]
answers are rather intriguing. Relativity of quantum correlations (that include
entanglement as well as the ""one-way"" and ""two-way"" discord) is carefully
presented. Emphasis is placed on the ""parallel occurrence of decoherence"" in
the quantum Brownian motion. The environment-selected preferred structure of an
open composite system is presented for a pair of harmonic oscillators (or the

a consequence of quantum correlations relativity. Hence, describing dynamics of
an alternate open-system is a delicate task. Certain interpretational issues,

to reference protest action and specific places and and times. Tying these

Space Telescope, characterization of exoplanet atmospheres from the ground have
been playing an increasingly important role in the analysis of such atmospheres
thanks to the enhancement of telluric correction techniques. At present,
several species have been discovered in the atmosphere of HD 209458b, all of
them consistent with theoretical models. Aims: Data acquired using the High
Dispersion Spectrograph on the Subaru telescope are re-analysed. We expect to
discover new species in the atmosphere of the exoplanet HD 209458b. In addition
to shed light on the atmospheric composition, we will derive the radial
extension of the absorbents present in the atmosphere of the exoplanet.
Methods: We present an alternative method to correct the telluric effects
through the analysis of variations in spectral lines with the airmass. To
search absorptions due to an exoplanetary atmosphere we implemented an
algorithm to automatically search for all the features presenting an
atmospheric signature in the transmission spectrum and through the wavelength
range in the data. In order to estimate uncertainties we perform a
bootstrapping analysis. Results: Absorption excess due to the transitions of
Calcium at 6162.17A and 6493.78A, Scandium at 5526.79A, Hydrogen at 6562.8A and

the case when the particles perform anomalous diffusion on a cubic lattice. The
anomalous diffusion is realized via L\'evy flights, which are characterized by
long-range jumps and lead to superdiffusive behavior. As a consequence, the
critical dimension depends continuously on the control parameter of the L\'evy
flight distribution. This instance is used to study the system close to the
critical dimension by means of the nonperturbative renormalization group
theory. Close to the critical dimension, the assumption of well-stirred
reactants is violated by anticorrelations between the particles, and the law of
mass action breaks down. The breakdown of the law of mass action is known to be
caused by long-range fluctuations. We identify three interrelated consequences
of these fluctuations. First, despite being a nonuniversal quantity and thus
depending on the microscopic details, the renormalized reaction rate can be
approximated by a universal law close to the critical dimension. The emergence
of universality relies on the fact that long-range fluctuations suppress the
influence of the underlying microscopic details. Second, as criticality is
approached, the macroscopic reaction rate decreases such that the law of mass
action loses its significance. And third, additional nonanalytic power law
corrections complement the analytic law of mass action term. An increasing
number of those corrections accumulate and give an essential contribution as
the critical dimension is approached. We test our findings for two
implementations of L\'evy flights that differ in the way they cross over to the
normal diffusion.

indicate the existence of a much warmer gas component (~400 K) confirming
earlier findings from H_{2} rotational line analysis from ISO and Spitzer. The

Photon-dominated region (PDR) models although additional heating by e.g. cosmic

[C] column density of 2.1x10^{17} cm^{-2} and the fact that [CI] is weaker than
CO emission in IC342 suggests that [CI] likely arises in a thin layer on the

cutoff surface $\Sigma_c$, dual to the nondynamical and dynamical Chern-Simons
(CS) modified gravities. Using nonrelativistic long-wavelength expansion
method, the field equations are solved up to $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$ in the
nondynamical model. It is shown that there exists nonvortical dual fluid with
shear viscosity $\eta$ and Hall viscosity $\eta_A$ on the cutoff surface
$\Sigma_c$. The ratio of shear viscosity over entropy density $\eta/s$ of the
fluid takes the universal value $1/{4\pi}$, while the ratio of Hall viscosity
over entropy density $\eta_A/s$ depends on the $\Sigma_c$ and black brane
charge $q$. Moreover the nonvortical dual fluid obeys the magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) equation. However, these kinematic viscosities $\nu$ and $\nu_A$ related
to $\eta$ and $\eta_A$ do not appear in this MHD equation, due to the
constraint condition $\tilde{\partial}^2\beta_j=0$ for the $(2+1)$-dimensional
dual fluid. Then, we extend our discussion to the dynamical CS modified gravity
and show that the dual vortical fluid possesses another so-called Curl
viscosity $\zeta_A$, whose ratio to entropy density $\zeta_A/s$ also depends on
the $\Sigma_c$ and $q$. Moreover, the value of $\eta/s$ still equals to
$1/4\pi$ and the result of $\eta_A/s$ agrees to the previous result under the
probe limit of the pseudo scalar field at the infinite boundary in the charged
black brane background for the dynamical CS modified gravity. This vortical
dual fluid corresponds to the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence equation in
plasma physics.

data mining problem. In predictive (supervised) problems, the quality and
availability of features determines the predictability of the dependent
variable, and the performance of data mining models in terms of
misclassification or regression error. Good features, however, are usually
difficult to obtain. It is usual that many instances come with missing values,
either because the actual value for a given attribute was not available or
because it was too expensive. This is usually interpreted as a utility or
cost-sensitive learning dilemma, in this case between misclassification (or
regression error) costs and attribute tests costs. Both misclassification cost
(MC) and test cost (TC) can be integrated into a single measure, known as joint
cost (JC). We introduce methods and plots (such as the so-called JROC plots)
that can work with any of-the-shelf predictive technique, including ensembles,
such that we re-frame the model to use the appropriate subset of attributes
(the feature configuration) during deployment time. In other words, models are
trained with the available attributes (once and for all) and then deployed by
setting missing values on the attributes that are deemed ineffective for
reducing the joint cost. As the number of feature configuration combinations
grows exponentially with the number of features we introduce quadratic methods
that are able to approximate the optimal configuration and model choices, as
shown by the experimental results.

theory formalism developed by Wigner and Weinberg. In particular, we explore
the possibility that the W^{\pm} and Z bosons have an additional scalar degree
of freedom and show that Elko is a fermionic dark matter candidate. We show
that the massive vector fields of indefinite spin are consistent with Poincare
symmetry and have physically desirable properties that are absent for their
pure spin-one counterpart. Using the new vector fields, the decay of the
W^{\pm} and Z bosons to leptons at tree-level are in agreement with the
Standard Model (SM) predictions. For higher order scattering amplitudes, the
theory has better convergent behaviour than the intermediate vector boson model
and the Fermi theory. Elko has the unusual property that it satisfies the
Klein-Gordon but not the Dirac equation and has mass dimension one instead of
three-half. We show that the Elko fields are local only along a preferred axis
and that they violate Lorentz symmetry. Motivated by the results obtained by
Ahluwalia and Horvath that the Elko spin-sums are covariant under very special
relativity (VSR) transformations, we derive the VSR particle states and quantum
fields. We show that the VSR particles can only interact with the SM particles

outstanding conflict between the principles of locality and realism and offers
new insight on the so-called weak values of physical observables. The
discussion is presented in the context of Bohm's system of two photons in their
singlet polarization state in which the Einstein-Podolski-Rosen paradox is
commonly addressed. It is shown that quantum states can be understood as
statistical mixtures of non-interfering pseudo-classical paths in a {\it
hidden} phase space, in a way that overcomes the implicit assumptions of Bell's
theorem and reproduces all expected values and correlations. The polarization
properties of the photons along these paths are gauge-dependent magnitudes,
whose actual values get fixed only after a reference direction is set by the
observer of either photon A or B. Furthermore, these values are not constrained
to fulfill standard classical algebraic relationships. These {\it hidden} paths
can be grouped into coarser ones consistent with particular post-selection
conditions for a complete set of commuting observables and along which every
physical observable gets on average its corresponding weak value. Obviously,
different sets of commuting observables lead to different coarse statistical
representations of the same quantum state. This interpretation follows from the
observation that in the Heisenberg picture of a closed quantum system in state
$|\Psi>$ every physical observable ${\cal O}(t)=e^{+i H t} {\cal O} e^{-i H t}$
can be represented by an operator $P_{o(t)}$ within a commutative algebra, such
that ${\cal O}(t)|\Psi>=P_{o(t)}|\Psi>$. The formalism presented here may
become a useful tool for performing numerical simulations of quantum systems.

method. The simulation shows that an evanescent wave is reflected from the
structure at the interface between a high index dielectric material and a low
index material. The reflected evanescent wave couples into the upper medium and
radiates its energy forming a retro-reflected wave, which appears as a sharp
peak near the edge of the structure when imaging the structure in
hyper-numerical-aperture solid immersion microscopy. We propose a simple theory
and verify it through FDTD calculation under various circumstances in order to
explain peculiar features of this phenomenon. Furthermore, we suggest a way to
control the reflection of the evanescent wave by taking advantage of the

method for calculating molecular vibration frequencies and normal modes. The VW
transformation yields precisely the same eigenmodes and and eigenfrequencies
that are found with the GF method. The transformation proceeds entirely in the
mass-normalized Cartesian coordinates of the individual atoms, with no
transformations to internal coordinates. The VW transformation thus offers an
enormous computational simplification over the GF method, namely the
mathematical apparatus needed to transform to internal coordinates is
eliminated. All need for new researchers to understand the complex matrix
transformations underlying the GF method is thus also removed. The VW
transformation is not a projection method; the internal vibrations remain
dispersed over all 3N atomic coordinates. In the VW method, the 3N x 3N force
constant matrix V is replaced with a new 3N x 3N matrix W. The replacement is
physically transparent. The matrix W has the same internal normal modes and
vibration frequencies that V does. However, unlike V, W is not singular, so the
normal modes and normal mode frequencies can be obtained using conventional
matrix techniques.

concept of a rigid quasilocal frame (RQF) introduced in previous work. The RQF
approach allows us to construct, in a generic spacetime, frames of reference
whose boundaries are rigid (their shape and size do not change with time), and
that have precisely the same six arbitrary time-dependent degrees of freedom as
the accelerating and tumbling rigid frames we are familiar with in Newtonian
mechanics. These RQFs, in turn, give rise to a completely general conservation
law for the six components of momentum (three linear and three angular) of a
finite system of matter and gravitational fields. We compare in detail this
quasilocal RQF approach to constructing conservation laws with the usual local
one based on spacetime symmetries, and discuss the shortcomings of the latter.
These RQF conservation laws lead to a deeper understanding of physics in the
form of simple, exact, operational definitions of gravitational energy and
momentum fluxes, which in turn reveal, for the first time, the exact, detailed

First, we propose a valid inference procedure for parameter estimation based on
parametric residual bootstrap after Lasso+mLS and Lasso+Ridge. Second, we
derive the asymptotic unbiasedness of Lasso+mLS and Lasso+Ridge. More
specifically, we show that their biases decay at an exponential rate and they
can achieve the oracle convergence rate of $s/n$ (where $s$ is the number of
nonzero regression coefficients and $n$ is the sample size) for mean squared

predictors with probability converging to 1 and the estimates of nonzero
parameters have the same asymptotic normal distribution that they would have if
the zero parameters were known in advance. In fact, our analysis is not limited

function $f$ with domain $G$ such that each component of $\partial{G}$ consists
of a level curve of $f$. (A primary example of such a function being a ratio of
finite Blaschke products of different degrees, with domain $\mathbb{D}$.) We
will first prove several facts about a single bounded level curve of a $f$ in
isolation from the other level curves of $f$. We will then study how the level
curves of $f$ lie with respect to each other. It is natural to expect that the
sets $\{z:|f(z)|=\epsilon\}$ vary continuously as $\epsilon$ varies. We will
make this notion explicit, and use this continuity to prove several results
about the bounded level curves of $f$. It is well known that if $z_0$ is a zero
or a pole of $f$, then $f$ is conformally equivalent to the function
$z\mapsto{z^k}$ (for some $k\in\mathbb{Z}$) in a neighborhood of $z_0$. We
generalize this fact by finding a natural decomposition of $G$ into finitely
many sub-regions (also bounded by level curves of $f$), on each of which $f$ is
conformally equivalent to $z\mapsto{z^k}$ (for some $k\in\mathbb{Z}$). Also
included is a new proof, using level curves, of the Gauss--Lucas theorem that
the critical points of a polynomial are contained in the convex hull of the
polynomial's zeros.

different applications like payTV, e-commerce, health-card can easily be
implemented in a single java card as multiple applets corresponding to each

the effect of the structure parameters on the CP luminescence and radiation

from the bottom methane bubbles were caught by different traps with transparent

trap, the bubbles could be transformed into two different solid hydrate
structures depending on ambient conditions. The first structure is hydrate
granular matter consisted of solid fragments with sizes of order of 1 mm. The
second structure is high porous solid foam consisted of solid bubbles with
sizes of order of 5 mm. The formed granular matter did not change during trap
lifting up to top border of gas hydrate stability zone, whereas free methane
intensively released from solid foam sample during it lifting. It was concluded
that the decrease of the depth of bubble sampling and the decrease of the

increase of the depth of bubble sampling and growth of bubble flux rate assist
to conversation of bubbles into high porous solid hydrate foam.

orchestration engine called QoS-WSOE. More importantly, we establish a formal
model of QoS-WSOE based on actor systems theory. Within the formal model, we
use a three-layered pyramidal structure to capture the requirements of the
customers with a concept named QoS-Aware WSO Service, characteristics of
QoS-WSOE with a concept named QoS-Aware WSO System, and structures and
behaviors of QoS-WSOE with a concept named QoS-Aware WSO Behavior. Conclusions
showing that a system with QoS-Aware WSO Behavior is a QoS-Aware WSO System and
further can provide QoS-Aware WSO Service are drawn.

The sample includes 10 nearby spiral galaxies, in which structures at sub-kpc
scales are spatially resolved. Combined with the star formation rate surface
density traced by H$\alpha$ and 24 $\mu$m images, CO($J$=1-0) data provide a
super-linear slope of $N$ = 1.3. The slope becomes even steeper ($N$ = 1.8)
when the diffuse stellar and dust background emission is subtracted from the
H$\alpha$ and 24 $\mu$m images. In contrast to the recent results with
CO($J$=2-1) that found a constant star formation efficiency (SFE) in many
spiral galaxies, these results suggest that the SFE is not independent of
environment, but increases with molecular gas surface density. We suggest that
the excitation of CO($J$=2-1) is likely enhanced in the regions with higher
star formation and does not linearly trace the molecular gas mass. In addition,
the diffuse emission contaminates the SFE measurement most in regions where
star formation rate is law. These two effects can flatten the power law
correlation and produce the apparent linear slope. The super linear slope from
the CO($J$=1-0) analysis indicates that star formation is enhanced by
non-linear processes in regions of high gas density, e.g., gravitational
collapse and cloud-cloud collisions.

information processes involving continuous variable systems. That these two
notions are intimately related has been intuitively appreciated for quite some
time. An aspect of considerable interest is the behaviour of these attributes
of a state under the action of a noisy channel. Inspired by the notion of
entanglement-breaking channels, we define the concept of
nonclassicality-breaking channels in a natural manner. We show that the notion
of nonclassicality-breaking is essentially equivalent---in a clearly defined
sense of the phrase `essentially'---to the notion of entanglement-breaking, as
far as bosonic Gaussian channels are concerned. This is notwithstanding the
fact that the very notion of entanglement-breaking requires reference to a
bipartite system, whereas the definition of nonclassicality-breaking makes no
such reference. Our analysis rests on our classification of channels into
nonclassicality-based, as against entanglement-based, types of canonical forms.
Our result takes ones intuitive understanding of the close relationship between
nonclassicality and entanglement a step closer.

mediated by spin fluctuations between hole and electron bands. In this view,
multiband superconductivity would substantially differ from other systems like
MgB2, where pairing is predominantly intraband. Indeed, interband-dominated
pairing leads to the coexistence of bonding and antibonding superconducting
channels. Here we show that this has profound consequences on the nature of the
low-energy superconducting collective modes. In particular, the so-called
Leggett mode for phase fluctuations is absent in the usual two-band description
of pnictides. On the other hand, when also the repulsion between the hole bands
is taken into account, a more general three-band description should be used,
and a Leggett mode is then allowed. Such a model, that has been proposed for
strongly hole-doped 122 compounds, can also admit a low-temperature s+is phase
which breaks the time reversal symmetry. We show that the (quantum and thermal)
transition from the ordinary superconductor to the s+is state is accompanied by
the vanishing of the mass of Leggett-like phase fluctuations, regardless the
specific values of the interaction parameters. This general result can be
obtained by means of a generalized construction of the effective action for the
collective degrees of freedom that allows us also to deal with the non-trivial

therefore be able to distinguish between the rightful user and illegal users

  However, there is a limit to applying the same fixed standards to all card
users, since the transaction patterns of people differ and even individuals'

segments) defined on a simple cubic lattice are studied with the help of the
Wang-Landau Monte Carlo algorithm. The sampling process is performed using
pivot transformations starting from a given seed conformation. Both cases of
short-range attractive and repulsive interactions acting on the monomers are
considered. The properties of the specific energy, heat capacity and gyration
radius of several knots are discussed. It is found that the heat capacity
exhibits a sharp peak. If the interactions are attractive, similar peaks have
been observed also in single open chains and have been related to the
transition from a frozen crystallite state to an expanded coil state. Some
other peculiarities of the behavior of the analyzed observables are presented,
like for instance the increasing or decreasing of the knot specific energy at
high temperatures with increasing polymer lengths depending if the interactions
are attractive or repulsive. Besides the investigation of the thermodynamics of
polymer knots, the second goal of this paper is to introduce a method for
distinguishing the topology of a knot based on a topological invariant which is
in the form of multiple contour integrals and explicitly depends on the
physical trajectory of the knot. The chosen invariant is related to the second
coefficient of the Conway polynomial. It has been first isolated from the
amplitudes of a Chern-Simons field theory with gauge group SU(N). It is shown
that this invariant is very reliable in distinguishing the topology of polymer
knots. One of the advantages of the proposed approach is that it allows to
reduce the number of samples needed by the Wang-Landau algorithm. Some
solutions to speed up the calculations exploiting Monte Carlo integration
techniques are developed.

obtained using coronagraphs. But residual quasi-static aberrations create
speckles in the focal plane downstream of the coronagraph which mask the
planet. This problem appears in ground-based instruments as well as in
space-based telescopes. An active correction of these wavefront errors using a
deformable mirror upstream of the coronagraph is mandatory, but conventional
adaptive optics are limited by differential path aberrations. Dedicated
techniques have to be implemented to measure phase and amplitude errors
directly in the science focal plane. First, we propose a method for estimating
phase and amplitude aberrations upstream of a coronagraph from the speckle
complex field in the downstream focal plane. Then, we present the self-coherent
camera, which uses the coherence of light to spatially encode the focal plane
speckles and retrieve the associated complex field. This enable us to estimate
and compensate in a closed loop for the aberrations upstream of the
coronagraph. We conducted numerical simulations as well as laboratory tests
using a four-quadrant phase mask and a 32x32 actuator deformable mirror. We
demonstrated in the laboratory our capability to achieve a stable closed loop
and compensate for phase and amplitude quasi-static aberrations. We determined
the best-suited parameter values to implement our technique. Contrasts better
than 10-6 between 2 and 12 lambda/D and even 3.10-7 (RMS) between 7 and 11
lambda/D were reached in the focal plane. It seems that the contrast level is
mainly limited by amplitude defects created by the surface of the deformable
mirror and by the dynamic of the detector. These results are promising for a
future application to a dedicated space mission for exoplanet characterization.
A number of possible improvements have been identified.

where $c>0$ is a constant. This means that: (i) the energy per particle and
neutron density diverge rapidly for large neutron numbers; (ii) bound states of
$N$ neutrons exist for $N$ large enough. The neutron matter collapse is
possible due to the form of the repulsive core in three-body forces, which
vanishes when three nucleons occupy the same site in space. The old variant of
the forces Urbana VI, where the phenomenological repulsive core does not vanish
at the origin, resolves this problem. We prove that to prevent the collapse one
should add a repulsive term to the Urbana IX potential, which should be larger
than 50 MeV when 3 nucleons occupy the same spatial position.

Based on numerical calculations of coagulation starting from the typical grain
size distribution in the diffuse interstellar medium, we obtain a conservative
lower limit to the time $t$ to form micron-sized grains: $t/t_\mathrm{ff}>3
(5/S) (n_\mathrm{H}/10^5 \mathrm{cm}^{-3})^{-1/4}$ (where $t_\mathrm{ff}$ is
the free-fall time at hydrogen number density $n_\mathrm{H}$ in the core, and
$S$ the enhancement factor to the grain-grain collision cross-section to
account for non-compact aggregates). At the typical core density
$n_\mathrm{H}=10^5 \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, it takes at least a few free-fall times
to form the micron-sized grains responsible for coreshine. The implication is
that those dense cores observed in coreshine are relatively long-lived entities
in molecular clouds, rather than dynamically transient objects that last for

consistently measure the strength of the 4000 Angstrom spectral break

be resolved from broad-band photometry, and measurements from optical
spectroscopic surveys are typically limited to galaxies at least x10 more
massive. When combined with the rest-frame U-V colour, Dn(4000) provides a
powerful diagnostic of the extinction affecting the stellar population that is
relatively insensitive to degeneracies with age, metallicity or star formation
history. We use this novel approach to estimate de-reddened colours and
light-weighted stellar ages for individual sources. We explore the
relationships linking stellar mass, (U-V), and Dn(4000) for the sources in the

are: a) both Dn(4000) and (U-V) correlate with M*. The dispersion in Dn(4000)
values at a given M* increases with M*, while the dispersion for (U-V)
decreases due to the higher average extinction prevalent in massive
star-forming galaxies. b) for massive galaxies, we find a smooth transition
between the blue cloud and red sequence in the intrinsic U-V colour, in
contrast with other recent results. c) at a fixed stellar age, we find a
positive correlation between extinction and stellar mass. d) the fraction of
sources with declining or halted star formation increases steeply with the
stellar mass, from ~5% at log M*~9.0-9.5 to ~80% at log M*>11, in agreement
with downsizing scenarios.

application to grains which are small enough to qualify as dust. Consideration
of only the thermal aspects of this problem leads to the familiar conclusion
that such grains sublimate rapidly. Here we show that charging plays a critical
role in determining the sublimation rate, because an electric field helps to
bind molecules to the grain surface. A key aspect of the charging process is
that the conduction band of solid hydrogen lies above the vacuum free-electron
energy level, so low-energy electrons cannot penetrate the solid. But they are
attracted by the dielectric and by positive ions in the matrix, so they become
trapped in vacuum states just above the surface. This charge-separated
configuration suppresses recombination and permits overall neutrality, while
supporting large electric fields at the surface. Charging ceases when the
potential energy just outside the electron layer coincides with the conduction
band minimum. By that stage the heat of sublimation has increased tenfold,
effecting a huge reduction in the sublimation rate. Consequently hydrogen
grains may be able to survive indefinitely in the diffuse ISM. There are good
prospects for identifying H2 grains, if they exist, as fully localised surface
electrons should exhibit discrete energy levels, with a corresponding spectral
line signature.

Feedback Shift Registers (NLFSRs) in which both, feedback and feedforward,

In this paper, a new algorithm for constructing RNLUs generating a given binary
sequence is presented. Expected size of RNLUs constructed by the presented
algorithm is proved to be O(n/log(n/p)), where n is the sequence length and p
is the degree of parallelization. This is asymptotically smaller than the
expected size of RNLUs constructed by previous algorithms and the expected size

CECRT can be recovered efficiently. The required number of pairs of chosen
plaintext and the corresponding ciphertext is only $(1+\lceil (\log_2L)/l
\rceil)$. The attack complexity is only $O(L)$, where $L$ is the plaintext
length and $l$ is the number of bits representing a plaintext symbol. In
addition, other defects of CECRT such as invalid compression function and low
sensitivity to plaintext, are reported. The work in this paper will help
clarify positive role of CRT in cryptology.

on the rectangle $(x,y) \in (-1,1) \times (0,1)$ with an inverse square
potential. This model corresponds to the heat equation for the Laplace-Beltrami
operator associated to the Grushin metric on $\mathbb{R}^2$, studied by Boscain
and Laurent. The operator is both degenerate and singular on the line $\{ x=0
\}$.
  The approximate controllability is studied through unique continuation of the
adjoint system. For the range of singularity under study, approximate
controllability is proved to hold whatever the degeneracy is.
  Due to the internal inverse square singularity, a key point in this work is
the study of well-posedness. An extension of the singular operator is designed
imposing suitable transmission conditions through the singularity.
  Then, unique continuation relies on the Fourier decomposition of the 2D
solution in one variable and Carleman estimates for the 1D heat equation solved
by the Fourier components. The Carleman estimate uses a suitable Hardy
inequality.

standard quantum theory in which quantum state reduction is treated as a random
physical process which is incorporated into the Schr\""odinger equation in an
observer-independent way. These models make predictions in conflict with
standard quantum theory one of which is non conservation of energy. On the
basis of proposed relativistic extensions of SL it is argued that for a single
localized particle, non-relativistic SL should remain valid in the rest frame
of the particle. The implication is that relativistic calculations can be
performed by transforming non-relativistic results from the particle rest frame
to the frame of an inertial observer. This is demonstrated by considering a
relativistic stream of non-interacting particles of cosmological origin and
showing how their energy distribution evolves as a result of SL as they
traverse the Universe. A solution is presented and the potential for
astrophysical observations is discussed.

S. Braun et al. [Science 339,52 (2013)], where an attractively interacting
ensemble of ultracold atoms is investigated experimentally and found to
correspond to a negative-temperature system since the entropy decreases with
increasing energy at the high end of the energy spectrum. As the authors
suggest, it would be of interest to investigate whether a suitable
generalization of standard cosmological theory could be helpful, in order to
elucidate the observed accelerated expansion of the universe usually explained
in terms of a positive tensile stress (negative pressure). In the present note
we take up this basic idea and investigate a generalization of the standard
viscous cosmological theory, not by admitting negative temperatures but instead
by letting the bulk viscosity take negative values. Evidently, such an approach
breaks standard thermodynamics, but may actually be regarded to lead to the
same kind of bizarre consequences as the standard approach of admitting the
equation-of-state parameter w to be less than -1. In universe models dominated
by negative viscosity we find that the fluid's entropy decreases with time, as
one would expect. Moreover, we find that the fluid transition from the
quintessence region into the phantom region (thus passing the phantom divide
w=-1) can actually be reversed. Also in generalizations of the LCDM-universe
models with a fluid having negative bulk viscosity we find that the viscosity
decreases the expansion of the universe.

we model as a Gaussian, resulting in a best-fit sigma of sigma_S = (0.475 +/-
0.05) deg and an offset from Wd 1 of ~1 deg. A partial overlap of the GeV
emission with the TeV signal as reported by H.E.S.S. is found. We investigate
the spectral and morphological characteristics of the gamma-ray emission and
discuss its origin in the context of two distinct scenarios. Acceleration of
electrons in a Pulsar Wind Nebula provides a reasonably natural interpretation
of the GeV emission, but leaves the TeV emission unexplained. A scenario in
which protons are accelerated in or near Wd 1 in supernova explosion(s) and are
diffusing away and interacting with molecular material, seems consistent with
the observed GeV and TeV emission, but requires a very high energy input in
protons, ~10^51 erg, and rather slow diffusion. Observations of Wd 1 with a
future gamma-ray detector such as CTA provide a very promising route to fully
resolve the origin of the TeV and GeV emission in Wd 1 and provide a deeper

theories at the critical point in non-integer dimensions for the evolution

demonstrate that all constraints due the conformal symmetry are encoded in the
form of the generators of the collinear sl(2) subgroup. Two of them, S_- and
S_0, can be fixed at all loops in terms of the evolution kernel, while the
generator of special conformal transformations, S_+, receives nontrivial
corrections which can be calculated order by order in perturbation theory.
Provided that the generator S_+ is known at the k-1 loop order, one can fix the
evolution kernel in physical dimension to the k-loop accuracy up to terms that
are invariant with respect to the tree-level generators. The invariant parts
can easily be restored from the anomalous dimensions. The method is illustrated
on two examples: The O(n)-symmetric phi^4 theory in d=4 to the three-loop
accuracy, and the su(n) matrix phi^3 theory in d=6 to the two-loop accuracy. We

to lack a Brout-Englert-Higgs (BEH) fine-tuning problem due to quadratic
divergences, with finite Euclidean cut-off \Lambda, because of the symmetries
obeyed by all O(\Lambda^2) contributions. We extend those results to finite
contributions from certain M_{Heavy}^2>> m_{BEH}^2 particles in SO(2) versions
of GML and Schwinger. We demonstrate explicit 1-loop physical naturalness for
two SO(2) singlet examples: a heavy real scalar S and a right-handed Type 1
see-saw Majorana neutrino. We prove that for low |q^2| the heavy degrees of
freedom contribute, at worst, marginal operators in spontaneously broken SO(2)
Schwinger.
  The key GML lesson from these examples is that the pseudo Nambu-Goldstone
boson (NGB) mass-squared must be properly renormalized. A true NGB value, m_3^2
= 0, is then protected by the Goldstone theorem. For the Schwinger model, two
crucial observations emerge: global Ward-Takahashi identities (WTI) force all
relevant operators into the pseudo-NGB mass-squared; and WTI enforce the
Goldstone theorem by forbidding all relevant operator contributions in the
spontaneously broken Goldstone mode, \pi_3 is a massless NGB there. Goldstone
mode, with weak-scale m_{BEH}^2 \& <H>^2, is not-fine-tuned even as a
low-energy effective theory with certain high-mass-scale extensions. Its
""Goldstone Exceptional Naturalness (GEN),"" where all relevant operators vanish,
a powerful suppression of fine-tuning, is simply another (albeit un-familiar)
consequence of WTI, spontaneous symmetry breaking and the Goldstone theorem.
  If GEN can somehow be extended to the Standard Model (SM), there should be no
expectation that LHC will discover any Beyond the SM physics unrelated to
neutrino mixing, i.e. the only known experimentally necessary modification of
the Standard Model plus General Relativity paradigm.

was to be installed on the SuperB e+e- high luminosity collider. The SuperB
asymmetric collider, which was to be constructed on the Tor Vergata campus near
the INFN Frascati National Laboratory, was designed to operate both at the
Upsilon(4S) center-of-mass energy with a luminosity of 10^{36} cm^{-2}s^{-1}
and at the tau/charm production threshold with a luminosity of 10^{35}
cm^{-2}s^{-1}. This high luminosity, producing a data sample about a factor 100
larger than present B Factories, would allow investigation of new physics
effects in rare decays, CP Violation and Lepton Flavour Violation. This
document details the detector design presented in the Conceptual Design Report
(CDR) in 2007. The R&D and engineering studies performed to arrive at the full
detector design are described, and an updated cost estimate is presented.
  A combination of a more realistic cost estimates and the unavailability of
funds due of the global economic climate led to a formal cancelation of the
project on Nov 27, 2012.

assembly map that appears in the Baum-Connes conjecture. In its general form it
may be constructed using Kasparov's equivariant KK-theory. In the special case
of a torsionfree group the domain simplifies to the usual K-homology of the
classifying space BG of G and it is frequently used that in this case the
analytical assembly map is given by assigning to an operator an equivariant
index. We give a precise formulation of this statement and prove it.

certain non-compact spaces (families of manifolds with cocompact group action)
where the convergence of the heat operator at large time implies refined
L^2-index formulas. As applications, we prove a local L^2-index theorem for
families of signature operators and an L^2-Bismut-Lott theorem, expressing the
Becker-Gottlieb transfer of flat bundles in terms of Kamber-Tandeur classes.
With slightly stronger regularity we obtain the respective refined versions: we
construct L^2-eta forms and L^2-torsion forms as transgression forms.

temperatures and densities seen by the bosons and compare to similar
calculations for fermions. The resulting energy densities agree rather well
with each other and with the one derived from neutrons. This suggests that a
common phenomenon, such as the sudden opening of many reaction channels and/or
a liquid gas phase transition, is responsible for the agreement.

shape descriptor of the ROI has to be described in terms of its boundary
characteristics. To address the generic issues of contour tracking, the yConvex
Hypergraph (yCHG) model was proposed by Kanna et al [1]. In this work, we
propose a parallel approach to implement the yCHG model by exploiting massively
parallel cores of NVIDIA's Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). We
perform our experiments on the MODIS satellite image database by NASA, and
based on our analysis we observe that the performance of the serial
implementation is better on smaller images, but once the threshold is achieved
in terms of image resolution, the parallel implementation outperforms its
sequential counterpart by 2 to 10 times (2x-10x). We also conclude that an
increase in the number of hyperedges in the ROI of a given size does not impact
the performance of the overall algorithm.

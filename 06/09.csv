is modeled here as a binary hypercube of dimension $L$, to the real numbers. We
consider random models of fitness landscapes, where fitness values are assigned
according to some probabilistic rule, and study the statistical properties of
pathways to the global fitness maximum along which fitness increases
monotonically. Such paths are important for evolution because they are the only
ones that are accessible to an adapting population when mutations occur at a
low rate. The focus of this work is on the block model introduced by A.S.
Perelson and C.A. Macken [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92:9657 (1995)] where the
genome is decomposed into disjoint sets of loci (`modules') that contribute
independently to fitness, and fitness values within blocks are assigned at
random. We show that the number of accessible paths can be written as a product
of the path numbers within the blocks, which provides a detailed analytic
description of the path statistics. The block model can be viewed as a special
case of Kauffman's NK-model, and we compare the analytic results to simulations
of the NK-model with different genetic architectures. We find that the mean
number of accessible paths in the different versions of the model are quite
similar, but the distribution of the path number is qualitatively different in
the block model due to its multiplicative structure. A similar statement
applies to the number of local fitness maxima in the NK-models, which has been
studied extensively in previous works. The overall evolutionary accessibility
of the landscape, as quantified by the probability to find at least one
accessible path to the global maximum, is dramatically lowered by the modular
structure.

possibilities are allowed. In order to generate such terms systematically we
start with a formulation for a spinning particle in VSR. It is then coupled
minimally to the electromagnetic field and a gyromagnetic factor is added to

four-dimensional hypersurface, we classify the energy-momentum tensor into two
parts in a way that, one part represents all kind of the matter (the baryonic
and dark) and the other one contains every extra terms emerging from the scale
factor of the fifth dimension and the scalar field, which we consider as the
energy-momentum tensor of dark energy. We also separate the energy-momentum
conservation equation into two conservation equations, one for matter and the
other for dark energy. We perform this procedure for different cases, without
interacting term and with two particular (suitable) interacting terms between
the two parts. By assuming the parameter of the state equation for dark energy
to be constant, the equations of the model admit the power-law solutions.
Though, the non-interacting case does not give any accelerated universe, but
the interacting cases give both decelerated and accelerated universes. For the
interacting cases, we figure out analytically the acceptable ranges of some
parameters of the model, and also investigate the data analysis to test the
model parameter values consistency with the observational data of the distance
modulus of 580 SNe Ia compiled in Union2.1. For one of these interacting cases,
the best fitted values suggest that the Brans-Dicke coupling constant
({\omega}) is -7.75, however, it also gives the state parameter of dark energy
(wX) equal to -0.67. In addition, the model gives the Hubble and deceleration

the spin waves. The partition function is evaluated and various thermodynamic

repulsive at low temperatures, its magnitude depending on the strength of the

problem of two mobile computational entities, called robots, in the plane. It
is well known that, without additional assumptions, rendezvous is impossible if
the entities are oblivious (i.e., have no persistent memory) even if the system
is semi-synchronous (SSynch). It has been recently shown that rendezvous is
possible even if the system is asynchronous (ASynch) if each robot is endowed
with O(1) bits of persistent memory, can transmit O(1) bits in each cycle, and
can remember (i.e., can persistently store) the last received transmission.
This setting is overly powerful.
  In this paper we weaken that setting in two different ways: (1) by
maintaining the O(1) bits of persistent memory but removing the communication
capabilities; and (2) by maintaining the O(1) transmission capability and the
ability to remember the last received transmission, but removing the ability of
an agent to remember its previous activities. We call the former setting
finite-state (FState) and the latter finite-communication (FComm). Note that,
even though its use is very different, in both settings, the amount of
persistent memory of a robot is constant.
  We investigate the rendezvous problem in these two weaker settings. We model
both settings as a system of robots endowed with visible lights: in FState, a
robot can only see its own light, while in FComm a robot can only see the other
robot's light. We prove, among other things, that finite-state robots can
rendezvous in SSynch, and that finite-communication robots are able to
rendezvous even in ASynch. All proofs are constructive: in each setting, we
present a protocol that allows the two robots to rendezvous in finite time.

containing a single type of coupled dynamical component (e.g., coupled
oscillators or coupled switches), systems containing diverse components (e.g.,
both oscillators and switches) have received much less attention. We analyze
large, hybrid systems of interconnected Kuramoto oscillators and Hopfield
switches with positive feedback. In this system, oscillator synchronization
promotes switches to turn on. In turn, when switches turn on they enhance the
synchrony of the oscillators to which they are coupled. Depending on the choice
of parameters, we find theoretically coexisting stable solutions with either
(i) incoherent oscillators and all switches permanently off, (ii) synchronized
oscillators and all switches permanently on, or (iii) synchronized oscillators
and switches that periodically alternate between the on and off states.
Numerical experiments confirm these predictions. We discuss how transitions
between these steady state solutions can be onset deterministically through
dynamic bifurcations or spontaneously due to finite-size fluctuations.

eigenvalue problem of second-order elliptic operators subject to the Dirichlet
boundary condition. The focus is on the preservation of basic properties of the
principal eigenvalue and eigenfunctions of continuous problems. It is shown
that when the stiffness matrix is an irreducible $M$-matrix, the algebraic
eigenvalue problem maintains those properties such as the smallest eigenvalue
being real and simple and the corresponding eigenfunctions being either
positive or negative inside the physical domain. Mesh conditions leading to
such a stiffness matrix are also studied. A sufficient condition is that the
mesh is simplicial, acute when measured in the metric specified by the inverse
of the diffusion matrix, and interiorly connected. The acute requirement can be
replaced by the Delaunay condition in two dimensions. Numerical results are
presented to verify the theoretical findings.

lengthscales estimated from an initial fit. Weighting dimensions according to
lengthscales, this downweights variables of little relevance, leading to
automatic variable selection and improved prediction. Third, we introduce a
technique for accelerating convergence in nonconjugate variational message
passing by adapting step sizes in the direction of the natural gradient of the

based on the phonon or orbital fluctuation mediated pairing. In the

position as a remote imaging method. However, PolSAR images are contaminated by
speckle noise due to the coherent illumination employed during the data
acquisition. This noise provides a granular aspect to the image, making its
processing and analysis (such as in edge detection) hard tasks. This paper
discusses seven methods for edge detection in multilook PolSAR images. In all
methods, the basic idea consists in detecting transition points in the finest
possible strip of data which spans two regions. The edge is contoured using the
transitions points and a B-spline curve. Four stochastic distances, two
differences of entropies, and the maximum likelihood criterion were used under
the scaled complex Wishart distribution; the first six stem from the h-phi
class of measures. The performance of the discussed detection methods was
quantified and analyzed by the computational time and probability of correct
edge detection, with respect to the number of looks, the backscatter matrix as
a whole, the SPAN, the covariance an the spatial resolution. The detection
procedures were applied to three real PolSAR images. Results provide evidence
that the methods based on the Bhattacharyya distance and the difference of
Shannon entropies outperform the other techniques.

  Backoff Rate",,,,,"cs.NI cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent studies on MAC scheduling have shown that carrier sense multiple
access (CSMA) algo- rithms can be throughput optimal for arbitrary wireless
network topology. However, these results are highly sensitive to the underlying
assumption on 'static' or 'fixed' system conditions. For example, if channel
conditions are time-varying, it is unclear how each node can adjust its CSMA
parameters, so-called backoff and channel holding times, using its local
channel information for the desired high performance. In this paper, we study
'channel-aware' CSMA (A-CSMA) algorithms in time-varying channels, where they
adjust their parameters as some function of the current channel capacity.
First, we show that the achievable rate region of A-CSMA equals to the maximum
rate region if and only if the function is exponential. Furthermore, given an
exponential function in A-CSMA, we design updating rules for their parameters,
which achieve throughput optimality for an arbitrary wireless network topology.
They are the first CSMA algorithms in the literature which are proved to be
throughput optimal under time-varying channels. Moreover, we also consider the
case when back-off rates of A- CSMA are highly restricted compared to the speed
of channel variations, and characterize the throughput performance of A-CSMA in
terms of the underlying wireless network topology. Our results not only guide a
high-performance design on MAC scheduling under highly time-varying scenarios,
but also provide new insights on the performance of CSMA algorithms in relation
to their backoff rates and the network topology.

optimal capacity scaling at high SNR in interference networks. Most of the
existing IA designs require full channel state information (CSI) at the
transmitters, which induces a huge CSI signaling cost. Hence it is desirable to
improve the feedback efficiency for IA and in this paper, we propose a novel IA
scheme with a significantly reduced CSI feedback. To quantify the CSI feedback
cost, we introduce a novel metric, namely the feedback dimension. This metric
serves as a first-order measurement of CSI feedback overhead. Due to the
partial CSI feedback constraint, conventional IA schemes can not be applied and
hence, we develop a novel IA precoder / decorrelator design and establish new
IA feasibility conditions. Via dynamic feedback profile design, the proposed IA
scheme can also achieve a flexible tradeoff between the degree of freedom (DoF)
requirements for data streams, the antenna resources and the CSI feedback cost.
We show by analysis and simulations that the proposed scheme achieves
substantial reductions of CSI feedback overhead under the same DoF requirement
in MIMO interference networks.

between SDEs and RDEs driven by G-Brownian motion. As an application, we
introduce the notion of SDEs on a differentiable manifold driven by GBrownian

extension to the theory of bounded rationality is revisited. Rational decision
making involves using information which is almost always imperfect and
incomplete together with some intelligent machine which if it is a human being
is inconsistent to make decisions. In bounded rationality, this decision is
made irrespective of the fact that the information to be used is incomplete and
imperfect and that the human brain is inconsistent and thus this decision that
is to be made is taken within the bounds of these limitations. In the theory of
flexibly-bounded rationality, advanced information analysis is used, the
correlation machine is applied to complete missing information and artificial
intelligence is used to make more consistent decisions. Therefore
flexibly-bounded rationality expands the bounds within which rationality is
exercised. Because human decision making is essentially irrational, this paper
proposes the theory of marginalization of irrationality in decision making to
deal with the problem of satisficing in the presence of irrationality.

afterglow exhibits weak CaII absorption features but negligible emission
features. The explosion site therefore lacks evidence of recent star formation,
consistent with the relatively long delay time distribution expected in a
compact binary merger scenario. The star formation rate (both in an absolute
sense and normalized to the luminosity) and metallicity of the host are both
consistent with the known sample of short-duration GRB hosts and with recent
results which suggest GRB130603B emission to be the product of the decay of
radioactive species produced during the merging process of a NS-NS binary
(""kilonova"").
  Ultimately, the discovery of more events similar to GRB130603B and their
rapid follow-up from 8-m class telescopes will open new opportunities for our
understanding of the final stages of compact-objects binary systems.

development of a successful vaccine against AIDS, whose causative agent is HIV,
a highly mutable virus. Knowing the virus' fitness as a function of its
proteomic sequence can enable rational design of potent vaccines, as this
information can focus vaccine induced immune responses to target mutational
vulnerabilities of the virus. Spin models have been proposed as a means to
infer intrinsic fitness landscapes of HIV proteins from patient-derived viral
protein sequences. These sequences are the product of non-equilibrium viral
evolution driven by patient-specific immune responses, and are subject to
phylogenetic constraints. How can such sequence data allow inference of
intrinsic fitness landscapes? We combined computer simulations and variational
theory \'{a} la Feynman to show that, in most circumstances, spin models
inferred from patient-derived viral sequences reflect the correct rank order of
the fitness of mutant viral strains. Our findings are relevant for diverse
viruses.

and the most numerous massive stars. It is host to a variety of supernova
progenitors and is therefore very important for galactic chemical evolution and
stellar population studies. In this paper, we study the transition from
super-AGB star to massive star and find that a propagating neon-oxygen burning
shell is common to both the most massive electron capture supernova (EC-SN)
progenitors and the lowest mass iron-core collapse supernova (FeCCSN)
progenitors. Of the models that ignite neon burning off-center, the 9.5Mo model
would evolve to an FeCCSN after the neon-burning shell propagates to the
center, as in previous studies. The neon-burning shell in the 8.8Mo model,
however, fails to reach the center as the URCA process and an extended (0.6 Mo)
region of low Ye (0.48) in the outer part of the core begin to dominate the
late evolution; the model evolves to an EC-SN. This is the first study to
follow the most massive EC-SN progenitors to collapse, representing an
evolutionary path to EC-SN in addition to that from SAGB stars undergoing
thermal pulses. We also present models of an 8.75Mo super-AGB star through its
entire thermal pulse phase until electron captures on 20Ne begin at its center
and of a 12Mo star up to the iron core collapse. We discuss key uncertainties
and how the different pathways to collapse affect the pre-supernova structure.
Finally, we compare our results to the observed neutron star mass distribution.

where R is rare-earth ion, are still issues under debate. In this work, the
temperature-dependent electric polarization of DyMn2O5, the most attractive
member of this RMn2O5 family, is investigated using the pyroelectric current
method upon varying endpoint temperature of the electric cooling, plus the
positive-up-negative-down (PUND) technique. It is revealed that DyMn2O5 at low
temperature does exhibit the unusual ferrielectricity rather than
ferroelectricity, characterized by two interactive and anti-parallel
ferroelectric sublattices which show different temperature-dependences. The two
ferroelectric sublattices are believed to be generated from the symmetric
exchange-striction mechanisms associated with the Mn-Mn spin interactions and
Dy-Mn spin interactions, respectively. The path-dependent electric polarization
reflects the first-order magnetic transitions in the low temperature regime.
The magnetoelectric effect is mainly attributed to the Dy spin order which is
sensitive to magnetic field. The present experiments may be helpful for
clarifying the puzzling issues on the multiferroicity in DyMn2O5 and probably
other RMn2O5 multiferroics.

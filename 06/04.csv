identical, independent and drawn from a distribution \phi(\eta) displaying
asymmetric power law tails (i.e. \phi(\eta) \sim c/\eta^{\alpha +1} for large
positive jumps and \phi(\eta) \sim c/(\gamma |\eta|^{\alpha +1}) for large
negative jumps, with 0 < \alpha < 2). In absence of boundaries and after a
large number of steps n, the probability density function (PDF) of the walker
position, x_n, converges to an asymmetric L\'evy stable law of stability index
\alpha and skewness parameter \beta=(\gamma-1)/(\gamma+1). In particular the
right tail of this PDF decays as c n/x_n^{1+\alpha}. Much less is known when
the walker is confined, or partially confined, in a region of the space. In
this paper we first study the case of a walker constrained to move on the
positive semi-axis and absorbed once it changes sign. In this case, the
persistence exponent \theta_+, which characterizes the algebraic large time
decay of the survival probability, can be computed exactly and we show that the
tail of the PDF of the walker position decays as c \, n/[(1-\theta_+) \,
x_n^{1+\alpha}]. This last result can be generalized in higher dimensions such
as a planar L\'evy walker confined in a wedge with absorbing walls. Our results
are corroborated by precise numerical simulations.

discovery by C.R. Rao of the geometric meaning of the Fisher information. Most
of the research is focused on parametric statistical models. In series of
papers by author and coworkers a particular version of the nonparametric case
has been discussed. It consists of a minimalistic structure modeled according
the theory of exponential families: given a reference density other densities
are represented by the centered log likelihood which is an element of an Orlicz
space. This mappings give a system of charts of a Banach manifold. It has been
observed that, while the construction is natural, the practical applicability
is limited by the technical difficulty to deal with such a class of Banach
spaces. It has been suggested recently to replace the exponential function with
other functions with similar behavior but polynomial growth at infinity in
order to obtain more tractable Banach spaces, e.g. Hilbert spaces. We give
first a review of our theory with special emphasis on the specific issues of
the infinite dimensional setting. In a second part we discuss two specific
topics, differential equations and the metric connection. The position of this
line of research with respect to other approaches is briefly discussed.

in the presence of a general background metric. Using constraints from global
Weyl scaling and three-space general coordinate transformations, we show that
to zeroth order in derivatives of the metric, the induced gravitational action

the form $$ \Delta S=\int d^4x (^{(4)}g)^{1/2}(g_{00})^{-2} A\big(g_{0i} g_{0j}

valence electron-energy loss spectroscopy and ab initio calculation at the

(LFE). A meticulous comparison between experimental and calculated spectra is
performed in order to interpret calculated dielectric properties. The
dielectric function of MoO3 has been obtained along the three axes and the
importance of LFE has been shown. In particular, taking into account LFE is
shown to be essential to describe properly the intensity and position of the
Mo-N2,3 edges as well as the low energy part of the spectrum. A detailed study
of the energy-loss function in connection with the dielectric response function
also shows that the strong anisotropy of the energy-loss function of
{\alpha}-MoO3 is driven by an anisotropic influence of LFE. These LFE
significantly dampen a large peak in {\epsilon}2, but only along the [010]
direction. Thanks to a detailed analysis at specific k-points of the orbitals
involved in this transition, the origin of this peak has not only been
evidenced but a connection between the inhomogeneity of the electron density
and the anisotropic influence of local-field effects has also been established.
More specifically, this anisotropy is governed by a strongly inhomogeneous
spatial distribution of the empty states. This depletion of the empty states is
localized around the terminal oxygens and accentuates the electron
inhomogeneity.

and phase flip-syndromes be measured separately. To comply with fault tolerant

repeated allowing for flexibility in the order of their implementation. We
examine different possible orders of Shor state and Steane state syndrome

best choice of syndrome order, determined by the fidelity of the state after
noisy error correction, will depend on the error environment. We also compare
the fidelity when syndrome measurements are done with Shor states versus Steane
states and find that Steane states generally, but not always, lead to final

  MIMO-OFDM",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Performing link adaptation in a multiantenna and multiuser system is
challenging because of the coupling between precoding, user selection, spatial
mode selection and use of limited feedback about the channel. The problem is
exacerbated by the difficulty of selecting the proper modulation and coding
scheme when using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). This paper
presents a data-driven approach to link adaptation for multiuser multiple input
mulitple output (MIMO) OFDM systems. A machine learning classifier is used to
select the modulation and coding scheme, taking as input the SNR values in the
different subcarriers and spatial streams. A new approximation is developed to
estimate the unknown interuser interference due to the use of limited feedback.
This approximation allows to obtain SNR information at the transmitter with a
minimum communication overhead. A greedy algorithm is used to perform spatial
mode and user selection with affordable complexity, without resorting to an
exhaustive search. The proposed adaptation is studied in the context of the
IEEE 802.11ac standard, and is shown to schedule users and adjust the
transmission parameters to the channel conditions as well as to the rate of the
feedback channel.

of the II-VI zincblende or wurtzite semiconductors, obtained by starting from
four unit cells of (II-VI) and replacing four type II atoms by three type I and
one type V atoms. In trying to understand their electronic structures and
transport properties, some fundamental questions arise: whether V atoms are
indeed pentavalent and if not how do these compounds become semiconductors,
what is the role of V lone pair electrons in the origin of band gaps, and what
are the general characteristics of states near the valence band maxima and the
conduction band minima. We answer some of these questions using ab initio

We verified this new technique measuring the contact angle on a cylinder,
rotating partially immersed in a liquid. A laser sheet is inclined under an
angle $\varphi$ to the unperturbed liquid surface and is reflected off the
meniscus. Collected on a screen, the reflection image contains information to
determine the contact angle. When dividing the laser sheet into an array of
laser rays by placing a mesh into the beam path, the shape of the meniscus can
be reconstructed from the reflection image. We verified the method by measuring
the receding contact angle versus speed for aqueous cetyltrimethyl ammonium
bromide solutions on a smooth hydrophobized as well as on a rough polystyrene

HCN enhancement with respect to HCO+ and CO in the low-J transitions, which
seems to be a common characteristic in AGN environments. Using the ALMA data,
we study the characteristics of the dense gas around this AGN and search for
the mechanism of HCN enhancement. We find a high HCN (J=4-3) to HCO+ (J=4-3)
line ratio in the nucleus. The upper limit of the brightness temperature ratio
of HCN (v2=1^{1f}, J=4-3) to HCN (J=4-3) is 0.08, which indicates that IR
pumping does not significantly affect the pure rotational population in this
nucleus. We also find a higher HCN (J=4-3) to CS (J=7-6) line ratio in NGC 1097
than in starburst galaxies, which is more than 12.7 on the brightness
temperature scale. Combined from similar observations from other galaxies, we
tentatively suggest that this ratio appears to be higher in AGN-host galaxies
than in pure starburst ones similar to the widely used HCN to HCO+ ratio. LTE
and non-LTE modeling of the observed HCN and HCO+ lines using J=4-3 and 1-0
data from ALMA, and J=3-2 data from SMA, reveals a high HCN to HCO+ abundance
ratio (5 < [HCN]/[HCO+] < 20: non-LTE analysis) in the nucleus, and that the
high-J lines (J=4-3 and 3-2) are emitted from dense (10^{4.5} < n_H2 [/cc] <
10^6), hot (70 < Tkin [K] < 550) regions. Finally we propose that the high

Joseph (2008) adapted pairs for every truncated biparabolic subalgebra
$\mathfrak q_{\Lambda}$ of a simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ of type $A$ were
constructed and then provide Weierstrass sections for $Y(\mathfrak

subvarieties $\eta+V$ of $\mathfrak q_{\Lambda}^*$ such that the restriction
map induces an algebra isomorphism of $Y(\mathfrak q_{\Lambda})$ onto the

express $\eta$ as the image of a regular nilpotent element $y$ of $\mathfrak

translate of the standard regular nilpotent element defined in terms of the
already chosen set $\pi$ of simple roots, one may attach to $y$ a unique
element of the Weyl group. Ultimately one can then hope to be able to describe

in detail to what extent this cross-correlation method can mitigate loss of
cosmological information in upcoming weak lensing surveys (combined with a CMB
prior) due to lack of knowledge of the source distribution. We consider a
scenario where photometric redshifts are available, and find that, unless the
photometric redshift distribution p(z_{ph}|z) is calibrated very accurately a
priori (bias and scatter known to ~0.002 for, e.g., EUCLID), the additional
constraint on p(z_{ph}|z) from the cross correlation technique to a large
extent restores the cosmological information originally lost due to the
uncertainty in dn/dz(z). Considering only the gain in photo-z accuracy and not
the additional cosmological information, enhancements of the dark energy figure
of merit of up to a factor of 4 (40) can be achieved for a SuMIRe (Subaru
Measurement of Images and Redshifts, the combination of the Hyper Suprime Cam
lensing survey and the Prime Focus Spectrograph redshift survey)-like
(EUCLID-like) combination of lensing and redshift surveys. However, the success
of the method is strongly sensitive to our knowledge of the galaxy bias
evolution in the source sample. If this bias is modeled by a free parameter in
each of a large number of redshift bins, we find that a prior of order 0.01 is
needed on b_i \sqrt{\Delta z} in each redshift slice (where \Delta z is the bin
width and b_i the value of the galaxy bias in the i-th source bin) to optimize
the gains from the cross-correlation method (i.e. to approach the cosmology
constraints attainable if the bias were known exactly).[abridged]

group of the spacetime manifold $X$ of string theory and D-branes in string

equivalence class of $K$-cycles $[M,E,\phi]$, where $M$ is a closed spin$^c$
manifold, $E$ is a complex vector bundle over $M$, and $\phi: M\rightarrow X$
is a continuous map. It is proposed that a $K$-cycle $[M,E,\phi]$ represents a
D-brane configuration wrapping the subspace $\phi(M)$. As a consequence, the
$K$-homology element defined by $[M,E,\phi]$ represents a class of D-brane
configurations that have the same physical charge. Furthermore, the $K$-cycle
representation of D-branes resembles the modern way of characterizing
fundamental strings, in which the strings are represented as two-dimensional
surfaces with maps into the spacetime manifold. This classification of D-branes
also suggests the possibility of physically interpreting D-branes wrapping
singular subspaces of spacetime, enlarging the known types of singularities

There are different approaches to achieve topological stability or active error

color codes. The stability of these proposals against noise can be quantified
by their error threshold. This figure of merit can be computed by mapping the
problem onto complex statistical-mechanical spin-glass models with local
disorder on nontrival lattices that can have many-body interactions and are
sometimes described by lattice gauge theories. The error threshold for a given

clouds. We here focus on the high-density parts of W43, a molecular cloud
undergoing an efficient event of formation. The cloud structure is studied with
a column density image derived from Herschel continuum maps obtained at 70,
160, 250, 350, and 500 micron. We identify two high-column density filamentary
clouds, quoted as the W43-MM1 and W43-MM2 ridges, which both account for
1.5x10^4 Msun gas mass above 10^23 cm-2 and within areas of 5 and 14pc^2,
respectively. We used the N_2H^+ 1--0 line to confirm that the W43-MM1 and
W43-MM2 ridges are structures coherent in velocity and gravitationally bound,
despite their large velocity dispersion and ~5 kms line widths. The most
intriguing result of the W43 large program is the bright wide-spread SiO 2--1
emission: 1--11 K kms$ stretching an area of ~28 pc^2. Concentrated toward the
W43-MM1 and W43-MM2 ridges and their immediate surroundings, it leads to a
total luminosity of L_SiO 2-1 ~4 10^4 K kms kpc^2pc^2. We measured a steep
relation between the luminosity and velocity extent of the SiO~2--1 lines and
propose to use it to distinguish the low-velocity shocks observed here from the
more classical high-velocity ones associated with outflows of high-mass young
stellar objects. We used state-of-the-art shock models to demonstrate that
low-velocity (<10 kms^-1) shocks with a small amount (10%) of Si atoms
initially in gas phase or in grain mantles can explain the observed SiO column
density in W43. The spatial and velocity overlaps between the ridges
high-density gas (n_H2>10^4-10^5 cm^-3) and the shocked SiO gas suggests that
ridges could be forming via colliding flows driven by gravity and accompanied
by low-velocity shocks. This mechanism may be the initial conditions for the
formation of young massive clusters in these ridges.

hampered by the presence of non-gravitational forces that can neither be
calculated nor separately measured. Among these spurious forces is
electrostatic attraction between a test mass and its surroundings due to the
presence of spatially varying surface potential known as the ""patch effect."" In
order to make surfaces with small surface potential variation, it is necessary
to be able to measure it. A Kelvin probe (KP) measures contact potential
difference (CPD), using the time-varying capacitance between the sample and a
vibrating tip that is biased with a backing potential. Assuming that the tip
remains constant, this measures the sample's surface potential variation. We
examine the operation of the KP from the perspective of parameter estimation in
the presence of noise. We show that, when the CPD is estimated from
measurements at two separate backing potentials, the standard deviation of the
optimal estimate depends on the total observing time. Further, the observing
time may be unevenly divided between the two backing potentials, provided the
values of those potentials are correspondingly set. We simulate a two-stage KP
data analysis, including a sub-optimal estimator with advantages for real-time
operation. Based on the real-time version, we present a novel approach to
stabilizing the average distance of the tip from the sample. We also present
the results of a series of covariance analyses that validate and bound the
applicability of the suboptimal estimator, make a comparison with the results
of an optimal estimator and guide the user. We discuss the application of the
KP to the LISA and to a test of the weak equivalence principle.

preventing eavesdropping in an open wireless medium. In this paper, we propose
a novel waveform design approach to minimize the likelihood that a message
transmitted between trusted single-antenna nodes is intercepted by an
eavesdropper. In particular, with knowledge first of the eavesdropper's channel
state information (CSI), we find the optimum waveform and transmit energy that
minimize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the output of
the eavesdropper's maximum-SINR linear filter, while at the same time provide
the intended receiver with a required pre-specified SINR at the output of its
own max-SINR filter. Next, if prior knowledge of the eavesdropper's CSI is
unavailable, we design a waveform that maximizes the amount of energy available
for generating disturbance to eavesdroppers, termed artificial noise (AN),
while the SINR of the intended receiver is maintained at the pre-specified
level. The extensions of the secure waveform design problem to multiple
intended receivers are also investigated and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) -an
approximation technique based on convex optimization- is utilized to solve the
arising NP-hard design problems. Extensive simulation studies confirm our
analytical performance predictions and illustrate the benefits of the designed
waveforms on securing single-input single-output (SISO) transmissions and

upwards. Therefore, it only requires knowledge of the bivariate distribution of
the walk height and slope, and is particularly useful for excursion set models
of the massive end of the halo mass function. However, it diverges at lower
masses. We show how to cure this divergence by using a formulation which
requires knowledge of just one other variable. While our analysis is general,
we use examples based on Gaussian initial conditions to illustrate our results.
Our formulation, which is simple and fast, yields excellent agreement with the

Caribbean populations on a sub-continental level and unveil fine-scale patterns
of population structure distinguishing insular from mainland Caribbean
populations as well as from other Hispanic/Latino groups. We provide genetic
evidence for an inland South American origin of the Native American component
in island populations and for extensive pre-Columbian gene flow across the
Caribbean basin. The Caribbean-derived European component shows significant
differentiation from parental Iberian populations, presumably as a result of
founder effects during the colonization of the New World. Based on demographic
models, we reconstruct the complex population history of the Caribbean since
the onset of continental admixture. We find that insular populations are best
modeled as mixtures absorbing two pulses of African migrants, coinciding with
early and maximum activity stages of the transatlantic slave trade. These two
pulses appear to have originated in different regions within West Africa,
imprinting two distinguishable signatures in present day Afro-Caribbean genomes
and shedding light on the genetic impact of the dynamics occurring during the

shock breakout radiation pulse even in daytime (~64% for the cheapest design).
Neutrino experiments should seriously consider adding such systems, both for
their scientific return and as an added and internal layer of protection
against false triggers. We find that shock breakouts from failed ccSNe of red
supergiants may be more observable than those of successful SNe. We review the
process by which neutrinos from a Galactic ccSN would be detected and
announced. We provide new information on the EGADS system and its potential for

very powerful tool to constrain dark matter annihilation at the epoch of
recombination. However, CMB constraints are currently derived using a number of
reasonable but yet un-tested assumptions that could potentially lead to a
misestimation of the true bounds. In this paper we examine the potential impact
of these systematic effects. In particular, we separately study the propagation
of the secondary particles produced by annihilation in two energy regimes;
first following the shower from the initial particle energy to the keV scale,
and then tracking the resulting secondary particles from this scale to the
absorption of their energy as heat, ionization, or excitation of the medium. We
improve both the high and low energy parts of the calculation, in particular
finding that our more accurate treatment of losses to sub-10.2 eV photons
produced by scattering of high-energy electrons weakens the constraints on
particular DM annihilation models by up to a factor of two. On the other hand,
we find that the uncertainties we examine for the low energy propagation do not
significantly affect the results for current and upcoming CMB data. We include
the evaluation of the precise amount of excitation energy, in the form of
Lyman-alpha photons, produced by the propagation of the shower, and examine the
effects of varying the Helium fraction and Helium ionization fraction. In the
recent literature, simple approximations for the fraction of energy absorbed in
different channels have often been used to derive CMB constraints: we assess
the impact of using accurate versus approximate energy fractions. Finally we
check that the choice of recombination code (between RECFAST v1.5 and
COSMOREC), to calculate the evolution of the free electron fraction in the
presence of dark matter annihilation, introduces negligible differences.

this matter is initially far from equilibrium, we find that the equilibrium
expression for heavy quark energy loss in a homogeneous strongly coupled plasma
with the same instantaneous energy density or pressure as that at the location
of the quark describes many qualitative features of our results. One
interesting exception is that there is a time delay after the initial collision
before the heavy quark energy loss becomes significant. At later times, once a
liquid plasma described by viscous hydrodynamics has formed, expressions based
upon assuming instantaneous homogeneity and equilibrium provide a
semi-quantitative description of our results - as long as the rapidity of the
heavy quark is not too large. For a heavy quark with large rapidity, the
gradients in the velocity of the hydrodynamic fluid result in qualitative
consequences for the 'drag' force acting on the quark. In certain
circumstances, the force required to drag the quark through the plasma can
point opposite to the velocity of the quark, meaning that the force that the
plasma exerts on a quark moving through it acts in the same direction as its
velocity. And, generically, the force includes a component perpendicular to the
direction of motion of the quark. Our results support a straightforward
approach to modeling the drag on, and energy loss of, heavy quarks with modest
rapidity in heavy ion collisions, both before and after the quark-gluon plasma
hydrodynamizes, and provide cautionary lessons at higher rapidity.

Tightly-packed Inner Planets (STIPs). The current paradigm for planet formation
suggests that small planetesimals will quickly spiral into the host star due to
aerodynamic drag, preventing rocky planet formation. In contrast, we find that
aerodynamic drift, when acting on an ensemble of solids, can concentrate mass
at short orbital periods in gaseous disks. Sublimation fronts may further aid
this process. Kepler data suggest that the innermost known planets are found
near the silicate sublimation zone. STIP planets should have a wide range of
volatile fractions due to aerodynamic drift and H2 dissociation-driven gas
accretion. We further propose that the low mass of Mars is evidence that the
Solar System was once a proto-STIP.

spiral into their host stars. Although the timescale for orbital decay is very
uncertain, it should be faster for systems with larger and more evolved stars.
Indeed, it is well established that hot Jupiters are found less frequently
around subgiant stars than around main-sequence stars. However, the
interpretation of this finding has been ambiguous, because the subgiants are
also thought to be more massive than the F- and G-type stars that dominate the
main-sequence sample. Consequently it has been unclear whether the absence of
hot Jupiters is due to tidal destruction, or inhibited formation of those
planets around massive stars. Here we show that the Galactic space motions of
the planet-hosting subgiant stars demand that on average they be similar in
mass to the planet-hosting main-sequence F- and G-type stars. Therefore the two
samples are likely to differ only in age, and provide a glimpse of the same
exoplanet population both before and after tidal evolution. As a result, the
lack of hot Jupiters orbiting subgiants is clear evidence for their tidal
destruction. Questions remain, though, about the interpretation of other
reported differences between the planet populations around subgiants and
main-sequence stars, such as their period and eccentricity distributions and
overall occurrence rates.

planet formation theories. Formation in situ from disks with radial mass

We propose that a more natural way to create these planets in the inner disk is
formation sequentially from the inside-out via creation of successive
gravitationally unstable rings fed from a continuous stream of small (~cm--m
size) ""pebbles"", drifting inwards via gas drag. Pebbles collect at the pressure
maximum associated with the transition from a magneto-rotational instability
(MRI)-inactive (""dead zone"") region to an inner MRI-active zone. A pebble ring
builds up until it either becomes gravitationally unstable to form an $\sim 1\
M_\oplus$ planet directly or induces gradual planet formation via core
accretion. The planet may undergo Type I migration into the active region,
allowing a new pebble ring and planet to form behind it. Alternatively if
migration is inefficient, the planet may continue to accrete from the disk
until it becomes massive enough to isolate itself from the accretion flow. A
variety of densities may result depending on the relative importance of
residual gas accretion as the planet approaches its isolation mass. The process
can repeat with a new pebble ring gathering at the new pressure maximum
associated with the retreating dead zone boundary. Our simple analytical model
for this scenario of inside-out planet formation yields planetary masses,
relative mass scalings with orbital radius, and minimum orbital separations
consistent with those seen by Kepler. It provides an explanation of how massive
planets can form with tightly-packed and well-aligned system architectures,
starting from typical protoplanetary disk properties.

paradigm, has found great use in a wide range of communication applications,
including turbo decoding and turbo equalization. The classic approach of
analyzing the iterative approach inevitably use the statistical and
information-theoretical tools that bear ensemble-average flavors. This paper
consider the per-block error rate performance, and analyzes it using nonlinear
dynamical theory. By modeling the iterative processor as a nonlinear dynamical
system, we report a universal ""Z-crease phenomenon:"" the zig-zag or up-and-down
fluctuation -- rather than the monotonic decrease -- of the per-block errors,
as the number of iteration increases. Using the turbo decoder as an example, we
also report several interesting motion phenomenons which were not previously
reported, and which appear to correspond well with the notion of ""pseudo
codewords"" and ""stopping/trapping sets."" We further propose a heuristic
stopping criterion to control Z-crease and identify the best iteration. Our
stopping criterion is most useful for controlling the worst-case per-block
errors, and helps to significantly reduce the average-iteration numbers.

  and complementarity problems",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Variational inequality problems allow for capturing an expansive class of
problems, including convex optimization problems, convex Nash games and
economic equilibrium problems, amongst others. Yet in most practical settings,
such problems are complicated by uncertainty, motivating the examination of a
stochastic generalization of the variational inequality problem and its
extensions in which the components of the mapping contain expectations. When
the associated sets are unbounded, ascertaining existence requires having
access to analytical forms of the expectations. Naturally, in practical
settings, such expressions are often difficult to derive, severely limiting the
applicability of such an approach. Consequently, our goal lies in developing
techniques that obviate the need for integration and our emphasis lies in
developing tractable and verifiable sufficiency conditions for claiming
existence. We begin by recapping almost-sure sufficiency conditions for
stochastic variational inequality problems with single-valued maps provided in
our prior work [44] and provide extensions to multi-valued mappings. Next, we
extend these statements to quasi-variational regimes where maps can be either
single or set-valued. Finally, we refine the obtained results to accommodate
stochastic complementarity problems where the maps are either general or
co-coercive. The applicability of our results is demonstrated on practically
occurring instances of stochastic quasi-variational inequality problems and
stochastic complementarity problems, arising as nonsmooth generalized
Nash-Cournot games and power markets, respectively.

not for analog codes, and hence nonlinear mappings must be employed to fully
harness the power of analog codes. This paper demonstrates new ways of building
effective (nonlinear) analog codes from a special class of nonlinear,
fast-diverging functions known as the chaotic functions. It is shown that the
""butterfly effect"" of the chaotic functions matches elegantly with the distance
expansion condition required for error correction, and that the useful idea in
digital turbo codes can be exploited to construct efficient turbo-like chaotic

exozodis, has been observed around a third of nearby stars. The high levels of
dust required to explain the observations are not generally consistent with
steady-state evolution. A common suggestion is that the dust results from the
aftermath of a dynamical instability, an event akin to the Solar System's Late
Heavy Bombardment. In this work, we use a database of N-body simulations to
investigate the aftermath of dynamical instabilities between giant planets in
systems with outer planetesimal belts. We find that, whilst there is a
significant increase in the mass of material scattered into the inner regions
of the planetary system following an instability, this is a short-lived effect.
Using the maximum lifetime of this material, we determine that even if every
star has a planetary system that goes unstable, there is a very low probability
that we observe more than a maximum of 1% of sun-like stars in the aftermath of
an instability, and that the fraction of planetary systems currently in the
aftermath of an instability is more likely to be limited to <0.06. This
probability increases marginally for younger or higher mass stars. We conclude
that the production of warm dust in the aftermath of dynamical instabilities is
too short-lived to be the dominant source of the abundantly observed
exozodiacal dust.

us to target arbitrary single-qubit gates on desired sites, with minimal
crosstalk to neighboring sites and greatly improved robustness against
uncertainty in the lattice position. We further demonstrate the simultaneous
implementation of different gates at adjacent sites with a single global
control waveform. Coherence is verified through two-pulse Ramsey interrogation,
and randomized benchmarking is used to measure an average gate fidelity of
~95%. Our control-based approach to reduce crosstalk and increase robustness is
broadly applicable in optical lattices irrespective of geometry, and may be
useful also on other platforms for quantum information processing, such as ion
traps and nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond.

Following a classic approach in clustering by \cite{har2004coresets}, we reduce
the problem of finding a clustering with low cost to the problem of finding a
coreset of small size. We provide a distributed method for constructing a
global coreset which improves over the previous methods by reducing the

produced by different progenitors and the channels of stellar evolution leading
to these progenitors. These links have to be very well known to use the
observed frequency of different types of SN events for probing the star
formation rate and massive star evolution in different types of galaxies.
<Aims> We investigate the link between LBV as SN progenitors and the appearance
of episodic radio light curve modulations of the SN event. <Methods> We use the
20Msun and 25Msun models with rotation at solar metallicity, part of an
extended grid of stellar models computed by the Geneva team. At their pre-SN
stage, these two models have recently been shown to have spectra similar to
those of LBV stars and possibly explode as Type IIb SNe. Based on the wind
properties before the explosion, we derive the density structure of their
circumstellar medium. This structure is used as input for computing the SN
radio light curve. <Results> We find that the 20Msun model shows radio light
curves with episodic luminosity modulations, similar to those observed in some
Type IIb SNe. This occurs because the evolution of the 20Msun model terminates
in a region of the HR diagram where radiative stellar winds present strong
density variations, caused by the bistability limit. The 25Msun model, ending
its evolution in a zone of the HR diagram where no change of the mass-loss
rates is expected, presents no such modulations in its radio SN light curve.
<Conclusions> Our results reinforce the link between SN progenitors and LBV
stars. We also confirm the existence of a physical mechanism for a single star
to have episodic radio light curve modulations. In the case of the 25Msun
progenitors, we do not obtain modulations in the radio light curve, but our
models may miss some outbursting behavior in the late stages of massive stars.

allowable planet radii for hot-start models given the host star's age and
likely reflects challenges with constructing accurate atmospheric models.
Alternatively, these radii are comfortably consistent with hot-start model
predictions if $\beta$ Pic b is younger than $\approx$ 7 Myr, consistent with a
late formation, well after its host star's birth $\sim$ 12$^{+8}_{-4}$ Myr ago.

which characterizes its uncertainty around the bound. As applications of the
above asymptotic results, we derive (1) an asymptotic sharp universal uniform
bound on the maximal spurious correlation, as well as its uniform convergence
in distribution when the explanatory variables are independently Gaussian
distributed; and (2) an asymptotic sharp universal bound on the maximum norm of
a low-rank elliptically distributed vector, as well as related limiting
distributions. With these results, we develop a fast detection method for a
low-rank structure in high-dimensional Gaussian data without using the spectrum
information.

we assume that the ratings matrix is generated by applying feature vectors to a
low-rank matrix and the goal is to recover back the underlying matrix.
Furthermore, we generalize the problem to that of low-rank matrix estimation
using rank-1 measurements. We study this generic problem and provide conditions
that the set of measurements should satisfy so that the alternating
minimization method (which otherwise is a non-convex method with no convergence
guarantees) is able to recover back the {\em exact} underlying low-rank matrix.
  In addition to inductive matrix completion, we show that two other low-rank

sensing using rank-1 measurements, and b) multi-label regression with missing
labels. For both the problems, we provide novel and interesting bounds on the
number of measurements required by alternating minimization to provably
converges to the {\em exact} low-rank matrix. In particular, our analysis for
the general low rank matrix sensing problem significantly improves the required
storage and computational cost than that required by the RIP-based matrix
sensing methods \cite{RechtFP2007}. Finally, we provide empirical validation of
our approach and demonstrate that alternating minimization is able to recover

certificate complexity ($C^*(f)$) are three fundamental combinatorial measures
of complexity of a boolean function $f$. It has long been known that $bs(f)
\leq C^{\ast}(f) \leq C(f) =O(bs(f)^2)$. We provide an infinite family of
examples for which $C(f)$ grows quadratically in $C^{\ast}(f)$ (and also
$bs(f)$) giving optimal separations between these measures. Previously the
biggest separation known was $C(f)=C^{\ast}(f)^{\log_{4.5}5}$. We also give a
family of examples for which $C^{\ast}(f)=\Omega(bs(f)^{3/2})$.
  These examples are obtained by composing boolean functions in various ways.
Here the composition $f \circ g$ of $f$ with $g$ is obtained by substituting
for each variable of $f$ a copy of $g$ on disjoint sets of variables. To
construct and analyse these examples we systematically investigate the
behaviour under function composition of these measures and also the sensitivity
measure $s(f)$. The measures $s(f)$, $C(f)$ and $C^{\ast}(f)$ behave nicely
under composition: they are submultiplicative (where measure $m$ is
submultiplicative if $m(f \circ g) \leq m(f)m(g)$) with equality holding under
some fairly general conditions. The measure $bs(f)$ is qualitatively different:
it is not submultiplicative. This qualitative difference was not noticed in the
previous literature and we correct some errors that appeared in previous
papers. We define the composition limit of a measure $m$ at function $f$,
$m^{\lim}(f)$ to be the limit as $k$ grows of $m(f^{(k)})^{1/k}$, where
$f^{(k)}$ is the iterated composition of $f$ with itself $k$-times. For any
function $f$ we show that $bs^{\lim}(f) = (C^*)^{\lim}(f)$ and characterize
$s^{\lim}(f), (C^*)^{\lim}(f)$, and $C^{\lim}(f)$ in terms of the largest
eigenvalue of a certain set of $2\times 2$ matrices associated with $f$.

fingerprint region of 400-500 cm-1. The IR spectra of Fc were measured in
solutions with a number of non-polar solvents such as acetonitrile,
dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane. The measurements agree well with
the earlier IR spectra of Lippincott and Nelson (1958) as well as the most
recent IR spectral measurement in dichloromethane solution of Duhovic and
Diaconescu (2013). All experimental measurements in the solutions unambiguously
exhibit an IR spectral splitting of ca. 15 cm-1 in the 480-500 cm-1 region. The
DFT based B3LYP/m6-31G(d) quantum mechanical calculations using implicit
solvent models in this study indicates that only the ground electronic state of
the eclipsed (D5h) Fc splits in the IR fingerprint region of ca. 500 cm-1. The
IR spectral splitting characterises the centre Fe metal related vibrations of
the eclipsed Fc, in agreement with our previous finding in gas phase [Mohammadi
et al, 2012]. The present study further suggests that the effects of solvents
on the IR spectra of Fc in this region are small and the solvent model effects
are also small but the solute molecular density (SMD) model seems to produce
the most accurate IR spectrum in the region of 400-600 cm-1 of Fc without
scaling the calculated results.

massive spiral galaxies is a basic prediction of galaxy formation models.
However, observational evidence for such coronae is very scarce, with the first
few examples having only been detected recently. In this paper, we study the
large-scale diffuse X-ray emission associated with the massive spiral galaxy
NGC266. Using ROSAT and Chandra X-ray observations we argue that the diffuse
emission extends to at least ~70 kpc, whereas the bulk of the stellar light is
confined to within ~25 kpc. Based on X-ray hardness ratios, we find that most
of the diffuse emission is released at energies <1.2 keV, which indicates that
this emission originates from hot X-ray gas. Adopting a realistic gas
temperature and metallicity, we derive that in the (0.05-0.15)r_200 region
(where r_200 is the virial radius) the bolometric X-ray luminosity of the hot
gas is (4.3 +/- 0.8) x 10^40 erg/s and the gas mass is (9.1 +/- 0.9) x 10^9
M_sun. These values are comparable to those observed for the two other
well-studied X-ray coronae in spiral galaxies, suggesting that the physical
properties of such coronae are similar. This detection offers an excellent
opportunity for comparison of observations with detailed galaxy formation
simulations.

solve all dynamical, radiative transfer, thermal, and ionization processes
self-consistently on the same mesh, as opposed to a postprocessing approach

subgrid model for star formation which we calibrate to observations. Radiation
transport is done in the grey flux-limited diffusion (FLD) approximation, which
is solved by implicit time integration split off from the gas energy and
ionization equations, which are solved separately. This results in a faster and
more robust scheme for cosmological applications compared to the earlier
method. The FLD equation is solved using the hypre optimally scalable geometric
multigrid solver from LLNL. By treating the ionizing radiation as a grid field
as opposed to rays, our method is scalable with respect to the number of
ionizing sources, limited only by the parallel scaling properties of the
radiation solver. We test the speed and accuracy of our approach on a number of
standard verification and validation tests. We show by direct comparison with
Enzo's adaptive ray tracing method Moray that the well-known inability of FLD
to cast a shadow behind opaque clouds has a minor effect on the evolution of
ionized volume and mass fractions in a reionization simulation validation test.

faint end relative to the SMF of local galaxies. As satellites are typically
old galaxies which have been accreted earlier, this feature can cast important
constraint on the formation of low-mass galaxies at high-redshift. The
evolution of the SMFs suggests the star formation in high mass halos
($>10^{12}M_{\odot}h^{-1}$) has to be boosted at high redshift beyond what is
expected from a simple scaling of the dynamical time. The faint end of the CGLF
implies a characteristic redshift $z_c\approx2$ above which the star formation
rate in low mass halos with masses $< 10^{11}M_{\odot}h^{-1}$ must be enhanced
relative to that at lower z. This is not directly expected from the standard
stellar feedback models. Also, this enhancement leads to some interesting
predictions, for instance, a significant old stellar population in present-day
dwarf galaxies with $M_* < 10^8 M_{\odot}h^{-2}$ and steep slopes of high
redshift stellar mass and star formation rate functions.

spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) at the metal/superconductor interface, the tunneling
direction, and the interface quality which includes a near zero tunnel barrier
height. When these junction conditions are collectively satisfied, definitive
signatures of Majorana fermions will emerge. After inspecting a vast amount of

MBS formed at the junction interface. Encouraged by these findings, we have
designed a MBS-supporting d-wave superconductor based pi-loop heterostructure
as a qubit platform. Such pi-loops are characterized by a doubly degenerate
half flux quantum vortex (HQV) and are topologically protected by a parity
effect arising from an odd number of sign changes of the supercurrent
circulating in the loop. The topological protection is further enhanced by the
formation of RSOC induced Majorana bound states at the Josephson junction
interface. The proposed MBS-plus-HQV qubit platform will be useful for
demonstrating non-Abelian exchange statistics and for building a prototype

Method (NSUM) is a tool for producing population size estimates using these
indirect measures of respondents' networks. Killworth et al. [Soc. Netw. 20

likelihood estimators of population size for a fixed effects model in which
respondents' degrees or personal network sizes are treated as fixed. We extend
this by treating personal network sizes as random effects, yielding principled
statements of uncertainty. This allows us to generalize the model to account
for variation in people's propensity to know people in particular subgroups
(barrier effects), such as their tendency to know people like themselves, as
well as their lack of awareness of or reluctance to acknowledge their contacts'
group memberships (transmission bias). NSUM estimates also suffer from recall
bias, in which respondents tend to underestimate the number of members of
larger groups that they know, and conversely for smaller groups. We propose a
data-driven adjustment method to deal with this. Our methods perform well in
simulation studies, generating improved estimates and calibrated uncertainty
intervals, as well as in back estimates of real sample data. We apply them to
data from a study of HIV/AIDS prevalence in Curitiba, Brazil. Our results show
that when transmission bias is present, external information about its likely

Using historical and archival documents, and discussions with people involved
in Dalgaranga research, the reasons for this time gap are explained by a series
of minor misidentifications and coincidences. The age of the crater has yet to
be determined, but using published data, we estimate the projectile mass to be

diagnostic information about the atmosphere is contained in the synthetic line
profiles. We find that the Doppler shift of the central line depression
correlates strongly with the vertical velocity at optical depth unity, which is
typically located less than 200 km below the transition region (TR). By
combining the Doppler shifts of the h and the k line we can retrieve the sign
of the velocity gradient just below the TR. The intensity in the central line
depression is anticorrelated with the formation height, especially in subfields
of a few square Mm. This intensity could thus be used to measure the spatial
variation of the height of the transition region. The intensity in the
line-core emission peaks correlates with the temperature at its formation
height, especially for strong emission peaks. The peaks can thus be exploited
as a temperature diagnostic. The wavelength difference between the blue and red
peaks provides a diagnostic of the velocity gradients in the upper
chromosphere. The intensity ratio of the blue and red peaks correlates strongly
with the average velocity in the upper chromosphere. We conclude that the Mg II
h&k lines are excellent probes of the very upper chromosphere just below the

its effects on the host galaxy may be not only negative but also positive. In
the late gas poor phase, AGN feedback blows the gas away and terminates star
formation. However, in the gas-rich phase(s), AGN outflows trigger star
formation by over-compressing cold dense gas and thus provide positive feedback
on their hosts. In this paper we study this AGN-triggered starburst effect. We
show that star formation rate in the burst increases until the star formation
feedback counteracts locally the AGN outflow compression. Globally, this
predicts a strong nearly linear statistical correlation between the AGN and
starburst bolometric luminosities in disc galaxies, L_* \propto L_{AGN}^{5/6}.
The correlation is statistical only because AGN activity may fluctuate on short
time scales (as short as tens of years), and because AGN may turn off but its
effects on the host may continue to last until the AGN-driven outflow leaves
the host, which may be up to 10 times longer than the duration of the AGN
activity. The coefficient in front of this relation depends on the clumpiness
and morphology of the cold gas in the galaxy. A ""maximum starburst"" takes place
in am azimuthally uniform gas disc, for which we derive an upper limit of L_*
\sim 50 times larger than L_{AGN} for typical quasars. For more clumpy and/or
compact cold gas distributions, the starburst luminosity decreases. We also
suggest that similar AGN-triggerred starbursts are possible in hosts of all
geometries, including during galaxy mergers, provided the AGN is activated.
Finally, we note that due to the short duration of the AGN activity phase the
accelerating influence of AGN on starbursts may be much more common than
observations of simultaneous AGN and starbursts would suggest.

about 220 and 440 days (Lee et al. 2006). However, alternative fits that are
qualitatively different have also been suggested, with two planets in a 1:1

with masses of about 4.78 MJ and 4.80 MJ (where MJ is the mass of Jupiter) and
orbital periods of about 219 and 442 days for the inner and outer planet,

astrophysical properties of radio-loud quasars making up the International
Celestial Reference Frame. Understanding this relationship is important for
improving quasar selection and analysis strategies, and therefore reference
frame stability. We construct light curves for 95 of the most frequently
observed ICRF2 quasars at both the 2.3 and 8.4 GHz geodetic VLBI observing
bands. Because the appearance of new quasar components corresponds to an
increase in quasar flux density, these light curves alert us to potential
changes in source structure before they appear in VLBI images. We test how
source position stability depends on three astrophysical parameters: (1) Flux
density variability at X-band; (2) Time lag between flares in S and X-bands;
(3) Spectral index rms, defined as the variability in the ratio between S and
X-band flux densities. We find that small time lags between S and X-band light
curves, and low spectral index variability, are good indicators of position
stability. On the other hand, there is no strong dependence of source position
stability on flux density variability in a single frequency band. These
findings can be understood by interpreting the time lag between S and X-band
light curves as a measure of the size of the source structure. Monitoring of
source flux density at multiple frequencies therefore appears to provide a
useful probe of quasar structure on scales important to geodesy. We show how
multi-frequency flux density monitoring may allow the dependence on frequency
of the relative core positions along the jet to be elucidated. Knowledge of the
position-frequency relation has important implications for current and future
geodetic VLBI programs, as well as the alignment between the radio and optical
celestial reference frames. (Abridged)

space-time coordinates and gauge theoretical phases. The dilatonic mode acts as
the massive Higgs boson, whose vacuum expectation value determines the gauge
couplings. This mechanism requires that the quadratic divergences, or tadpoles
of the three gauge-theory couplings, unify at a certain scale. We verify this
statement, and find that this occurs at \Lambda_u ~ 4x10^7 GeV. The tadpole
cancellation condition, together with the dilaton self-energy, fixes the value
of the unified tadpole coefficient to be 1/[4 ln(\Lambda_cut/\Lambda_u)]. The
observed values of the coupling constants at \Lambda_u then implies \Lambda_cut
~ 4x10^18 GeV, which is close to the value of the reduced Planck mass
MR_Pl=M_Pl/sqrt(8 pi)=2.4 x 10^18 GeV. In other words, by assuming a cutoff at
M_Pl or MR_Pl, we are able to obtain predictions for the gauge couplings which
agree with the true values to within a few percent. It turns out that this
symmetry breaking can only take place if mass is generated with the aid of some
other means such as electroweak symmetry breaking. Assuming dynamical symmetry
breaking originating at MR_Pl, we obtain M_chi ~ 10^9 GeV, which is not
unreasonable but somewhat higher than \Lambda_u. The cancellation of an anomaly
in the dilaton self-energy requires that the number of fermionic generations
equals three.

formulated as a non-convex optimization problem which takes into account
artificial noise generation to combat potential eavesdroppers, a minimum
required signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the desired
receiver, maximum tolerable SINRs at the potential eavesdroppers, and a minimum
required power delivered to the receivers. We adopt a semidefinite programming

The detailed analysis based on two different simulation methods for doping
clearly shows that the electronic and structural properties change in a

two Ni-$e_g$ orbitals) is reduced and the Ni to apical oxygen distance enlarged

relativistic virial theorem naturally arises as the condition of stability
against dilatations. A bound state becomes scale invariant in the
ultrarelativistic limit, in which its energy vanishes. However, for very
relativistic bound states, scale invariance is broken by quantum effects and
the virial theorem must include the energy-momentum tensor trace anomaly. This
quantum field theory virial theorem is directly related to the Callan-Symanzik

matter interacts with gravity in the minimal form and gravity effects on

the tunneling constant (barrier width $\times$ inverse decay-length of the
wave-function) is $\sim$ 2, indicating the existence of an intrinsic insulating
boundary layer with a well defined electronic (and magnetic) structure. 2. The
tunneling constant for \emph{all} cold-pressed samples decreases linearly with
increasing magnetic-moment/formula-unit.

strongly on the arithmetic properties of the frequencies. Inthe quadratic case,
we use the continued fractions theory to establish a certain arithmetic

integer $k>0$. A generalization of this concept to finite sets of matrices is
as follows: a set of matrices $\mathcal M = \{A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_m \}$ is
primitive if $A_{i_1} A_{i_2} \ldots A_{i_k}$ is positive for some indices
$i_1, i_2, ..., i_k$. The concept of primitive sets of matrices comes up in a
number of problems within the study of discrete-time switched systems. In this
paper, we analyze the computational complexity of deciding if a given set of
matrices is primitive and we derive bounds on the length of the shortest
positive product.
  We show that while primitivity is algorithmically decidable, unless $P=NP$ it
is not possible to decide primitivity of a matrix set in polynomial time.
Moreover, we show that the length of the shortest positive sequence can be
superpolynomial in the dimension of the matrices. On the other hand, defining
${\mathcal P}$ to be the set of matrices with no zero rows or columns, we give
a simple combinatorial proof of a previously-known characterization of
primitivity for matrices in ${\mathcal P}$ which can be tested in polynomial
time. This latter observation is related to the well-known 1964 conjecture of
Cerny on synchronizing automata; in fact, any bound on the minimal length of a
synchronizing word for synchronizing automata immediately translates into a
bound on the length of the shortest positive product of a primitive set of
matrices in ${\mathcal P}$. In particular, any primitive set of $n \times n$
matrices in ${\mathcal P}$ has a positive product of length $O(n^3)$.

the detection by the Large Area Telescope onboard Fermi of gamma rays with

fit to the spectral energy distribution, which allows us to locate the emission
region even beyond the distance generally assumed for the dusty torus. The
consequent large size (~1 pc) inferred for the emission region cannot account
for the observed daily-scale variability of the gamma-ray flux. We discuss the

both the score and the observed information matrix for state space models.
These methods either suffer from a computational cost that is quadratic in the
number of particles, or produce estimates whose variance increases
quadratically with the amount of data. This paper introduces an alternative
approach for estimating these terms at a computational cost that is linear in
the number of particles. The method is derived using a combination of kernel
density estimation, to avoid the particle degeneracy that causes the
quadratically increasing variance, and Rao-Blackwellisation. Crucially, we show
the method is robust to the choice of bandwidth within the kernel density
estimation, as it has good asymptotic properties regardless of this choice. Our
estimates of the score and observed information matrix can be used within both
online and batch procedures for estimating parameters for state space models.
Empirical results show improved parameter estimates compared to existing
methods at a significantly reduced computational cost. Supplementary materials
including code are available.

direction. While good resolution in time and space is mandatory, the challenge
is imposed by the high beam intensity, requiring radiation-hard detectors which
add very little material to the beam path in order to minimize secondary
interactions.
  To this end, a set of triple-GEM detectors with a hybrid readout structure
consisting of pixels in the beam region and 2-D strips in the periphery was
designed and built. Successful prototype tests proved the performance of this
new detector type, showing both extraordinary high rate capability and
detection efficiency. The amplitude information allowed to achieve spatial
resolutions about a factor of 10 smaller than the pitch and a time resolution
close to the theoretical limit imposed by the layout.

improved with respect to the prototype, was completely installed in the COMPASS

determining planetary parameters through spectroscopic and photometric
observations. The overlap of a transiting planet and a stellar spot, for
instance, can produce anomalies in the transit light curves that may lead to
inaccurate estimation of the transit duration, depth and timing. For instance
such inaccuracies can affect the precise derivation of the planet's radius. In
this paper, we present the results of a quantitative study on the effects of
stellar spots on high precision transit light curves. We show that spot
anomalies can lead to the estimate of a planet radius that is 4% smaller than
the real value. The effects on the transit duration can also be of the order of
4%, longer or shorter. Depending on the size and distribution of spots,
anomalies can also produce transit timing variations with significant
amplitudes. For instance, TTVs with signal amplitudes of 200 seconds can be
produced when the spot is completely dark and as large as the largest Sun spot.
Our study also indicates that the minimum size of a stellar spot with
detectable affects on the high precision transit light curve is around 0.03
time the stellar radius for typical Kepler telescope precision. We also show
that the strategy of including more free parameters (such as transit depth and
duration) in the fitting procedure to measure the transit time of each
individual transit will not produce accurate results in the case of active
stars.

apply to a large class of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. Defining S as the
set where the diffusion vanishes, i.e., where the equation is totally
degenerate, we obtain the convergence when the equation is uniformly parabolic
outside S and, on S, the Hamiltonian is either strictly convex or satisfies an
assumption similar of the one introduced by Barles-Souganidis (2000) for
first-order Hamilton-Jacobi equations. This latter assumption allows to deal

flexible backbone under poor solvent conditions are studied by
molecular-dynamics simulations, using a coarse-grained bead-spring model with
side chains of up to N=40 effective monomers. By variation of the solvent
quality and the grafting density $\sigma$ with which side chains are grafted
onto the flexible backbone, we study for backbone lengths of up to $N_b=100$
the crossover from the brush/coil regime to the dense collapsed state. At lower
temperatures, where collapsed chains with a constant monomer density are
observed, the choice of the above parameters does not play any role and it is
the total number of monomers that defines the dimensions of the chains.
Furthermore, bottle-brush polymers with longer side chains possess higher
spherical symmetry compared to chains with lower side-chain lengths in contrast
to what one may intuitively expect, as the stretching of the side chains is
less important than the increase of their length. At higher temperatures,
always below the Theta ($\Theta$) temperature, coil-like configurations,
similar to a single polymer chain, or brush-like configurations, similar to a
homogeneous cylindrical bottle-brush polymer with a rigid backbone, are
observed, depending on the choice of the particular parameters $N$ and
$\sigma$. In the crossover regime between the collapsed state (globule) and the
coil/brush regime the acylindricity increases, whereas for temperatures outside
of this range, bottle-brush polymers maintain a highly cylindrical symmetry in
all configurational states.

unconscious priming effects. Here I argue that this practice requires implicit
assumptions about subjective measures of awareness incompatible with basic
models of categorization under uncertainty (e.g., modern signal-detection and
threshold theories). Most importantly, it ignores the potential effects of
response bias. Instead of taking ""not-seen"" judgments literally, they would
better be employed in parametric experiments where stimulus visibility is

qualitative and double dissociations between measures of awareness and of

that seemingly different heterogeneous networks based on Poisson point

accurately determine equilibrium shapes of droplets on relatively smooth solid
surfaces. The solution, however of the Young Laplace equation becomes tricky
when a droplet is sitting on a geometrically patterned surface and multiple,
and unknown a priori, three phase contact lines have not been accounted for,
since air pockets are trapped beneath the liquid droplet. In this work, we
propose an augmented Young-Laplace equation, in which a unified formulation for
the liquid/vapor and liquid/solid interfaces is adopted, incorporating
microscale interactions. This way, we bypass the implementation of the Young's
contact angle boundary condition at each three phase contact line. We
demonstrate the method's efficiency by computing equilibrium wetting states of
entire droplets sitting on geometrically structured surfaces, and compare the
results with those of the mesoscopic Lattice Boltzmann simulations. The
application of well-established parameter continuation techniques enables the
tracing of stable and unstable equilibrium solutions if necessary for the
determination of energy barriers separating co-existing stable wettign states.
Since energy barriers determine whether a surface facilitates or inhibits
certain wetting transitions, their computation is important for many technical
applications. Our continuum-level analysis can readily be applied to patterned
surfaces with increased and unstructured geometric complexity, having a
significant computational advantage, as compared to the computationally
demanding mesoscopic simulations that are usually employed for the same task.

simulate the evolution of two such S0s: NGC 1533 and NGC 3626. The merging of
two halos with mass ratio 2:1, initially just composed of dark matter (DM) and
gas, well match their observed SEDs, their surface brightness profiles and
their overall kinematics. The residual star formation today ""rejuvenating"" the

kinematical features, e.g. gas-stars counter rotation in NGC 3626, depends on
the halos initial impact parameters. Furthermore, our simulations allow to
follow, in a fully consistent way, the transition of these S0s through the

state to strongly nonequilibrium states is described as a procedure of symmetry
restoration caused by external perturbations. Initially, the trapped gas is
cooled down to such low temperatures, when practically all atoms are in
Bose-Einstein condensed state, which implies the broken global gauge symmetry.
Excitations are realized either by imposing external alternating fields,
modulating the trapping potential and shaking the cloud of trapped atoms, or it
can be done by varying atomic interactions by means of Feshbach resonance
techniques. Gradually increasing the amount of energy pumped into the system,
which is realized either by strengthening the modulation amplitude or by
increasing the excitation time, produces a series of nonequilibrium states,
with the growing fraction of atoms for which the gauge symmetry is restored. In
this way, the initial equilibrium system, with the broken gauge symmetry and
all atoms condensed, can be excited to the state, where all atoms are in the
normal state, with completely restored gauge symmetry. In this process, the
system, starting from the regular superfluid state, passes through the states
of vortex superfluid, turbulent superfluid, heterophase granular fluid, to the
state of normal chaotic fluid in turbulent regime. Both theoretical and
experimental studies are presented.

L$ compass cluster to the $(L-1)\times (L-1)$ one with modified interactions.
This step is crucial and enables: (i) exact diagonalization of the $6\times 6$
quantum compass cluster, and (ii) finding the specific heat for clusters up to
L=6, with two characteristic energy scales. We investigate the properties of
the ground state and the first excited states and present extrapolation of the
excitation energy with increasing system size. Our analysis provides physical
insights into the nature of nematic order realized in the quantum compass model
at finite temperature. We suggest that the quantum phase transition at the
isotropic interaction point is second order with some admixture of the
discontinuous transition, as indicated by the entropy, the overlap between two
types of nematic order (on horizontal and vertical bonds) and the existence of
the critical exponent. Extrapolation of the specific heat to the $L\to\infty$
limit suggests the classical nature of the quantum compass model and high
degeneracy of the ground state with nematic order.

coherence. The largest diffraction signals are achieved at the longest
wavelength that supports a given resolution, which should be better than 0.3
nm. We propose a configuration which combines self-seeding and undulator
tapering techniques with the emittance-spoiler method in order to increase the
XFEL output peak power and to shorten the pulse duration up to a level
sufficient for performing bio-imaging of single protein molecules at the
optimal photon energy range, i.e. around 4 keV. Experiments at the LCLS
confirmed the feasibility of these three new techniques. Based on start-to-end
simulations we demonstrate that self-seeding, combined with undulator tapering,
allows one to achieve up to a 100-fold increase in peak-power. A slotted foil
in the last bunch compressor is added for x-ray pulse duration control.
Simulations indicate that one can achieve diffraction to the desired resolution
with 50 mJ (corresponding to 1e14 photons) per 10 fs pulse at 3.5 keV photon
energy in a 100 nm focus. This result is exemplified using the photosystem I

decade. Preferential attachment (PA) is considered a common explanation to the
self organization of evolving networks, suggesting that new nodes prefer to
attach to more popular nodes. The PA model results in broad degree
distributions, found in many networks, but cannot explain other common
properties such as: The growth of nodes arriving late and Clustering (community
structure). Here we show that when the tendency of networks to adhere to trends
is incorporated into the PA model, it can produce networks with such
properties. Namely, in trending networks, newly arriving nodes may become
central at random, forming new clusters. In particular, we show that when the
network is young it is more susceptible to trends, but even older networks may
have trendy new nodes that become central in their structure. Alternatively,
networks can be seen as composed of two parts: static, governed by a power law
degree distribution, and a dynamic part governed by trends, as we show on Wiki
pages. Our results also show that the arrival of trending new nodes not only
creates new clusters, but also has an effect on the relative importance and
centrality of all other nodes in the network. This can explain a variety of
real world networks in economics, social and online networks, and cultural
networks. Products popularity, formed by the network of people's opinions,
exhibit these properties. Some lines of products are increasingly susceptible
to trends and hence to shifts in popularity, while others are less trendy and
hence more stable. We believe that our findings have a big impact on our

evolving in non-singular quantum cosmological backgrounds, and calculate some
of their observational consequences. These results are not known how to be
obtained in other approaches to quantum theory. In the general case of full
superspace, we enumerate the possible structures of quantum space and time that

physical sciences and is a source of degeneracy and disorder, giving rise to
new and interesting physical phenomena. Perhaps nowhere does it occur more
simply than in correlated spin systems, where it has been studied in the most
detail. In the past few years, a new perspective has opened in the study of
frustration through the creation of artificial frustrated magnetic systems.
These materials consist of arrays of lithographically fabricated single-domain
ferromagnetic nanostructures that behave like giant Ising spins. The
nanostructures' interactions can be controlled through appropriate choices of
their geometric properties and arrangement on a (frustrated) lattice. The
degrees of freedom of the material can not only be directly tuned, but also
individually observed. Experimental studies have unearthed intriguing
connections to the out-of-equilibrium physics of disordered systems and
non-thermal granular materials, while revealing strong analogies to (spin) ice
materials and their fractionalized magnetic monopole excitations, lending the
enterprise a distinctly interdisciplinary flavor. The experimental results have
also been closely coupled to theoretical and computational analyses,
facilitated by connections to classic models of frustrated magnetism, whose
hitherto unobserved aspects have here found an experimental realization. We
review the considerable experimental and theoretical progress in this field,
including connections to other frustrated phenomena, and we outline future
vistas for progress in this rapidly expanding field.

what quantum conditional probability should be, and also there are extra

arising due to the fermions decoupling from the high momentum gluons and we
observe that the running of operators with the scale at large lattice momenta

only possible to talk about the existence of elementary particles when they are

distortions with regard to the objective existence of reality, since it would
be necessary an observer to materialize the elementary particle. This issue is
solved when the elementary particle is placed in permanent interaction with the
rest of the universe, so its existence would not depend on any intelligent
observer and thus the objective range of elementary particles would be
recovered. This article explores the interaction between elementary particles
and a background action field of stochastic character and it is also determined
that the standard deviation of the particle-background field interaction is
essentially the Planck constant, since the expressions of the energy according
to the Planck postulate and the momentum according to the Louis de Broglie
thesis follow in a natural way. In addition, the expression for the wave
function of a free particle is obtained from the solution of the integral
equation that relates the momentum and the energy with the wave vector and the
angular frequency of a Gaussian distribution. Also, the Schr\""odinger equation
is deduced from the expression for the wave function of an elementary particle
in a potential field. Finally, the uncertainty principle is obtained. The
theory presented in this article rescues the objective nature of Quantum
Mechanics which implies that elementary particles exist independently of
observers since the classical measurement device in this theory, introduced by
the authors, is the own universe.

surface to form, a quantum critical surface sweeps over the collapsing body,
transforming the nucleons in the collapsing matter into a lepton/photon gas
together with a positive vacuum energy. This will happen regardless of the
matter density at the time a trapped surface starts to form, and as a result we
predict that at least in all cases of gravitational collapse involving ordinary
matter, a large fraction of the rest mass of the collapsing matter will be
converted into a burst of neutrinos, and {\gamma}-rays. We predict that the
peak luminosity of these bursts is only weakly dependent on the mass of the
collapsing object, and is on the order of ({\epsilon}_q/m_Pc^2)^1/4c^5/G, where
{\epsilon}_q is the mean energy of a nucleon parton and m_P is the Planck mass.
The duration of the bursts will depend the mass of the collapsing objects; in

  Minimal Length Scale Based on the Kempf Algebra","18 pages, accepted for publication in Int. J. Mod. Phys. A",,"10.1142/S0217751X1350142X",,"hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the 1990s, Kempf and his collaborators Mangano and Mann introduced a
$D$-dimensional $(\beta,\beta')$-two-parameter deformed Heisenberg algebra
which leads to an isotropic minimal length $(\triangle
X^{i})_{min}=\hbar\sqrt{D\beta+\beta'}\;,\forall i\in \{1,2, \cdots,D\}$. In
this work, the Lagrangian formulation of a magnetostatic field in three spatial
dimensions $(D=3)$ described by Kempf algebra is presented in the special case
of $\beta'=2\beta$ up to the first order over $\beta$. We show that at the
classical level there is a similarity between magnetostatics in the presence of
a minimal length scale (modified magnetostatics) and the magnetostatic sector
of the Abelian Lee-Wick model in three spatial dimensions. The integral form of
Ampere's law and the energy density of a magnetostatic field in the modified
magnetostatics are obtained. Also, the Biot-Savart law in the modified
magnetostatics is found. By studying the effect of minimal length corrections
to the gyromagnetic moment of the muon, we conclude that the upper bound on the
isotropic minimal length scale in three spatial dimensions is
$4.42\times10^{-19}m$. The relationship between magnetostatics with a minimal
length and the Gaete-Spallucci non-local magnetostatics (J. Phys. A: Math.
Theor. \textbf{45}, 065401 (2012)) is investigated.

Caner","Constitutive Model for Material Comminuting at High Shear Rate","13 pages, 2 figures",,,"13-05/732c","cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The modeling of high velocity impact into brittle or quasibrittle solids is
hampered by the unavailability of a constitutive model capturing the effects of
material comminution into very fine particles. The present objective is to
develop such a model, usable in finite element programs. The comminution at
very high strain rates can dissipate a large portion of the kinetic energy of
an impacting missile. The spatial derivative of the energy dissipated by
comminution gives a force resisting the penetration, which is superposed on the
nodal forces obtained from the static constitutive model in a finite element
program. The present theory is inspired partly by Grady's model for comminution
due to explosion inside a hollow sphere, and partly by analogy with turbulence.
In high velocity turbulent flow, the energy dissipation rate is enhanced by the
formation of micro-vortices (eddies) which dissipate energy by viscous shear
stress. Similarly, here it is assumed that the energy dissipation at fast
deformation of a confined solid gets enhanced by the release of kinetic energy
of the motion associated with a high-rate shear strain of forming particles.
For simplicity, the shape of these particles in the plane of maximum shear rate
is considered to be regular hexagons. The rate of release of free energy
density consisting of the sum of this energy and the fracture energy of the
interface between the forming particle is minimized. The particle sizes are
assumed to be distributed according to Schuhmann's power law. It is concluded
that the minimum particle size is inversely proportional to the (2/3)-power of
the shear strain rate, that the kinetic energy release is to proportional to
the (2/3)-power, and that the dynamic comminution creates an apparent material
viscosity inversely proportional to the (1/3)-power of the shear strain rate.

A GPU-accelerated direct boundary integral equation (DBIE) method is
implemented. This is about 1000 times faster than the original DBIE used on
solar NLFFF modeling. Using the SDO/HMI vector magnetogram as the bottom
boundary condition, the reconstructed magnetic field lines are compared with
the projected EUV loop structures from different views three-dimensionally by
SDO/AIA and STEREO A/B spacecraft simultaneously for the first time. They show
very good agreement so that the topological configurations of the magnetic
fields can be analyzed, thus its role in the flare process of the active region
can be better understood. A quantitative comparison with some stereoscopically
reconstructed coronal loops shows that the present averaged misalignment angles
are at the same order as the state-of-the-art results obtained with
reconstructed coronal loops as prescribed conditions and better than other
NLFFF methods. It is found that the observed coronal loop structures can be
grouped into bundles of closed and open loops with some central bright coronal
loops around the polarity inversion line (PIL). The reconstructed
highly-shearing magnetic field lines agree very well with the low-lying
S-shaped filament channel along PIL. They are in a pivot position to all other
surrounding coronal structures, and a group of electric current lines
co-aligned with the central bright EUV loops overlying the filament channel is
also obtained. This central lower-lying magnetic field loop system must have
played a key role in powering the flare. It should be noted that while a
strand-like coronal feature along PIL may be related to the filament, one
cannot simply attribute all the coronal bright features along PIL to
manifestation of the filament without any stereoscopically information. It
shows that DBIE is rigorous and effective.

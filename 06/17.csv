q^{inv(pi)} where q is a real parameter and inv(pi) is the number of inversions
in pi. The case q=1 corresponds to uniformly random permutations. The Mallows
measure was introduced by Mallows in connection with ranking problems in
statistics.
  We determine the typical order of magnitude of the lengths of the longest
increasing and decreasing subsequences, as well as large deviation bounds for
them. We also provide a simple bound on the variance of these lengths, and
prove a law of large numbers for the length of the longest increasing
subsequence. Assuming without loss of generality that q<1, our results apply
when q is a function of n satisfying n(1-q) -> infty. The case that n(1-q)=O(1)
was considered previously by Mueller and Starr. In our parameter range, the
typical length of the longest increasing subsequence is of order n(1-q)^(1/2),
whereas the typical length of the longest decreasing subsequence has four
possible behaviors according to the precise dependence of n and q.
  We show also that in the graphical representation of a Mallows-distributed
permutation, most points are found in a symmetric strip around the diagonal
whose width is of order 1/(1-q). This suggests a connection between the longest
increasing subsequence in the Mallows model and the model of last passage

from near the lunar surface, by India's Chandrayaan-1 mission (CH-1), and from
a much more distant Earth orbit by NASA's Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX)

fraction of the solar wind is reflected from the Moon as energetic neutral
hydrogen. CH-1's angular resolution over different viewing angles of the lunar
surface has enabled measurement of the emission as a function of angle. IBEX in
contrast views not just a swath but a whole quadrant of the Moon as effectively
a single pixel, as it subtends even at the closest approach no more than a few
degrees on the sky. Here we use the scattering function measured by CH-1 to
model global lunar ENA emission and combine these with IBEX observations. The
deduced global reflection is modestly larger (by a factor of 1.25) when the
angular scattering function is included. This provides a slightly updated IBEX

and plasma, the ISM is by no means uniform. The interaction of the local ISM
with the solar wind shapes our heliospheric environment with hydrogen being the
dominant component of the very local ISM. In this paper, we report on direct
sampling of the neutral hydrogen of the local ISM over four years of IBEX
observations. The hydrogen wind observed at 1 AU has decreased and nearly
disappeared as the solar activity has increased over the last four years; the
signal at 1 AU has dropped off in 2012 by a factor of ~8 to near background
levels. The longitudinal offset has also increased with time presumably due to
greater radiation pressure deflecting the interstellar wind. We present
longitudinal and latitudinal arrival direction measurements of the bulk flow as
measured over four years beginning at near solar minimum conditions. The H
distribution we observe at 1 AU is expected to be different from that outside
the heliopause due to ionization, photon pressure, gravity, and filtration by
interactions with heliospheric plasma populations. These observations provide
an important benchmark for modeling of the global heliospheric interaction.

sparse, is a central task in modern high-dimensional statistics. Many
algorithms were developed for this sparse PCA problem, from simple diagonal
thresholding to sophisticated semidefinite programming (SDP) methods. A key
theoretical question is under what conditions can such algorithms recover the
sparse principal components? We study this question for a single-spike model
with an $\ell_0$-sparse eigenvector, in the asymptotic regime as dimension $p$
and sample size $n$ both tend to infinity. Amini and Wainwright [Ann. Statist.
37 (2009) 2877-2921] proved that for sparsity levels $k\geq\Omega(n/\log p)$,
no algorithm, efficient or not, can reliably recover the sparse eigenvector. In
contrast, for $k\leq O(\sqrt{n/\log p})$, diagonal thresholding is consistent.
It was further conjectured that an SDP approach may close this gap between
computational and information limits. We prove that when
$k\geq\Omega(\sqrt{n})$, the proposed SDP approach, at least in its standard
usage, cannot recover the sparse spike. In fact, we conjecture that in the
single-spike model, no computationally-efficient algorithm can recover a spike
of $\ell_0$-sparsity $k\geq\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. Finally, we present empirical

transmitted over strong phase noise channels is presented. The algorithm is
based on the Sum & Product Algorithm (SPA) with phase noise messages modeled as
Tikhonov mixtures. Since mixture based Bayesian inference such as SPA, creates
an exponential increase in mixture order for consecutive messages, mixture
reduction is necessary. We propose a low complexity mixture reduction algorithm
which finds a reduced order mixture whose dissimilarity metric is
mathematically proven to be upper bounded by a given threshold. As part of the
mixture reduction, a new method for optimal clustering provides the closest
circular distribution, in Kullback Leibler sense, to any circular mixture. We
further show a method for limiting the number of tracked components and further
complexity reduction approaches. We show simulation results and complexity
analysis for the proposed algorithm and show better performance than other
state of the art low complexity algorithms. We show that the Tikhonov mixture
approximation of SPA messages is equivalent to the tracking of multiple phase
trajectories, or also can be looked as smart multiple phase locked loops (PLL).
When the number of components is limited to one the result is similar to a
smart PLL.

transport theory and experiments. Initially formulated for classical systems,
these reciprocity relations are also fulfilled in quantum conductors.
Surprisingly, novel relations have been predicted specifically for
thermoelectric transport. However, whereas these thermoelectric reciprocity
relations have to date not been verified, they have been predicted to be
sensitive to inelastic scattering, always present at finite temperature. The
question whether the relations exist in practice is important for
thermoelectricity: whereas their existence may simplify the theory of complex
thermoelectric materials, their absence has been shown to enable, in principle,
higher thermoelectric energy conversion efficiency for a given material
quality. Here we experimentally verify the thermoelectric reciprocity relations
in a four-terminal mesoscopic device where each terminal can be electrically
and thermally biased, individually. The linear response thermoelectric
coefficients are found to be symmetric under simultaneous reversal of magnetic
field and exchange of injection and emission contacts. Intriguingly, we also
observe the breakdown of the reciprocity relations as a function of increasing
thermal bias. Our measurements thus clearly establish the existence of the

Missions such as Kepler and CoRoT provide tens of thousands of rotation
periods, drawn from stellar populations that contain objects at a range of
masses, ages, and evolutionary states. Given a set of reasonable starting
conditions and a prescription for angular momentum loss, we address the
expected range of rotation periods for cool field stellar populations. We find
that cool stars fall into three distinct regimes in rotation. Rapid rotators
with surface periods less than 10 days are either young low-mass main sequence
(MS) stars, or higher mass subgiants which leave the MS with high rotation
rates. Intermediate rotators (10-40 days) can be either cool MS dwarfs,
suitable for gyrochronology, or crossing subgiants at a range of masses.
Gyrochronology relations must therefore be applied cautiously, since there is
an abundant population of subgiant contaminants. The slowest rotators, at
periods greater than 40 days, are lower mass subgiants undergoing envelope
expansion. We identify additional diagnostic uses of rotation periods. There
exists a period-age relation for subgiants distinct from the MS period-age
relations. There is also a period-radius relation that can be used as a
constraint on the stellar radius, particularly in the interesting case of
planet host stars. The high-mass/low-mass break in the rotation distribution on
the MS persists onto the subgiant branch, and has potential as a diagnostic of
stellar mass. Finally, this set of theoretical predictions can be compared to
extensive datasets to motivate improved modeling.

amplify contagion due to overlapping portfolios. To illustrate this point, we
consider the case of the Austrian interbank network and perform stress tests on
it according to different protocols. We consider in particular contagion due to
(i) counterparty loss; (ii) roll-over risk; and (iii) overlapping portfolios.
We find that the average number of bankruptcies caused by counterparty loss and
roll-over risk is fairly small if these contagion mechanisms are considered in
isolation. Once portfolio overlaps are also accounted for, however, we observe
that the network of direct interbank exposures significantly contributes to
systemic risk.

reduce computational costs at the price of inflated variance in estimating

regression by adjusting the class balance locally in feature space via an
accept-reject scheme. Our method generalizes standard case-control sampling,
using a pilot estimate to preferentially select examples whose responses are
conditionally rare given their features. The biased subsampling is corrected by
a post-hoc analytic adjustment to the parameters. The method is simple and
requires one parallelizable scan over the full data set. Standard case-control
sampling is inconsistent under model misspecification for the population
risk-minimizing coefficients $\theta^*$. By contrast, our estimator is
consistent for $\theta^*$ provided that the pilot estimate is. Moreover, under
correct specification and with a consistent, independent pilot estimate, our
estimator has exactly twice the asymptotic variance of the full-sample MLE -
even if the selected subsample comprises a miniscule fraction of the full data
set, as happens when the original data are severely imbalanced. The factor of
two improves to $1+\frac{1}{c}$ if we multiply the baseline acceptance
probabilities by $c>1$ (and weight points with acceptance probability greater

imperfect and delayed channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), the
work here explores the performance of the two user MIMO BC and the two user
MIMO interference channel (MIMO IC), in the presence of feedback with evolving
quality and timeliness. Under standard assumptions, and in the presence of M
antennas per transmitter and N antennas per receiver, the work derives the DoF
region, which is optimal for a large regime of sufficiently good (but
potentially imperfect) delayed CSIT. This region concisely captures the effect
of having predicted, current and delayed-CSIT, as well as concisely captures
the effect of the quality of CSIT offered at any time, about any channel. In
addition to the progress towards describing the limits of using such imperfect
and delayed feedback in MIMO settings, the work offers different insights that
include the fact that, an increasing number of receive antennas can allow for
reduced quality feedback, as well as that no CSIT is needed for the direct
links in the IC.

Symbolic computation, especially, Gr\""obner bases theory, enables us to rewrite
the polynomial equations into more trimmed and tractable forms with identical
roots, from which we can unravel the relationship between physical parameters

one by one in order. Furthermore, this method is a unified way to solve the

ground-state spin configuration by varying dot size or interdot distance in the
absence of external fields. This transition has not been reported in the
literature on triple quantum dots. In the magnetic-field (Faraday

energy splittings between the energy levels with the same spin state in the
absence of the spin-orbit coupling. This anticrossing behavior originates from
the triple quantum dot confinement potential. In addition, with the inclusion
of the spin-orbit coupling, we find that all the intersections shown in the
equilateral triangular case become anticrossing whereas only part of the
intersections in symmetric linear case show anticrossing behavior in the
presence of magnetic field in either the Faraday or Voigt configuration. All
the anticrossing behaviors are analyzed based on symmetry consideration.

surface. In a previous model without current sheets, only one critical point
exists in the flux rope equilibrium curve. New features show up in the
equilibrium curves for the flux rope when current sheets appear in the
magnetosphere. The causal connection between the precursor and the giant flare,
as well as the temporary re-entry of the quiescent state between the precursor
and the giant flare, can be naturally explained. Magnetic energy would be
released during the catastrophic state transitions. The detailed energetics of
the model are also discussed. The current sheet created by the catastrophic
loss of equilibrium of the flux rope provides an ideal place for magnetic
reconnection. We point out the importance of magnetic reconnection for further

scenarios, i.e., electrons at rest, isotropic electrons with a power law
spectrum and thermal electrons. If the incident beam is polarized, the
polarization is reduced significantly by isotropic electrons at large viewing
angles, and the degree of polarization due to thermal electrons is about one
times less than that of electrons in a power law. If the incident bean is
unpolarized, soft $\gamma$-rays can lead to about 15% polarization at viewing
angles around $\pi/4$. For isotropic electrons, one remarkable feature is that
the polarization as a function of the incident photon energy always peaks
roughly at 1 MeV, this is valid for both the thermal and power law cases. This
feature can be used to distinguish the model of the inverse Compton scattering
from that of the synchrotron radiation.

gravitational wave (GW) sources. Next-generation GW detectors are expected to
detect signals from the NS merger within 200 Mpc. Detection of electromagnetic
wave (EM) counterpart is crucial to understand the nature of GW sources. Among
possible EM emission from the NS merger, emission powered by radioactive
r-process nuclei is one of the best targets for follow-up observations.
However, prediction so far does not take into account detailed r-process
element abundances in the ejecta. We perform radiative transfer simulations for
the NS merger ejecta including all the r-process elements from Ga to U for the
first time. We show that the opacity in the NS merger ejecta is about kappa =
10 cm^2 g^{-1}, which is higher than that of Fe-rich Type Ia supernova ejecta
by a factor of ~ 100. As a result, the emission is fainter and longer than
previously expected. The spectra are almost featureless due to the high
expansion velocity and bound-bound transitions of many different r-process
elements. We demonstrate that the emission is brighter for a higher mass ratio
of two NSs and a softer equation of states adopted in the merger simulations.
Because of the red color of the emission, follow-up observations in red optical
and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths will be the most efficient. At 200 Mpc,
expected brightness of the emission is i = 22 - 25 AB mag, z = 21 - 23 AB mag,
and 21 - 24 AB mag in NIR JHK bands. Thus, observations with wide-field 4m- and
8m-class optical telescopes and wide-field NIR space telescopes are necessary.
We also argue that the emission powered by radioactive energy can be detected
in the afterglow of nearby short gamma-ray bursts.

An important question is whether such supernovae can be detected in the limited

high redshifts, using the observationally-calibrated star formation rate
density and supernova occurrence rate. We show that a 100 deg^2 survey with the
limiting magnitude of 26 mag in near-infrared wavelengths will be able to
discover about 10 SLSNe at z > 10. If the survey is extended to 200 deg^2 with
27 mag depth, about 10 SLSNe can be discovered at z > 15. We emphasize that the
observations at > 3 um are crucial to detect and select SLSNe at z > 10. Our
simulations are also applied to the planned survey with Euclid, WFIRST, and
WISH. These surveys will be able to detect about 1000, 400, and 3000 SLSNe up

curves exhibit strong deviations from standard models. From modeling
considering various second-order effects, we find that the deviations are
mostly explained by the effect of the lens orbital motion. We also find that
lens parallax effects can mimic orbital effects to some extent. This implies
that modeling light curves of binary-lens events not considering orbital

actual values and thus wrong determinations of physical lens parameters. This
demonstrates the importance of routine consideration of orbital effects in

from the notion of maximal solutions of the Cauchy problem associated to the

followed by a period of relative mean stability from 1999 to 2012. We
investigated changes in the atmospheric extinction of the SDEs as an indicator
of strength of the episodes and found that this parameter approximately follows
the SDE frequency, however, instrumental limitations prevented us from deriving
precise conclusions regarding their long-term changes. A lagged correlation
analysis between SDE properties and the El Ni\~{n}o Southern Oscillation

computing boolean functions - branching programs, circuits, decision trees and
ordered binary decision diagrams to name a few. A natural question that arises
in this context with respect to any such model is this:
  Given a function f:{0,1}^n \to {0,1}, can we compute the optimal complexity
of computing f in the computational model in question? (according to some
desirable measure).
  A critical issue regarding this question is how exactly is f given, since a
more elaborate description of f allows the algorithm to use more computational
resources. Among the possible representations are black-box access to f (such
as in computational learning theory), a representation of f in the desired
computational model or a representation of f in some other model. One might
conjecture that if f is given as its complete truth table (i.e., a list of f's
values on each of its 2^n possible inputs), the most elaborate description
conceivable, then any computational model can be efficiently computed, since
the algorithm computing it can run poly(2^n) time. Several recent studies show
that this is far from the truth - some models have efficient and simple
algorithms that yield the desired result, others are believed to be hard, and
for some models this problem remains open.
  In this thesis we will discuss the computational complexity of this question
regarding several common types of computational models. We shall present
several new hardness results and efficient algorithms, as well as new proofs
and extensions for known theorems, for variants of decision trees, formulas and
branching programs.

solutions showed a great practical and theoretical efficiency of a particular
technique called $\ell_1$-optimization. Seminal works \cite{CRT,DOnoho06CS}
rigorously confirmed it for the first time. Namely, \cite{CRT,DOnoho06CS}
showed, in a statistical context, that $\ell_1$ technique can recover sparse
solutions of under-determined systems even when the sparsity is linearly
proportional to the dimension of the system. A followup \cite{DonohoPol} then
precisely characterized such a linearity through a geometric approach and a
series of work\cite{StojnicCSetam09,StojnicUpper10,StojnicEquiv10} reaffirmed
statements of \cite{DonohoPol} through a purely probabilistic approach. A
theoretically interesting alternative to $\ell_1$ is a more general version
called $\ell_q$ (with an essentially arbitrary $q$). While $\ell_1$ is
typically considered as a first available convex relaxation of sparsity norm
$\ell_0$, $\ell_q,0\leq q\leq 1$, albeit non-convex, should technically be a
tighter relaxation of $\ell_0$. Even though developing polynomial (or close to
be polynomial) algorithms for non-convex problems is still in its initial
phases one may wonder what would be the limits of an $\ell_q,0\leq q\leq 1$,
relaxation even if at some point one can develop algorithms that could handle
its non-convexity. A collection of answers to this and a few realted questions
is precisely what we present in this paper.

New Physics beyond the Standard Model by means of quark flavour violating

the scales as short as 10^{-20} m and even shorter distance scales
corresponding to energies of 100 TeV. Rather then using all possible flavour
violating observables that will be measured in the coming years, we concentrate
on those observables that are theoretically clean and very sensitive to NP.
Assuming that the data on the selected observables by us will be very precise,
we stress the importance of correlations between these observables as well as
of future precise calculations of non-perturbative parameters by means of
lattice QCD. Our strategy consists of twelve steps which we will discuss in
detail illustrating possible outcomes with the help of the SM, models with
CMFV, MFV and models with tree-level FCNCs mediated by neutral gauge bosons and
scalars. We propose DNA-charts that exhibit correlations between flavour
observables in different NP scenarios. The models with new left-handed and/or
right-handed currents and non-MFV interactions can be distinguished
transparently in this manner. We emphasis the important role of the stringent
CMFV relations between various observables as standard candles of flavour
physics. The pattern of deviations from these relations may help in identifying
the correct NP scenario. The success of this program will be very much
facilitated through direct signals of NP at the LHC. We also emphasize the
importance of lepton flavour violation, electric dipole moments and
(g-2)_{e,mu} in these studies.

linear systems of equations with sparse solutions. $\ell_1$-minimization is a
fairly successful polynomial technique that can in certain statistical
scenarios find sparse enough solutions of such systems. Barriers of $\ell_1$
performance are typically referred to as its thresholds. Depending if one is
interested in a typical or worst case behavior one then distinguishes between
the \emph{weak} thresholds that relate to a typical behavior on one side and
the \emph{sectional} and \emph{strong} thresholds that relate to the worst case
behavior on the other side. Starting with seminal works
\cite{CRT,DonohoPol,DOnoho06CS} a substantial progress has been achieved in
theoretical characterization of $\ell_1$-minimization statistical thresholds.
More precisely, \cite{CRT,DOnoho06CS} presented for the first time linear lower
bounds on all of these thresholds. Donoho's work \cite{DonohoPol} (and our own
\cite{StojnicCSetam09,StojnicUpper10}) went a bit further and essentially
settled the $\ell_1$'s \emph{weak} thresholds. At the same time they also
provided fairly good lower bounds on the values on the \emph{sectional} and
\emph{strong} thresholds. In this paper, we revisit the \emph{sectional}
thresholds and present a simple mechanism that can be used to create solid
upper bounds as well. The method we present relies on a seemingly simple but
substantial progress we made in studying Hopfield models in
\cite{StojnicHopBnds10}.

During the
last decade these properties gained a lot attention in a field called
compressed sensing in first place due to their initial use in \cite{CRT,CT}.
Namely, in \cite{CRT,CT} these quantities were used as a critical tool in
providing a rigorous analysis of $\ell_1$ optimization's ability to solve an
under-determined system of linear equations with sparse solutions. In such a
framework a particular type of isometry, called restricted isometry, plays a
key role. One then typically introduces a couple of quantities, called upper
and lower restricted isometry constants to characterize the isometry properties
of random matrices. Those constants are then usually viewed as mathematical
objects of interest and their a precise characterization is desirable. The
first estimates of these quantities within compressed sensing were given in
\cite{CRT,CT}. As the need for precisely estimating them grew further a finer
improvements of these initial estimates were obtained in e.g.
\cite{BCTsharp09,BT10}. These are typically obtained through a combination of
union-bounding strategy and powerful tail estimates of extreme eigenvalues of
Wishart (Gaussian) matrices (see, e.g. \cite{Edelman88}). In this paper we
attempt to circumvent such an approach and provide an alternative way to obtain
similar estimates.

systems for several reasons, among them the possibility of the existence of
infinite hidden symmetries, such as conformal symmetry or the symmetry
associated with area preserving diffeo-morphisms. It is known that when the
symmetry algebra is large enough, symmetry may fully prescribe the dynamics.
However, the way this is borne out in two dimensional hydrodynamics, both
classical and quantum, is not fully understood. Here we take a step in
clarifying this issue, by focusing on a particular example, namely that of a
two dimensional phase space liquid which emerges when one considers the
Calogero model, a many-body one-dimensional system interacting through an
inverse square law potential. We demonstrate how the symmetry algebra of
conserved quantities of the one dimensional system is expressed in terms of the
incompressible Euler hydrodynamics of point vortices in phase space. Due to a
formal relation between quantum hydrodynamics and classical stochastic
hydrodynamics, which is inherent in the method of stochastic quantization, the
ideas and methods developed here may also have application in the study of
stochastic classical hydrodynamics, after suitable modifications.

of ordering of knowledge and at the same time allows expression of different
perspectives on various products of human knowledge production. In this paper
we look at UDC strings derived from the holdings of libraries. In particular we
analyse the subject headings of holdings of the university library in Leuven,
and an extraction of UDC numbers from the OCLC WorldCat. Comparing those sets

occurrence of different auxiliary signs, and the resulting connections between

Mapping out basic statistics on UDC classes as used in libraries from a point
of view of complexity theory bears different benefits. Deploying its structure
could serve as an overview and basic information for users among the nature and

the complex nature of the UDC as an example for a knowledge ordering system,
which deserves future exploration from a complexity theoretical perspective.

cooperating base stations transmit identical signals over paths with

combining. The analysis in this paper is driven by a new expression for the
conditional outage probability when signals arriving over different paths are
combined in the presence of noise and interference, where the conditioning is
with respect to the network topology and shadowing. The channel model accounts
for path loss, shadowing, and Nakagami fading, and the Nakagami fading
parameters do not need to be identical for all paths. To study performance over
a wide class of network topologies, a random spatial model is adopted, and
performance is found by statistically characterizing the rates provided on the

the paper proceeds to determine performance under several resource-allocation

canonical quantization procedure for the bi-spinor gauge theory in terms of its

stable symmetric monoidal $(\infty,1)$-category $SH_{nc}$ encoding a motivic
stable homotopy theory for the noncommutative spaces of Kontsevich and obtained
a canonical monoidal colimit-preserving functor $SH\to SH_{nc}$ relating this
new theory to the $(\infty,1)$-category encoding the stable motivic
$\mathbb{A}^1$ theory of Morel-Voevodsky. For a scheme $X$ this map recovers
the dg-derived category of perfect complexes $L_{pe}(X)$.
  In this sequel we address the study of the different flavours of algebraic
$K$-theory of dg-categories. As in the commutative case, these can be
understood as spectral valued $\infty$-presheaves over the category of
noncommutative smooth spaces and therefore provide objects in $SH_{nc}$ once
properly localized. Our first main result is the description of non-connective
$K$-theory of dg-categories introduced by Schlichting as the noncommutative
Nisnevich sheafification of connective $K$-theory. In particular it follows
that its further $\mathbb{A}^1$-localization is an object in $SH_{nc}$. As a
corollary of the recent result in A. Blanc Phd thesis, we prove that this
object is a unit for the monoidal structure.
  Using this, we obtain a precise proof for a conjecture of Kontsevich claiming
that $K$-theory gives the correct mapping spaces in noncommutative motives. As
a second corollary we obtain a factorization of our comparison map $SH\to
SH_{nc}$ through $Mod_{KH}(SH)$ - the $(\infty,1)$-category of modules over the
commutative algebra object $KH$ representing homotopy invariant algebraic
$K$-theory of schemes in $SH$. If $k$ is a field admitting resolutions of
singularities, this factorization is fully faithful, so that, at the motivic
level, no information (below $K$-theory) is lost by passing to the
noncommutative world.

  The following paper presents a new method for sensitivity analysis of {\em

involves solving the governing equations for the system's invariant measure and
its adjoint on the system's attractor manifold rather than in phase-space. This

Moreover, \cite{CRT,DOnoho06CS} established for the first time in a statistical

existing solution of an under-determined linear system through $\ell_1$
optimization. In \cite{DonohoPol,DonohoUnsigned} (and later in

couple of algorithms that turn out to be capable of recovering a substantially
higher sparsity than the $\ell_1$. However, these algorithms assume a bit of

the original problem of improving upon $\ell_1$ to designing algorithms that

an analytical study of perceptrons storage abilities. Many of the Gardner's
predictions obtained through statistical mechanics tools have been rigorously
justified. Among the most important ones are of course the storage capacities.
The first rigorous confirmations were obtained in \cite{SchTir02,SchTir03} for
the storage capacity of the so-called positive spherical perceptron. These were
later reestablished in \cite{TalBook} and a bit more recently in
\cite{StojnicGardGen13}. In this paper we consider a variant of the spherical
perceptron that operates as a storage memory but allows for a certain fraction
of errors. In Gardner's original work the statistical mechanics predictions in
this directions were presented sa well. Here, through a mathematically rigorous
analysis, we confirm that the Gardner's predictions in this direction are in
fact provable upper bounds on the true values of the storage capacity.
Moreover, we then present a mechanism that can be used to lower these bounds.
Numerical results that we present indicate that the Garnder's storage capacity
predictions may, in a fairly wide range of parameters, be not that far away

several practical results are obtained as follows. First, I derive the
hyperbolic relation between the boundary dimension and form dimension of
cities. Using the relation, we can estimate the form dimension through the
boundary dimension and vice versa. Second, I derive the proper scales of
fractal dimension: the form dimension comes between 1.5 and 2, and the boundary

third is about 1.7071. The fractal dimension relation formulae are applied to
China's cities and the cities of the United Kingdom, and the computations are
consistent with the theoretical expectation. The formulae are useful in the

differentiated from Wilson's spatial interaction model deriving from

corresponds to the value of the power exponent of the law of gravity in

more acceptable than the negative exponential function as an impedance function

several desirable, yet previously-unexplored attributes. The underlying

coupling allows the penalty to automatically adjust its shape based on the
estimated degree of local blur and image structure such that regions with large

described by the kinetic partitioning mechanism according to which only a small
fraction ($\phi_F$) reaches the folded state while the remaining fraction of
molecules is kinetically trapped in misfolded intermediates. The transition
from the misfolded states to the native state can far exceed biologically
relevant time. Thus, RNA folding in vivo is often aided by protein cofactors,
called RNA chaperones, that can rescue RNAs from a multitude of misfolded
structures. We consider two models, based on chemical kinetics and chemical
master equation, for describing assisted folding. In the passive model,
applicable for class I substrates, transient interactions of misfolded
structures with RNA chaperones alone are sufficient to destabilize the
misfolded structures, thus entropically lowering the barrier to folding. For
this mechanism to be efficient the intermediate ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex
between collapsed RNA and protein cofactor should have optimal stability. We
also introduce an active model (suitable for stringent substrates with small
$\phi_F$), which accounts for the recent experimental findings on the action of
CYT-19 on the group I intron ribozyme, showing that RNA chaperones does not
discriminate between the misfolded and the native states. In the active model,
the RNA chaperone system utilizes chemical energy of ATP hydrolysis to
repeatedly bind and release misfolded and folded RNAs, resulting in substantial
increase of yield of the native state. The theory outlined here shows, in
accord with experiments, that in the steady state the native state does not
form with unit probability.

  Information Visualisation (2013)",,,,"cs.LG cs.HC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  This paper takes an information visualization perspective to visual
representations in the general SOM paradigm. This involves viewing SOM-based
visualizations through the eyes of Bertin's and Tufte's theories on data
graphics. The regular grid shape of the Self-Organizing Map (SOM), while being
a virtue for linking visualizations to it, restricts representation of cluster
structures. From the viewpoint of information visualization, this paper
provides a general, yet simple, solution to projection-based coloring of the
SOM that reveals structures. First, the proposed color space is easy to
construct and customize to the purpose of use, while aiming at being
perceptually correct and informative through two separable dimensions. Second,
the coloring method is not dependent on any specific method of projection, but
is rather modular to fit any objective function suitable for the task at hand.
The cluster coloring is illustrated on two datasets: the iris data, and welfare
and poverty indicators.

asymmetries can be significant with the right amount of new physics
contributions, a scenario that may be fine-tuned, but is still viable. A
model-independent fit to the current data allows different indirect CP
asymmetries in the above two decays. This could even be contributing to the
apparent tension between the difference CP asymmetries $\Delta A_{\rm CP}$
measured through the pion-tagged and muon-tagged data samples at the LHCb. This
also implies that the measurements of $A_\Gamma$ and $y_{\rm CP}$ in the $\pi^+
\pi^-$ and $K^+ K^-$ decay modes can be different, and averaging over these two

measurements in the $D$ meson sector needs to take into account the possibility
of different indirect CP asymmetries in the $\pi^+\pi^-$ and $K^+ K^-$

simplifying the payloads and placing less stringent demands on the thrusters.
We generalize LISA's time-delay interferometry to displacement-noise free

the data streams that cancel laser and acceleration noise. However, the
three-dimensional configuration makes orbit selection complicated. So far, only
a halo orbit near the Lagrangian point L1 has been found to be stable enough,
and this allows only short arms up to 1400 km. We derive the sensitivity curve
of OGO with this arm length, resulting in a peak sensitivity of about
$2\times10^{-23}\,\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ near 100 Hz. We compare this version of
OGO to the present generation of ground-based detectors and to some future
detectors. We also investigate the scientific potentials of such a detector,
which include observing gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences,
the stochastic background and pulsars as well as the possibility to test
alternative theories of gravity. We find a mediocre performance level for this
short-arm-length detector, between those of initial and advanced ground-based
detectors. Thus, actually building a space-based detector of this specific

We discuss proofs of two algorithms that sandwich $H$ between an upper-layer

  Richard Stong showed that the unique smallest-possible upper layer, denoted

determines whether or not the trivial subgroup is the only possible lower

staggered fermions. We explain how to generalize the method to staggered
fermions in a way which is consistent with the lattice symmetries, and
introduce a new type of lattice bilinear which transforms covariantly and
avoids mixing. We derive the consequences of lattice symmetries for the
propagator and vertices. We implement the method numerically for
hypercubic-smeared (HYP) and asqtad valence fermion actions, using lattices
with asqtad sea quarks generated by the MILC collaboration. We compare the
non-perturbative results so obtained to those from perturbation theory, using
both scale-independent ratios of bilinears (of which we calculate 26), and the
scale-dependent bilinears themselves. Overall, we find that one-loop
perturbation theory provides a successful description of the results for
HYP-fermions if we allow for a truncation error of roughly the size of the
square of the one-loop term (for ratios) or of size O(1) \times \alpha^2 (for
the bilinears themselves). Perturbation theory is, however, less successful at
describing the non-perturbative asqtad results.

provide an expressive rule-based knowledge representation framework, featuring
a formal, declarative and well-understood semantics. However, handling the
evolution of rule bases is still a largely open problem. The AGM framework for
belief change was shown to give inappropriate results when directly applied to
logic programs under a non-monotonic semantics such as the stable models. The
approaches to address this issue, developed so far, proposed update semantics
based on manipulating the syntactic structure of programs and rules.
  More recently, AGM revision has been successfully applied to a significantly
more expressive semantic characterisation of logic programs based on SE-models.
This is an important step, as it changes the focus from the evolution of a
syntactic representation of a rule base to the evolution of its semantic
content.
  In this paper, we borrow results from the area of belief update to tackle the
problem of updating (instead of revising) answer-set programs. We prove a
representation theorem which makes it possible to constructively define any
operator satisfying a set of postulates derived from Katsuno and Mendelzon's
postulates for belief update. We define a specific operator based on this
theorem, examine its computational complexity and compare the behaviour of this
operator with syntactic rule update semantics from the literature. Perhaps
surprisingly, we uncover a serious drawback of all rule update operators based
on Katsuno and Mendelzon's approach to update and on SE-models.

the measurement of a polarization signal can be reduced to the detection and
quantification of a deviation from uniformity of a distribution of measured
angles. We explore the statistics of such polarization measurements using Monte
Carlo simulations and chi-squared fitting methods. We compare our results to
those derived using the traditional probability density used to characterize
polarization measurements and quantify how they deviate as the intrinsic
modulation amplitude grows. We derive relations for the number of counts
required to reach a given detection level (parameterized by beta, the ""number
of sigma's"" of the measurement) appropriate for measuring the modulation
amplitude by itself (single interesting parameter case) or jointly with the
position angle (two interesting parameters case). We show that for the former
case when the intrinsic amplitude is equal to the well known minimum detectable
polarization (MDP) it is, on average, detected at the 3-sigma level. For the
latter case, when one requires a joint measurement at the same confidence
level, then more counts are needed than that required to achieve the MDP level.
This additional factor is amplitude-dependent, but is approximately 2.2 for
intrinsic amplitudes less than about 20%. It decreases slowly with amplitude
and is 1.8 when the amplitude is 50%. We find that the position angle
uncertainty at 1-sigma confidence is well described by the relation 28.5 (deg)

services such as voice, video etc., it is required to route such traffic over a
minimum delay path. In this paper we propose a routing metric for delay
sensitive services in IEEE 802.16 mesh networks. We design a new cross layer
routing metric, namely Expected Scheduler Delay (ESD), based on HoldOff
exponent and the current load at each node of the network. This proposed metric
takes into account the expected theoretical end-to-end delay of routing paths
as well as network congestion to find the best suited path. We propose an
efficient distributed scheme to calculate ESD and route the packets using
source routing mechanism based on ESD. The simulation results demonstrate that
our metric achieves reduced delay compared to a standard scheme used in IEEE
802.16 mesh, that takes hop count to find the path.

case with a general $\ell_q,0<q<1$, optimization. In our recent work

optimization can in fact provide a better performance than $\ell_1$, a fact
long believed to be true due to a tighter optimization relaxation it provides

Namely, we consider linear under-determined systems with sparse solutions. A
substantial success in mathematical characterization of an $\ell_1$
optimization technique typically used for solving such systems has been
achieved during the last decade. Seminal works \cite{CRT,DOnoho06CS} showed
that the $\ell_1$ can recover a so-called linear sparsity (i.e. solve systems
even when the solution has a sparsity linearly proportional to the length of
the unknown vector). Later considerations \cite{DonohoPol,DonohoUnsigned} (as
well as our own ones \cite{StojnicCSetam09,StojnicUpper10}) provided the
precise characterization of this linearity. In this paper we consider the
so-called structured version of the above sparsity driven problem. Namely, we
view a special case of sparse solutions, the so-called block-sparse solutions.
Typically one employs $\ell_2/\ell_1$-optimization as a variant of the standard
$\ell_1$ to handle block-sparse case of sparse solution systems. We considered
systems with block-sparse solutions in a series of work
\cite{StojnicCSetamBlock09,StojnicUpperBlock10,StojnicICASSP09block,StojnicJSTSP09}
where we were able to provide precise performance characterizations if the
$\ell_2/\ell_1$-optimization similar to those obtained for the standard
$\ell_1$ optimization in \cite{StojnicCSetam09,StojnicUpper10}. Here we look at
a similar class of systems where on top of being block-sparse the unknown
vectors are also known to have components of the same sign. In this paper we
slightly adjust $\ell_2/\ell_1$-optimization to account for the known signs and
provide a precise performance characterization of such an adjustment.

paste procedure to a regular charged black hole in nonlinear electrodynamics
field. We discuss different physical aspects of wormholes such as, the possible
equation of state to matter shell, attractive or repulsive nature of wormhole
and total amount of exotic matter required. The thin-shell equation of motion
with and without cosmological constant is also investigated under linearized
perturbation. Finally, we explore the stability regions interpreted by the
parameter $\beta$ (speed of sound) and conclude that there are realistic
stability regions for some fixed values of parameters.

time-domain traveling wave model of quarter wave-shifted distributed feedback
semiconductor lasers diode with a Gaussian distribution of the coupling
coefficient (GDCC) is presented. It is found that the single-mode behavior and
the more hole-burning effect corrections of quarter wave-shifted distributed
feedback laser with large coupling coefficient can be improved significantly by
this new proposed light source.

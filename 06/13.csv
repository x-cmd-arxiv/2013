algebroids when the fundamental geometric objects are completely determined by
(semi) Riemannian metrics, or effective) regular generating Lagrange/ Finsler,
functions. There are constructed canonical almost symplectic connections for
which the geometric flows can be represented as gradient ones and characterized
by nonholonomic deformations of Grigory Perelman's functionals. The first goal
of this paper is to define such thermodynamical type values and derive almost
K\""ahler - Ricci geometric evolution equations. The second goal is to study how
fixed Lie algebroid, i.e. Ricci soliton, configurations can be constructed for
Riemannian manifolds and/or (co) tangent bundles endowed with nonholonomic
distributions modelling (generalized) Einstein or Finsler - Cartan spaces.
Finally, there are provided some examples of generic off-diagonal solutions for
Lie algebroid type Ricci solitons and (effective) Einstein and Lagrange-Finsler
algebroids.

crucial for facilitating their diverse functions. How is the intrinsic
flexibility required for these motions encoded in their three-dimensional
structures? Here, the overall flexibility of a protein is demonstrated to be
tightly coupled to the total amount of surface area buried within its fold. A
simple proxy for this, the relative solvent accessible surface area (Arel),
therefore shows excellent agreement with independent measures of global protein
flexibility derived from various experimental and computational methods.
Application of Arel on a large scale demonstrates its utility by revealing
unique sequence and structural properties associated with intrinsic
flexibility. In particular, flexibility as measured by Arel shows little
correspondence with intrinsic disorder, but instead tends to be associated with
multiple domains and increased {\alpha}- helical structure. Furthermore, the
apparent flexibility of monomeric proteins is found to be useful for
identifying quaternary structure errors in published crystal structures. There
is also a strong tendency for the crystal structures of more flexible proteins
to be solved to lower resolutions. Finally, local solvent accessibility is
shown to be a primary determinant of local residue flexibility. Overall this
work provides both fundamental mechanistic insight into the origin of protein
flexibility and a simple, practical method for predicting flexibility from
protein structures.

relevance of the $\eta$-NE region is that it provides the set of rate-pairs

$\eta$-optimal individual transmission rate. Therefore, any rate tuple outside
the $\eta$-NE region is not stable as there always exists one link able to
increase by at least $\eta$ bits/s/Hz its own transmission rate by updating its

are: $(i)$ The $\eta$-NE region achieved with feedback is larger than or equal
to the $\eta$-NE region without feedback. More importantly, for each rate pair
achievable at an $\eta$-NE without feedback, there exists at least one rate
pair achievable at an $\eta$-NE with feedback that is weakly Pareto superior.

constrained optimization problem that must be solved at every point in a
space-time mesh, making it important to solve these optimization problems
accurately and efficiently. We present a complete and practical numerical
algorithm for solving the dual problem in one-dimensional, slab geometries. The
closure is only well-defined on the set of moments that are realizable from a
positive underlying distribution, and as the boundary of the realizable set is
approached, the dual problem becomes increasingly difficult to solve due to
ill-conditioning of the Hessian matrix. To improve the condition number of the
Hessian, we advocate the use of a change of polynomial basis, defined using a
Cholesky factorization of the Hessian, that permits solution of problems nearer
to the boundary of the realizable set. We also advocate a fixed quadrature
scheme, rather than adaptive quadrature, since the latter introduces
unnecessary expense and changes the computationally realizable set as the
quadrature changes. For very ill-conditioned problems, we use regularization to
make the optimization algorithm robust. We design a manufactured solution and
demonstrate that the adaptive-basis optimization algorithm reduces the need for
regularization. This is important since we also show that regularization slows,
and even stalls, convergence of the numerical simulation when refining the
space-time mesh. We also simulate two well-known benchmark problems. There we
find that our adaptive-basis, fixed-quadrature algorithm uses less
regularization than alternatives, although differences in the resulting
numerical simulations are more sensitive to the regularization strategy than to
the choice of basis.

There have been some graphical schemes resistant or immune to shoulder-surfing,
but they have significant usability drawbacks, usually in the time and effort
to log in. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a new shoulder-surfing
resistant scheme which has a desirable usability for PDAs. Our inspiration
comes from the drawing input method in DAS and the association mnemonics in
Story for sequence retrieval. The new scheme requires users to draw a curve
across their password images orderly rather than click directly on them. The
drawing input trick along with the complementary measures, such as erasing the
drawing trace, displaying degraded images, and starting and ending with
randomly designated images provide a good resistance to shouldersurfing. A
preliminary user study showed that users were able to enter their passwords
accurately and to remember them over time.

because little is known about mechanistic drivers of structured networks. Here
we contrast network properties derived from diffusion spectrum imaging data of
the human brain with 13 synthetic network models chosen to probe the roles of
physical network embedding and temporal network growth. We characterize both
the empirical and synthetic networks using familiar diagnostics presented in
statistical form, as scatter plots and distributions, to reveal the full range
of variability of each measure across scales in the network. We focus on the
degree distribution, degree assortativity, hierarchy, topological Rentian
scaling, and topological fractal scaling---in addition to several summary
statistics, including the mean clustering coefficient, shortest path length,
and network diameter. The models are investigated in a progressive, branching
sequence, aimed at capturing different elements thought to be important in the
brain, and range from simple random and regular networks, to models that
incorporate specific growth rules and constraints. We find that synthetic
models that constrain the network nodes to be embedded in anatomical brain
regions tend to produce distributions that are similar to those extracted from
the brain. We also find that network models hardcoded to display one network
property do not in general also display a second, suggesting that multiple
neurobiological mechanisms might be at play in the development of human brain

flavour universality violation in kaon decays. The additional mixing between
the active neutrinos and the sterile ones can generate deviations from
unitarity in the leptonic mixing matrix for charged currents. We reconsidered
this idea in the context of the inverse seesaw and evaluated its impact on the
well measured ratio $R_K$. We show that the current experimental bound can be
saturated in agreement with the different experimental and observational

factors that have to be considered when simulating an organism's

immunocompetence with age. We are trying to answer questions such as: Given a
certain age of a patient, how fit is their immune system to fight cancer? Would
an immune boost improve the effectiveness of a cancer treatment given the
patient's immune phenotype and age? We believe that understanding the processes
of immune system ageing and degradation through computer simulation may help in
answering these questions. Specifically, we have decided to look at the change
in numbers of naive T cells with age, as they play a important role in
responses to cancer and anti-tumour vaccination. In this work we present an
agent-based simulation model to understand the interactions which influence the
naive T cell populations over time. Our agent model is based on existing
mathematical system dynamic model, but in comparisons offers better scope for
customisation and detailed analysis. We believe that the results obtained can
in future help with the modelling of T cell populations inside tumours.

under repeated stirrings or perturbations, which has been shown to lead to a
convergence towards a limited group of end states. This so-called attractor was
previously shown to be independent of the initial system and environmental
conditions. However the fundamental reason for its appearance is still unclear.
It has been suggested that the origin of the attractor may be either radial
infall (RI), the radial orbit instability (ROI), or energy exchange which, for
instance, happens during violent relaxation. Here we examine the effects of a
set of controlled perturbations, referred to as `kicks', which act in addition
to the standard collisionless dynamics by allowing pre-specified instantaneous
perturbations in phase-space. We first demonstrate that the attractor persists
in the absence of RI and ROI by forcing the system to expand. We then consider
radial velocity kicks in a rigid potential and isotropic velocity kicks, since
there are no energy exchanges in these two recipes of kicks. We find that these
kicks do not lead to the attractor, indicating that the energy exchange in a
dynamic potential is indeed the physical mechanism responsible for the
attractor.

J1305-704. A rich absorption complex is detected in the Fe L band, including
density-sensitive lines from Fe XX, XXI, and XXII. Spectral analysis over three
bands with photoionization models generally requires a gas density of n > 1
E+17 cm^-3. Assuming a luminosity of L = 1 E+37 erg/s, fits to the 10-14 A band
constrain the absorbing gas to lie within r = 3.9(7) E+3 km from the central
engine, or about r = 520 +/- 90 (M/5 Msun) r_g, where r_g = GM/c^2. At this
distance from the compact object, gas in Keplerian orbits should have a
gravitational red-shift of z = v/c ~ 3 +/- 1 E-3 (M/5 Msun), and any tenuous
inflowing gas should have a free-fall velocity of v/c ~ 6 +/- 1 E-2 (M/5
Msun)^1/2. The best-fit single-zone photoionization models measure a red-shift
of v/c = 2.6-3.2 E-3. Models with two zones provide significantly improved
fits; the additional zone is measured to have a red-shift of v/c =4.6-4.9 E-2
(models including two zones suggest slightly different radii and may point to
lower densities). Thus, the shifts are broadly consistent with the
photoionization radius. The results may be explained in terms of a ""failed
wind"" like those predicted in some numerical simulations. We discuss our
results in the context of accretion flows across the mass scale, and the
potential role of failed winds in black hole state transitions.

happens along the anisotropic direction when the temperature is kept fixed.

Gross-Neveu model are studied in the presence of a constant magnetic field. The
optimized perturbation theory (OPT) is used to obtain results going beyond the
large-N approximation. The free energy and the complete phase diagram of the
model, in terms of temperature, chemical potential and magnetic field are
obtained and studied in details. By comparing the results from the OPT and the
large-N approximation, we conclude that finite N effects favor the phenomenon
of inverse magnetic catalysis when the coupling constant is negative. We show
that with the OPT the value of the coexistence chemical potential at vanishing
temperature always decreases with the magnetic field. This is opposite to what
is seen in the large-N approximation, where for large magnetic fields the
coexistence chemical potential starts again to increase. Likewise, at finite
temperature, the value of the chemical potential at the tricritical point also
decreases with the magnetic field in the OPT case. Consequently, the shape of
the phase diagrams predicted by the OPT and by the large-N approximation look
very different in the presence of high magnetic fields. Finally, for small
values of magnetic field and temperature, we identify the presence of possible
intermediate nonchiral phase transitions when varying the chemical potential.
We show that these phenomena are not an artifact of the large-N approximation
and that they also occur within the OPT framework. These intermediate
transitions are interpreted to be a consequence of the de Haas--van Alphen
oscillations. We also explain why this type of phenomenon can happen in general
for negative couplings but not for positive couplings.

dusty as inferred from the reddened spectrum of the background QSO. The z=2.412
DLA has a metallicity of [M/H]=-0.6 (based on ZnII and SiII). In this paper we
present new observations of this interesting sightline. HST/WFC3 imaging was
obtained in the F606W, F105W and F160W bands. This is complemented by
ground-based imaging in the u-, g-bands as well as K_s observations in the
near-infrared (NIR). In addition, we present further spectroscopy with the

following results: By fitting stellar population synthesis models to the
photometric SED we constrain the physical properties of the z=2.583 DLA galaxy,
and we infer its morphology by fitting a Sersic model to its surface brightness
profile. We find it to be a relatively massive (M_star 10^10 M_sun), strongly
star-forming (SFR~30 M_sun / yr, dusty (E_(B-V)=0.4) galaxy with a disk-like
morphology. We detect most of the strong emission lines from the z=2.583 DLA

[OIII],5007 emission from the galaxy counterpart of the z=2.412 DLA at a small

emerging picture that high-metallicity DLAs are associated with relatively
(compared to typical DLAs) luminous and massive galaxy counterparts.

show that the conformal Galileons in the two representations are mapped into

into a complete linear combination of all the five Galileons in the other

around non-trivial backgrounds is not the same in the two representations.

Radio-frequency driving can be used to induce tunneling between the spin
states. The Rabi oscillations are modified due to the coupling of the quantum
spin to the environment, which causes frequency renormalization and damping.
The spin-bath coupling can be widely tuned by adjusting the scattering length
through a Feshbach resonance. When the scattering potential creates a bound
state, by tuning the driving frequency it is possible to populate either the
ground state, in which the bound state is filled, or a metastable state in
which the bound state is empty. In the latter case, we predict an emergent
inversion of the steady-state magnetization. Our work shows that different

Follow-up spectroscopy of candidate group members is performed using VLT/FORS2.
From the resulting N=21 confirmed members we measure the group dynamical mass
by calibrating an analytic tracer mass estimator with cosmological simulations.
The luminosity weighted line-of-sight velocity dispersion and the Einstein
radius of the lens are used as mass probes in the inner regions of the galaxy.
Combining these three observational probes allows us to independently constrain
the mass and concentration of the dark matter halo, in addition to the total
stellar mass of the central galaxy. We find a dark matter halo in remarkably
good agreement with simulations (log_10 M_200/M_sun = 14.2 +/- 0.2, c_200 = 4.4
(+1.6, -1.4)) and a stellar mass-to-light ratio which favors a Salpeter initial
mass function ((M/L)* = 5.7 +/- 1.2). Our measurement of a normal halo
concentration suggests that there is no discrepancy between simulations and
observations at the group mass scale. This is in contrast to the cluster mass
scale for which a number of studies have claimed over-concentrated halos. While
the halo mass is robustly determined, and the halo concentration is not
significantly affected by systematics, the resulting stellar mass-to-light
ratio is sensitive to the choice of stellar parameters, such as density profile

uncertainties, and provides accurate parameter estimates for both individual

estimate Sigma_SFR and Sigma_mol from the observations, we find that the KS
parameters vary between galaxies, indicating that no universal relationship
holds for all galaxies. The KS slope of the whole population is 0.76, with the
2sigma range extending from 0.58 to 0.94. These results imply that the
molecular gas depletion time is not constant, but varies from galaxy to galaxy,
and increases with the molecular gas surface density. Therefore, other galactic
properties besides just Sigma_mol affect Sigma_SFR, such as the gas fraction or
stellar mass. The non-universality of the KS relationship indicates that a
comprehensive theory of star formation must take into account additional
physical processes that may vary from galaxy to galaxy.

Eddington-limited accretion driven by stochastic collisions with massive, dense
clouds. We predict that these gas-rich disks host weak AGNs 1/4 of the time,
and moderate/strong AGNs 10% of the time. Averaged over 100 Myr timescales and
the full distribution of accretion rates, the black holes grow at a few per

galaxies on the MBH-Mbulge relation. This suggests that dense cloud accretion
in isolated z=2 disks could dominate cosmic black hole growth. In z=0 disks
with fgas=10%, Eddington-limited growth is extremely rare because typical gas
clouds are smaller and more susceptible to disruption by AGN feedback. This
results in an average black hole growth rate in high-fgas galaxies that is up
to 1000 times higher than that in low-fgas galaxies. In all our simulations,
accretion shows variability by factors of 10^4 on a variety of time scales,
with variability at 1 Myr scales driven by the structure of the interstellar
medium.

low density regions. This property makes this class of codes excellent tools to
study the formation and evolution of cosmic voids. Following such ideas, we
present the results of an Eulerian adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)
hydrodynamical and N-body simulation, that contrary to the common practice, has
been designed to refine the computational grid in the underdense regions of the
simulated volume. Thus, the void regions are better described due to the
combined effect of the Eulerian character of the numerical technique and the
use of high numerical resolution from the AMR approach. To analyse the outcome
of this simulation, we have constructed a new void finder optimally suited to
find the hierarchy of voids in AMR simulations. The algorithm identifies voids
starting from the cells with least density and highest velocity divergence and
then expanding the underdense volume until reaching the void walls, defined
from the steepness of the density gradient. At redshift z=0, in a cosmological
box of comoving side length 100 Mpc/h, we identify hundreds of voids with sizes
up to 17 Mpc/h and typical density contrast of -0.8, which show a complex
morphology and an intricate hierarchy of nested structures. The analysis of
their mass density profile leads to the conclusion that a universal density
profile can be applied to voids of any size, density, morphology and redshift.

GeV. Over the past decade, attempts to interpret this positron excess in terms
of dark-matter decays have become increasingly complex and have led to a number
of general expectations about the decaying dark-matter particles: such
particles cannot undergo simple two-body decays to leptons, for example, and
they must have rather heavy TeV-scale masses. In this paper, by contrast, we
show that Dynamical Dark Matter (DDM) can not only match existing AMS-02 data
on the positron excess, but also accomplish this feat with significantly
lighter dark-matter constituents undergoing simple two-body decays to leptons.
Moreover, we demonstrate that this can be done without running afoul of
numerous other competing constraints from FERMI and Planck on decaying dark
matter. Finally, we demonstrate that the Dynamical Dark Matter framework makes
a fairly robust prediction that the positron fraction should level off and then
remain roughly constant out to approximately 1 TeV, without experiencing any
sharp downturns. Indeed, if we interpret the positron excess in terms of
decaying dark matter, we find that the existence of a plateau in the positron
fraction at energies less than 1 TeV may be taken as a ""smoking gun"" of
Dynamical Dark Matter.

Parke-Taylor-like factors, Vandermonde determinants and resultants. Integrating
out some of the Grassmann directions produces formulas for theories with less

Combining all four basic structures we start a search for consistent S-matrices

to ABJM and BLG theories. We also make a connection between the power of a
resultant in the integrand, representations of the Poincar\'e group, infrared

find significant halo-to-halo diversity in mass reionization histories, and
find that in realistic inhomogenous models, the material within a given halo is
not expected to reionize at the same time. In particular, the scatter in
reionization times within individual halos is typically larger than the scatter
among halos. From our fiducial reionization model, we find that the typical 68%

valid for stars with spectral types A0 to M4. To derive even more accurate
relations for Sun-like stars, we also determined these temperature relations

~2.5%. We find effective temperatures in agreement within a couple percent for

constraints us to implement myopic, greedy-like algorithms. A simple
deterministic greedy algorithm achieves a factor 1/2 which is tight for
deterministic algorithms. An important open question in this direction is to
give a randomized greedy algorithm that has a significantly better
approximation factor. This question was first asked almost 20 years ago by Dyer

edges uniformly at random doesn't help and has an approximation factor of 1/2 +
o(1). They left it as an open question to devise a better randomized greedy

long-time limit. The exponent beta depends on the opening angle of the cone and
the spatial dimension, and it is root of a transcendental equation involving
the associated Legendre functions. The exponent becomes a function of a single
scaling variable in the limit of large spatial dimension. We then describe two
first-passage problems involving the order of N independent Brownian particles
in one dimension where survival probabilities decay algebraically as well. To
analyze these problems, we identify the trajectories of the N particles with
the trajectory of one particle in N dimensions, confined to within a certain
boundary, and we use a circular cone with matching solid angle as a replacement
for the confining boundary. For N=3, the confining boundary is a wedge and the
approach is exact. In general, this ""cone approximation"" gives strict lower
bounds as well as useful estimates or the first-passage exponents.
Interestingly, the cone approximation becomes asymptotically exact when

relations between three physical properties of a system can be represented by
complex conditional probabilities. Here, it is shown that these relations
provide a fully deterministic and universally valid framework on which all of
quantum mechanics can be based. Specifically, quantum mechanics can be derived
by combining the rules of Bayesian probability theory with only a single
additional law that explains the phases of complex probabilities. This law,
which I introduce here as the law of quantum ergodicity, is based on the
observation that the reality of physical properties cannot be separated from
the dynamics by which they emerge in measurement interactions. The complex
phases are an expression of this inseparability and represent the dynamical
structure of transformations between the different properties. In its
quantitative form, the law of quantum ergodicity describes a fundamental
relation between the ergodic probabilities obtained by dynamical averaging and
the deterministic relations between three properties expressed by the complex
conditional probabilities. The complete formalism of quantum mechanics can be
derived from this one relation, without any axiomatic mathematical assumptions
about state vectors or superpositions. It is therefore possible to explain all
quantum phenomena as the consequence of a single fundamental law of physics.

five dimensional procedure, which consistently introduce coordinates and
momenta in the corresponding four-dimensional phase space, via a Hamiltonian
approach. For the one particle case, the starting point is a de Sitter momentum
space in five dimensions, with an additional constraint selected to recover the
mass shell condition in four dimensions. Different basis of DSR can be
recovered by selecting specific gauges to define the reduced four dimensional
degrees of freedom. This is shown for the Snyder basis in the one particle
case. We generalize the method to the many particles case and apply it again to
this basis. We show that the energy and momentum of the system, given by the
dynamical variables that are generators of translations in space and time and
which close the Poincar\'e algebra, are additive magnitudes. From this it
results that the rest energy (mass) of a composite object does not have an
upper limit, as opposed to a single component particle which does.

increasingly mature, a multi-messenger era of astronomy is ushered in. Advanced
gravitational wave detectors are close to making a ground-breaking discovery of
gravitational wave bursts (GWBs) associated with mergers of double neutron
stars (NS-NS). It is essential to study the possible electromagnetic (EM) and
neutrino emission counterparts of these GWBs. Recent observations and numerical
simulations suggest that at least a fraction of NS-NS mergers may leave behind
a massive millisecond magnetar as the merger product. Here we show that protons
accelerated in the forward shock powered by a magnetar wind pushing the ejecta
launched during the merger process would interact with photons generated in the
dissipating magnetar wind and emit high energy neutrinos and photons. We
estimate the typical energy and fluence of the neutrinos from such a scenario.
We find that $\sim$PeV neutrinos could be emitted from the shock front as long
as the ejecta could be accelerated to a relativistic speed. The diffuse
neutrino flux from these events, even under the most optimistic scenarios, is
too low to account for the two events announced by the IceCube Collaboration,
but it is only slightly lower than the diffuse flux of GRBs, making it an
important candidate for the diffuse background of $\sim$PeV neutrinos. The
neutron-pion decay of these events make them a moderate contributor to the
sub-TeV gamma-ray diffuse background.

(RR), random removal and preferential addition (RP), targeted removal and
random addition (TR), and targeted removal and preferential addition (TP). We
find that cooperation clusters are most fragile against TR, while they are most
robust against RP, even for large values of the temptation coefficient for
defection. The effect of the degree mixing pattern of the network is not the
primary factor for the robustness of cooperation under continuous change in
network topology, which is quite different from the cases observed in static
networks. Cooperation clusters become more robust as the number of links of
hubs occupied by cooperators increase. Our results might infer the fact that a
huge variety of individuals is needed for maintaining global cooperation in

Ionization plays a central role in the gas-phase chemistry of

observations of the high-mass star-forming region NGC 6334 I to derive the
abundance of two of the most abundant molecular ions, HCO+ and N2H+, and
consequently, the cosmic ray ionization rate. In addition, the line profiles
provide information about the kinematics of this region. Methods. We present
high-resolution spectral line observations conducted with the HIFI instrument
on board the Herschel Space Observatory of the rotational transitions with Jup
> 5 of the molecular species C17O, C18O, HCO+, H13CO+, and N2H+. Results. The
HCO+ and N2H+ line profiles display a redshifted asymmetry consistent with a
region of expanding gas. We identify two emission components in the spectra,
each with a different excitation, associated with the envelope of NGC 6334 I.
The physical parameters obtained for the envelope are in agreement with
previous models of the radial structure of NGC 6334 I based on submillimeter
continuum observations. Based on our new Herschel/HIFI observations, combined
with the predictions from a chemical model, we derive a cosmic ray ionization
rate that is an order of magnitude higher than the canonical value of 10^(-17)
s-1. Conclusions. We find evidence of an expansion of the envelope surrounding
the hot core of NGC 6334 I, which is mainly driven by thermal pressure from the
hot ionized gas in the region. The ionization rate seems to be dominated by
cosmic rays originating from outside the source, although X-ray emission from
the NGC 6334 I core could contribute to the ionization in the inner part of the

conducted on random Euclidean instances, but little is known about metric
instances drawn from distributions other than the Euclidean. This motivates our
study of random metric instances for optimization problems obtained as follows:
Every edge of a complete graph gets a weight drawn independently at random. The
distance between two nodes is then the length of a shortest path (with respect
to the weights drawn) that connects these nodes.
  We prove structural properties of the random shortest path metrics generated
in this way. Our main structural contribution is the construction of a good
clustering. Then we apply these findings to analyze the approximation ratios of
heuristics for matching, the traveling salesman problem (TSP), and the k-median
problem, as well as the running-time of the 2-opt heuristic for the TSP. The
bounds that we obtain are considerably better than the respective worst-case
bounds. This suggests that random shortest path metrics are easy instances,
similar to random Euclidean instances, albeit for completely different

the marginal densities and the joint dependence to be modeled separately.
However, they usually require that the transformation from uniform marginals to
the marginals of the joint dependence structure is known. This can only be done
for a restricted set of copulas, e.g. a normal copula. Our article introduces
copula-type estimators for flexible multivariate density estimation which also
allow the marginal densities to be modeled separately from the joint
dependence, as in copula modeling, but overcomes the lack of flexibility of
most popular copula estimators. An iterative scheme is proposed for estimating
copula-type estimators and its usefulness is demonstrated through simulation
and real examples. The joint dependence is is modeled by mixture of normals and
mixture of normals factor analyzers models, and mixture of t and mixture of t
factor analyzers models. We develop efficient Variational Bayes algorithms for
fitting these in which model selection is performed automatically. Based on
these mixture models, we construct four classes of copula-type densities which
are far more flexible than current popular copula densities, and outperform
them in simulation and several real data sets.

galaxies, are expensive both in time and cost. This raises questions regarding
the optimal investment of this time and money for future surveys. In a previous
work, it was shown that a sparse sampling strategy could be a powerful
substitute for the contiguous observations. However, in this previous paper a
regular sparse sampling was investigated, where the sparse observed patches
were regularly distributed on the sky. The regularity of the mask introduces a
periodic pattern in the window function, which induces periodic correlations at
specific scales. In this paper, we use the Bayesian experimental design to
investigate a random sparse sampling, where the observed patches are randomly
distributed over the total sparsely sampled area. We find that, as there is no
preferred scale in the window function, the induced correlation is evenly
distributed amongst all scales. This could be desirable if we are interested in
specific scales in the galaxy power spectrum, such as the Baryonic Acoustic
Oscillation (BAO) scales. However, for constraining the overall galaxy power
spectrum and the cosmological parameters, there is no preference over regular
or random sampling. Hence any approach that is practically more suitable can be
chosen and we can relax the regular-grid condition for the distribution of the
observed patches.

  Rev. C",,"10.1103/PhysRevC.88.025206",,"hep-ph nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: Unravelling the role played by nonvalence flavors in baryons is
crucial in deepening our comprehension of QCD. Strange quark, a component of
the higher Fock states in baryons, is an appropriate tool to investigate
nonperturbative mechanisms generated by the pure sea quark.
  Purpose: Study the magnitude and the sign of the strangeness magnetic moment
$\mu_s$ and the magnetic form factor ($G_M^s$) of the proton.
  Methods: Within an extended chiral constituent quark model, we investigate
contributions from all possible five-quark components to $\mu_s$ and $G_M^s
(Q^2)$ in the four-vector momentum range $Q^2 \leq 1$ (GeV/c)$^2$. Probability
of the strangeness component in the proton wave function is calculated
employing the $^3 P_0$ model.
  Results: Predictions are obtained without any adjustable parameters.
Observables $\mu_s$ and $G_M^s (Q^2)$ are found to be small and negative,
consistent with the lattice-QCD findings as well as with the latest data
released by the PVA4 and HAPPEX Collaborations.
  Conclusions: Due to sizeable cancelations among different configurations
contributing to the strangeness magnetic moment of the proton, it is
indispensable to (i) take into account all relevant five-quark components and
include both diagonal and non-diagonal terms, (ii) handle with care the
oscillator harmonic parameter $\omega_5$ and the ${s \bar s}$ component
probability.

classical links from the Rota-Baxter associative algebra to the dendriform
algebra and its numerous generalizations are further generalized and unified as
the link from the Rota-Baxter operator on an operad to the splitting of the

beyond mean-field calculations. However, in the HFB transformation, the $U,V$
matrices are sometimes singular due to the exact emptiness ($v_i=0$) or full
occupation ($u_i=0$) of some single-particle orbits. This singularity may cause
some problem in evaluating the overlap between HFB vacua through Pfaffian. We
found that this problem can be well avoided by setting those zero occupation
numbers to some tiny values (e.g., $u_i,v_i=10^{-8}$). This treatment does not
change the HFB vacuum state because $u_i^2,v_i^2=10^{-16}$ are numerically zero
relative to 1. Therefore, for arbitrary HFB transformation, we say that the
$U,V$ matrices can always be nonsingular. From this standpoint, we present a
new convenient Pfaffian formula for the overlap between arbitrary HFB vacua,
which is especially suitable for symmetry restoration. Testing calculations
have been performed for this new formula. It turns out that our method is
reliable and accurate in evaluating the overlap between arbitrary HFB vacua.

investigation of semi-algebraic sets, with applications within algebraic
geometry and beyond. We recently reported on a new implementation of CAD in
Maple which implemented the original algorithm of Collins and the subsequent
improvement to projection by McCallum. Our implementation was in contrast to
Maple's in-built CAD command, based on a quite separate theory. Although
initially developed as an investigative tool to compare the algorithms, we
found and reported that our code offered functionality not currently available
in any other existing implementations. One particularly important piece of
functionality is the ability to produce order-invariant CADs. This has allowed
us to extend the implementation to produce CADs invariant with respect to
either equational constraints (ECCADs) or the truth-tables of sequences of
formulae (TTICADs). This new functionality is contained in the second release
of our code, along with commands to consider problem formulation which can be a
major factor in the tractability of a CAD. In the report we describe the new
functionality and some theoretical discoveries it prompted. We describe how the
CADs produced using equational constraints are able to take advantage of not
just improved projection but also improvements in the lifting phase. We also
present an extension to the original TTICAD algorithm which increases both the
applicability of TTICAD and its relative benefit over other algorithms. The

variation in condition, morphology and genetic variables influenced the amount
of antibodies produced against two novel antigens in a migrating bird, the

a good energy resolution and a detailed topological information of each event.
The ionization topology of the double beta decay event of 136Xe in gaseous

ending up in two higher ionization charge density blobs. With a properly
pixelized readout, this topological information is invaluable to perform
powerful background discrimination. In this study we carry out detailed

gamma events that typically compose the background at these energies. We define
observables based on graph theory concepts and develop automated discrimination
algorithms which reduce the background level in around three orders of

competitiveness of current or future double beta experiments based on gas TPCs,

Robertson-Walker spacetime, while its matter/energy content is modeled by a
perfect fluid with three components corresponding to matter/dust, radiation and
a cosmological constant. On the other hand, in particle physics matter and
radiation are described in terms of quantum field theory on Minkowski
spacetime. We unify these seemingly different theoretical frameworks by
analysing the standard model of cosmology from first principles within quantum
field theory on curved spacetime: assuming that the universe is homogeneous and
isotropic on large scales, we specify a class of quantum states whose
expectation value of the energy density is qualitatively and quantitatively of
the standard perfect fluid form up to potential corrections. Qualitatively,
these corrections depend on new parameters not present in the standard Lambda
CDM-model and can account for e.g. the phenomenon of Dark Radiation
(N_eff>3.046), having a characteristic signature which clearly deviates from
other potential Dark Radiation sources such as e.g. sterile neutrinos.
Quantitatively, we find that our more fundamental model can be perfectly
matched to observational data, such that we arrive at a natural and fundamental
extension of the Lambda CDM-model.

interpretation are problematic for several well-known reasons. Since the
Hilbert space formalism almost inevitably forces an instrumentalist
interpretation on us, we suggest that a theory of quantum gravity should not be
based on the Hilbert space formalism. We briefly sketch the topos approach,
which makes use of the internal logic of a topos associated with a quantum
system and comes with a natural (neo-)realist interpretation. Finally, we make
some remarks on the relation between system logic and metalogic.

reference to laboratory experiments, by means of a chemical stochastic model.
We focus on ants behavior as an interesting topic in order to predict the
ecological evolution of invasive species and their spreading. In our work we
want to describe the interactions between two groups of different ant species
with different war strategies. Our model considers the single ant individuals
and fighting groups in a way similar to atoms and molecules, respectively,
considering that ant fighting groups remain stable for a relative long time.
Starting from a system of differential non-linear equations (DE), derived from
the chemical reactions, we obtain a mean field description of the system. The
DE approach is valid when the number of individuals of each species is large in
the considered unit, while we consider battles of at most 10 vs. 10
individuals, due to the difficulties in following the individual behavior in a
large assembly. Therefore, we also adapt a Gillespie algorithm to reproduce the
fluctuations around the mean field. The DE scheme is exploited to characterize
the stochastic model. The set of parameters of chemical equations, obtained
using a minimization algorithm, are used by the Gillespie algorithm to generate
the stochastic trajectories. We then fit the stochastic paths with the DE, in
order to analyze the variability of the parameters and their variance. Finally,
we estimate the goodness of the applied methodology and we confirm that the
stochastic approach must be considered for a correct description of the ant
fighting dynamics. With respect to other war models, our chemical one considers
all phases of the battle and not only casualties. Thus, we can count on more
experimental data, but we also have more parameters to fit. In any case, our
model allows a much more detailed description of the fights.

of quark matter nucleation during the formation of compact stellar objects and
also for the existence of a mixed phase within hybrid stars. However, despite
its importance, this quantity does not have a well established numerical value.
Some early estimates have predicted that, at zero temperature, the value falls
within the wide range $\gamma_0\approx10-300{\rm\ MeV/fm^2}$ but, very
recently, different model applications have reduced these numerical values to
fall within the range $\gamma_0\approx5-30{\rm\ MeV/fm^2}$ which would favor
the phase conversion process as well as the appearance of a mixed phase in
hybrid stars. In magnetars one should also account for the presence of very
high magnetic fields which may reach up to about $ eB\approx 3-30\, m_\pi^2$
($B \approx 10^{19}-10^{20} \,G$) at the core of the star so that it may also
be important to analyze how the presence of a magnetic field affects the
surface tension. With this aim we consider magnetized two flavor quark matter,
described by the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. We show that although the surface
tension oscillates around its B=0 value, when $0 < eB \lesssim 10 \, m_\pi^2$,
it only reaches values which are still relatively small. For $eB \approx 5\,
m_\pi^2$ the B=0 surface tension value drops by about 30% while for $eB \gtrsim
10\, m_\pi^2$ it quickly raises with the field intensity so that the phase
conversion and the presence of a mixed phase should be suppressed if extremely
high fields are present. We also investigate how thermal effects influence the
surface tension for magnetized quark matter.

time-slotted system with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer.
In particular, in each time slot, a single user is scheduled to receive
information, while the remaining users opportunistically harvest the ambient
radio frequency (RF) energy. We devise novel scheduling schemes in which the
tradeoff between the users' ergodic capacities and their average amount of
harvested energy can be controlled. To this end, we modify two fair scheduling
schemes used in information-only transfer systems. First, proportionally fair
maximum normalized signal-to-noise ratio (N-SNR) scheduling is modified by
scheduling the user having the jth ascendingly ordered (rather than the
maximum) N-SNR. We refer to this scheme as order-based N-SNR scheduling.
Second, conventional equal-throughput (ET) fair scheduling is modified by
scheduling the user having the minimum moving average throughput among the set
of users whose N-SNR orders fall into a certain set of allowed orders Sa
(rather than the set of all users). We refer to this scheme as order-based ET
scheduling. The feasibility conditions required for the users to achieve ET
with this scheme are also derived. We show that the smaller the selection order
j for the order-based N-SNR scheme, and the lower the orders in Sa for the
order-based ET scheme, the higher the average amount of energy harvested by the
users at the expense of a reduction in their ergodic capacities. We analyze the
performance of the considered scheduling schemes for independent and
non-identically distributed (i.n.d.) Ricean fading channels, and provide
closed-form results for the special case of i.n.d. Rayleigh fading.

13 were confirmed to be background stars by measurement of their proper motion.
One was not found in the second epoch observation, and thus was not a

its proper motion was not sufficient to conclude whether it was background
object. Four other candidates are waiting for second epoch observations to
determine their proper motion. Finally, the remaining 2 were confirmed to be 60
$M_{J}$ brown dwarf companions orbiting around HD 23514 (G0) and HII 1348 (K5)

the average detection limit for a point source was 20.3 mag in the $H$ band
beyond 1''.5 from the central star. On the basis of this detection limit, we
calculated the detection efficiency to be 90% for a planet with 6 to 12 Jovian
masses and a semi-major axis of 50--1000 AU. For this we extrapolated the
distribution of planet mass and semi-major axis derived from RV observations

610 MHz. A small scale relic (~200 kpc) is suspected in the cluster Z348. We do
not detect cluster-scale diffuse emission in 11 clusters. Robust upper limits
on the detection of radio halo of size of 1 Mpc are determined. We also present
upper limits on the detections of mini-halos in a sub-sample of cool-core
clusters. The upper limits for radio halos and mini-halos are plotted in the
radio power- X-ray luminosity plane and the correlations are discussed. Diffuse
extended emission, not related to the target clusters, but detected as
by-products in the sensitive images of two of the cluster fields (A689 and
RXJ0439.0+0715) are reported. Based on the information about the presence of
radio halos (or upper limits), available on 48 clusters out of the total sample
of 67 clusters (EGRHS+GRHS), we find that ~23% of the clusters host radio
halos. The radio halo fraction rises to ~31%, when only the clusters with X-ray

mergers play an important role in the generation of radio halos/relics.

central problem in machine learning, since the success of many machine learning
algorithms critically depends on the choice of a similarity function to compare
examples. Despite many approaches for similarity metric learning have been
proposed, there is little theoretical study on the links between similarity
met- ric learning and the classification performance of the result classifier.
In this paper, we propose a regularized similarity learning formulation
associated with general matrix-norms, and establish their generalization
bounds. We show that the generalization error of the resulting linear separator
can be bounded by the derived generalization bound of similarity learning. This
shows that a good gen- eralization of the learnt similarity function guarantees
a good classification of the resulting linear classifier. Our results extend
and improve those obtained by Bellet at al. [3]. Due to the techniques
dependent on the notion of uniform stability [6], the bound obtained there
holds true only for the Frobenius matrix- norm regularization. Our techniques
using the Rademacher complexity [5] and its related Khinchin-type inequality
enable us to establish bounds for regularized similarity learning formulations
associated with general matrix-norms including sparse L 1 -norm and mixed
(2,1)-norm.

space whose coherence is as small as possible, equaling the Welch bound. Also
known as Welch-bound-equality sequences, such frames arise in various
applications, such as waveform design and compressed sensing. At the moment,
there are only two known flexible methods for constructing ETFs: harmonic ETFs
are formed by carefully extracting rows from a discrete Fourier transform;
Steiner ETFs arise from a tensor-like combination of a combinatorial design and
a regular simplex. These two classes seem very different: the vectors in
harmonic ETFs have constant amplitude, whereas Steiner ETFs are extremely
sparse. We show that they are actually intimately connected: a large class of
Steiner ETFs can be unitarily transformed into constant-amplitude frames,
dubbed Kirkman ETFs. Moreover, we show that an important class of harmonic ETFs
is a subset of an important class of Kirkman ETFs. This connection informs the
discussion of both types of frames: some Steiner ETFs can be transformed into
constant-amplitude waveforms making them more useful in waveform design; some
harmonic ETFs have low spark, making them less desirable for compressed
sensing. We conclude by showing that real-valued constant-amplitude ETFs are
equivalent to binary codes that achieve the Grey-Rankin bound, and then

this distinction, through the amplitude of the DEM slope coolward of the

associated with these measurements. Using proper estimations of the
uncertainties involved in the problem of DEM inversion, we derive confidence
levels on the observed DEM slope. Results show that the uncertainty in the

conditions for a microscopic traffic model and contrast it with empirical
results. By evaluating the time series of local measurements, the local traffic
states are assigned to the different traffic phases of Kerner's three-phase
traffic theory. For this classification we use the rule-based FOTO-method,
which provides `hard' rules for this assignment. Using this approach, our
analysis shows that the model is indeed able to reproduce three qualitatively
different traffic phases: free flow (F), synchronized traffic (S), and wide
moving jams (J). In addition, we investigate the likelihood of transitions
between the three traffic phases. We show that a transition from free flow (F)
to a wide moving jam (J) often involves an intermediate transition; first from
free flow F to synchronized flow S and then from synchronized flow to a wide
moving jam. This is supported by the fact that the so called F->S transition
(from free flow to synchronized traffic) is much more likely than a direct F->J
transition.
  The model under consideration has a functional relation between traffic flow
and traffic density. The fundamental hypothesis of the three-phase traffic
theory, however, postulates that the steady states of synchronized flow occupy
a two-dimensional region in the flow-density plane. Due to the obvious
discrepancy between the model investigated here and the postulate of the
three-phase traffic theory, the good agreement that we found could not be
expected. For a more detailed analysis, we also studied the vehicle dynamics at
a microscopic level and provide a comparison of real detector data with

circular polarization. Its period is only several decades millisecond.
Particularly, before and after the pulsation, there are many spectral fine
structures, such as zebra patterns, fibers, and millisecond spikes. The
microwave Z-QPP can provide some kinematic information of the source region in
the early rising phase of the flare, and the source width changes from about
1000 km to 3300 km, even if we have no imaging observations. The abundant
spectral fine structures possibly reflect the dynamic features of non-thermal
particles.

In addition to previously published work, it contains introductions to the
following topics: from classical mechanics to quantum field theory for the more
casual reader, electroweak naturalness, the Higgs as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone
boson, the MSSM and NMSSM, simple and less simple models of gauge-mediated Susy
breaking (GMSB), collider searches for Susy and other new theories, transverse
mass observables with missing energy, and Brazil-band plots. The previously
published work is as follows.
  The optimally natural Higgs-stop sector in the MSSM in light of the 2012
discovery of a Higgs boson is derived, namely that of almost maximal mixing,
with the scalar top partners almost as light as can be. The discovery is also
interpreted numerically in the NMSSM, with greater emphasis placed on the
visibility of the Higgs boson at the observed mass, i.e. on signal strengths. I
investigate the role played by the mediation scale of GMSB: this is found to be
as a control of the extent to which Yukawa couplings de-tune flavour-blind
relations set by gauge couplings. Finally, issues relating to the discovery or
exclusion of Susy at colliders are discussed. Bounds are derived for the masses
of new particles from LHC searches for excesses of jets and missing energy
without leptons, and compared to constraints arising from Higgs boson searches,
for models of GMSB and the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. I
present a novel search strategy for new physics signatures with two neutral,
stable particles, when such particles are produced by boosted decays. (Susy
motivations include models with light gravitinos, pseudo-goldstinos, singlinos
or new photinos.) The method is shown to produce sharp mass peaks that enhance
the visibility of the signal, with mass reconstruction to 5% from O(100)
events.

polytope using extra variables besides the variables in which the polytope is

development of methods for, on the one hand, constructing extended formulations

important type of a digital sequence, this kind of duality principle leads to
the so-called $\mathbf b$-adic function system and provides the basis for the

This method employs structural properties of the compact group of $\mathbf

analysis of the uniform distribution of sequences in $[0,1)^s$.
  We first clarify the point which function systems are needed to analyze
digital sequences. Then, we present the hybrid spectral test in terms of
trigonometric-, Walsh-, and $\mathbf b$-adic functions. Various notions of
diaphony as well as many figures of merit for rank-1 quadrature rules in
Quasi-Monte Carlo integration and for certain linear types of pseudo-random

Further, discrepancy may be approximated arbitrarily close by suitable versions

For a fixed value of the gauge field, we observe that when the strength of the
repulsive interaction is increased, the system enters into an antiferromagnetic
phase, then undergoes a first order phase transition to an non collinear
magnetic phase. Depending on the gauge field parameter, this phase further
evolves to the one predicted from the effective Heisenberg model obtained in
the limit of large interaction strength. We explain the presence of the
antiferromagnetic phase at small interaction from the computation of the
spin-spin susceptibility which displays a divergence at low temperatures for
the antiferromagnetic ordering. We discuss, how the divergence is related to
the nature of the underlying Fermi surfaces. Finally, the fact that the first
order phase transitions for different gauge field parameters occur at unrelated
critical interaction strengths arises from a Hofstadter-like situation, i.e.
for different magnetic phases, the mean-field Hamiltonians have different

resource is shared by multiple parties. In such naturally information-limited
settings, parties abide by a behavioral protocol that leads to fair sharing of
the resource. However, greedy players may defect from a cooperative protocol
and achieve a greater than fair share of resources, often without significant
adverse consequences to themselves. In this paper, we study the role of a few
vigilante players who also defect from a cooperative resource-sharing protocol
but only in response to perceived greedy behavior. For a simple model of
engagement, we demonstrate surprisingly complex dynamics among greedy and
vigilante players. We show that the best response function for the
greedy-player under our formulation has a jump discontinuity, which leads to
conditions under which there is no Nash equilibrium. To study this property, we
formulate an exact representation for the greedy player best response function
in the case when there is one greedy player, one vigilante player and $N-2$
cooperative players. We use this formulation to show conditions under which a
Nash equilibrium exists. We also illustrate that in the case when there is no
Nash equilibrium, then the discrete dynamic system generated from fictitious
play will not converge, but will oscillate indefinitely as a result of the jump
discontinuity. The case of multiple vigilante and greedy players is studied
numerically. Finally, we explore the relationship between fictitious play and
the better response dynamics (gradient descent) and illustrate that this
dynamical system can have a fixed point even when the discrete dynamical system
arising from fictitious play does not.

the pure Dresselhaus case [Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 076805 (2005)]. Since the
Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling dominates over the Rashba spin-orbit coupling
in GaAs and GaSb QDs, it is important to find the exact location of the

this paper, for the first time, we present analytical and numerical results
that show that the spin-hot spot can also be seen for the pure Dresselhaus

At or nearby the spin-hot spot, the spin transition rate enhances and the
decoherence time reduces by several orders of magnitude compared to the case
with no spin-hot spot. Thus one should avoid such locations when designing QD
spin based transistors for the possible implementation in quantum logic gates,
solid state quantum computing and quantum information processing. It is also

hot gaseous halo using parameters typical for Lyman break galaxies (LBGs). We
take into account the (static) gravitational potentials due to a dark matter
halo, a stellar bulge and a disc of stars and gas. Star formation is treated by
a local Kennicutt-Schmidt law. We simplify the structure of the interstellar
medium by restricting the computational domain to a 25th of the full azimuthal
angle, effectively assuming large-scale axisymmetry and neglecting any effects
of spiral structure, and focus on the large-scale ISM drivers, the
superbubbles. Supernovae are triggered randomly and have preset event sizes of
several tens to hundreds. We further investigate different halo gas pressures
and energy injection methods. Many of our simulated galaxies, but not all,
develop bipolar outflows. We characterise the strength of the outflow by mass
and energy outflow rates, and investigate the effect of changes to the details
of the model. We find that supernovae are more effective if comprised into
larger superbubbles. The weight and the pressure of the halo gas is able to
quench galactic outflows. The wind emerges from a series of superbubbles in
regions where a critical star formation density is exceeded. The superbubbles
expand into the gaseous halo at slightly supersonic speed, producing radiative
shock waves with similar characteristics as the absorptions systems observed
around LBGs.

why the traditional formulation of Fermat's principle has a limited
application; how the Fermat's principle is formulated for a plane wave; why the
Fermat's principle is consistent with Maxwell EM theory; what the significant
difference is between Poynting theorem and energy conservation law; why
Poynting vector as EM power flow may break energy conservation law and Fermat's
principle in an anisotropic medium; why the physical explanations for

aims to simplify and integrate concepts across artificial intelligence,
mainstream computing and human perception and cognition, with information
compression as a unifying theme. It is conceived as a brain-like system that
receives 'New' information and stores some or all of it in compressed form as
'Old' information. It is realised in the form of a computer model -- a first
version of the SP machine. The concept of ""multiple alignment"" is a powerful
central idea. Using heuristic techniques, the system builds multiple alignments
that are 'good' in terms of information compression. For each multiple
alignment, probabilities may be calculated. These provide the basis for
calculating the probabilities of inferences. The system learns new structures
from partial matches between patterns. Using heuristic techniques, the system
searches for sets of structures that are 'good' in terms of information
compression. These are normally ones that people judge to be 'natural', in
accordance with the 'DONSVIC' principle -- the discovery of natural structures
via information compression. The SP theory may be applied in several areas
including 'computing', aspects of mathematics and logic, representation of
knowledge, natural language processing, pattern recognition, several kinds of
reasoning, information storage and retrieval, planning and problem solving,
information compression, neuroscience, and human perception and cognition.
Examples include the parsing and production of language including discontinuous
dependencies in syntax, pattern recognition at multiple levels of abstraction
and its integration with part-whole relations, nonmonotonic reasoning and
reasoning with default values, reasoning in Bayesian networks including
'explaining away', causal diagnosis, and the solving of a geometric analogy
problem.

in the ""SP machine"" may, with advantage, be applied to the management and
analysis of big data. The SP system -- introduced in the article and fully
described elsewhere -- may help to overcome the problem of variety in big data:
it has potential as ""a universal framework for the representation and
processing of diverse kinds of knowledge"" (UFK), helping to reduce the
diversity of formalisms and formats for knowledge and the different ways in
which they are processed. It has strengths in the unsupervised learning or
discovery of structure in data, in pattern recognition, in the parsing and
production of natural language, in several kinds of reasoning, and more. It
lends itself to the analysis of streaming data, helping to overcome the problem
of velocity in big data. Central in the workings of the system is lossless
compression of information: making big data smaller and reducing problems of
storage and management. There is potential for substantial economies in the
transmission of data, for big cuts in the use of energy in computing, for
faster processing, and for smaller and lighter computers. The system provides a
handle on the problem of veracity in big data, with potential to assist in the
management of errors and uncertainties in data. It lends itself to the
visualisation of knowledge structures and inferential processes. A
high-parallel, open-source version of the SP machine would provide a means for
researchers everywhere to explore what can be done with the system and to
create new versions of it.

'mundane' systematic errors/effects or indicative of new or unappreciated
physics. The main aim of this paper is to argue that recent publications
suggesting that the anomaly is previously overlooked thermal recoil forces,
which is in stark contrast to the earlier consensus (1998-2010), are open to
questioning. Both direct and circumstantial evidence are examined, and the
uncertainty or inaccuracy associated with observations of such a small
magnitude effect is recognised. Whilst a non-systematic based anomaly appears
to be very unlikely, by way of the awkwardness of the observational
characteristics that would need to be modelled, the existence of other
peripheral anomalous phenomena makes an outright dismissal of the anomaly
unwise. Issues from the philosophy of science (and physics) are also tabled. In
the interests of having a contingency plan, should future experiments provide
support for a Pioneer-like anomaly, the type of unappreciated physics that
could conceivably satisfy the awkward observational evidence is alluded to,
albeit in a non-rigorous and cursory manner.

Wolff","J Gerard Wolff","The SP theory of intelligence: benefits and applications","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1212.0229","J G Wolff, Information, 5 (1), 1-27, 2014","10.3390/info5010001",,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This article describes existing and expected benefits of the ""SP theory of
intelligence"", and some potential applications. The theory aims to simplify and
integrate ideas across artificial intelligence, mainstream computing, and human
perception and cognition, with information compression as a unifying theme. It
combines conceptual simplicity with descriptive and explanatory power across
several areas of computing and cognition. In the ""SP machine"" -- an expression
of the SP theory which is currently realized in the form of a computer model --
there is potential for an overall simplification of computing systems,
including software. The SP theory promises deeper insights and better solutions
in several areas of application including, most notably, unsupervised learning,
natural language processing, autonomous robots, computer vision, intelligent
databases, software engineering, information compression, medical diagnosis and
big data. There is also potential in areas such as the semantic web,
bioinformatics, structuring of documents, the detection of computer viruses,
data fusion, new kinds of computer, and the development of scientific theories.
The theory promises seamless integration of structures and functions within and
between different areas of application. The potential value, worldwide, of
these benefits and applications is at least $190 billion each year. Further
development would be facilitated by the creation of a high-parallel,
open-source version of the SP machine, available to researchers everywhere.

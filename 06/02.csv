self-propel in viscous fluids. However, the criteria governing the selection of

far. To address this question, we derive computationally the optimal shape of
an internally-forced periodic planar flagellum deforming as a travelling wave.
The optimum is here defined as the shape leading to a given swimming speed with
minimum energetic cost. To calculate the energetic cost though, we consider the
irreversible internal power expanded by the molecular motors forcing the

optimisation approach allows us to derive a family of shapes depending on a
single dimensionless number quantifying the relative importance of elastic to
viscous effects: the Sperm number. The computed optimal shapes are found to
agree with the waveforms observed on spermatozoon of marine organisms, thus
suggesting that these eukaryotic flagella might have evolved to be mechanically
optimal.

  reduced-order models",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Over the last few years there have been dramatic advances in our
understanding of mathematical and computational models of complex systems in
the presence of uncertainty. This has led to a growth in the area of
uncertainty quantification as well as the need to develop efficient, scalable,
stable and convergent computational methods for solving differential equations
with random inputs. Stochastic Galerkin methods based on polynomial chaos
expansions have shown superiority to other non-sampling and many sampling
techniques. However, for complicated governing equations numerical
implementations of stochastic Galerkin methods can become non-trivial. On the
other hand, Monte Carlo and other traditional sampling methods, are
straightforward to implement. However, they do not offer as fast convergence
rates as stochastic Galerkin. Other numerical approaches are the stochastic
collocation (SC) methods, which inherit both, the ease of implementation of
Monte Carlo and the robustness of stochastic Galerkin to a great deal. However,
stochastic collocation and its powerful extensions, e.g. sparse grid stochastic
collocation, can simply fail to handle more levels of complication. The
seemingly innocent Burgers equation driven by Brownian motion is such an
example. In this work we propose a novel enhancement to stochastic collocation
methods using locally improved deterministic model reduction techniques that
can handle this pathological example and hopefully other more complicated
equations like Stochastic Navier-Stokes. Local improvements to reduced-order
models are achieved using sensitivity analysis of the proper orthogonal
decomposition. Our numerical results show that the proposed technique is not
only reliable and robust but also very efficient.

diffusion-based molecular communications with drift inside blood vessels. The
contribution of the paper is twofold. First a detailed description of the
simulator is given, under the software engineering point of view, by
highlighting the innovations and optimizations introduced. Their introduction
into the previous version of the BiNS simulator was needed to provide to
functions for simulating molecular signaling and communication potentials
inside bounded spaces. The second contribution consists of the analysis,
carried out by using BiNS2, of a specific communication process happening
inside blood vessels, the atherogenesis, which is the initial phase of the
formation of atherosclerotic plaques, due to the abnormal signaling between
platelets and endothelium. From a communication point of view, platelets act as
mobile transmitters, endothelial cells are fixed receivers, sticky to the
vessel walls, and the transmitted signal is made of bursts of molecules emitted
by platelets. The simulator allows evaluating the channel latency and the
footprint on the vessel wall of the transmitted signal as a function of the
transmitter distance from the vessels wall, the signal strength, and the
receiver sensitivity.

adequately in supervised deep networks because their values are refined during

showed that learning the connections based on the co-occurrences of the

$X$ admits a bounded coupling with its size biased version, we prove simple and
strong concentration bounds. In particular the upper tail probability is shown
to decay at least as fast as the reciprocal of a Gamma function, guaranteeing a
moment generating function that converges everywhere. The class of infinitely
divisible distributions with finite mean, whose L\'evy measure is supported on
an interval contained in $[0,c]$ for some $c < \infty$, forms a special case in
which this upper bound is logarithmically sharp. In particular the asymptotic
estimate for the Dickman function, that $\rho(u) \approx u^{-u}$ for large $u$,
is shown to be universal for this class.
  A special case of our bounds arises when $X$ is a sum of independent random
variables, each admitting a 1-bounded size bias coupling. In this case, our
bounds are comparable to Chernoff--Hoeffding bounds; however, ours are broader
in scope, sharper for the upper tail, and equal for the lower tail.
  We discuss \emph{bounded} and \emph{monotone} couplings, give a sandwich
principle, and show how this gives an easy conceptual proof that any finite

Recent studies suggest that the
answer depends on the type of contagion. Complex contagions, unlike infectious
diseases (simple contagions), are affected by social reinforcement and
homophily. Hence, the spread within highly clustered communities is enhanced,
while diffusion across communities is hampered. A common hypothesis is that
memes and behaviors are complex contagions. We show that, while most memes
indeed behave like complex contagions, a few viral memes spread across many
communities, like diseases. We demonstrate that the future popularity of a meme
can be predicted by quantifying its early spreading pattern in terms of
community concentration. The more communities a meme permeates, the more viral
it is. We present a practical method to translate data about community
structure into predictive knowledge about what information will spread widely.
This connection may lead to significant advances in computational social
science, social media analytics, and marketing applications.

sign (or phase, for complex numbers) information. More than four decades after
it was first proposed, the seminal error reduction algorithm of (Gerchberg and
Saxton 1972) and (Fienup 1982) is still the popular choice for solving many
variants of this problem. The algorithm is based on alternating minimization;
i.e. it alternates between estimating the missing phase information, and the
candidate solution. Despite its wide usage in practice, no global convergence
guarantees for this algorithm are known. In this paper, we show that a
(resampling) variant of this approach converges geometrically to the solution
of one such problem -- finding a vector $\mathbf{x}$ from
$\mathbf{y},\mathbf{A}$, where $\mathbf{y} =
\left|\mathbf{A}^{\top}\mathbf{x}\right|$ and $|\mathbf{z}|$ denotes a vector
of element-wise magnitudes of $\mathbf{z}$ -- under the assumption that
$\mathbf{A}$ is Gaussian.
  Empirically, we demonstrate that alternating minimization performs similar to
recently proposed convex techniques for this problem (which are based on
""lifting"" to a convex matrix problem) in sample complexity and robustness to
noise. However, it is much more efficient and can scale to large problems.
Analytically, for a resampling version of alternating minimization, we show
geometric convergence to the solution, and sample complexity that is off by log
factors from obvious lower bounds. We also establish close to optimal scaling
for the case when the unknown vector is sparse. Our work represents the first
theoretical guarantee for alternating minimization (albeit with resampling) for
any variant of phase retrieval problems in the non-convex setting.

an external rotation symmetry. The latter corresponds to the rotational
isometry of the BTZ solution, and does not decouple from SU(N) gauge
transformations. The system contains an invariant which is quadratic in the

in generating entangled states for use in quantum metrology and quantum
information. In particular, ultracold atomic gases, trapped ion systems, and
Rydberg atoms realize long-ranged Ising models, which even in the absence of a
transverse field can give rise to highly non-classical dynamics and long-range
quantum correlations. In the first part of this paper, we present a detailed
theoretical framework for studying the dynamics of such systems driven (at time
t=0) into arbitrary unentangled non-equilibrium states, thus greatly extending
and unifying the work of Ref. [1]. Specifically, we derive exact expressions
for closed-time-path ordered correlation functions, and use these to study
experimentally relevant observables, e.g. Bloch vector and spin-squeezing
dynamics. In the second part, these correlation functions are then used to
derive closed-form expressions for the dynamics of arbitrary spin-spin
correlation functions in the presence of both T_1 (spontaneous spin
relaxation/excitation) and T_2 (dephasing) type decoherence processes. Even
though the decoherence is local, our solution reveals that the competition
between Ising dynamics and T_1 decoherence gives rise to an emergent non-local
dephasing effect, thereby drastically amplifying the degradation of quantum
correlations. In addition to identifying the mechanism of this deleterious
effect, our solution points toward a scheme to eliminate it via
measurement-based coherent feedback.

Voigt function due to the fact that the scattering cross section near resonant
line center is approximately described by the Lorentzian function. Since a
hydrogen atom has infinitely many $p$ states that participate in the electric
dipole interaction, the cross section starts to deviate from the Lorentzian in
an asymmetric way in the line wing regions. We investigate this asymmetry in
the absorption line profiles around Ly\alpha\ and Ly\beta\ as a function of the
neutral hydrogen column density $N_{HI}$. In terms of
$\Delta\lambda\equiv\lambda-\lambda_\alpha$ we expand the Kramers-Heisenberg

(\Delta\lambda/\lambda_\alpha)]$, where $f_{12}$ and $\sigma_T$ are the
oscillator strength of Ly$\alpha$ and the Thomson scattering cross section,
respectively. In terms of $\Delta\lambda_2\equiv\lambda-\lambda_\beta$ in the
vicinity of Ly\beta, the total scattering cross section, given as the sum of
cross sections for Rayleigh and Raman scattering, is shown to be
$\sigma(\lambda)\simeq \sigma_T(0.5f_{13})^2(1+R_0)

uses convex analysis to simulate efficiently from high-dimensional densities

in modern high-dimensional statistics and data analysis. The method is based on
a new first-order approximation for Langevin diffusions that exploits
log-concavity to construct Markov chains with favourable convergence
properties. This approximation is closely related to Moreau-Yoshida
regularisations for convex functions and uses proximity mappings instead of
gradient mappings to approximate the continuous-time process. The proposed
method complements existing MALA methods in two ways. First, the method is
shown to have very robust stability properties and to converge geometrically
for many target densities for which other MALA are not geometric, or only if
the step size is sufficiently small. Second, the method can be applied to
high-dimensional target densities that are not continuously differentiable, a
class of distributions that is increasingly used in image processing and
machine learning and that is beyond the scope of existing MALA and HMC
algorithms. To use this method it is necessary to compute or to approximate
efficiently the proximity mappings of the logarithm of the target density. For
several popular models, including many Bayesian models used in modern signal
and image processing and machine learning, this can be achieved with convex
optimisation algorithms and with approximations based on proximal splitting
techniques, which can be implemented in parallel. The proposed method is
demonstrated on two challenging high-dimensional and non-differentiable models

transverse plane waves is considered for a Mooney-Rivlin material maintained in
a state of finite static homogeneous deformation. It is shown that such waves
are possible provided that the directions of the normal to the planes of
constant phase and of the normal to the planes of constant amplitude are
orthogonal and conjugate with respect to the B-ellipsoid, where B is the left
Cauchy-Green strain tensor corresponding to the initial deformation. For these

flux are nevertheless identical with corresponding results in the classical
linearized elasticity theory. Byproducts of the results are new exact static

includes a suggestion component which provides a cluster of suggested friends

Google advise their users not to share their passwords with anyone, to avoid
security and privacy breaches. To understand users' general password sharing
behavior and practices, we conducted an online survey with 209 Indian
participants and found that 64.35% of the participants felt a need to share
their email passwords. Further, about 77% of the participants said that they
would want to use a system which could provide them access control features, to
maintain their privacy while sharing emails. To address the privacy concerns of
users who need to share emails, we propose ChaMAILeon, a system which enables
users to share their email passwords while maintaining their privacy.
ChaMAILeon allows users to create multiple passwords for their email account.
Each such password corresponds to a different set of access control rules, and
gives a different view of the same email account. We conducted a controlled
experiment with 30 participants to evaluate the usability of the system. Each
participant was required to perform 5 tasks. Each task corresponded to
different access control rules, which the participant was required to set, for
a dummy email account. We found that, with a reasonable number of multiple

The system usability score was found out to be 75.42. Moreover, 56.6% of the

nodes are the involved users and links are the following relationships among

possibility of forwarding it. However, additional exposures cannot further
improve the chance of forwarding when the number of exposures crosses its peak
at two. This finding questions the cumulative effect hypothesis in information
diffusion. Furthermore, to clarify the forwarding preference among users, we
investigate both the structural motif of the diffusion network and the temporal
pattern of information diffusion process among users. The patterns provide
vital insight for understanding the variation of message popularity and explain
the characteristics of diffusion networks.

which porcine brain tissue is stored or preserved prior to testing has a
significant effect on the mechanical properties of brain tissue, even when
tests are conducted at the same temperatures. Three groups of brain tissue were
stored separately for at least one hour at three different preservation
temperatures, i.e., ice cold, room temperature (22C) and body temperature
(37C), prior to them all being tested at room temperature (approx. 22C).
Significant differences in the corresponding initial elastic shear modulus mu
(Pa) (at various amounts of shear, K, i.e., 0-0.2) were observed. The initial
elastic moduli were 1043 +/- 271 Pa, 714 +/- 210 Pa and 497 +/- 156 Pa (mean
+/- SD) at preservation temperatures of ice cold, 22C and 37C, respectively.
Based on this investigation, it is strongly recommended that brain tissue
samples must be preserved at an ice-cold temperature prior to testing in order
to minimize the difference between the measured in vitro test results and the
in vivo properties. A by-product of the study is that simple shear tests allow
for large, almost perfectly homogeneous deformation of brain matter.

recently seen by IceCube can allow to single the neutrino origin out. The
detection of tau neutrinos would be a clear way to prove that they come from
cosmic distances, but at the highest energies currently seen, about 1 PeV, an
experimental characterization of tau events is difficult. The study of the
fraction of the muon tracks seems more promising. In fact, for any initial
composition, because of the occurrence of flavor oscillations and despite their
uncertainties, the fraction of muon tracks in the cosmic neutrinos is smaller
than the one of atmospheric neutrinos, even hypothesizing an arbitrarily large
contribution from charmed mesons. A good understanding of the detection
efficiencies and the optimization of the analysis cuts, along with a reasonable
increase in the statistics, should provide us with a significant test of the
cosmic origin of these events.

there is an over-representation of high-degree off-shore financial centres
among the countries most-related to this observation, suggesting an

attempt to map Quality of Service (QoS) to Quality of Experience (QoE) for

that data can be transported with a minimum of packet loss, delay and maximum
bandwidth. QoE is a subjective measure that involves human dimensions; it ties
together user perception, expectations, and experience of the application and
network performance. The Holy Grail of subjective measurement is to predict it
from the objective measurements; in other words predict QoE from a given set of
QoS parameters or vice versa. Whilst there are many quality models for
multimedia, most of them are only partial solutions to predicting QoE from a
given QoS. This contribution analyses a number of previous attempts and
optimisation techniquesthat can reliably compute the weighting coefficients for
the QoS/QoE mapping.

understanding of mathematical and computational models of complex systems in
the presence of uncertainty. This has led to a growth in the area of
uncertainty quantification as well as the need to develop efficient, scalable,
stable and convergent computational methods for solving differential equations
with random inputs. Stochastic Galerkin methods based on polynomial chaos
expansions have shown superiority to other non-sampling and many sampling
techniques. However, for complicated governing equations numerical
implementations of stochastic Galerkin methods can become non-trivial. On the
other hand, Monte Carlo and other traditional sampling methods, are
straightforward to implement. However, they do not offer as fast convergence
rates as stochastic Galerkin. Other numerical approaches are the stochastic
collocation (SC) methods, which inherit both, the ease of implementation of
Monte Carlo and the robustness of stochastic Galerkin to a great deal. In this
work we propose a novel enhancement to stochastic collocation methods using
deterministic model reduction techniques. Linear parabolic partial differential
equations with random forcing terms are analysed. The input data are assumed to
be represented by a finite number of random variables. A rigorous convergence
analysis, supported by numerical results, shows that the proposed technique is
not only reliable and robust but also efficient.

paradigm of one-way vehicle sharing for sustainable personal urban mobility in
densely populated cities. In this paper, we enhance the capability of a MoD
system by deploying robotic shared vehicles that can autonomously cruise the
streets to be hailed by users. A key challenge to managing the MoD system
effectively is that of real-time, fine-grained mobility demand sensing and
prediction. This paper presents a novel decentralized data fusion and active
sensing algorithm for real-time, fine-grained mobility demand sensing and
prediction with a fleet of autonomous robotic vehicles in a MoD system. Our
Gaussian process (GP)-based decentralized data fusion algorithm can achieve a
fine balance between predictive power and time efficiency. We theoretically
guarantee its predictive performance to be equivalent to that of a
sophisticated centralized sparse approximation for the GP model: The
computation of such a sparse approximate GP model can thus be distributed among
the MoD vehicles, hence achieving efficient and scalable demand prediction.
Though our decentralized active sensing strategy is devised to gather the most
informative demand data for demand prediction, it can achieve a dual effect of
fleet rebalancing to service the mobility demands. Empirical evaluation on
real-world mobility demand data shows that our proposed algorithm can achieve a
better balance between predictive accuracy and time efficiency than
state-of-the-art algorithms.

of polymer solar cells (PSCs). Four types of negative electrodes with equal
area (0.09 cm2) but different shape (round, oval, square, and triangular) are
evaluated with respect to short-circuit current density, open-circuit voltage,
fill factor, and power conversion efficiency of PSCs. The results show that the
device with round electrodes gives the best photovoltaic performance; in
contrast, the device with triangular electrodes reveals the worst properties.
Maximum almost twice increase in PCE with round electrode is obtained in the
devices compared with that of the triangular electrode. As a conclusion, the
electrode boundary curvature has a strong influence on the performance of PSCs.
The larger curvature, i.e. the sharper electrodes edge, maybe is a negative
effector on exciton separation and carrier transport in PSC system.

surrounding supernova remnant W\,50 depositing in its expansion possibly more
than 99% of their kinetic energy (\cite[1998]{Dub98}). Where and how this
transformation of energy is curried out, it is not yet known. What can we learn
from it that the jets decelerate and the deceleration is non-dissipative, i.e.
radiatively dark. In this paper we unclose the observed deviations of the
precessing radio jets of SS\,433, within a few arcseconds from a jets source,
from the ballistic track, described by the kinematic model, as a signature of
the deceleration which, on other hand, issues from the jets colliding with
ambient medium. For that we model kinematics of these colliding jets. The ram
pressure on the jets is estimated from the observed profile of brightness of
synchrotron radiation along the radio jets. We have found that to fit observed
locus the radio jets should be decelerated and twisted, additionally to the
precession twist, mostly within the first one-fifth of precession period, and
further they extend imitating ballistic jets. The fitted physical parameters of
the jet model turned out to be physically reliable and characteristic for
SS\,433 jets that unlikely to be occasional. This model explains naturally, and
meets approval by a) the observed shock-pressed morphology of the radio jets
and their brightness, b) the observed $\sim 10%$ deflections from the standard
kinematic model --- just a magnitude of the jet speed decrement in the model,
c) regularly observed for the radio jets the precession phase deviation from
the standard kinematic model prediction, d) dichotomy of distance to the

transition at ~ 0.58 are inherently non-equilibrium systems, where the dynamics
slows down with a structural relaxation time diverging with density; hence, the
random close packing is inaccessible. Here we perform simulations of
self-propelled hard spheres, and we find that with increasing activity the
relaxation dynamics can be sped up by orders of magnitude. The glass transition
shifts to higher packing fractions upon increasing the activity, allowing the
study of sphere packings with fluid-like dynamics at packing fractions close to

energetic particles (SEPs) arose 50 years ago with radio observations of type
III bursts, produced by outward streaming electrons, and type II bursts from
coronal and interplanetary shock waves. Since that time we have found that the
former are related to ""impulsive"" SEP events from impulsive flares or jets.
Here, resonant stochastic acceleration, related to magnetic reconnection
involving open field lines, produces not only electrons but 1000-fold
enhancements of 3He/4He and of (Z>50)/O. Alternatively, in ""gradual"" SEP
events, shock waves, driven out from the Sun by coronal mass ejections (CMEs),
more democratically sample ion abundances that are even used to measure the
coronal abundances of the elements. Sometimes residual impulsive suprathermal
ions contribute to the seed population for shock acceleration, complicating the
abundance picture, but this process has now been modeled theoretically.
Initially, impulsive events define a point source on the Sun, selectively
filling few magnetic flux tubes, while gradual events show broad acceleration
that can fill half of the inner heliosphere, beginning when the shock reaches
~2 solar radii. Shock acceleration occurs as ions are scattered back and forth
across the shock by resonant Alfven waves amplified by the accelerated protons
themselves. These waves also can produce a streaming-limited maximum SEP
intensity and plateau region upstream of the shock. Behind the shock lies the
large expanse of the ""reservoir"", a spatially extensive trapped volume of
uniform SEP intensities with invariant energy-spectral shapes where overall
intensities decrease with time as the enclosing ""magnetic bottle"" expands
adiabatically. These reservoirs now explain the slow intensity decrease that
defines gradual events, once erroneously attributed solely to slow outward
diffusion.

metal-poor (CEMP) star BD+44 493, previously reported on by Ito et al. Our
measurements confirm that BD+44 493 is an extremely metal-poor ([Fe/H]=-3.8)
subgiant star with excesses of carbon and oxygen. No significant excesses are
found for nitrogen and neutron-capture elements (the latter of which place it
in the CEMP-no class of stars). Other elements that we measure exhibit
abundance patterns that are typical for non-CEMP extremely metal-poor stars. No
evidence for variations of radial velocity have been found for this star. These
results strongly suggest that the carbon enhancement in BD+44 493 is unlikely
to have been produced by a companion asymptotic giant-branch star and
transferred to the presently observed star, nor by pollution of its natal
molecular cloud by rapidly-rotating, massive, mega metal-poor ([Fe/H] < -6.0)
stars. A more likely possibility is that this star formed from gas polluted by
the elements produced in a ""faint"" supernova, which underwent mixing and
fallback, and only ejected small amounts of elements of metals beyond the
lighter elements. The Li abundance of BD+44 493 (A(Li)=log(Li/H)+12=1.0) is
lower than the Spite plateau value, as found in other metal-poor subgiants. The
upper limit on Be abundance (A(Be)=log(Be/H)+12<-1.8) is as low as those found
for stars with similarly extremely-low metallicity, indicating that the

Mesa Reservoir contains recreationally important populations of lake trout
(Salvelinus namaycush), kokanee salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), rainbow trout
(Onocorhynchus mykiss), and brown trout (Salmo trutta). A management challenge
in recent years has been the overpopulation of lake trout, which has led to a
steep decline in abundance of kokanee salmon (a preferred food source) followed
by a steep decline in body condition of the lake trout. Relative weight, Wr, is
commonly used to assess body condition and prey availability of fish in a
variety of ecosystems, but its seasonal variability has not been well
documented in cold water species. Relative weight is 100 times the actual
weight of a fish divided by expected weight (or standard weight) of that
species at the measured total length. The present study uses multi-year,
multi-season length and weight data provided by the Colorado Department of
Parks and Wildlife to quantify seasonal variations in mean relative weight in
these four species. It is found that lake trout consistently lose significant
body condition between the spring and the fall of a given year, with a mean
loss in relative weight of 11.7 +/- 2.4. In contrast, kokanee salmon tend to
gain significant body condition between spring and fall with a mean gain in
relative weight of 5.2 +/- 2.9. Rainbow trout tend to lose body condition
between summer and fall with a mean loss of relative weight of 7.4 +/- 1.7.
Brown trout tend to gain body condition between spring and fall with a mean
gain of 5.6 +/- 1.8. These findings can be interpreted in terms of the feeding
habits, forage availability, and metabolic activity of each species.

enabled inferences of its interior structure and dynamics. In interpreting
these measurements, the simplifying assumption that waves propagate through a
temporally stationary medium is almost universally invoked. However, the Sun is
in a constant state of evolution, on a broad range of spatio-temporal scales.
At the zero wavelength limit, i.e., when the wavelength is much shorter than
the scale over which the medium varies, the WKBJ (ray) approximation may be
applied. Here, we address the other asymptotic end of the spectrum, the
infinite wavelength limit, using the technique of homogenization. We apply
homogenization to scenarios where waves are propagating through rapidly varying
media (spatially and temporally), and derive effective models for the media.
One consequence is that a scalar sound speed becomes a tensorial wavespeed in
the effective model and anisotropies can be induced depending on the nature of
the perturbation. The second term in this asymptotic two-scale expansion, the
so-called corrector, contains contributions due to higher-order scattering,
leading to the decoherence of the wavefield. This decoherence may be causally
linked to the observed wave attenuation in the Sun. Although the examples we
consider here consist of periodic arrays of perturbations to the background,
homogenization may be extended to ergodic and stationary random media. This
method may have broad implications for the manner in which we interpret seismic
measurements in the Sun and for modeling the effects of granulation on the
scattering of waves and distortion of normal-mode eigenfunctions.

processes in disordered media. They were introduced at the end of the 70's by
Kesten-Spitzer and Borodin, motivated by the construction of new self-similar
processes with stationary increments. Two sources of randomness enter in their
definition: a random field $\xi = (\xi_x)_{x \in \Z^d}$ of i.i.d.\ random
variables, which is called the \emph{random scenery}, and a random walk $S =
(S_n)_{n \in \N}$ evolving in $\Z^d$, independent from the scenery. The RWRS $Z
= (Z_n)_{n \in \N}$ is then defined as the accumulated scenery along the
trajectory of the random walk, i.e., $Z_n := \sum_{k=1}^n \xi_{S_k}$. The law
of $Z$ under the joint law of $\xi$ and $S$ is called ""annealed"", and the
conditional law given $\xi$ is called ""quenched"". Recently, central limit
theorems under the quenched law were proved for $Z$ by the first two authors
for a class of transient random walks including walks with finite variance in
dimension $d \ge 3$. In this paper we extend their results to dimension $d=2$.

scale-dependent Betti numbers, which formalize the topological information
content of the cosmic mass distribution. While the Betti numbers do not fully
quantify topology, they extend the information beyond conventional cosmological
studies of topology in terms of genus and Euler characteristic. The richer
information content of Betti numbers goes along the availability of fast
algorithms to compute them.
  For continuous density fields, we determine the scale-dependence of Betti
numbers by invoking the cosmologically familiar filtration of sublevel or
superlevel sets defined by density thresholds. For the discrete galaxy
distribution, however, the analysis is based on the alpha shapes of the
particles. These simplicial complexes constitute an ordered sequence of nested
subsets of the Delaunay tessellation, a filtration defined by the scale
parameter, $\alpha$. As they are homotopy equivalent to the sublevel sets of
the distance field, they are an excellent tool for assessing the topological
structure of a discrete point distribution. In order to develop an intuitive
understanding for the behavior of Betti numbers as a function of $\alpha$, and
their relation to the morphological patterns in the Cosmic Web, we first study
them within the context of simple heuristic Voronoi clustering models.
  Subsequently, we address the topology of structures emerging in the standard
LCDM scenario and in cosmological scenarios with alternative dark energy
content. The evolution and scale-dependence of the Betti numbers is shown to
reflect the hierarchical evolution of the Cosmic Web and yields a promising
measure of cosmological parameters. We also discuss the expected Betti numbers
as a function of the density threshold for superlevel sets of a Gaussian random
field.

$d$ on the unit ball $B^n \subset {\mathbb R}^n$ can be bounded through the
maximum of its absolute value on any subset $Z\subset Q^n_1$ of positive
$n$-measure $m_n(Z)$. In \cite{Yom} a stronger version of Remez inequality was
obtained: the Lebesgue $n$-measure $m_n$ was replaced by a certain geometric
quantity $\omega_{n,d}(Z)$ satisfying $\omega_{n,d}(Z)\geq m_n(Z)$ for any
measurable $Z$. The quantity $\omega_{n,d}(Z)$ can be effectively estimated in
terms of the metric entropy of $Z$ and it may be nonzero for discrete and even
finite sets $Z$.
  In the present paper we extend Remez inequality to functions of finite
smoothness. This is done by combining the result of \cite{Yom} with the Taylor
polynomial approximation of smooth functions. As a consequence we obtain
explicit lower bounds in some examples in the Whitney problem of a $C^k$-smooth
extrapolation from a given set $Z$, in terms of the geometry of $Z$.

that the Fe layer at the Fe/FePt interface plays a crucial role inasmuch its
(isotropic) exchange coupling to the soft (Fe) phase of the system is
substantially reduced. Moreover, this interfacial Fe layer has a substantial
impact on the MAE of the system. We show that the MAE of the FePt slab,
including the contribution from the Fe/FePt interface, is dominated by
anisotropic inter-site exchange interactions. Our calculations indicate that
the change in the MAE of the FePt slab with respect to the corresponding bulk
value is negative, i.e., the presence of Fe/FePt interfaces appears to reduce
the perpendicular MAE of the Fe/FePt/Fe system. However, for the relaxed
system, this reduction is marginal. It is also shown that the relaxed system
exhibits a reduced interfacial exchange. Using a simple linear chain model we
demonstrate that the reduced exchange leads to a discontinuity in the

interest that arises whenever tasks need to be performed by authorized users,
subject to constraints defined by business rules. We are required to decide
whether there exists a \emph{plan} -- an assignment of tasks to authorized
users -- such that all constraints are satisfied. Several bespoke algorithms
have been constructed for solving the WSP, optimised to deal with constraints
(business rules) of particular types.
  It is natural to see the WSP as a subclass of the {\em Constraint
Satisfaction Problem (CSP)} in which the variables are tasks and the domain is
the set of users. What makes the WSP distinctive as a CSP is that we can assume
that the number of tasks is very small compared to the number of users. This is
in sharp contrast with traditional CSP models where the domain is small and the
number of variables is very large. As such, it is appropriate to ask for which
constraint languages the WSP is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT), parameterized
by the number of tasks. We have identified a new FPT constraint language,
user-independent constraint, that includes many of the constraints of interest
in business processing systems. We are also able to prove that the union of FPT
languages remains FPT if they satisfy a simple compatibility condition.
  In this paper we present our generic algorithm, in which plans are grouped
into equivalence classes, each class being associated with a \emph{pattern}. We
demonstrate that our generic algorithm has running time $O^*(2^{k\log k})$,
where $k$ is the number of tasks, for the language of user-independent
constraints. We also show that there is no algorithm of running time
$O^*(2^{o(k\log k)})$ for user-independent constraints unless the Exponential
Time Hypothesis fails.

induced by a non-uniform insulating barrier and the Fiske resonance appears
without external magnetic field. This is called zero-field Fiske resonance
(ZFFR). In this paper, we theoretically study the ZFFR coupled with spin-waves
in a superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator/superconductor junction
(ferromagnetic Josephson junction) with a non-uniform ferromagnetic insulating
barrier. The resonant mode coupled with spin-waves can be induced without
external magnetic field. We find that the $I$-$V$ curve shows resonant peaks
associated with composite excitations of spin-waves and the EM field in the
junction. The voltage at the resonance is obtained as a function of the normal
modes of EM field. The ZFFRs coupled with spin-waves are found as peak
structures in the DC Josephson current density as a function of bias voltage.

Plasma (QGP) dilepton spectra in the Intermediate Mass Region (IMR) of
heavy-ion collisions, as a new method to search for GeV-scale dark gauge bosons
(gamma' or Z'). Such light mediators are a common feature of light (i.e. low
mass) dark matter scenarios, which have been invoked to explain puzzling
signals in dark matter indirect and direct detection experiments. First we show
that a light gamma' or Z' will generate a resonant enhancement of the dilepton
spectrum produced thermally by the QGP, at an energy corresponding to the dark
gauge boson mass. Secondly, using data from the PHENIX experiment, we are able
to set an upper limit on the combined coupling of this new gauge boson to
quarks and leptons (independently of their vectorial or axial nature) chi_q
chi_e < 10^(-3) at the 95% confidence level for a gauge boson mass in the range
1.5 - 2.5 GeV. This result complements previous searches for new light gauge
bosons and probes a new region of the parameter space, particularly interesting
in the case of non-universal couplings to quarks and leptons. Prospects for the
discovery of such a boson by the ALICE collaboration are also discussed.

challenge. Millions of individual decisions, motivated by economic, political,
demographic, rational, and/or emotional reasons underlie the high complexity of
demographic dynamics. Significant advances in quantitatively understanding such
complexity have been registered in recent years, as those involving the growth
of cities [Bettencourt LMA, Lobo J, Helbing D, Kuehnert C, West GB (2007)
Growth,. Innovation, Scaling, and the Pace of Life in Cities, Proc Natl Acad
Sci USA 104 (17) 7301-7306] but many fundamental issues still defy
comprehension. We present here compelling empirical evidence of a high level of
regularity regarding time and spatial correlations in urban sprawl, unraveling
patterns about the inertia in the growth of cities and their interaction with
each other. By using one of the world's most exhaustive extant demographic data
basis ---that of the Spanish Government's Institute INE, with records covering
111 years and (in 2011) 45 million people, distributed amongst more than 8000
population nuclei--- we show that the inertia of city growth has a
characteristic time of 15 years, and its interaction with the growth of other
cities has a characteristic distance of 70 km. Distance is shown to be the main
factor that entangles two cities (a 60% of total correlations). We present a
mathematical model for population flows that i) reproduces all these
regularities and ii) can be used to predict the population-evolution of cities.
The power of our current social theories is thereby enhanced.

single-electron transistor(SET) has a profound influence on the Kondo effect,
as shown in a recent experiment[B. Hemingway, S. Herbert, M. Melloch and A.
Kogan, arXiv:1304.0037(2013)]. For a given microwave frequency, the Kondo
differential conductance shows a non-monotonic magnetic field dependence, and a
very sharp peak is observed for certain field applied. Additionally, the
microwave frequency is found to be larger of about one order than the
corresponding Zeeman energy. These two features are not understood in the
current theory. Here we propose a phenomenological mechanism to explain these
observations. When both magnetic field and microwave are applied in the SET, if
the frequency matches the (renormalized) Zeeman energy, it is assumed that the
microwave is able to induce spin-flip in the SET, which leads to two
consequences. One is the dot level shifts down and the other is the
renormalization of the Zeeman energy. This picture can not only explain
qualitatively the main findings in the experiment but also further stimulate
the related experimental study of the dynamic response of the Kondo effect in
out-of-equilibrium devices.

technology because it can conceal both the client's data and the algorithm
itself from the server. However, problems need to be solved in the practical
use of blind quantum computation and fault-tolerance is a major challenge. On
an example circuit, the computational cost measured in T gates executed by the
client is 97 times more than performing the original computation directly,
without using the server, even before applying error correction. (The client
still benefits due to drastically reduced memory requirements.) Broadbent et
al. proposed running error correction over blind computation, but our first
protocol applies one layer of Steane's [[7,1,3]] code underneath instead. This
protocol has better fault tolerance, but still results in a substantial
overhead. We propose another protocol to reduce the client's computational load
by transferring the qubit preparation to the server. For each logical qubit
used in the computation, the client is only required to receive eight logical
qubits via teleportation then buffer two logical qubits before returning one.
This protocol also protects the client's fault-tolerant preparation of logical
qubits from a side-channel attack.

be used to extend the colour range of the red giants in the clusters which are

silicon carbide grains of type C are a special sub-group of SiC grains from

type X grains. In this scenario, extreme $^{32}$S enrichments observed in C
grains may be explained by the presence of short-lived $^{32}$Si
($\tau$$_{1/2}$ = 153 years) in the ejecta, produced by neutron capture
processes starting from the stable Si isotopes. No mixing from deeper Si-rich
material and/or fractionation of Si from S due to molecular chemistry is needed
to explain the $^{32}$S enrichments. The abundance of $^{32}$Si in the grains
can provide constraints on the neutron density reached during the supernova
explosion in the C-rich He shell material. The impact of the large uncertainty
of the neutron capture cross sections in the $^{32}$Si region is discussed.

surface gradient operator is originated from the differentiability of a tensor
field defined on the surface. Some integral and differential identities have
been theoretically studied that play the important role in the studies on
continuous mediums whose geometrical configurations can be taken as surfaces
and on interactions between fluids and deformable boundaries. The definition of
Levi-Civita gradient is based on Levi-Civita connections generally defined on
Riemann manifolds. It can be used to set up some differential identities in the
intrinsic/coordiantes-independent form that play the essential role in the
theory of vorticity dynamics for two dimensional flows on general fixed smooth

corresponding phase space, or by a cell in its 2-D subspace. Its area is
frequently stated to be no less than one half of the Plank constant, implying
that such a cell is an indivisible quantum of the 2-D phase space. But this is
generally not true, as is evident, for instance, from representation of some
states in the basis of innately discrete observables like angular momentum.
Here we consider some dispersed states involving the evanescent waves (EW)
different from that in the total internal reflection. Such states are
represented by a set of separated point-like cells, but with a large total
indeterminacy. An idealized model has a discrete Wigner function forming an
infinite periodic array of dots on the phase plane. The question about the
total momentum indeterminacy in such state is discussed. We argue that the
transverse momentum eigenstates corresponding to the considered EW-s cannot be
singled out by any known measurement procedure, and the whole infinite set of
the corresponding eigenvalues can contribute only a certain fraction to the
observed momentum indeterminacy which remains finite.

and the master equation \cite {Schlosshauer,BieleA}) but entrenched in the
traditional density matrix formalism, is developed in a semi-classical setting,
so as to go from the solutions of the time dependent \SE to decohering and
thermalized states. This is achieved by utilizing the time-ergodicity, rather
than the sampling- (or ensemble-) ergodicity, of physical systems.
  We introduce the formalism through a study of the Rabi model (a two level
system coupled to an oscillator) and show that our semi-classical version
exhibits, both qualitatively and quantitatively, many features of state
truncation and equilibration \cite {AllahverdyanBN}. We then study the time
evolution of two qubits in interaction with a bosonic environment, such that
the energy scale of one qubit is much larger, and that of the other much
smaller than the environment's energy scale. The small energy qubit decoheres
to a mixture, while the high energy qubit is protected through the adiabatic
theorem. However, an inter-qubit coupling generates an overall decoherence and
leads for some values of the coupling to long term revivals in the state
occupations.

representation in Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) with a nondegenerate vacuum
metric, we construct a polymer quantization of the parametrised massless scalar
field theory on a Minkowskian cylinder. The dif- feomorphism covariant
kinematics is based on states which carry a continuous label corresponding to
smooth embedding geometries, in addition to the discrete embedding and matter
labels. The physical state space, obtained through group averaging procedure,
is nonseparable. A physical state in this theory can be interpreted as a
quantum spacetime, which is composed of discrete strips and supercedes the
classical continuum. We find that the conformal group is broken in the quantum
theory, and consists of all Poincare translations. These features are
remarkably different compared to the case without a smooth embedding. Finally,
we analyse the length operator whose spectrum is shown to be a sum of
contributions from the continuous and discrete embedding geometries, being in
perfect analogy with the spectra of geometrical operators in LQG with a
nondegenerate vacuum geometry.

satellites around the M31 galaxy with a vertical rms scatter of ~12 kpc and a
radial extent of ~ 300 kpc (Ibata et al. 2013). We show that a thin satellite
disc can persist over cosmological times if and only if it lies in the planes

equatorial or polar planes of a spheroidal halo. In any other orientation, then
the disc thickness doubles on ~5 Gyr timescales and so must have been born with

through dense, hydrostatic granular packings mainly depend on the local surface
orientation and can be seen as the sum of the forces exerted on small surface
elements. In order to understand such forces more deeply, we perform 2D
soft-sphere molecular dynamics simulation, on similar set up, of an intruder
dragged through a 50-50 bi-disperse granular packing, with diameters 0.30 and
0.34 cm. We measure, for both circular and half-circle shapes, the forces
parallel (drag) and perpendicular (lift) to the drag direction as functions of
the drag speed, with V=10.3-309 cm/s, and intruder depths, with D=3.75-37.5 cm.
The drag forces on an intruder monotonically increase with V and D, and are
larger for the circle. However, the lift force does not depend monotonically on
V and D, and this relationship is affected by the shape of the intruder. The
vertical force was negative for the half-circle, but for a small range of V and
D, we measure positive lift. We find no sign change for the lift on the circle,
which is always positive. The explanation for the nonmonotonic dependence is
related to the decrease in contacts on the intruder as V increases. This is
qualitatively similar to supersonic flow detachment from an obstacle. The
detachment picture is supported by simulation measurements of the velocity
field around the intruder and force profiles measured on its surface.

  Why does Python lag so far behind these other languages? As we show, the very

over the length function (length constraints), and membership in regular sets.
These questions are important in logic, program analysis, and formal
verification. Variants of these questions have been studied for many decades by
mathematicians. More recently, practical satisfiability procedures (aka SMT
solvers) for these formulas have become increasingly important in the context
of security analysis for string-manipulating programs such as web applications.
  We prove three main theorems. First, we give a new proof of undecidability
for the validity problem for the set of sentences written as a forall-exists
quantifier alternation applied to positive word equations. A corollary of this
undecidability result is that this set is undecidable even with sentences with
at most two occurrences of a string variable. Second, we consider Boolean
combinations of quantifier-free formulas constructed out of word equations and
length constraints. We show that if word equations can be converted to a solved
form, a form relevant in practice, then the satisfiability problem for Boolean
combinations of word equations and length constraints is decidable. Third, we
show that the satisfiability problem for quantifier-free formulas over word
equations in regular solved form, length constraints, and the membership

We compute their total keyrate as function of the channel transmission T, using
general information theoretical arguments and we show that they have a higher
keyrate than the more standard protocols, both for fixed and optimized average
photon number of the WCPs. When no decoy-state protocols (DSPs) are applied,
the scaling of the keyrate with transmission is improved from T<sup>2</sup> for
BB84 to T^(1+1/(m-2)). If a DSP is applied, we show how the keyrates scale
linearly with T, with an improvement of the prefactor by 75.96 % for m=4. High
values of $ m $ allow to asymptotically approach the keyrate obtained with
ideal single photon pulses. The fact that the keyrates of these sifting-less

protocols show that the latter are not optimal, since they do not extract all
the available secret key from the experimental correlations.

which occurred in an active region with a circular magnetic polarity inversion
line (PIL). The impulsive phase of the flare starts with a main elongated
source that darkens in D3, inside of which bright emission kernels appear at
the time of the initial small peak in hard X-rays (HXRs). These flare cores
subsequently evolve into a sharp emission strand lying within the dark halo
simultaneously with the main peak in HXRs, reversing the overall source
contrast from -5% to 5%. The radiated energy in D3 during the main peak is
estimated to be about 10^30 ergs, which is comparable to that carried by
nonthermal electrons above 20 keV. Afterwards the flare proceeds along the
circular PIL in the counterclockwise direction to form a dark circular ribbon
in D3, which apparently mirrors the bright ribbons in Halpha and He I 10830 A.
All these ribbons last for over one hour in the late gradual phase. We suggest
that the present event resembles the so-called black-light flare that is
proposed based on continuum images, and that D3 darkening and brightening

the direct precipitation of high-energy electrons.

out false by a counter example of Y. L. Ou and L. Tang in \cite{Ou-Ta}. However
it remains interesting to find out sufficient conditions which guarantee this

  1. Any complete biharmonic submanifold (resp. hypersurface) $(M, g)$ in a
Riemannian manifold $(N, h)$ with non-positive sectional curvature (resp. Ricci

$\int_{M}|\vec{H}|^{p}du_g<+\infty,$ where $\vec{H}$ is the mean curvature
vector field of $M\hookrightarrow N$, must be minimal. This generalizes the
recent results due to N. Nakauchi and H. Urakawa in \cite{Na-Ur1} and
\cite{Na-Ur2}.
  2. Any complete biharmonic submanifold (resp. hypersurface) in a Reimannian

growth of $\rho$, must be minimal.

$\varepsilon$-superbiharmonic submanifolds, which generalize the result in

the confidence of each detection. Among other tests, we validated the planet
candidates by analyzing correlations of each Doppler signal activity indices

described better by six Keplerian-like signals: the two known candidates (b and
c); three additional few-Earth mass candidates with periods of 92, 62 and 39
days (d, e and f); a cold super-Earth in a 260-day orbit (g) and tantalizing
evidence of a $\sim$ 1 M$_\oplus$ object in a close-in orbit of 17 days (h). We
explore whether long-term stable orbits are compatible with the data by
integrating 8$\times 10^4$ solutions derived from the Bayesian samplings. The
system consisting of six planets is compatible with dynamically stable
configurations. As for the solar system, the most stable solutions do not
contain mean-motion resonances and are described well by analytic
Laplace-Lagrange solutions. The presence of a seventh planet (h) is supported
by the fact that it appears squarely centered on the only island of stability
left in the six-planet solution. Habitability assessments accounting for the
stellar flux, as well as tidal dissipation effects, indicate that three (maybe
four) planets are potentially habitable...

with 60-80 pc scale-height - comparable to the star-forming disk of the Milky
Way - is visibly evident and required to fit the attenuation-corrected light
distribution. Asymmetries in the super-thin disk light profile are indicative
of young, hot stars producing regions of excess luminosity and bluer
(attenuation-corrected) near-infrared color. To fit the inner regions of NGC
891, these disks must be truncated within ~3 kpc, with almost all their
luminosity redistributed in a bar-like structure 50% thicker than the thin
disk. There appears to be no classical bulge but rather a nuclear continuation
of the super-thin disk. The super-thin, thin, thick, and bar components
contribute roughly 30%, 42%, 13%, and 15% (respectively) to the total Ks-band

significantly affect and improve the agreement between neutrino oscillation
models with light sterile neutrinos and short baseline experimental results,
allowing for a new source of CP violation in appearance experiments and for
different apparent mixing angles in appearance and disappearance experiments.
However in refs. Phys. Rev. D 86, 033015 (2012) and JHEP 1204, 083 (2012) it

sterile neutrinos, and show that the resulting model is a consistent theory of
neutrino oscillation anomalies and dark matter which can also potentially
explain the INTEGRAL excess of 511 keV gamma rays in the central region of the

weakly interacting electrons to topologically nontrivial backgrounds such as in
polyacetylene. Here we demonstrate that electronic fractionalization combining
features of both these mechanisms occurs in noncoplanar itinerant magnetic
systems, where integer quantum Hall physics arises from the coupling of
electrons to the magnetic background. The topologically stable magnetic
vortices in such systems carry fractional (in general irrational) electronic

we contrast models with purely poloidal magnetic fields to models dominated by
a strong internal toroidal component. We find that, while the former displays
double peaked profiles and very low pulsed fractions, in the latter, the
anisotropy in the surface temperature produced by the toroidal field often
results in a single pulse profile, with pulsed fractions that can exceed the
50-60% level even for perfectly isotropic local emission. We further use our
theoretical results to generate simulated ""observed"" spectra, and show that
blackbody (BB) fits result in inferred radii that can be significantly smaller

internal toroidal fields and a high absorption column density along their line

concept of singular limiting induced from continuum solution (or
slic-solution), according to which a discontinuous motion is a slic-solution if
its averages form a family of smooth approximate solutions to the problem. It
turns out that there is an energetic cost for creating the cavity, which is
captured by the notion of slic-solution but neglected by the usual entropic
weak solutions. Once this cost is accounted for, the total mechanical energy of
the cavitating solution is in fact larger than that of the homogeneously

hard scattering of a single dark matter particle, we are searching for the
coherent effects of the entire classical dark matter field. We calculate
current bounds on such time varying moments and consider a technique utilizing

used the SIR code to invert the spectra. Most of the line parameters from the

further derive a new constraint on the superluminal electron velocity, obtained
from the observation of synchrotron radiation in the Crab Nebula flare of
September, 2010. The inference that the $>$ 1 GeV $\gamma$-rays from
synchrotron emission in the flare were produced by electrons of energy up to

these electrons. This implies a new, strong constraint on superluminal electron
velocities $\delta_e \le \sim 5 \times 10^{-21}$. It immediately follows that
one then obtains an upper limit on the superluminal neutrino velocity {\it

However, if the electrons are {\it subluminal} the constraint on $|\delta_e|

in the cochains of a sub double complex of the double bar resolution associated
to the semi-direct product $K \rtimes G$; we use known calculations of the
cohomology of $K$, $G$ and $K \rtimes G$ to produce concrete examples of our
classification.
  In the case in which $K=G$ and $G$ acts by conjugation, the multiplication
map $G \rtimes G \to G$ is a homomorphism of groups and we define a shuffle
homomorphism which realizes this map at the homological level. We show that the
categorical information that defines the Twisted Drinfeld Double can be
realized as the dual of the shuffle homomorphism applied to any 3-cocycle of
$G$. We use the pullback of the multiplication map in cohomology to classify
the possible ring structures that the Grothendieck ring of representations of
the Twisted Drinfeld Double may have, and we include concrete examples of this
procedure.

among multiple neurons by detecting their co-firing (possibly with some lag
time) patterns over time. After discretizing time so there is at most one spike
at each interval, the resulting sequence of 1's (spike) and 0's (silence) for
each neuron is modeled using the logistic function of a continuous latent
variable with a Gaussian process prior. For multiple neurons, the corresponding
marginal distributions are coupled to their joint probability distribution
using a parametric copula model. The advantages of our approach are as follows:
the nonparametric component (i.e., the Gaussian process model) provides a
flexible framework for modeling the underlying firing rates; the parametric
component (i.e., the copula model) allows us to make inference regarding both
contemporaneous and lagged relationships among neurons; using the copula model,
we construct multivariate probabilistic models by separating the modeling of
univariate marginal distributions from the modeling of dependence structure
among variables; our method is easy to implement using a computationally
efficient sampling algorithm that can be easily extended to high dimensional
problems. Using simulated data, we show that our approach could correctly
capture temporal dependencies in firing rates and identify synchronous neurons.
We also apply our model to spike train data obtained from prefrontal cortical
areas in rat's brain.

can manifest at colliders in a host of different signatures, including some
that significantly differ from those of the minimal models. Depending on the
choice of the hierarchy of couplings, the decay of the heavy quarks and of the
seesaw triplet may be subject to bounds that can be tighter or looser than the
bounds from standard LHC searches. Furthermore we point out a new

simultaneous propagation of the type II triplet and exotic fermions. Remarkably
this contribution to the neutrinoless double beta decay is parametrically quite

recombination lines whose kinematics are discrepant: They are incompatible with
the ionization structure derived from all other evidence and the kinematics
derived from all of these lines are unexpectedly very similar. We find direct
evidence for a recombination contribution to [N II] 5755. Once taken into
account, the electron temperatures from [N II], [O III], and [Ne III] agree at
a given position and velocity. The electron densities derived from [O II] and
[Ar IV] are consistent with direct imaging and the distribution of hydrogen
emission. The kinematics of the C II, N II, O II, and Ne II lines does not
coincide with the kinematics of the [O III] and [Ne III] forbidden emission,
indicating that there is an additional plasma component to the recombination
emission that arises from a different volume from that giving rise to the
forbidden emission from the parent ions within NGC 7009. Thus, the chemical
abundances derived from either type of line are correct only for the plasma
component from which they arise. Apart from [N II] 5755, we find no anomaly

identify the absorbing galaxies and determine their impact parameters, 2)
confirm the galaxy cluster candidates in the vicinity of each quasar sightline,

main findings are: 1) the identification of 10 out of 24 absorbing galaxies

is a remarkable result since we defined a photometric hit as those
cluster-absorber pairs having a redshift difference dz = 0.1. Absorbing
cluster-galaxies hosting weak absorbers are consistent with lower star
formation activity than the rest, which produce strong absorption and agree
with typical MgII absorbing galaxies found in the literature. Our spectroscopic
confirmations lend support to the selection of photometric hits made in Lopez

Affleck-Dine baryogenesis to occur. It has been shown that adding a chiral
multiplet S coupled to the inflaton (with a shift symmetry) can serve to
stabilize the inflationary potential and allows one to derive simple
inflationary potentials without an eta problem. Here, we show that by coupling
the same stabilizing field S to the flat direction, may naturally lead to a
negative mass-squared contribution to the flat direction thus generating the
necessarily large vacuum expectation value needed to realize Affleck-Dine
baryogenesis. We trace the evolution of the inflaton, stabilizer, and flat
direction field, as well as a Polonyi-like modulus responsible for soft
supersymmetry breaking.

boson interaction parameter with the simultaneous switching on of a
commensurate periodic potential, the latter providing a source of non-linearity
that can cause inelastic scattering. A quantum kinetic equation is derived
perturbatively in the periodic potential and solved within the leading order
gradient expansion. A two-particle irreducible formalism is employed to
construct the stress-momentum tensor and hence the conserved energy. The
dynamics is studied in detail in the phase where the boson spectrum remains
gapless. The periodic potential is found to give rise to multi-particle
scattering processes that relaxes the boson distribution function. At long
times the system is found to thermalize with a thermalization time that depends
in a non-monotonic way on the amount of energy injected into the system due to
the quantum quench. This non-monotonic behavior arises due to the competing
effect of an increase of phase space for scattering on the one hand, and an
enhancement of the orthogonality catastrophe on the other hand as the quench
amplitude is increased. The approach to equilibrium is found to be purely
exponential for large quench amplitudes, and more complex for smaller quench
amplitudes.

Harper model (KHM), an on-resonance double kicked rotor model (ORDKR) also has
Hofstadter's butterfly Floquet spectrum, with strong resemblance to the
standard Hofstadter's spectrum that is a paradigm in studies of the integer
quantum Hall effect. Earlier it was shown that the quasi-energy spectra of
these two dynamical models (i) can exactly overlap with each other if an
effective Planck constant takes irrational multiples of 2*pi and (ii) will be
different if the same parameter takes rational multiples of 2*pi. This work
makes some detailed comparisons between these two models, with an effective
Planck constant given by 2*pi M/N, where M and N are coprime and odd integers.
It is found that the ORDKR spectrum (with two periodic kicking sequences having
the same kick strength) has one flat band and $N-1$ non-flat bands whose
largest width decays in power law as K to the power of N+2, where K is a
kicking strength parameter. The existence of a flat band is strictly proven and
the power law scaling, numerically checked for a number of cases, is also
analytically proven for a three-band case. By contrast, the KHM does not have
any flat band and its band width scales linearly with K. This is shown to
result in dramatic differences in dynamical behavior, such as transient (but
extremely long) dynamical localization in ORDKR, which is absent in KHM.
Finally, we show that despite these differences, there exist simple extensions
of KHM and ORDKR (upon introducing an additional periodic phase parameter) such
that the resulting extended KHM and ORDKR are actually topologically
equivalent, i.e., they yield exactly the same Floquet-band Chern numbers and
display topological phase transitions at the same kick strengths. A theoretical
derivation of this topological equivalence is provided.

present general dichromatic and forest-expansion polynomials that are Tutte

fermions. Based on an analytic expression for a static two-soliton magnetic
texture we perform a systematic numerical study of the propagation of Dirac
wave packets along such intersections. A single-cone staggered-grid finite

that the angle of intersection plays a decisive role in determining the

width and, to a lesser extent, the type of domain walls, e.g. Bloch or
N{\'e}el, determine the properties of the splitter. As the ratio between

probabilities can be assigned to various quantum events or sequences of events

demonstrated how this issue can be successfully addressed within the consistent
histories approach to quantum theory for Wheeler-DeWitt-quantized cosmological
models. In this work, we generalize that analysis to the exactly solvable loop
quantization of a spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic cosmology sourced
with a massless, minimally coupled scalar field known as sLQC. We provide an
explicit, rigorous and complete decoherent histories formulation for this model
and compute the probabilities for the occurrence of a quantum bounce vs. a
singularity. Using the scalar field as an emergent internal time, we show for
generic states that the probability for a singularity to occur in this model is
zero, and that of a bounce is unity, complementing earlier studies of the
expectation values of the volume and matter density in this theory. We also
show from the consistent histories point of view that all states in this model,
whether quantum or classical, achieve arbitrarily large volume in the limit of
infinite `past' or `future' scalar `time', in the sense that the wave function
evaluated at any arbitrary fixed value of the volume vanishes in that limit.
Finally, we briefly discuss certain misconceptions concerning the utility of
the consistent histories approach in these models.

in size. The total HI image and the kinematics show that the cloud consists of
condensations that have small (~10 km/s) motions with respect to each other.
The column densities of the HI are low; the observed peak value is 7.1x10^{19}
cm^{-2}. The velocity field shows a mild velocity gradient over the body of GBT
1355+5439, possibly due to rotation, but it may also indicate large-scale
radial motions. Although our data are limited in sensitivity, at all positions
the HI velocity dispersion is higher than 5 km/s and no narrow, cold, HI
component is seen. Because its distance is not known, we considered various
possibilities for the nature of GBT 1355+5439. Both the scenarios that it is a
tidal remnant near M101 and that it is a dark dwarf companion of M101 meet
difficulties. Neither do the data fit the properties of known compact
High-Velocity Clouds in the Galactic halo exactly, but we cannot entirely
exclude this option and deeper observations are required. We also considered
the possibility that GBT 1355+5439 is a gas-rich dark minihalo in the outer
regions of the Local Group. Interestingly, it would then have similar
properties as the clouds of a proposed Local Group population recently found in
the ALFALFA survey. In this case, the HI mass of GBT 1355+5439 would be about a
few times 10^5 Msol, its size about 1 kpc, and the dynamical mass M_dyn >
5x10^7 Msol. However, if GBT 1355+5439 is a dark Local Group object, the
internal kinematics of the HI appears to be different from that of
gas-dominated, almost dark galaxies of similar size.

(pi,pi), is assumed to represent the pseudo-gap (PG) state of a hole-doped
cuprate superconductor. The pairing interaction required for the PG phase
corresponds to a repulsive interaction of Coulombic origin. The d-wave
superconductivity (DSC), driven by an appropriate assumed attractive
interaction, is discussed within the mean-field framework together with the
CDDW ordering. The single-particle excitation spectrum in the CDDW and DSC
state is characterized by the Bogolubov quasi-particle bands-a characteristic
feature of SC state. The coupled gap equations are solved self-consistently
together with the equation to determine the chemical potential. With the
pinning of the van Hove-singularities close to the chemical potential, one is
able to calculate the thermodynamic and transport properties of the under-doped
cuprates in a consistent manner. The electronic specific heat displays
non-Fermi liquid feature in the CDDW state. The CDDW and DSC are found to
represent two competing orders as the former brings about a depletion of the
spectral weight (and Raman response function density) available for pairing in
the anti-nodal region of momentum space.This is not in agreement with a
preformed pairing scenario and justifies the different structures we have
assumed for the pseudo-gap and the superconducting gap. Furthermore, these gaps
in the excitation spectrum do not merge into a single quadrature gap. It is
also shown that the depletion of the spectral weight below Tc at energies
larger than the gap amplitude occurs. This is an indication of the
strong-coupling superconductivity in cuprates. The calculation of the ratio of
the quasi-particle thermal conductivity and temperature in the superconductiong
phase is found to be constant in the limit of near-zero quasi-particle
scattering rate.

correlations, we use analytical or semi-analytical models, based on a
hierarchical ansatz or a combination of one-loop perturbation theory with a

bias is typically several orders of magnitude below the weak lensing signal,
except when we correlate a very low-redshift galaxy ($z_2 \la 0.05$) with a
higher redshift galaxy ($z_1 \ga 0.5$), where it can reach $10\%$ of the signal
for the shear. For three-point statistics, the source-lens clustering bias is
typically of order $10\%$ of the signal, as soon as the three galaxy source
redshifts are not identical. The intrinsic-alignment bias is typically about
$10\%$ of the signal for both two-point and three-point statistics. Thus, both

agricultural crop species and are among the most important of all plant
pathogens. As yet however we have little understanding of their origins or the
genomic basis of their extreme polyphagy. The most damaging pathogens reproduce
by mitotic parthenogenesis and are suggested to originate by interspecific
hybridizations between unknown parental taxa. We sequenced the genome of the
diploid meiotic parthenogen Meloidogyne floridensis, and use a comparative
genomic approach to test the hypothesis that it was involved in the hybrid
origin of the tropical mitotic parthenogen M. incognita. Phylogenomic analysis
of gene families from M. floridensis, M. incognita and an outgroup species M.
hapla was used to trace the evolutionary history of these species' genomes,
demonstrating that M. floridensis was one of the parental species in the hybrid
origins of M. incognita. Analysis of the M. floridensis genome revealed many
gene loci present in divergent copies, as they are in M. incognita, indicating
that it too had a hybrid origin. The triploid M. incognita is shown to be a
complex double-hybrid between M. floridensis and a third, unidentified parent.
The agriculturally important RKN have very complex origins involving the mixing
of several parental genomes by hybridization and their extreme polyphagy and
agricultural success may be related to this hybridization, producing
transgressive variation on which natural selection acts. Studying RKN variation
via individual marker loci may fail due to the species' convoluted origins, and
multi-species population genomics is essential to understand the hybrid
diversity and adaptive variation of this important species complex. This
comparative genomic analysis provides a compelling example of the importance
and complexity of hybridization in generating animal species diversity more
generally.

characteristics such as vortex line density, anisotropic and curvature
parameters of the vortex tangle, we stress other dynamical and statistical
characteristics which are either much less studied or even unstudied. The
latter include reconnection rates, mean mutual friction forces, drift
velocities and the probability distribution functions of various tangle
parameters: the loop length, the line curvature, the mean curvature of loops
with a given length, etc. During these studies we compare the three main
reconnection procedures which are widely used in the literature, and identify
which properties are strongly affected by the choice of the reconnection
criteria and which of them are practically insensitive to the reconnection
procedure. The conclusion is that the vortex filament method in the framework
of the Biot-Savart equation sufficiently robust and well suited for the
description of the steady state vortex tangle in a quantum counterflow. The
Local-Induction Approximation to this equation may be successfully used to

path for the next-generation cellular networks. However, with more and more
irregularly deployed base stations (BSs), it is becoming increasingly difficult
to quantify the achievable network throughput or energy efficiency. In this
paper, we develop an analytical framework for downlink performance evaluation
of small cell networks, based on a random spatial network model, where BSs and
users are modeled as two independent spatial Poisson point processes. A new
simple expression of the outage probability is derived, which is analytically
tractable and is especially useful with multi-antenna transmissions. This new
result is then applied to evaluate the network throughput and energy
efficiency. It is analytically shown that deploying more BSs or more BS
antennas can always increase the network throughput, but the performance gain
critically depends on the BS-user density ratio and the number of BS antennas.
On the other hand, increasing the BS density or the number of transmit antennas
will first increase and then decrease the energy efficiency if different
components of BS power consumption satisfy certain conditions, and the optimal
BS density and the optimal number of BS antennas can be found. Otherwise, the
energy efficiency will always decrease. Simulation results shall demonstrate
that our conclusions based on the random network model are general and also
hold in a regular grid-based model.

scale of the Universe as a whole at any stage of its evolution. These phenomena
are a direct consequence of the zero rest mass of gravitons, conformal
non-invariance of the graviton field, and one-loop finiteness of quantum
gravity. The effects are due to graviton-ghost condensates arising from the
interference of quantum coherent states. Each of coherent states is a state of
gravitons and ghosts of a wavelength of the order of the horizon scale and of
different occupation numbers. The state vector of the Universe is a coherent
superposition of vectors of different occupation numbers. To substantiate the
reliability of macroscopic quantum effects, the formalism of one-loop quantum
gravity is discussed in detail. The theory is constructed as follows:
Faddeev-Popov path integral in Hamilton gauge -> factorization of classical and
quantum variables, allowing the existence of a self-consistent system of
equations for gravitons, ghosts and macroscopic geometry -> transition to the
one-loop approximation. The ghost sector corresponding to the Hamilton gauge
ensures of one-loop finiteness of the theory off the mass shell. The
Bogolyubov-Born-Green-Kirckwood-Yvon (BBGKY) chain for the spectral function of
gravitons renormalized by ghosts is used to build a self-consistent theory of
gravitons in the isotropic Universe. We found three exact solutions of the
equations, consisting of BBGKY chain and macroscopic Einstein's equations. The
solutions describe virtual graviton, ghost, and instanton condensates and are
reproduced at the level of exact solutions for field operators and state
vectors. Each exact solution corresponds to a certain phase state of
graviton-ghost substratum. We establish conditions under which a continuous
quantum-gravity phase transitions occur between different phases of the
graviton-ghost condensate.

Pulsing Asymptotic Giant Branch (TP-AGB) phase computed with the COLIBRI code.
We use a formalism of dust growth coupled with a stationary wind for both M and
C-stars. In the original version of this formalism, the most efficient
destruction process of silicate dust in M-giants is chemisputtering by H2
molecules. For these stars we find that dust grains can only form at relatively
large radial distances (r~5 R*), where they cannot be efficiently accelerated,
in agreement with other investigations. In the light of recent laboratory
results, we also consider the alternative case that the condensation
temperature of silicates is determined only by the competition between growth
and free evaporation processes (i.e. no chemisputtering). With this latter
approach we obtain dust condensation temperatures that are significantly higher
(up to Tcond~1400 K) than those found when chemisputtering is included
(Tcond~900 K), and in better agreement with condensation experiments. As a
consequence, silicate grains can remain stable in inner regions of the
circumstellar envelopes (r~2 R*), where they can rapidly grow and can be
efficiently accelerated. With this modification, our models nicely reproduce
the observed trend between terminal velocities and mass loss rates of Galactic
M-giants. For C-stars the formalism is based on the homogeneous growth scheme
where the key role is played by the carbon over oxygen excess. The models
reproduce fairly well the terminal velocities of Galactic stars and there is no
need to invoke changes in the standard assumptions. At decreasing metallicity
the carbon excess becomes more pronounced and the efficiency of dust formation
increases. This trend could be in tension with recent observational evidence in
favour of a decreasing efficiency, at decreasing metallicity.

already known in the Einstein frame, we give expressions for the power

two analytically soluble examples, the first involving a non-minimally coupled
`spectator' field and the second being a non-minimally coupled extension of the
multi-brid inflation model. In the first model we find that predictions can
easily be brought into agreement with the recent Planck results, as the
tensor-to-scalar ratio is generally small, the spectral tilt tuneable and the
non-gaussianity suppressed. In the second model we find that predictions for

particular emphasis is the flows whose angular velocity decreases but specific
angular momentum increases with increasing radial coordinate. Such flows,
however, are Rayleigh stable, but must be turbulent in order to explain
astrophysical observed data and, hence, reveal a mismatch between the linear
theory and observations/experiments. The mismatch seems to have been resolved,
atleast in certain regimes, in the presence of weak magnetic field revealing
magnetorotational instability. The present work explores the effects of
stochastic noise on such magnetohydrodynamic flows, in order to resolve the
above mismatch generically for the hot flows. We essentially concentrate on a
small section of such a flow which is nothing but a plane shear flow
supplemented by the Coriolis effect, mimicking a small section of an
astrophysical accretion disk around a compact object. It is found that such
stochastically driven flows exhibit large temporal and spatial
auto-correlations and cross-correlations of perturbation and hence large energy
dissipations of perturbation, which generate instability. Interestingly,
auto-correlations and cross-correlations appear independent of background
angular velocity profiles, which are Rayleigh stable, indicating their
universality. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first attempt to
understand the evolution of three-dimensional hydromagnetic perturbations in
rotating shear flows in the presence of stochastic noise.

results. We are trying to answer questions such as: How fit is the immune

to improve the effectiveness of a simultaneous vaccination? Understanding the
processes of immune system aging and degradation may also help in development
of therapies that reverse some of the damages caused thus improving life
expectancy. Therefore as a first step our research focuses on T cells; major
contributors to immune system functionality. One of the main factors
influencing immune system aging is the output rate of naive T cells. Of further
interest is the number and phenotypical variety of these cells in an
individual, which will be the case study focused on in this paper.

with multi-frequency, multi-epoch VLBI observations. The combination of both,
morphological and spectral parameters can be used to derive source intrinsic
physical properties such as the magnetic field and the non-thermal particle
density. In the first two papers of this series, we analyzed the single-dish
light curves and the VLBI kinematics of the blazar CTA 102 and suggested a
shock-shock interaction between a traveling and a standing shock wave as a
possible scenario to explain the observed evolution of the component associated
to the 2006 flare. In this paper we investigate the core-shift and spectral
evolution to test our hypothesis of a shock-shock interaction. We used 8
multi-frequency VLBA observations to analyze the temporal and spatial evolution
of the spectral parameters during the flare. We observed CTA 102 between May
2005 and April 2007 using the VLBA at six different frequencies spanning from 2
- 86 GHz. After the calibrated VLBA images were corrected for opacity, we
performed a detailed spectral analysis. From the derived values we estimated
the magnetic field and the density of the relativistic particles. The detailed
analysis of the opacity shift reveals that the position of the jet core is
proportional to nu^-1 with some temporal variations. The value suggests
possible equipartition between magnetic field energy and particle kinetic
energy densities at the most compact regions. From the variation of the
physical parameters we deduced that the 2006 flare in CTA 102 is connected to
the ejection of a new traveling feature (t=2005.9) and the interaction between
this shock wave and a stationary structure around 0.1 mas from the core. The
source kinematics together with the spectral and structural variations can be
described by helical motions in an over-pressured jet.

Here we propose to adapt the ""thermal plume"" model, recently developed for
Earth climate modeling, to Martian GCMs, MMs, and single-column models. The aim
of this physically-based parameterization is to represent the effect of
organized turbulent structures (updrafts and downdrafts) on the daytime PBL
transport, as it is resolved in Large-Eddy Simulations [LESs]. We find that the
terrestrial thermal plume model needs to be modified to satisfyingly account
for deep turbulent plumes found in the Martian convective PBL. Our Martian
thermal plume model qualitatively and quantitatively reproduces the thermal
structure of the daytime PBL on Mars: superadiabatic near-surface layer, mixing
layer, and overshoot region at PBL top. This model is coupled to surface layer
parameterizations taking into account stability and turbulent gustiness to
calculate surface-atmosphere fluxes. Those new parameterizations for the
surface and mixed layers are validated against near-surface lander
measurements. Using a thermal plume model moreover enables a first order
estimation of key turbulent quantities (e.g. PBL height, convective plume
velocity) in Martian GCMs and MMs without having to run costly LESs.

induced by dark energy. One model for dark energy is a positive cosmological
constant. It is consequently of interest to study Einstein's equations with a
positive cosmological constant coupled to matter satisfying the ordinary energy
conditions; the dominant energy condition etc. Due to the difficulty of
analysing the behaviour of solutions to Einstein's equations in general, it is
common to either study situations with symmetry, or to prove stability results.
In the present paper, we do both. In fact, we analyse, in detail, the future
asymptotic behaviour of T^3-Gowdy symmetric solutions to the Einstein-Vlasov
equations with a positive cosmological constant. In particular, we prove the
cosmic no-hair conjecture in this setting. However, we also prove that the
solutions are future stable (in the class of all solutions). Some of the
results hold in a more general setting. In fact, we obtain conclusions
concerning the causal structure of T^2-symmetric solutions, assuming only the
presence of a positive cosmological constant, matter satisfying various energy
conditions and future global existence. Adding the assumption of T^3-Gowdy
symmetry to this list of requirements, we obtain C^0-estimates for all but one
of the metric components. There is consequently reason to expect that many of

is surprisingly simple, and has in contrast to the usual definitions of

While the idea of a coinductive treatment of infinitary rewriting is not new,
all previous approaches were limited to reductions of length at most omega. The
approach presented in this paper is the first to capture the full infinitary
term rewriting with reductions of arbitrary ordinal length. Apart from an

additional information of a pinhole plane image taken at every excitation scan

that the most probable position of an emitter is at half way between the
nominal focus of the excitation laser and the position corresponding to the
(off centre) detection position. Therefore, by reassigning the detected photons
to this place, an image with enhanced detection efficiency and resolution is
obtained. Here we present optical photon reassignment microscopy (OPRA) which
realises this concept in an all-optical way obviating the need for
image-processing. With the help of an additional intermediate optical beam
expansion between descanning and a further rescanning of the detected light, an
image with the advantages of photon reassignment can be acquired. Due to its
simplicity and flexibility this method has the potential to enhance the
performance of nearly every laser scanning microscope and is therefore expected

its size and thus of vital importance for high energy astrophysics. In spite of
the wealth of data on the emission of luminous accreting neutron stars, the
emission of their surfaces is hard to disentangle from their time averaged
spectra. A recent X-ray transient source XTE J1701-462 has provided a unique
dataset covering the largest ever observed luminosity range for a single
source. In this paper, we extract the spectrum of the boundary layer between
the inner part of the accretion disc and the neutron star surface with the help
of maximally spectral model-independent method. We show compelling evidences
that the energy spectrum of the boundary layer stays virtually the same over
factor of 20 variations of the source luminosity. It is rather wide and cannot
be described by a single temperature blackbody spectrum, probably because of
the inhomogeneity of the boundary layer and a spread in the colour temperature.
The observed maximum colour temperature of the boundary/spreading layer
emission of kT~2.4-2.6 keV is very close to the maximum observed colour
temperature in the photospheric radius expansion X-ray bursts, which is set by
the limiting Eddington flux at the neutron star surface. Observed stability of
the boundary layer spectrum and its maximum colour temperature strongly
supports theoretical models of the boundary/spreading layers on surfaces of
luminous accreting neutron stars, which assume the presence of a region
emitting at the local Eddington limit. Variations in the luminosity in that
case lead to changes in the size of this region, but affect less the spectral
shape. Elaboration of this model will provide solid theoretical grounds for
measurements of the neutron star sizes using the emission of the
boundary/spreading layers of luminous accreting neutron stars.

succeeds at SNR levels that are a factor log n less than required by standard

compressed sensing. CASS is also demonstrated to perform considerably better in

adaptive versions of such methods can also improve detection and estimation

by Dvali and Gomez is the estimate of the number of soft quanta that make up
the classical gravitational field. It is argued here that the coherent state
formalism provides a way to calculate that number directly. As a consequence,
the average energy of the soft quanta is such that the typical geometric size
of the field source can be roughly interpreted as their de Broglie wavelength.
The calculation is done for the electromagnetic field and for Newtonian
gravity, and it is argued that the number of soft quanta should be unchanged in
General Relativity due to the long range nature of gravity.

vector coupling ($G_V$) devoting special attention to the low temperature
region of the phase diagram to show how this type of interaction
counterbalances the effects produced by a strong magnetic field. The most
important effects occur at intermediate and low temperatures affecting the
location of the critical end point as well as the region of first order chiral
transitions. When $G_V=0$ the presence of high magnetic fields ($eB \ge 10
m_\pi^2$) increases the density coexistence region with respect to the case
when $B$ and $G_V$ are absent while a decrease of this region is observed at
high $G_V$ values and vanishing magnetic fields. Another interesting aspect
observed at the low temperature region is that the usual decrease of the
coexistence chemical value (Inverse Magnetic Catalysis) at $G_V=0$ is highly
affected by the presence of the vector interaction which acts in the opposite
way. Our investigation also shows that the presence of a repulsive vector
interaction enhances the de Haas-van Alphen oscillations which, for very low
temperatures, take place at $eB \lesssim 6 m_\pi^2$. We observe that the
presence of a magnetic field, together with a repulsive vector interaction,
gives rise to a complex transition pattern since $B$ favors the appearance of
multiple solutions to the gap equation whereas $G_V$ turns some metastable
solutions into stable ones allowing for a cascade of transitions to occur.

for interpreting experimental results, understanding physical mechanisms and
predicting the performance of high-temperature superconductor (HTS) tapes,

sufficiently low ac loss value is imperative to make these materials attractive
for commercialization. In recent years, a large variety of numerical models,
based on different techniques and implementations, have been proposed by
researchers around the world, with the purpose of being able to estimate ac
losses in HTSs quickly and accurately. This article presents a literature
review of the methods for computing ac losses in HTS tapes, wires and devices.
Technical superconductors have a relatively complex geometry (filaments, which
might be twisted or transposed, or layers) and consist of different materials.
As a result, different loss contributions exist. In this paper, we describe the
ways of computing such loss contributions, which include hysteresis losses,
eddy current losses, coupling losses, and losses in ferromagnetic materials. We
also provide an estimation of the losses occurring in a variety of power
applications.

segmentation in images, in which the user initializes a contour which evolves
in order to optimize an objective function designed such that the desired
object boundary is the optimal solution. Recently, imaging modalities that
produce Manifold valued images have come up, for example, DT-MRI images, vector
fields. The traditional active contour model does not work on such images. In
this paper, we generalize the active contour model to work on Manifold valued
images. As expected, our algorithm detects regions with similar Manifold values
in the image. Our algorithm also produces expected results on usual gray-scale
images, since these are nothing but trivial examples of Manifold valued images.
As another application of our general active contour model, we perform texture
segmentation on gray-scale images by first creating an appropriate Manifold
valued image. We demonstrate segmentation results for manifold valued images

two-dimensional (2D) plasmon, as the collective motion of a system of two types
of electronic carriers coexisting in the very same 2D band of extrinsic (doped
or gated) graphene. The origin of this novel mode resides in the strong
anisotropy that is present in the graphene band structure near the Dirac point.
This anisotropy allows for the coexistence of carriers moving with two distinct
Fermi velocities along the Gamma-K direction, which leads to two modes of
collective oscillation: one mode in which the two types of electrons oscillate
in phase with one another [this is the conventional 2D graphene plasmon, which
at long wavelengths (q->0) has the same dispersion, q^1/2, as the conventional
2D plasmon of a 2D free electron gas], and the other mode found here
corresponding to a low-frequency acoustic oscillation [whose energy exhibits at
long wavelengths a linear dependence on the 2D wavenumber q] in which the two
types of electrons oscillate out of phase. If this prediction is confirmed
experimentally, it will represent the first realization of acoustic plasmons
originated in the collective motion of a system of two types of carriers
coexisting within the very same band.

commonly used HST/WFC3 filters, going from optical (F555W, F606W and F814W) to
near-infrared (F160W) bands. The importance of such a study is related to the
recent release of new classical Cepheids observed with HST/WFC3 in 8 distant
galaxies where SNIa are hosted. These observations have posed sound constraints
to the current distance scale with uncertainties on the Hubble constant Ho
smaller than 3%. Our models explore a large range of metallicity and Helium
content, thus providing a robust and unique theoretical tool for describing
these new and future HST/WFC3 observations. As expected, the Period-Luminosity
(PL) relation in F160W filter is linear and slightly dependent on the
metallicity when compared with optical bands, thus it seems the most accurate
tool to constrain extragalactic distances with Cepheids. We compare the
pulsation properties of Cepheids observed with HST/WFC3-IR with our theoretical
scenario and we discuss the agreement with the predicted Instability Strip for
all the investigated galaxy samples including the case of NGC4258. Finally,
adopting our theoretical F160W PL relation for Z=0.02 and log P>1.0, we derive
new distance moduli. In particular, for NGC 4258, we derive a distance modulus
mu0 = 29.345 +- 0.004 mag with a sigma = 0.34 mag, which is in very good
agreement with the geometrical maser value. Moreover, using the obtained
distance moduli, we estimate the Hubble constant value, Ho=76.0 +- 1.9 km s-1
Mpc-1 in excellent agreement with the most recent literature values.

both cases, the Beverloo scaling is recovered. We first do not attempt
quantitative comparison, but focus on the qualitative behavior of velocity and
pressure at different locations in the flow. A good agreement is obtained in
the regions of rapid flows, while areas of slow creep are not entirely captured
by the continuum model. The pressure field shows a general good agreement. The
evolution of the free surface implies differences, however, the bulk
deformation is essentially identical in both approaches. The influence of the
parameters of the mu(I)-flow-law is systematically investigated, showing the
importance of the dependence on the inertial number I to achieve quantitative

surface density (a factor of 2--4 higher) and electron density in the ionized

and of an array of shielded scintillation counters used for muon counting, Nmu.
KASCADE-Grande is optimized for cosmic ray measurements in the energy range 10
PeV to about 2000 PeV, where exploring the composition is of fundamental
importance for understanding the transition from galactic to extragalactic
origin of cosmic rays. Following earlier studies of the all-particle and the
elemental spectra reconstructed in the knee energy range from KASCADE data [T.
Antoni, et al. (KASCADE collaboration), Astropart. Phys. 24 (2005) 1], we have
now extended these measurements to beyond 200 PeV. By analysing the
two-dimensional shower size spectrum Nch vs. Nmu for nearly vertical events, we
reconstruct the energy spectra of different mass groups by means of unfolding
methods over an energy range where the detector is fully efficient. The
procedure and its results, which are derived based on the hadronic interaction
model QGSJET-II-02 and which yield a strong indication for a dominance of heavy
mass groups in the covered energy range and for a knee-like structure in the
iron spectrum at around 80 PeV, are presented. This confirms and further
refines the results obtained by other analyses of KASCADE-Grande data, which

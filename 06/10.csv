an accreting black hole contain information on the black hole mass and spin.
The promising observational signatures for the measurement of black hole mass
and spin are the latitudinal oscillation frequency of the bright spots in the
accretion flow and the frequency of black hole event horizon rotation. Both of
these frequencies are independent of the accretion model and defined completely
by the properties of the black hole gravitational field. Interpretation of the
known QPO data by dint of a signal modulation from the hot spots in the
accreting plasma reveals the Kerr metric rotation parameter, $a=0.65\pm0.05$,
and mass, $M=(4.2\pm0.2)10^6M_\odot$, of the supermassive black hole in the
Galactic center. At the same time, the observed 11.5 min QPO period is
identified with a period of the black hole event horizon rotation, and,
respectively, the 19 min period is identified with a latitudinal oscillation
period of hot spots in the accretion flow. The described approach is applicable
to black holes with a low accretion rate, when accreting plasma is transparent
up to the event horizon region.

generate the layout while taking into account the cost of communications and
classical resources as well as the maximum exploitable parallelism. In this
paper, we present and evaluate a design flow for arbitrary quantum circuits in
ion trap technology. Our design flow consists of two parts. First, a scheduler
takes a description of a circuit and finds the best order for the execution of
its quantum gates using integer linear programming (ILP) regarding the
classical resources (qubits) and instruction dependencies. Then a layout
generator receives the schedule produced by the scheduler and generates a
layout for this circuit using a graph-drawing algorithm. Our experimental
results show that the proposed flow decreases the average latency of quantum
circuits by about 11% for a set of attempted benchmarks and by about 9% for
another set of benchmarks compared with the best in literature.

massive rotating stars, of different ages in the context of tidal captures
leading to either giant exoplanets on close in orbits, or the formation of
binary systems in star clusters. To do this, we adopt approaches based on
normal mode and associated overlap integral evaluation, developed in a
companion paper by Ivanov et al., and direct numerical simulation, to evaluate
energy and angular momentum exchanges between the orbit and normal modes. The
two approaches are found to be in essential agreement apart from when
encounters occur near to pseudosynchronization, where the stellar angular
velocity and the orbital angular velocity at periastron are approximately
matched. We find that the strength of tidal interaction being expressed in
dimensionless natural units is significantly weaker for the more massive stars,
as compared to the solar mass stars, because of the lack of significant
convective regions in the former case. On the other hand the interaction is
found to be stronger for retrograde as opposed to prograde orbits in all cases.
In addition, for a given pericentre distance, tidal interactions also
strengthen for more evolved stars on account of their radial expansion. In
agreement with previous work based on simplified polytropic models, we find
that energy transferred to their central stars could play a significant role in
the early stages of the circularisation of potential 'Hot Jupiters'.

direction of a traveling wave of body bending, is a common mode of propulsion
used by animals in fluids, on land, and even within sand. As such it has been
an excellent system for discovery of neuromechanical principles of movement. In
nearly all animals studied, the wave of muscle activation progresses faster
than the wave of body bending, leading to an advancing phase of activation
relative to the curvature towards the tail. This is referred to as
""neuromechanical phase lags"" (NPL). Several multi-parameter neuromechanical
models have reproduced this phenomenon, but due to model complexity the origin
of the NPL has proved difficult to identify. Here we use perhaps the simplest
model of undulatory swimming to accurately predict the NPL during sand-swimming
by the sandfish lizard, with no fitting parameters. The sinusoidal wave used in
sandfish locomotion, the friction-dominated and non-inertial granular resistive
force environment, and the simplicity of the model allow detailed analysis, and
reveal the fundamental mechanism responsible for the phenomenon: the
combination of synchronized torques from distant points on the body and local
traveling torques. This general mechanism should help explain the NPL in
organisms in other environments; we therefore propose that sand-swimming could
be an excellent system to quantitatively generate and test other
neuromechanical models of movement. Such a system can also provide guidance for
the design and control of robotic undulatory locomotors in complex
environments.

associated with the mod $p$ (or mod $p^m$) cohomology of the locally symmetric
spaces for $\GL_n$ over a totally real or CM field, proving conjectures of Ash
and others. Following an old suggestion of Clozel, recently realized by
Harris-Lan-Taylor-Thorne for characteristic 0 cohomology classes, one realizes
the cohomology of the locally symmetric spaces for $\GL_n$ as a boundary
contribution of the cohomology of symplectic or unitary Shimura varieties, so
that the key problem is to understand torsion in the cohomology of Shimura
varieties.
  Thus, we prove new results on the $p$-adic geometry of Shimura varieties (of
Hodge type). Namely, the Shimura varieties become perfectoid when passing to
the inverse limit over all levels at $p$, and a new period map towards the flag
variety exists on them, called the Hodge-Tate period map. It is roughly
analogous to the embedding of the hermitian symmetric domain (which is roughly
the inverse limit over all levels of the complex points of the Shimura variety)
into its compact dual. The Hodge-Tate period map has several favorable
properties, the most important being that it commutes with the Hecke operators
away from $p$ (for the trivial action of these Hecke operators on the flag
variety), and that automorphic vector bundles come via pullback from the flag
variety.

be fitted with a simple quadratic function. Cathodic and anodic expansion data
collapses on one parabola when normalizing the surface charge by the ratio of

diffeomorphism. We will discuss how to define spectral invariants in the sense
of Viterbo and Oh by lifting the above function to a real-valued function on an
appropriate cyclic covering of $T^*\tilde M$ and using minimax-methods for
'half-infinite' chains. Furthermore we will define a 'Frobenius structure' on
$T^*\tilde M$ by letting elements of $T(T^*\tilde M)$ act on the fibres of a
line bundle $E$ on $T^*\tilde M$ spanned by 'coherent states' closely related
to the above spinor-matrix coefficient. The spectral Lagrangian in
$T^*(T^*\tilde M)$ associated to this Frobenius structure intersects the
zero-section $T^*\tilde M$ exactly at the critical points of the function
described beforehand.

several facets of this study, and differential privacy plays a role in more
than one way. Of course, it provides us a basis for modeling agent costs for
privacy, which is essential if we are to attempt mechanism design in a setting
in which agents have preferences for privacy. It also provides a toolkit for
controlling those costs. However, perhaps more surprisingly, it provides a
powerful toolkit for controlling the stability of mechanisms in general, which

quickest change detection in both continuous and discrete time setups. In this

whether there is a change in the statistical behavior of the observations. We
assume that the signals are independent and identically distributed across
sensors. An unknown subset of sensors are compromised and will send arbitrarily
modified and even artificially generated signals to the control center. It is
shown that the performance of the the so-called CUSUM statistic, which is
optimal when all sensors are honest, will be significantly degraded in the
presence of even a single dishonest sensor. In particular, instead of in a
logarithmically the detection delay grows linearly with the average run length
(ARL) to false alarm. To mitigate such a performance degradation, we propose a
fully distributed low complexity detection scheme. We show that the proposed
scheme can recover the log scaling. We also propose a centralized group-wise
scheme that can further reduce the detection delay.

within 30 days of discharge is important because such readmissions are not only
expensive but also critical indicator of provider care and quality of
treatment. Accurately predicting the risk-of-readmission may allow hospitals to
identify high-risk patients and eventually improve quality of care by
identifying factors that contribute to such readmissions in many scenarios. In
this paper, we investigate the problem of predicting risk-of-readmission as a
supervised learning problem, using a multi-layer classification approach.
Earlier contributions inadequately attempted to assess a risk value for 30 day
readmission by building a direct predictive model as opposed to our approach.
We first split the problem into various stages, (a) at risk in general (b) risk
within 60 days (c) risk within 30 days, and then build suitable classifiers for
each stage, thereby increasing the ability to accurately predict the risk using
multiple layers of decision. The advantage of our approach is that we can use
different classification models for the subtasks that are more suited for the
respective problems. Moreover, each of the subtasks can be solved using
different features and training data leading to a highly confident diagnosis or
risk compared to a one-shot single layer approach. An experimental evaluation
on actual hospital patient record data from Multicare Health Systems shows that
our model is significantly better at predicting risk-of-readmission of CHF
patients within 30 days after discharge compared to prior attempts.

cavity quantum electrodynamics, the dissipation of cavity fields is
characterized simply by the strengths of the two couplings: the light-matter
interaction and the system-environment coupling through the cavity mirror.
However, in the ultrastrong light-matter interaction regime, the dissipation
depends also on whether the two couplings are mediated by the electric field or
the magnetic one (capacitive or inductive in superconducting circuits). Even if
we know correctly the microscopic mechanism (Lagrangian) of the
system-environment coupling, the coupling Hamiltonian itself is in principle
modified due to the ultrastrong interaction in the cavity. In this paper, we
show a recipe for deriving a general expression of the Hamiltonian of the

the same input space. We propose an approach which is motivated by canonical
correlation analysis (CCA), a statistical technique which has proven successful
in a wide variety of pattern recognition problems. Like CCA when applied to the
matching of sets, our extended canonical correlation analysis (E-CCA) aims to
extract the most similar modes of variability within two sets. Our first major
contribution is the formulation of a principled framework for robust inference
of such modes from data in the presence of uncertainty associated with noise
and sampling randomness. E-CCA retains the efficiency and closed form
computability of CCA, but unlike it, does not possess free parameters which
cannot be inferred directly from data (inherent data dimensionality, and the
number of canonical correlations used for set similarity computation). Our
second major contribution is to show that in contrast to CCA, E-CCA is readily
adapted to match sets in a discriminative learning scheme which we call
discriminative extended canonical correlation analysis (DE-CCA). Theoretical
contributions of this paper are followed by an empirical evaluation of its
premises on the task of face recognition from sets of rasterized appearance
images. The results demonstrate that our approach, E-CCA, already outperforms
both CCA and its quasi-discriminative counterpart constrained CCA (C-CCA), for
all values of their free parameters. An even greater improvement is achieved
with the discriminative variant, DE-CCA.

presented as the two important metrics for investigating effect of dot size on
electron-hole interaction in CdSe quantum dots. Direct computation of
electron-hole recombination probability is challenging because it requires an
accurate mathematical description of electron-hole wavefunction in the
neighborhood of the electron-hole coalescence point. In this work, we address
this challenge by solving the electron-hole Schrodinger equation using the
electron-hole explicitly correlated Hartree-Fock (eh-XCHF) method. The
calculations were performed for a series of CdSe clusters ranging from
$\mathrm{Cd}_{20}\mathrm{Se}_{19}$ to $\mathrm{Cd}_{74608}\mathrm{Se}_{74837}$
that correspond to dot diameter range of 1-20 nm. The calculated exciton
binding energies and electron-hole recombination probabilities were found to
decrease with increasing dot size. Both of these quantities were found to scale
as $D_\mathrm{dot}^{-n}$ with respect to the dot diameter D. One of the key
insights from this study is that the electron-hole recombination probability
decreases at a much faster rate than the exciton binding energy as a function
of dot size. It was found that an increase in the dot size by a factor of 16.1,
resulted in a decrease in the exciton binding energy and electron-hole
recombination probability by a factor of 14.4 and $5.5\times10^{6}$,
respectively.

a closed system of two nonlinear PDEs of hydrodynamic type. This result
suggests that there must be a solution for all values of beta. We find the

Gene selection is a process to select genes which are more informative. It is
one of the important steps in knowledge discovery. The problem is that all
genes are not important in gene expression data. Some of the genes may be
redundant, and others may be irrelevant and noisy. In this study, the entire
dataset is divided in proper grouping of similar genes by applying Fuzzy C
Means (FCM) algorithm. A high class discriminated genes has been selected based
on their degree of dependence by applying Quick Reduct algorithm based on Rough
Set Theory to all the resultant clusters. Average Correlation Value (ACV) is
calculated for the high class discriminated genes. The clusters which have the
ACV value a s 1 is determined as significant clusters, whose classification
accuracy will be equal or high when comparing to the accuracy of the entire
dataset. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using WEKA classifiers and
compared. Finally, experimental results related to the leukemia cancer data
confirm that our approach is quite promising, though it surely requires further
research.

logistic regression, this is achieved by a simple novel stochastic gradient
algorithm that (a) constructs successive local quadratic approximations of the
loss functions, while (b) preserving the same running time complexity as
stochastic gradient descent. For these algorithms, we provide a non-asymptotic
analysis of the generalization error (in expectation, and also in high
probability for least-squares), and run extensive experiments on standard
machine learning benchmarks showing that they often outperform existing
approaches.

subjected to ecological changes and human impact. By using chloroplast
microsatellite markers (cpSSRs), we provide detailed phylogeographic
information and we address the contribution of natural and human-related
factors to the current pattern of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) variation. 626
individual trees from 86 oak stands including all three indigenous oak species
of the region were sampled. In order to verify the refugial origin, reference
samples from refugial areas and DNA samples from previous studies with known
cpDNA haplotypes (chlorotypes) were used. Chlorotypes belonging to three
different maternal lineages, corresponding to the three main glacial refugia,
were found in the area. These were spatially structured and highly introgressed
among species, reflecting past hybridization which involved all three
indigenous oak species. Site condition heterogeneity was found among groups of
populations which differed in terms of cpDNA variation. This suggests that
different biogeographic subregions within the Upper Rhine Valley were colonized
during separate post-glacial migration waves. Genetic variation was higher in
Quercus robur than in Quercus petraea, which is probably due to more efficient
seed dispersal and the more pronounced pioneer character of the former species.
Finally, stands of Q. robur established in the last 70 years were significantly
more diverse, which can be explained by the improved transportation ability of
seeds and seedlings for artificial regeneration of stands during this period.

between 1 Myr and 10 Gyr with the aim to reproduce the distributions of
rotational periods observed for star forming regions and young open clusters
within this age range. The models include a new wind braking law based on
recent numerical simulations of magnetized stellar winds and specific dynamo
and mass-loss prescriptions are adopted to tie angular momentum loss to angular
velocity. The model additionally assume constant angular velocity during the
disk accretion phase and allow for decoupling between the radiative core and
the convective envelope as soon as the former develops. We have developed
rotational evolution models for slow, median and fast rotators with initial
periods of 10, 7, and 1.4d, respectively. The models reproduce reasonably well
the rotational behaviour of solar-type stars between 1 Myr and 4.5 Gyr,
including PMS to ZAMS spin up, prompt ZAMS spin down, and the early-MS
convergence of surface rotation rates. We find the model parameters accounting
for the slow and median rotators are very similar to each other, with a disk
lifetime of 5 Myr and a core-envelope coupling timescale of 28-30 Myr. In
contrast, fast rotators have both shorter disk lifetime (2.5 Myr) and
core-envelope coupling timescale (12 Myr). We emphasize that these results are
highly dependent on the adopted braking law. We also report a tentative
correlation between initial rotational period and disk lifetime, which suggests
that protostellar spin-down by massive disks in the embedded phase is at the
origin of the initial dispersion of rotation rates in young stars. We conclude
that this class of semi-empirical models successfully grasp the main trends of
the rotational behaviour of solar-type stars as they evolve and make specific
predictions that may serve as a guide for further development.

signatures across the genome. Three interspecific pairs of natural populations
from three ecologically different regions, one in central Europe (SW Germany)
and two in the Balkan Peninsula (Greece and Bulgaria) were sampled. Grouping of
highly informative SSR loci was made according to the component of variation
they express - interspecific or provenance specific. Species and provenance
discriminant loci were characterized based on FSTs. Locus specific FSTs were
tested for deviation from the neutral expectation both within and between
species. Data were then treated separately in a Bayesian analysis of genetic
structure. By using three species discriminant loci, high membership
probability to inferred species groups was achieved. On the other hand,
analysis of genetic structure based on five provenance discriminant loci was
correlated with geographic region and revealed shared genetic variation between
neighbouring Q. petraea and Q. robur. Small sets of highly variable nuclear
SSRs were sufficient to discriminate, either between species or between
provenances. Thus, an effective tool is provided for molecular identification
of both species and provenances. Furthermore, data suggest that a combination
of gene flow and natural selection forms these diversity patterns. Species
discriminant loci might represent genome regions affected by directional
selection, which maintains species identity. Provenance specific loci might
represent genome regions with high interspecific gene flow and common adaptive
patterns to local environmental factors.

To find eigenfunctions and eigenvalues, we derive a differential equation which

achieved by the (k-1)st integral of x^{1-k/2}J_{k-2}(a_1\sqrt{x}), where a_1 is
the first positive root of the (k-2)nd Bessel function J_{k-2} and as such, is

eruption-related decreases and subsequent free-energy and helicity budgets that
are consistent with the observed eruption (flare and coronal-mass-ejection

with the recently proposed (free) energy - (relative) helicity diagram of solar
ARs, (2) eruption-related decreases occur {\it before} the flare and the
projected CME-launch times, suggesting that CME progenitors precede flares, and
(3) self-terms of free energy and relative helicity most likely originate from
respective mutual-terms, following a progressive mutual-to-self conversion

often simpler when restricted to models with bounded variability---where no
more than v events may occur every V time units, for given v, V. When reasoning
about formulas with intrinsic bounded variability, one can employ the simpler
techniques that rely on bounded variability, without any loss of generality.
What is then the complexity of algorithmically deciding which formulas have
intrinsic bounded variability?
  In this paper, we study the problem with reference to Metric Temporal Logic
(MTL). We prove that deciding bounded variability of MTL formulas is
undecidable over dense-time models, but with a undecidability degree lower than
generic dense-time MTL satisfiability. Over discrete-time models, instead,
deciding MTL bounded variability has the same exponential-space complexity as
satisfiability. To complement these negative results, we also briefly discuss
small fragments of MTL that are more amenable to reasoning about bounded
variability.

qualitatively different ways at first-order quantum phase transitions of the

even factorially fast closing of the energy gap, all of which coexist along a
single axis of the phase diagram representing the transverse field. This
variety emerges depending on whether or not the transverse field assumes a
rational number as well as on how the series of system size is chosen toward

chimeras on 1-d and 2-d lattices and random networks of discrete dynamical

damped systems. When the system network and external network are set in a
feedback loop, the system network can be controlled to a homogeneous steady
state or synchronized periodic state with suppression of the chaotic dynamics
of the individual units. The control scheme has the advantage that its design
does not require any prior information about the system dynamics or its
parameters and works effectively for a range of parameters of the control
network. We analyze the stability of the controlled steady state or amplitude
death state of lattices using the theory of circulant matrices and
Routh-Hurwitz's criterion for discrete systems and this helps to isolate
regions of effective control in the relevant parameter planes. The conditions
thus obtained are found to agree well with those obtained from direct numerical
simulations in the specific context of lattices with logistic map and Henon map
as on-site system dynamics. We show how chimera states developed in an
experimentally realizable 2-d lattice can be controlled using this scheme. We
propose this mechanism can provide a phenomenological model for the control of
spatio-temporal patterns in coupled neurons due to non-synaptic coupling with
the extra cellular medium. We extend the control scheme to regulate dynamics on

elucidate the approximations which underpin this model. We thereafter consider
the particular case of the CEFM in which the strength of the `local

ground state charges of this model can be expressed in terms of charge transfer
between all pairs of unlike atoms analogously to the linear charge model [R.
Magri et al., Phys. Rev. B 42, 11388 (1990)]. Hence the model considered is a
generalization of the linear charge model for alloys containing more than two

over a wide range of parameter space. These quantities are linked to the nature
of charge screening in the model, and we illustrate that the screening becomes
increasingly universal as the strength of the local interactions is increased.
We then use the model to derive analytical expressions for various physical
quantities, including the Madelung energy and the disorder broadening in the
core level binding energies. These expressions are applied to ternary random
alloys, for which it is shown that the Madelung energy and magnitude of

was introduced, then called $\pm$split. In the current \change{chapter} we
analyze this split further, interpret it geometrically as \change{an}
\emph{orthogonal 2D planes split} (OPS), and generalize it to a freely
steerable split of $\H$ into two orthogonal 2D analysis planes. The new general
form of the OPS split allows us to find new geometric interpretations for the
action of the QFT on the signal. The second major result of this work is a
variety of \emph{new steerable forms} of the QFT, their geometric
interpretation, and for each form\change{,} OPS split theorems, which allow
fast and efficient numerical implementation with standard FFT software.

transfer and loss, and species level events, such as speciation and extinction.
Gene tree-species tree reconciliation methods model these processes by drawing
gene trees into the species tree using a series of gene and species level
events. The reconstruction of gene trees based on sequence alone almost always
involves choosing between statistically equivalent or weakly distinguishable
relationships that could be much better resolved based on a putative species
tree. To exploit this potential for accurate reconstruction of gene trees the
space of reconciled gene trees must be explored according to a joint model of
sequence evolution and gene tree-species tree reconciliation.
  Here we present amalgamated likelihood estimation (ALE), a probabilistic
approach to exhaustively explore all reconciled gene trees that can be
amalgamated as a combination of clades observed in a sample of trees. We
implement ALE in the context of a reconciliation model, which allows for the
duplication, transfer and loss of genes. We use ALE to efficiently approximate
the sum of the joint likelihood over amalgamations and to find the reconciled
gene tree that maximizes the joint likelihood.
  We demonstrate using simulations that gene trees reconstructed using the
joint likelihood are substantially more accurate than those reconstructed using
sequence alone. Using realistic topologies, branch lengths and alignment sizes,
we demonstrate that ALE produces more accurate gene trees even if the model of
sequence evolution is greatly simplified. Finally, examining 1099 gene families
from 36 cyanobacterial genomes we find that joint likelihood-based inference
results in a striking reduction in apparent phylogenetic discord, with 24%, 59%
and 46% percent reductions in the mean numbers of duplications, transfers and
losses.

promising probe into the cosmic dark ages, cosmic dawn, and re-ionization.
LOFAR's Low Band Antennas (LBA) may be used in the frequency range 45 MHz to 85
MHz (30>z>16) to measure the sky averaged redshifted 21 cm brightness
temperature as a function of frequency, or equivalently, cosmic redshift. These
low frequencies are affected by strong Galactic foreground emission that is
observed through frequency dependent ionospheric and antenna beam distortions
which lead to chromatic mixing of spatial structure into spectral structure.
Using simple models, we show that (i) the additional antenna temperature due to
ionospheric refraction and absorption are at a \sim 1% level--- 2 to 3 orders
of magnitude higher than the expected 21 cm signal, and have an approximate
\nu^{-2} dependence, (ii) ionospheric refraction leads to a knee-like
modulation on the sky spectrum at \nu\approx 4\times plasma frequency. Using
more realistic simulations, we show that in the measured sky spectrum, more
than 50% of the 21 cm signal variance can be lost to confusion from foregrounds
and chromatic effects. We conclude that foregrounds and chromatic mixing may
not be subtracted as generic functions of frequency as previously thought, but
must rather be carefully modeled using additional priors and interferometric
measurements.

periodic photometric variability and can be useful proxies to detect
Differential Rotation (DR). DR is a major ingredient of the solar dynamo but
observations of stellar DR are rather sparse. In view of the Kepler space
telescope we are interested in the detection of DR using photometric
information of the star, and to develop a fast method to determine stellar DR
from photometric data. We ran a large Monte-Carlo simulation of differentially
rotating spotted stars with very different properties to investigate the
detectability of DR. For different noise levels the resulting light curves are
prewhitened using Lomb-Scargle periodograms to derive parameters for a global
sine fit to detect periodicities. We show under what conditions DR can
successfully be detected from photometric data, and in which cases the light
curve provides insufficient or even misleading information on the stellar
rotation law. In our simulations, the most significant period P1_{out} could be
detected in 96.2% of all light curves. Detection of a second period close to
P1_{out} is the signature of DR in our model. For the noise-free case, in 64.2%
of all stars such a period was found. Calculating the measured latitudinal
shear of two distinct spots \alpha_{out}, and comparing it to the known
original spot rotation rates shows that the real value is on average 3.2%
lower. Comparing the total equator-to-pole shear $\alpha$ to $\alpha_{out}$ we
find that $\alpha$ is underestimated by 8.8%, esp. the detection of DR for
stars with $\alpha$ < 6% is challenging. Finally, we apply our method to four
differentially rotating Kepler stars and find close agreement with results from
detailed modeling. Our method is capable of measuring stellar rotation periods
and detecting DR with relatively high accuracy and is suitable for large data
sets.

direction of the flow from one component to the other could possibly be
reversed. We aim to fit the observed eclipses into a scenario in which
reversals may occur. Orbital period changes can not be fitted into a unique
quadratic ephemeris, because of discontinuities in the (O-C) vs E graph. We try
to obtain better agreement through the allowance of RLOF reversal in this
binary system. From 1926 until 1943 the orbital period increase fits into a
model of mass transfer from the less massive component. From 1946 on the
direction of the mass transfer changed so that the most massive component
became the donor star, as shown by a systematic period decrease. A sudden
period increase in 1999 introduces a currently underway episode of mass
transfer from the less massive component. The ephemeris of VW Cep can be fitted
into a model in which the direction of the mass transfer was reversed twice

The well-known computational problem, called recognition, asks whether an input
graph $G$ can be represented by closed intervals, i.e., whether $G$ is an
interval graph. There are several linear-time algorithms known for recognizing
interval graphs, the oldest one is by Booth and Lueker [J. Comput. System Sci.,
13 (1976)] based on PQ-trees.
  In this paper, we study a generalization of recognition, called partial
representation extension. The input of this problem consists of a graph $G$
with a partial representation $\cal R'$ fixing the positions of some intervals.
The problem asks whether it is possible to place the remaining interval and
create an interval representation $\cal R$ of the entire graph $G$ extending
$\cal R'$. We generalize the characterization of interval graphs by Fulkerson
and Gross [Pac. J. Math., 15 (1965)] to extendible partial representations.
Using it, we give a linear-time algorithm for partial representation extension
based on a reordering problem of PQ-trees.

noisy observations $Z_i=X_i+\epsilon_i$, $i=1,...,n$, the goal is to design

respect to the Lebesgue measure. Since we observe a corrupted sample, a direct
approach as the popular {\it $k$-means} is not suitable in this case. In this
paper, we propose a noisy $k$-means minimization, which is based on the
$k$-means loss function and a deconvolution estimator of the density $f$. In
particular, this approach suffers from the dependence on a bandwidth involved
in the deconvolution kernel. Fast rates of convergence for the excess risk are
proposed for a particular choice of the bandwidth, which depends on the
smoothness of the density $f$.
  Then, we turn out into the main issue of the paper: the data-driven choice of
the bandwidth. We state an adaptive upper bound for a new selection rule,
called ERC (Empirical Risk Comparison). This selection rule is based on the
Lepski's principle, where empirical risks associated with different bandwidths
are compared. Finally, we illustrate that this adaptive rule can be used in
many statistical problems of $M$-estimation where the empirical risk depends on

power source: starburst or AGN. We obtained high spatial resolution
observations of NGC4418 at 1.4 and 5 GHz with MERLIN, and at 230 and 270 GHz
with the SMA very extended configuration. We use the continuum morphology and
flux density to estimate the size of the emitting region, the star formation
rate and the dust temperature. Emission lines are used to study the kinematics
through position-velocity diagrams. Molecular emission is studied with
population diagrams and by fitting an LTE synthetic spectrum. We detect bright
1mm line emission from CO, HC3N, HNC and C34S, and 1.4 GHz absorption from HI.
The CO 2-1 emission and HI absorption can be fit by two velocity components at
2090 and 2180 km s-1. We detect vibrationally excited HC3N and HNC, with Tvib
300K. Molecular excitation is consistent with a layered temperature structure,
with three main components at 80, 160 and 300 K. For the hot component we
estimate a source size of less than 5 pc. The nuclear molecular gas surface
density of 1e4 Msun pc-2 is extremely high, and similar to that found in the
ultra-luminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) Arp220. Our observations confirm the the
presence of a molecular and atomic in-flow, previously suggested by Herschel
observations, which is feeding the activity in the center of NGC4418. Molecular
excitation confirms the presence of a very compact, hot dusty core. If a
starburst is responsible for the observed IR flux, this has to be at least as
extreme as the one in Arp220, with an age of 3-10 Myr and a star formation rate
>10 Msun yr-1. If an AGN is present, it must be extremely Compton-thick.

based on the key features identified at the microscopic level, namely peri- ods
of elastic deformation interspersed with localised rearrangements of parti-
cles that induce long-range elastic deformation. These long-range deformations
are derived following a continuum mechanics approach, in the presence of solid
boundaries, and are included in full in the model. Indeed, they mediate spatial
cooperativity in the flow, whereby a localised rearrangement may lead a distant
region to yield. In particular, we simulate a channel flow and find
manifestations of spatial cooperativity that are consistent with published
experimental obser- vations for concentrated emulsions in microchannels. Two
categories of effects are distinguished. On the one hand, the coupling of
regions subject to different shear rates, for instance,leads to finite shear
rate fluctuations in the seemingly un- sheared ""plug"" in the centre of the
channel. On the other hand, there is convinc- ing experimental evidence of a
specific rheology near rough walls. We discuss diverse possible physical
origins for this effect, and we suggest that it may be associated with the
bumps of particles into surface asperities as they slide along the wall.

match the quality of the observations. Many current pulsation codes apply a
second order finite-difference scheme, combined with Richardson extrapolation
to reach fourth order accuracy on eigenfunctions. Although this is a simple and
robust approach, a number of drawbacks exist thus making fourth order schemes
desirable. A robust and simple finite-difference scheme, which can easily be
implemented in either 1D or 2D stellar pulsation codes is therefore required.
  Aims: One of the difficulties in setting up higher order finite-difference
schemes for stellar pulsations is the so-called mesh-drift instability. Current
ways of dealing with this defect include introducing artificial viscosity or
applying a staggered grids approach. However these remedies are not well-suited
to eigenvalue problems, especially those involving non-dissipative systems,
because they unduly change the spectrum of the operator, introduce
supplementary free parameters, or lead to complications when applying boundary
conditions.
  Methods: We propose here a new method, inspired from the staggered grids
strategy, which removes this instability while bypassing the above
difficulties. Furthermore, this approach lends itself to superconvergence, a
process in which the accuracy of the finite differences is boosted by one
order.
  Results: This new approach is shown to be accurate, flexible with respect to
the underlying grid, and able to remove mesh-drift.

distribution is non-monotonic in perpendicular velocity, the amplification
achieved by this instability is greater than bi-Maxwellian distributions for
typical anisotropies, because the waves can maintain resonance over a much
longer part of its trajectory. For ring speeds V_R close to the Alfven speed
V_A, the growth rate is maximum at parallel propagation but is much larger at
oblique angles compared with a bi-Maxwellian, and can have a second peak
approximately at kperp c/omegaPH V_R/V_A ~2.3 for ring speeds about the
parallel thermal speed. Strong wave gain is achieved for moderate ring speeds
V_R~V_A . The analysis suggests that EMIC wave activity should be closely
associated with equatorial noise.

solar nebula must have experienced a phase of large-scale outward transport of
small refractory grains as well as homogenization of initially spatially
heterogeneous short-lived isotopes. The stable oxygen isotopes, however, were
able to remain spatially heterogenous at the $\sim$ 6% level. One promising
mechanism for achieving these disparate goals is the mixing and transport
associated with a marginally gravitationally unstable (MGU) disk, a likely
cause of FU Orionis events in young low-mass stars. Several new sets of MGU
models are presented that explore mixing and transport in disks with varied
masses (0.016 to 0.13 $M_\odot$) around stars with varied masses (0.1 to 1
$M_\odot$) and varied initial $Q$ stability minima (1.8 to 3.1). The results
show that MGU disks are able to rapidly (within $\sim 10^4$ yr) achieve
large-scale transport and homogenization of initially spatially heterogeneous
distributions of disk grains or gas. In addition, the models show that while
single-shot injection heterogeneity is reduced to a relatively low level
($\sim$ 1%), as required for early solar system chronometry, continuous
injection of the sort associated with the generation of stable oxygen isotope
fractionations by UV photolysis leads to a sustained, relatively high level
($\sim$ 10%) of heterogeneity, in agreement with the oxygen isotope data. These
models support the suggestion that the protosun may have experienced at least
one FU Orionis-like outburst, which produced several of the signatures left
behind in primitive chondrites and comets.

  suggestions are welcome",,,,"math.DG math.GT math.RT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It was conjectured, twenty years ago, the following result that would
generalize the so-called rank rigidity theorem for homogeneous Euclidean
submanifolds: let M^n, n>=2, be a full and irreducible homogeneous submanifold
of the sphere $S^{N-1}\subset R^N$ and such that the normal holonomy group is
not transitive (on the unit sphere of the normal space to the sphere). Then M^n
must be an orbit of an irreducible s-representation (i.e. the isotropy
representation of a semisimple Riemannian symmetric space).
  If n=2, then the normal holonomy is always transitive, unless M is a
homogeneous isoparametric hypersurface of the sphere (and so the conjecture is
true in this case). We prove the conjecture when n=3. In this case M^3 must be
either isoparametric or a Veronese submanifold. The proof combines geometric
arguments with (delicate) topological arguments that uses information from two
different fibrations with the same total space (the holonomy tube and the
caustic fibrations).
  We also prove the conjecture for n>= 3 when the normal holonomy acts
irreducibly and the codimension is the maximal possible n(n+1)/2. This gives a
characterization of Veronese submanifolds in terms of normal holonomy. We also
extend this last result by replacing the homogeneity assumption by the
assumption of minimality (in the sphere).
  Another result of the paper, used for the case n=3, is that the number of
irreducible factors of the local normal holonomy group, for any Euclidean
submanifold M^n, is less or equal than [n/2] (which is the rank of the
orthogonal group SO(n)). This bound is sharp and improves the known bound
n(n-1)/2.

the left-right asymmetry in the reflection and transmission coefficients.
However, the non vanishing imaginary component of the potential near the

distance (the so-called Landau length) at which the interaction energy of two

induced by approaching charged particles increases their fluxes and reduces the
charging time scales. Furthermore, for grains of radius smaller than the Landau
length, the electric charge no longer decreases linearly with size, but has a
most probable equilibrium value close to one electron charge. We give
analytical results that can be used for nanograins in cold dense planetary
environments of the outer solar system. Application to the nanodust observed in
the plume of Saturn's moon Enceladus shows that most grains of radius about 1
nm should carry one electron, whereas an appreciable fraction of them are
positively charged by ion impacts. The corresponding electrostatic stresses
should destroy smaller grains, which anyway may not exist as crystals since
their number of molecules is close to the minimum required for crystallization.

further modularity-optimization methods and for methods based on different

the way to a determination of the mass hierarchy and of the CP-violating phase.
Experiments based on horn produced (anti-)neutrino conventional beams are
presently under development. The event rates are marginal for a definitive
search, since they require very intense beams and extremely large detector
masses. Zucchelli has proposed a method in which pure (anti-)nu_e beams are
generated by the beta-decay of relativistic radio-nuclides stored in a high
energy storage ring pointing towards a far away neutrino detector. Since they
have a much smaller transverse momentum distribution, the neutrino flux will be
much more narrowly concentrated than with a horn. The isomeric doublet Li-8
(anti-nu_e, tau_1/2=0.84s) and B-8 (nu_e, tau_1/2=0.77s) has been studied.
Neutrino and antineutrino beams are produced with an average transverse
momentum of about 6.5 MeV/c. Radioactive ions may be generated with a dedicated
table-top storage ring to supply a suitable ion source to be accelerated at
high energies either at FNAL or at CERN. Ions should then extracted from the
accelerator and accumulated in a decay storage ring with a long straight
section pointing toward the neutrino detector. A massive detector based on
liquid Argon technology is probably offering the best opportunities for such
future programme. The present ICARUS LAr-TPC experiment has already collected
at LNGS events in the relevant neutrino energy region. They should provide a
first evidence for a conclusive experimental study of the competing signals and
more generally for the actual feasibility of the beta-beam option in a search
of the CP violating phase. Additional data may be provided in the near future
with the ICARUS and MicroBooNe neutrino experiments located at a short distance
neutrino beam and that will collect a much larger number of neutrino events.

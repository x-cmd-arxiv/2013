with certain non-local operators is renormalizable. We consider one such model
which, at the linear perturbative level, reproduces the effective non-local
action for the light modes of bosonic closed string-field theory. Using the
property of asymptotic freedom in the ultraviolet and fixing the classical
behavior of the scale factor at late times, an algorithm is proposed to find
general homogeneous cosmological solutions valid both at early and late times.
Imposing a power-law classical limit, these solutions (including anisotropic
ones) display a bounce, instead of a big-bang singularity, and super-accelerate
near the bounce even in the absence of an inflaton or phantom field.

point-like atoms and molecules. Polymers can bend, twist, even become knotted.
Thus they may also display a much richer phase structure than point particles.
But it is not very easy to characterize the phase of a polymer. Essentially,
the only attribute is the radius of gyration. The way how it changes when the
degree of polymerization becomes different, and how it evolves when the ambient
temperature and solvent properties change, discloses the phase of the polymer.
Moreover, in any finite length chain there are corrections to scaling, that
complicate the detailed analysis of the phase structure. Here we introduce a
quantity that we call the folding angle, a novel tool to identify and
scrutinize the phases of polymers. We argue for a mean-field relationship
between its values and those of the scaling exponent in the radius of gyration.
But unlike in the case of the radius of gyration, the value of the folding
angle can be evaluated from a single structure. As an example we estimate the
value of the folding angle in the case of crystallographic {\alpha}-helical
protein structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). We also show how the value
can be numerically computed using a theoretical model of {\alpha}-helical
chiral homopolymers.

astrophysical plasmas. In addition to the presence of magnetic field, the
differences with neutral fluid isotropic turbulence are: weakness of
collisional dissipation and presence of several characteristic space and time
scales. In this paper we discuss observational properties of solar wind
turbulence in a large range from the MHD to the electron scales. At MHD scales,
within the inertial range, turbulence cascade of magnetic fluctuations develops
mostly in the plane perpendicular to the mean field. Solar wind turbulence is
compressible in nature. The spectrum of velocity fluctuations do not follow
magnetic field one. Probability distribution functions of different plasma
parameters are not Gaussian, indicating presence of intermittency. At the
moment there is no global model taking into account all these observed
properties of the inertial range. At ion scales, turbulent spectra have a
break, compressibility increases and the density fluctuation spectrum has a
local flattening. Around ion scales, magnetic spectra are variable and ion
instabilities occur as a function of the local plasma parameters. Between ion
and electron scales, a small scale turbulent cascade seems to be established.
Approaching electron scales, the fluctuations are no more self-similar: an
exponential cut-off is usually observed indicating an onset of dissipation. The
nature of the small scale cascade and a possible dissipation mechanism are
still under debate.

(MLC) hits the reliability break wall because of relatively high intrinsic bit
error rate (IBER). The chip maker companies offer two solutions to meet the
output bit error rate (OBER) specification: either partial coverage with error
correction code (ECC) or data storage in single level cell (SLC) with
significant increase of the die cost. The NOR flash memory allows to write
information in small portions, therefore the full error protection becomes
costly due to high required redundancy, e.g. $\sim$50%. This is very different
from the NAND flash memory writing at once large chunks of information; NAND
ECC requires just $\sim$10% redundancy. This paper gives an analysis of a novel
error protection scheme applicable to NOR storage of one byte. The method does
not require any redundant cells, but assumes 5th program level. The information
is mapped to states in the 4-dimensional space separated by the minimal
Manhattan distance equal 2. This code preserves the information capacity: one
byte occupies four memory cells. We demonstrate the OBER $\sim$ IBER$^{3/2}$
scaling law, where IBER is calculated for the 4-level MLC memory. As an
example, the 4-level MLC with IBER $\sim10^{-9}$, which is unacceptable for
high density products, can be converted to OBER $\sim10^{-12}$. We assume that
the IBER is determined by the exponentially distributed read noise. This is the
case for NOR Flash memory devices, since the exponential tails are typical for
the random telegraph signal (RTS) noise and for most of the charge loss, charge
gain, and charge sharing data losses.

improving computational efficiency of algorithms for matrix problems such as

  In this paper, we provide a simple yet effective framework to evaluate the
statistical properties of algorithmic leveraging in the context of estimating
parameters in a linear regression model with a fixed number of predictors. We
show that from the statistical perspective of bias and variance, neither
leverage-based sampling nor uniform sampling dominates the other. This result
is particularly striking, given the well-known result that, from the
algorithmic perspective of worst-case analysis, leverage-based sampling
provides uniformly superior worst-case algorithmic results, when compared with
uniform sampling. Based on these theoretical results, we propose and analyze
two new leveraging algorithms. A detailed empirical evaluation of existing
leverage-based methods as well as these two new methods is carried out on both

a good predictor of practical performance of existing and new leverage-based

analysis technique since its introduction over fifty years ago, and is now
commonly utilized within a family setting. Families of mixture models arise
when the component parameters, usually the component covariance (or scale)
matrices, are decomposed and a number of constraints are imposed. Within the
family setting, model selection involves choosing the member of the family,
i.e., the appropriate covariance structure, in addition to the number of
mixture components. To date, the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) has
proved most effective for model selection, and the expectation-maximization
(EM) algorithm is usually used for parameter estimation. In fact, this EM-BIC
rubric has virtually monopolized the literature on families of mixture models.
Deviating from this rubric, variational Bayes approximations are developed for
parameter estimation and the deviance information criterion for model
selection. The variational Bayes approach provides an alternate framework for
parameter estimation by constructing a tight lower bound on the complex
marginal likelihood and maximizing this lower bound by minimizing the
associated Kullback-Leibler divergence. This approach is taken on the most
commonly used family of Gaussian mixture models, and real and simulated data
are used to compare the new approach to the EM-BIC rubric.

separated representation to construct a surrogate of high-dimensional
stochastic functions, e.g., PDEs/ODEs, in order to decrease the computational
cost of Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations in Bayesian inference. The
surrogate model is constructed via a regularized alternative least-square
regression with Tikhonov regularization using a roughening matrix computing the
gradient of the solution, in conjunction with a perturbation-based error
indicator to detect optimal model complexities. The model approximates a vector
of a continuous solution at discrete values of a physical variable. The
required number of random realizations to achieve a successful approximation
linearly depends on the function dimensionality. The computational cost of the
model construction is quadratic in the number of random inputs, which
potentially tackles the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional stochastic
functions. Furthermore, this vector valued separated representation-based
model, in comparison to the available scalar-valued case, leads to a
significant reduction in the cost of approximation by an order of magnitude
equal to the vector size. The performance of the method is studied through its
application to three numerical examples including a 41-dimensional elliptic PDE

independent observable quantities and distance dependent ones. Although some
remarkable success has been achieved, the empirical correlations thus found are
still affected by a significant intrinsic scatter which downgrades the
precision in the inferred GRBs Hubble diagram. We investigate here whether this
scatter may come from fitting together objects belonging to intrinsically
different classes. To this end, we rely on a cladistics analysis to partition
GRBs in homogenous families according to their rest frame properties. Although
the poor statistics prevent us from drawing a definitive answer, we find that
both the intrinsic scatter and the coefficients of the $E_{peak}$\,-\,$E_{iso}$

subsample is fitted. It turns out that the fit to the full sample leads to a
scaling relation which approximately follows the diagonal of the region
delimited by the fits to each homogenous class. We therefore argue that a
preliminary identification of the class a GRB belongs to is necessary in order
to select the right scaling relation to be used in order to not bias the
distance determination and hence the Hubble diagram.

to understand the nature of their progenitors and the characteristics of the
explosions, investigation of proximate events are necessary. Here we present
the results of multi-wavelength observations of Type Ib SN 2007uy in the nearby
($\sim$ 29.5 Mpc) galaxy NGC 2770. Analysis of the photometric observations
revealed this explosion as an energetic event with peak absolute R band
magnitude $-18.5\pm0.16$, which is about one mag brighter than the mean value
($-17.6\pm0.6$) derived for well observed Type Ibc events. The SN is highly
extinguished, E(B-V) = 0.63$\pm$0.15 mag, mainly due to foreground material
present in the host galaxy. From optical light curve modeling we determine that
about 0.3 M$_{\odot}$ radioactive $^{56}$Ni is produced and roughly 4.4
M$_{\odot}$ material is ejected during this explosion with liberated energy
$\sim 15\times10^{51}$ erg, indicating the event to be an energetic one.
Through optical spectroscopy, we have noticed a clear aspheric evolution of
several line forming regions, but no dependency of asymmetry is seen on the
distribution of $^{56}$Ni inside the ejecta. The SN shock interaction with the
circumburst material is clearly noticeable in radio follow-up, presenting a
Synchrotron Self Absorption (SSA) dominated light curve with a contribution of
Free Free Absorption (FFA) during the early phases. Assuming a WR star, with
wind velocity $\ga 10^3 {\rm km s}^{-1}$, as a progenitor, we derive a lower
limit to the mass loss rate inferred from the radio data as $\dot{M} \ga
2.4\times10^{-5}$ M$_{\odot}$, yr$^{-1}$, which is consistent with the results
obtained for other Type Ibc SNe bright at radio frequencies.

upper limits are being set on these signals under the assumption that the
background radiation is isotropic. However, some level of anisotropy may be

carries important information. We show that the standard analysis for isotropic
backgrounds can be generalised in a conceptually straightforward way to the
case of generic anisotropic background radiation by decomposing the angular
distribution of the gravitational wave power on the sky into multipole moments.
We introduce the concept of generalised overlap reduction functions which
characterise the effect of the anisotropy multipoles on the correlation of the
timing residuals from the pulsars timed by a Pulsar Timing Array. In a search
for a signal characterised by a generic anisotropy, the generalised overlap
reduction functions play the role of the so-called Hellings and Downs curve

functions for a generic level of anisotropy and Pulsar Timing Array
configuration. We also provide an order of magnitude estimate of the level of

gravitational-wave (GW) background influencing pulsar signals. A stochastic
background of GWs from the incoherent superposition of many inspiraling
supermassive black hole binaries at nHz frequencies is likely to be the
dominant GW signal detectable by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). Even though one
might expect a background composed of a high-redshift cosmological population
of sources to be fairly isotropic, deviations from isotropy may be indicative
of local GW hotspots or some form of continuous anisotropy in the
angular-distribution of GW-power. A GWB induces time-of-arrival deviations in
pulsar signals which are correlated between separated pulsars. In an isotropic
background this cross-correlation follows a distinctive relationship, known as
the Hellings and Downs curve, that depends only on the angular separation of
the pulsars. If the background is anisotropic, the cross-correlation is
different, but predictable, and also depends on the absolute position of the
pulsars. By simulating datasets containing GWBs with various anisotropic
configurations, we have explored the prospects for constraining anisotropy
using near future data. We find that at moderate to high signal to noise ratio
the assumption of isotropy is no longer an appropriate description of the
simulated background. Furthermore, we can recover the nature of the injected
anisotropy in a Bayesian parameter-estimation search, and propose a prior on
the anisotropy search-space motivated by the physicality of the implied

transition metal phosphate compounds we use first-principles density functional
theory to calculate the contributions to the macroscopic monopolization from
the global distribution of magnetic moments within the unit cell, as well as
from the distribution of magnetization around the atomic sites. We find one
example within the series (LiMnPO$_4$) that shows a macroscopic monopolization
corresponding to a ferromonopolar ordering consistent with its diagonal
magnetoelectric response. The other members of the series (LiMPO$_4$, with M =
Co, Fe and Ni) have zero net monopolization but have antiferromonopolar
orderings that should lead to $q$-dependent diagonal magnetoelectric effects

divided into families of molecules. Our aim is to derive accurate physical
conditions and molecular abundances in the different components of Orion KL
from observed SO and SO2 lines. First we assumed LTE conditions obtain
rotational temperatures. We then used a radiative transfer model, assuming
either LVG or LTE excitation to derive column densities of these molecules in
the different components of Orion KL. We have detected 68 lines of SO, 34SO,
33SO, and S18O and 653 lines of SO2, 34SO2, 33SO2, SO18O and SO2 v2=1. We
provide column densities for all of them and also upper limits for the column
densities of S17O, 36SO, 34S18O, SO17O and 34SO2 v2=1 and for several
undetected sulfur-bearing species. In addition, we present 2'x2' maps around
Orion IRc2 of SO2 transitions with energies from 19 to 131 K and also maps with
four transitions of SO, 34SO and 34SO2. We observe an elongation of the gas
along the NE-SW direction. An unexpected emission peak appears at 20.5 km/s in
most lines of SO and SO2. A study of the spatial distribution of this emission
feature shows that it is a new component ~5"" in diameter, which lies ~4"" west
of IRc2. We suggest the emission from this feature is related to shocks
associated to the BN object. The highest column densities for SO and SO2 are
found in the high-velocity plateau (a region dominated by shocks) and in the
hot core. These values are up to three orders of magnitude higher than the
results for the ridge components. We also find high column densities for their
isotopologues in both components. Therefore, we conclude that SO and SO2 are
good tracers, not only of regions affected by shocks, but also of regions with
warm dense gas.

breaking de Sitter invariance. This is obscured by analytic continuation
techniques which produce formal solutions to the propagator equation that are
not propagators. Second, Morrison's de Sitter invariant solution for the spin
two sector of the graviton propagator involves derivatives of the scalar
propagator at $M^2 = 0$, where it is not meromorphic unless de Sitter breaking
is permitted. Third, de Sitter breaking does not require zero modes. Fourth,
the ambiguity Morrison claims in the equation for the spin two structure
function is fixed by requiring it to derive from a mode sum. Fifth, Morrison's
spin two sector is not ""physically equivalent"" to ours because their
coincidence limits differ. Finally, it is only the noninvariant propagator that
gets the time independence and scale invariance of the tensor power spectrum
correctly.

a non-interacting quantum field theory in which each bosonic mode with a given
frequency is equivalent to a sum of bosonic mode whose frequency is twice
($s$-times) as much, and a fermionic (parafermionic) mode with the same
frequency. Explicit formulas for the graded parafermionic partition functions
are obtained, and the inverse of the graded partition function (IGPPF), turns
out to be bosonic (fermionic) partition function depending on the parity of the
order $s$ of the parafermions. It is also shown that these partition functions
are generating functions of partitions of integers with restrictions. If the
parity of the order $s$ is even, then mixing a system of parafermions with a
system whose partition function is (IGPPF), results in a system of fermions and
bosons. On the other hand, if the parity of $s$ is odd, then, the system we
obtain is still a mixture of fermions and bosons but the corresponding Fock
space of states is truncated. It turns out that these partition functions are
given in terms of the Jacobi theta function $\theta_{4}$, and generate
sequences in partition theory. Our partition functions coincide with the
overpartitions, and jagged partitions in conformal field theory. Also, The
partition functions obtained are related to the Ramond characters of the
superconformal minimal models, and in the counting of the Moore-Read edge
spectra that appear in the fractional quantum Hall effect. The different
partition functions for the Riemann gas that are the counter parts of the Euler
gas are obtained by a simple change of variables. In particular the counter
part of the Jacobi Theta function is $\frac{\zeta(2t)}{\zeta(t)^2}$.

For the main examples of Grassmannians of type A and maximal orthogonal

observables defined using the k_t, CA and SISCone algorithms. We specifically
choose the jet mass distribution as an example and calculate up to
order(alpha_s^4) clustering-log terms in the series expansion at single-log
accuracy. These terms are found to exhibit a pattern of exponentiation and we
are thus able to perform an all-orders analytical resummation for the
clustering logs. We also numerically calculate the non-global logs at large
N_c. We show that our result for the resummation of clustering logs is a very
good analytical approximation to the numerical result obtained using a
specialised Monte Carlo program.

stored in a single \textsuperscript{87}Rb atom in an optical dipole trap by
using Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill(CPMG) pulse sequences. Regarded as a repetition
of spin echo, CPMG sequence is an optimal choice for suppressing both
inhomogeneous and homogeneous phase decoherence mechanisms. In the trap with
830 nm wavelength and 0.7 mK potential depth, the spin relaxation time of
single atoms is showed to be 830.8 ms. We obtain the reversible inhomogeneous
dephasing time of $T_{2}^{\ast}$=1.4 ms. The homogeneous dephasing time is
$T_{2}^{\prime}$ =102.7 ms in the spin echo process, by employing CPMG sequence
with pulse number n = 6 the homogeneous dephasing is further suppressed by a
factor of 3, and its corresponding coherence time is extended to
$T_{2}^{\prime}$=304.5 ms.

evaluation from the perspective of parameterized complexity. We classify sets
of boolean conjunctive queries according to the complexity of this problem.
Previous work showed that a set of conjunctive queries is fixed-parameter
tractable precisely when the set is equivalent to a set of queries having
bounded treewidth. We present a fine classification of query sets up to
parameterized logarithmic space reduction. We show that, in the bounded
treewidth regime, there are three complexity degrees and that the properties
that determine the degree of a query set are bounded pathwidth and bounded tree
depth. We also engage in a study of the two higher degrees via logarithmic
space machine characterizations and complete problems. Our work yields a
significantly richer perspective on the complexity of conjunctive queries and,
at the same time, suggests new avenues of research in parameterized complexity.

dense matter composed of light mesons and baryons, such as it is formed in
heavy-ion collisions. We use a unitarized approach based on effective models
for the interaction of a D meson with hadrons, which are compatible with chiral
and heavy quark symmetries. We study the propagation of the D meson in the
hadron matter in two distinct cases. On the one hand, we analyze the
propagation of D mesons in matter at vanishing baryochemical potential, which
is relevant for high-energetic collisions at LHC or RHIC. On the other hand, we
show the propagation of D mesons in the hadronic medium following isentropic
trajectories, appropiate at FAIR and NICA heavy-ion experiments. We find a
negligible baryon contribution to the transport coefficients at vanishing
chemical potential. However at finite baryochemical potential we obtain a large
correction to the transport coefficients with the inclusion of nucleons and
Delta baryons. The relaxation time for D mesons is reduced a factor 2-3 in the
later case, producing a more thermalized D meson-spectrum for FAIR physics than
for the typical LHC energies. We finally present results for the spatial
diffusion coefficient of a D meson in hadronic matter and the possible
existence of a minimum near the phase transition to the quark-gluon plasma at
zero and finite baryochemical potential.

  text overlap with arXiv:1009.0676",,,,"math.AG math.QA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Drinfeld zastava is a certain closure of the moduli space of maps from the
projective line to the Kashiwara flag scheme of an affine Lie algebra $\hat g$.
In case $g$ is the symplectic Lie algebra $sp_N$, we introduce an affine,
reduced, irreducible, normal quiver variety $Z$ which maps to the zastava space
isomorphically in characteristic 0. The natural Poisson structure on the
zastava space $Z$ can be described in terms of Hamiltonian reduction of a
certain Poisson subvariety of the dual space of a (nonsemisimple) Lie algebra.
The quantum Hamiltonian reduction of the corresponding quotient of its
universal enveloping algebra produces a quantization $Y$ of the coordinate ring
of $Z$. The same quantization was obtained in the finite (as opposed to the
affine) case generically in arXiv:math/0409031 . We prove that $Y$ is a
quotient of the affine Borel Yangian. The analogous results for $g=sl_N$ were
obtained in our previous work arXiv:1009.0676 .

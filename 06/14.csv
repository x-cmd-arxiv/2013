Region (PDR) surrounding the Ultra-Compact (UC) HII region W48A. Our modelling
shows that the inner regions ($A_V \sim 1$) of the CII layer in the PDR
contribute significantly to the CRL emission. The dependence of line ratios of
CRL emission with the density of the PDR and the far ultra-violet (FUV)
radiation incident on the region is explored over a large range of these
parameters that are typical for the environments of UCHII regions. We find that
by observing a suitable set of CRLs it is possible to constrain the density of
the PDR. If the neutral density in the PDR is high ($\gtrsim 10^7$ \cmthree)
CRL emission is bright at high frequencies ($\gtrsim 20$ GHz), and absorption
lines from such regions can be detected at low frequencies ($\lesssim 10$ GHz).
Modelling CRL observations towards W48A shows that the UCHII region is embedded
in a molecular cloud of density of about $4 \times$ 10$^7$ \cmthree.

CHSH nonlocality. This also provides a different perspective on the
relationship between entanglement and nonlocality through the dual picture of
quantum channels instead of through states. For a channel to be entanglement
breaking it is sufficient to `break' the entanglement of maximally entangled

restricted class of states for all channels this holds.We also consider
channels whose output remains local under SLOCC and call them `strongly
non-locality breaking'.
  We provide a closed form necessary-sufficient condition for any two-qubit
state to show hidden CHSH nonlocality, which is likely to be useful for other
purposes as well. This in turn allows us to characterize all strongly
non-locality breaking qubit channels. It turns out that unital qubit channels

also used to construct a model for the cloud to examine the effect of
temperature gradients on the estimated optical depths and dust absorption
cross-sections. A linear correlation is seen between the colour H-Ks and tauFIR
up to high extinctions (AV ~ 25). The correlation translates to the average
extinction ratio A250um/AJ = 0.0014 +/- 0.0002, assuming a standard
near-infrared extinction law and a dust emissivity index beta=2. Using an
empirical NH/AJ ratio we obtain an average absorption cross-section per H
nucleus of sigmaH(250um) = (1.8 +/- 0.3) * 10^(-25) cm^2 / H-atom,
corresponding to a cross-section per unit mass of gas kappaG(250 um) = 0.08 +/-
0.01 cm^2 / g. The cloud model however suggests that owing to the bias caused
by temperature changes along the line-of-sight these values underestimate the
true cross-sections by up to 40% near the centre of the core. Assuming that the
model describes the effect of the temperature variation on tauFIR correctly, we
find that the relationship between H-Ks and tauFIR agrees with the recently
determined relationship between sigmaH and NH in Orion A. The derived far-IR
cross-section agrees with previous determinations in molecular clouds with
moderate column densities, and is not particularly large compared with some
other cold cores. We suggest that this is connected to the core not beng very
dense (the central density is likely to be ~10^5 cm^-3) and judging from

binary star system (TYC 3010-1494-1), comprising two solar-type stars that we
had initially identified as a single star with a brown dwarf companion. At the
moderate resolving power of the MARVELS spectrograph and the spectrographs used
for subsequent radial-velocity (RV) measurements (R ~ <30,000), this particular
stellar binary mimics a single-lined binary with an RV signal that would be
induced by a brown dwarf companion (Msin(i)~50 M_Jup) to a solar-type primary.
At least three properties of this system allow it to masquerade as a single
star with a very low-mass companion: its large eccentricity (e~0.8), its
relatively long period (P~238 days), and the approximately perpendicular
orientation of the semi-major axis with respect to the line of sight (omega~189
degrees). As a result of these properties, for ~95% of the orbit the two sets
of stellar spectral lines are completely blended, and the RV measurements based
on centroiding on the apparently single-lined spectrum is very well fit by an
orbit solution indicative of a brown dwarf companion on a more circular orbit
(e~0.3). Only during the ~5% of the orbit near periastron passage does the
true, double-lined nature and large RV amplitude of ~15 km/s reveal itself. The
discovery of this binary system is an important lesson for RV surveys searching
for substellar companions; at a given resolution and observing cadence, a
survey will be susceptible to these kinds of astrophysical false positives for
a range of orbital parameters. Finally, for surveys like MARVELS that lack the
resolution for a useful line bisector analysis, it is imperative to monitor the
peak of the cross-correlation function for suspicious changes in width or
shape, so that such false positives can be flagged during the candidate vetting
process.

Stokes-Einstein relation, each instance of the diffusive mixing process

per particle than standard discretization approaches. More complicated or more
highly resolved particle shapes can be built out of a collection of reactive
blobs. We demonstrate numerically that the blob model can provide an accurate
representation at low to moderate packing densities of the reactive particles,
at a cost not much larger than solving a Poisson equation in the same domain.
Unlike multipole expansion methods, our method does not require
analytically-computed Green's functions, but rather, computes regularized
discrete Green's functions on the fly by using a standard grid-based
discretization of the Poisson equation. This allows for great flexibility in
implementing different boundary conditions, coupling to fluid flow or thermal
transport, and the inclusion of other effects such as temporal evolution and
even nonlinearities. We develop multigrid-based preconditioners for solving the
linear systems that arise when using implicit temporal discretizations or
studying steady states. In the diffusion-limited case the resulting linear
system is a saddle-point problem, the efficient solution of which remains a
challenge for suspensions of many particles. We validate our method by
comparing to published results on reaction-diffusion in ordered and disordered
suspensions of reactive spheres.

essentially operate outside the BitTorrent incentives, with two caveats: slow
downlinks lead to increased numbers of ""temporary"" seeders (who left their
console, but will terminate their seeder role when they return), and the
copyright liability boon that file segmentation offers for permanent seeders.
Using a simple epidemic model for a two-segment BitTorrent swarm, we focus on
the BitTorrent rule to disseminate the (locally) rarest segments first. With
our model, we show that the rarest-segment first rule minimizes transition time
to seeder (complete file acquisition) and equalizes the segment populations in
steady-state. We discuss how alternative dissemination rules may {\em
beneficially increase} file acquisition times causing leechers to remain in the
system longer (particularly as temporary seeders). The result is that leechers
are further enticed to cooperate. This eliminates the threat of extinction of
rare segments which is prevented by the needed presence of permanent seeders.
Our model allows us to study the corresponding trade-offs between performance
improvement, load on permanent seeders, and content availability, which we
leave for future work. Finally, interpreting the two-segment model as one
involving a rare segment and a ""lumped"" segment representing the rest, we study
a model that jointly considers control of rare segments and different uplinks

properties of clusters and their total mass is key to realizing their potential
as cosmological probes. In this study, we investigate whether the evolution of
cluster scaling relations is affected by the spurious evolution of mass caused
by the evolving reference density with respect to which halo masses are defined
(pseudo-evolution). We use the relation between mass, M, and velocity
dispersion, sigma, as a test case, and show that the deviation from the M-sigma
relation of cluster-sized halos caused by pseudo-evolution is smaller than 10%
for a wide range of mass definitions. The reason for this small impact is a
tight relation between the velocity dispersion and mass profiles, sigma(<r) =
const * (GM(<r) / r)^1/2, which holds across a wide range of radii. We show
that such a relation is generically expected for a variety of density profiles,
as long as halos are in approximate Jeans equilibrium. Thus, as the outer
""virial"" radius used to define the halo mass, R, increases due to
pseudo-evolution, halos approximately preserve their M-sigma relation. This
result highlights the fact that tight scaling relations are the result of tight
equilibrium relations between radial profiles of physical quantities. We find
exceptions at very small and very large radii, where the profiles deviate from
the relations they exhibit at intermediate radii. We discuss the implications
of these results for other cluster scaling relations, and argue that
pseudo-evolution should have a small effect on most scaling relations, except
for those that involve the stellar masses of galaxies. In particular, we show
that the relation between stellar-mass fraction and total mass is affected by
pseudo-evolution and is largely shaped by it for halo masses of less than 10^14
solar masses.

frameworks the concept of Steepest Entropy Ascent dynamics introduced by the
present author in previous work on quantum thermodynamics. Actually, the
present formulation constitutes a generalization also in the quantum
thermodynamics framework. The analysis emphasizes that in the SEA-inspired
implementation of the MEP principle, a key role is played by the geometrical
metric with respect to which to measure the length of a trajectory in state
space. The metric tensor turns out to be directly related to the inverse of the
Onsager's generalized conductivity tensor. We conclude that in most of the
existing theories of non-equilibrium the time evolution of the state
representative can be seen to actually follow in state space the path of SEA
with respect to a suitable metric connected with the generalized
conductivities. The resulting unified family of SAE/MEP dynamical models are
all intrinsically consistent with the second law of thermodynamics. The
nonnegativity of the entropy production is a general and readily proved feature
of SEA dynamics. In several of the different approaches to non-equilibrium
description we consider here, the SEA concept has not been investigated before.
Therefore, it is hoped that the present unifying approach may prove useful in
providing a fresh basis for effective, thermodynamically consistent, numerical
models and theoretical treatments of irreversible conservative relaxation
towards equilibrium from far non-equilibrium states.

the fluctuations around the scaling laws are log-normally distributed, which
enabled us to model these scaling laws by a stochastic-like equation driven by
a multiplicative and log-normally distributed noise. Because of the scaling
laws, we argue that it is better to employ logarithms in order to describe the
number of homicides in function of the urban metrics via regression analysis.
In addition to the regression analysis, we propose an approach to correlate
crime and urban metrics via the evaluation of the distance between the actual
value of the number of homicides (as well as the value of the urban metrics)
and the value that is expected by the scaling law with the population size.
This approach have proved to be robust and useful for unveiling
relationships/behaviors that were not properly carried out by the regression
analysis, such as i) the non-explanatory potential of the elderly population
when the number of homicides is much above or much below the scaling law, ii)
the fact that unemployment has explanatory potential only when the number of
homicides is considerably larger than the expected by the power law, and iii) a
gender difference in number of homicides, where cities with female population
below the scaling law are characterized by a number of homicides above the
power law.

part to classify irreducible admissible representations with wild ramification.
An important observation was that minimal K-types associated to such
representations correspond to fundamental strata. These latter objects are
triples (x, r, beta), where x is a point in the Bruhat-Tits building of the
reductive group G, r is a nonnegative real number, and beta is a semistable
functional on the degree r associated graded piece of the Moy-Prasad filtration
corresponding to x.
  Recent work on the wild ramification case of the geometric Langlands
conjectures suggests that fundamental strata also play a role in the geometric
setting. In this paper, we develop a theory of minimal K-types for formal flat
G-bundles. We show that any formal flat G-bundle contains a fundamental
stratum; moreover, all such strata have the same rational depth. We thus obtain
a new invariant of a flat G-bundle called the slope, generalizing the classical
definition for flat connections. The slope can also be realized as the minimum
depth of a stratum contained in the flat G-bundle, and in the case of positive
slope, all such minimal depth strata are fundamental. Finally, we show that a
flat G-bundle is irregular singular if and only if it has positive slope.

are only interested in, a study area that is temporally or spatially bounded.
In the geosciences we may be interested in spectrally modeling a time series

be facilitated if a basis of functions can be found that are ""spatiospectrally""
concentrated, i.e. ""localized"" in both domains at the same time. Here, we give
a theoretical overview of one particular approach to this ""concentration""

scheme, thus confirming the validity and universality of the long-time cumulant

in large volumes, to a continuous-index Virasoro algebra for which we develop

concentrated, or, alternatively, spacelimited and spectrally concentrated,
suitable for the analysis and representation of real-valued vector fields on
the surface of the unit sphere, as arises in the natural and biomedical
sciences, and engineering. Building on the original approach of Slepian,
Landau, and Pollak we concentrate the energy of our function bases into
arbitrarily shaped regions of interest on the sphere, and within certain
bandlimits in the vector spherical-harmonic domain. As with the concentration
problem for scalar functions on the sphere, which has been treated in detail
elsewhere, a Slepian vector basis can be constructed by solving a
finite-dimensional algebraic eigenvalue problem. The eigenvalue problem
decouples into separate problems for the radial and tangential components. For
regions with advanced symmetry such as polar caps, the spectral concentration
kernel matrix is very easily calculated and block-diagonal, lending itself to
efficient diagonalization. The number of spatiospectrally well-concentrated
vector fields is well estimated by a Shannon number that only depends on the
area of the target region and the maximal spherical-harmonic degree or
bandwidth. The spherical Slepian vector basis is doubly orthogonal, both over
the entire sphere and over the geographic target region. Like its scalar
counterparts it should be a powerful tool in the inversion, approximation and
extension of bandlimited fields on the sphere: vector fields such as gravity
and magnetism in the earth and planetary sciences, or electromagnetic fields in
optics, antenna theory and medical imaging.

6333 (M9). The technique of difference image analysis has been used, which
enables photometric precision better than 0.05 mag for stars brighter than $V
\sim 19.0$ mag, even in the crowded central regions of the cluster. The high
photometric precision has resulted in the discovery of two new RRc stars, three
eclipsing binaries, seven long-term variables and one field RRab star behind
the cluster. A detailed identification chart and equatorial coordinates are
given for all the variable stars in the field of our images of the cluster. Our
data together with literature $V$-data obtained in 1994 and 1995 allowed us to
refine considerably the periods for all RR Lyrae stars. The nature of the new
variables is discussed. We argue that variable V12 is a cluster member and an
Anomalous Cepheid. Secular period variations, double mode pulsations and/or the
Blazhko-like modulations in some RRc variables are addressed. Through the light
curve Fourier decomposition of 12 RR Lyrae stars we have calculated a mean
metallicity of [Fe/H]$_{\rm ZW}$=$-1.70 \pm 0.01{\rm(statistical)} \pm
0.14{\rm(systematic)}$ or [Fe/H]$_{UVES}=-1.67 \pm 0.01{\rm(statistical)} \pm
0.19{\rm(systematic)}$.Absolute magnitudes, radii and masses are also estimated
for the RR Lyrae stars.
  A detailed search for SX Phe stars in the Blue Straggler region was conducted
but none were discovered. If SX Phe exist in the cluster then their amplitudes
must be smaller than the detection limit of our photometry.
  The CMD has been corrected for heavy differential reddening using the
detailed extinction map of the cluster of Alonso-Garc\'ia et al. (2012). This
has allowed us to set the mean cluster distance from two independent estimates;
from the RRab and RRc absolute magnitudes, we find $8.04\pm 0.19$ kpc and
$7.88\pm0.30$ kpc respectively.

developments in the foundations of quantum mechanics concerning the nature of
the wavefunction within the scope of more logical and structural methods. A
first step involves generalising and reformulating a criterion for the reality
of the wavefunction proposed by Harrigan & Spekkens, which was central to the
PBR theorem. The resulting criterion has several advantages, including the
avoidance of certain technical difficulties relating to sets of measure zero.
By considering the 'reality' not of the wavefunction but of the observable
properties of any ontological physical theory a novel characterisation of
non-locality and contextuality is found.
  Secondly, a careful analysis of preparation independence, one of the key
assumptions of the PBR theorem, leads to an analogy with Bell locality, and
thence to a proposal to weaken it to an assumption of
`no-preparation-signalling' in analogy with no-signalling. This amounts to
introducing non-local correlations in the joint ontic state, which is, at
least, consistent with the Bell and Kochen-Specker theorems. The question of
whether the PBR result can be strengthened to hold under this relaxed
assumption is therefore posed.

extragalactic surveys. Recent studies have reported relatively weak
correlations between observed AGN luminosities and the properties of AGN hosts,
which has been interpreted to imply that there is no direct connection between
AGN activity and star formation. However, AGNs may be expected to vary
significantly on a wide range of timescales (from hours to Myr) that are far
shorter than the typical timescale for star formation (>~100 Myr). This
variability can have important consequences for observed correlations. We
present a simple model in which all star-forming galaxies host an AGN when
averaged over ~100 Myr timescales, with long-term average AGN accretion rates
that are perfectly correlated with the star formation rate (SFR). We show that
reasonable prescriptions for AGN variability reproduce the observed weak
correlations between SFR and L_AGN in typical AGN host galaxies, as well as the
general trends in the observed AGN luminosity functions, merger fractions, and
measurements of the average AGN luminosity as a function of SFR. These results
imply there may be a tight connection between AGN activity and SFR over galaxy
evolution timescales, and that the apparent similarities in rest-frame colors,
merger rates, and clustering of AGNs compared to ""inactive"" galaxies may be due
primarily to AGN variability. The results provide motivation for future deep,
wide extragalactic surveys that can measure the distribution of AGN accretion
rates as a function of SFR.

simulations using the {\tt ECOSMOG} code. Our simulations include the
Vainshtein screening effect, which reconciles the Cubic Galileon model with
local tests of gravity. In the linear regime, the amplitude of the matter power
spectrum increases by $\sim 25%$ with respect to the standard $\Lambda$CDM
model today. The modified expansion rate accounts for $\sim 20%$ of this
enhancement, while the fifth force is responsible for only $\sim 5%$. This is
because the effective unscreened gravitational strength deviates from standard
gravity only at late times, even though it can be twice as large today. In the
nonlinear regime ($k \gtrsim 0.1 h\rm{Mpc}^{-1}$), the fifth force leads to
only a modest increase ($\lesssim 8%$) in the clustering power on all scales
due to the very efficient operation of the Vainshtein mechanism. Such a strong
effect is typically not seen in other models with the same screening mechanism.
The screening also results in the fifth force increasing the number density of
halos by less than 10%, on all mass scales. Our results show that the screening
does not ruin the validity of linear theory on large scales which anticipates
very strong constraints from galaxy clustering data. We also show that, whilst
the model gives an excellent match to CMB data on small angular scales ($l
\gtrsim 50$), the predicted integrated Sachs-Wolf effect is in tension with
Planck/WMAP results.

obvious with no Solar System analog to draw upon and there exists some
ambiguity as to whether a given candidate is a rocky Super-Earth or a

the sheer number of candidates in this size-range, there is evidently a need

assume and exploit the boundary condition that the bulk composition of a
solid/liquid Super-Earth cannot be composed of a material lighter than that of
water. Mass-radius loci above a pure-water composition planet correspond to
R_MAH>0. The statistical confidence of a planet maintaining an extended
atmosphere can be therefore easily calculated to provide a simple ranking of
target planets for follow-up observations. We also discuss how this metric can
be useful in the interpretation of the spectra of observed planetary

to 30AU and 100AU in a minimum mass solar nebula (MMSN) disk model, which
consists of a far-UV-ionized surface layer and low-ionization disk interior.
These simulations serve as a follow up to Simon et al. (2013), in which we
found that without a net vertical field, the turbulent stresses that result
from the magnetorotational instability (MRI) are too weak to account for
observed accretion rates. The simulations in this work show a very strong
dependence of the accretion stresses on the strength of the background vertical
field; as the field strength increases, the stress amplitude increases. For gas
to magnetic pressure ratios of 1e4 and 1e5, we find accretion rates between
1e-8 and 1e-7 solar masses per year. These accretion rates agree with
observational constraints, suggesting a vertical magnetic field strength
between 60 and 200 microgauss at 30AU and 10 and 30 microgauss at 100AU in a
MMSN disk. Furthermore, the stress has a non-negligible component due to a
magnetic wind. For sufficiently strong vertical field strengths, MRI turbulence
is quenched, and the flow becomes largely laminar, with accretion proceeding
through large scale correlations in the radial and toroidal field components as
well as through the magnetic wind. In all simulations, the presence of a low
ionization region near the disk mid-plane, which we call the ambipolar damping
zone, results in reduced stresses there.

KAT-7 is the precursor of the SKA pathfinder MeerKAT, which is under

make it sensitive to large scale low surface brightness emission. The new
observations with KAT-7 allow the measurement of the rotation curve of NGC 3109

can reproduce very well the observed rotation curve but the cosmologically

accurate gas distribution has reduced the discrepancy between the observed RC
and the MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) models, this is done at the expense
of having to use unrealistic mass-to-light ratios for the stellar disk and/or
very large values for the MOND universal constant a0. Different distances or HI
contents cannot reconcile MOND with the observed kinematics, in view of the
small errors on those two quantities. As for many slowly rotating gas-rich
galaxies studied recently, the present result for NGC 3109 continues to pose a

duality-invariant values \tau=i and \tau=exp(i\pi/3). For low-rank gauge
groups, the predictions are compatible with the bounds derived by conformal
bootstrap methods for these anomalous dimensions; within numerical errors, they
are in good agreement with the conjecture that said bounds are saturated at a

they are up to a factor two older than the ages typically adopted in the

circumstellar discs survive longer (~10-12 Myr) and that the average Class I
lifetime is greater (~1 Myr) than currently believed.
  For each star-forming region we derived two ages from colour-magnitude
diagrams. First we fitted models of the evolution between the zero-age
main-sequence and terminal-age main-sequence to derive a homogeneous set of
main-sequence ages, distances and reddenings with statistically meaningful
uncertainties. Our second age for each star-forming region was derived by
fitting pre-main-sequence stars to new semi-empirical model isochrones. For the
first time (for a set of clusters younger than 50 Myr) we find broad agreement
between these two ages, and since these are derived from two distinct mass
regimes that rely on different aspects of stellar physics, it gives us
confidence in the new age scale. This agreement is largely due to our adoption
of empirical colour-Teff relations and bolometric corrections for
pre-main-sequence stars cooler than 4000 K.

connection in the construction of (a symmetry-reduced version of) loop quantum
gravity. We start with the four-dimensional Lorentzian Holst action that we
reduce to three dimensions in a way that preserves the presence of $\gamma$. In
the time gauge, the phase space of the resulting three-dimensional theory
mimics exactly that of the four-dimensional one. Its quantization can be
performed, and on the kinematical Hilbert space spanned by SU(2) spin network
states the spectra of geometric operators are discrete and $\gamma$-dependent.
However, because of the three-dimensional nature of the theory, its SU(2)
Ashtekar-Barbero Hamiltonian constraint can be traded for the flatness
constraint of an sl(2,C) connection, and we show that this latter has to
satisfy a linear simplicity-like condition analogous to the one used in the
construction of spin foam models. The physically relevant solution to this
constraint singles out the non-compact subgroup SU(1,1), which in turn leads to
the disappearance of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter and to a continuous length
spectrum, in agreement with what is expected from Lorentzian three-dimensional
gravity.

possibility of isospin violation and inelasticity in interactions. We find that
these experiments are best able to discriminate dark matter properties for dark

the use of two targets gives only a small improvement (aside from the advantage
of different systematics associated with any claimed signal) in the ability to

novel possibility in the presence of interactions, a surface phase that
preserves all symmetries but is nevertheless gapped and insulating. Then the
surface must develop topological order of a kind that cannot be realized in a
2D system with the same symmetries. We discuss candidate surface states -
non-Abelian Quantum Hall states which, when realized in 2D, have
$\sigma_{xy}=1/2$ and hence break $\mathcal T$ symmetry. However, by
constructing an exactly soluble 3D lattice model, we show they can be realized

confined, and have $\theta=\pi$ magnetoelectric response. Two candidate states
have the same 12 particle topological order, the (Read-Moore) Pfaffian state

but differ in their $\mathcal T$ transformation. Although we are unable to
connect either of these states directly to the superconducting TI surface, we
argue that one of them describes the 3D TI surface, while the other differs

interpreted either as estimating the global power spectrum of a stationary
process when only a portion of the data are available for analysis, or
estimating the power spectrum from local data under the assumption that the
data are locally stationary in a specified region. Restricting a global
function to a spatial subdomain -- whether by necessity or by design -- is a
windowing operation, and an equation like a convolution in the spectral domain
relates the expected value of the windowed power spectrum to the underlying
global power spectrum and the known power spectrum of the localization window.
The best windows for the purpose of localized spectral analysis have their
energy concentrated in the region of interest while possessing the smallest
effective bandwidth as possible. Solving an optimization problem in the sense
of Slepian (1960) yields a family of orthogonal windows of diminishing
spatiospectral localization, the best concentrated of which we propose to use
to form a weighted multitaper spectrum estimate in the sense of Thomson (1982).
Such an estimate is both more representative of the target region and reduces
the estimation variance when compared to estimates formed by any single
bandlimited window. We describe how the weights applied to the individual
spectral estimates in forming the multitaper estimate can be chosen such that
the variance of the estimate is minimized.

  conference in San Diego, August 2007",,"10.1117/12.732406",,"physics.data-an physics.space-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Satellites mapping the spatial variations of the gravitational or magnetic
fields of the Earth or other planets ideally fly on polar orbits, uniformly
covering the entire globe. Thus, potential fields on the sphere are usually
expressed in spherical harmonics, basis functions with global support. For
various reasons, however, inclined orbits are favorable. These leave a ""polar
gap"": an antipodal pair of axisymmetric polar caps without any data coverage,
typically smaller than 10 degrees in diameter for terrestrial gravitational
problems, but 20 degrees or more in some planetary magnetic configurations. The
estimation of spherical harmonic field coefficients from an incompletely
sampled sphere is prone to error, since the spherical harmonics are not
orthogonal over the partial domain of the cut sphere. Although approaches based
on wavelets have gained in popularity in the last decade, we present a method
for localized spherical analysis that is firmly rooted in spherical harmonics.
We construct a basis of bandlimited spherical functions that have the majority
of their energy concentrated in a subdomain of the unit sphere by solving
Slepian's (1960) concentration problem in spherical geometry, and use them for
the geodetic problem at hand. Most of this work has been published by us
elsewhere. Here, we highlight the connection of the ""spherical Slepian basis""
to wavelets by showing their asymptotic self-similarity, and focus on the
computational considerations of calculating concentrated basis functions on
irregularly shaped domains.

  We measure the dust extinction of the full sample of spiral galaxies and find
a smaller value than previous estimations, with an edge-on extinction of $E_0 =
0.284^{+0.015}_{-0.026}$ in the SDSS r band. We also find that the distribution
of minor to major axis ratio has a mean value of $ 0.267 \pm 0.009 $, slightly
larger than previous estimates mainly due to the lower extinction used; the
same affects the circularity of galactic discs, which are found to be less
round in shape than in previous studies, with a mean ellipticity of $0.215 \pm
0.013$.
  For elliptical galaxies, we find that the minor to major axis ratio, with a
mean value of $0.584 \pm 0.006$, is larger than previous estimations due to the
removal of spiral interlopers present in samples with morphological information
from photometric profiles. These interlopers are removed when selecting
ellipticals using Galaxy Zoo data.
  We find that the intrinsic shapes of galaxies and their dust extinction vary
with absolute magnitude, colour and physical size. We find that bright
elliptical galaxies are more spherical than faint ones, a trend that is also
present with galaxy size, and that there is no dependence of elliptical galaxy
shape with colour. For spiral galaxies we find that the reddest ones have
higher dust extinction as expected, due to the fact that this reddening is
mainly due to dust. We also find that the thickness of discs increases with
luminosity and size, and that brighter, smaller and redder galaxies have less
round discs.

planets is of fundamental importance to climate evolution but remains poorly
understood in general. Here we present a range of calculations we performed to
study the dependence of water loss rates from terrestrial planets on a range of
atmospheric and external parameters. We show that CO2 can only cause
significant water loss by increasing surface temperatures over a narrow range
of conditions, with cooling of the middle and upper atmosphere acting as a
bottleneck on escape in other circumstances. Around G-stars, efficient loss
only occurs on planets with intermediate CO2 atmospheric partial pressures (0.1
to 1 bar) that receive a net flux close to the critical runaway greenhouse
limit. Because G-star total luminosity increases with time but XUV/UV
luminosity decreases, this places strong limits on water loss for planets like
Earth. In contrast, for a CO2-rich early Venus, diffusion limits on water loss
are only important if clouds caused strong cooling, implying that scenarios
where the planet never had surface liquid water are indeed plausible. Around
M-stars, water loss is primarily a function of orbital distance, with planets
that absorb less flux than ~270 W/m^2 (global mean) unlikely to lose more than
one Earth ocean of H2O over their lifetimes unless they lose all their
atmospheric N2/CO2 early on. Because of the variability of H2O delivery during
accretion, our results suggest that many 'Earth-like' exoplanets in the
habitable zone may have ocean-covered surfaces, stable CO2/H2O-rich
atmospheres, and high mean surface temperatures.

Hamiltonians that arise in (p_{x}+ip_{y}) superconductivity. Specifically, we
show that general Haldane pseudopotentials (and their sums) can be expressed as
a sum of repulsive non-commuting (p_{x}+ip_{y})-type pairing Hamiltonians. For
the Laughlin sequence, it is observed that this problem is frustration free and
zero energy ground states lie in the common null space of all of these
non-commuting Hamiltonians. This property allows for the use of a new truncated
basis of pairing configurations in which to express Laughlin states at general
filling factors. We prove separability of arbitrary Haldane pseudopotentials,
providing explicit expressions for their second quantized forms, and further
show by explicit construction how to exploit the topological equivalence
between different geometries (disk, cylinder, and sphere) sharing the same
topological genus number, in the second quantized formalism, through similarity
transformations. As an application of the second quantized approach, we
establish a ""squeezing principle"" that applies to the zero modes of a general

filters simultaneously that gives a great advantage compared with monochrome
CCD detectors. The Bayer BGR colour system realized in CMOS sensors is close to
the Johnson BVR system. We demonstrate transformation from the Bayer color
system to the Johnson one. Our photometric measurements with color CMOS cameras
coupled to small telescopes (11 - 30 inch) reveal that in video mode stars up
to V $\sim$ 9 can be shot at 24 frames per second. Using a high-speed CMOS
camera with short exposure times (10 - 20 ms) we can perform an imaging mode
called ""lucky imaging"". We can pick out high quality frames and combine them
into a single image using ""shift-and-add"" technique. This allows us obtain an
image with much higher resolution than would be possible shooting a single
image with long exposure. For image selection we use the Strehl-selection
method. We demonstrates advantage of the lucky imaging technique in comparison
with long exposure shooting. The FWHM of the blurred image caused by atmosphere
turbulence can be decreased twice and more.

systematic study of the orbital-period distribution of sdB binaries in this

orbital-period distribution of long-period sdB binaries can be well explained
by this scenario. Furthermore, we find that, if the progenitors of the sdB
stars have initial masses below the helium flash mass, the sdB binaries
produced from stable RLOF follow a unique mass -- orbital period relation for a
given metallicity $Z$; increasing the orbital period from $\sim 400$ to $\sim
1100$\,d corresponds to increasing the mass of the sdB star from $\sim 0.40$ to
$\sim 0.49\,M_\odot$ for $Z=0.02$. We suggest that the longest sdB binaries
(with orbital period $> 1100$\,d) could be the result of atmospheric RLOF. The
mass -- orbital period relation can be tested observationally if the mass of
the sdB star can be determined precisely, e.g.\ from asteroseismology. Using
this relation, we revise the orbital period distribution of sdB binaries

full vacuum, with a packing fraction more than three times larger than

prevalent, and scalable computation is critical. All-distances sketches (ADS)
[Cohen 1997], are a powerful tool for scalable approximation of statistics.
  The sketch is a small size sample of the distance relation of a node which
emphasizes closer nodes. Sketches for all nodes are computed using a nearly
linear computation and estimators are applied to sketches of nodes to estimate
their properties.
  We provide, for the first time, a unified exposition of ADS algorithms and

which are applied to the ADS of a node to estimate a large natural class of
statistics. For the important special cases of neighborhood cardinalities (the
number of nodes within some query distance) and closeness centralities, HIP
estimators have at most half the variance of previous estimators and we show
that this is essentially optimal. Moreover, HIP obtains a polynomial
improvement for more general statistics and the estimators are simple,
flexible, unbiased, and elegant.
  For approximate distinct counting on data streams, HIP outperforms the
original estimators for the HyperLogLog MinHash sketches (Flajolet et al.
2007), obtaining significantly improved estimation quality for this
state-of-the-art practical algorithm.

particle-number conservation and time-reversal symmetry. It was previously
believed that the surface of an ETI must be gapless unless one of these
symmetries is broken. A well-known symmetry-preserving, gapless surface
termination of an ETI supports an odd number of Dirac cones. In this paper we
deduce a symmetry-respecting, gapped surface termination of an ETI, which
carries an intrinsic 2d topological order, Moore-Read x anti-semion. The
Moore-Read sector supports non-Abelian charge 1/4 anyons, while the Abelian,
anti-semion sector is electrically neutral. Time-reversal symmetry is
implemented in this surface phase in a highly non-trivial way. Moreover, it is
impossible to realize this phase strictly in 2d, simultaneously preserving its
implementation of both the particle number and time-reversal symmetries. A 1d
edge on the ETI surface between the topologically-ordered phase and the
topologically trivial time-reversal-broken phase with a Hall conductivity
sigma_H = 1/2, carries a right-moving neutral Majorana mode, a right-moving
bosonic charge mode and a left-moving bosonic neutral mode. The
topologically-ordered phase is separated from the surface superconductor by a
direct second order phase transition in the XY* universality class, which is
driven by the condensation of a charge 1/2 boson, when approached from the
topologically-ordered side, and proliferation of a flux 4\pi-vortex, when
approached from the superconducting side. In addition, we prove that
time-reversal invariant (interacting) electron insulators with no intrinsic

planetesimal-driven migration of Jupiter and Saturn, and the influence of their
mutual 1:2 MMR crossing on terrestrial planet formation for the first time, by
performing N-body simulations. These simulations considered distinct timescales
of MMR crossing and planet migration. In total, 68 high-resolution simulation
runs using 2000 disk planetesimals were performed, which was a significant
improvement on previously published results. Even when the effects of the 1:2
MMR crossing and planet migration were included in the system, Venus and Earth
analogs (considering both orbits and masses) successfully formed in several
runs. In addition, we found that the orbits of planetesimals beyond a ~1.5-2 AU
were dynamically depleted by the strengthened sweeping secular resonances
associated with Jupiter's and Saturn's more eccentric orbits (relative to
present-day) during planet migration. However, this depletion did not prevent
the formation of massive Mars analogs (planets with more than 1.5 times Mars'
mass). Although late MMR crossings (at t > 30 Myr) could remove such planets,
Mars-like small mass planets survived on overly excited orbits (high e and/or
i), or were completely lost in these systems. We conclude that the orbital
migration and crossing of the mutual 1:2 MMR of Jupiter and Saturn are unlikely
to provide suitable orbital conditions for the formation of solar system
terrestrial planets. This suggests that to explain Mars' small mass and the
absence of other planets between Mars and Jupiter, the outer asteroid belt must
have suffered a severe depletion due to interactions with Jupiter/Saturn, or by
an alternative mechanism (e.g., rogue super-Earths).

location of Tc-rich stars in the HRD matches remarkably well the
thermally-pulsating AGB, as it is predicted by the stellar-evolution models.
For pulsating stars with periods available, we compute the pulsation constant
and locate the stars along the various sequences in the Period -- Luminosity
diagram. We confirm the increase in mass along the pulsation sequences, as
predicted by the theory, except for W Ori which, despite being less massive,
appears to have a longer period than T Cet along the first-overtone sequence.

electromagnetic waves to minimize scattering. Herein, the effectiveness of
homogenized anisotropic materials in non-resonant dielectric multilayer
cloaking is studied. Because existing multilayer cloaking by isotropic
materials can be regarded as homogenous anisotropic cloaking from a macroscopic
view, anisotropic materials can be efficiently designed through optimization of
their physical properties. Anisotropic properties can be realized in two-phase
composites if the physical properties of the material are within appropriate
bounds. The optimized anisotropic physical properties are identified by a
numerical optimization technique based on a full-wave simulation using the
finite element method. The cloaking performance measured by the total
scattering width is improved by about 2.8% and 25% in eight- and three-layer
cylindrical cloaking materials, respectively, compared with multilayer cloaking
by isotropic materials. In all cloaking examples, the optimized microstructures
of the two-phase composites are identified as the simple lamination of two
materials, which maximizes the anisotropy. The same performance as published
for eight-layer cloaking by isotropic materials is achieved by three-layer
cloaking using the anisotropic material. Cloaking with an approximately 50%
reduction of total scattering width is achieved even in an octagonal object.
Since the cloaking effect can be realized using just a few layers of the
laminated anisotropic dielectric composite, this may have an advantage in the
mass production of cloaking devices.

systems software, analytical tools and human understanding. Numerous lessons on
the scalability of big data can already be found in asymptotic analysis of
algorithms and from the high-performance computing (HPC) and applications
communities. However, scale is only one aspect of current big data trends;
fundamentally, current and emerging problems in big data are a result of
unprecedented complexity--in the structure of the data and how to analyze it,
in dealing with unreliability and redundancy, in addressing the human factors
of comprehending complex data sets, in formulating meaningful analyses, and in
managing the dense, power-hungry data centers that house big data.
  The computer science solution to complexity is finding the right
abstractions, those that hide as much triviality as possible while revealing
the essence of the problem that is being addressed. The ""big data challenge""
has disrupted computer science by stressing to the very limits the familiar
abstractions which define the relevant subfields in data analysis, data
management and the underlying parallel systems. As a result, not enough of
these challenges are revealed by isolating abstractions in a traditional
software stack or standard algorithmic and analytical techniques, and attempts
to address complexity either oversimplify or require low-level management of
details. The authors believe that the abstractions for big data need to be
rethought, and this reorganization needs to evolve and be sustained through
continued cross-disciplinary collaboration.

is large compared with the first critical speed.
  It is given the leading order estimate of the ground state energy together
with the location of the vortices of the minimizing wave function in the bulk

the last decade witnessing a number of breakthroughs in the state of the art.
Most of the previous work has focused on the matching of textured objects using
local appearance descriptors extracted around salient image points. The
recently proposed bag of boundaries method was the first to address directly
the problem of matching smooth objects using boundary features. However, no
previous work has attempted to achieve a holistic treatment of the problem by
jointly using textural and shape features which is what we describe herein. Due
to the complementarity of the two modalities, we fuse the corresponding
matching scores and learn their relative weighting in a data specific manner by
optimizing discriminative performance on synthetically distorted data. For the
textural description of an object we adopt a representation in the form of a
histogram of SIFT based visual words. Similarly the apparent shape of an object
is represented by a histogram of discretized features capturing local shape. On
a large public database of a diverse set of objects, the proposed method is
shown to outperform significantly both purely textural and purely shape based
approaches for matching across viewpoint variation.

richer physics - involving pressures and shear forces of the mass-energy fluid
supporting the former - is attributed to the mixing of all three spatial
coordinates. Our (3+1)-d universe is the lowest dimension where such nontrivial
terms appear. An explicit example, the static zero tidal force (3+1)-d catenary

difference is that positive mass-energy is used to support the entire (3+1)-d
catenary wormhole, though violation of the null energy condition in certain
regions is inevitable. This general approach of first constructing the geometry
of the spacetime and then using the field equations to determine the physics to
support it has the potential to discover new solutions in general relativity or
to generalise existing ones. For instance, the metric of a time-evolving
inflationary wormhole with a conformal factor can actually be geometrically

Previous studies of C. albicans pathogenesis have suggested several steps must
occur before virulent infection, including early adhesion, invasion, and late
tissue damage. However, the mechanism that triggers C. albicans transformation
from yeast to hyphae form during infection has yet to be fully elucidated. This
study used a systems biology approach to investigate C. albicans infection in
zebrafish. The surviving fish were sampled at different post-infection time
points to obtain time-lapsed, genome-wide transcriptomic data from both
organisms, which were accompanied with in sync histological analyses. Principal
component analysis (PCA) was used to analyze the dynamic gene expression
profiles of significant variations in both C. albicans and zebrafish. The
results categorized C. albicans infection into three progressing phases:
adhesion, invasion, and damage. Such findings were highly supported by the
corresponding histological analysis. Furthermore, the dynamic interspecies
transcript profiling revealed that C. albicans activated its filamentous
formation during invasion and the iron scavenging functions during the damage
phases, whereas zebrafish ceased its iron homeostasis function following
massive hemorrhage during the later stages of infection. This was followed by
massive hemorrhaging toward the end stage of infection. Most of the immune
related genes were expressed as the infection progressed from invasion to the
damage phase. Such global, inter-species evidence of virulence-immune and iron

preparing a $^{87}$Rb BEC into the $d$-band and the superposition of $s$- and

of integers the sequence of fractional parts $(\{n_k x\})_{k \geq 1}$ is
uniformly distributed modulo 1 for almost all $x \in [0,1]$. Except for a few
special cases, e.g. when $n_k=k, k \geq 1$, the exceptional set cannot be
described explicitly. The exact asymptotic order of the discrepancy of $(\{n_k
x\})_{k \geq 1}$ is only known in a few special cases, for example when
$(n_k)_{k \geq 1}$ is a (Hadamard) lacunary sequence, that is when $n_{k+1}/n_k
\geq q > 1, k \geq 1$. In this case of quickly increasing $(n_k)_{k \geq 1}$
the system $(\{n_k x\})_{k \geq 1}$ (or, more general, $(f(n_k x))_{k \geq 1}$
for a 1-periodic function $f$) shows many asymptotic properties which are
typical for the behavior of systems of \emph{independent} random variables.
Precise results depend on a fascinating interplay between analytic,
probabilistic and number-theoretic phenomena.
  Without any growth conditions on $(n_k)_{k \geq 1}$ the situation becomes
much more complicated, and the system $(f(n_k x))_{k \geq 1}$ will typically
fail to satisfy probabilistic limit theorems. An important problem which
remains is to study the almost everywhere convergence of series
$\sum_{k=1}^\infty c_k f(k x)$, which is closely related to finding upper
bounds for maximal $L^2$-norms of the form $$ \int_0^1 (\max_{1 \leq M \leq N}|
\sum_{k=1}^M c_k f(kx)|^2 dx. $$ The most striking example of this connection
is the equivalence of the Carleson convergence theorem and the Carleson--Hunt
inequality for maximal partial sums of Fourier series. For general functions
$f$ this is a very difficult problem, which is related to finding upper bounds
for certain sums involving greatest common divisors.

Coxeter-Weyl group play a crucial role in determining the plane onto which the
lattice to be projected as well as the dihedral symmetry of the quasicrystal

determine the set of orthonormal vectors in nD Euclidean space which lead
suitable choices for the projection subspaces. The maximal dihedral subgroup of
the Coxeter-Weyl group is identified to determine the symmetry of the
quasicrystal structure. We give examples for 12-fold symmetric quasicrystal
structures obtained by projecting the higher dimensional lattices determined by
the affine Coxeter-Weyl groups Wa(F4), Wa(B6) and Wa(E6) . These groups share
the same Coxeter number h=12 with different Coxeter exponents. The dihedral
subgroup D12 of the Coxeter groups can be obtained by defining two generators
R1 and R2 as the products of generators of the Coxeter-Weyl groups. The
reflection generators R1 and R2 operate in the Coxeter planes where the Coxeter
element R1R2 of the Coxeter group represents the rotation of order 12. The

utilizes the Galerkin / finite-element method based on smooth periodic splines

compared with exact solitary and cnoidal wave solutions show that the scheme
achieves the optimal orders of accuracy in space and time. These computations

solitary waves in the Serre system is more inelastic. The efficacy of the

system: the unknown signal is a finite-length vector for which a fixed set of
linear measurements and a sparse representation basis are available and an
L1-norm minimization program is solved for the reconstruction. However, the
same representation and reconstruction framework is not readily applicable in a
streaming system: the unknown signal changes over time, and it is measured and
reconstructed sequentially over small time intervals.
  In this paper, we discuss two such streaming systems and a homotopy-based
algorithm for quickly solving the associated L1-norm minimization programs: 1)
Recovery of a smooth, time-varying signal for which, instead of using block
transforms, we use lapped orthogonal transforms for sparse representation. 2)
Recovery of a sparse, time-varying signal that follows a linear dynamic model.
For both the systems, we iteratively process measurements over a sliding
interval and estimate sparse coefficients by solving a weighted L1-norm
minimization program. Instead of solving a new L1 program from scratch at every
iteration, we use an available signal estimate as a starting point in a
homotopy formulation. Starting with a warm-start vector, our homotopy algorithm
updates the solution in a small number of computationally inexpensive steps as
the system changes. The homotopy algorithm presented in this paper is highly
versatile as it can update the solution for the L1 problem in a number of
dynamical settings. We demonstrate with numerical experiments that our proposed
streaming recovery framework outperforms the methods that represent and
reconstruct a signal as independent, disjoint blocks, in terms of quality of
reconstruction, and that our proposed homotopy-based updating scheme
outperforms current state-of-the-art solvers in terms of the computation time
and complexity.

data available in the Hubble Space Telescope Archive, this work shows that
there are, at least, two distinct physical components contributing to the
radiation in these tracers: the accretion flow sliding on the magnetosphere and
the atmosphere.
  The NV profiles are symmetric and at rest with respect to the star in most
sources. The velocity dispersion of the profile increases from non-accreting
(40 km/s) to accreting (120 km/s) TTSs suggesting that the macroturbulence in
the line formation region decreases as the stars approach the main sequence.
Evidence of the NV line being formed in a hot solar-like wind has been found in
RW Aur, HN Tau and AA Tau.
  The HeII profile has a strong narrow component that dominates the line flux;
the dispersion of this component ranges from 20 to 60 km/s. The sources of this
radiation is uncertain. Current data suggest that both accretion shocks and
atmospheric emission might contribute to the line flux. In some sources de HeII

semiforbidden OIII emission that has a critical density of about 3.4e10 cm-3.
  In spite of the different origins (inferred from the kinematics of the line

crystallize in the orthorhombic Ni3Sn2 type of structure (Pnma) and comprise
two inequivalent sites for the transition metal atoms (4c and 8d) and two Sn
sites (4c and 4c). The neutron data show that the substituting Fe atoms
predominantly occupy the 4c transition metal site and carry a lower magnetic
moment than Mn atoms. Four kinds of magnetic structures are encountered as a
function of temperature and composition: two simple ferromagnetic structures
(with the magnetic moments pointing along the b or c axis) and two canted
ferromagnetic arrangements (with the ferromagnetic component pointing along the
b or c axis). Electronic structure calculations results agree well with the
low-temperature experimental magnetic moments and canting angles throughout the
series. Comparisons between collinear and non-collinear computations show that
the canted state is stabilized by a band mechanism through the opening of a
hybridization gap. Synchrotron powder diffraction experiments on Mn3Sn2 reveal
a weak monoclinic distortion at low temperature (90.08 deg at 175 K). This
lowering of symmetry could explain the stabilization of the c-axis canted
ferromagnetic structure, which mixes two orthorhombic magnetic space groups, a
circumstance that would otherwise require unusually large high-order terms in

of elementary excitations whose energy spectrum strongly depends on
temperature. On this basis, the Landau superfluidity criterion is generalized
for several branches of elementary excitations, taking into account that the
critical velocity should vanish during the phase transition of liquid helium
from the superfluid state to the normal state. We suppose that a new spectrum
of excitations with a gap, depending on interparticle interaction, corresponds
to the transition of helium to superfluid state. This gap exists only in
superfluid state and disappears at the transition temperature to normal state.
The phonon-roton branch of excitations has no crucial influence on
superfluidity. Rotons, as well as phonons, are not the specific excitations for
the superfluid helium, but exist as universal excitations in liquid state, and
form the continuous branch of excitations in different liquids. This point of
view is confirmed experimentally and numerically.

on their horizontal branch color distribution and, when available, on the RR
Lyr variables fraction and period distribution. Based on our understanding of
the HB morphology in terms of varying helium content in the context of multiple
stellar generations, we show that clusters F2, F3 and F5 must contain
substantial fractions of second generation stars (~54-65%). On the basis of a
simple chemical evolution model we show that the helium distribution in these
clusters can be reproduced by models with cluster initial masses ranging from
values equal to ~4 to ~10 times larger than the current masses. Models with a
very short second generation star formation episode can also reproduce the
observed helium distribution but require larger initial masses up to about
twenty times the current mass. While the lower limit of this range of possible
initial GC masses is consistent with those suggested by the observations of the
low metallicity field stars, we also discuss the possibility that the
metallicity scale of field stars (based on CaII triplet spectroscopy) and the
metallicities derived for the clusters in Fornax may not be consistent with
each other. The reproduction of the HB morphology in F2,F3,F5 requires two
interesting hypotheses: 1) the first generation HB stars lie all at ""red""

field of Fornax, populating the HB at colours bluer than the blue side
((V-I)o<=0.3 or (B-V)o<=0.2) of the RR Lyrs, should be second generation stars
born in the clusters;a preliminary analysis of available colour surveys of
Fornax field provides a fraction ~20% of blue HB stars, in the low metallicity
range; 2) the mass loss from individual second generation red giants is a few
percent of a solar mass larger than the mass loss from first generation stars.

QCD equation of state (EoS). The model includes both hadron and quark degrees
of freedom and takes into account the transition of chiral symmetry restoration
as well as the deconfinement phase transition. At low temperatures $T$ and
baryonic densities $\rho_B$ a hadron resonance gas is described using a
SU(3)-flavor sigma-omega model and a quark phase is introduced in analogy to
PNJL models for higher $T$ and $\rho_B$. In this way, the correct asymptotic
degrees of freedom are used in a wide range of $T$ and $\rho_B$. Here, results
of this model concerning the chiral and deconfinement phase transitions and
thermodynamic model properties are presented. Large hadron resonance
multiplicities in the transition region emphasize the importance of heavy-mass
resonance states in this region and their impact on the chiral transition
behavior. The resulting phase diagram of QCD matter at small chemical
potentials is in line with latest lattice QCD and thermal model results.

both transverse and longitudinal motion by comparing and contrasting
time-distance images of parallel and perpendicular cuts along/across active
region fan loops. Comparisons between parallel space-time features in CoMP
Doppler velocity and transverse oscillations in AIA images are made, together
with space-time analysis of propagating quasi-periodic intensity features seen
near the base of loops in AIA. Signatures of transverse motions are observed
along the same magnetic structure using CoMP Doppler velocity
(Vphase=600-750km/s, P=3-6mins) and in AIA/SDO above the limb (P=3-8mins).
Quasi-periodic intensity features (Vphase=100-200km/s, P=6-11mins) also travel
along the base of the same structure. On the disk, signatures of both
transverse and longitudinal intensity features were observed by AIA; both show
similar properties to signatures found along structures anchored in the same
active region three days earlier above the limb. Correlated features are
recovered by space-time analysis of neighbouring tracks over perpendicular

turbulent electromagnetic fields. Understanding the transport of energetic
particles and the acceleration mechanisms for charged particles is an important
goal of today's astroparticle physics. Aims: To understand the acceleration
mechanisms at the particle source, subsequent effects have to be known.
Therefore, the modification of a particle energy distribution, due to
stochastic acceleration, needs to be investigated. Methods: The diffusion in
momentum space was investigated by using both a Monte-Carlo simulation code and
by analytically solving the momentum-diffusion equation. For simplicity, the
turbulence was assumed to consist of one-dimensional Alfven waves. Results:
Using both methods, it is shown that, on average, all particles with velocities
comparable to the Alfven speeds are accelerated. This influences the energy
distribution by significantly increasing the energy spectral index.
Conclusions: Because of electromagnetic turbulence, a particle energy spectrum
measured at Earth can drastically deviate from its initial spectrum. However,
for particles with velocities significantly above the Alfven speed, the effect
becomes negligible.

Universe began as primordial gas was processed in stars and mixed at galactic
scales. The mechanisms responsible for this development are not well understood
and have changed over the intervening 13 billion years. To follow the evolution
of matter over cosmic time, it is necessary to study the strongest (resonance)
transitions of the most abundant species in the Universe. Most of them are in
the ultraviolet (UV; 950A-3000A) spectral range that is unobservable from the
ground. A versatile space observatory with UV sensitivity a factor of 50-100
greater than existing facilities will revolutionize our understanding of the
Universe.
  Habitable planets grow in protostellar discs under ultraviolet irradiation, a
by-product of the star-disk interaction that drives the physical and chemical
evolution of discs and young planetary systems. The electronic transitions of
the most abundant molecules are pumped by the UV field, providing unique
diagnostics of the planet-forming environment that cannot be accessed from the
ground. Earth's atmosphere is in constant interaction with the interplanetary
medium and the solar UV radiation field. A 50-100 times improvement in
sensitivity would enable the observation of the key atmospheric ingredients of
Earth-like exoplanets (carbon, oxygen, ozone), provide crucial input for models
of biologically active worlds outside the solar system, and provide the
phenomenological baseline to understand the Earth atmosphere in context.
  In this white paper, we outline the key science that such a facility would
make possible and outline the instrumentation to be implemented.

of asset or index processes. Although most of the literatures treat the MVH
problem by the duality method, here we study a system consisting of three BSDEs
derived by Mania and Tevzadze (2003) and Mania et.al.(2008) and try to provide
more explicit expressions directly implementable by practitioners. Under the
Bayesian and Kalman-Bucy frameworks, we find that a relevant BSDE yields a
semi-closed solution via a simple set of ODEs which allow a quick numerical
evaluation. This renders remaining problems equivalent to solving European
contingent claims under a new forward measure, and it is straightforward to
obtain a forward looking non-sequential Monte Carlo simulation scheme. We also
give a special example where the hedging position is available in a semi-closed
form. For more generic setups, we provide explicit expressions of approximate
hedging portfolio by an asymptotic expansion. These analytic expressions not
only allow the hedgers to update the hedging positions in real time but also
make a direct analysis of the terminal distribution of the hedged portfolio
feasible by standard Monte Carlo simulation.

reflectivity of the FBG. When the FBG reflectivity tends to zero, the overall
resonant system exhibits the usual degenerate mode conditions. On the other
hand, when the reflection coefficient FBG is not vanishing, the spectral
features of the resonator display split resonant modes associated to the
degeneracy removal of two counterpropagating modes that resonate within the
cavity. The splitting magnitude is maximal in the region of maximum
reflectivity of the FBG. Moreover, it varies by acting on the FBG physical
parameters (e.g. strain, temperature, group index). By considering the spectral
region where the splitting magnitude variation is almost maximal, i.e. quasi
degenerate mode condition, we prove that the device can be used also as a slow
light sensor by monitoring the power change associated with the applied strain
showing, in this case, a sensitivity of 3.6x10^(6)x eps^(-1). To the best of

carcinogenesis as a model of cellular learning. We describe the hallmarks of
increased system plasticity of early, tumor initiating cells, such as increased

deformability, cell heterogeneity and network rearrangements. Finally, we argue
that the large structural changes of molecular networks during cancer
development necessitate a rather different targeting strategy in early and late
phase of carcinogenesis. Plastic networks of early phase cancer development
need a central hit, while rigid networks of late stage primary tumors or
established metastases should be attacked by the network influence strategy,
such as by edgetic, multi-target, or allo-network drugs. Cancer stem cells need
special diagnosis and targeting, since their dormant and rapidly proliferating
forms may have more rigid, or more plastic networks, respectively. The
extremely high ability to change their rigidity/plasticity may be a key
differentiating hallmark of cancer stem cells. The application of early
stage-optimized anti-cancer drugs to late-stage patients may be a reason of
many failures in anti-cancer therapies. Our hypotheses presented here underlie
the need for patient-specific multi-target therapies applying the correct ratio

three-dimensional, nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic process whose study is
relevant to the understanding of accretion and magnetic field generation in
astrophysics. Transition to this form of dynamo is subcritical and shares many
characteristics of transition to turbulence in non-rotating hydrodynamic shear
flows. This suggests that these different fluid systems become active through
similar generic bifurcation mechanisms, which in both cases have eluded
detailed understanding so far. In this paper, we investigate numerically the
bifurcation mechanisms at work in the incompressible Keplerian
magnetorotational dynamo problem in the shearing box framework. Using numerical
techniques imported from dynamical systems research, we show that the onset of
chaotic dynamo action at magnetic Prandtl numbers larger than unity is
primarily associated with global homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcations of
nonlinear magnetorotational dynamo cycles. These global bifurcations are
supplemented by local bifurcations of cycles marking the beginning of
period-doubling cascades. This suggests that nonlinear magnetorotational dynamo
cycles provide the pathway to turbulent injection of both kinetic and magnetic
energy in incompressible magnetohydrodynamic Keplerian shear flow in the
absence of an externally imposed magnetic field. Studying the nonlinear physics
and bifurcations of these cycles in different regimes and configurations may
subsequently help to better understand the conditions of excitation of
magnetohydrodynamic turbulence and instability-driven dynamos in various
astrophysical systems and laboratory experiments. The detailed characterization
of global bifurcations provided for this three-dimensional subcritical fluid
dynamics problem may also prove useful for the problem of transition to

will undergo both transmission and reflection when encountering a barrier of

transmission. In this paper we seek to explain the disappearance of
quantum-mechanical reflection in the quasi-classical limit, using standard
methods of decoherence through environmental interaction. We consider two
models. In the first, the incoming particle is classicalized by coupling it to
an environment described by a standard Lindblad master equation diagonalizing
in position. We find, however, that suppression of reflection is achieved only
for environmental interaction so strong that large fluctuations in momentum are
generated which blurs the distinction between incoming and reflected wave
packets. This negative conclusion also holds for a complex potential which has
similar implications for attempts to understand the suppression of the Zeno
effect using the same mechanism (discussed in more detail in another paper). A
different Lindblad master diagonalizing in momentum is shown to be successful
in suppressing reflection without large fluctuations but such a master equation
is unphysical. We consider a second model in which the barrier is modelled
quantum-mechanically by a massive target particle coupled to an environment to
maintain it in a quasi-classical state. This avoids the fluctuations problem
since the incoming particle is not coupled to the environment directly. We find
that reflection is significantly suppressed as long as the decoherence
timescale of the target particle is much smaller than certain characteristic
scattering timescales of the incoming particle, or equivalently, as long as the
velocity fluctuations in the target are larger than the velocity of the
incoming particle.

nonlinear agents with switching topology, noisy and delayed measurements. In
contrast to the existing stochastic approximation-based control algorithms
(protocols), a local voting protocol with nonvanishing step size is proposed.
Nonvanishing (e.g., constant) step size protocols give the opportunity to
achieve better convergence rate (by choosing proper step sizes) in coping with
time-varying loads and agent states. The price to pay is replacement of the
mean square convergence with an approximate one. To analyze dynamics of the
closed loop system, the so-called method of averaged models is used. It allows
to reduce analysis complexity of the closed loop system. In this paper the
upper bounds for mean square distance between the initial system and its
approximate averaged model are proposed. The proposed upper bounds are used to
obtain conditions for approximate consensus achievement.
  The method is applied to the load balancing problem in stochastic dynamic
networks with incomplete information about the current states of agents and
with changing set of communication links. The load balancing problem is
formulated as consensus problem in noisy model with switched topology. The
conditions to achieve the optimal level of load balancing (in the sense that if
no new task arrives, all agents will finish at the same time) are obtained.
  The performance of the system is evaluated analytically and by simulation. It
is shown that the performance of the adaptive multi-agent strategy with the
redistribution of tasks among ""connected"" neighbors is significantly better
than the performance without redistribution. The obtained results are important
for control of production networks, multiprocessor, sensor or multicomputer
networks, etc.

convergence to achieve the NE of the formulated game. Finally, considering the
alternative situation where the central unit does not exist, but the consumers

Cas A NS using all Chandra X-ray detectors and modes (HRC-S, HRC-I, ACIS-I,
ACIS-S in Faint mode, and ACIS-S in Graded mode) and adding a 2012 May ACIS-S
Graded mode observation, using the most current calibrations (CALDB 4.5.5.1).
We measure the temperature changes from each detector separately and test for
systematic effects due to the nearby filaments of the supernova remnant. We
find a 0.92%-2.0% decay over 10 years in the effective temperature, inferred
from HRC-S data, depending on the choice of source and background extraction
regions, with a best-fit decay of 1.0+/-0.7%. In comparison, the ACIS-S Graded
data indicate a temperature decay of 3.1%-5.0% over 10 years, with a best-fit
decay of 3.5+/-0.4%. Shallower observations using the other detectors yield
temperature decays of 2.6+/-1.9% (ACIS-I), 2.1+/-1.0% (HRC-I), and 2.1+/-1.9%
(ACIS-S Faint mode) over 10 years. Our best estimate indicates a decline of
2.9+/-0.9 (stat) +1.6/-0.3 (sys) % over 10 years. The complexity of the bright
and varying supernova remnant background makes a definitive interpretation of
archival Cas A Chandra observations difficult. A temperature decline of 1-3.5%
over 10 years would indicate extraordinarily fast cooling of the NS that can be
regulated by superfluidity of nucleons in the stellar core.

quiet Sun atmosphere close to disk center. Methods: We combine high-resolution
SoHO/MDI magnetograms with TRACE observations taken in the 1216 {\AA} channel
in order to analyze the temporal evolution of an emerging small-scale magnetic
loop and its traces in the chromosphere. Results: At first place, we find
signatures of flux emergence very close to the edge of a supergranular network
boundary located at disk center. The new emerging flux appears first in the MDI
magnetograms in form of an asymmetric bipolar element, i.e. the patch with
negative polarity is roughly two-times weaker than the corresponding patch with
opposite polarity. The average values of magnetic flux and magnetic flux
densities reach 1.6 x 10^18 Mx, -8.5 x 10^17 Mx, and 55 Mx cm^-2, -30 Mx cm^-2,
respectively. The spatial distance between the opposite polarity patches of the
emerged feature increases from about 2.5"" to 5.0"" during the lifetime of the
loop which was not longer than 36 min. A more precise lifetime-estimate of the
feature was not possible because of a gap in the temporal sequence of the MDI
magnetograms. The chromospheric response to the emerged magnetic dipole occurs
~ 9 minutes later with respect to the photospheric magnetograms. It consists of
a quasi-periodic sequence of time-localized brightenings visible in the 1216
{\AA} TRACE channel apparent for ~ 14 minutes and being co-spatial with the
axis connecting the two patches of opposite magnetic polarity. Conclusions: We
identify the observed event as a small-scale magnetic loop emerging at
photospheric layers and subsequently rising up to the chromosphere. We discuss
the possibility that the fluctuations detected in the chromospheric emission
probably reflect magnetic field oscillations which propagate to the
chromosphere in form of waves.

durable goods. The model suggests that after introduction goods spread always
according to a Bass diffusion. However, this phase will be followed by a
diffusion process for durable consumer goods governed by a
variation-selection-reproduction mechanism and the growth dynamics can be
described by a replicator equation. Describing the aggregate sales as the sum
of first, multiple and replacement purchase the product life cycle can be
derived. Replacement purchase causes periodic variations of the sales
determined by the finite lifetime of the good (Juglar cycles). The model
suggests that both, Bass- and Gompertz diffusion may contribute to the product
life cycle of a consumer durable. The theory contains the standard equilibrium
view of a market as a special case. It depends on the time scale, whether an
equilibrium or evolutionary description is more appropriate. The evolutionary
framework is used to derive also the size, growth rate and price distribution
of manufacturing business units. It predicts that the size distribution of the
business units (products) is lognormal, while the growth rates exhibit a
Laplace distribution. Large price deviations from the mean price are also
governed by a Laplace distribution (fat tails). These results are in agreement
with empirical findings. The explicit comparison of the time evolution of
consumer durables with empirical investigations confirms the close relationship
between price decline and Gompertz diffusion, while the product life cycle can
be described qualitatively for a long time period.

the x-ray spectra have been interpreted as Ultrafast Outflows (UFOs) -- highly
ionised material (e.g. Fe XXV and Fe XXVI) ejected at mildly relativistic
velocities. In some cases, these outflows can carry energy in excess of the
binding energy of the host galaxy. Needless to say, these features demand our
attention as they are strong signatures of AGN feedback and will influence
galaxy evolution. For the same reason, alternative models need to be discussed
and refuted or confirmed. Gallo & Fabian proposed that some of these features
could arise from resonance absorption of the reflected spectrum in a layer of
ionised material located above and corotating with the accretion disc.
Therefore, the absorbing medium would be subjected to similar blurring effects
as seen in the disc. A priori, the existence of such plasma above the disc is
as plausible as a fast wind. In this work, we highlight the ambiguity by
demonstrating that the absorption model can describe the ~7.6 keV absorption
feature (and possibly other features) in the quasar PG 1211+143, an AGN that is
often described as a classic example of an UFO. In this model, the 2-10 keV
spectrum would be largely reflection dominated (as opposed to power law
dominated in the wind models) and the resonance absorption would be originating
in a layer between about 6 and 60 gravitational radii. The studies of such
features constitutes a cornerstone for future X-ray observatories like Astro-H
and Athena+. Should our model prove correct, or at least important in some
cases, then absorption will provide another diagnostic tool with which to probe
the inner accretion flow with future missions.

multiplets. The U(1) duality invariance of the CCL sigma model proves to be
equivalent, in the dual chiral formulation, to a manifest U(1) invariance
rotating the two chiral scalars. Since the target space has a holomorphic
Killing vector, the sigma model possesses a third formulation realised in terms
of a chiral multiplet and a tensor multiplet.
  The family of U(1) duality invariant CCL sigma models includes a subset of
N=2 supersymmetric theories. Their target spaces are hyper Kahler manifolds
with a non-zero Killing vector field. In the case that the Killing vector field
is triholomorphic, the sigma model admits a dual formulation in terms of a
self-interacting off-shell N=2 tensor multiplet.
  We also identify a subset of CCL sigma models which are in a one-to-one
correspondence with the U(1) duality invariant models for nonlinear
electrodynamics. The target space isometry group for these sigma models
contains a subgroup U(1) x U(1).

Coagulation models have revealed numerous obstacles to the dust growth, such as

planetesimal formation via sweep-up and investigate whether it can take place
in a realistic protoplanetary disk. We have developed a new numerical model
that resolves spatial distribution of dust in the radial and vertical
dimension. The model uses representative particles approach to follow the dust
evolution in protoplanetary disk. The coagulation and fragmentation of solids
is taken into account using Monte Carlo method. A collision model adopting the
mass transfer effect, that can occur for different-sized dust aggregate
collisions, is implemented. We focus on a protoplanetary disk including a
pressure bump caused by a steep decline of turbulent viscosity around the snow
line. Our results show that sufficient resolution of the vertical disk
structure in dust coagulation codes is necessary to obtain adequately short
growth timescales, especially in the case of a low turbulence region. We find
that a sharp radial variation of the turbulence strength at the inner edge of
dead zone promotes planetesimal formation in several ways. It provides a
pressure bump that efficiently prevents the dust from drifting inwards. It also
causes a radial variation in the size of aggregates at which growth barriers
occur, favoring the growth of large aggregates via sweeping up of small
particles. In our model, by employing an ad hoc alpha viscosity change near the
snow line, it is possible to grow planetesimals by incremental growth on
timescales of approximately 10^5 years.

We
develop analytical framework and analyze percolation properties of a network

continuous function of the fraction of failed nodes. In sharp contrast, in
NetONet, due to the cascading failures, the percolation transition may be
discontinuous and even a single node failure may lead to abrupt collapse of the
system. We demonstrate our general framework for a NetONet composed of $n$
classic Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) networks, where each network depends on the
same number $m$ of other networks, i.e., a random regular network of
interdependent ER networks. In contrast to a \emph{treelike} NetONet in which
the size of the largest connected cluster (mutual component) depends on $n$,
the loops in the RR NetONet cause the largest connected cluster to depend only
on $m$. We also analyzed the extremely vulnerable feedback condition of
coupling. In the case of ER networks, the NetONet only exhibits two phases, a
second order phase transition and collapse, and there is no first phase
transition regime unlike the no feedback condition. In the case of NetONet
composed of RR networks, there exists a first order phase transition when $q$
is large and second order phase transition when $q$ is small. Our results can

through the careful spacing of the modifications on chromatin. An all-atom

  We derive an expression for the likelihood of the phylogenetic tree of
sampled infectives under our general epidemiological model. The analytic
concept developed in this paper will facilitate inference of past
epidemiological dynamics and provide an analytical framework for performing
very efficient simulations of phylogenetic trees under our model. The main idea
of our analytic study is that the non-Markovian epidemiological model giving
rise to phylogenetic trees growing vertically as time goes by, can be
represented by a Markovian ""coalescent point process"" growing horizontally by
the sequential addition of pairs of coalescence and sampling times.
  As examples, we discuss two special cases of our general model, namely an
application to influenza and an application to HIV. Though phrased in
epidemiological terms, our framework can also be used for instance to fit
macroevolutionary models to phylogenies of extant and extinct species,
accounting for general species lifetime distributions.

the airport surface at any time, while not starving the runway. Because some
departing flights are held at gates, there is a possibility that arriving
flights cannot access the gates and have to wait until the gates are cleared.
This is called a gate conflict. Robust gate assignment is an assignment that
minimizes gate conflicts by assigning gates to aircraft to maximize the time
gap between two consecutive flights at the same gate; it makes gate assignment
robust, but passengers may walk longer to transfer flights. In order to
simulate the airport departure process, a queuing model is introduced. The
model is calibrated and validated with actual data from New York La Guardia
Airport (LGA) and a U.S. hub airport. Then, the model simulates the airport
departure process with the current gate assignment and a robust gate assignment
to assess the impact of gate assignment on gate-holding departure control. The
results show that the robust gate assignment reduces the number of gate
conflicts caused by gate holding compared to the current gate assignment.
Therefore, robust gate assignment can be combined with gate-holding departure
control to improve operations at congested airports with limited gate
resources.

10, 13, 16, 19). Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT) with
generalized gradient approximations and van der Waals corrections, we have
calculated adsorption energies of dinitropentylpyrene, in which the
dinitromethane is linked to the pyrene via an aliphatic chain, on a CNT. A
75.26 kJ/mol binding energy has been found, which explains why such aliphatic
chain-pyrene units can be and have been used in experiments to bind functional
molecules to CNTs. The calculated electronic structures show that the
dinitromethane introduces a localized state inside the band gap of CNT systems
of n=10, 13, 16 and 19; such a state can trap an electron when the CNT is
photoexcited. We have therefore investigated the dynamics of intra-band
relaxations using the reduced density matrix formalism in conjunction with DFT.
For pristine CNTs, we have found that the calculated charge relaxation
constants agree well with the experimental time scales. Upon adsorption, these
constants are modified, but there is not a clear trend for the direction and
magnitude of the change. Nevertheless, our calculations predict that electron
relaxation in the conduction band is faster than hole relaxation in the valence
band for CNTs with and without molecular adsorbates.

recently given by Samet \emph{et al.} (Nonlinear Anal. 75, 2012, 2154-2165) by
using the concepts of $\alpha$-$\psi$-contractive type mappings and
$\alpha$-admissible mappings in metric spaces. The purpose of this paper is to
present a new class of contractive pair of mappings called generalized
$\alpha$-$\psi$ contractive pair of mappings and study various fixed point
theorems for such mappings in complete metric spaces. For this, we introduce a
new notion of $\alpha$-admissible w.r.t $g$ mapping which in turn generalizes
the concept of $g$-monotone mapping recently introduced by
$\acute{C}$iri$\acute{c}$ et al. (Fixed Point Theory Appl. 2008(2008), Article
ID 131294, 11 pages). As an application of our main results, we further
establish common fixed point theorems for metric spaces endowed with a partial
order as well as in respect of cyclic contractive mappings. The presented
theorems extend and subsumes various known comparable results from the current
literature. Some illustrative examples are provided to demonstrate the main
results and to show the genuineness of our results.

sequences are often needed to drive them into a state at which a desired
feature can be tested. This is particularly problematic in on-target testing,
where a system is tested in its real-life application environment and the time
required for resetting is high. This paper presents an approach to discovering
a test case chain---a single software execution that covers a group of test
goals and minimises overall test execution time. Our technique targets the
scenario in which test goals for the requirements are given as safety
properties. We give conditions for the existence and minimality of a single
test case chain and minimise the number of test chains if a single test chain
is infeasible. We report experimental results with a prototype tool for C code
generated from Simulink models and compare it to state-of-the-art test suite
generators.

therapy causing confounding by indication. Let us take as an example a new
therapy to treat cancer being compared to an existing therapy with
effectiveness taken as time to death. A challenging problem is that the ICER is
defined in terms of means over the entire treatment groups. It makes no
provision for stratification by groups of patients with differing risk of
death. For example, for a fair and unbiased analysis, one would desire to
compare time to death in groups with similar life expectancy which would be
impacted by factors such as age, gender, disease severity, etc. The method we

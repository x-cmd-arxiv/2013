B accepted for publication (2013)",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.87.224415",,"cond-mat.str-el","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We have carried out muon spin relaxation (muSR), neutron diffraction and
inelastic neutron scattering (INS) investigations on polycrystalline samples of
Ce(Ru1-xFex)2Al10 (x=0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8 and 1) to investigate the nature of the
ground state (magnetic ordered versus paramagnetic) and the origin of the spin
gap formation as evident from the bulk measurements in the end members. Our
zero-field muSR spectra clearly reveal coherent two-frequency oscillations at
low temperature in x=0, 0.3 and 0.5 samples, which confirms the long-range
magnetic ordering of the Ce-moment with TN=27, 26 and 21 K respectively. On the
other hand the muSR spectra of x=0.8 and x=1 down to 1.4 K and 0.045 K,
respectively exhibit a temperature independent Kubo-Toyabe term confirming a
paramagnetic ground state. The long-range magnetic ordering in x=0.5 below 21 K
has been confirmed through the neutron diffraction study. INS measurements of
x=0 clearly reveal the presence of a sharp inelastic excitation near 8 meV
between 5 K and 26 K, due to an opening of a gap in the spin excitation
spectrum, which transforms into a broad response at and above 30 K.
Interestingly, at 4.5 K the spin gap excitation broadens in x=0.3 and exhibits
two clear peaks at 8.4(3) and 12.0(5) meV in x=0.5. In the x=0.8 sample, which
remains paramagnetic down to 1.2 K, there is a clear signature of a spin gap of
10-12 meV at 7 K, with a strong Q-dependent intensity. Evidence of a spin gap
of 12.5(5) meV has also been found in x=1. The observation of a spin gap in the
paramagnetic samples (x=0.8 and 1) is an interesting finding in this study and
it challenges our understanding of the origin of the semiconducting gap in
CeT2Al10 (T=Ru and Os) compounds in terms of hybridization gap opening only a
small part of the Fermi surface, gapped spin waves, or a spin-dimer gap.

Numerical evaluation of the parallel MCO algorithm is provided in the report by
running the proposed algorithm on supercomputers in the High Performance

$\lambda\,850 \mu$m from the JCMT as well as the first maps at 617 MHz from the
GMRT. High latitude emission has been detected in both the radio continuum and
sub-mm for NGC 3044 and in the radio continuum for NGC 4157, including several
new features. The dust spectrum at long wavelengths required fitting with a
two-temperature model for both galaxies, implying the presence of cold dust.
Dust masses are $M_d\,=\,1.6\,\times\,10^8 M_\odot$ and
$M_d\,=\,2.1\,\times\,10^7 M_\odot$ for NGC 3044 and NGC 4157, respectively,
and are dominated by the cold component. There is a clear correlation between
the 617 MHz and $\lambda\,850 \mu$m emission in the two galaxies. In the case
of NGC 3044, this implies a relation between the non-thermal synchrotron
emission and cold dust. The 617 MHz component represents an integration of
massive star formation over the past $10^{7-8}$ yr and the $\lambda \,850 \mu$m
emission represents heating from the diffuse interstellar radiation field
(ISRF). The 617 MHz -- $\lambda\,850 \mu$m correlation improves when a
smoothing kernel is applied to the $\lambda\,850 \mu$m data to account for
differences between the CR electron diffusion scale and the mean free path of
an ISRF photon to dust. The best-fit relation is $L_{617_{\rm
MHz}}\,\propto\,{L_{850 \mu{\rm m}}}^{2.1\,\pm\,0.2}$ for NGC 3044. If
variations in the cold dust emissivity are dominated by variations in dust
density, and the synchrotron emission depends on magnetic field strength (a
function of gas density) as well as CR electron generation (a function of
massive star formation rate and therefore density via the Schmidt law) then the
expected correlation for NGC 3044 is $L_{617_{\rm MHz}}\,\propto\,{L_{850
\mu{\rm m}}}^{2.2}$, in agreement with the observed correlation.

reformulation of the kinetic equation which involves a natural decomposition of
the equation to the equilibrium and non-equilibrium parts. To achieve high
order accuracy and uniform stability as well as to capture the correct
asymptotic limit, two new ingredients are employed in the proposed methods:
discontinuous Galerkin spatial discretization of arbitrary order of accuracy
with suitable numerical fluxes; high order globally stiffly accurate
implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta scheme in time equipped with a properly chosen
implicit-explicit strategy. Formal asymptotic analysis shows that the proposed
scheme in the limit of epsilon -> 0 is an explicit, consistent and high order
discretization for the limiting equation. Numerical results are presented to
demonstrate the stability and high order accuracy of the proposed schemes
together with their performance in the limit.

peaks by the presence of electron-hole puddles gives quantitative agreement

calculated the following structural measures: average degree of the nearest
neighbours, central point dominance, clustering coefficient, the Pearson

networks with the same degree distribution may have distinct structural
properties. In particular, model B generates decentralized networks with a
larger number of components, a smaller giant component size, and a low global
efficiency when compared to the other algorithms, especially compared to the
centralized BA networks that have all vertices in a single component, with a
medium to high global efficiency. The other three models generate networks with
intermediate characteristics between B and BA models. A consequence of this
finding is that the dynamics of different phenomena on these networks may
differ considerably.

  In this work we propose the guided random forest (GRF) for feature selection.
Similar to a feature selection method called guided regularized random forest
(GRRF), GRF is built using the importance scores from an ordinary RF. However,
the trees in GRRF are built sequentially, are highly correlated and do not
allow for parallel computing, while the trees in GRF are built independently
and can be implemented in parallel. Experiments on 10 high-dimensional gene
data sets show that, with a fixed parameter value (without tuning the
parameter), RF applied to features selected by GRF outperforms RF applied to
all features on 9 data sets and 7 of them have significant differences at the
0.05 level. Therefore, both accuracy and interpretability are significantly
improved. GRF selects more features than GRRF, however, leads to better
classification accuracy. Note in this work the guided random forest is guided
by the importance scores from an ordinary random forest, however, it can also
be guided by other methods such as human insights (by specifying $\lambda_i$).
GRF can be used in ""RRF"" v1.4 (and later versions), a package that also
includes the regularized random forest methods.

Erdos arises from an application of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality (which is an
integral part of the Elekes-Sharir framework). Our analysis relies on two
number-theoretic results by Ramanujan.
  We also consider distinct distances in rectangular lattices of the form
$\{(i,j) \mid 0\le i\le n^{1-\alpha},\ 0\le j\le n^{\alpha}\}$, for some
$0<\alpha<1/2$, and show that the number of distinct distances in such a
lattice is $\Theta(n)$. In a sense, our proof ""bypasses"" a deep conjecture in
number theory, posed by Cilleruelo and Granville \cite{CG07}. A positive
resolution of this conjecture would also have implied our bound.

and the underlying magnetohydrodynamic turbulence driven by the
magneto-rotational instability (MRI). Using them to predict accurately
quantities such as stress, accretion rate, and surface brightness profile
requires that purely numerical effects, arising from both resolution and
algorithm, be understood and controlled. We use the flux-conservative Athena
code to conduct a series of experiments on disks having a variety of magnetic
topologies to determine what constitutes adequate resolution. We develop and
apply several resolution metrics: Qz and Qphi, the ratio of the grid zone size
to the characteristic MRI wavelength, alpha_mag, the ratio of the Maxwell
stress to the magnetic pressure, and the ratio of radial to toroidal magnetic
field energy. For the initial conditions considered here, adequate resolution
is characterized by Qz > 15, Qphi > 20, alpha_mag = 0.45, and a field energy
ratio of 0.2. These values are associated with > 35 zones per scaleheight, a
result consistent with shearing box simulations. Numerical algorithm is also
important. Use of the HLLE flux solver or second-order interpolation can
significantly degrade the effective resolution compared to the HLLD flux solver
and third-order interpolation. Resolution at this standard can be achieved only
with large numbers of grid zones, arranged in a fashion that matches the
symmetries of the problem and the scientific goals of the simulation.

offloading to pick some seed users as information sources, which help further
spread the information to others in an epidemic-like manner using
proximity-based communication. In this paper, we develop a theoretical
framework to study the issue of choosing only k seed users so as to maximize

the non-iterative imaging of unknown electromagnetic targets such as cracks in
the concrete walls or bridges, anti-personnel mines in the ground, etc. in the
inverse scattering problems. It is confirmed that this technique is very fast,
effective, robust, and can be applied not only full- but also limited-view
inverse problems if suitable number of incident and corresponding scattered
field are applied and collected. But in many works, the application of such
technique is somehow heuristic. Under the motivation of such heuristic
application, this contribution analyzes the structure of imaging functional
employed in the subspace migration imaging technique in two-dimensional inverse
scattering when the unknown target is arbitrary shaped, arc-like perfectly
conducting cracks located in the homogeneous two-dimensional space. Opposite to
the Statistical approach based on the Statistical Hypothesis Testing, our
approach is based on the fact that subspace migration imaging functional can be
expressed by a linear combination of Bessel functions of integer order of the
first kind. This is based on the structure of the Multi-Static Response (MSR)
matrix collected in the far-field at nonzero frequency in either Transverse
Magnetic (TM) mode or Transverse Electric (TE) mode. Explored expression of
imaging functionals gives us certain properties of subspace migration and an
answer of why multi-frequency enhances imaging resolution. Particularly, we
carefully analyze the subspace migration and confirm some properties of imaging
when a small number of incident field is applied. Consequently, we simply
introduce a weighted multi-frequency imaging functional and confirm that which
is an improved version of subspace migration in TM mode.

searched its low-energy structures globally using our developed multi-algorithm

successfully. More interestingly, we observed another phase (space group:
\textit{Pnma}, 62) that is more stable than $\omega$ and \textit{A}15. Its
stability is confirmed by its phonon spectra and elastic constants. For
$\omega$-Ta, the calculated elastic constants and high-temperature phonon
spectra both imply that it is neither mechanically nor dynamically stable.
Thus, $\omega$ is not the structure to which bcc-Ta transits before melting. On
the contrary, the good agreement of \textit{Pnma}-Ta shear sound velocities
with experiment suggests \textit{Pnma} is the new structure of Ta implied by
the discontinuation of shear sound velocities in recent shock experiment [J.

activity in the context of galaxy evolution, several studies have questioned
their importance or even their presence in QSO host galaxies. Accordingly, we
are conducting a study of z~0.2 QSO host galaxies previously classified as
passively evolving elliptical galaxies. We present deep Keck LRIS spectroscopy
of a sample of 15 hosts and model their stellar absorption spectra using
stellar synthesis models. The high S/N of our spectra allow us to break various
degeneracies that arise from different combinations of models, varying
metallicities, and contamination from QSO light. We find that none of the host
spectra can be modeled by purely old stellar populations and that the majority
of the hosts (14/15) have a substantial contribution from intermediate-age
populations with ages ranging from 0.7 to 2.4 Gyr. An average host spectrum is
strikingly well fit by a combination of an old population and a 2.1 (+0.5,
-0.7) Gyr population. The morphologies of the host galaxies suggest that these
aging starbursts were induced during the early stages of the mergers that
resulted in the elliptical-shaped galaxies that we observe. The current AGN
activity likely corresponds to the late episodes of accretion predicted by
numerical simulations, which occur near the end of the mergers, whereas earlier
episodes may be more difficult to observe due to obscuration. Our off-axis
observations prevent us from detecting any current star formation or young
stellar populations that may be present in the central few kiloparsecs.

debris disks using PACS on the Herschel Space Observatory. The survey includes
[OI] at 63 microns, as well as 70, 100 and 160um continuum, with the brightest
objects also studied in [OI]145um, [CII]157um, H2O and CO. Targets included T
Tauri stars and debris disks in 7 nearby young associations, and a sample of
isolated Herbig AeBe stars. The aim was to study the global gas and dust
content in a wide disk sample, systemically comparing the results with models.
In this paper we review the main aims, target selection and observing strategy.
We show initial results, including line identifications, sources detected, and
a first statistical study.
  [OI]63um was the brightest line in most objects, by a factor of ~10.
Detection rates were 49%, including 100% of HAeBe stars and 43% of T Tauri
stars. Comparison with published dust masses show a dust threshold for [OI]63um
detection of ~1e-5 M_solar. Normalising to 140pc distance, 32% with mass 1e-6 -
1e-5 M_solar, and a small number with lower mass were also detected. This is
consistent with moderate UV excess and disk flaring. In most cases, continuum
and line emission is spatially and spectrally unresolved, suggesting disk
emission. ~10 objects were resolved, likely from outflows. Detection rates in
[OI]145um, [CII]157um and CO J=18-17 were 20-40%, but [CII] was not correlated
with disk mass, suggesting it arises instead from a compact envelope.
  [OI] detection rates in T Tauri associations of ages 0.3-4Myr were ~50%. ~2
stars were detectable in associations of 5-20Myr, with no detections in
associations of age >20Myr. Comparing with the total number of young stars, and
assuming a ISM-like gas/dust ratio, this indicates that ~18% of stars retain a
gas-rich disk of total mass >1M_Jupiter for 1-4Myr, 1-7% keep such disks for
5-10Myr, and none remain beyond 10-20Myr.

ferrogels. In our description the magnetic particles are represented by hard
spheres with a magnetic dipole moment in their centers. Harmonic springs
connecting these spheres mimic the presence of a cross-linked polymer matrix. A
special emphasis is put on the coupling of the dipolar orientations to the
elastic deformations of the matrix, where a memory effect of the orientations
is included. Although the particles are displaced along one spatial direction
only, the system already shows rich behavior: as a function of the magnetic
dipole moment, we find a phase transition between ""soft-elastic"" states with
finite interparticle separation and finite compressive elastic modulus on the
one hand, and ""hardened"" states with touching particles and therefore diverging
compressive elastic modulus on the other hand. Corresponding phase diagrams are
derived neglecting thermal fluctuations of the magnetic particles. In addition,
we consider a situation in which a spatially homogeneous magnetization is
initially imprinted into the material. Depending on the strength of the
magneto-mechanical coupling between the dipole orientations and the elastic
deformations, the system then relaxes to a uniaxially ferromagnetic, an
antiferromagnetic, or a spiral state of magnetization to minimize its energy.
One purpose of our work is to provide a largely analytically solvable approach
that can provide a benchmark to test future descriptions of higher complexity.
From an applied point of view, our results could be exploited, for example, for
the construction of novel damping devices of tunable shock absorbance.

treat various singular integrals in the boundary element method (BEM). However,
the resultant integrands of the PCT tend to become nearly singular when (1) the

achieve a relatively high accuracy. In this paper, the first problem is
circumvented by using a conformal transformation so that the geometry of the

problem is alleviated by using a sigmoidal transformation, which makes the
quadrature points more concentrated around the near singularity.

We analysed about 93000 elliptical galaxies up to $z<0.2$, the largest sample

up-to-date K-corrections and used GalaxyZoo data to classify the galaxies in
our sample. We derived independent fundamental plane fits in all five Sloan

method was applied to obtain the coefficients of the fundamental plane, which
implicitly corrects for the Malmquist bias. We achieved an accuracy of 15% for
the fundamental plane as a distance indicator. We provide a detailed discussion
on the calibrations and their influence on the resulting fits. These
re-calibrated fundamental plane relations form a well-suited anchor for
large-scale peculiar-velocity studies in the nearby universe. In addition to
the fundamental plane, we discuss the redshift distribution of the elliptical
galaxies and their global parameters.

results demonstrate the following facts: (i) The density of states curve shows
that the attraction mechanism results in not only the charge-Kondo resonance
(i.e. elastic pair-transition resonance), but also the inelastic
pair-transition resonances and inelastic cotunneling resonances. These signals
are separated discernibly in asymmetric levels about Fermi level; (ii) The
differential conductance spectrum shows the distinct peaks or wiggles and the
abnormal split of pair-transition peaks under the asymmetric bias; (iii) The
improvement of bath-temperature can enhance the phonon-emission
(absorption)-assisted sequential tunneling and also strengthen the signals of
inelastic pair-transition under the asymmetric bias; (iv) The inelastic
dynamics driven by the ramp-up time-dependent voltage presents clear steps
which can be tailored by the duration-time and bath-temperature; (v) The
linear-response spectrum obtained from the linear-response theory in the

which chips move along edges according to a simple local rule. Properties of
the underlying graph are of course useful to the understanding of the game, but
since a conjecture of Biggs that was proved by Merino L\'opez, we also know
that the study of the Chip-firing game can give insights on the graph. In
particular, a strong relation between the partial Tutte polynomial $T_G(1,y)$
and the set of recurrent configurations of a Chip-firing game (with a
distinguished sink vertex) has been established for undirected graphs. A direct
consequence is that the generating function of the set of recurrent
configurations is independent of the choice of the sink for the game, as it
characterizes the underlying graph itself. In this paper we prove that this
property also holds for Eulerian directed graphs (digraphs), a class on the way
from undirected graphs to general digraphs. It turns out from this property
that the generating function of the set of recurrent configurations of an
Eulerian digraph is a natural and convincing candidate for generalizing the
partial Tutte polynomial $T_G(1,y)$ to this class. Our work also gives some
promising directions of looking for a generalization of the Tutte polynomial to

potential. Through the shape of the distribution, the critical surface which
separates the first order transition and crossover regions in the heavy quark
region is determined for the (2+1)-flavor case. Moreover, we determined the
critical point at finite density for two-flavor QCD with an intermediate quark
mass, using a Gaussian approximation of the complex phase distribution of the
quark determinant. The chemical potential dependence of the critical quark mass
is also evaluated in the situation where two light quarks and many massive
quarks exist. We find that the first order transition region becomes wider with
the chemical potential in the many-flavor QCD.

theory as an impurity solver for nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory.
The method is implemented and tested in the Hubbard model, using expansions up
to fourth order for the paramagnetic phase at half filling and third order for
the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phase away from half filling. We explore
various types of weak-coupling expansions and examine the accuracy and
applicability of the methods for equilibrium and nonequilibrium problems. We
find that in most cases an expansion of local self-energy diagrams including
all the tadpole diagrams with respect to the Weiss Green's function
(bare-diagram expansion) gives more accurate results than other schemes such as
self-consistent perturbation theory using the fully interacting Green's
function (bold-diagram expansion). In the paramagnetic phase at half filling,
the fourth-order bare expansion improves the result of the second-order
expansion in the weak-coupling regime, while both expansions suddenly fail at
some intermediate interaction strength. The higher-order bare perturbation is
especially advantageous in the antiferromagnetic phase near half filling. We
use the third-order bare perturbation expansion within the nonequilibrium
dynamical mean-field theory to study dynamical symmetry breaking from the
paramagnetic to the antiferromagnetic phase induced by an interaction ramp in
the Hubbard model. The results show that the order parameter, after an initial
exponential growth, exhibits an amplitude oscillation around a nonthermal value
followed by a slow drift toward the thermal value. The transient dynamics seems
to be governed by a nonthermal critical point, associated with a nonthermal
universality class, which is distinct from the conventional Ginzburg-Landau
theory.

pattern of mass segregation, etc. give valuable information on the formation
and evolution of the Galactic disk. The spatial distribution of young open
clusters will be used to revise the local spiral arm structure of the Galaxy.
In addition, the homogeneous data can also be used to test stellar evolutionary
theory, especially concerning rare massive stars. In this paper we present the
target selection criteria, the observational strategy for accurate photometry,
and the adopted calibrations for data analysis such as color-color relations,
zero-age main sequence relations, Sp - Mv relations, Sp - Teff relations, Sp -

Determination of the pre-saddle neutron multiplicity in our research is based
on the comparison between the experimental anisotropies and those predicted by
the standard saddle-point statistical model. Analysis of the results shows that
the pre-saddle neutron multiplicity depends on the fission barrier height and
stability of the compound nucleus. In heavy ion induced fission, the number of
pre-saddle neutrons decreases with increasing the excitation energy of the
compound nucleus. A main cause of this behavior is due to a reduction in the
ground state-to-saddle point transition time with increasing the excitation
energy of the compound nucleus. Whereas in induced fission by light particles,
the number of pre-saddle neutrons increases with increasing the excitation
energy of the compound nucleus.

precision has the same scaling with the number of atoms as the standard quantum
limit, but an improvement proportional to the free evolution time in the Ramsey

substantially larger than in standard Ramsey interferometry which is limited by
the coherence time of the atoms.

schemes into signature schemes. The derived scheme is provably secure in the
random-oracle model against classical adversaries. Still, the technique has
also been suggested to be used in connection with quantum-immune identification
schemes, in order to get quantum-immune signature schemes. However, a recent
paper by Boneh et al. (Asiacrypt 2011) has raised the issue that results in the
random-oracle model may not be immediately applicable to quantum adversaries,
because such adversaries should be allowed to query the random oracle in
superposition. It has been unclear if the Fiat-Shamir technique is still secure
in this quantum oracle model (QROM).
  Here, we discuss that giving proofs for the Fiat-Shamir transformation in the
QROM is presumably hard. We show that there cannot be black-box extractors, as
long as the underlying quantum-immune identification scheme is secure against
active adversaries and the first message of the prover is independent of its
witness. Most schemes are of this type. We then discuss that for some schemes
one may be able to resurrect the Fiat-Shamir result in the QROM by modifying
the underlying protocol first. We discuss in particular a version of the
Lyubashevsky scheme which is provably secure in the QROM.

high frequencies which entails instability of $AdS_3$. However, in contrast to
higher dimensions, the cascade cannot be terminated by black hole formation
because small perturbations have energy below the black hole threshold. This
situation appears to be challenging for the cosmic censor. Analysing the energy

interaction as well as the dispersion interaction are taken from ab initio
calculations or experimental measurements of a single water molecule. The
repulsive part of the interaction is parametrized to fit ab initio calculations
of small water clusters and experimental measurements of ice Ih. The
parametrized potential function was then used to simulate liquid water and the
results agree well with experiment, even better than simulations using some of
the point charge potentials fitted to liquid water. The evaluation of the new
interaction potential for condensed phases is fast because point charges are
not present and the interaction can, to a good approximation, be truncated at a
finite range.

knowledge of their evolution is crucial for our understanding of planet
formation. The Herschel Space Observatory is providing valuable data for
studying disc systems, thanks to its sensitivity and wavelength coverage. This
paper is one of several devoted to analysing and modelling Herschel-PACS
observations of various young stellar associations from the GASPS Open Time Key
Programme. Aims. The aim of this paper is to elucidate the gas and dust
properties of circumstellar discs in the 10 Myr TW Hya Association (TWA) using
new far-infrared (IR) imaging and spectroscopy from Herschel-PACS. Methods. We
obtained far-IR photometric data at 70, 100, and 160 microns of 14 TWA members;
spectroscopic observations centred on the [OI] line at 63.18 microns were also
obtained for 9 of the 14. The new photometry for each star was incorporated
into its full spectral energy distribution (SED). Results. We detected excess
IR emission that is characteristic of circumstellar discs from five TWA
members, and computed upper limits for another nine. Two TWA members (TWA 01
and TWA 04B) also show [OI] emission at 63.18 microns. Discs in the TWA
association display a variety of properties, with a wide range of dust masses
and inner radii, based on modified blackbody modelling. Both transitional and
debris discs are found in the sample. Models for sources with a detected IR
excess give dust masses in the range from 0.15 Msun to 63 Msun.

on the discrete gradient and time derivative of the numerical solution. Our
second result is the convergence (for a subsequence) of the numerical solution
towards a viscosity solution of the continuous HJ problem, as the mesh size
goes to zero. When the solution of the continuous HJ problem is unique, we
recover the full convergence of the numerical solution. We apply this scheme to
compute the densities of cars for a traffic model. We recover the well-known
Godunov scheme outside the junction point and we give a numerical illustration.

Optical Interferometer (NPOI), and shown to be a physical companion. Because
the primary is a supergiant of type O, for which dynamical mass measurements
are very rare, the companion was observed with NPOI over the full 7-year orbit.
Our aim was to determine the dynamical mass of a supergiant that, due to the
physical separation of more than 10 AU between the components, cannot have
undergone mass exchange with the companion. The interferometric observations
allow measuring the relative positions of the binary components and their
relative brightness. The data collected over the full orbital period allows all
seven orbital elements to be determined. In addition to the interferometric
observations, we analyzed archival spectra obtained at the Calar Alto, Haute
Provence, Cerro Armazones, and La Silla observatories, as well as new spectra
obtained at the VLT on Cerro Paranal. In the high-resolution spectra we
identified a few lines that can be associated exclusively to one or the other
component for the measurement of the radial velocities of both. The combination
of astrometry and spectroscopy then yields the stellar masses and the distance
to the binary star. The resulting masses for components Aa of 14.0 solar masses
and Ab of 7.4 solar masses are low compared to theoretical expectations, with a
distance of 294 pc which is smaller than a photometric distance estimate of 387
pc based on the spectral type B0III of the B component. If the latter (because
it is also consistent with the distance to the Orion OB1 association) is
adopted, the mass of the secondary component Ab of 14 solar masses would agree
with classifying a star of type B0.5IV. It is fainter than the primary by about
2.2 magnitudes in the visual. The primary mass is then determined to be 33
solar masses.

stiffness regimes that can be observed on a single-particle level, that is, on
the level of the monomers that make up the chain; the chains can even be
observed in concentrated systems without using molecular tracers. These methods
rely on the following: dipolar interactions induced by external electric fields
in combination with long-range charge repulsion to assemble the particles into
chains only, and a bonding step to ensure that the particles remain assembled
as chains even after the external field is switched off. We can control the
length and the flexibility of the chains. Additionally, we demonstrate that our
method is generally applicable by using it to prepare several other colloidal
polymers, such as block-copolymer chains, which are formed by combining rigid
and flexible chains, spherocylinders, which are formed by heating rigid chains,
and both atactic and isotactic chains, which are formed from
heterodimericparticle monomer units. We demonstrate that the flexibility of the
charged chains can be tuned from very rigid (rod-like) to semiflexible (as in
the simplified polymer model of beads on a string) by changing the ionic
strength. This method can, in principle, be used with any type of colloidal
particle. Moreover, our systems can be matched in terms of refractive index and

exchange to improve the distribution performance. We present a universal
swarming model where the chunks are distributed along different Steiner trees
rooted at the source and covering all the receivers. We assume chunks arrive
dynamically at the sources and focus on finding stable universal swarming
algorithms. To achieve the throughput region, universal swarming usually
involves a tree-selection subproblem of finding a min-cost Steiner tree, which
is NP-hard. We propose a universal swarming scheme that employs an approximate
tree-selection algorithm. We show that it achieves network stability for a
reduced throughput region, where the reduction ratio is no more than the
approximation ratio of the tree-selection algorithm. We propose a second
universal swarming scheme that employs a randomized tree-selection algorithm.
It achieves the throughput region, but with a weaker stability result. The
proposed schemes and their variants are expected to be useful for

translate to RG flows in the dual euclidean field theory. Consequently,
although the dual field is expected to be non-unitary, its RG flows will carry
an imprint of the unitary time evolution in the bulk. In this note we examine
the prediction of holographic RG in de Sitter space for the flow of double and
triple trace couplings in any proposed dual. We show quite generally that the
correct form of the field theory beta functions for the double trace couplings
is obtained from holography, provided one identifies the scale of the field
theory with (i|T|) where T is the `time' in conformal coordinates. For dS(4),
we find that with an appropriate choice of operator normalization, it is
possible to have real n-point correlation functions as well as beta functions
with real coefficients. This choice leads to an RG flow with an IR fixed point
at negative coupling unlike in a unitary theory where the IR fixed point is at
positive coupling. The proposed correspondence of Sp(N) vector models with de
Sitter Vasiliev gravity provides a specific example of such a phenomenon. For
dS(d+1) with even d, however, we find that no choice of operator normalization
exists which ensures reality of coefficients of the beta-functions as well as
absence of n-dependent phases for various n-point functions, as long as one
assumes real coupling constants in the bulk Lagrangian.

no more than $\epsilon n$-many nonblank cells. Based on a conjecture of
Nash-Williams, Daykin and H\""aggkvist conjectured that all $\frac{1}{4}$-dense
partial Latin squares are completable. In this paper, we will discuss the proof
methods and results used in previous attempts to resolve this conjecture,
introduce a novel technique derived from a paper by Jacobson and Matthews on
generating random Latin squares, and use this novel technique to study $
\epsilon$-dense partial Latin squares that contain no more than $\delta n^2$
filled cells in total.
  In particular, we construct completions for all $ \epsilon$-dense partial
Latin squares containing no more than $\delta n^2$ filled cells in total, given
that $\epsilon < \frac{1}{12}, \delta < \frac{
\left(1-12\epsilon\right)^{2}}{10409}$. In particular, we show that all $9.8

  We further show that such completions can always be found in polynomial time.
This contrasts a result of Colbourn. In Chapter 3, we strengthen Colbourn's
result to the claim that completing an arbitrary $\left(\frac{1}{2} +
\epsilon\right)$-dense partial Latin square is NP-complete, for any $\epsilon >
0$.
  Additional results on triangulations of graphs are found.
  In an unrelated vein, Chapter 6 explores the class of quasirandom graphs. In
specific, we study quasirandom $k$-edge colorings, and create an analogue of

countries. However, it causes different problems such as overuse of oil,
traffic jams causing earth pollution, health problems and an inefficient use of
personal time. One possible solution to these problems is carpooling, i.e.
sharing a trip on a private car of a driver with one or more passengers.
Carpooling would reduce the number of cars on streets hence providing worldwide
environmental, economical and social benefits. The matching of drivers and
passengers can be facilitated by information and communication technologies.
Typically, a driver inserts on a web-site the availability of empty seats on
his/her car for a planned trip and potential passengers can search for trips
and contact the drivers. This process is slow and can be appropriate for long
trips planned days in advance. We call this static carpooling and we note it is
not used frequently by people even if there are already many web-sites offering
this service and in fact the only real open challenge is widespread adoption.
Dynamic carpooling, on the other hand, takes advantage of the recent and
increasing adoption of Internet-connected geo-aware mobile devices for enabling
impromptu trip opportunities. Passengers request trips directly on the street
and can find a suitable ride in just few minutes. Currently there are no
dynamic carpooling systems widely used. Every attempt to create and organize
such systems failed. This paper reviews the state of the art of dynamic
carpooling. It identifies the most important issues against the adoption of
dynamic carpooling systems and the proposed solutions for such issues. It
proposes a first input on solving the problem of mass-adopting dynamic
carpooling systems.

measurements with bounded accuracy in the presence of noise and decoherence?
Here, we introduce a criterion to assess the fragility of large-scale quantum
states which is based on the distinguishability of orthogonal states after the
action of very small amounts of noise. States which do not pass this criterion
are called asymptotically incertifiable. We show that, if a coherent quantum
state is asymptotically incertifiable, there exists an incoherent mixture (with
entropy at least log 2) which is experimentally indistinguishable from the
initial state. The Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states are examples of such
asymptotically incertifiable states. More generally, we prove that any
so-called macroscopic superposition state is asymptotically incertifiable. We
also provide examples of quantum states that are experimentally
indistinguishable from highly incoherent mixtures, i.e., with an almost-linear
entropy in the number of qubits. Finally we show that all unique ground states
of local gapped Hamiltonians (in any dimension) are certifiable.

theories of Hamilton-Jacobi equations with constraints and homogenization, we
obtain results about the evolution of populations in environments with time
oscillations, the development of concentrations in the form of Dirac masses,
the location of the dominant traits and their evolution in time. Such questions
have already been studied in time homogeneous environments. More precisely we
consider the dynamics of a phenotypically structured population in a changing
environment under mutations and competition for a single resource. The
mathematical model is a non-local parabolic equation with a periodic in time
reaction term. We study the asymptotic behavior of the solutions in the limit
of small diffusion and fast reaction. Under concavity assumptions on the
reaction term, we prove that the solution converges to a Dirac mass whose
evolution in time is driven by a Hamilton-Jacobi equation with constraint and
an effective growth/death rate which is derived as a homogenization limit. We
also prove that, after long-time, the population concentrates on a trait where
the maximum of an effective growth rate is attained. Finally we provide an
example showing that the time oscillations may lead to a strict increase of the
asymptotic population size.

the benefits of complying with the protocol are particularly strong for nodes

within the very first astronomical units, and is still not well constrained as
the observational evidence has been gathered, until now, only by means of
spectroscopy. The young object HD200775 (MWC361) is a massive spectroscopic
binary (separation of ~15.9mas, ~5.0~AU), with uncertain classification
(early/late Be), that shows a strong and variable Halpha emission. We aim to
study the mechanisms that produce the Halpha line at the AU-scale. Combining
the radial velocity measurements and astrometric data available in the
literature, we determined new orbital parameters. With the VEGA instrument on
the CHARA array, we spatially and spectrally resolved the Halpha emission of
HD200775, at low and medium spectral resolutions (R~1600 and 5000) over a full
orbital period (~3.6 years). We observe that the Halpha equivalent width varies
with the orbital phase, and increases close to periastron, as expected from
theoretical models that predict an increase of the mass transfer from the
circumbinary disk to the primary disk. In addition, using spectral visibilities
and differential phases, we find marginal variations of the typical extent of
the Halpha emission (at 1 to 2-sigma level) and location (at 1 to 5-sigma
level). The spatial extent of the Halpha emission, as probed by a Gaussian
FWHM, is minimum at the ascending node (0.67+/-0.20 mas, i.e., 0.22+/-0.06 AU),
and more than doubles at periastron. In addition, the Gaussian photocenter is
slightly displaced in the direction opposite to the secondary, ruling out the
scenario in which all or most of the Halpha emission is due to accretion onto
the secondary. These findings, together with the wide Halpha line profile, may
be due to a non-spherical wind enhanced at periastron.

of the complex dielectric function shows a small shoulder at the edge of the
band gap, coinciding with the experiments. This intrinsic property of
crystallized monoclinic HfO2, which is absent in both the tetragonal phase and

the class of problems solvable by use of stochasticity under the Random
Polynomial time (RP) model is larger than the class of those solvable in
deterministic polynomial time (P). However, this question is only open for
Turing Machines, not for Random Access Machines (RAMs).
  Simon (1981) was able to show that for a sufficiently equipped Random Access
Machine, the ability to switch states nondeterministically does not entail any
computational advantage. However, in the same paper, Simon describes a
different (and arguably more natural) scenario for stochasticity under the RAM
model. According to Simon's proposal, instead of receiving a new random bit at
each execution step, the RAM program is able to execute the pseudofunction
$\textit{RAND}(y)$, which returns a uniformly distributed random integer in the
range $[0,y)$. Whether the ability to allot a random integer in this fashion is
more powerful than the ability to allot a random bit remained an open question
for the last 30 years.
  In this paper, we close Simon's open problem, by fully characterising the
class of languages recognisable in polynomial time by each of the RAMs
regarding which the question was posed. We show that for some of these,
stochasticity entails no advantage, but, more interestingly, we show that for
others it does.

interfacial free energies as a function of different densities of the LJ liquid

In the R package GWmodel, we introduce techniques from a particular branch of

situations when data are not described well by some global model, but where
there are spatial regions where a suitably localised calibration provides a
better description. The approach uses a moving window weighting technique,
where localised models are found at target locations. Outputs are mapped to
provide a useful exploratory tool into the nature of the data spatial

been the subject of discussions since the origin of the theory: is it ontic,
that is, does it correspond to a real property of the physical system? Or is it
epistemic, that is, does it merely represent our knowledge about the system?
Recent advances in the foundations of quantum theory show that epistemic models
that obey a simple continuity condition are in conflict with quantum theory
already at the level of a single system. Here we report an experimental test of
continuous epistemic models using high-dimensional attenuated coherent states
of light traveling in an optical fibre. Due to non-ideal state preparation (of
coherent states with imperfectly known phase) and non-ideal measurements
(arising from losses and inefficient detection), this experiment only tests
epistemic models that satisfy additional constraints which we discuss in
detail. Our experimental results are in agreement with the predictions of
quantum theory and provide constraints on a class of \psi-epistemic models.

Lyman-alpha emitters with equivalent widths ranging between 2 and 13 Angstroms.
The UV spectra show strong P Cygni-type high-ionization features indicative of
stellar winds and blueshifted low-ionization lines formed in the interstellar
and circumgalactic medium. We detect outflowing gas with bulk velocities of
about 400 km/s and maximum velocities of almost 900 km/s. These are among the
highest values found in the local universe and comparable to outflow velocities
found in luminous Lyman-break galaxies at intermediate and high redshift. The
outflow velocities are unlikely to be high enough to cause escape of material
from the galactic gravitational potential. However, the winds are significant
for the evolution of the galaxies by transporting heavy elements from the
starburst nuclei and enriching the galaxy halos. The derived mass outflow rates
of ~100 Msol/yr are comparable to, or even higher than the star-formation

sufficiently strong driving, it is not obvious what flow pattern an ideal

exclusion principle, which acts as a form of collective repulsion. We thus
study the flow of an ideal Fermi gas as it is driven out of a narrow orifice of
width comparable to the Fermi wavelength, employing both a microcanonical
approach to transport, and solving a Lindblad equation for Markovian driving
leads. Both methods are in good agreement and predict an outflowing current
density with a complex microscopic pattern of vorticity in the steady state.
Applying a bias of the order of the chemical potential results in a short-range
correlated antiferromagnetic vorticity pattern, corresponding to local moments
of the order of a tenth of a magneton, $e\hbar/2m$, if the fermions are
charged. The latter may be detectable by magnetosensitive spectroscopy in

P^{typ}(q) = e^{\bar{\ln P_{\cal J}(q)}} \sim e^{- \beta N^{\theta} \phi(q)} $,
where $\theta$ is the droplet exponent defined here with respect to the total
number $N$ of spins (in order to consider also fully connected models where the
notion of length does not exist); (ii) the rescaled variable $v = - (\ln
P_{\cal J}(q))/N^{\theta}$ remains an O(1) random positive variable describing
sample-to sample fluctuations; (iii) the averaged distribution $\bar{P_{\cal

statements hold for the cumulative overlap distribution $I_{\cal J}(q_0) \equiv
\int_{0}^{q_0} dq P_{\cal J}(q) $. These results are derived explicitly for the
spherical mean-field model with $\theta=1/3$, $\phi(q)=1-q^2 $, and the random
variable $v$ corresponds to the rescaled difference between the two largest
eigenvalues of GOE random matrices. Then we compare numerically the typical and
averaged overlap distributions for the long-ranged one-dimensional Ising
spin-glass with random couplings decaying as $J(r) \propto r^{-\sigma}$ for
various values of the exponent $\sigma$, corresponding to various droplet
exponents $\theta(\sigma)$, and for the mean-field SK-model (corresponding
formally to the $\sigma=0$ limit of the previous model). Our conclusion is that
future studies on spin-glasses should measure the {\it typical} values of the
overlap distribution or of the cumulative overlap distribution to obtain
clearer conclusions on the nature of the spin-glass phase.

the partition function for graphs of constant maximum degree $\Delta$ when
$\lambda<\lambda_c(\mathbb{T}_\Delta)$ where $\mathbb{T}_\Delta$ is the

flip-flop circuit is developed with an eye toward mimicking the dynamical
behavior observed for actual physical realizations of this circuit. It is shown
that the model exhibits most of the qualitative features ascribed to the R-S
flip-flop circuit, such as an intrinsic instability associated with unit set
and reset inputs, manifested in a chaotic sequence of output states that tend
to oscillate among all possible output states, and the existence of periodic
orbits of arbitrarily high period that depend on the various intrinsic system
parameters. The investigation involves a combination of analytical methods from
the modern theory of discrete dynamical systems, and numerical simulations that
illustrate the dazzling array of dynamics that can be generated by the model.
Validation of the discrete model is accomplished by comparison with certain
Poincar\'e map like representations of the dynamics corresponding to
three-dimensional differential equation models of electrical circuits that
produce R-S flip-flop behavior.

classical problem. Classical solutions proposed to solve this problem are
mainly adopting locking or blocking techniques. These techniques are not
suitable for cloud environments as they produce terrible response times; due to
the long latency and faultiness of wide area network connections among cloud
datacenters. One way to improve performance is to restrict access of
users-bases to specific datacenters and avoid data sharing between datacenters.
However, conflicts might appear when data is replicated between datacenters;
nevertheless change propagation timeliness is not guaranteed. Such problems
created data uncertainty on cloud environments. Managing data uncertainty is
one of the main obstacles for supporting global distributed transactions on the
clouds. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes an quota-based approach
for managing data uncertainty on the clouds that guarantees global data

from the hassles of managing data uncertainty, we propose to use a new platform

that proposed approach realized by the DCaaS service provides much better

aspects of the elastic differential cross section, the well known precipitous
descent in the forward direction and a sharp `dip' structure. To include a
complete description of data sets near -t=0, we correct the original
parametrization. We examine two possibilities, the presence of the two-pion
threshold singularity or a multiplicative factor reflecting the proton form
factor. We find good descriptions of LHC7 and ISR data in either case. The form
factor model allows simple predictions for higher energies through asymptotic
theorems and asymptotic sum rules in impact parameter space. We present
predictions for this model at higher LHC energies, which can be used to test

It is shown that Schottky barrier height characteristics are sensitive to the

The presence of a thin oxide interlayer, even of Ge native oxide, allows the

knowledge of the full phase space of stars in the Solar neighborhood, however,
is rather poor, and thus we cannot rule out the existence of a star that is

within the habitable zones of stars in more crowded stellar environments, such

interplanetary dust particles are highly enriched in (15)N. Conspicuous
nitrogen isotopic anomalies have also been measured in comets, and the
(14)N/(15)N abundance ratio of the Earth is itself larger than the recognised
pre-solar value by almost a factor of two. Ion--molecules, low-temperature
chemical reactions in the proto-solar nebula have been repeatedly indicated as
responsible for these (15)N-enhancements. We have searched for (15)N variants
of the N2H+ ion in L1544, a prototypical starless cloud core which is one of
the best candidate sources for detection owing to its low central core
temperature and high CO depletion. The goal is the evaluation of accurate and
reliable (14)N/(15)N ratio values for this species in the interstellar gas. A
deep integration of the (15)NNH+ (1-0) line at 90.4 GHz has been obtained with
the IRAM 30 m telescope. Non-LTE radiative transfer modelling has been
performed on the J=1-0 emissions of the parent and (15)N-containing dyazenilium
ions, using a Bonnor--Ebert sphere as a model for the source. A high-quality
fit of the N2H+ (1--0) hyperfine spectrum has allowed us to derive a revised
value of the N2H+ column density in L1544. Analysis of the observed N(15)NH+
and (15)NNH+ spectra yielded an abundance ratio N[N(15)NH+]/N[(15)NNH+] = 1.1
+/- 0.3. The obtained (14)N/(15)N ratio is ~ 1000 +/- 200, suggestive of a
sizeable (15)N depletion in this molecular ion. Such a result is not consistent
with the prediction of present nitrogen chemical models. As chemical models
predict large (15)N fractionation of N2H+, we suggest that (15)N(14)N, or (15)N
in some other molecular form, is preferentially depleted onto dust grains.

considered in this work. In the InGaAs/GaAs dots this nuclear spin polarization
mechanism is particularly pronounced, resulting in Overhauser shifts up to ~80
micro-eV achieved at optical excitation power ~1000 times smaller than the
power required to saturate ground state excitons. The Overhauser shifts
observed at low-power optical pumping in the interface GaAs/AlGaAs dots are
generally found to be smaller (up to ~40 micro-eV). Furthermore in GaAs/AlGaAs
we observe dot-to-dot variation and even sign reversal of the Overhauser shift
which is attributed to dark-bright exciton mixing originating from
electron-hole exchange interaction in dots with reduced symmetry. Nuclear spin
polarization degrees reported in this work under ultra-low power optical
pumping are comparable to those achieved by techniques such as resonant optical
pumping or above-gap pumping with high power circularly polarized light.
Dynamic nuclear polarization via second-order recombination of ''dark''

is large, violent fully developed turbulence is due to ""rough dependence on

initial data""; when the Reynolds number is moderate, (often transient)
turbulence is due to chaos. The key in the validation of the theory is
estimating the temporal growth of the initial perturbations with the Reynolds
number as a parameter. Analytically, this amounts to estimating the temporal
growth of the norm of the derivative of the solution map of the Navier-Stokes
equations, for which here I obtain an upper bound $e^{C \sqrt{t Re} + C_1 t}$.
This bound clearly indicates that when the Reynolds number is large, the

test-bed and demonstrator for the NEXT-100 neutrinoless double beta decay
experiment. In its current configuration the apparatus fully implements the
NEXT-100 design concept. This is an asymmetric TPC, with an energy plane made
of photomultipliers and a tracking plane made of silicon photomultipliers
(SiPM) coated with TPB. The detector in this new configuration has been used to
reconstruct the characteristic signature of electrons in dense gas.
Demonstrating the ability to identify the MIP and ""blob"" regions. Moreover, the
SiPM tracking plane allows for the definition of a large fiducial region in
which an excellent energy resolution of 1.82% FWHM at 511 keV has been measured
(a value which extrapolates to 0.83% at the xenon Qbetabeta).

evolution of the early universe, and two-particle correlations in heavy-ion
collisions. For the latter, numerical simulations of nearly-ideal, relativistic
fluids are necessary. The correlation functions of noise in relativistic fluids
are calculated, stochastic integration of the noise in 3+1-dimensional viscous
hydrodynamics is implemented, and the effect of noise on observables in
heavy-ion collisions is discussed. Thermal fluctuations will cause significant
variance in the event-by-event distributions of integrated v2 while changing
average values even when using the same initial conditions, suggesting that
including thermal noise will lead to refitting of the hydrodynamical parameters
with implications for understanding the physics of hot QCD.

fragmentation at 670 MeV per nucleon. The fragmentation products were injected
as highly charged ions into the GSI storage ring, giving access to masses and
half-lives. While the excitation energy of the first isomer of 212Bi was
confirmed, the second isomer was observed at 1478(30) keV, in contrast to the
previously accepted value of >1910 keV. It was also found to have an extended
Lorentz-corrected in-ring halflife >30 min, compared to 7.0(3) min for the
neutral atom. Both the energy and half-life differences can be understood as
being due a substantial, though previously unrecognised, internal decay branch
for neutral atoms. Earlier shell-model calculations are now found to give good
agreement with the isomer excitation energy. Furthermore, these and new
calculations predict the existence of states at slightly higher energy that
could facilitate isomer de-excitation studies.

existing sub-system in the automotive industry. It is produced to be used for
reproduction of the same experiment if other researchers are interested in.
Hence, it would be possible to compare the results of our published studies
with the results of similar tools. The data is collected for the purpose of
applying metaheuristic optimization approaches. The case study based on these
data shows that metaheuristic optimization approaches can find efficient
solutions for multiple quality attributes while fulfilling given constraints.
  The case study was conducted at Saab Automobile AB in order to evaluate the
AQOSA framework in an industrial context. AQOSA (Automated Quality-driven
Optimization of Software Architecture) is our architecture optimization
framework that supports multiple quality attributes including response time,
processor utilization, bus utilization, safety and cost.
  To enable validation of the results we selected an existing realization for
the Saab 9-5 Instrument Cluster Module ECU (Electronic Control Unit) and the
surrounding sub-systems. The goal of the case study is to find a better
solution than the current realization while fulfilling the requirements and
constraints. The results of the case study and the details of AQOSA framework
is reported in a paper from the authors in Journal of Systems and Software,

largest and fastest growing field of research in material science, because of
its exotic mechanical, thermal, electronic, optical and chemical properties.
The studies of graphene have also led to further research in exploring the
field of two dimensional (2D) systems in general. For instance, a number of
other 2D crystals (not based on carbon, e.g., boronitrene, silicone, graphane,
etc.) have been synthesized or predicted theoretically in recent years.
Further, theoretical studies have predicted the possibility of other 2D
hexagonal crystals of Ge, SiC, GeC, AlN, GaN, etc. The properties of these 2D
materials are very different from their bulk. We shall present the general
exotic properties of graphene like 2D systems followed by our computational
results on the structural and electronic properties of some of them.

This means that observable quantities, such as the current density, are not
affected by a gauge transformation. However what happens when the method of
second quantization is applied to convert a single particle theory into a field

invariant. This will be shown by considering the second quantization of a zero
mass Dirac field in 1+1 dimensions and examining the change of the current
density operator due to a gauge transformation.

in order to provide a better security mechanism, in this paper we propose
Enhanced Tiny Encryption Algorithm with Embedding (ETEA), a data hiding

algorithm is proposed based on Associative Memory Net (AMN). The AMN used in
this work is basically auto associative. The implementation is carried out
completely in 'C' language. To make the system perform to its best with minimal
computation time, a Parallel algorithm is also developed using an API package
OpenMP. Characters are mainly English alphabets (Small (26), Capital (26))
collected from system (52) and from different persons (52). The characters
collected from system are used to train the AMN and characters collected from
different persons are used for testing the recognition ability of the net. The
detailed analysis showed that the network recognizes the hand written
characters with recognition rate of 72.20% in average case. However, in best
case, it recognizes the collected hand written characters with 88.5%. The
developed network consumes 3.57 sec (average) in Serial implementation and 1.16
sec (average) in Parallel implementation using OpenMP.

renormalisability. Our study is restricted to theories of interacting scalar
fields. We have, in particular, shown that if a theory is renormalisable in the
usual power-counting sense then it remains renormalisable in the same sense
after a change of variables. This is due to the use of the powerful method of
the background field expansion. In the case of a single complex sclar field, it
turns out that the determination of the counter-terms is much simpler when
polar coordinates are used. We illustate this by carrying out a one-loop
calculation in the latter case.

the associated energy consumption overhead to mitigate the security risks.
Hierarchical routing protocol is more energy-efficient than other routing
protocols in WSNs. Many secure cluster-based routing protocols have been
proposed in the literature to overcome these constraints. In this paper, we
discuss Secure Energy-Efficient Hierarchical Routing Protocols in WSNs and

significantly in the infrared spectrum. The CO bands are also not present in

model suggests a slower growth of the capture rate with the DNA length for very
large DNA molecules than the previous model, motivating more experiments beyond
the current range of electric field and DNA length. At moderately weak electric
fields, our model predicts a different effect, stating that the DNA length
dependence of the capture rate first disappears as the field is reduced and
eventually reverses to a decreasing trend with $N$.

devoted to the study of quasars at z ~ 6. This paper focuses on the properties
of metals at high redshift traced, in particular, by the C IV doublet
absorption systems. Six objects were observed with resolutions ~27 and 34 km/s
in the visual, and 37.5 and 53.5 km/s in the near infrared. We detected 102 C
IV lines in the range: 4.35 < z < 6.2 of which 27 are above z ~ 5. Thanks to
the characteristics of resolution and spectral coverage of X-shooter, we could
also detect 25 Si IV doublets associated with the C IV at z>5. The column
density distribution function of the C IV line sample is observed to evolve in
redshift for z>~ 5.3, with respect to the normalization defined by low redshift
(1.5 < z <4) C IV lines. This behaviour is reflected in the redshift evolution
of the C IV cosmic mass density, Omega_CIV, of lines with column density in the
range 13.4 < log N(C IV) < 15, which is consistent with a drop of a factor of
~2 for z>~ 5.3. Considering only the stronger C IV lines (13.8 < log N(CIV) <
15), Omega_CIV gently rises by a factor of ~10 between z ~ 6.2 and z~ 1.5 with
a possible flattening toward z ~ 0. The increase is well fitted by a power law:
Omega_CIV = (2+-1)x10^{-8} [(1+z)/4]^{-3.1+-0.1}. An insight into the
properties of the C IV absorbers and their evolution with redshift is obtained
by comparing the observed column densities of associated C IV, Si IV and C II
absorptions with the output of a set of CLOUDY photo-ionization models. As
already claimed by cosmological simulations, we find that C IV is a good tracer
of the metallicity in the low-density intergalacitc medium gas at z ~ 5-6 while
at z ~ 3 it arises in gas with over density delta ~100.

include scaling factors (internal scaling) that cannot be removed by reference
point change. Line elements and path lengths, as integrals over space and/or
time, show the effect of scaling on geometry. In one example, the scaling
factor goes to 0 as the time goes to 0, the big bang time. All path lengths,
and values of physical quantities, are crushed to 0 as $t$ goes to 0. Other
examples have spherically symmetric scaling factors about some point, $x.$ In
one type, a black scaling hole, the scaling factor goes to infinity as the
distance, $d$, between any point $y$ and $x$ goes to 0. For scaling white
holes, the scaling factor goes to 0 as $d$ goes to 0. For black scaling holes,
path lengths from a reference point, $z$, to $y$ become infinite as $y$
approaches $x.$ For white holes, path lengths approach a value much less than
the unscaled distance from $z$ to $x.$

  do not impede diffusion",,,,,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider models given by Hamiltonians of the form
$$H(I,\phi,p,q,t;\epsilon) = h(I) + \sum_{j = 1}^n \pm(\frac{1}{2} p_j^2 +
V_j(q_j)) + \epsilon Q(I,\phi,p,q,t;\epsilon)$$ where $I,\phi$ are
d-dimensional actions and angles, $p,q$ are n-dimensional real conjugated
variables, and $t$ is an angle. These are higher dimensional analogues, both in
the center and hyperbolic directions, of the models studied in previous papers
by the athors. All these models present the large gap problem.
  We show that, for $\epsilon$ small enough, under regularity and explicit
non-degeneracy conditions on the model, there are orbits whose action variables
$I$ perform rather arbitrary excursions in a domain of size O(1). This domain
includes resonance lines and, hence, large gaps among $d$-dimensional KAM tori.
  The method of proof follows closely the strategy of [DLS(=Delshams, Llave and
Seara) 2006]. The main new phenomenon that appears when the dimension $d$ of
the center directions is larger than one, is the existence of multiple
resonances. We show that, since these multiple resonances happen in sets of
codimension greater than one in the space of actions $I$, they can be
contoured. This corresponds to the mechanism called diffusion across resonances
in the Physics literature.
  The present paper, however, differs substantially from [DLS 2006]. On the
technical details of the proofs, we have taken advantage of the theory of the
scattering map [DLS 2008], not available when the above papers were written. We
have analyzed the conditions imposed on the resonances in more detail.
  More precisely, we have found that there is a simple condition on the
Melnikov potential which allows us to conclude that the resonances are crossed.
In particular, this condition does not depend on the resonances. So that the
results are new even when applied to the models in [DLS 2006].

described by quantum mechanics. Most methods, such as Doppler cooling,
polarization gradient cooling or sub-recoil laser cooling rely, however, on a
near-resonant and cyclic coupling between laser light and well-defined internal
states. Although this feat has recently even been achieved for diatomic
molecules, it is very hard for mesoscopic particles. It has been proposed that
an external cavity may compensate for the lack of internal cycling transitions
in dielectric objects and it may thus provide assistance in the cooling of
their centre of mass state. Here, we demonstrate cavity cooling of the
transverse kinetic energy of silicon nanoparticles propagating in genuine
high-vacuum (< 10^8 mbar). We create and launch them with longitudinal
velocities even down to v < 1 m/s using laser induced thermomechanical stress
on a pristine silicon wafer. The interaction with the light of a high-finesse
infrared cavity reduces their transverse kinetic energy by more than a factor
of 30. This is an important step towards new tests of recent proposals to
explore the still speculative non-linearities of quantum mechanics with objects

frictionless sphere packings in two-dimensions with the introduction of the
jamming graph. Minimal rigidity is a purely combinatorial property encoded via
Laman's theorem in two-dimensions. It constrains the global, average
coordination number of the graph, for example. However, minimal rigidity does
not address the geometry of local mechanical stability. The jamming graph
contains both properties of global mechanical stability at the onset of jamming
and local mechanical stability. We demonstrate how jamming graphs can be
constructed using local moves via the Henneberg construction such that these
graphs fall under the jurisdiction of correlated percolation. We then probe how
jamming graphs destabilize, or become unjammed, by deleting a bond and
computing the resulting rigid cluster distribution. We also study how the
system restabilizes with the addition of new contacts and how a jamming graph
with extra/redundant contacts destabilizes. The latter endeavor allows us to
probe a disc packing in the rigid phase and uncover a potentially new diverging
lengthscale associated with the random deletion of contacts as compared to the
study of cut-out (or frozen in) subsystems.

trimethylamine N- oxide (TMAO) which favors protein folding and the denaturing
osmolyte urea are addressed by studying their effects on the folding of
uncharged polymer chains. Using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we
show that 1-M TMAO and 7-M urea solutions act dramatically differently on these
model polymer chains. Their behaviors are sensitive to the strength of the
attractive dispersion interactions of the chain with its environment: when
these dispersion interactions are high enough, TMAO suppresses the formation of
extended conformations of the hydrophobic polymer as compared to water, while
urea promotes formation of extended conformations. Similar trends are observed
experimentally on real protein systems. Quite surprisingly, we find that both
protecting and denaturing osmolytes strongly interact with the polymer,
seemingly in contrast with existing explanations of the osmolyte effect on
proteins. We show that what really matters for a protective osmolyte is its
effective depletion as the polymer conformation changes, which leads to a
negative change in the preferential binding coefficient. For TMAO, there is a
much more favorable free energy of insertion of a single osmolyte near
collapsed conformations of the polymer than near extended conformations. By
contrast, urea is preferentially stabilized next to the extended conformation
and thus has a denaturing effect.

since the Klein-Gordon equations for {\lambda} and {\rho} possess solutions
that are not solutions of the csfopde for {\lambda} and {\rho} we infer that it
is legitimate to attribute to those fields mass dimension 3/2 (as is the case
of Dirac spinor fields) and not mass dimension 1 as previously suggested in
recent literature (see list of references). A proof of this fact is offered by
deriving the csfopde for the {\lambda} and {\rho} from a Lagrangian where these
fields have indeed mass dimension 3/2. Taking seriously the view that Elko
spinor fields due to its special properties given by their bilinear invariants
may be the description of some kind of particles in the real world a question
then arises: what is the physical meaning of these fields? Here we proposed
that the fields {\lambda} and {\rho} serve the purpose of building the fields K
and M (see Eq.(38))which are Clifford valued multiform fields representing
spinor fields in the Clifford bundle. They are electrically neutral and do not
couple to the electromagnetic field but carry magnetic like charges which
permit them to couple to a su(2) valued potential. If the potential is of short
range the particles described by the K and M fields may be interacting and
forming condensates of zero spin particles analogous to dark matter, in the
sense that they do not couple with the electromagnetic field (generated by
charged particles) and are thus invisible. We calculate the correct propagators
for the K and M fields. We discuss also the main difference between Elko and

without using virus signatures. But these methods are more likely to generate
false positives. There is a positive correlation between the capability to

emission, are embedded in a diffuse loop structure of ~1 arcmin in radius.
Their near-infrared spectra reveal characteristics of late O- or early B-type
stars with numerous H and He I absorption lines, and we classify their spectral
types to be between O9 and B2 based on an empirical relation derived here
between the equivalent widths of the H lines and stellar photospheric
temperatures. The spectral types, combined with the results of spectral energy
distribution fits, constrain the distance to the objects to be 6.0 +/- 0.4 kpc.

enhancement of matter in the western part of the loop. If these objects
originate via triggered formation by the progenitor star of G54.1+0.3, then
their formations likely began during the later evolutionary stages of the

for the rest we obtain the preferred values for the lightest neutrino mass and
Dirac CP phase. We find that there are strong similarities between one diagonal
texture zero models with one mass hierarchy and one diagonal cofactor zero
models with the opposite mass hierarchy. We also make predictions for

processor, memory speed, memory size, storage space etc. there is no
improvement in virus scanning time. Although the processing speed has
substantially increased, a typical full scanning is still taking several hours
for an average computer. There is a serious need to improve the scanning time.
  Contradiction is a stage of problem solving where the nature of the actual
problem is clearly explained in terms of at least two parameters, one improving
and another worsening. While emphasizing one parameter strengthens the system
position emphasizing another parameter weakens the system.
  In conventional methods a problem solver has to make a perfect balance
between these conflicting parameters, where the situation is neither too much
on one side nor too much on the other. The results of those methods, although
increase the speed of virus scanning, results in disadvantages like load on
processor, increase in false positives and compromise on security. The
objective of TRIZ is not to accept a tradeoff between the speed of scanning and
those other difficulties but to resolve the contradictions so that the speed of
scanning increases without compromising with security and other harmful
results.

pollution of pristine gas in turbulent flows, designed to provide new tools for
modeling the evolution of the first generation of stars. The properties of such
Population III (Pop III) stars are thought to be very different than later
generations, because cooling is dramatically different in gas with a
metallicity below a critical value Z_c, which lies between ~10^-6 and 10^-3
solar value. Z_c is much smaller than the typical average metallicity, <Z>, and
thus the mixing efficiency of the pristine gas in the interstellar medium plays
a crucial role in the transition from Pop III to normal star formation. The
small critical value, Z_c, corresponds to the far left tail of the probability
distribution function (PDF) of the metallicity. Based on closure models for the
PDF formulation of turbulent mixing, we derive equations for the fraction of
gas, P, lying below Z_c, in compressible turbulence. Our simulation data shows
that the evolution of the fraction P can be well approximated by a generalized
self-convolution model, which predicts dP/dt = -n/tau_con P (1-P^(1/n)), where
n is a measure of the locality of the PDF convolution and the timescale tau_con
is determined by the rate at which turbulence stretches the pollutants. Using a
suite of simulations with Mach numbers ranging from M = 0.9 to 6.2, we provide
accurate fits to n and tau_con as a function of M, Z_c/<Z>, and the scale, L_p,
at which pollutants are added to the flow. For P>0.9, mixing occurs only in the
regions surrounding the pollutants, such that n=1. For smaller P, n is larger
as mixing becomes more global. We show how the results can be used to construct
one-zone models for the evolution of Pop III stars in a single high-redshift
galaxy, as well as subgrid models for tracking the evolution of the first stars

atmospheres of the hottest planets are less efficient at redistributing the
stellar energy absorbed on their daysides---and thus have a larger day-night
temperature contrast---than colder planets. No predictive atmospheric model has
been published that identifies which dynamical mechanisms determine the
atmospheric heat redistribution efficiency on tidally locked exoplanets. Here
we present a two-layer shallow water model of the atmospheric dynamics on
synchronously rotating planets that explains the observed trend. Our model
shows that planets with weak friction and weak irradiation exhibit a banded
zonal flow with minimal day-night temperature differences, while models with
strong irradiation and/or strong friction exhibit a day-night flow pattern with
order-unity fractional day-night temperature differences. To interpret the
model, we develop a scaling theory that shows that the timescale for gravity
waves to propagate horizontally over planetary scales, t_wave, plays a dominant
role in controlling the transition from small to large temperature contrasts.
This implies that heat redistribution is governed by a wave-like process,
similar to the one responsible for the weak temperature gradients in the
Earth's tropics. When atmospheric drag can be neglected, the transition from
small to large day-night temperature contrasts occurs when t_wave ~
sqrt(t_rad/Omega), where t_rad is the radiative relaxation time and Omega is
the planetary rotation frequency. Alternatively, this transition criterion can
be expressed as t_rad ~ t_vert, where t_vert is the timescale for a fluid
parcel to move vertically over the difference in day-night thickness. These
results subsume the commonly used timescale comparison for estimating heat
redistribution efficiency between t_rad and the global horizontal advection
timescale, t_adv.

studies by fully considering not only the field-like contribution from the
spin-orbit torque, but also the recently derived Slonczewski-like spin-orbit
torque. We show that the latter interaction affects both the domain wall
velocity and the Walker breakdown threshold non-trivially, which suggests that
it should be accounted in experimental data analysis. We find that the presence
of multiple spin-orbit torques may render the Walker breakdown to be universal
in the sense that the threshold is completely independent on the
material-dependent Gilbert damping, non-adiabaticity, and the chirality of the
domain wall. We also find that domain wall motion against the current injection
is sustained in the presence of multiple spin-orbit torques and that the wall
profile will determine the qualitative influence of these different types of
torques (e.g. field-like and Slonczewski-like). In addition, we consider a
uniform ferromagnetic layer under a current bias, and find that the resonance
frequency becomes asymmetric against the current direction in the presence of
Slonczewski-like spin-orbit coupling. This is in contrast with those cases
where such an interaction is absent, where the frequency is found to be
symmetric with respect to the current direction. This finding shows that

a Semidefinite Program (SDP), enabling us to derive sufficient and necessary

constraining cosmological parameters, when combined with the power spectrum
tomography, based on the Fisher information matrix formalism. To account for
the full information at two- and three-point levels, we include all the power
spectrum and bispectrum information built from all-available combinations of
tomographic redshift bins, multipole bins and different triangle configurations
over a range of angular scales (up to lmax=2000 as our fiducial choice). For
the parameter forecast, we use the halo model approach in Kayo, Takada & Jain
(2013) to model the non-Gaussian error covariances as well as the
cross-covariance between the power spectrum and the bispectrum, including the
halo sample variance or the nonlinear version of beat-coupling. We find that
adding the bispectrum information leads to about 60% improvement in the dark
energy figure-of-merit compared to the lensing power spectrum tomography alone,
for three redshift-bin tomography and a Subaru-type survey probing galaxies at
typical redshift of zs~1. The improvement is equivalent to a 1.6 larger survey
area. Thus our results show that the bispectrum or more generally any
three-point correlation based statistics carries complementary information on
cosmological parameters to the power spectrum. However, the improvement is
modest compared to the previous claim derived using the Gaussian error
assumption, and therefore our results imply less additional information in even
higher-order moments such as the four-point correlation function.

dominated by emission from Fe XII showing plasma at temperatures around 1.5 MK.
We analyze part of the Hi-C field-of-view to study the smallest coronal loops
observed so far and search for the a possible sub-structuring of larger loops.
We find tiny 1.5 MK loop-like structures that we interpret as miniature coronal
loops. These have length of the coronal segment above the chromosphere of only
about 1 Mm and a thickness of less than 200 km. They could be interpreted as
the coronal signature of small flux tubes breaking through the photosphere with
a footpoint distance corresponding to the diameter of a cell of granulation. We
find loops that are longer than 50 Mm to have a diameter of about 2 arcsec or
1.5 Mm, consistent with previous observations. However, Hi-C really resolves
these loops with some 20 pixels across the loop. Even at this greatly improved
spatial resolution the large loops seem to have no visible sub-structure.
Instead they show a smooth variation in cross-section. The fact that the large
coronal loops do not show a sub-structure at the spatial scale of 0.1 arcsec
per pixel implies that either the densities and temperatures are smoothly
varying across these loops or poses an upper limit on the diameter of strands
the loops might be composed of. We estimate that strands that compose the 2
arcsec thick loop would have to be thinner than 15 km. The miniature loops we
find for the first time pose a challenge to be properly understood in terms of
modeling.

that probe cosmology using galaxies as a tracer for dark matter must be able to
accurately estimate the cosmological parameters without knowing the details of
galaxy formation a priori. We apply this reasoning to the method of obtaining
$\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$ from galaxy clustering combined with the
mass-to-number ratio of galaxy clusters. To test the sensitivity of this method
to variations due to galaxy formation, we consider several different models
applied to the same cosmological dark matter simulation. The cosmological

marginalizing over the parameters of the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD). We
find that for models where the galaxies can be well represented by a

explored analytically and numerically. Compared to the well-studied case of
sedimenting rigid rods, the introduction of filament compliance is shown to
cause a significant alteration in the long-time sedimentation orientation and
filament geometry. A model is developed by balancing viscous, elastic, and
gravitational forces in a slender-body theory for zero-Reynolds-number flows,
and the filament dynamics are characterized by a dimensionless
elasto-gravitation number. Filaments of both non-uniform and uniform
cross-sectional thickness are considered. In the weakly flexible regime, a
multiple-scale asymptotic expansion is used to obtain expressions for filament
translations, rotations, and shapes. These are shown to match excellently with
full numerical simulations. Furthermore, we show that trajectories of
sedimenting flexible filaments, unlike their rigid counterparts, are restricted
to a cloud whose envelope is determined by the elasto-gravitation number. In
the highly flexible regime we show that a filament sedimenting along its long
axis is susceptible to a buckling instability. A linear stability analysis
provides a dispersion relation, illustrating clearly the competing effects of
the compressive stress and the restoring elastic force in the buckling process.
The instability travels as a wave along the filament opposite the direction of
gravity as it grows and the predicted growth rates are shown to compare
favorably with numerical simulations. The linear eigenmodes of the governing
equation are also studied, which agree well with the finite-amplitude buckled
shapes arising in simulations.

which is close to the lower limit at which the X-shape can be detected. No
coherent signature of an X-shape can be found in Galactocentric azimuthal
velocities, vertical velocities, or any of the dispersions. After scaling our
simulations, we find that a best fit to the BRAVA data leads to a bar angle of
15{\deg}. We also explore a purely geometric method for determining the
distance to the Galactic Centre by tracing the arms of the X-shape. We find
that we are able to determine this ill-known distance to an accuracy of about
5% per cent with sufficiently accurate distance measurements for the red clump

$\Phi $ is a metric independent density. For scale invariance a dilaton field
$\phi$ is considered. Using the first order formalism, curvature ($\Phi R$ and
$\sqrt{-g}R^{2}$) terms, gauge field term($\Phi\sqrt {- F_{\mu \nu}^{a}\,
F^{a}_{\alpha\beta}g^{\mu\alpha}g^{\nu\beta}}$ and $\sqrt{-g} F_{\mu \nu}^{a}\,
F^{a}_{\alpha\beta}g^{\mu\alpha}g^{\nu\beta}$) and dilaton kinetic terms are
introduced in a conformally invariant way. Exponential potentials for the
dilaton break down (softly) the conformal invariance down to global scale
invariance, which also suffers s.s.b. after integrating the equations of
motion. The model has a well defined flat space limit. As a result of the
s.s.b. of scale invariance phases with different vacuum energy density appear.
Inside the bags the gauge dynamics is normal, that is non confining, while for
the outside, the gauge field dynamics is confining.

small-scale dark matter clustering and of cosmic reionization. They exhibit
structural and chemical continuity with dwarf irregular galaxies in the field
and with spheroidal galaxies in high-density environments. By combining
empirical constraints derived for star formation at low gas column densities
and metallicities in the local universe with a model for dark matter and
baryonic mass assembly, we provide an analytical description of how the dwarf
spheroidals acquired their stellar content. Their progenitors formed stars
until the gas content, initially reduced from the cosmic average by the thermal
pressure of the reionized intergalactic medium, was finally ram pressure
stripped during the progenitors' accretion on to the host galaxy. Dwarf
spheroidal satellites of differing luminosities seem to share very similar most
massive progenitor histories that reach thresholds for gas cooling by atomic
line emission at epochs at which the Lagrangian volume of the Local Group
should have been reionized. We hypothesize that dwarf spheroidals formed the
bulk of their stars in partially rotationally supported HI disks in a reionized
universe. This model provides an explanation for the ""common mass scale""
relation and reproduces the empirical luminosity-size and
luminosity-metallicity relations. Explosive feedback phenomena, such as
outflows driven by the concerted action of supernovae, need not have been
significant in the dwarf spheroidals' formation. We further speculate that the
true pre-reionization fossils should exhibit a structure distinct from that of
the dwarf spheroidals, e.g., in the form of dense isolated or nuclear star
clusters.

The
growth proceeds through the deposition of elementary cubes into inner corners.
After re-scaling by the characteristic size, the interface becomes
progressively more deterministic in the long-time limit. Utilizing known
results for the crystal growth inside a two-dimensional corner, we propose a
hyperbolic partial differential equation for the evolution of the limiting
shape. This equation is interpreted as a Hamilton-Jacobi equation which helps
in finding an analytical solution. Simulations of the growth process are in
excellent agreement with analytical predictions. We then study the evolution of
the sub-leading correction to the volume of the crystal, the asymptotic growth
of the variance of the volume of the crystal, and the total number of inner and
outer corners. We also show how to generalize the results to arbitrary spatial
dimension.

  Distribution","To appear at MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stt1071",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a new method to study the velocity distribution of galaxy
systems, the Hellinger Distance (HD) - designed for detecting departures from a
Gaussian velocity distribution. We define a relaxed galactic system as the one
with unimodal velocity distribution and a normality deviation below a critical
value (HD<0.05). In this work, we study the gaussian nature of the velocity
distribution of the Berlind group sample, and of the FoF groups from the
Millennium simulation. For the Berlind group sample (z<0.1), 67% of the systems
are classified as relaxed, while for the Millennium sample we find 63% (z=0).
We verify that in multimodal groups the average mass of modes in high
multiplicity (N >= 20) systems are significantly larger than in low
multiplicity ones (N<20), suggesting that groups experience a mass growth at an
increasing virialization rate towards z=0, with larger systems accreting more
massive subunits. We also investigate the connection between galaxy properties
([Fe/H], Age, eClass, g-r, R_petro and <mu_petro>) and the gaussianity of the
velocity distribution of the groups. Bright galaxies (M_r <=-20.7) residing in
the inner and outer regions of groups, do not show significant differences in
the listed quantities regardless if the group has a Gaussian (G) or a
Non-Gaussian (NG) velocity distribution. However, the situation is
significantly different when we examine the faint galaxies (-20.7<M_r<=-17.9).
In G groups, there is a remarkable difference between the galaxy properties of
the inner and outer galaxy populations, testifying how the environment is
affecting the galaxies. Instead, in NG groups there is no segregation between
the properties of galaxies in the inner and outer regions, showing that the
properties of these galaxies still reflect the physical processes prevailing in
the environment where they were found earlier.

scattering experiments, we show that a spin-1 exchange model, supplemented by a
single-ion spin anisotropy, accounts well for the experimentally observed low
temperature magnetic phase diagram, that exhibits a commensurate bicollinear
order at low Fe dopings (y < 0.12) and an incommensurate spin-spiral order at
high Fe dopings (y > 0.12). We suggest that the commensurate-incommensurate
transition at y = 0.12 is due to the competition between the exchange
interaction and the local spin anisotropy. At low Fe dopings, the single-ion
spin anisotropy is strong and pins the spins along the easy axis, which,
together with the spatially anisotropic exchanges, induces a unusual
bicollinear commensurate magnetic order. The low-energy spin-wave excitation is
gapped due to the explict breaking of spin-rotational symmetry by the local
spin anisotropy. At high Fe dopings, the single-ion anisotropy is weak, and the
exchange favors an incommensurate coplanar state. The incommensurate magnetic
wavevector averages out the spin anisotropy so that a gapless low-energy
spin-wave excitation is obtained. We also analyze the low-energy hydrodynamic
model and use it to describe the magneto-structural transition and the static
and dynamical spin structure factors across the magnetic ordering transitions.

Planck satellite point toward a Hubble constant that is in tension with that
measured by gravitational lens time delays and by the local distance ladder.
Prosaically, this difference could arise from unknown systematic uncertainties
in some of the measurements. More interestingly -- if systematics were ruled
out -- resolving the tension would require a departure from the flat Lambda-CDM
cosmology, introducing for example a modest amount of spatial curvature, or a
non-trivial dark energy equation of state. To begin to address these issues, we
present here an analysis of the gravitational lens RXJ1131-1231 that is
improved in one particular regard: we examine the issue of systematic error
introduced by an assumed lens model density profile. We use more flexible
gravitational lens models with baryonic and dark matter components, and find
that the exquisite Hubble Space Telescope image with thousands of intensity
pixels in the Einstein ring and the stellar velocity dispersion of the lens
contain sufficient information to constrain these more flexible models. The
total uncertainty on the time-delay distance is 6.6% for a single system. We
proceed to combine our improved time-delay distance measurements with the WMAP9
and Planck posteriors. In an open Lambda-CDM model, the data for RXJ1131-1231
in combination with Planck favor a flat universe with Omega_k = 0.00+0.01/-0.02

state-of-the-art solvers for a wide range of problems. This paper presents a
parallelization of HCM for a shared memory architecture. The numerical
experiments in $R^3$ show that the parallel HCM exhibits good algorithmic
behavior and scales well, resulting in a very fast and practical solver.
  We further explore the influence on performance and scaling of data
precision, early termination criteria, and the hardware architecture. A shorter
version of this manuscript (omitting these more detailed tests) has been
submitted to SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing in 2012.

possible to detect events which are characterized not by motion, but by the
changing state of the people or objects involved. This is accomplished by using
object detectors as output models for the states of a hidden Markov model
(HMM). The method allows an HMM to model the sequence of poses of the event
participants over time, and is effective for poses of humans and inanimate
objects. The ability to use existing object-detection methods as part of an
event model makes it possible to leverage ongoing work in the object-detection
community. A novel training method uses an EM loop to simultaneously learn the
temporal structure and object models automatically, without the need to specify
either the individual poses to be modeled or the frames in which they occur.
The E-step estimates the latent assignment of video frames to HMM states, while
the M-step estimates both the HMM transition probabilities and state output
models, including the object detectors, which are trained on the weighted
subset of frames assigned to their state. A new dataset was gathered because
little work has been done on events characterized by changing object pose, and
suitable datasets are not available. Our method produced results superior to
that of comparison systems on this dataset.

contained in a sparse signal can be preserved in a small number of compressive,

have been established concerning the embedding of a sparse signal family under
a random measurement operator and on the accuracy to which sparse signals can
be recovered from noisy compressive measurements. In this paper, we address
similar questions in the context of a different modeling framework. Instead of
sparse models, we focus on the broad class of manifold models, which can arise
in both parametric and non-parametric signal families. Using tools from the
theory of empirical processes, we improve upon previous results concerning the
embedding of low-dimensional manifolds under random measurement operators. We
also establish both deterministic and probabilistic instance-optimal bounds in
$\ell_2$ for manifold-based signal recovery and parameter estimation from noisy
compressive measurements. In line with analogous results for sparsity-based CS,
we conclude that much stronger bounds are possible in the probabilistic

number of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) within the central parsec of the Galactic

millisecond pulsars in globular clusters accelerate leptons in their wind zones

because a coordinate can be recovered by accessing at most $r$ other

coordinates accessed for recovery are also erased.
  To overcome this problem, we propose the $(r,\delta)_c$-locality providing
$\delta -1$ local repair options for a coordinate. Consequently, the repair
locality $r$ can tolerate $\delta-1$ erasures in total. We derive an upper
bound on the minimum distance $d$ for any linear $[n,k]$ code with information
$(r,\delta)_c$-locality. For general parameters, we prove existence of the
codes that attain this bound when $n\geq k(r(\delta-1)+1)$, implying tightness
of this bound. Although the locality $(r,\delta)$ defined by Prakash et al
provides the same level of locality and local repair tolerance as our
definition, codes with $(r,\delta)_c$-locality are proved to have more
advantage in the minimum distance. In particular, we construct a class of codes
with all symbol $(r,\delta)_c$-locality where the gain in minimum distance is
$\Omega(\sqrt{r})$ and the information rate is close to 1.

with a similar reduction in ELM energy loss. A threshold current for ELM
mitigation is observed above which the ELM frequency increases approximately
linearly with current in the coils. A comparison of the filament structures
observed during the ELMs in the natural and mitigated stages shows that the
mitigated ELMs have the characteristics of type I ELMs even though their
frequency is higher, their energy loss is reduced and the pedestal pressure

observed in visible-light imaging of the X-point region. The size of these

contributions are often required. From the perspective of each individual,
however, it is advantageous not to volunteer such contributions, in the hope
that other individuals will carry the associated costs. This conflict can be
modeled as a volunteer's dilemma. To encourage rational individuals to make
voluntary contributions, a government or other social organizations can offer
rewards, to be shared among the volunteers. Here we apply such shared rewarding
to the generalized volunteer's dilemma, in which a threshold number of
volunteers is required for producing the public good. By means of theoretical
and numerical analyses, we show that without shared rewarding only two
evolutionary outcomes are possible: full defection or coexistence of volunteers
and non-volunteers. We show that already small rewards destabilize full
defection, stabilizing small fractions of volunteers instead. Furthermore, at
these intermediate reward levels, we find a hysteresis effect such that
increasing or decreasing group sizes can trigger different social outcomes. In
particular, when group size is increased, the fraction of volunteers first
increases gradually before jumping up abruptly; when group size is then
decreased again, the fraction of volunteers not only remains high, but even
continues to increase. As the shared reward is increased beyond a critical
level, the bi-stability underlying this hysteresis effect vanishes altogether,
and only a single social outcome remains, corresponding to the stable
coexistence of volunteers and non-volunteers. We find that this critical level
of shared rewarding is relatively small compared to the total cost of
contributing to the public good. These results show that the introduction of
shared rewarding is remarkably effective in overcoming defection traps in the
generalized volunteer's dilemma.

multistability in strongly-coupled semiconductor microcavities shows that the

optical/UV/X-ray spectrum is consistent with being dominated by a standard disc
component. This gives a best estimate for black hole spin which is low, with a
firm upper limit of $a_*<0.86$. This contrasts with the recent X-ray
determinations of (close to) maximal black hole spin in other NLS1 based on
relativistic smearing of the iron profile. While our data on PG1244+026 does
not have sufficient statistics at high energy to give a good measure of black
hole spin from the iron line profile, cosmological simulations predict that
black holes with similar masses have similar growth histories and so should
have similar spins. This suggests that there is a problem either in our

potentially habitable Earth-like planets. These fields can reduce the size of
planetary magnetospheres to such an extent that a significant fraction of the
planet's atmosphere may be exposed to erosion by the stellar wind. We used a
sample of 15 active dM stars, for which surface magnetic-field maps were
reconstructed, to determine the magnetic pressure at the planet orbit and hence
the largest size of its magnetosphere, which would only be decreased by
considering the stellar wind. Our method provides a fast means to assess which
planets are most affected by the stellar magnetic field. We show that
hypothetical Earth-like planets with similar terrestrial magnetisation (1G)
orbiting at the inner (outer) edge of the habitable zone of these stars would
present magnetospheres that extend at most up to 6 (11.7) planetary radii. To
be able to sustain an Earth-sized magnetosphere, with the exception of only a
few cases, the terrestrial planet would either (1) need to orbit significantly
farther out than the traditional limits of the habitable zone; or else, (2) if
it were orbiting within the habitable zone, it would require at least a
magnetic field ranging from a few G to up to a few thousand G. By assuming a
magnetospheric size that is more appropriate for the young-Earth (3.4Gyr ago),
the required planetary magnetic fields are one order of magnitude weaker.
However, in this case, the polar-cap area of the planet, which is unprotected
from transport of particles to/from interplanetary space, is twice as large. As
the star becomes older and, therefore, its rotation rate and magnetic field
reduce, the interplanetary magnetic pressure decreases and the magnetosphere of
planets probably expands. Using an empirically derived

the validity of the Marcus theory of electron transfer. Here we study the
implications of this property on the non-linear transport properties of such
junctions. We obtain an analytical solution of the integral equations that
describe molecular conduction in the Marcus kinetic regime and use it in
different physical limits to predict some important features of nonlinear
transport in metal-molecule-metal junctions. In particular, conduction,
rectification and negative differential resistance can be obtained in different
regimes of interplay between two different conduction channels associated with
different localization properties of the excess molecular charge, without
specific assumptions about the electronic structure of the molecular bridge.
The predicted behaviors show temperature dependences typically observed in the

displacement and an enriched shear flexible 4-noded quadrilateral element is
used for the spatial discretization. The formulation takes into account the
transverse shear deformation and accounts for the lamina material properties at
elevated moisture concentrations and temperature. The influence of the plate
geometry, the geometry of the cutout, the moisture concentration, the thermal
gradient and the boundary conditions on the free flexural vibration is

junctions that account for recent observations of nonlinear charge transport
phenomena, such as hysteresis and hysteretic negative differential resistance
(NDR). A defining feature in such models is the involvement of at least two
conduction channels - a slow channel that determines transitions between charge
states of the bridge and a fast channel that dominates its conduction. Using
Marcus theory of heterogeneous electron transfer (ET) at metal-molecule
interfaces we identify and describe different regimes of nonlinear conduction
through redox molecular bridges, where the transferring charge can be highly
localized around the redox moiety. This localization and its stabilization by
polarization of the surrounding medium and/or conformational changes can lead
to decoupling of the current response dynamics from the timescale of the
voltage sweep (that is, the current does not adiabatically follow the voltage),
hence to the appearance of memory (thermodynamic irreversibility) in this
response that is manifested by hysteresis in current-voltage cycles. In
standard voltammetry such irreversibility leads to relative shift of the
current peaks along the forward and backward voltage sweeps. The common origin
of these behaviors is pointed out and expressions of the threshold voltage
sweep rates are provided. In addition, the theory is extended (a) to analyze
the different ways by which such phenomena are manifested in single sweep
cycles and in ensemble averages of such cycles, and (b) to examine quantum
effects in the fast transport channel.

(FWHM~70-100 km/s) and narrow (<50 km/s) components. The broad components are
found close to the edges of both pillars, suggesting that they originate in
turbulent mixing layers (TMLs) driven by the effect of the star cluster wind.
Both pillars exhibit surprisingly high ionized gas densities of >10000 cm-3. In
one pillar we found that these high densities are only found in the narrow
component, implying it must originate from deeper within the pillar than the
broad component. From this, together with our kinematical data, we conclude
that the narrow component traces a photoevaporation flow, and that the TML
forms at the interface with the hot wind. On the pillar surfaces we find a
consistent offset in radial velocity between the narrow (brighter) components
of H-alpha and [NII] of ~5-8 km/s, for which we were unable to find a
satisfactory explanation. We urge the theoretical community to simulate

Our most crucial result is we have not found any $\ln (N)$ dependence of the
average relaxation time $\langle T(\sigma,N) \rangle$ in the precritical state.
The other results are: (i) The critical load $\sigma_c(N)$ for the bundle of
size $N$ approaches its asymptotic value $\sigma_c(\infty)$ as $\sigma_c(N) =
\sigma_c(\infty) + AN^{-1/\nu}$. (ii) Right at the critical point the average
relaxation time $\langle T(\sigma_c(N),N) \rangle$ scales with the bundle size
$N$ as: $\langle T(\sigma_c(N),N) \rangle \sim N^{\eta}$ and this behavior
remains valid within a small window of size $|\Delta \sigma| \sim N^{-\zeta}$
around the critical point. (iii) When $1/N < |\Delta \sigma| < 100N^{-\zeta}$
the finite-size scaling takes the form: $\langle T(\sigma,N) \rangle / N^{\eta}
\sim {\cal G}[\{\sigma_c(N)-\sigma\}N^{\zeta}]$ so that in the limit of $N \to
\infty$ one has $\langle T(\sigma) \rangle \sim (\sigma - \sigma_c)^{-\tau}$.
  The high precision of our numerical estimates led us to verify that $\nu =

a highly relativistic spine outflow is surrounded by a wider and less
relativistic sheath outflow. Thermal photons are injected in regions of high
optical depth and propagated until they escape at the photosphere. Due to the
presence of shear in velocity (Lorentz factor) at the boundary of the spine and
sheath region, a fraction of the injected photons are accelerated via a
Fermi-like acceleration mechanism such that a high energy power-law tail is
formed in the resultant spectrum. We show, in particular, that if a velocity
shear with a considerable variance in the bulk Lorentz factor is present, the
high energy part of observed Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) photon spectrum can be
explained by this photon acceleration mechanism. We also show that the
accelerated photons may also account for the origin of the extra hard power-law
component above the bump of the thermal-like peak seen in some peculiar bursts
(e.g., GRB 090510, 090902B, 090926A). It is demonstrated that time-integrated
spectra can also reproduce the low energy spectrum of GRBs consistently due to
a multi-temperature effect when time evolution of the outflow is considered.
Finally, we show that the empirical Ep-Lp relation can be explained by
differences in the outflow properties of individual sources.

ultraluminous accretion state. It is also relatively highly absorbed for a ULX,

line-of-sight column in our Galaxy. Although its X-ray spectra are well
represented by accretion disc models, its variability characteristics argue
against this interpretation. The ULX spectra instead appear dominated by a
cool, optically-thick Comptonising corona. We discuss how the measured 9 per
cent rms variability and a hardening of the spectrum as its flux diminishes
might be reconciled with the effects of a very massive, radiatively-driven
wind, and subtle changes in the corona respectively. We speculate that the cool
disc-like spectral component thought to be produced by the wind in other ULXs

other than its extreme X-ray luminosity, for the presence of an intermediate

  The first author has conjectured that a primitive group synchronizes any map

namely, degree $n$ primitive groups synchronize maps of rank $n-1$ (thus, maps
with kernel type $(2,1,\ldots,1)$). We prove some extensions of Rystsov's

transformation semigroup fails to contain a constant map if and only if it is

spectrum. This calls for a few percent SASE bandwidth, resulting in an increase
in the number of indexed images at the same number of hits. Based on
start-to-end simulations for the baseline of the European XFEL, we demonstrate
here that it is possible to achieve up to a tenfold increase in SASE bandwidth,
compared with the nominal mode of operation. This provides a route for further
increasing the efficiency of protein structure determination at the European
XFEL. We illustrate this concept with simulations of lysozyme nanocrystals.

the one-sided Lipschitz condition (OSLC): Lax-Friedrichs, Engquist-Osher and
Godunov. We mainly focus on the inviscid Burgers equation, for which we know
that the large time behavior is of self-similar nature, described by a
two-parameter family of N-waves. We prove that, at the numerical level, the
large time dynamics depends on the amount of numerical viscosity introduced by
the scheme: while Engquist-Osher and Godunov yield the same N-wave asymptotic
behavior, the Lax-Friedrichs scheme leads to viscous self-similar profiles,
corresponding to the asymptotic behavior of the solutions of the continuous
viscous Burgers equation. The same problem is analyzed in the context of
self-similar variables that lead to a better numerical performance but to the
same dichotomy on the asymptotic behavior: N-waves versus viscous ones. We also
give some hints to extend the results to more general fluxes. Some numerical
experiments illustrating the accuracy of the results of the paper are also

geological formations identified in the geological map at scale 1:10,000. The
non-dependency of the estimated results from the random numbering process has
been tested for three distinct models. The experimental cross-semivariograms
constructed for radioelement-geology couples show well-defined co-variability
structures for both direct and crossed variograms. The high statistical
correlations among K, eU, and eTh measurements are confirmed also by the same
maximum distance of spatial autocorrelation. Combining the smoothing effects of
probabilistic interpolator and the abrupt discontinuities of the geological
map, the results show a distinct correlation between the geological formation
and radioactivity content. The contour of Mt. Capanne pluton can be
distinguished by high K, eU and eTh abundances, while different degrees of
radioactivity content identify the tectonic units. A clear anomaly of high K
content in the Mt. Calamita promontory confirms the presence of felsic dykes
and hydrothermal veins not reported in our geological map. Although we assign a
unique number to each geological formation, the method shows that the internal
variability of the radiometric data is not biased by the multivariate

potential strength if the persistence length of the polymer matches the range
of the adsorption potential. On curved substrates, i.e., an adsorbing sphere or
an adsorbing washboard surface, the adsorption can be additionally controlled
by the curvature of the surface structure. The additional bending energy in the
adsorbed state leads to an increase of the critical adsorption strength, which
depends on the curvature radii of the substrate structure. For an adsorbing
sphere, this gives rise to an optimal polymer stiffness for adsorption, i.e., a
local minimum in the critical potential strength for adsorption, which can be
controlled by curvature. For two- and three-dimensional washboard substrates,
we identify the range of persistence lengths and the mechanisms for an
effective control of the adsorption threshold by the substrate curvature.

degrade the network's Quality of Service (QoS). To this end, a new
network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS) is proposed. Most contemporary
NIDSs take a passive approach by solely monitoring the network's production
traffic. This paper explores a complementary approach in which distributed
agents actively send out periodic probes. The probes are continuously monitored
to detect anomalous behavior of the network. The proposed approach takes away
much of the variability of the network's production traffic that makes it so
difficult to classify. This enables the NIDS to detect more subtle attacks
which would not be detected using the passive approach alone. Furthermore, the
active probing approach allows the NIDS to be effectively trained using only
examples of the network's normal states, hence enabling an effective detection
of zero-day attacks. Using realistic experiments, we show that an NIDS which
also leverages the active approach is considerably more effective in detecting
attacks which aim to degrade the network's QoS when compared to an NIDS which
relies solely on the passive approach. Lastly, we show that the false positives
rate remains very low even in the face of Byzantine faults.

exhibit localised barren patches of vegetation called fairy circles. They
consist of isolated or randomly distributed circular areas devoid of any
vegetation. They are surrounded by fringes of tall grasses and are embedded in
a sparse grassland on sandy soils. When the aridity increases, the size of the
fairy circles increases and can reach diameters up to 10m. Although several
hypotheses have been proposed, the origin of this phenomenon remains unsolved.
We show that a simple non-local model of plant ecology based on realistic
assumptions provides a quantitative explanation of this phenomenon. Fairy
circles result from strong interaction between interfaces connecting two
uniform covers: the uniform grassland and the bare states, and their
stabilisation is attributed to the Lorentzian-like non-local coupling that
models the competition between plants. The cause of their formation in thus
rather inherent to the vegetation dynamics. Our analysis explain how a circular
shape and fringes are formed, and how the aridity level influences the size of
the fairy circles. In agreement with field observation, these theoretical
findings, provide a link between a strong non-local interaction of plants and
the formation of stable fairy circles. Finally, we show that the proposed
mechanism is model-independent: indeed, it also applies to the
reaction-diffusion type of model that emphasises the influence of water
transport on the vegetation dynamics.

states. I introduce relativistic quantum field theory with field quantisation,
and the definition and transformations of mode functions in Minkowski,
Schwarzschild and Rindler spaces. I introduce information theory by discussing
the nature of information, defining the entropic information measures, and
highlighting the differences between classical and quantum information. I
review the field of relativistic quantum information. We investigate the
communication abilities of an inertial observer to a relativistic observer
hovering above a Schwarzschild black hole, using the Rindler approximation. We
compare both classical communication and quantum entanglement generation of the
state merging protocol, for both the single and dual rail encodings. We find
that while classical communication remains finite right up to the horizon, the
quantum entanglement generation tends to zero. We investigate the observers'
abilities to precisely measure the parameter of a state that is communicated
between Alice and Rob. This parameter was encoded to either the amplitudes of a
single excitation state or the phase of a NOON state. With NOON states the dual
rail encoding provided greater precision, which is different to the results for
the other situations. The precision was maximum for a particular number of
excitations in the NOON state. We calculated the bipartite communication for
Alice-Rob and Alice-AntiRob beyond the single mode approximation. Rob and
AntiRob are causally disconnected counter-accelerating observers. We found that
Alice must choose in advance with whom, Rob or AntiRob she wants to create
entanglement using a particular setup. She could communicate classically to
both.

sequential process that could by itself be described by a simple master

pseudoparticle non-equilibrium Green function method to that obtained from an
approximate mixed quantum-classical calculation, where correlations between the

marked deviations from the full quantum results only at the threshold for

range of temperatures. The new rates are further linked to a complex chemical
network that shows the evolution in time of the CH+ abundance in
photodissociation region (PDR) and molecular cloud (MC) environments.
  The evolutionary abundances of CH+ are given by numerical solutions of a
large set of coupled, first-order kinetics equations by employing the new
chemical package KROME. The differences found between all existing calculations
from low-T experiments are explained via a simple numerical model that links
the low-T cross section reductions to collinear approaches where nonadiabatic
crossings dominate. The analysis of evolutionary abundance of CH+ reveals that
the important region for the depletion reaction of this study is that above 100
K, hence showing that, at least for this reaction, the differences with the
existing low-temperature experiments are of essentially no importance within
the astrochemical environments. A detailed analysis of the chemical network
involving CH+ also shows that a slight decrease in the initial oxygen abundance
might lead to higher CH+ abundance since the main chemical carbon ion depletion
channel is reduced in efficiency. This simplified observation might provide an
alternative starting point to understand the problem of astrochemical models in
matching the observed CH+ abundances.

use in numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution. These curves
depend on only five parameters: temperature, density, redshift, [Fe/H], and
[Mg/Fe]. They are easily tabulated and can be efficiently interpolated during a
simulation.
  The ionization equilibrium of 14 key elements is determined for temperatures
between 10K and 10^9K and densities up to 100 amu/cm^3 taking into account
collisional and radiative ionization, by the cosmic UV background and an
interstellar radiation field, and by charge-transfer reactions. These elements,
ranging from H to Ni, are the ones most abundantly produced and/or released by
SNIa, SNII, and intermediate-mass stars. Self-shielding of the gas at high
densities by neutral Hydrogen is taken into account in an approximate way by
exponentially suppressing the H-ionizing part of the cosmic UV background for
HI densities above a threshold density of n_HI,crit=0.007 cm^-3. We discuss how
the ionization equilibrium, and the cooling and heating curves depend on the
physical properties of the gas.
  The main advantage of the work presented here is that, within the confines of
a well-defined chemical evolution model and adopting the ionization equilibrium
approximation, it provides accurate cooling and heating curves for a wide range
of physical and chemical gas properties, including the effects of
self-shielding. The latter is key to resolving the formation of cold, neutral,

about the statistical correlation between Z and C and about the behaviour of
the mixture fraction, as required in previous FPV models. In fact, for
state-of-the-art models, with the assumption of very-fast-chemistry,Z is widely
accepted to behave as a passive scalar characterized by a $\beta$-distribution
function. Instead, the model proposed here, evaluates the most probable joint
distribution of Z and C without any assumption on their behaviour and provides
an effective tool to verify the adequateness of widely used hypotheses, such as
their statistical independence. The model is validated versus three well-known
test cases, namely, the Sandia flames. The results are compared with those
obtained by the standard FPV approach, analysing the role of the PDF functional

larger than the phase transition threshold studied in Baik, Ben Arous and Peche

show that the asymptotic power of the Tracy-Widom-type tests is trivial (i.e.,

both fundamental and practical interest. A mathematical model formulated by
Gaver and Grotberg 1990 describing the spreading of a single layer of insoluble
surfactant has become widely accepted, and several experiments on axisymmetric
spreading have confirmed its predictions for both the height profile of the
free surface and the spreading exponent (the radius of the circular area
covered by surfactant grows as t^{1/4}). However, these prior experiments have
primarily utilized surfactant quantities exceeding (sometimes far exceeding) a
monolayer. In this paper, we report that this regime is characterized by a
mismatch between the timescales of the experiment and model, and additionally
find that the spatial distribution of surfactant molecules differs
substantially from the model prediction. For experiments performed in the
monolayer regime for which the model was developed, the surfactant layer is
observed to have a spreading exponent of less than 1/10, far below the
predicted value, and the surfactant distribution is also in disagreement. These
findings suggest that the model is inadequate for describing the spreading of
insoluble surfactants on thin fluid layers.

Co-reference normalization unifies several written forms of the same named

phrase selection precludes a true ""Gold Standard"", we used Amazon's Mechanical

polymer is made of a succession of long vertical stretches that attract each
other to form a unique macroscopic bead, we identify the horizontal extension
of the random walk inside the collapsed phase and we establish the convergence
of the rescaled envelope of the macroscopic bead towards a deterministic Wulff

provides an effective route for preparation of stable glasses, whose properties
correspond in some cases to those expected for glasses that have been aged for
thousands of years. In this work, model binary glasses are prepared in a
process inspired by physical vapor deposition, in which particles are
sequentially added to the free surface of a growing film. The resulting glasses
are shown to be more stable than those prepared by gradual cooling from the
liquid phase. However, it is also shown that the composition of the resulting
glass, which is difficult to control in physical vapor deposition simulations
of thin films, plays a significant role on the physical characteristics of the
material. That composition dependence leads to a re- evaluation of previous
results from simulations of thinner films than those considered here, where the
equivalent age of the corresponding glasses was overestimated. The simulations
presented in this work, which correspond to films that are approximately 38
molecular diameters thick, also enable analysis of the devitrification
mechanism of vapor-deposited glasses. Consistent with experiments, it is found
that this mechanism consists of a mobility front that propagates from the free
interface into the interior of the films. Eliminating surface mobility
eliminates this route of transformation into the supercooled liquid.

longevity of metallicity gradients in simulated dwarf galaxies. Specifically,
we investigate the role of potentially orbit-changing processes such as radial
stellar migration and dynamical heating in shaping or destroying these
gradients. We also consider the influence of the star formation density
threshold, investigating both a low and high value (0.1 amu/$cm^{3}$ - 100
amu/$cm^{3}$).
  The Nbody-SPH models that we use to self-consistently form and evolve dwarf
galaxies in isolation show that, in the absence of significant angular
momentum, metallicity gradients are gradually built up during the evolution of
the dwarf galaxy, by ever more centrally concentrated star formation adding to
the overall gradient. Once formed, they are robust, survive easily in the
absence of external disturbances and hardly decline over several Gyr, and they
agree well with observed metallicity gradients of dwarf galaxies in the Local
Group. The underlying orbital displacement of stars is quite limited in our
models, being of the order of only fractions of the half light radius over
time-spans of 5 to 10 Gyr in all star formation schemes. This is contrary to
the strong radial migration found in massive disc galaxies, caused by
scattering of stars off the corotation resonance of spiral structures. In the
dwarf regime the stellar body only seems to undergo mild dynamical heating, due
to the lack of long-lived spiral structures and/or discs.
  The density threshold has profound influences on the star formation mode of
the models, but only a minor influence on the evolution of metallicity
gradients. Increasing the threshold 1000-fold causes comparatively stronger
dynamical heating of the stellar body due to the increased turbulence and the
scattering of stars off dense gas clouds, but the effect remains very limited
in absolute terms.

analysis (ICA) of multivariate data. We propose methodology for estimating and
testing the existence of mutually independent components for a given dataset,
and a versatile resampling-based procedure for inference. Independent
components are estimated by combining a nonparametric probability integral
transformation with a generalized nonparametric whitening method that
simultaneously minimizes all forms of dependence among the components.
U-statistics of certain Euclidean distances between sample elements are
combined in succession to construct a statistic for testing the existence of
mutually independent components. The proposed measures and tests are based on
both necessary and sufficient conditions for mutual independence. When
independent components exist, one may apply univariate analysis to study or
model each component separately. Univariate models may then be combined to
obtain a multivariate model for the original observations. We prove the
consistency of our estimator under minimal regularity conditions without
assuming the existence of independent components a priori, and all assumptions
are placed on the observations directly, not on the latent components. We
demonstrate the improvements of the proposed method over competing methods in
simulation studies. We apply the proposed ICA approach to two real examples and
contrast it with principal component analysis.

temperature fluctuations also depend on the initial state of inflation. Here,
we examine to what extent these observables are affected by our ignorance in
the initial condition for inflationary perturbations, due to unknown new
physics at a high scale $M$. For initial states that satisfy constraints from
backreaction, we find that the amplitude of the power spectra could still be
significantly altered, while the modification in bispectrum remains small. For
such initial states, $M$ has an upper bound of a few tens of $H$, with $H$
being the Hubble parameter during inflation. We show that for $M\sim 20 H$,
such initial states always (substantially) suppress the tensor to scalar ratio.

capacity zero for that period. A set of arcs is designated to have maintenance
during the planning period, which will require each to be shut down for exactly
one time period. In general this problem is known to be NP-hard. Here we
identify a number of characteristics that are relevant for the complexity of
instance classes. In particular, we discuss instances with restrictions on the
set of arcs that have maintenance to be scheduled; series parallel networks;
capacities that are balanced, in the sense that the total capacity of arcs
entering a (non-terminal) node equals the total capacity of arcs leaving the
node; and identical capacities on all arcs.

supermassive black hole at the centre of the Galaxy. With this scenario in
mind, it has recently been proposed by Bartos et al. (arXiv:1302.3220) that,
prior to its perinigricon, G2 will likely experience multiple encounters with
members of the black hole and neutron-star populations believed to orbit near
the Galactic Centre. Here, we further explore this possibility and study the
general case for collisions with the G2 object using the latest orbital
solutions provided by Phifer et al. (arXiv:1304.5280) and Gillessen et al.,
(arXiv:1306.1374) and a Monte Carlo approach to estimate the minimum orbit
intersection distance (MOID) with G2 as a function of the orbital parameters of
the incoming body. Our results indicate that encounters at distances closer
than 100 au started to become statistically significant only during the last
few years or so. MOIDs under 100 au are statistically more probable for the
most dynamically cold orbits. If there is a population of objects moving in
low-inclination, low-eccentricity orbits around the central black hole, the
highest probability for a close encounter with G2 is found to be in the period
2014 January-March but enhanced activity due to encounters may start as early

conditions. The periods of two clocks can be compared with each other via two

inertial frame. Dimensional arguments and a detailed deduction show that the
period of a rotating clock, measured externally in the inertial system, is the
same as the internally defined one. There is a common synchron-time, especially
'absolute' simultaneity and invariance of flight times hold. This allows a new
discussion of the twin problem. The invariance of a rotating circle allows the
transference of the inertial polar coordinates to the rotating plane. The
flight time of a light pulse obeys a generalized Fermat's principle. If rays

methods will be discussed in this study. The mostly used methods are Euler,

applications of these methods to constant and identity functions will be given

methods given as fractional order derivatives are curve fitting methods or
curve approximation methods. In this paper, we redefined fractional order
derivative (FOD) by using classical derivative definition and L Hospital
method, since classical derivative definition concluded in indefinite limit
such as 0/0. The obtained definition is same as classical derivative definition
in case of fractional order is equal to 1. This implies that definitions and
theorems in this paper sound and complete.

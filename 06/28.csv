problem, different methods have been proposed and justified by establishing
exact convergence rates for the classification risk, as well as the l2
convergence results to the discriminative rule. However, sharp theoretical
analysis for the variable selection performance of these procedures have not
been established, even though model interpretation is of fundamental importance
in scientific data analysis. This paper bridges the gap by providing sharp
sufficient conditions for consistent variable selection using the sparse
discriminant analysis (Mai et al., 2012). Through careful analysis, we
establish rates of convergence that are significantly faster than the best
known results and admit an optimal scaling of the sample size n, dimensionality
p, and sparsity level s in the high-dimensional setting. Sufficient conditions
are complemented by the necessary information theoretic limits on the variable
selection problem in the context of high-dimensional discriminant analysis.
Exploiting a numerical equivalence result, our method also establish the
optimal results for the ROAD estimator (Fan et al., 2012) and the sparse
optimal scaling estimator (Clemmensen et al., 2011). Furthermore, we analyze an
exhaustive search procedure, whose performance serves as a benchmark, and show
that it is variable selection consistent under weaker conditions. Extensive
simulations demonstrating the sharpness of the bounds are also provided.

Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stt1198",,"astro-ph.SR astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In old, dense stellar systems collisions of white dwarfs are a rather
frequent phenomenon. Here we present the results of a comprehensive set of
Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics simulations of close encounters of white dwarfs
aimed to explore the outcome of the interaction and the nature of the final
remnants for different initial conditions. Depending on the initial conditions
and the white dwarf masses, three different outcomes are possible.
Specifically, the outcome of the interaction can be either a direct or a
lateral collision or the interaction can result in the formation of an
eccentric binary system. In those cases in which a collision occurs, the
infalling material is compressed and heated such that the physical conditions
for a detonation may be reached during the most violent phases of the merger.
While we find that detonations occur in a significant number of our
simulations, in some of them the temperature increase in the shocked region
rapidly lifts degeneracy, leading to the quenching of the burning. We thus
characterize under which circumstances a detonation is likely to occur as a
result of the impact of the disrupted star on the surface of the more massive
white dwarf. Finally, we also study which interactions result in bound systems,
and in which ones the more massive white dwarf is also disrupted as a
consequence of the dynamical interaction. The sizable number of simulations
performed in this work allows to find how the outcome of the interaction
depends on the distance at closest approach, and on the masses of the colliding
white dwarfs, and which is the chemical pattern of the nuclearly processed
material. Finally, we also discuss the influence of the masses and core
chemical compositions of the interacting white dwarfs and the different kinds
of impact in the properties of the remnants.

B/S are compared with previous stellar and interstellar measurements in the

of the prediction of primary boron production from spallation processes.
Possible sources of contamination are discussed, as well as physical effects

implication of these measurements suggest potentially higher cosmic ray fluxes
in DLAs. The prospects for future boron detections in other high redshift DLAs

reproduced by self-consistent chemo-photometric infall models with continuous
star formation histories and no mass or metals loss. The model is characterized
by the total mass of primordial gas available to the object, its characteristic
collapse timescale, and a constant star formation efficiency. A grid of 144
such models has been computed by varying these parameters, and their
predictions (elemental abundances, stellar and gas masses, photometric colors)
have been compared with a set of observations of dIrr galaxies obtained from
the literature. It is found that the models with moderate to low efficiency are
able to reproduce most of the observational data, including the relative
abundances of nitrogen and oxygen.

certain matrix integrals. Capitalizing on that approach, we derive a new
expression for the probability density function (p.d.f.) of the joint
eigenvalues of a complex non-central Wishart matrix with a rank-1 mean. The
resulting functional form in turn enables us to use powerful classical
orthogonal polynomial techniques in solving three problems related to the
non-central Wishart matrix. To be specific, for an $n\times n$ complex
non-central Wishart matrix $\mathbf{W}$ with $m$ degrees of freedom ($m\geq n$)
and a rank-1 mean, we derive a new expression for the cumulative distribution
function (c.d.f.) of the minimum eigenvalue ($\lambda_{\min}$). The c.d.f. is
expressed as the determinant of a square matrix, the size of which depends only
on the difference $m-n$. This further facilitates the analysis of the
microscopic limit for the minimum eigenvalue which takes the form of the
determinant of a square matrix of size $m-n$ with the Bessel kernel. We also
develop a moment generating function based approach to derive the p.d.f. of the
random variable $\frac{\text{tr}(\mathbf{W})}{\lambda_{\min}}$, where
$\text{tr}(\cdot)$ denotes the trace of a square matrix. This random quantity
is of great importance in the so-called smoothed analysis of Demmel condition
number. Finally, we find the average of the reciprocal of the characteristic
polynomial $\det[z\mathbf{I}_n+\mathbf{W}],\; |\arg z|<\pi$, where
$\mathbf{I}_n$ and $\det[\cdot]$ denote the identity matrix of size $n$ and the
determinant, respectively.

interest because it lies between the Earth and Neptune in size and may be a
member of a new class of planet that is neither terrestrial nor gas giant. Its
relatively flat transmission spectrum has so far made atmospheric
characterisation difficult. The NEMESIS algorithm (Irwin et al. 2008) is used
to explore the degenerate model parameter space for a cloudy, H2-He-dominated
atmosphere scenario. Optimal estimation is a data-led approach that allows
solutions beyond the range permitted by ab initio equilibrium model atmosphere
calculations, and as such prevents restriction from prior expectations. We show
that optimal estimation retrieval is a powerful tool for this kind of study,
and present an exploration of the degenerate atmospheric scenarios for GJ
1214b. Whilst we find a family of solutions that provide a very good fit to the
data, the quality and coverage of these data are insufficient for us to more
precisely determine the abundances of cloud and trace gases given an H2-He
atmosphere, and we also cannot rule out the possibility of a high molecular
weight atmosphere. Future ground- and space-based observations will provide the
opportunity to confirm or rule out an extended H2-He atmosphere, but more
precise constraints will be limited by intrinsic degeneracies in the retrieval
problem, such as variations in cloud top pressure and temperature.

it to a spin and performing solely spin manipulations and measurements (Ramsey
Interferometry). We propose to use an optically levitated diamond bead
containing an NV center spin. The nano-scale size of the bead makes the
motional decoherence due to levitation negligible. The form of the spin-motion
coupling ensures that the scheme works for thermal states so that moderate
feedback cooling suffices. No separate control or observation of the COM state
is required and thereby one dispenses with cavities, spatially resolved
detection and low mass-dispersion ensembles. The controllable relative phase in
the Ramsey interferometry stems from a gravitational potential difference so
that it uniquely evidences coherence between states which involve the whole
nano-crystal being in spatially distinct locations.

it is possible to explicitly determine the evolution of scalar perturbations,
from the contracting ekpyrotic phase through the bounce and to the post-bounce
expanding epoch. The possibilities of having either one or two scalar fields
have been suggested for the ekpyrotic universe, and both cases will be
considered here. In the case of a single scalar field, the constant mode of the
curvature perturbations after the bounce is found to have a blue spectrum. On
the other hand, for the two scalar field ekpyrotic model where scale-invariant
entropy perturbations source additional terms in the curvature perturbations,
the power spectrum in the post-bounce expanding cosmology is shown to be nearly
scale-invariant and so agrees with observations.

endogenous money creation. The solution provides an analytic framework that
explains all significant dynamical features of Keen's model and their
parametric dependence, including an exact result for both the period and
subsidence rate of the Great Moderation. It emerges that Keen's model has just
two possible long term solutions: stable growth or terminal collapse. While
collapse can come about immediately from economies that are nonviable by virtue
of unsuitable parameters or initial conditions, in general the collapse is
preceded by an interval of exponential growth. In first approximation, the
duration of that exponential growth is half a period of a sinusoidal
oscillation. The period is determined by reciprocal of the imaginary part of
one root of a certain quintic polynomial. The real part of the same root
determines the rate of growth of the economy. The coefficients of that
polynomial depend in a complicated way upon the numerous parameters in the
problem and so, therefore, the pattern of roots. For a favorable choice of
parameters, the salient root is purely real. This is the circumstance that
admits the second possible long term solution, that of indefinite stable
growth, i.e. an infinite period.

graphs while preserving optimal or near-optimal solutions to Steiner problems.
Our main contribution is a polynomial-time algorithm that, given an unweighted
graph $G$ embedded on a surface of genus $g$ and a designated face $f$ bounded
by a simple cycle of length $k$, uncovers a set $F \subseteq E(G)$ of size
polynomial in $g$ and $k$ that contains an optimal Steiner tree for any set of
terminals that is a subset of the vertices of $f$.
  We apply this general theorem to prove that: * given an unweighted graph $G$
embedded on a surface of genus $g$ and a terminal set $S \subseteq V(G)$, one
can in polynomial time find a set $F \subseteq E(G)$ that contains an optimal
Steiner tree $T$ for $S$ and that has size polynomial in $g$ and $|E(T)|$; * an
analogous result holds for an optimal Steiner forest for a set $S$ of terminal
pairs; * given an unweighted planar graph $G$ and a terminal set $S \subseteq
V(G)$, one can in polynomial time find a set $F \subseteq E(G)$ that contains
an optimal (edge) multiway cut $C$ separating $S$ and that has size polynomial
in $|C|$.
  In the language of parameterized complexity, these results imply the first
polynomial kernels for Steiner Tree and Steiner Forest on planar and
bounded-genus graphs (parameterized by the size of the tree and forest,
respectively) and for (Edge) Multiway Cut on planar graphs (parameterized by
the size of the cutset). Additionally, we obtain a weighted variant of our main

exhibit resonance island chain structures with accurately controlled sizes and
positions of the islands. Using complex classical trajectories that evolve
along suitably defined paths in the complex time domain, we construct a
semiclassical theory of the resonance-assisted tunneling process. This
semiclassical approach yields a compact analytical expression for
tunneling-induced level splittings which is found to be in very good agreement
with the exact splittings obtained through numerical diagonalisation.

reaction-diffusion system on a lattice where particles can branch into $m$
offsprings with even $m$ and hop to neighboring sites. If two or more particles
land on the same site, they immediately annihilate pairwise. In this way the
number of particles is preserved modulo two. It is well known that the pc-BARW
with $m=2$ in 1 spatial dimension has no phase transition (it is always
subcritical), if the hopping is described by a continuous time random walk. In
contrast, the $m=2$ 1-d pc-BARW has a phase transition when formulated in
discrete time, but we show that the continuous time limit is non-trivial: When
the time step $\delta t\to 0$, the branching and hopping probabilities at the
critical point scale with different powers of $\delta t$. These powers are
different for different microscopic realizations. Although this phenomenon is
not observed in some other reaction-diffusion systems like, e.g. the contact
process, we argue that it should be generic and not restricted to the 1-d
pc-BARW model.

correlated with student engagement. In addition, we find that student
engagement was a better predictor of post-test performance than pre-test

while measuring the fermion parity of the second pair. First, in a system with
two coupled pairs of Majoranas, we discuss how varying the coupling of one pair
in time, while measuring temporal fermion parity correlations of the second
pair, allows for an experimental probe of long-ranged Majorana entanglement.
Second, we show that the power spectrum of the charge noise (fermion parity
noise) of one pair contains signatures of these correlations, as well as
allowing one to infer the parity relaxation rate.

important role in the dispersal of disks around young stars. The mass loss
model for dust-free disks developed by Hollenbach et al. is currently regarded
as a conventional one and has been used in a wide variety of studies. However,
the rate in this model was derived by the crude so-called 1+1D approximation of
ionizing radiation transfer, which assumes that diffuse radiation propagates in
a direction vertical to the disk. In this study, we revisit the
photoevaporation of dust-free disks by solving the 2D axisymmetric radiative
transfer for steady-state disks. Unlike that solved by the conventional model,
we determine that direct stellar radiation is more important than the diffuse
field at the disk surface. The radial density distribution at the ionization
boundary is represented by the single power-law with an index -3/2 in contrast
to the conventional double power-law. For this distribution, the
photoevaporation rate from the entire disk can be written as a function of the
ionizing photon emissivity, Phi_EUV, from the central star and the disk outer
radius, r_d, as follows: Mdot_PE = 5.4 x 10^-5 x (Phi_EUV/10^49 sec^-1)^1/2 x
(r_d/1000 AU)^1/2 Msun/yr. This new rate depends on the outer disk radius
rather than on the gravitational radius as in the conventional model, caused by
the enhanced contribution to the mass loss from the outer disk annuli. In
addition, we discuss its applications to present-day as well as primordial star
formation.

complementary programs, which together can synthesize the disk-averaged
emergent spectrum of a star with a magnetic field. The first element (a
pre-processing script called CounterPoint) calculates for a given magnetic
field strength, wavelength shifts and polarizations for the components of
Zeeman sensitive lines. The second element (a MOOG driver called SynStokes
derived from the existing MOOG driver Synth) uses the list of Zeeman shifted

emergent spectrum at numerous locations across the stellar disk, accounting for
stellar and magnetic field geometry. The third and final element (a

by weighting the individual emergent spectra by limb darkening and projected
area, and applying the effects of Doppler broadening. All together, the
MOOGStokes package allows users to synthesize emergent spectra of stars with
magnetic fields in a familiar computational framework. MOOGStokes produces
disk-averaged spectra for all Stokes vectors (I, Q, U, and V), normalized by
the continuum. MOOGStokes agrees well with the predictions of INVERS10 a

unlikely the subgiant planet hosts are this massive, but rather the mass

TRILEGAL-based mass distributions disagree with the mass distributions in Lloyd

missing mass problem. Whilst modern cosmological probes indicate that pure
baryonic dynamics is not sufficient on the largest scales, nearby galaxies and
small galaxy groups persistently obey Milgrom's MOND law, which implies that
dynamics at small scales is possibly entirely predicted by the baryons. Here,
we investigate the Local Group timing in this context of Milgromian dynamics.
Making use of the latest measured proper motions and radial velocities for
Andromeda and the Magellanic clouds, we integrate backwards their orbits by
making use of the Milgromian two-body equation of motion. We find that, with
the currently measured proper motions and radial velocity of M31, MOND would
imply that the Milky Way and M31 first moved apart via Hubble expansion after
birth, but then necessarily got attracted again by the Milgromian gravitational
attraction, and had a past fly-by encounter before coming to their present
positions. This encounter would most probably have happened 7 to 11 Gyr ago
(0.8<z<3). The absence of a dark matter halo and its associated dynamical
friction is necessary for such a close encounter not to trigger a merger.
Observational arguments which could exclude or favour such a past encounter
would thus be very important in view of falsifying or vindicating Milgromian
dynamics on the scale of the Local Group. Interestingly, the closest approach
of the encounter is small enough (<55 kpc) to have severe consequences on the
disk dynamics, including perhaps thick disk formation, and on the satellite
systems of both galaxies. The ages of the satellite galaxies and of the young
halo globular clusters, all of which form the vast polar structure around the
Milky Way, are consistent with these objects having been born in this

planetary transits, eclipsing binaries, optical/infrared interferometry and
microlensing events. However, this modeling traditionally represents limb
darkening by a simple law having one or two coefficients that have been derived
from plane-parallel model stellar atmospheres, which has been done by many
researchers. More recently, researchers have gone beyond plane-parallel models
and considered other geometries. We previously studied the limb-darkening
coefficients from spherically symmetric and plane-parallel model stellar
atmospheres for cool giant and supergiant stars, and in this investigation we
apply the same techniques to FGK dwarf stars. We present limb-darkening
coefficients, gravity-darkening coefficients and interferometric angular
diameter corrections from Atlas and SAtlas model stellar atmospheres. We find
that sphericity is important even for dwarf model atmospheres, leading to
significant differences in the predicted coefficients.

fundamental obstacle with the standard configuration adopted: an intrinsic
geometrical loophole that can be exploited to break the security of the

experimental Bell violation with energy-time entanglement distributed over 1 km

by adopting a new experimental design, and by using an actively stabilized

the difficulty of finding galaxies with accurate redshifts in the vicinity of
z~6 quasars. So far, overdensity searches around z~6 quasars have been based on
studies of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs), which probe a redshift range of Delta z
~ 1. This range is large enough to select galaxies that may not be physically
related to the quasar. We use deep narrow- and broadband imaging to study the
environment of the z=5.72 quasar ULAS J0203+0012. The redshift range probed by
our narrow-band selection of Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs) is Delta z ~ 0.1,
which is significantly narrower than the LBG searches. This is the first time
that LAEs were searched for near a z~6 quasar, in an effort to provide clues
about the environments of quasars at the end of the epoch of reionization. We
find no enhancement of LAEs in the surroundings of ULAS J0203+0012 in

interpretations for this non-detection of a galaxy overdensity, including that
(1) the strong ionization from the quasar may prevent galaxy formation in its
immediate vicinity and (2) high-redshift quasars may not reside in the center
of the most massive dark matter halos.

the maximum level of brightness at 1986 January. The spectral type of V582 Aur
can be defined as G0I with strong P Cyg profiles of H alpha and Na I D lines,
which are typical of FU Orionis objects. Our BVRI photometric observations show
large amplitude variations V~2.8 mag. during the 3.5 year period of
observations. Most of the time, however, the star remains in a state close to
the maximum brightness. The deepest drop in brightness was observed in the

between far-infrared and radio continuum emission. We explain the far-infrared
- radio continuum correlation by relating star formation and magnetic field
strength in terms of turbulent magnetic field amplification, where turbulence
is injected by supernova explosions from massive stars. We calculate the
expected amount of turbulence in galaxies based on their star formation rates,
and infer the expected magnetic field strength due to turbulent dynamo
amplification. We estimate the timescales for cosmic ray energy losses via
synchrotron emission, inverse Compton scattering, ionization and bremsstrahlung
emission, probing up to which redshift strong synchrotron emission can be
maintained. We find that the correlation between star formation rate and
magnetic field strength in the local Universe can be understood as a result of
turbulent magnetic field amplification. If the typical gas density in the
interstellar medium increases at high z, we expect an increase of the magnetic
field strength and the radio emission, as indicated by current observations.
Such an increase would imply a modification of the far-infrared - radio
correlation. We expect a breakdown when inverse Compton losses start dominating
over synchrotron emission. For a given star formation surface density, we
calculate the redshift where the breakdown occurs, yielding z (Sigma_SFR/0.0045
M_solar kpc^{-2} yr^{-1})^{1/(6-alpha/2)}. In this relation, the parameter
\alpha describes the evolution of the characteristic ISM density in galaxies as
(1+z)^\alpha. Both the possible raise of the radio emission at high redshift

  Models of ancestral gene order reconstruction have progressively integrated
different evolutionary patterns and processes such as unequal gene content,
gene duplications, and implicitly sequence evolution via reconciled gene trees.
In unicellular organisms, these models have so far ignored lateral gene
transfer, even though it can have an important confounding effect on such
models, as well as a rich source of information on the function of genes
through the detection of transfers of entire clusters of genes.
  Result.
  We report an algorithm together with its implementation, DeCoLT, that
reconstructs ancestral genome organization based on reconciled gene trees which
summarize information on sequence evolution, gene origination, duplication,
loss, and lateral transfer. DeCoLT finds in polynomial time the minimum number
of rearrangements, computed as the number of gains and breakages of adjacencies
between pairs of genes. We apply DeCoLT to 1099 gene families from 36
cyanobacteria genomes.
  Conclusion.
  DeCoLT is able to reconstruct adjacencies in 35 ancestral bacterial genomes
with a thousand genes families in a few hours, and detects clusters of
co-transferred genes. As there is no constraint on genome organization,
adjacencies can be generalized to any relationship between genes to reconstruct
ancestral interactions, functions or complexes with the same framework.

one-step update of a rank-based pilot estimator in the direction of the
efficient influence function, which is calculated explicitly. Moreover,
finite-dimensional algebraic conditions are given that completely characterize
efficiency of the pseudo-likelihood estimator and adaptivity of the model with
respect to the unknown marginal distributions. For correlation matrices
structured according to a factor model, the pseudo-likelihood estimator turns
out to be semiparametrically efficient. On the other hand, for Toeplitz
correlation matrices, the asymptotic relative efficiency of the
pseudo-likelihood estimator can be as low as 20%. These findings are confirmed
by Monte Carlo simulations. We indicate how our results can be extended to
joint regression models.

architectures, which would likely use many more cell sites than found today.
Two major challenges will be i) providing backhaul to all of these cells and
ii) finding efficient techniques to leverage higher frequency bands for mobile
access and backhaul. This paper proposes the use of outdoor millimeter wave
communications for backhaul networking between cells and mobile access within a
cell. To overcome the outdoor impairments found in millimeter wave propagation,
this paper studies beamforming using large arrays. However, such systems will
require narrow beams, increasing sensitivity to movement caused by pole sway
and other environmental concerns. To overcome this, we propose an efficient
beam alignment technique using adaptive subspace sampling and hierarchical beam
codebooks. A wind sway analysis is presented to establish a notion of beam
coherence time. This highlights a previously unexplored tradeoff between array
size and wind-induced movement. Generally, it is not possible to use larger
arrays without risking a corresponding performance loss from wind-induced beam
misalignment. The performance of the proposed alignment technique is analyzed
and compared with other search and alignment methods. The results show
significant performance improvement with reduced search time.

power spectrum and the correlation function by decomposing the dark matter
perturbations into the short- and long-wavelength modes. The evolution of the
dark matter fluctuations can be described as a global coordinate transformation
caused by the long-wavelength displacement vector acting on short-wavelength
matter perturbation undergoing non-linear growth. Using this feature, we
investigate the well known cancellation of the high-$k$ solutions in the
standard perturbation theory. While the standard perturbation theory naturally
satisfies the cancellation of the high-$k$ solutions, some of the recently
proposed improved perturbation theories do not guarantee the cancellation. We
show that this cancellation clarifies the success of the standard perturbation
theory at the 2-loop order in describing the amplitude of the non-linear power
spectrum even at high-$k$ regions.We propose an extension of the standard
2-loop level perturbation theory model of the non-linear power spectrum that
more accurately models the non-linear evolution of the baryon acoustic
oscillation than the standard perturbation theory. The model consists of simple
and intuitive parts: the non-linear evolution of the smoothed power spectrum
without the baryon acoustic oscillations and the non-linear evolution of the
baryon acoustic oscillations due to the large-scale velocity of dark matter and
due to the gravitational attraction between dark matter particles. Our extended
model predicts the smoothing parameter of the baryon acoustic oscillation peak
at $z=0.35$ as $\sim 7.7\ {\rm Mpc}/h$ and describes the small non-linear shift
in the peak position due to the galaxy random motions.

singularity spectrum of a tight-binding model, it is found that the electron
wave functions present a multifractal behavior. Such multifractality is
preserved even for second neighbor interaction, which needs to be taken into
account if a comparison is desired with experimental results. States close to
the Dirac point have a wider multifractal character than those far from this
point as the impurity concentration is increased. The analysis of the results
allows to conclude that in the split-band limit, where impurities act as
vacancies, the system can be well described by a chiral orthogonal symmetry
class, with a singularity spectrum transition approaching freezing as disorder
increases. This also suggests that in doped graphene, localization is in
contrast with the conventional picture of Anderson localization in two
dimensions, showing also that the common belief of the absence of quantum
percolation in two dimensional systems needs to be revised.

demonstrate that such a phenomenon, known as non-local convertibility, is due
to the edge state (de)construction occurring in the system. To this end, we
employ the example of the Ising chain, displaying an order-disorder quantum
phase transitions. Employing both analytical and numerical methods, we compute

is always locally convertible. The edge states behavior explains all these
results and could disclose a paradigm to understand local convertibility in
other quantum phases of matter. The connection we establish between
convertibility and non-local, quantum correlations provides a clear criterion
of which features a universal quantum simulator should possess to outperform a

ensure the functioning of society. To improve the performance of such systems,
we often use risk and vulnerability analysis to find and address system
weaknesses. A critical component of such analyses is the ability to accurately
determine the negative consequences of various types of failures in the system.
Numerous mathematical and simulation models exist which can be used to this
end. However, there are relatively few studies comparing the implications of
using different modeling approaches in the context of comprehensive risk
analysis of critical infrastructures. Thus in this paper, we suggest a
classification of these models, which span from simple topologically-oriented
models to advanced physical flow-based models. Here, we focus on electric power
systems and present a study aimed at understanding the tradeoffs between
simplicity and fidelity in models used in the context of risk analysis.
Specifically, the purpose of this paper is to compare performances measures
achieved with a spectrum of approaches typically used for risk and
vulnerability analysis of electric power systems and evaluate if more
simplified topological measures can be combined using statistical methods to be
used as a surrogate for physical flow models. The results of our work provide
guidance as to appropriate models or combination of models to use when
analyzing large-scale critical infrastructure systems, where simulation times
quickly become insurmountable when using more advanced models, severely
limiting the extent of analyses that can be performed.

Employing a mode-locking technique, we detect how moving lattices deform and
their orientation changes as a magnetic field is tilted from normal to the film
surface. For high tilt angles the lattice orientation is aligned parallely with
the tilt direction. Meanwhile for low tilt angles the lattice orientation
depends on the vortex velocity and a velocity-induced reorientation occurs. The

assembly in which pairs of large assemblies can bind, or self-assemble,
together. In order to bind, two assemblies must have matching glues that can
simultaneously touch each other, and stick together with strength that is at
least the temperature $\tau$, where $\tau$ is some fixed positive integer. We
ask whether the 2HAM is intrinsically universal, in other words we ask: is
there a single universal 2HAM tile set $U$ which can be used to simulate any
instance of the model? Our main result is a negative answer to this question.
We show that for all $\tau' < \tau$, each temperature-$\tau'$ 2HAM tile system
does not simulate at least one temperature-$\tau$ 2HAM tile system. This
impossibility result proves that the 2HAM is not intrinsically universal, in
stark contrast to the simpler (single-tile addition only) abstract Tile
Assembly Model which is intrinsically universal (""The tile assembly model is
intrinsically universal"", FOCS 2012). However, on the positive side, we prove
that, for every fixed temperature $\tau \geq 2$, temperature-$\tau$ 2HAM tile
systems are indeed intrinsically universal: in other words, for each $\tau$
there is a single universal 2HAM tile set $U$ that, when appropriately
initialized, is capable of simulating the behavior of any temperature-$\tau$
2HAM tile system. As a corollary of these results we find an infinite set of
infinite hierarchies of 2HAM systems with strictly increasing simulation power
within each hierarchy. Finally, we show that for each $\tau$, there is a
temperature-$\tau$ 2HAM system that simultaneously simulates all

in the SM with a singlet scalar field. Taking into account the full
contributions to the scattering amplitudes, we derive unitarity conditions on
the scattering matrix which can be translated into bounds on the masses of the
scalar fields. In the case that the singlet scalar field develops vacuum
expectation value (VEV), we get the upper bound on the singlet scalar mass
varying with the mixing between the singlet and Higgs scalars. On the other
hand, the mass of the Higgs scalar can be constrained by the unitarity
condition in the case that the VEV of the singlet scalar is not generated.
Applying the upper bound on the Higgs mass to the scenario of the unitarized
Higgs inflation, we discuss how the unitarity condition can constrain the Higgs
inflation. The singlet scalar mass is not constrained by the unitarity itself
when we impose Z_2 in the model because of no mixing with the Higgs scalar.
But, regarding the singlet scalar field as a cold dark matter candidate, we
derive upper bound on the singlet scalar mass by combining the observed relic
abundance with the unitarity condition.

precisely, given a large $d$-regular graph we assign random weights, drawn from

between $\mathcal{W}$ and the associated limiting spectral distribution
obtained by averaging over the weighted graphs. Among other results, we
establish the existence of a unique `eigendistribution', i.e., a weight
distribution $\mathcal{W}$ such that the associated limiting spectral
distribution is a rescaling of $\mathcal{W}$. Initial investigations suggested
that the eigendistribution was the semi-circle distribution, which by Wigner's
Law is the limiting spectral measure for real symmetric matrices. We prove this
is not the case, though the deviation between the eigendistribution and the
semi-circular density is small (the first seven moments agree, and the
difference in each higher moment is $O(1/d^2)$). Our analysis uses
combinatorial results about closed acyclic walks in large trees, which may be

except one fragment into 3 - 5 components. The number of fragments is small
compared to that found in some turbulent fragmentation models, although
inclusion of magnetic fields may reduce the predicted fragment number and
improve the model agreement. This result demonstrates that fragmentation from
parsec-scale molecular clouds to sub-parsec cores continues to take place
inside the starless cores. The starless cores and their fragments are embedded
in larger filamentary structures, which likely played a role in the core
formation and fragmentation. Most cores show clear velocity gradients, with
magnitudes ranging from 1.7 to 14.3 km/s/pc. We modeled one of them in detail,
and found that its spectra are best explained by a converging flow along a
filament toward the core center; the gradients in other cores may be modeled
similarly. We infer a mass inflow rate of ~ 2 x 10^{-3} Msolar/yr, which is in
principle high enough to overcome radiation pressure and allow for massive star
formation. However, the core contains multiple fragments, and it is unclear
whether the rapid inflow would feed the growth of primarily a single massive
star or a cluster of lower mass objects. We conclude that fast, supersonic
converging flow along filaments play an important role in massive star and
cluster formation.

The human visual system is able to identify and segment different textures in a

three major components of any texture segmentation algorithm: (a) The features
used to represent a texture, (b) the metric induced on this representation
space and (c) the clustering algorithm that runs over these features in order
to segment a given image into different textures. In this paper, we propose an
active contour based novel unsupervised algorithm for texture segmentation. We
use intensity covariance matrices of regions as the defining feature of
textures and find regions that have the most inter-region dissimilar covariance
matrices using active contours. Since covariance matrices are symmetric
positive definite, we use geodesic distance defined on the manifold of
symmetric positive definite matrices PD(n) as a measure of dissimlarity between
such matrices. We demonstrate performance of our algorithm on both artificial

of the closed string vertex operators does not hold in the presence of a cutoff
on the Euclidean world sheet. This introduces extra terms in the Lagrangian at
the cutoff scale and they turn out to be crucial for implementing gauge
invariance. This naive generalization from open string to closed strings
requires a {\em massive} graviton and the gauge symmetry is Abelian, just as in
open string theory. Interestingly, it turns out that if one introduces a non
dynamical background metric (as in background field formalism) and combines a
gauge transformation on the field with a transformation on the coordinates and
background metric, the graviton can be massless. Some examples of background
coordinate covariant equations are worked out explicitly. A preliminary

mixing, able to substantially modify the evolution of close binaries prior to
mass transfer. We construct numerical models accounting for tidal interactions,
meridional circulation, transport of angular momentum, shears and horizontal
turbulence and consider a variety of orbital periods and initial rotation
velocities. Depending on orbital periods and rotation velocities, tidal effects
may spin down (spin down Case) or spin up (spin up Case) the axial rotation. In
both cases, tides may induce a large internal differential rotation. The
resulting tidally induced shear mixing (TISM) is so efficient that the internal
distributions of angular velocity and chemical elements are greatly influenced.
The evolutionary tracks are modified, and in both cases of spin down and spin
up, large amounts of nitrogen can be transported to the stellar surfaces before
any binary mass transfer. Meridional circulation, when properly treated as an
advection, always tends to counteract the tidal interaction, tending to spin up
the surface when it is braked down and vice versa. As a consequence, the times
needed for the axial angular velocity to become equal to the orbital angular
velocity may be larger than given by typical synchronization timescales. Also,
due to meridional circulation some differential rotation remains in tidally
locked binary systems.

it allows an outage constraint to be enforced on every uplink, which is

Maxwell equations, as the generalization of experimental data, are valid only
for averaged values. We show that microscopic electrodynamics should be based
on postulation of the d'Alembert equations for four-vector of the
electromagnetic field potential. The Lorentz condition is valid only for the
averages and provides the implementation of the Maxwell equations for averages.
This concept eliminates the problem of electromagnetic field quantization and
provides the correctness of all known results of quantum electrodynamics.
Therefore, the ""virtuality"" of the longitudinal and scalar photons has a formal
mathematical character, conditioned by the Maxwell equations for averaged

expression. For a long time, those were accepted as proves of evidences in
varied fields such as journalism, forensic investigations, military
intelligence, scientific research and publications, crime detection and legal
proceedings, investigation of insurance claims, medical imaging etc. Today,
digital images have completely replaced the conventional photographs from every
sphere of life but unfortunately, they seldom enjoy the credibility of their
conventional counterparts, thanks to the rapid advancements in the field of
digital image processing. The increasing availability of low cost and sometimes
free of cost image editing software such as Photoshop, Corel Paint Shop,
Photoscape, PhotoPlus, GIMP and Pixelmator have made the tampering of digital
images even more easier and a common practice. Now it has become quite
impossible to say whether a photograph is a genuine camera output or a
manipulated version of it just by looking at it. As a result, photographs have
almost lost their reliability and place as proves of evidences in all fields.
This is why digital image tamper detection has emerged as an important research
area to establish the authenticity of digital photographs by separating the
tampered lots from the original ones. This paper gives a brief history of image
tampering and a state-of-the-art review of the tamper detection techniques.

radio emission from extensive air showers. Using a trigger provided by the
KASCADE-Grande air shower array, the signals of the microwave antennas of the
CROME (Cosmic-Ray Observation via Microwave Emission) experiment have been read
out and searched for signatures of radio emission by high-energy air showers.
Microwave signals have been detected for more than 30 showers with energies
above $3\times10^{16}$\,eV. The observations presented in this Letter are
consistent with a mainly forward-beamed, coherent and polarised emission
process in the GHz frequency range. An isotropic, unpolarised radiation is
disfavoured as the dominant emission model. The measurements show that
microwave radiation offers a new means of studying air showers at very high

total length of the system is the controlled parameter. This imposes a global
constraint in the minimization procedure leading to the equilibrium values of

Casimir forces (CCFs) because they confine its concentration fluctuations and
influence the latter via effective surface fields. To date, CCFs have only been
studied in thermodynamic equilibrium. However, due to the critical slowing
down, the order parameter around a particle can easily be perturbed by any
motion of the colloid or by solvent flow. This leads to significant but largely
unexplored changes in the CCF. Here we study the drag force on a single
colloidal particle moving in a near-critical fluid mixture and the relative
motion of two colloids due to the CCF acting on them. In order to account for
the kinetic couplings among the order parameter field, the solvent velocity
field, and the particle motion, we use a fluid particle dynamics method. These
studies extend the understanding of CCFs from thermal equilibrium to
non-equilibrium processes, which are relevant to current experiments, and show
the emergence of significant effects near the critical point.

of supernova remnants may provide precious information on the shock dynamics
and on the efficiency of particle acceleration at the shock.
  Aims: We calculate the Balmer line emission and the shape of the broad Balmer
line for parameter values suitable for SNR 0509-67.5, as a function of the
cosmic ray acceleration efficiency and of the level of thermal equilibration
between electrons and protons behind the shock. This calculation aims at using
the width of the broad Balmer line emission to infer the cosmic ray
acceleration efficiency in this remnant.
  Methods: We use the recently developed non-linear theory of diffusive shock
acceleration in the presence of neutrals. The semi-analytical approach that we
developed includes a description of magnetic field amplification as due to
resonant streaming instability, the dynamical reaction of both accelerated
particles and turbulent magnetic field on the shock, and all channels of
interaction between neutral atoms and background plasma that change the shock
dynamics.
  Results: We achieve a quantitative assessment of the CR acceleration
efficiency in SNR 0509-67.5 as a function of the shock velocity and different
levels of electron-proton thermalization in the shock region. If the shock
moves faster than ~4500 km/s, one can conclude that particle acceleration must
be taking place with efficiency of several tens of percent. For lower shock
velocity the evidence for particle acceleration becomes less clear because of
the uncertainty in the electron-ion equilibration downstream. We also discuss
the role of future measurements of the narrow Balmer line.

total neutrino masses are favored and a total neutrino mass above 0.15 eV makes
the tension ""highly significant"" (odds ~ 1:150). A consequence of accepting

sawtooth period is found to be minimised when the ECCD resonance is swept to

control, it is possible to avoid the triggering of neoclassical tearing modes,

only modest ECCD power is used for sawtooth control compared to identical

range 0.5-62 MeV. To extend the covered neutron energy range He3 detector was
used to measure neutrons below 0.5 MeV. The obtained yields were normalized to
the charge deposited by the proton beam on the metallic Beryllium target. These
techniques allowed to achieve a wide angular coverage from 0 to 150 degrees and
to explore almost complete neutron energy interval.

finder based on the analysis of the local gravitational potential distribution
measured by fast and simple algorithm applied to a spatial distribution of mass
tracers. Methodology: the GPM performs a two-step exploratory data analysis:
first, it measures the comoving local gravitational potential generated by
neighboring mass tracers at the position of a test point-like mass tracer. The
computation extended to all mass tracers of the sample provides a detailed map
of the negative potential fluctuations. The most negative gravitational
potential is provided by the highest mass density or, in other words, the
deeper is a potential fluctuations in a certain region of space and denser are
the mass tracers in that region. Therefore, from a smoothed potential
distribution, the deepest potential well detects unambiguously a high
concentration in the mass tracer distribution. Second, applying a density
contrast criterion to that mass concentration, a central bound core may be
identify and quantify in terms of memberships and total mass. Results: using a
complete volume-limited sample of galaxy clusters, a huge concentration of
galaxy clusters has been detected. In its central region, 35 clusters seem to
form a massive and bound core enclosed in a spherical volume of 51 Mpc radius.
Conclusions: the substantial agreement of our findings compared with those
obtained by different methodologies, confirms the GPM as a straightforward and
powerful as well as fast cluster finder useful for analyzing large datasets.

measures. It also proposes two alternative generic views of hierarchical
evaluation and introduces two corresponding novel measures. The proposed
measures, along with the state-of-the art ones, are empirically tested on three

frequencies higher than few THz. In this work we demonstrate that, for a given
value of the static external magnetic field, giant Faraday rotation can be
achieved in arrays of graphene microribbons at frequencies much higher than the
corresponding cyclotron frequency. The main feature in the magneto-optical
response of graphene ribbons is not associated with the cyclotron resonance but
rather with the fundamental magnetoplasmon excitation of a single ribbon. The
magnetoplasmon nature of Faraday rotation in graphene ribbons opens great
possibilities, as the resonance frequency can be locally selected by
appropriately choosing the width of the ribbon while still preserving the
tuning capability through a (smaller) external magnetic field.

knowledge hidden in large collections of data. There are, however, negative
social perceptions about data mining, among which potential privacy violation
and potential discrimination. Automated data collection and data mining
techniques such as classification have paved the way to making automated
decisions, like loan granting/denial, insurance premium computation. If the
training datasets are biased in what regards discriminatory attributes like
gender, race, religion, discriminatory decisions may ensue. In the first part
of this thesis, we tackle discrimination prevention in data mining and propose
new techniques applicable for direct or indirect discrimination prevention
individually or both at the same time. We discuss how to clean training
datasets and outsourced datasets in such a way that direct and/or indirect
discriminatory decision rules are converted to legitimate (non-discriminatory)
classification rules. In the second part of this thesis, we argue that privacy
and discrimination risks should be tackled together. We explore the
relationship between privacy preserving data mining and discrimination
prevention in data mining to design holistic approaches capable of addressing
both threats simultaneously during the knowledge discovery process. As part of
this effort, we have investigated for the first time the problem of
discrimination and privacy aware frequent pattern discovery, i.e. the
sanitization of the collection of patterns mined from a transaction database in
such a way that neither privacy-violating nor discriminatory inferences can be
inferred on the released patterns. Moreover, we investigate the problem of
discrimination and privacy aware data publishing, i.e. transforming the data,
instead of patterns, in order to simultaneously fulfill privacy preservation
and discrimination prevention.

oscillator strength between 8 and 10. The quantum dots are found to be fully
described by a model for strongly-confined excitons, in contrast to the
theoretical prediction that excitons in large quantum dots exhibit the
so-called giant oscillator strength. We attribute these findings to localized
ground-state excitons in potential minima created by material intermixing
during growth. We provide further evidence for the strong-confinement regime of
excitons by extracting the size of electron and hole wavefunctions from the
phonon-broadened photoluminescence spectra. Furthermore, we explore the
temperature dependence of the decay dynamics and, for some quantum dots,
observe a pronounced reduction in the effective transition strength with
temperature. We quantify and explain these effects as being an intrinsic
property of large quantum dots owing to thermal excitation of the ground-state

Inflation can be associated with a particle physics phase transition, with the
inflaton being a (D-flat) direction of Higgs fields which break some symmetry
at high energies, e.g. of GUT Higgs fields or of Higgs fields for flavour
symmetry breaking. This is possible since compared to a shift symmetry, which
is usually used to protect a flat inflaton potential, the Heisenberg symmetry
is compatible with a (gauge) non-singlet inflaton field. In contrast to
conventional new inflation models in SUGRA, where the predictions depend on
unknown parameters of the K""ahler potential, the model with Heisenberg symmetry
makes discrete predictions for the primordial perturbation parameters which
depend only on the order n at which the inflaton appears in the effective
superpotential. The predictions for the spectral index n_s can be close to the
best-fit value of the latest Planck 2013 results.

in order to ensure an adequate lifetime of the divertor targets on ITER, a
mechanism is required to decrease the amount of energy released by an ELM, or
to eliminate ELMs altogether. One such amelioration mechanism relies on
perturbing the magnetic field in the edge plasma region, either leading to more
frequent, smaller ELMs (ELM mitigation) or ELM suppression. This technique of
Resonant Magnetic Perturbations (RMPs) has been employed to suppress type I
ELMs at high collisionality/density on DIII-D, ASDEX Upgrade, KSTAR and JET and
at low collisionality on DIII-D. At ITER-like collisionality the RMPs enhance
the transport of particles or energy and keep the edge pressure gradient below
the 2D linear ideal MHD critical value that would trigger an ELM, whereas at
high collisionality/density the type I ELMs are replaced by small type II ELMs.
Although ELM suppression only occurs within limitied operational ranges, ELM
mitigation is much more easily achieved. The exact parameters that determine
the onset of ELM suppression are unknown but in all cases the magnetic
perturbations produce 3D distortions to the plasma and enhanced particle
transport. The incorporation of these 3D effects in codes will be essential in
order to make quantitative predictions for future devices.

the propagation of a wide set of CR species from both astrophysical and exotic
origin in the Galaxy in a wide energy range from tens of MeV to tens of TeV.
DRAGON takes into account all relevant processes in particular diffusion,
convection, reacceleration, fragmentation and energy losses. For the first
time, we present a full 3D version of DRAGON with anisotropic
position-dependent diffusion. In this version, the propagation is calculated
within a 3D cartesian grid and the user is able to implement realistic and
structured three dimensional source, gas and regular magnetic field
distributions. Moreover, it is possible to specify an arbitrary function of
position and rigidity for the diffusion coefficients in the parallel and
perpendicular direction to the regular magnetic field of the Galaxy. The code
opens many new possibilities in the study of CR physics. In particular, we can
study for the first time the impact of the spiral arm structure on the leptonic
spectra: taking into account the fact that we live in an interarm region, far
from most sources, we obtain - due to increased energy losses - a steeper
electron spectrum compared to the assumption of a smooth source term. We
discuss the implications of these results on our understanding on leptonic
spectra and we briefly mention future studies that can be performed with our
new 3D code.

generalized Riemann curvature in $t_8t_8R^4$, proposed by Gross and Sloan,
produces various NS-NS couplings which are invariant under T-duality. Recently,
using the combination of S-duality and T-duality transformations on these
couplings, we have found groups of couplings which are invariant under the
S-duality transformation. In this paper, we have examined the couplings
involving the dilaton with direct scattering amplitude calculations of four
NS-NS vertex operators in the superstring theory and found exact agreement.
  The coupling $\eps_{10}\eps_{10}R^4$ is a total derivative term at four-field
level. The $\sigma$-model beta function approach implies the presence of this
term at the tree-level. By examining the sphere-level scattering amplitude of
five gravitons, we have also confirmed the presence of this term in the
tree-level effective action.

photometric redshift information, including a contribution from flux
magnification, as a probe of cosmology. We present cosmological forecasts when
clustering data alone is used, and when clustering is combined with a cosmic
shear analysis. We consider two types of clustering analysis: firstly,
clustering with only redshift auto-correlations in tomographic redshift bins;
secondly, using all available redshift bin correlations. Finally, we consider
how inferred cosmological parameters may be biased using each analysis when
flux magnification is neglected. Results are presented for a Stage III
ground-based survey, and a Stage IV space-based survey modelled with
photometric redshift errors, and values for the slope of the luminosity
function inferred from CFHTLenS catalogues. We find that combining clustering
information with shear can improve constraints on cosmological parameters,
giving an improvement to a Dark Energy Task Force-like figure of merit by a
factor of 1.33 when only auto-correlations in redshift are used for the
clustering analysis, rising to 1.52 when cross-correlations in redshift are
also included. The addition of galaxy-galaxy lensing gives further improvement,
with increases in figure of merit by a factor of 2.82 and 3.7 for each type of
clustering analysis respectively. The presence of flux magnification in a
clustering analysis does not significantly affect the precision of cosmological
constraints when combined with cosmic shear and galaxy-galaxy lensing. However
if magnification is neglected, inferred cosmological parameter values are
biased, with biases in some cosmological parameters larger than statistical
errors. (Abridged)

stars in this work, so our solutions are most immediately applicable to
slowly-rotating systems such as magnetars. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that
magnetospheres qualitatively resembling those expected for both magnetars and

the interior and exterior regions are again not independent but evolve

low multipoles in CMB power spectrum are lower than their theoretically
predicted values. Possible angular correlation between the orientations of
these low multipoles have also been claimed. It is important to investigate the
possibility that the power deficiency at low multipoles may not be of
primordial origin and is only an observation artifact coming from the scan
procedure adapted in the WMAP or Planck satellites. Therefore, its always
important to investigate all the observational artifacts that can mimic them.
The CMB dipole which is almost 550 times higher than the quadrupole can leak to
the higher multipoles due to the non-symmetric beam shape of the WMAP. In this
paper a formalism has been developed and simulations are carried out to study
the effect of the non-symmetric beam on this power transfer. It is interesting
to observed that a small but non-negligible amount of power from the dipole can
get transferred to the quadrupole and the higher multipoles due to the
non-symmetric beam. It is shown that in case of WMAP scan strategy the shape of
the quadrupole coming due to this power leakage is very much similar to the
observed quadrupole from WMAP data. Simulations have also been carried out for
Planck scan strategy. It is seen that for Planck scan strategy the power
transfer is not only limited to the quadrupole but also to a few higher low
multipoles. Since the actual beam shapes of Planck are not publicly available
we present results in terms of upper limits on asymmetric beam parameters that
would contaminate of the quadrupole power at the level of $1\mu K$.

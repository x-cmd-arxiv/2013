evidence that $^{56}$Ni synthesized by explosive nucleosynthesis is mixed into
fast moving matter ($\gtrsim$ 3,500 km s$^{-1}$) in the exploding star. In
order to clarify the key conditions for reproducing such high velocity of
$^{56}$Ni, we revisit matter mixing in aspherical core-collapse supernova
explosions. Explosions are initiated artificially by injecting thermal and
kinetic energies around the interface between the iron core and the
silicon-rich layer. Perturbations of 5% or 30% amplitude in the radial
velocities are introduced at several points in time. We found that no high
velocity $^{56}$Ni can be obtained if we consider bipolar explosions with
perturbations (5% amplitude) of pre-supernova origins. If large perturbations
(30% amplitude) are introduced or exist due to some unknown mechanism in a
later phase just before the shock wave reaches the hydrogen envelope, $^{56}$Ni
with a velocity of 3,000 km s$^{-1}$ can be obtained. Aspherical explosions
that are asymmetric across the equatorial plane with clumpy structures in the
initial shock waves are investigated. We found that the clump sizes affect the
penetration of $^{56}$Ni. Finally, we report that an aspherical explosion model
that is asymmetric across the equatorial plane with multiple perturbations of
pre-supernova origins can cause the penetration of $^{56}$Ni clumps into fast
moving matter of 3,000 km s$^{-1}$. We show that both aspherical explosion with
clumpy structures and perturbations of pre-supernova origins may be necessary
to reproduce the observed high velocity of $^{56}$Ni. To confirm this, more
robust three-dimensional simulations are required.

in a proper phase space); unsteady vortices aperiodically changing their
parameters (homoclinic contour); periodic motion (limit cycle); and chaotic
motion. The transition to chaotic motion did not include Hopf bifurcation.
Numerical resolution of the thin concentration polarization layer showed
spike-like charge profiles along the surface, which could be, depending on the

regular (near-sinusoidal) oscillations for the overlimiting regimes. There is a
qualitative agreement of the experimental and the theoretical values of the
threshold of instability, the dominant size of the observed coherent

~1 and 13 AU, possibly cleared out by a planetary companion or planetary
system. We want to identify the nature of the unseen companion near the far end
of the disk gap. We use mid-infrared interferometry at multiple baselines to
constrain the curvature of the disk wall at the far end of the gap. We use 2D
hydrodynamical simulations of embedded planets and brown dwarfs to estimate
viscosity of the disk and the mass of a companion close to the disk wall. We
find that the disk wall at the far end of the gap is not vertical, but
rounded-off by a gradient in the surface density. Such a gradient can be
reproduced in hydrodynamical simulations with a single, heavy companion
(>=30...80 M_Jup) while the disk has viscosity of at least \alpha{} >~ 5 10^-3.
Taking into account the changes in the temperature structure after gap opening
reduces the lower limit on the planet mass and disk viscosity to 20 M_Jup and
\alpha{} = 2 10^-3. The object in the disk gap of HD 100546 that shapes the
disk wall is most likely a 60(+20)(-40) M_Jup brown dwarf, while the disk
viscosity is estimated to be at least \alpha{} = 2 10^-3. The disk viscosity is
an important factor in estimating planetary masses from disk morphologies: more
viscous disks need heavier planets to open an equally deep gap.

cooperative game theory. It specifies a unique way in which the reward from
cooperation can be ""fairly"" divided among players. While it has a wide range of
real world applications, its use is in many cases hampered by the hardness of
its computation. A number of researchers have tackled this problem by (i)
focusing on classes of games where the Shapley value can be computed
efficiently, or (ii) proposing representation formalisms that facilitate such
efficient computation, or (iii) approximating the Shapley value in certain
classes of games. For the classical \textit{characteristic function}
representation, the only attempt to approximate the Shapley value for the
general class of games is due to Castro \textit{et al.} \cite{castro}. While
this algorithm provides a bound on the approximation error, this bound is
\textit{asymptotic}, meaning that it only holds when the number of samples
increases to infinity. On the other hand, when a finite number of samples is
drawn, an unquantifiable error is introduced, meaning that the bound no longer
holds. With this in mind, we provide non-asymptotic bounds on the estimation
error for two cases: where (i) the \textit{variance}, and (ii) the
\textit{range}, of the players' marginal contributions is known. Furthermore,
for the second case, we show that when the range is significantly large
relative to the Shapley value, the bound can be improved (from $O(\frac{r}{m})$
to $O(\sqrt{\frac{r}{m}})$). Finally, we propose, and demonstrate the
effectiveness of using stratified sampling for improving the bounds further.

Namely, e.g., phase modulated signalling (Alice using, e.g., |+>,|e>-states)
overcomes the quantum noise already at a lower order in perturbation theory.
Second, we study the effect of mode truncations that are commonly used in

show that, on general grounds, namely for causality to be preserved, the UV

that it is possible to achieve strong and ultrastrong coupling regimes between
SMM crystals and the superconducting circuit, with strong hints that such a
coupling could also be reached for individual molecules close to constrictions.
Building on the resulting coupling strengths and the typical coherence times of
these molecules (of the order of microseconds), we conclude that SMMs can be
used for coherent storage and manipulation of quantum information, either in
the context of quantum computing or in quantum simulations. Throughout the work
we also discuss in detail the family of molecules that are most suitable for
such operations, based not only on the coupling strength, but also on the
typical energy gaps and the simplicity with which they can be tuned and
oriented. Finally, we also discuss practical advantages of SMMs, such as the
possibility to fabricate the SMMs ensembles on the chip through the deposition
of small droplets.

  We consider the problem in several models.
  -- Concerning labeling schemes where we assign labels to elements and the
query is to be answered just by examining the labels of the queried elements
(without any extra space): if each vertex is required to have a unique label,
then we show that a label space of (\sum_{i=1}^n \lfloor {n \over i} \rfloor)
is necessary and sufficient. In other words, \lg n + \lg \lg n + O(1) bits of
space are necessary and sufficient for representing each of the labels. This
slightly strengthens the known lower bound and is in contrast to the known
necessary and sufficient bound of \lceil \lg n \rceil for the label length, if
each vertex need not get a unique label.
  --Concerning succinct data structures for the problem when the n elements are
to be uniquely assigned labels from label set {1, 2, ...n}, we first show that
\Theta(\sqrt n) bits are necessary and sufficient to represent the equivalence
class information. This space includes the space for implicitly encoding the
vertex labels. We can support the query in such a structure in O(\lg n) time in
the standard word RAM model. We then develop structures resulting in one where
the queries can be supported in constant time using O({\sqrt n} \lg n) bits of
space. We also develop space efficient structures where union operation along

this paper I will recall the notion and the main properties of stem functions.
After that I will introduce the class of slice regular functions induced by

microturbulence increases towards higher effective temperature and lower

scales forms a geometrically- and optically-thick entity in the equatorial
plane around the accretion disk and broad-line region - dubbed ""dust torus"" -
that emits the bulk of the sub-arcsecond-scale IR emission and gives rise to
orientation-dependent obscuration. Here we report detailed interferometry
observations of the unobscured (type 1) AGN in NGC 3783 that allow us to
constrain the size, elongation, and direction of the mid-IR emission with high
accuracy. The mid-IR emission is characterized by a strong elongation toward
position angle PA -52 deg, closely aligned with the polar axis (PA -45 deg). We
determine half-light radii along the major and minor axes at 12.5 {\mu}m of
(4.23 +/- 0.63) pc x (1.42 +/- 0.21) pc, which corresponds to
intrinsically-scaled sizes of (69.4 +/- 10.8) rin x (23.3 +/- 3.5) rin for the
inner dust radius of rin = 0.061 pc as inferred from near-IR reverberation
mapping. This implies an axis ratio of 3:1, with about 60-90% of the 8-13
{\mu}m emission associated with the polar-elongated component. These
observations are difficult to reconcile with the standard interpretation that
most of the parsec-scale mid-IR emission in AGN originates from the torus and
challenges the justification of using simple torus models to model the
broad-band IR emission. It is quite likely that the hot-dust emission in NGC
3783 as recently resolved by near-IR interferometry is misaligned with the
mid-IR emitting source, which also finds a correspondence in the two distinct
3-5 {\mu}m and 20 {\mu}m bumps seen in the high-angular resolution spectral
energy distribution (SED). We conclude that these observations support a
scenario where the majority of the mid-IR emission in Seyfert AGN originates
from a dusty wind in the polar region of the AGN.

shell-like structures, and these break up into a small number of massive
high-density clumps which then spawn star clusters; star formation occurs
relatively quickly, and delivers somewhat higher stellar masses. Conversely, if
the fractal dimension is high, the border of the HII region is dominated by a
large number of pillars and cometary globules, which contain compact dense
clumps and tend to spawn single stars or individual multiple systems; star
formation occurs later, the stellar masses are somewhat lower, and the stars
are more widely distributed.

non-relativistic species such as baryons or dark matter are known to be
sub-dominant to adiabatic fluctuations. Perturbations in the relative densities
of baryons and dark matter (known as compensated isocurvature perturbations, or
CIPs), however, are surprisingly poorly constrained. CIPs leave no imprint in
the cosmic microwave background (CMB) on observable scales, at least at linear
order in their amplitude and zeroth order in the amplitude of adiabatic
perturbations. It is thus not yet empirically known if baryons trace dark
matter at the surface of last scattering. If CIPs exist, they would spatially
modulate the Silk damping scale and acoustic horizon, causing distinct
fluctuations in the CMB temperature/polarization power spectra across the sky:
this effect is first order in both the CIP and adiabatic mode amplitudes. Here,
temperature data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) are used
to conduct the first CMB-based observational search for CIPs, using
off-diagonal correlations and the CMB trispectrum. Reconstruction noise from
weak lensing and point sources is shown to be negligible for this data set. No
evidence for CIPs is observed, and a 95%-confidence upper limit of $1.1\times
10^{-2}$ is imposed to the amplitude of a scale-invariant CIP power spectrum.
This limit agrees with CIP sensitivity forecasts for WMAP, and is competitive
with smaller scale constraints from measurements of the baryon fraction in
galaxy clusters. It is shown that the root-mean-squared CIP amplitude on 5-100
degree scales is smaller than 0.07-0.17 (depending on the scale) at the
95%-confidence level. Temperature data from the Planck satellite will provide
an even more sensitive probe for the existence of CIPs, as will the upcoming
ACTPol and SPTPol experiments on smaller angular scales.

their global oscillations, is a valuable tool to obtain stellar parameters such
as mass, radius, surface gravity and mean density. These parameters can be
obtained using certain scaling relations which are based on an asymptotic
approximation. Usually the observed oscillation parameters are assumed to
follow these scaling relations. Recently, it has been questioned whether this
is a valid approach, i.e., whether the order of the observed oscillation modes
are high enough to be approximated with an asymptotic theory. In this work we
use stellar models to investigate whether the differences between observable
oscillation parameters and their asymptotic estimates are indeed significant.
We compute the asymptotic values directly from the stellar models and derive
the observable values from adiabatic pulsation calculations of the same models.
We find that the extent to which the atmosphere is included in the models is a
key parameter. Considering a larger extension of the atmosphere beyond the
photosphere reduces the difference between the asymptotic and observable values
of the large frequency separation. Therefore, we conclude that the currently
suggested discrepancies in the scaling relations might have been overestimated.
Hence, based on the results presented here we believe that the suggestions of
Mosser et al. (2013) should not be followed without careful consideration.

the highly-siderophile elements (HSEs) in Earth's mantle are thought to have
been accreted as a `late veneer' after the end of the giant impact phase.
Bottke et al (2010) proposed that the large Earth-to-Moon HSE abundance ratio
can be explained if the late veneer was characterized by large (D =
1000-4000km) impactors. Here we simulate the evolution of the terrestrial
planets during a stochastic late veneer phase from the end of accretion until
the start of the late heavy bombardment ~500 Myr later. We show that a late
veneer population of 0.05 Earth masses dominated by large (D > 1000km) bodies
naturally delivers a ~0.01 Earth mass veneer to Earth, consistent with
constraints. The eccentricities and inclinations of the terrestrial planets are
excited by close encounters with the largest late veneer bodies. We find the
best agreement with their post-veneer orbits if either a) the terrestrial
planets' pre-veneer angular momentum deficit AMD_0 was less than half of the
current one AMD_now, or b) AMD_0 <= AMD_now and the veneer was limited to
smaller (D_max <= 2000km) bodies. Veneer impacts on Venus, Earth and Mars were
mostly accretionary but on Mercury and the Moon they were mostly erosive. In
~20% of simulations an energetic impact occurred that could have removed >25%
of Mercury's mass, thereby increasing its iron mass fraction. We show that, due
to the erosive nature of larger impacts, the Moon cannot accrete any material
from objects larger than 500-1000km. The large Earth-to-Moon HSE abundance
ratio is explained if the late veneer included large impactors (D >=
500-1000km) regardless of their size distribution, as long as most of Earth's
veneer came from large bodies. The spin angular momenta imparted by stochastic
late veneer impacts was far in excess of the current ones for Mercury and

interplay of self-interactions and coupling to matter, chameleon particles have
a mass that depends on the ambient matter density. The manifestation of the
fifth force mediated by chameleons therefore depends sensitively on their
environment, which makes for a rich phenomenology. In this article, we review
two recent results on chameleon phenomenology. The first result a pair of no-go
theorems limiting the cosmological impact of chameleons and their
generalizations: i) the range of the chameleon force at cosmological density
today can be at most ~Mpc; ii) the conformal factor relating Einstein- and
Jordan-frame scale factors is essentially constant over the last Hubble time.
These theorems imply that chameleons have negligible effect on the linear
growth of structure, and cannot account for the observed cosmic acceleration
except as some form of dark energy. The second result pertains to the quantum
stability of chameleon theories. We show how requiring that quantum corrections
be small, so as to allow reliable predictions of fifth forces, leads to an
upper bound of m < 0.0073 (\rho/ 10 g cm^{-3})^{1/3} eV for gravitational
strength coupling, whereas fifth force experiments place a lower bound of
m>0.0042 eV. An improvement of less than a factor of two in the range of fifth
force experiments could test all classical chameleon field theories whose
quantum corrections are well-controlled and couple to matter with nearly
gravitational strength regardless of the specific form of the chameleon
potential.

that contain a stellar spheroid and their mass is tightly correlated with
properties such as stellar bulge mass and velocity dispersion. There are also
strong theoretical arguments that feedback from supermassive black holes plays
an important role in shaping the high mass end of the galaxy mass function,
hence to accurately model galaxies we also need to model the black holes. We
present a comparison of two black hole growth models implemented within a
large-scale, cosmological SPH simulation including star formation and feedback.
One model is a modified Bondi-Hoyle prescription that grows black holes based
on the smooth density of local gas, while the other is the recently proposed
Accretion Disc Particle (ADP) method. This model swallows baryonic particles
that pass within an accretion radius of the black hole and adds them to a
subgrid accretion disc. Black holes are then grown by material from this disc.
We find that both models can reproduce local scaling relations, although the
ADP model is offset from the observed relations at high black hole masses. The
total black hole mass density agrees between models to within a factor of
three, but both struggle to reproduce the black hole mass function. The
simulated mass functions are too steep and underestimate the number of
intermediate and high mass black holes. In addition, the ADP model swallows
excessive amounts of material at the resolution of large-scale, cosmological
simulations producing unrealistically large accretion discs. Future work needs
to be performed to improve the black hole mass function within simulations.
This should be done through the mass growth and feedback as they are strongly
coupled and should not be treated as separate entities.

step back from GJ 1214b to investigate the role that planetary mass,
composition, and temperature play in impacting the transmission spectra of
these low-mass low-density (LMLD) planets. Under the assumption that these
planets accrete modest hydrogen-dominated atmospheres and planetesimals, we use
population synthesis models to show that predicted metal enrichments of the
H/He envelope are high, with metal mass fraction Z_env values commonly 0.6 to
0.9, or ~100 to 400+ times solar. The high mean molecular weight of such
atmospheres (\mu ~ 5-12) would naturally help to flatten the transmission
spectrum of most LMLD planets. The high metal abundance would also provide
significant condensible material for cloud formation. It is known that the H/He
abundance in Uranus and Neptune decreases with depth, and we show that
atmospheric evaporation of LMLD planets could expose atmospheric layers with
gradually higher Z_env. However, values of Z_env close to solar composition can
also arise, so diversity should be expected. Photochemically produced hazes,
potentially due to methane photolysis, are another possibility for obscuring
transmission spectra. Such hazes may not form above T_eq of ~800-1100 K, which
is testable if such warm, otherwise low mean molecular weight atmospheres are
stable against atmospheric evaporation. We find that available transmission
data are consistent with relatively high mean molecular weight atmospheres for

line region (BLR); the inactive companion BH is orbiting at a distance of a few
R_BLR, where R_BLR~0.01-0.1 pc is the BLR size. We search for the expected
line-of-sight acceleration of the broad line velocity from binary orbital
motion by cross-correlating SDSS spectra from two epochs separated by up to
several years in the quasar restframe. Out of ~700 pairs of spectra for which
we have good measurements of the velocity shift between two epochs (1-sigma
error~40 km/s), we detect 28 systems with significant velocity shifts in broad
Hbeta, among which seven are the best candidates for the hypothesized binaries.
We use the distribution of the observed accelerations (mostly non-detections)
to place constraints on the abundance of such binary systems among the general
quasar population. Excess variance in the velocity shift is inferred for
observations separated by longer than 0.4 yr (quasar restframe). Attributing
all the excess to binary motion would imply that most of the quasars in this
sample must be in binaries; that the inactive BH must be on average more
massive than the active one; and that the binary separation is at most a few
times the size of the BLR. However, if this excess variance is partly or
largely due to long-term broad line variability, the requirement of a large

study warp propagation in the bending-wave regime, with the addition of an
external torque due to the binary gravitational potential. In particular, we
want to test the linear regime, for which an analytic theory has been
developed. In order to do so, we first compute analytically the steady state
shape of an inviscid disc subject to the binary torques. The steady state tilt
is a monotonically increasing function of radius. In the absence of viscosity,
the disc does not present any twist. Then, we compare the time-dependent
evolution of the warped disc calculated via the known linearised equations both
with the analytic solutions and with full 3D numerical simulations, which have
been performed with the PHANTOM SPH code using 2 million particles. We find a
good agreement both in the tilt and in the phase evolution for small
inclinations, even at very low viscosities. Moreover, we have verified that the
linearised equations are able to reproduce the diffusive behaviour when
{\alpha} > H/R, where {\alpha} is the disc viscosity parameter. Finally, we
have used the 3D simulations to explore the non-linear regime. We observe a
strongly non-linear behaviour, which leads to the breaking of the disc. Then,
the inner disc starts precessing with its own precessional frequency. This
behaviour has already been observed with numerical simulations in accretion
discs around spinning black holes. The evolution of circumstellar accretion
discs strongly depends on the warp evolution. Therefore the issue explored in
this paper could be of fundamental importance in order to understand the
evolution of accretion discs in crowded environments, when the gravitational
interaction with other stars is highly likely, and in multiple systems.

in a companion paper, such that the warp propagates into the disc as a bending
wave, which is expected to be the case for protostellar discs. The validity of
such an approach has been confirmed by comparing its results with full 3D SPH
simulations on extended discs. In the present case, we use this 1D code to
model the propagation of the warp in a narrow disc. If the inner truncation
radius of the disc is set by the binary tidal torques at {\sim} 1 AU, we find
that the disc should extend out to 6-10 AU (depending on the models), and is
therefore wider than previously suggested. Our simulations show that such a
disc does reach an almost steady state, and then precesses as a rigid body. The
disc displays a very small warp, with a tilt inclination that increases with
radius in order to keep the disc in equilibrium against the binary torque.
However, for such wider discs, the presence of viscosity leads to a secular
decay of the tilt on a timescale of {\approx} 3000 ({\alpha}/0.05)^(-1) years,
where {\alpha} is the disc viscosity parameter. The presence of a third body
(such as a planet), orbiting at roughly 10 AU might simultaneously explain the
outer truncation of the disc and the maintenance of the tilt for a prolonged
time.

Taurus-Auriga star-forming region is a hierarchical quadruple system of M
stars. It was previously known to be a close (~0.5 arc sec) visual pair, with
one component being a moderately eccentric 12.94-day single-lined spectroscopic
binary. A re-analysis of archival optical spectra complemented with new
near-infrared spectroscopy shows both visual components to be double-lined, the
second one having a period of 4.06 days and a circular orbit. In addition to
the orbital elements, we determine optical and near-infrared flux ratios,
effective temperatures, and projected rotational velocities for all four stars.
Using existing photometric monitoring observations of the system that had
previously revealed the rotational period of the primary in the longer-period
binary, we detect also the rotational signal of the primary in the 4.06-day
binary, which is synchronized with the orbital motion. With only the assumption
of coevality, a comparison of all of these constraints with current stellar
evolution models from the Dartmouth series points to an age of 1.4 Myr and a
distance of 133 pc, consistent with previous estimates for the region and
suggesting the system is on the near side of the Taurus complex. Similar
comparisons of the properties of LkCa3 and of the well-known quadruple pre-main
sequence system GG Tau with the widely used models from the Lyon series for a
mixing length parameter of alpha_ML = 1.0 strongly favor the Dartmouth models.

of the stellar crust by internal magnetic stresses. We present time-dependent
axisymmetric simulations showing in detail the evolution of relativistic
force-free magnetospheres subjected to slow twisting through large angles. When
the twist amplitude is small, the magnetosphere moves quasi-statically through
a sequence of equilibria of increasing free energy. At some twist amplitude the
magnetosphere becomes tearing-mode unstable to forming a resistive current
sheet, initiating large-scale magnetic reconnection in which a significant
fraction of the magnetic free energy can be dissipated. This ""critical"" twist
angle is insensitive to the resistive length scale. Rapid shearing temporarily
stabilizes the magnetosphere beyond the critical angle, allowing the
magnetosphere of a rapidly differentially rotating star to store, and
dissipate, more free energy. In addition to these effects, shearing the surface
of a rotating star increases the spindown torque applied to the star. If
shearing is much slower than rotation, the resulting spikes in spindown rate
can occur on timescales anywhere from the long twisting timescale to the
stellar spin period or shorter, depending both on the stellar shear
distribution and the existing distribution of magnetospheric twists. A model in
which energy is stored in the magnetosphere, and released by a magnetospheric
instability, therefore predicts large changes in the measured spindown rate
before SGR giant flares.

the seven VMC epochs in the second case. Separate proper motion values are
obtained for variable stars in the field. The proper motion of ~40,000 LMC
stars in the tile, with respect to ~8000 background galaxies, obtained from VMC
data alone, is mu_alpha cos(delta) = +2.20+/-0.06 (stat) +/-0.29 (sys) and
mu_delta = +1.70+/-0.06 (stat) +/-0.30 (sys) mas/yr. This value agrees with
recent ground-based determinations in a nearby field but is larger than studies
with the HST; the cause of this discrepancy may be due to additional systematic
errors in the data. The LMC proper motion is also clearly distinct from the
proper motion derived for stars of the Milky Way. The relative proper motion
between the foreground stars and the LMC stars is ~5 mas/yr. Furthermore, we
measure a decrease of the proper motion with increasing logarithm of stellar
age for LMC stars. This study, based on just one VMC tile, shows the potential
of the 2MASS-VMC and VMC-VMC combinations for a comprehensive investigation of
the proper motion across the Magellanic system. (Abridged)

intense compact starbursts in the central ~100-500 pc region of gas-rich major
mergers. Here we probe the build-up of nuclear cusps during the actual
starburst phase for a complete sample of Luminous Infrared Galaxy systems (85
LIRGs, with 11.4<log[LIR/L_sun]<12.5) in the GOALS sample. Cusp properties are
derived via 2-dimensional fitting of the nuclear stellar light imaged in the
near-infrared by the Hubble Space Telescope and have been combined with mid-IR
diagnostics for AGN/starburst characterization. We find that nuclear stellar
cusps are resolved in 76% of LIRGs (merger and non-interacting galaxies). The
cusp strength and luminosity increases with far-IR luminosity (excluding AGN)
and merger stage, confirming theoretical models that starburst activity is
associated with the build-up of nuclear stellar cusps. Evidence for ultra
compact nuclear starbursts is found in ~13% of LIRGs, which have a strong
unresolved central NIR light component but no significant contribution of an
AGN. The nuclear near-IR surface density (measured within 1 kpc radius)
increases by a factor of ~5 towards late merger stages. A careful comparison to
local early-type galaxies with comparable masses reveals (a) that local
(U)LIRGs have a significantly larger cusp fraction and (b) that the majority of
the cusp LIRGs have host galaxy luminosities (H-band) similar to core
ellipticals which is roughly one order in magnitude larger than for cusp

late 1970's, the theory of modular forms associated to Drinfeld modules was
born in analogy with elliptic modular forms \cite{go1}, \cite{go2}. The
associated expansions at $\infty$ are quite complicated and no obvious limits
at finite primes ${\mathfrak v}$ were apparent. Recently, however, there has

constructed families of cusp forms with such expansions. It is our purpose in

each user is equipped with an arbitrary number of antennas. A closed-loop
scenario is assumed, for which a practical capacity-approaching scheme is
developed. By applying judiciously chosen unitary operations at the transmit
and receive nodes, the channel matrices are triangularized so that the
resulting matrices have equal diagonals, up to a possible multiplicative scalar
factor. This, along with the utilization of successive interference
cancellation, reduces the coding and decoding tasks to those of coding and
decoding over the single-antenna additive white Gaussian noise channel. Over
the resulting effective channel, any off-the-shelf code may be used. For the
two-user case, it was recently shown that such joint unitary triangularization
is always possible. In this paper, it is shown that for more than two users, it
is necessary to carry out the unitary linear processing jointly over multiple
channel uses, i.e., space-time processing is employed. It is further shown that
exact triangularization, where all resulting diagonals are equal, is still not
always possible, and appropriate conditions for the existence of such are
established for certain cases. When exact triangularization is not possible, an
asymptotic construction is proposed, that achieves the desired property of
equal diagonals up to edge effects that can be made arbitrarily small, at the

  The main result establishes isomorphisms between these spaces and certain

orthogonal group. This result is valid for tensors with an arbitrary number of
indices and symmetries among them and, in certain cases, it allows to
explicitly compute basis, using the theory of invariants of the orthogonal

signals with a small number of measurements. As such it is very attractive for
hardware implementations. Therefore, correct calibration of the hardware is a
central is- sue. In this paper we study the so-called blind calibration, i.e.
when the training signals that are available to perform the calibration are
sparse but unknown. We extend the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm
used in CS to the case of blind calibration. In the calibration-AMP, both the
gains on the sensors and the elements of the signals are treated as unknowns.
Our algorithm is also applica- ble to settings in which the sensors distort the
measurements in other ways than multiplication by a gain, unlike previously
suggested blind calibration algorithms based on convex relaxations. We study
numerically the phase diagram of the blind calibration problem, and show that
even in cases where convex relaxation is pos- sible, our algorithm requires a
smaller number of measurements and/or signals in order to perform well.

human social dynamics within massive online games can shed new light on social
interactions in general and inform the development of more engaging systems.
Here, we study a novel, large friendship network, inferred from nearly 18
billion social interactions over 44 weeks between 17 million individuals in the
popular online game Halo: Reach. This network is one of the largest, most
detailed temporal interaction networks studied to date, and provides a novel
perspective on the dynamics of online friendship networks, as opposed to mere
interaction graphs. Initially, this network exhibits strong structural turnover
and decays rapidly from a peak size. In the following period, however, both
network size and turnover stabilize, producing a dynamic structural
equilibrium. In contrast to other studies, we find that the Halo friendship
network is non-densifying: both the mean degree and the average pairwise
distance are stable, suggesting that densification cannot occur when
maintaining friendships is costly. Finally, players with greater long-term
engagement exhibit stronger local clustering, suggesting a group-level social
engagement process. These results demonstrate the utility of online games for
studying social networks, shed new light on empirical temporal graph patterns,
and clarify the claims of universality of network densification.

presence of generic nonlinear loss. Moreover, the scalings of $n$-pulse
interaction effects with $n$ and $m$ and the strong dependence on initial
soliton positions lead to complex collision dynamics, which is very different
from the one observed in fast NLS soliton collisions in the presence of cubic
loss.

neglecting the out-of-plane component of the traction stresses. Finally, we
consider the cell's mechanosensing of substratum thickness by 3D traction
stresses, finding that, when cells adhere on thin substrata, their out-of-plane
traction stresses can reach four times deeper into the substratum than their
in-plane traction stresses. It is also found that the substratum stiffness

reflection off a Compton-thick disk with type depending only on inclination
angle. We conclude that a more complex reflecting geometry such as a combined
disk and torus or clumpy torus is likely a more accurate picture of the
Compton-thick material. We find that Compton reflection is present in ~85% of
Seyferts and by comparing Fe line EW's to Compton reflection hump strengths we
have found that on average 40% of the Fe line arises in Compton thick material,

luminous (L_500 > 5x10^44 erg/s) clusters branch into two populations --- radio
halos lie on the correlation, while clusters with upper limits to radio-halo
emission are well below that correlation. This bimodality remains if we excise
cool cores from the X-ray luminosities. Correlating with Planck data, we find
that P_1.4 scales with the cluster integrated SZ signal within R_500 as P_1.4
Y_500^2.1, in line with previous findings. However, contrary to previous
studies that were limited by incompleteness and small sample size, we find that
the ""SZ-luminous"" Y_500 > 6x10^-5 Mpc^2 clusters show a bimodal behavior

of Scholte waves and numerical aspects of modeling Scholte waves, including
analytical Cagniard-de Hoop analysis, the boundary integral method and a
staggered grid finite difference method. For simple media for which the Green's
function can be easily computed, the boundary element method produces accurate
results. The finite difference method shows strong numerical artifacts and
stagnant artificial waves can be seen in the vicinity of topography at the
fluid-solid interface even when using fine computational grids. However, the
amplitude of these artificial waves decays away from the seafloor. It is
sensible to place receivers away from the fluid-solid interface for seismic
modeling. To investigate Scholte wave generation, one needs to correctly
implement the fluid-solid boundary condition. It is also shown through
numerical examples including using a seafloor profile from the recent SEG
Advanced Modeling (SEAM) Project that even mild topographic features can
generate Scholte waves and these waves can be used to constrain near seafloor S
wave velocity by dispersion analysis of interface Scholte waves. The
implication to the full waveform inversion is that, although low frequency data
are crucial for convergence, seafloor topography may have a large effect on low

possess a sparse representation in some basis. Subsequent efforts have shown
that the performance of CS can be improved by exploiting additional structure
in the locations of the nonzero signal coefficients during inference, or by
utilizing some form of data-dependent adaptive measurement focusing during the
sensing process. To our knowledge, our own previous work was the first to
establish the potential benefits that can be achieved when fusing the notions
of adaptive sensing and structured sparsity -- that work examined the task of
support recovery from noisy linear measurements, and established that an
adaptive sensing strategy specifically tailored to signals that are tree-sparse

are agnostic to the underlying structure. In this work we establish fundamental
performance limits for the task of support recovery of tree-sparse signals from

initial CS investigations) or by any adaptive sensing strategy. Our main

achieved for some spatially curved FRW manifolds where the singularity is
replaced by a de Sitter stage or a big bounce of the scale factor depending on

deforming vacuum general relativistic solutions.

strictly convex. It can identify important groups as well as select important
variables within the group. We develop an efficient group-level coordinate

compare this quantity to two measures of source compactness: structure index,
which probes structure on milliarcsecond scales; and the presence of
interstellar scintillation associated with the quasar, which probes scales of
tens of microarcseconds.
  We find that persistent scintillators have greater position stability than
episodic scintillators, which are in turn more stable than non-scintillators.
Scintillators are also more likely to be compact on milliarcsecond scales, as
measured by the structure index. Persistent scintillators are therefore
excellent candidates for inclusion in any future realisation of the celestial
reference frame. A list of these sources is presented in the Appendix.
  We find that slow (characteristic timescale >3 days) scintillators have more

High-cadence, long term monitoring is therefore required to identify other

relating the size of the unfolded state of the biopolymer and the number of
amino acids. The predicted power law dependence is confirmed in simulations of
the dependence of the isothermal extensibility and the fraction of native
contacts on $\varphi_c$. We also show using MC simulations that $F_c$ is
linearly dependent on the average osmotic pressure ($\mathrm{P}$) exerted by
the crowding agents on the \beta-hairpin. The highly significant linear
correlation coefficient of 0.99657 between $F_c$ and $\mathrm{P}$ makes it
straightforward to predict the dependence of the critical force on the density
of crowders. Our predictions are amenable to experimental verification using
Laser Optical Tweezers.

low redshifts are dominated by quiescent galaxies, but we find that quiescent
galaxies and star forming galaxies co-exist in this z=2 system. Interestingly,
the quiescent galaxies form a weak red sequence in the process of forming. By
stacking the spectra of star forming galaxies, we observe strong emission lines

confirming the quiescent nature of these galaxies. We then perform detailed

exchange messages through a single relay using a physical-layer network coding
(PNC) based protocol. The protocol comprises two phases of communication. In
the multiple access (MA) phase, two users transmit their modulated signals
concurrently to the relay, and in the broadcast (BC) phase, the relay
broadcasts a network-coded (denoised) signal to both users. Nonbinary and
binary network codes are considered for uniform and nonuniform pulse amplitude
modulation (PAM) adopted in the MA phase, respectively. We examine the effect
of different choices of symbol mapping (i.e., mapping from the denoised signal
to the modulation symbols at the relay) and bit mapping (i.e., mapping from the
modulation symbols to the source bits at the user) on the system error-rate
performance. A general optimization framework is proposed to determine the
optimal symbol/bit mappings with joint consideration of noisy transmissions in
both communication phases. Complexity-reduction techniques are developed for
solving the optimization problems. It is shown that the optimal symbol/bit
mappings depend on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the channel and the
modulation scheme. A general strategy for choosing good symbol/bit mappings is
also presented based on a high-SNR analysis, which suggests using a symbol
mapping that aligns the error patterns in both communication phases and Gray
and binary bit mappings for uniform and nonuniform PAM, respectively.

long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) with the star formation history (SFH) to compare
the predictions of $\Lambda$CDM with those in the $R_{\rm h}=ct$ Universe. In
the context of the former, we confirm that the latest Swift sample of GRBs
reveals an increasing evolution in the GRB rate relative to the star formation
rate (SFR) at high redshifts. The observed discrepancy between the GRB rate and
the SFR may be eliminated by assuming a modest evolution parameterized as
$(1+z)^{0.8}$---perhaps indicating a cosmic evolution in metallicity. However,
we find a higher metallicity cut of $Z=0.52Z_{\odot}$ than was seen in previous
studies, which suggested that LGRBs occur preferentially in metal poor
environments, i.e., $Z\sim0.1-0.3Z_{\odot}$. We use a simple power-law
approximation to the high-\emph{z} ($\ga 3.8$) SFH, i.e., $R_{\rm
SF}\propto[(1+z)/4.8]^{\alpha}$, to examine how the high-\emph{z} SFR may be
impacted by a possible abundance evolution in the Swift GRB sample. For an
expansion history consistent with $\Lambda$CDM, we find that the Swift redshift
and luminosity distributions can be reproduced with reasonable accuracy if
$\alpha=-2.41_{-2.09}^{+1.87}$. For the $R_{\rm h}=ct$ Universe, the GRB rate
is slightly different from that in $\Lambda$CDM, but also requires an extra
evolutionary effect, with a metallicity cut of $Z=0.44Z_{\odot}$. Assuming that
the SFR and GRB rate are related via an evolving metallicity, we find that the
GRB data constrain the slope of the high-\emph{z} SFR in $R_{\rm h}=ct$ to be
$\alpha=-3.60_{-2.45}^{+2.45}$. Both cosmologies fit the GRB/SFR data rather
well.

Generation (LCG), uses resolution to derive nogoods expressing the reasons for

producing exponential speedups on a wide variety of problems. Nogood learning
solvers can be seen as resolution proof systems. The stronger the proof system,
the faster it can solve a CP problem. It has recently been shown that the proof
system used in LCG is at least as strong as general resolution. However,
stronger proof systems such as \emph{extended resolution} exist. Extended
resolution allows for literals expressing arbitrary logical concepts over
existing variables to be introduced and can allow exponentially smaller proofs
than general resolution. The primary problem in using extended resolution is to
figure out exactly which literals are useful to introduce. In this paper, we
show that we can use the structural information contained in a CP model in

computational biology. The most successful computational approach, also called
template-based modeling, identifies templates with solved crystal structures
for the query proteins and constructs three dimensional models based on
sequence/structure alignments. Although substantial effort has been made to
improve protein sequence alignment, the accuracy of alignments between
distantly related proteins is still unsatisfactory. In this thesis, I will
introduce a number of statistical machine learning methods to build accurate
alignments between a protein sequence and its template structures, especially
for proteins having only distantly related templates. For a protein with only
one good template, we develop a regression-tree based Conditional Random Fields
(CRF) model for pairwise protein sequence/structure alignment. By learning a
nonlinear threading scoring function, we are able to leverage the correlation
among different sequence and structural features. We also introduce an
information-theoretic measure to guide the learning algorithm to better exploit
the structural features for low-homology proteins with little evolutionary
information in their sequence profile. For a protein with multiple good
templates, we design a probabilistic consistency approach to thread the protein
to all templates simultaneously. By minimizing the discordance between the
pairwise alignments of the protein and templates, we are able to construct a
multiple sequence/structure alignment, which leads to better structure
predictions than any single-template based prediction.

causes of the observed 11-year and 22-year cycles and charge-sign dependent
modulation. Illustrative examples of some of the theoretical and observational

description with highly accurate hydrodynamic bead models to evaluate the
normalized velocity and turning angles for a worm swimming in an unconfined

and navigates more effectively under a strong confinement, due to the large
transverse-to-longitudinal resistance-coefficient ratio resulting from the
wall-mediated far-field hydrodynamic coupling between body segments. We also
note that the optimal swimming gait is similar to the gait observed for
nematodes swimming in high-viscosity fluids. Our bead models allow us to
determine the effects of confinement and finite thickness of the body of the
nematode on its locomotion. These effects are not accounted for by the
classical resistive-force and slender-body theories.

infinite, homogeneous, self-gravitating medium supported by pressure. Most
realistic astrophysical systems, however, are not isolated - instead they are
under the influence of an external field such as the tidal field due to a
neighbour. Here we do a linear perturbation analysis for a system in an
external field, and obtain a generalized dispersion relation that depends on
the wavenumber, the sound speed, and also the magnitude of the tidal field. A
typical, disruptive tidal field is shown to make the system more stable against
perturbations, and results in a higher effective Jeans wavelength. The minimum
mass that can become unstable is then higher (super-Jeans) than the usual Jeans
mass. Conversely, in a compressive tidal field, perturbations can grow even
when the mass is lower (sub-Jeans). This approach involving the inclusion of
tidal field opens up a new way of looking at instabilities in gravitating
systems. The treatment is general and the simple analytical form of the
modified Jeans criterion obtained makes it easily accessible.

from a singlet configuration, S, in which the spins of the pair-partners are
entangled, makes this dynamics highly nontivial. Namely, as the amplitude, B1,
of the driving field grows, mixing all of the triplet components, the
long-living modes do not disappear, but evolve from T+, T- into (T+ +/- sqrt(2)
T0 + T-)/2. Upon further increase of B1, the lifetime of the S-mode is cut in
half, while the T0-mode transforms into an antisymmetric combination (T- -
T-)/sqrt(2) and acquires a long lifetime, in full analogy to the superradiant
and subradiant modes in the Dicke effect. Peculiar spin dynamics translates
into a peculiar dependence on B1. In particular, at small B1, the
radiation-induced correction to the current is linear in B1.

ultraviolet (UV), optical, through the near- and mid-infrared (IR) has been
studied extensively. Although it is well established that the UV/optical
extinction law varies significantly among the different lines of sight, it is
not clear how the IR extinction varies among various environments. In this
work, using the color-excess method and taking red giants as the extinction
tracer, we determine the interstellar extinction Alambda in the four
Spitzer/IRAC bands of the Coalsack nebula, a nearby starless dark cloud, based
on the data obtained from the 2MASS and Spitzer/GLIMPSE surveys. We select five
individual regions across the nebula that span a wide variety of physical
conditions, ranging from diffuse, translucent to dense environments, as traced
by the visual extinction, the Spitzer/MIPS 24micron emission, and CO emission.
We find that Alambda/AKs, the mid-IR extinction relative to AKs, decreases from
diffuse to dense environments, which may be explained in terms of ineffective
dust growth in dense regions. The mean extinction (relative to AKs) is
calculated for the four IRAC bands as well, which exhibits a flat mid-IR
extinction law, consistent with previous determinations for other regions. The
extinction in the IRAC 4.5micron band is anomalously high, much higher than
that of the other three IRAC bands. It cannot be explained in terms of CO and
CO2 ices. The mid-IR extinction in the four IRAC bands have also been derived
for four representative regions in the Coalsack Globule 2 which respectively
exhibit strong ice absorption, moderate or weak ice absorption, and very weak
or no ice absorption. The derived mid-IR extinction curves are all flat, with
Alambda/AKs increasing with the decrease of the H2O ice absorption optical

method used to derive precise proper motion measurements, using the Pleiades
cluster as a test bench. Combining deep wide field multi-epoch panchromatic

proper motions for the sources present in the field of the survey. The datasets
cover ~80 square degrees, centered around the Seven Sisters. Using new tools,
we have computed a catalog of 6116907 unique sources, including proper motion
measurements for 3577478 of them. The catalogue covers the magnitude range
between i=12~24mag, achieving a proper motion accuracy <1mas/yr for sources as

alternative to parametric central-tendency statistics to normalize observed
citation counts. Percentiles are based on an ordered set of citation counts in
a reference set, whereby the fraction of papers at or below the citation counts
of a focal paper is used as an indicator for its relative citation impact in
the set. In this study, we pursue two related objectives: (1) although
different percentile-based approaches have been developed, an approach is
hitherto missing that satisfies a number of criteria such as scaling of the
percentile ranks from zero (all other papers perform better) to 100 (all other
papers perform worse), and solving the problem with tied citation ranks
unambiguously. We introduce a new citation-rank approach having these
properties, namely P100. (2) We compare the reliability of P100 empirically
with other percentile-based approaches, such as the approaches developed by the
SCImago group, the Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS), and
Thomson Reuters (InCites), using all papers published in 1980 in Thomson
Reuters Web of Science (WoS). How accurately can the different approaches
predict the long-term citation impact in 2010 (in year 31) using citation
impact measured in previous time windows (years 1 to 30)? The comparison of the
approaches shows that the method used by InCites overestimates citation impact
(because of using the highest percentile rank when papers are assigned to more
than a single subject category) whereas the SCImago indicator shows higher
power in predicting the long-term citation impact on the basis of citation
rates in early years. Since the results show a disadvantage in this predictive
ability for P100 against the other approaches, there is still room for further

  Approximations for Mixed Formulations of Quasi-Variational Inequalities","32 pages",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Similar evolutionary variational and quasi-variational inequalities with
gradient constraints arise in the modeling of growing sandpiles and type-II
superconductors. Recently, mixed formulations of these inequalities were used
for establishing existence results in the quasi-variational inequality case.
Such formulations, and this is an additional advantage, made it possible to
determine numerically not only the primal variables, e.g. the evolving sand
surface and the magnetic field for sandpiles and superconductors, respectively,
but also the dual variables, the sand flux and the electric field.
  Numerical approximations of these mixed formulations in previous works
employed the Raviart--Thomas element of the lowest order. Here we introduce
simpler numerical approximations of these mixed formulations based on the
nonconforming linear finite element. We prove (subsequence) convergence of
these approximations, and illustrate their effectiveness by numerical
experiments.

unsolved problem concerning the pathwise strong approximation of stochastic
differential equations with respect to the global error in the
$L_{\infty}$-norm. Typically, one has average supnorm error of order $\left(\ln
k/k\right)^{1/2}$ for standard approximations of SDEs with $k$ discretization
points, like piecewise interpolated Ito-Taylor schemes. On the other hand there
is a lower bound, which indicates that the order $1/\sqrt{k}$ is best possible
for spline approximation of SDEs with $k$ free knots. The present paper deals
with the question of how to get an implementable method, which achieves the
order $1/\sqrt{k}$. Up to now, papers with regard to this issue give only pure
existence results and so are inappropriate for practical use. In this paper we
introduce a nonlinear method for approximating a scalar SDE. The method
combines a Milstein scheme with a pieceweise linear interpolation of the
Brownian motion with free knots and is easy to implement. Moreover, we
establish sharp lower and upper error bounds with specified constants which
exhibit the influence of the coefficients of the equation.

$\Sigma$ be a compact connected and orientable surface immersed in $M$ which is
a stable constant mean curvature (CMC) surface or an index one minimal surface.
We prove that $\Sigma$ is homeomorphic either to a sphere or to a torus.
Moreover, in case $\Sigma$ is homeomorphic to a torus, then it is embedded,
minimal, conformal to a flat square torus and Ric$(N)=0$ where $N$ is a unit
field normal to $\Sigma.$ The result is sharp, we can perturb the standard
metric on the 3-sphere in its conformal class to obtain metrics of nonnegative
Ricci curvature admitting minimal tori which are stable as CMC surfaces.

Rampf {\it et al.} that there exist distinct collapse and crystallization

infinity, both transition temperatures converge to the same $T^*$, i.e.
infinitely long polymers collapse immediately into a solid state. We explain
this by the observation that polymers crystallize in the Rampf {\it et al.}

Frank-Kasper structure) which has many degenerate ground states and, as a
consequence, Bloch walls. If one controlls the polymer growth such that only
one ground state is populated and Bloch walls are completely avoided, the
liquid-solid transition is a smooth cross-over without any sharp transition at

stability considerations, the low Higgs mass and the large top-quark Yukawa

leaves the portion of orbit traversed by interstellar He atoms. We identify
seasons during the year when mostly the genuine interstellar D atoms are

detectable interstellar D atoms are expected. This number is comparable with
the expected number of sputtered D atoms registered during the same time

Coherent state probes, which are practical and feasible, give exponential
improvement in the discrimination of the Unruh channel and come very close to
optimal. In particular, we show that using a short pulse laser, the
accelerations required to test the Unruh effect can be reduced by at least
three orders of magnitude with the same statistical confidence as could be
achieved in vacuum. These results are expected to be relevant to upcoming
experimental tests of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes in analogue
systems.

consider $\phi$-mixing systems and prove a result connecting the R\'enyi

which is collimated in a cone before the scattering off relativistic electrons

would remove the synchrotron model problems of the X-ray emission: of
acceleration of the emitting electrons to extreme Lorenz factors $\gamma >

in the synchrotron radio and X-ray bands. Our study of the comptonization model
showed up that in the case of the minimal factor $\gamma_{\rm min}$ of the

photons, is close to or exceeds total energy of the nebula - the case of
inapplicability of the model. In the case of $\gamma_{\rm min} > 10$ the cone
emission is comptonized beyond the 1 - 10\,keV band, consequently the existing
observational data are non-sensitive to the emission cone.

Our results demonstrate that several factors can cause an appreciable

The symmetry energy of the effective interaction has little influence upon its

introduced in the transmitter and receiver radio frequency chains and severely
degrades the performance of communication systems. We study the effect of
oscillator phase noise in frequency-selective Massive MIMO systems with
imperfect channel state information (CSI). In particular, we consider two
distinct operation modes, namely when the phase noise processes at the $M$ BS

(non-synchronous operation). We analyze a linear and low-complexity
time-reversal maximum-ratio combining (TR-MRC) reception strategy. For both

their performance. Based on the derived achievable sum-rates, we show that with
the proposed receive processing an $O(\sqrt{M})$ array gain is achievable. Due
to the phase noise drift the estimated effective channel becomes progressively
outdated. Therefore, phase noise effectively limits the length of the interval
used for data transmission and the number of scheduled users. The derived
achievable rates provide insights into the optimum choice of the data interval

ellipticity of a non-barotropic neutron star with (i) a quadrupole
poloidal-toroidal field, and (ii) a purely poloidal field containing arbitrary

lowest energy, and that l=5 has the lowest ellipticity. We show how a mixed

principal axes of inertia (to be inferred from gravitational wave data) and the
magnetic inclination angle. Strong quadrupole and octupole components (with

Ising model on (Z/L)^2 (the square lattice with lattice spacing 1/L) with
initial condition such that \sigma_x=-1 if x\in D and \sigma_x=+ otherwise. We
prove the following classical conjecture due to H. Spohn: In the diffusive
limit where time is rescaled by L^2 and L tends to infinity, the boundary of
the droplet of ""-"" spins follows a deterministic anisotropic curve-shortening
flow, such that the normal velocity is given by the local curvature times an
explicit function of the local slope. Locally, in a suitable reference frame,
the evolution of the droplet boundary follows the one-dimensional heat
equation. To our knowledge, this is the first proof of mean curvature-type
droplet shrinking for a lattice model with genuine microscopic dynamics. An
important ingredient is our recent work, where the case of convex D was solved.
The other crucial point in the proof is obtaining precise regularity estimates

methods to perform parameter inference from partially observed network models.
In particular, we consider the duplication attachment (DA) model which has a
likelihood function that typically cannot be evaluated in any reasonable
computational time. We consider a number of importance sampling (IS) and
sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods for approximating the likelihood of the
network model for a fixed parameter value. It is well-known that for IS, the
relative variance of the likelihood estimate typically grows at an exponential
rate in the time parameter (here this is associated to the size of the
network): we prove that, under assumptions, the SMC method will have relative
variance which can grow only polynomially. In order to perform parameter
estimation, we develop particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) algorithms to
perform Bayesian inference. Such algorithms use the afore-mentioned SMC
algorithms within the transition dynamics. The approaches are illustrated
numerically.

regulates the amount of degrees of freedom used in the fit. In this paper we
propose data-driven methods for selecting smoothing parameters when the

estimate the exact expression of the mean squared error of the estimators.
Asymptotic approximations indicate that the smoothing parameters minimizing
this mean squared error converges to zero faster than the optimal smoothing

observed in the near- and mid-infrared from the NIRS0S and the S4G surveys. I
used archival far-ultraviolet (FUV) and H\alpha\ imaging of 319 galaxies to
diagnose whether their inner rings are passive or active. I found that passive
rings are found only in early-type disc galaxies (-3<=T<=2). In this range of
stages, 21+-3% and 28+-5% of the rings are passive according to the FUV and
H\alpha\ indicators, respectively. A ring that is passive according to the FUV
is always passive according to H\alpha, but the reverse is not always true.
Ring-lenses form 30-40% of passive rings, which is four times more than the
fraction of ring-lenses found in active rings in the stage range -3<=T<=2. This
is consistent with both a resonance and a manifold origin for the rings because
both models predict purely stellar rings to be wider than their star-forming
counterparts. In the case of resonance rings, the widening may be at least
partly due to the dissolution of rings. If most inner rings have a resonance
origin, I estimate 200Myr to be a lower bound for their dissolution time-scale.
This time-scale is of the order of one orbital period at the radius of inner
rings.

the F-behaviour in GC stars and to look for new constraints on the formation
histories of their multiple stellar populations. We have collected near-IR
spectra of 15 RGB stars belonging to GC spanning a wide range of metallicity:
47 Tuc, M4, NGC6397 and M30. F, Na and Fe abundances have been estimated by
spectral synthesis. No anticorrelation between F and Na abundances are found
for the most metal-rich cluster of the sample (47 Tuc). In this GC, RGB stars
indeed exhibit rather small differences in [F/Fe] unlike the larger ones found
for the [Na/Fe] ratios. This reveals a rather inhomogeneous stellar system and
a complex chemical evolution history for 47 Tuc . In M4, one star of our study
confirms the previous Na-F distribution reported by another group in 2005. For
the two very metal-poor GC (NGC6397 and M30), only upper limits of F abundances
have been derived. We show that F abundances could be estimated in such
metal-poor GC with current telescopes and spectrographs only if unexpected
F-rich giants are found and/or exceptional observational conditions are met.
The distribution of the F and Na abundances in GC reveal that their RGB members
seem to belong to two well-separated regions. All the RGB stars analysed so far
in the different GC are indeed found to be either F-rich Na-poor or F-poor
Na-rich. Such well-separated bimodal regimes are consistent with the separate

development. On contrary to the classical stochastic reserving techniques, the
number of model parameters does not depend on the number of development
periods, which leads to a more precise forecasting.
  Moreover, the time series innovations for the consecutive claims are not
considered to be independent anymore. Conditional least squares are used for
model parameter estimation and consistency of such estimate is proved. Copula

diseases in a population. Containment strategies are usually devised on
movement scenarios based on coarse-grained assumptions. Mobility phone data
provide a unique opportunity for building models and defining strategies based
on very precise information about the movement of people in a region or in a
country. Another very important aspect is the underlying social structure of a
population, which might play a fundamental role in devising information
campaigns to promote vaccination and preventive measures, especially in
countries with a strong family (or tribal) structure.
  In this paper we analyze a large-scale dataset describing the mobility and
the call patterns of a large number of individuals in Ivory Coast. We present a
model that describes how diseases spread across the country by exploiting
mobility patterns of people extracted from the available data. Then, we
simulate several epidemics scenarios and we evaluate mechanisms to contain the
epidemic spreading of diseases, based on the information about people mobility
and social ties, also gathered from the phone call data. More specifically, we
find that restricting mobility does not delay the occurrence of an endemic
state and that an information campaign based on one-to-one phone conversations
among members of social groups might be an effective countermeasure.

a system involving doubly hypergeometric series. We derive from this system

proved to hold for the more general Potts model on 3-valent maps, but via a

drag reduction, non-sinusoidal oscillations of a solid wall are considered as a
means to alter the skin-friction drag in a turbulent channel flow. A series of
Direct Numerical Simulations is conducted to evaluate the control performance
of nine different temporal waveforms, in addition to the usual sinusoid,
systematically changing the wave amplitude and the period for each waveform.
  The turbulent average spanwise motion is found to coincide with the laminar
Stokes solution that is constructed, for the generic waveform, through harmonic
superposition. This allows us to define and compute, for each waveform, a new
penetration depth of the Stokes layer which correlates with the amount of
turbulent drag reduction, and eventually to predict both turbulent drag
reduction and net energy saving rate for arbitrary waveforms.
  Among the waveforms considered, the maximum net energy saving rate is
obtained by the sinusoidal wave at its optimal amplitude and period. However,
the sinusoid is not the best waveform at every point in the parameter space.
Our predictive tool offers simple guidelines to design waveforms that
outperform the sinusoid for given (suboptimal) amplitude and period of
oscillation. This is potentially interesting in view of applications, where
physical limitations often preclude the actuator to reach its optimal operating
conditions.

  We consider the turbulent cascade of whistler modes. We show that (i)
harmonic whistlers are exact non-linear solutions; (ii) co-linear whistlers do
not interact (including counter-propagating); (iii) waves with the same value
of the wave vector, $k_1=k_2$, do not interact; (iv) whistler modes have a
dispersion that allows a three-wave decay, including into a zero frequency
mode; (v) the three-wave interaction effectively couples modes with highly
different wave numbers and propagation angles. In addition, linear interaction
of a whistler with a single zero-mode can lead to spatially divergent
structures via parametric instability. All these properties are drastically
different from MHD, so that the qualitative properties of the Alfven turbulence
cannot be transferred to the EMHD turbulence.
  We derive the Hamiltonian formulation of EMHD, and using Bogolyubov
transformation reduce it to the canonical form; we calculate the matrix
elements for the three-wave interaction of whistlers. We solve numerically the
kinetic equation and show that, generally, the EMHD cascade develops within a
broad range of angles, while transiently it may show anisotropic, nearly two
dimensional structures. Development of a cascade depends on the forcing
(non-universal) and often fails to reach a steady state. Analytical estimates
predict the spectrum of magnetic fluctuations for the quasi-isotropic cascade
$\propto k^{-2}$. The cascade remains weak (not critically-balanced). The
cascade is UV-local, while the infrared locality is weakly (logarithmically)
violated.

one of the most expensive and error-prone tasks in the software development
process. To improve the debugging process efficiency, some effort was already
made to automatically assist the detection and location of software faults.
This led to the creation of statistical debugging tools such as Tarantula,
Zoltar and GZoltar. These tools use information gathered from code coverage
data and the result of test executions to return a list of potential faulty
locations. Although helpful, fault localization tools have some scaling
problems because of the fine-grained coverage data they need to perform the
fault localization analysis. Instrumentation overhead, which in some cases can
be as high as 50% is the main cause for their inefficiency. This thesis
proposes a new approach to this problem, avoiding as much as possible the high
level of coverage detail, while still using the proven techniques these fault
localization tools employ. This approach, named DCC, consists of using a
coarser initial instrumentation, obtaining only coverage traces for large
components. Then, the instrumentation detail of certain components is
progressively increased, based on the intermediate results provided by the same
techniques employed in current fault localization tools. To assess the validity
of our proposed approach, an empirical evaluation was performed, injecting
faults in four real-world software projects. The empirical evaluation
demonstrates that the DCC approach reduces the execution overhead that exists
in spectrum-based fault localization, and even presents a more concise
potential fault ranking to the user. We have observed execution time reductions
of 27% on average and diagnostic report size reductions of 63% on average.

the oversampling rate $m/k$. Here the quantization scheme is assumed to be
chosen appropriately depending on the oversampling rate and the quantization
alphabet can be coarse. The result holds with high probability on the draw of
the frame uniformly for all signals. The crux of the argument is a bound on the
extreme singular values of the product of a deterministic matrix and a

show polynomial error decay in the context of compressed sensing. Our results
extend previous results for structured deterministic frame expansions and

vacuum in our Universe may be unstable. We analyze properties of unstable
vacuum states from the point of view of the quantum theory of unstable states.
From the literature it is known that some of false vacuum states may survive up
to times when their survival probability has a non-exponential form. At times
much latter than the transition time, when contributions to the survival
probability of its exponential and non-exponential parts are comparable, the
survival probability as a function of time $t$ has an inverse power-like form.
We show that at this time region the instantaneous energy of the false vacuum
states tends to the energy of the true vacuum state as $1/t^{2}$ for $t \to
\infty$. Properties of the instantaneous energy at transition times are also
analyzed for a given model. It is shown that at this time region large and

core begins to accrete gas directly from the nebula when its mass reaches about
5 earth masses. The protoplanet has at most a few million years to reach
runaway gas accretion, as young stars lose their gas disks after 10 million
years at the latest. Yet gas accretion also brings small dust grains entrained
in the gas into the planetary atmosphere. Dust accretion creates an optically
thick protoplanetary atmosphere that cannot efficiently radiate away the
kinetic energy deposited by incoming planetesimals. A dust-rich atmosphere
severely slows down atmospheric cooling, contraction, and inflow of new gas, in
contradiction to the observed timescales of planet formation. Here we show that
photophoresis is a strong mechanism for pushing dust out of the planetary
atmosphere due to the momentum exchange between gas and dust grains. The
thermal radiation from the heated inner atmosphere and core is sufficient to
levitate dust grains and to push them outward. Photophoresis can significantly
accelerate the formation of giant planets.

Predictions of forecoming solar cycles mean amplitude and duration are

predictability window of a representative, advection-dominated, flux-transport
dynamo model by investigating its sensitivity to initial conditions and control

the exponential growth of an initial perturbation of the model trajectory,
which yields a characteristic time scale known as the e-folding time $\tau_e$.
The e-folding time is shown to decrease with the strength of the
$\alpha$-effect, and to increase with the magnitude of the imposed meridional
circulation. Comparing the e-folding time with the solar cycle periodicity, we
obtain an average estimate for $\tau_e$ equal to 2.76 solar cycle durations.
From a practical point of view, the perturbations analysed in this work can be
interpreted as uncertainties affecting either the observations or the physical
model itself. After reviewing these, we discuss their implications for solar
cycle prediction.

peak has been attributed to a pseudogap at the Fermi surface but a detailed

linear conductivity, which seems to be universal in all Al based icosahedral

simple model that assumes that the entire Fermi surface is gapped except at a
finite set of Dirac points. There is no evidence of a semiconducting gap in any
of the materials suggesting that the Dirac spectrum is massless, protected by
topology leading to a Weyl semimetal. This model gives rise to a linear
conductivity with only one parameter, the Fermi velocity. This picture suggests
that decagonal quasicrystals should, like graphene, have a frequency
independent conductivity, without a Drude peak. This is in accord with the

debris disks are thus ideal environments for studying the earliest stages of
non-accretion-driven coronae. In this paper we simulate the corona of AU Mic, a
nearby active M dwarf with an edge-on debris disk. We apply a self-consistent
model of coronal loop heating that was derived from numerical simulations of

synthesize the modeled star's X-ray luminosity and thermal radio/millimeter

changing the local magnetic shear, it is prudent to plan to use a complementary
scheme which directly decreases the potential energy of the kink mode in order
to reduce the sawtooth period. In the event that the natural sawtooth period is
longer than expected, due to enhanced alpha particle stabilisation for
instance, this ancillary sawtooth control can be provided from > 10MW of ion

exploit the smoothness of a function for numerical integration and to achieve
an improved rate of convergence as compared to classical digital nets and
sequences for smooth functions. A construction principle of higher order
digital nets and sequences based on a digit interlacing function was introduced
in [J. Dick, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 45 (2007) pp.~2141--2176], which interlaces
classical digital nets or sequences whose number of components is a multiple of
the dimension.
  In this paper, we study the use of polynomial lattice point sets for
interlaced components. We call quadrature rules using such point sets {\em
interlaced polynomial lattice rules}. We consider weighted Walsh spaces
containing smooth functions and derive two upper bounds on the worst-case error
for interlaced polynomial lattice rules, both of which can be employed as a
quality criterion for the construction of interlaced polynomial lattice rules.
We investigate the component-by-component construction and the Korobov
construction as a means of explicit constructions of good interlaced polynomial
lattice rules that achieve the optimal rate of the worst-case error. Through
this approach we are able to obtain a good dependence of the worst-case error
bounds on the dimension under certain conditions on the weights, while
significantly reducing the construction cost as compared to higher order
polynomial lattice rules.

them, GRB 081007, also shows a spectroscopically confirmed supernova, SN
2008hw, which resembles SN 1998bw in its absorption features, while the maximum
luminosity is only about half as large as that of SN 1998bw. Bright optical
flashes have been detected in both events, which allows us to derive solid
constraints on the circumburst-matter density profile. This is particularly
interesting in the case of GRB 081007, whose afterglow is found to be
propagating into a constant-density medium, yielding yet another example of a
GRB clearly associated with a massive star progenitor which did not sculpt the
surroundings with its stellar wind. There is no supernova component detected in
the afterglow of GRB 090424, likely due to the brightness of the host galaxy,
comparable to the Milky Way. We show that the afterglow data are consistent
with the presence of both forward- and reverse-shock emission powered by
relativistic outflows expanding into the interstellar medium. The absence of
optical peaks due to the forward shock strongly suggests that the reverse shock
regions should be mildly magnetized. The initial Lorentz factor of outflow of
GRB 081007 is estimated to be \Gamma ~ 200, while for GRB 090424 a lower limit
of \Gamma > 170 is derived. We also discuss the prompt emission of GRB 081007,
which consists of just a single pulse. We argue that neither the external
forward-shock model nor the shock-breakout model can account for the prompt
emission data and suggest that the single-pulse-like prompt emission may be due
to magnetic energy dissipation of a Poynting-flux dominated outflow or to a
dissipative photosphere.

is applied to derive two scalar equations that govern the nonlinear evolution
of the Alfvenic and pseudo-Alfvenic components of ideal incompressible
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) plasma turbulence. The mathematical form of these
equations makes clear the inherently three-dimensional nature of plasma
turbulence, enabling an analysis of the nonlinear properties of two-dimensional
limits often used to study plasma turbulence. In the anisotropic limit k_perp
>>k_parallel that naturally arises in magnetized plasma systems, the
perpendicular 2D limit retains the dominant nonlinearities that are mediated
only by the Alfvenic fluctuations but lacks the wave physics associated with
the linear term that is necessary to capture the anisotropic cascade of
turbulent energy. In the in-plane 2D limit, the nonlinear energy transfer is
controlled instead by the pseudo-Alfven waves, with the Alfven waves relegated
to a passive role. In the oblique 2D limit, an unavoidable azimuthal dependence
connecting the wavevector components will likely cause artificial azimuthal
asymmetries in the resulting turbulent dynamics. Therefore, none of these 2D
limits is sufficient to capture fully the rich three-dimensional nonlinear
dynamics critical to the evolution of plasma turbulence.

3-space, parameterized by arc length $s$, with torsion $\tau $ and length $l$.
The total square torsion $H$ of $\alpha $ is defined by $% H=\int_{0}^{l}\tau
^{2}ds$. The arc is called a relaxed elastic line of second kind if it is an
extremal for the variational problem of minimizing the value of $H$ within the
family of all arcs of length $l$ on $S$ having the same initial point and
initial direction as $\alpha $. In this study, we obtain differential equation
and boundary conditions for a relaxed elastic line of second kind on an
oriented surface in Minkowski 3-space.

  Mention in USP Thesis Award 2013"". File info: 214 pages, 44 figures, 14
  tables",,,,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this thesis, the QCD sum rules approach has been used to study the nature
of the following charmonium resonances: Y(3930), Y(4140), X(4350), Y(4260),
Y(4360) and Y(4660). There is a strong evidence that these states have
non-conventional (or exotic) hadronic structures since their respective masses
and decay channels observed experimentally are inconsistent with expected for a
conventional charmonium state. The same phenomenon occurs on the bottomonium
sector, where new states like Yb(10890) and Yb(11020) observed recently could
indicate the existence of new bottomonium exotic states. In this way, one
verifies that the Y(4140) state could be described as a D*sD*s (0++) molecular
state or even as a mixture of D*sD*s (0++) and D*D* (0++) molecular states. For
the Y(3930) and X(4350) states, both cannot be described as a D*D* (0++) and
D*sD*s0 (1-+), respectively. From the sum rule point of view, the Y(4660) state
could be described as a \psi' f0(980) molecular state. The extension to the
bottomonium sector is done in a straightforward way to demonstrate that the
\Upsilon' f0(980) molecular state is a good candidate for describing the
structure of the Yb(10890) state. In the following, one estimates the mass of
the exotic Bc-like molecular states using the sum rule approach, where these
new exotic states would correspond to bound states of D(*) and B(*) mesons. All
of these mass predictions could (or not) be checked in a near future
experiments at LHC. A large study using the Double Ratio of Sum Rules approach
has been evaluated for studying the heavy baryon masses in QCD. The obtained
results for the unobserved heavy baryons, with one (Qqq) and two (QQq) heavy
quarks will be an excellent test for the capability of the sum rule approach in
predicting their masses.

large-scale data which are distributed over multiple hosts. This enables
modeling of nonlinear relationships and both the batch approach, where analysis
starts after all data have been collected, and the real-time setting are
addressed. The methodology is extended to operate in evolving environments,
where it can no longer be assumed that model parameters remain constant over
time. Two areas of application for the methodology are presented: regression
modeling when there are multiple data owners and regression modeling within the
MapReduce framework. A website, realtime-semiparametric-regression.net,
illustrates the use of the proposed method on United States domestic airline
data in real-time.

oscillators. Explicit expressions for the eigenstates and eigenvalues of
generalized Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian are presented. We exemplify our
physical model with analytical and numerical considerations regarding collapse
and revivals of the initial population of a two-level system and photon

studying giant dipole resonances and through them nuclear structure. Over a
long period, detailed theoretical models for the giant dipole resonances were
proposed and low energy electron accelerators were constructed to perform
experiments to test their veracity. More recently, through laser and ""smart""
material devices, electrons have been accelerated in condensed matter systems
up to several tens of MeV. We discuss here the possibility of inducing
electro-disintegration of nuclei through such devices. It involves a synthesis
of electromagnetic and strong forces in condensed matter via giant dipole
resonances to give an effective ""electro-strong interaction"" - a large coupling
of electromagnetic and strong interactions in the tens of MeV range.

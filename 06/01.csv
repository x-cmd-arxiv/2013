developed with the help of ordinary differential equation (ODE) models. These
models, however, are not effectively capable of representing problems involving
individual localisation, memory and emerging properties, which are common
characteristics of cells and molecules of the immune system. Agent-based
modelling and simulation is an alternative paradigm to ODE models that
overcomes these limitations. In this paper we investigate the potential
contribution of agent-based modelling and simulation when compared to ODE
modelling and simulation. We seek answers to the following questions: Is it
possible to obtain an equivalent agent-based model from the ODE formulation? Do
the outcomes differ? Are there any benefits of using one method compared to the
other? To answer these questions, we have considered three case studies using
established mathematical models of immune interactions with early-stage cancer.
These case studies were re-conceptualised under an agent-based perspective and
the simulation results were then compared with those from the ODE models. Our
results show that it is possible to obtain equivalent agent-based models (i.e.
implementing the same mechanisms); the simulation output of both types of
models however might differ depending on the attributes of the system to be
modelled. In some cases, additional insight from using agent-based modelling
was obtained. Overall, we can confirm that agent-based modelling is a useful
addition to the tool set of immunologists, as it has extra features that allow
for simulations with characteristics that are closer to the biological
phenomena.

of a formal definition, which could result in ambiguity for understanding the
algorithm. Moreover, previous investigations have mainly focused on its
empirical aspects. Therefore, it is necessary to provide a formal definition of
the algorithm, as well as to perform runtime analyses to revealits theoretical
aspects. In this paper, we define the deterministic version of the DCA, named
the dDCA, using set theory and mathematical functions. Runtime analyses of the
standard algorithm and the one with additional segmentation are performed. Our
analysis suggests that the standard dDCA has a runtime complexity of O(n2) for
the worst-case scenario, where n is the number of input data instances. The
introduction of segmentation changes the algorithm's worst case runtime
complexity to O(max(nN; nz)), for DC population size N with size of each
segment z. Finally, two runtime variables of the algorithm are formulated based
on the input data, to understand its runtime behaviour as guidelines for
further development.

which relates to wide applications. Many methods based on the global
information such as $k$-shell and PageRank have been applied to rank spreaders.
However, most of related previous works overwhelmingly focus on the number of
paths for propagation, while whether the paths are diverse enough is usually
overlooked. Generally, the spreading ability of a node might not be strong if
its propagation depends on one or two paths while the other paths are dead
ends. In this Letter, we introduced the concept of path diversity and find that
it can largely improve the ranking accuracy. We further propose a local method
combining the information of path number and path diversity to identify
influential nodes in complex networks. This method is shown to outperform many
well-known methods in both undirected and directed networks. Moreover, the
efficiency of our method makes it possible to be applied to very large systems.

the values of the reduced cumulants up to order $n=9$ are significantly
increased in $f(R)$ gravity for all our models at small scales $R\simlt

amplitudes is fastest at high and moderate redshifts $1\leq z \leq4$. The
growth of these deviations significantly slows down in the low redshift

effect of (anti)-symmetrization which introduces ""pseudo entanglement"" that is
inaccessible in practice. We show that, unlike the distinguishable particle
case, UEs exist for bosonic/fermionic systems with Hilbert spaces which are
symmetric (resp. antisymmetric) subspaces of
$\mathbb{C}^{d}\otimes\mathbb{C}^{d}$ if and only if $d\geq 3$ (resp. $d\geq
8$). To prove this we employ algebraic geometry to reason about the different
algebraic structures of the bosonic/fermionic systems. Additionally, due to the
relatively simple coherent state form of unentangled bosonic states, we are
able to give the explicit constructions of two bosonic UEs. Our investigation
provides insight into the entanglement properties of systems of
indisitinguishable particles, and in particular underscores the difference
between the entanglement structures of bosonic, fermionic and distinguishable
particle systems.

of excitons but also upon their linewidth and oscillator strength. At the same
time, a method is proposed that allows to evaluate the field and temperature

consists of two gas giant planets (c and d) with msin i = 0.65 MJup and 0.53
MJup orbiting with periods 975 and 2468 days, respectively. The two planets
appear to be in a 5:2 mean motion resonance, as this is required for the system
to be dynamically stable. A third planet with mass m_b sin i = 0.023 MJup
orbits close to the star with orbital period 9.37 days. Each planet orbit is
significantly eccentric, with current values estimated to be e_b = 0.39, e_c =
0.27 and e_d = 0.47. In this paper we assess different scenarios that may
explain the origin of these eccentric orbits, with particular focus on the
innermost body, noting that the large eccentricity of planet b cannot be
explained through secular interaction with the outer pair. We consider a
scenario in which the system previously contained an additional giant planet
that was ejected during a period of dynamical instability among the planets.
N-body simulations are presented that demonstrate that during scattering and
ejection among the outer planets a close encounter between a giant and the
inner body can raise e_b to its observed value. We consider the possibility
that an undetected planet in the system increases the secular forcing of planet
b by the exterior giant planets, but we find that the resulting eccentricity is
not large enough to agree with the observed one. We also consider a scenario in
which the spin-down of the central star causes the system to pass through
secular resonance. Spin-down rates below the critical value lead to longterm
capture of planet b in secular resonance, driving the eccentricity toward
unity. If additional short-period low mass planets are present in the system,
however, we find that mutual scattering can release planet b from the secular
resonance, leading to a system with orbital parameters similar to those
observed today.

signals imprinted in the clustering of matter. However, current galaxy and
quasar surveys cover limited portions of the sky, and are contaminated by
systematics that can mimic cosmological signatures and jeopardise the
interpretation of the measured power spectra. We provide a framework for
obtaining unbiased estimates of the angular power spectra of large-scale
structure surveys at the largest scales using quadratic estimators. The method
is tested by analysing the 600 CMASS mock catalogues constructed by Manera et
al. (2013) for the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). We then
consider the Richards et al. (2009) catalogue of photometric quasars from the
Sixth Data Release (DR6) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), which is known
to include significant stellar contamination and systematic uncertainties.
Focusing on the sample of ultraviolet-excess (UVX) sources, we show that the
excess clustering power present on the largest-scales can be largely mitigated
by making use of improved sky masks and projecting out the modes corresponding
to the principal systematics. In particular, we find that the sample of objects
with photometric redshift $1.3 < z_p < 2.2$ exhibits no evidence of
contamination when using our most conservative mask and mode projection. This
indicates that any residual systematics are well within the statistical
uncertainties. We conclude that, using our approach, this sample can be used
for cosmological studies.

result can be understood if neutron star and black hole kicks are a consequence
of large-scale asymmetries created in the supernova ejecta by the explosion
mechanism. The corresponding anisotropic gravitational attraction of the
asymmetrically expelled matter does not only accelerate new-born neutron stars
by the ""gravitational tug-boat mechanism"". It can also lead to delayed
black-hole formation by asymmetric fallback of the slowest parts of the initial
ejecta onto the transiently existing neutron star, in course of which the
momentum of the black hole can grow with the fallback mass. Black hole kick
velocities will therefore not be reduced by the ratio of neutron star to black
hole mass as would be expected for kicks caused by anisotropic neutrino
emission of the nascent neutron star.

suggests evolution of dust-to-gas ratios with redshift and lower average
metallicities for the higher redshift galaxies, consistent with current metal

the gas and radiation variables including the non-stiff source terms, and a
local implicit method to integrate the stiff source terms. We adopt the M1
closure relation and include all leading source terms. We employ the reduced
speed of light approximation (RSLA) with subcycling of the radiation variables

one, two, and three space dimensions and is parallelized using MPI. The
streaming and diffusion limits are well-described by the M1 closure model, and
our implementation shows excellent behavior for a problem with a concentrated
radiation source containing both regimes simultaneously. Our operator-split
method is ideally suited for problems with a slowly varying radiation field and
dynamical gas flows, in which the effect of the RSLA is minimal. We present an
analysis of the dispersion relation of RHD linear waves highlighting the
conditions of applicability for the RSLA. To demonstrate the accuracy of our
method, we utilize a suite of radiation and RHD tests covering a broad range of
regimes, including RHD waves, shocks, and equilibria, which show second-order
convergence in most cases. As an application, we investigate radiation-driven
ejection of a dusty, optically thick shell in the interstellar medium (ISM).
Finally, we compare the timing of our method with other well-known iterative
schemes for the RHD equations. Our code implementation, Hyperion, is suitable

constant (3.6-4.5) color for shorter-period Cepheids and may transition into a
bluer convex trough at longer-periods. The period-magnitude functions can be

theory with Dirichlet boundary conditions for fixed chemical potential. These
boundary conditions are obeyed by higher spin black holes. For each embedding
of sl(2,R) into sl(3,R), we show that the asymptotic symmetry group is
independent of the chemical potential. On the one hand, starting from AdS3 in
the principal embedding, we show that the W3 x W3 symmetry is preserved upon
turning on perturbatively spin 3 chemical potentials. On the other hand,
starting from AdS3 in the diagonal embedding, we show that the W3^(2) x W3^(2)
symmetry is preserved upon turning on finite spin 3/2 chemical potentials. We
also make connections between the canonical Lagrangian formalism and
integrability methods based on the third KdV (Boussinesq) hierarchy.

Comments very welcome",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201322007",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  According to the current standard model of Cosmology, matter in the Universe
arranges itself along a network of filamentary structure. These filaments
connect the main nodes of this so-called 'Cosmic Web', which are clusters of
galaxies. Although its large-scale distribution is clearly characterized by
numerical simulations, constraining the dark matter content of the cosmic web
in reality turns out to be difficult. The natural method of choice is
gravitational lensing. However, the direct detection and mapping of the elusive
filament signal is challenging and in this work we present two
methods,specifically tailored to achieve this task. A linear matched filter
aims at the detection of the smooth mass component of filaments and is
optimized to perform a shear decomposition that follows the anisotropic
component of the lensing signal. Filaments clearly inherit this property due to
their morphology. At the same time, the contamination arising from the central
massive cluster is controlled in a natural way. The filament 1 {\sigma}
detection is of about {\kappa} ~ 0.01-0.005 according to the filter's template
width and length, enabling the detection of structures out of reach with other
approaches. The second, complementary method seeks to detect the clumpy
component of filaments. The detection is determined by the number density of
sub-clump identifications in an area enclosing the potential filament, as it
was found within the observed field with the filter approach. We test both
methods against Mock observations based on realistic N-Body simulations of
filamentary structure and prove the feasibility of detecting filaments with
ground-based data.

permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus and present experimental results
describing dimensions of this complexity. The approach involves the transgenic
expression of a misfolded mutant of human preproinsulin, hINSC96Y, which is a
cause of the disease. When expressed in fly imaginal discs, hINSC96Y causes a
reduction of adult structures, including the eye, wing and notum. Eye imaginal
discs exhibit defects in both the structure and arrangement of ommatidia. In
the wing, expression of hINSC96Y leads to ectopic expression of veins and
mechano-sensory organs, indicating disruption of wild type signaling processes
regulating cell fates. These readily measurable disease phenotypes are
sensitive to temperature, gene dose and sex. Mutant (but not wild type)
proinsulin expression in the eye imaginal disc induces IRE1-mediated Xbp1
alternative splicing, a signal for endoplasmic reticulum stress response
activation, and produces global change in gene expression. Mutant hINS
transgene tester strains, when crossed to stocks from the Drosophila Genetic
Reference Panel produces F1 adults with a continuous range of disease
phenotypes and large broad-sense heritability. Surprisingly, the severity of
mutant hINS-induced disease in the eye is not correlated with that in the notum
in these crosses, nor with eye reduction phenotypes caused by the expression of
two dominant eye mutants acting in two different eye development pathways, Drop
(Dr) or Lobe (L) when crossed into the same genetic backgrounds. The tissue
specificity of genetic variability for mutant hINS-induced disease thus has its
own distinct signature. The genetic dominance of disease-specific phenotypic
variability makes this approach amenable to genome-wide association study

study of SN2009ip during its remarkable re-brightening(s). High-cadence
photometric and spectroscopic observations from the GeV to the radio band
obtained from a variety of ground-based and space facilities (including the
VLA, Swift, Fermi, HST and XMM) constrain SN2009ip to be a low energy (E~ 10^50
erg for an ejecta mass ~ 0.5 Msun) and likely asymmetric explosion in a complex
medium shaped by multiple eruptions of the restless progenitor star. Most of
the energy is radiated as a result of the shock breaking out through a dense
shell of material located at 5x10^14 cm with M~0.1 Msun, ejected by the
precursor outburst ~40 days before the major explosion. We interpret the NIR
excess of emission as signature of dust vaporization of material located
further out (R>4x 10^15 cm), the origin of which has to be connected with
documented mass loss episodes in the previous years. Our modeling predicts
bright neutrino emission associated with the shock break-out if the cosmic ray
energy is comparable to the radiated energy. We connect this phenomenology with
the explosive ejection of the outer layers of the massive progenitor star, that
later interacted with material deposited in the surroundings by previous
eruptions. Future observations will reveal if the luminous blue variable (LBV)
progenitor star survived. Irrespective of whether the explosion was terminal,
SN2009ip brought to light the existence of new channels for sustained episodic
mass-loss, the physical origin of which has yet to be identified.

extragalactic astronomy, since they are expected to make a major contribution
to the high energy peak of the X-ray background (XRB) and might constitute a
particularly active and dusty phase of black hole and galaxy evolution. Using a
newly developed SED fitting technique to decompose the AGN from the

conic optimization problems with general non-polyhedral convex cones because
the conic inequalities introduce an additional nonlinear coupling between the
variables. However in many applications the convex cones have a partially
separable structure that allows them to be characterized in terms of simpler
lower-dimensional cones. The most important example is sparse semidefinite
programming with a chordal sparsity pattern. Here partial separability derives
from the clique decomposition theorems that characterize positive semidefinite
and positive-semidefinite-completable matrices with chordal sparsity patterns.
The paper describes a decomposition method that exploits partial separability
in conic linear optimization. The method is based on Spingarn's method for
equality constrained convex optimization, combined with a fast interior-point
method for evaluating proximal operators.

rediscovering those previously identified, we employ a novel mode searching

subtracting an approximate Gaussian mixture density (based on previously

ion [Norval Fortson, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{70}, 17 (1993)]. Knowledge of M1
is crucial for any parity nonconservation measurement in Ba$^{+}$, as laser
coupling through M1 can mimic the parity-violating signal. The magnetic moment

algebras, which we believe are of some intrinsic interest. In particular, we
can quite explicitly describe the representations of the Hecke algebra that are
hit by projectives under the $\mathsf{KZ}$-functor from the Cherednik category
$\mathcal{O}$ in this case, with an explicit basis.
  This algebra has a number of beautiful structures including categorifications
of many aspects of Fock space. It can be understood quite explicitly using a
homogeneous cellular basis which generalizes such a basis given by Hu and
Mathas for cyclotomic KLR algebras. Thus, we can transfer results proven in
this diagrammatic formalism to category $\mathcal{O}$ for a cyclotomic rational
Cherednik algebra, including the connection of decomposition numbers to
canonical bases mentioned above, and an action of the affine braid group by
derived equivalences between different blocks.

computers, incorporate a variety of specialized hardware and software
mechanisms, which speed computation, but result in complex memory behavior. As
a consequence, the possible outcomes of a concurrent program can be unexpected.
A memory consistency model is a description of the behaviour of such a system.
Abstract memory consistency models aim to capture the concrete implementations
and architectures. Therefore, formal specification of the implementation or
architecture is necessary, and proofs of correspondence between the abstract
and the concrete models are required.
  This paper provides a case study of this process. We specify a new model,
partition consistency, that generalizes many existing consistency models. A
concrete message-passing network model is also specified. Implementations of
partition consistency on this network model are then presented and proved
correct. A middle level of abstraction is utilized to facilitate the proofs.
All three levels of abstraction are specified using the same framework. The
paper aims to illustrate a general methodology and techniques for specifying
memory consistency models and proving the correctness of their implementations.

in presence of small deviations from equilibrium, a situation which does not
occur in strongly oscillating bridges. Then we discuss a couple of recent
models whose solutions exhibit self-excited oscillations, the phenomenon
visible in real bridges. This suggests a different point of view in modeling

obtain a reliable theory. The purpose of this paper is precisely to highlight

hydrodynamic code is capable of mimicking evolution of the physical properties
during the formation of a proto-star. We couple our reasonably large gas-grain

the constant temperature throughout the simulation as well as by using the
temperature variation obtained from the hydrodynamical model. By considering a
large gas-grain network with the sophisticated hydrodynamic model more
realistic abundances are predicted. We find that the chemical composition are
highly sensitive to the dynamic behavior of the collapsing cloud, specifically

with a permutation invariant fitness landscape - is investigated. Using the
fact that the mutation matrix in the case of a permutation invariant fitness
landscape has a special tridiagonal form, a change of the basis is suggested
such that in the new coordinates a number of analytical results can be
obtained. In particular, using the eigenvectors of the mutation matrix as the
new basis, we show that the quasispecies distribution approaches a binomial one
and give simple estimates for the speed of convergence. Another consequence of
the suggested approach is a parametric solution to the system of equations
determining the quasispecies. Using this parametric solution we show that our
approach leads to exact asymptotic results in some cases, which are not covered
by the existing methods. In particular, we are able to present not only the
limit behavior of the leading eigenvalue (mean population fitness), but also
the exact formulas for the limit quasispecies eigenvector for special cases.
For instance, this eigenvector has a geometric distribution in the case of the
classical single peaked fitness landscape. On the biological side, we propose a
mathematical definition, based on the closeness of the quasispecies to the
binomial distribution, which can be used as an operational definition of the
notorious error threshold. Using this definition, we suggest two approximate
formulas to estimate the critical mutation rate after which the quasispecies
delocalization occurs.

global structure of clustering in real networks with that in maximally random
and in maximally ordered clustered graphs. The former are produced with an
exponential random graph model that maintains correlations among adjacent edges
at the minimum needed to conform with the expected clustering spectrum; the
later with a random model that arranges triangles in cliques inducing highly
ordered structures. To compare the global organization of clustering in real

at least in $m$ triangles. This property defines a set of nested subgraphs

crucial in the context of linear regression, especially in high dimensional
contexts. First, we demonstrate that the benefit of least-squares refitting
strongly depends on the setting and task under consideration: least-squares
refitting can be beneficial even for settings with highly correlated design
matrices but is not advisable for all settings, and least-squares refitting can
be beneficial for estimation but performs better for prediction. Finally, we

advisable for a specific setting and task under consideration, and we conduct a

motion-- the figure eight of the planar three-body problem by Chenciner and
Montgomery in 2000, a great number of simple choreographic solutions have been
discovered numerically but very few of them have rigorous existence proofs and
none of them are stable. Most important to astronomy are stable periodic
solutions which might actually be seen in some stellar system. A question for
simple choreographic solutions on $n$-body problems naturally arises: Are there
any other stable simple choreographic solutions except the figure eight?
  In this paper, we prove the existence of infinitely many simple choreographic
solutions in the classical Newtonian 4-body problem by developing a new
variational method with structural prescribed boundary conditions (SPBC).
Surprisingly, a family of choreographic orbits of this type are all linearly
stable. Among the many stable simple choreographic orbits, the most
extraordinary one is the stable star pentagon choreographic solution. The star
pentagon is assembled out of four pieces of curves which are obtained by
minimizing the Lagrangian action functional over the SPBC.
  We also prove the existence of infinitely many double choreographic periodic
solutions, infinitely many non-choreographic periodic solutions and uncountably
many quasi-periodic solutions. Each type of periodic solutions have many stable
solutions and possibly infinitely many stable solutions.

manifold is geodesically complete, a property, which always holds for compact
Riemannian manifolds. It is known that a compact Lorentzian manifold is
geodesically complete if it is homogeneous, or has constant curvature, or
admits a time-like conformal vector field. We consider certain Lorentzian
manifolds with Abelian holonomy, which are locally modelled by the so called
pp-waves, and which, in general, do not satisfy any of the above conditions.
%the condition that their curvature sends vectors that are orthogonal to the
vector field to a multiple of the vector field. We show that compact pp-waves
are universally covered by a vector space, determine the metric on the
universal cover, and prove that they are geodesically complete. Using this, we
show that every Ricci-flat compact pp-wave is a plane wave.

used for both heavy ion interactions and cosmic ray air shower simulations.
Since the last public release in 2009, the LHC experiments have provided a
number of very interesting data sets comprising minimum bias p-p, p-Pb and
Pb-Pb interactions. We describe the changes required to the model to reproduce
in detail the new data available from LHC and the consequences in the
interpretation of these data. In particular we discuss the effect of the
collective hadronization in p-p scattering. A different parametrization of flow
has been introduced in the case of a small volume with high density of
thermalized matter (core) reached in p-p compared to large volume produced in
heavy ion collisions. Both parametrizations depend only on the geometry and the
amount of secondary particles entering in the core and not on the beam mass or
energy. The transition between the two flow regimes can be tested with p-Pb
data. EPOS LHC is able to reproduce all minimum bias

study the degeneracy of these semigroups such that the flow of mappings is
foliated, i.e. each trajectory lays in a single leaf of the foliation a.s,
hence creating a geometrical obstruction for coalescence of trajectories in
different leaves. As an application, an averaging principle is proved for a
first order perturbation transversal to the leaves. Estimates for the rate of
convergence are calculated.

framework to understand the symplectic and spectral theory of finite
dimensional integrable Hamiltonian systems. While it is difficult to know what
the best approach to such a large classification task would be, it is possible
to single out some promising directions and preliminary problems. This paper
discusses them and hints at a possible path, still loosely defined, to arrive
at a classification. It mainly relies on recent progress concerning integrable
systems with only non-hyperbolic and non-degenerate singularities.
  This work originated in an attempt to develop a theory aimed at answering
some questions in quantum spectroscopy. Even though quantum integrable systems
date back to the early days of quantum mechanics, such as the work of Bohr,
Sommerfeld and Einstein, the theory did not blossom at the time. The
development of semiclassical analysis with microlocal techniques in the last
forty years now permits a constant interplay between spectral theory and
symplectic geometry. A main goal of this paper is to emphasize the symplectic
issues that are relevant to quantum mechanical integrable systems, and to
propose a strategy to solve them.

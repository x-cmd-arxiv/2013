a hierarchical series of physical {\em subsystem-types}, underlie the delicate
correlation-based complexity of life on our planet's surface. Order-parameters
associated with these broken symmetries might in the future help us broaden our
definitions of community health. For instance we show that a model of metazoan
attention-focus, on correlation-layers that look in/out from the 3 boundaries
of skin, family & culture, predicts that behaviorally-diverse communities
require a characteristic task layer-multiplicity {\em per individual} of only
about $4 \frac14$ of the six correlation layers that comprise that community.
The model may facilitate explorations of task-layer diversity, go beyond GDP &
body count in quantifying the impact of policy-changes & disasters, and help
manage electronic idea-streams in ways that strengthen community networks.
Empirical methods for acquiring task-layer multiplicity data are in their
infancy, although experience-sampling via cell-phone button-clicks might be one
place to start.

patients' health conditions. In contrast, only minimal data are usually given
about demographic factors. Yet, some of these factors can have a notable impact
on the overall death rate, thereby changing the outcome and conclusions of the
trial. This paper focuses on two of these variables. The first is marital
status; this effect, which will be referred to as the Bertillon effect, may
change death rates by over 100%. The second is the age of the oldest patients;
because of the exponential nature of Gompertz's law, changes in the
distribution of ages in the oldest age group can have dramatic consequences on
the overall number of deaths. It will be seen that randomization alone can
hardly take care of these problems. Appropriate remedies are easy to formulate
however. First, the marital status of patients as well as the age distribution
of those over 65 should be documented for both study groups. Then, thanks to
these data and based on the Bertillon and Gompertz laws, it will become
possible to perform appropriate corrections. Such corrections will notably
improve the reliability and accuracy of the trial's conclusions, especially for
trials which include a large proportion of elderly subjects.

of stationary random processes. In particular, we are interested in
mathematical constraints that can be imposed on the functional form of the
Fourier power-spectrum density (PSD) that exhibits a multiply broken shape and
several local maxima. We develop a methodology for determining the regions of
the model parameter space that can in principle reproduce a PSD shape with a
given number and position of local peaks and breaks of the PSD slope. Given the
vast space of possible parameters, it is an important requirement that the
method is fast in estimating the PSD shape for a given parameter set of the
model. We generated and discuss the theoretical PSD profiles of a
shot-noise-type random process with exponentially decaying flares. Then we
determined conditions under which one, two, or more breaks or local maxima
occur in the PSD. We calculated positions of these features and determined the
changing slope of the model PSD. Furthermore, we considered the influence of
the modulation by the orbital motion for a variability pattern assumed to
result from an orbiting-spot model. We suggest that our general methodology can
be useful in for describing non-monotonic PSD profiles (such as the trend seen,
on different scales, in exemplary cases of the high-mass X-ray binary Cygnus
X-1 and the narrow-line Seyfert galaxy Ark 564). We adopt a model where these
power spectra are reproduced as a superposition of several Lorentzians with
varying amplitudes in the X-ray-band light curve. Our general approach can help
in constraining the model parameters and in determining which parts of the
parameter space are accessible under various circumstances.

and hold valuable clues concerning the mass and energy balance within these
structures. Previous observations of these flows primarily come from H-alpha
and cool EUV lines (e.g., 304A) where estimates of the size of the prominence
threads has been limited by the resolution of the available instrumentation.
Evidence of `counter-steaming' flows has previously been inferred from these
cool plasma observations but now, for the first time, these flows have been
directly imaged along fundamental filament threads within the million degree
corona (at 193A). In this work we present observations of an active region
filament observed with Hi-C that exhibits anti-parallel flows along adjacent
filament threads. Complementary data from SDO/AIA and HMI are presented. The
ultra-high spatial and temporal resolution of Hi-C allow the anti-parallel flow
velocities to be measured (70-80 km/s) and gives an indication of the
resolvable thickness of the individual strands (0.8'' +/- 0.1''). The
temperature distribution of the plasma flows was estimated to be log T(K) =
5.45 +/- 0.10 using EM loci analysis. We find that SDO/AIA cannot clearly
observe these anti-parallel flows nor measure their velocity or thread width
due to its larger pixel size. We suggest that
  anti-parallel/counter-streaming flows are likely commonplace within all
filaments and are currently not observed in EUV due to current instrument
spatial resolution.

reflection associated with a mixed-order component propagation wave vector,
viz., (q_a,2q_b,0) with q_b = q_a approx= 0.55 reciprocal lattice units, the
presence of which is incompatible with single-q ordering but is expected from
the double-q model. A (3q_a,0,0) wave vector (i.e., third-order) satellite is
also observed, again in line with the double-q model. The temperature
dependencies of these along with that of a first-order satellite are compared
with calculations based on the double-q model and reasonable qualitative
agreement is found. By examining the azimuthal dependence of first-order
satellite scattering, we show the magnetic order to be, as predicted,
elliptically polarized at base temperature and find the temperature dependence
of the ""out of a-b plane"" moment component to be in fairly good agreement with
calculation. Our results provide qualitative support for the double-q model and

off-limb and on-disc structures. We compare the synthetic Ca filter imaging
data with intensity maps of Ca spectra at different wavelengths and temperature
maps at different optical depths. We determine the intensity response function
for the wavelengths covered by the filters of different FWHM.
  The intensity emitted off the solar limb is about 5% of the intensity at disc
centre. For a 0.3 nm-wide Ca II H filter, up to about 1/3 of the off-limb
intensity comes from emission in Hepsilon. On the disc, only about 15% of the
intensity transmitted through a broad-band filter comes from the line-core
region. No traces of elongated fibrillar structures are visible in imaging data
at disc centre, opposite to the line-core images of the Ca spectra. The
response function for a 0.3 nm-wide filter peaks at about 200 km. Relative
contributions from atmospheric layers above 800 km are about 10%. The inversion
results suggest that the slightly enhanced emission around the photospheric
magnetic network in broad-band Ca imaging data is caused by a thermal canopy at
a height of about 600 km. Broad-band Ca II H imaging data do not trace upper
chromospheric structures such as spicules in observations at the solar disc

the burst, which would be difficult to be explained by synchrotron radiation
due to the limited maximum synchrotron photon energy. The lower energy
multi-wavelength afterglow data can be fitted simultaneously by the afterglow
synchrotron emission. The implication of detecting the SSC emission for the
circumburst environment is discussed.

from the failure in capturing delicate spectral features embedded in the

important assumptions is that the Darcy model assumes the drag coefficient to
be constant. However, there is irrefutable experimental evidence that
viscosities of organic liquids and carbon-dioxide depend on the pressure.
Experiments have also shown that the drag varies nonlinearly with respect to
the velocity at high flow rates. In important technological applications like
enhanced oil recovery and geological carbon-dioxide sequestration, one
encounters both high pressures and high flow rates. It should be emphasized
that flow characteristics and pressure variation under varying drag are both
quantitatively and qualitatively different from that of constant drag.
Motivated by experimental evidence, we consider the drag coefficient to depend
on both the pressure and velocity. We consider two major modifications to the
Darcy model based on the Barus formula and Forchheimer approximation. The
proposed modifications to the Darcy model result in nonlinear partial
differential equations, which are not amenable to analytical solutions. To this
end, we present mixed finite element formulations based on least-squares
formalism and variational multiscale formalism for the resulting governing
equations. The proposed modifications to the Darcy model and its associated
finite element formulations are used to solve realistic problems with relevance
to enhanced oil recovery. We also study the competition between the nonlinear
dependence of drag on the velocity and the dependence of viscosity on the
pressure. To the best of the authors' knowledge such a systematic study has not
been performed.

counterpart, classical local mutual information, obtained through a
measurement, can be expressed as the difference between the information gained
with the evidence and the negative information generated due to the
inefficiency of the measurement itself; a novel local Shannon metric, the
transfer information content, is defined as this difference, which is negative
if the measurement generates more disturbance than the evidence, i.e.,
generates a classical measurement back action. This metric is valid for both,
Classical and Quantum measurements, and it is proposed as a starting point
towards a general physical theory of information. This information-disturbance
trade-off in classical measurements is a kind of Heisenberg principle at

This universality is a critical phenomenon near the point of enhanced symmetry,
SO(1,1), in case of conformal inflation. It appears because of the exponential
stretching of the moduli space and the resulting exponential flattening of
scalar potentials upon switching from the Jordan frame to the Einstein frame in
this class of models. This result resembles stretching and flattening of
inhomogeneities during inflationary expansion. It has a simple interpretation
in terms of velocity versus rapidity near the Kahler cone in the moduli space,
similar to the light cone of special theory of relativity. This effect makes
inflation possible even in the models with very steep potentials. We describe
conformal and superconformal versions of this cosmological attractor mechanism.

are related through unknown rigid transforms. For each point we are given
(possibly noisy) measurements of its local coordinates in some of the
coordinate systems. Alternatively, for each coordinate system, we observe the
coordinates of a subset of the points. The problem of estimating the global
coordinates of the $N$ points (up to a rigid transform) from such measurements
comes up in distributed approaches to molecular conformation and sensor network
localization, and also in computer vision and graphics.
  The least-squares formulation of this problem, though non-convex, has a well
known closed-form solution when $M=2$ (based on the singular value
decomposition). However, no closed form solution is known for $M\geq 3$.
  In this paper, we demonstrate how the least-squares formulation can be
relaxed into a convex program, namely a semidefinite program (SDP). By setting
up connections between the uniqueness of this SDP and results from rigidity
theory, we prove conditions for exact and stable recovery for the SDP
relaxation. In particular, we prove that the SDP relaxation can guarantee
recovery under more adversarial conditions compared to earlier proposed
spectral relaxations, and derive error bounds for the registration error
incurred by the SDP relaxation.
  We also present results of numerical experiments on simulated data to confirm
the theoretical findings. We empirically demonstrate that (a) unlike the
spectral relaxation, the relaxation gap is mostly zero for the semidefinite
program (i.e., we are able to solve the original non-convex least-squares
problem) up to a certain noise threshold, and (b) the semidefinite program
performs significantly better than spectral and manifold-optimization methods,

rest-frame 4-7um continuum emission in the z=4.055 submillimeter galaxy GN20,
using the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) on board the Spitzer Space Telescope.
This represents the first detection of PAH emission at z>4. The strength of the
PAH emission feature is consistent with a very high star formation rate of
~1600Msun/yr. We find that this intense starburst powers at least ~1/3 of the
faint underlying 6um continuum emission, with an additional, significant (and
perhaps dominant) contribution due to a power-law-like hot dust source, which
we interpret to likely be a faint, dust-obscured active galactic nucleus (AGN).
The inferred 6um AGN continuum luminosity is consistent with a sensitive upper
limit on the hard X-ray emission as measured by the Chandra X-Ray Observatory
if the previously undetected AGN is Compton-thick. This is in agreement with
the finding at optical/infrared wavelengths that the galaxy and its nucleus are
heavily dust-obscured. Despite the strong power-law component enhancing the
mid-infrared continuum emission, the intense starburst associated with the
photon-dominated regions that give rise to the PAH emission appears to dominate
the total energy output in the infrared. GN20 is one of the most luminous
starburst galaxies known at any redshift, embedded in a rich protocluster of
star-forming galaxies. This investigation provides an improved understanding of
the energy sources that power such exceptional systems, which represent the
extreme end of massive galaxy formation at early cosmic times.

requirements on star/galaxy separation, for measurement of the cosmological

completeness and purity provided by a given star/galaxy classifier. In order to
achieve these requirements at faint magnitudes, we propose a new method for
star/galaxy separation in the second part of the paper. We first use Principal
Component Analysis to outline the correlations between the objects parameters
and extract from it the most relevant information. We then use the reduced set
of parameters as input to an Artificial Neural Network. This multi-parameter
approach improves upon purely morphometric classifiers (such as the classifier
implemented in SExtractor), especially at faint magnitudes: it increases the
purity by up to 20% for stars and by up to 12% for galaxies, at i-magnitude

multi-component velocity structures with different velocity dispersions and/or

emission-line gas are mostly well aligned with the radio axis, suggesting a
direct causal link between the outflowing gas and the radio jets. The complex
velocity structure may be a result of different driving mechanisms related to
the onset of the radio jets. We also present the results from the line-ratio
diagnostics we used to analyze the ionization mechanism of the extended gas,
which supports the scenario where the emission-line regions are ionized by a
combination of AGN radiation and shock excitation.

low metallicity stars in the Milky Way stellar halo and those in the dwarf

environment for pre-galactic star formation might have played in shaping these
stellar populations. In particular, we consider whether differences in
cross-pollution between the progenitors of the stellar halo and the satellites
could help to explain the differences in abundance patterns. Using an N-body
simulation, we find that the progenitor halos of the main halo are primarily
clustered together at z=10 while the progenitors of the satellite galaxies
remain on the outskirts of this cluster. Next, analytically modeled
supernova-driven winds show that main halo progenitors cross-pollute each other
more effectively while satellite galaxy progenitors remain more isolated. Thus,
inhomogeneous cross-pollution as a result of different high-z spatial locations
of each system's progenitors can help to explain observed differences in
abundance patterns today. Conversely, these differences are a signature of the
inhomogeneity of metal enrichment at early times.

focusing on the halo properties of its cluster members. The cluster appears
relaxed in its X-ray emission, but has significant amounts of intracluster
light which is not centrally concentrated, suggesting that galaxy-scale
interactions are still ongoing despite the overall relaxed state. The cluster
lenses 12 background galaxies into multiple images and one galaxy at $z=1.033$
into a giant arc and its counterimage. The multiple image positions and the
surface brightness distribution (SFB) of the arc which is bent around several
cluster members are sensitive to the cluster galaxy halo properties. We model
the cluster mass distribution with a NFW profile and the galaxy halos with two
parameters for the mass normalization and extent of a reference halo assuming
scalings with their observed NIR--light. We match the multiple image positions
at an r.m.s. level of $0.85\arcsec$ and can reconstruct the SFB distribution of
the arc in several filters to a remarkable accuracy based on this cluster
model. The length scale where the enclosed galaxy halo mass is best constrained
is about 5 effective radii -- a scale in between those accessible to dynamical
and field strong lensing mass estimates on one hand and galaxy--galaxy weak
lensing results on the other hand. The velocity dispersion and halo size of a
galaxy with $m_{\rm 160W,AB}=19.2$ or $M_{\rm B,Vega}=-20.7$ are $\sigma=150

cluster galaxies are tidally stripped. We also reconstruct the unlensed source
(which is smaller by a factor of $\sim5.8$ in area), demonstrating the increase
of morphological information due to lensing and conclude that this galaxy has

perturbations may have significant effects on the gas disk structure, on
planetesimal velocity dispersion, and on the coupling between turbulence and
planetesimals. Here, we note that the impact of all of these effects on planet
formation is qualitatively altered if the circumbinary disk structure is
layered, with a non-turbulent midplane layer (dead zone) and strongly turbulent
surface layers. For close binaries, we find that the dead zone typically
extends from a radius close to the inner disk edge up to a radius of around
10-20 au from the centre of mass of the binary. The peak in the surface density
occurs within the dead zone, far from the inner disk edge, close to the snow
line, and may act as a trap for aerodynamically coupled solids. We suggest that
circumbinary planet formation may be easier near this preferential location
than for disks around single stars. However, dead zones around wide binaries
are less likely and hence planet formation may be more difficult there.

using the dual AdS_4 space we modify the boundary conditions on the spin s
field in the bulk; this approach produces \delta F in agreement with the field
theory calculations. If the spin s operator is a conserved current, then the
fixed point is described by an induced parity invariant conformal spin s gauge
theory. The low spin examples are QED_3 (s=1) and the 3-d induced conformal
gravity (s=2). When the original CFT is that of N conformal complex scalar or
fermion fields, the U(N) singlet sector of the induced 3-d gauge theory is dual
to Vasiliev's theory in AdS_4 with alternate boundary conditions on the spin s
massless gauge field. We test this correspondence by calculating the leading
term in \delta F for large N. We show that the coefficient of (1/2)\log N in
\delta F is equal to the number of spin s-1 gauge parameters that act trivially
on the spin s gauge field. We discuss generalizations of these results to 3-d
gauge theories including Chern-Simons terms and to theories where s is
half-integer. We also argue that the Weyl anomaly a-coefficients of conformal
spin s theories in even dimensions d, such as that of the Weyl-squared gravity
in d=4, can be efficiently calculated using massless spin s fields in AdS_{d+1}
with alternate boundary conditions. Using this method we derive a simple
formula for the Weyl anomaly a-coefficients of the d=4 Fradkin-Tseytlin
conformal higher-spin gauge fields. Similarly, using alternate boundary
conditions in AdS_3 we reproduce the well-known central charge c=-26 of the bc
ghosts in 2-d gravity, as well as its higher-spin generalizations.

contains a dead zone (a region of zero or low turbulence). The snow line is
within a self-gravitating part of the dead zone, and we obtain a fully analytic
solution for its radius. Our formula could prove useful for future
observational attempts to characterise the demographics of planets outside the
snow line. External sources such as comic rays or X-rays from the central star
can ionise the disc surface layers and allow the magneto-rotational instability
to drive turbulence there. We show that provided that the surface density in
this layer is less than about 50 g/cm^2, the dead zone solution exists, after
an initial outbursting phase, until the disc is dispersed by photoevaporation.
We demonstrate that the snow line radius is significantly larger than that
predicted by a fully turbulent disc model, and that in our own solar system it
remains outside of the orbital radius of the Earth. Thus, the inclusion of a
dead zone into a protoplanetary disc model explains how our Earth formed with

absorptive peaks moves differently between the topological insulator and band
insulator regimes. This may be used to verify experimentally the existence of
the two insulating phases as well as provide a measure of the spin-orbit band
gap. The zeroth Landau level splits between four spin and valley distinct
energies resulting in valley-spin-polarized levels in the density of states.
With charge doping, transitions between these levels allow for a spin- and
valley-polarized response in the conductivity whereby charge carriers of
specific spin and valley index can be isolated by tuning the incident photon
frequency. Increasing the chemical potential is shown to redistribute spectral
weight from interband transitions to a strong low-energy intraband response.
For large chemical potential, this intraband feature is associated with the
semiclassical cyclotron resonance frequency which is shown to linearly increase
with magnetic field.

  architecture of complex traits",,,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Population genetic studies have found evidence for dramatic population growth
in recent human history. It is unclear how this recent population growth,
combined with the effects of negative natural selection, has affected patterns
of deleterious variation, as well as the number, frequencies, and effect sizes
of mutations that contribute risk to complex traits. Here I use simulations
under population genetic models where a proportion of the heritability of the
trait is accounted for by mutations in a subset of the exome. I show that
recent population growth increases the proportion of nonsynonymous variants
segregating in the population, but does not affect the genetic load relative to
that in a population that did not expand. Under a model where a mutation's
effect on a trait is correlated with its effect on fitness, rare variants
explain a greater portion of the additive genetic variance of the trait in a
population that has recently expanded than in a population that did not
recently expand. Further, when using a single-marker test, for a given
false-positive rate and sample size, recent population growth decreases the
expected number of significant association with the trait relative to the
number detected in a population that did not expand. However, in a model where
there is no correlation between a mutation's effect on fitness and the effect
on the trait, common variants account for much of the additive genetic
variance, regardless of demography. Moreover, here demography does not affect
the number of significant association detected. These finding suggest recent
population history may be an important factor influencing the power of
association tests in accounting for the missing heritability of certain complex
traits.

lesions affect multiple network properties simultaneously and how changes on
smaller scales influence those on larger scales. In an EEG-based experiment on
the performance of hand motor imagery (MI) in 20 patients with unilateral
stroke, we observed that the anatomic lesion affects the functional brain
network on multiple levels. In the beta (13-30 Hz) frequency band, the MI of
the affected hand (Ahand) elicited a significantly lower smallworldness and
local efficiency (Eloc) versus the unaffected hand (Uhand). Notably, the
abnormal reduction in Eloc significantly depended on the increase in
interhemispheric connectivity, which was in turn determined primarily by the
rise in regional connectivity in the parieto-occipital sites of the affected
hemisphere. Further, in contrast to the Uhand MI, in which significantly high
connectivity was observed for the contralateral sensorimotor regions of the
unaffected hemisphere, the regions that increased in connection during the
Ahand MI lay in the frontal and parietal regions of the contralaterally
affected hemisphere. Finally, the overall sensorimotor function of our
patients, as measured by Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) index, was significantly
predicted by the connectivity of their affected hemisphere. These results
increase our understanding of stroke-induced alterations in functional brain
networks.

these limitations, we find that best models are consistent with a product of
common envelope ejection efficiency and central donor concentration ~=0.1, and
a 50% uniform -- 50% ""twins"" initial mass-ratio distribution. We present and
discuss constituent subpopulations of tXLFs according to donor, accretor and

electronic properties by strain and band-gap engineering. Germanium's potential
to extend Si functionalities, as exemplified by lasing action of strained-Ge on
Si substrates, has brought the material back to attention. Yet despite these
advances, non-radiative transitions, induced by crystal defects originating
from the Ge/Si interface, continue to be a serious bottleneck. Here we
demonstrate the drastic emission enhancement achieved via control and
mitigation over the parasitic activity of defects in micronscale Ge/Si
crystals. We unravel how defects affect interband luminescence and minimize
their influence by controlling carrier diffusion with band-gap-engineered
reflectors. We finally extended this approach designing efficient quantum well
emitters. Our results pave the way for the large-scale implementation of
advanced electronic and photonic structures unaffected by the ubiquitous
presence of defects developed at epitaxial interfaces.

the candidate protoplanet, TMR-1C, located at a separation of about 10"" (~1000
AU) from the Class I protobinary TMR-1AB in the Taurus molecular cloud. Our
campaign was conducted between October, 2011, and January, 2012. We were able
to obtain 44 epochs of observations in each of the H and Ks filters. Based on
the final accuracy of our observations, we do not find any strong evidence of
short-term NIR variability at amplitudes of >0.15-0.2 mag for TMR-1C or
TMR-1AB. Our present observations, however, have reconfirmed the
large-amplitude long-term variations in the NIR emission for TMR-1C, which were
earlier observed between 1998 and 2002, and have also shown that no particular
correlation exists between the brightness and the color changes. TMR-1C became
brighter in the H-band by ~1.8 mag between 1998 and 2002, and then fainter
again by ~0.7 mag between 2002 and 2011. In contrast, it has persistently
become brighter in the Ks-band in the period between 1998 and 2011. The (H-Ks)
color for TMR-1C shows large variations, from a red value of 1.3+/-0.07 and
1.6+/-0.05 mag in 1998 and 2000, to a much bluer color of -0.1+/-0.5 mag in
2002, and then again a red color of 1.1+/-0.08 mag in 2011. The observed
variability from 1998 to 2011 suggests that TMR-1C becomes fainter when it gets
redder, as expected from variable extinction, while the brightening observed in
the Ks-band could be due to physical variations in its inner disk structure.
The NIR colors for TMR-1C obtained using the high precision photometry from
1998, 2000, and 2011 observations are similar to the protostars in Taurus,
suggesting that it could be a faint dusty Class I source. Our study has also
revealed two new variable sources in the vicinity of TMR-1AB, which show
long-term variations of ~1-2 mag in the NIR colors between 2002 and 2011.

assign a very small (albeit perceptible) bulk viscosity to dark matter is in
agreement with available cosmological observations. Hence, we work with the
concept of viscous Cold Dark Matter ({\rm v}CDM). At the level of the
perturbations, the growth of {\rm v}CDM structures is slightly suppressed when
compared with the standard CDM ones. Having in mind that the small scale
problems of the $\Lambda$CDM model are related to an excess of clustering, our
proposal seems to indicate a possible direction for solving the serious
drawbacks of the CDM paradigm within the standard cosmological model.

terms of correlations in the spike activity of different neurons. Open
questions surround the basic nature of these correlations. In particular, what
leads to higher-order correlations -- correlations in the population activity
that extend beyond those expected from cell pairs? Here, we examine this
question for a simple, but ubiquitous, circuit feature: common fluctuating
input arriving to spiking neurons of integrate-and-fire type. We show that
leads to strong higher-order correlations, as for earlier work with discrete
threshold crossing models. Moreover, we find that the same is true for another
widely used, doubly-stochastic model of neural spiking, the linear-nonlinear
cascade. We explain the surprisingly strong connection between the collective
dynamics produced by these models, and conclude that higher-order correlations
are both broadly expected and possible to capture with surprising accuracy by
simplified (and tractable) descriptions of neural spiking.

s$^{-1}$) dissociative J shocks in which the heat of H$_2$ re-formation
maintains a large column of $\sim 300-400$ K gas; at these temperatures the
chemistry drives a considerable fraction of the oxygen not in CO to form
H$_2$O. The H$_2$O column densities, the hydrogen densities, and the warm
temperatures produced by these shocks are sufficiently high to enable powerful
maser action. The observed brightness temperatures (generally $\sim 10^{11} -
10^{14}$ K) are the result of coherent velocity regions that have dimensions in
the shock plane that are 10 to 100 times the shock thickness of $\sim 10^{13}$
cm. The masers are therefore beamed towards the observer, who typically views
the shock ""edge-on"", or perpendicular to the shock velocity; the brightest
masers are then observed with the lowest line of sight velocities with respect
to the ambient gas. We present numerical and analytic studies of the dependence
of the maser inversion, the resultant brightness temperature, the maser spot
size and shape, the isotropic luminosity, and the maser region magnetic field

human-interactive agents. The method is based on a key sociological insight
that has been developed and extensively verified over the last twenty years,
but has yet to make an impact in artificial intelligence. The insight is that
resource bounded humans will, by default, act to maintain affective
consistency. Humans have culturally shared fundamental affective sentiments
about identities, behaviours, and objects, and they act so that the transient
affective sentiments created during interactions confirm the fundamental
sentiments. Humans seek and create situations that confirm or are consistent
with, and avoid and supress situations that disconfirm or are inconsistent
with, their culturally shared affective sentiments. This ""affect control
principle"" has been shown to be a powerful predictor of human behaviour. In
this paper, we present a probabilistic and decision-theoretic generalisation of
this principle, and we demonstrate how it can be leveraged to build affectively
intelligent artificial agents. The new model, called BayesAct, can maintain
multiple hypotheses about sentiments simultaneously as a probability
distribution, and can make use of an explicit utility function to make
value-directed action choices. This allows the model to generate affectively
intelligent interactions with people by learning about their identity,
predicting their behaviours using the affect control principle, and taking
actions that are simultaneously goal-directed and affect-sensitive. We
demonstrate this generalisation with a set of simulations. We then show how our
model can be used as an emotional ""plug-in"" for artificially intelligent
systems that interact with humans in two different settings: an exam practice
assistant (tutor) and an assistive device for persons with a cognitive
disability.

(FQHE) at the even-denominator Landau level filling factor $\nu$ = 1/2 in very
high quality wide GaAs quantum wells, and at very high magnetic fields up to 45
T. The quasi-two-dimensional electron systems we study are confined to GaAs
quantum wells with widths $W$ ranging from 41 to 96 nm and have variable
densities in the range of $\simeq 4 \times 10^{11}$ to $\simeq 4 \times
10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$. We present several experimental phase diagrams for the
stability of the $\nu=1/2$ FQHE in these quantum wells. In general, for a given
$W$, the 1/2 FQHE is stable in a limited range of intermediate densities where
it has a bilayer-like charge distribution; it makes a transition to a
compressible phase at low densities and to an insulating phase at high
densities. The densities at which the $\nu=1/2$ FQHE is stable are larger for
narrower quantum wells. Moreover, even a slight charge distribution asymmetry
destabilizes the $\nu=1/2$ FQHE and turns the electron system into a
compressible state. We also present a plot of the symmetric-to-antisymmetric
subband separation ($\Delta_{SAS}$), which characterizes the inter-layer
tunneling, vs density for various $W$. This plot reveals that $\Delta_{SAS}$ at
the boundary between the compressible and FQHE phases increases
\textit{linearly} with density for all the samples. Finally, we summarize the
experimental data in a diagram that takes into account the relative strengths
of the inter-layer and intra-layer Coulomb interactions and $\Delta_{SAS}$. We
conclude that, consistent with the conclusions of some of the previous studies,
the $\nu=1/2$ FQHE observed in wide GaAs quantum wells with symmetric charge
distribution is stabilized by a delicate balance between the inter-layer and
intra-layer interactions, and is very likely described by a two-component
($\Psi_{311}$) state.

medium, resulting in interference between different transmissions. All wireless
links are modeled by independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random
variables, indicating that the dominant channel effect is the random fading
phenomenon. We characterize the throughput of one-hop communication in such

heuristic strategy, for a completely general channel power distribution. This
heuristic strategy is based on activating the source-destination pairs with the
best direct links, and forcing the others to be silent. Then, we present the
results for several common examples, namely, Gamma (Nakagami-$m$ fading),
Weibull, Pareto, and Log-normal channel power distributions. Finally -- by
proposing an upper bound on throughput of all possible strategies for
super-exponential distributions -- we prove that the aforementioned heuristic
method is order-optimal for Nakagami-$m$ fading.

Essentially RF circuits suffer from a lot of drawbacks such as limited

problems associated with RF control, few papers have been written, describing
methods which make use of the GSM network and the DTMF function of a cell phone

technology of the GSM network and the DTMF based mobile phone but it
essentially shows the construction of a circuit using only 4 bits of wireless

the detailed effects of temperature on the progress of early development have
been poorly characterized. To determine the impact of temperature on the order
and timing of events during Drosophila melanogaster embryogenesis, we used
time-lapse imaging to track the progress of embryos from shortly after egg
laying through hatching at seven precisely maintained temperatures between
17.5C and 32.5C. We employed a combination of automated and manual annotation
to determine when 36 milestones occurred in each embryo. D. melanogaster
embryogenesis takes ~33 hours at 17.5C, and accelerates with increasing
temperature to 16 hours at 27.5C, above which embryogenesis slows slightly.
Remarkably, while the total time of embryogenesis varies over two fold, the
relative timing of events from cellularization through hatching is constant
across temperatures. To further explore the relationship between temperature
and embryogenesis, we expanded our analysis to cover ten additional Drosophila
species of varying climatic origins. Six of these species, like D.
melanogaster, are of tropical origin, and embryogenesis time at different
temperatures was similar for them all. D. mojavensis, a sub-tropical fly,
develops slower than the tropical species at lower temperatures, while D.
virilis, a temperate fly, exhibits slower development at all temperatures. The
alpine sister species D. persimilis and D. pseudoobscura develop as rapidly as
tropical flies at cooler temperatures, but exhibit diminished acceleration
above 22.5C and have drastically slowed development by 30C. Despite ranging
from 13 hours for D. erecta at 30C to 46 hours for D. virilis at 17.5C, the
relative timing of events from cellularization through hatching is constant
across all species and temperatures, suggesting the existence of a timer
controlling embryogenesis.

we introduce a horizon wave-function determined by the particle wave-function
in position space, which eventually yields the probability that the particle is
a black hole. The existence of a minimum mass for black holes naturally
follows, albeit not in the form of a sharp value around the Planck scale, but
rather like a vanishing probability that a particle much lighter than the
Planck mass be a black hole. We also show that our construction entails an
effective Generalised Uncertainty Principle (GUP), simply obtained by adding
the uncertainties coming from the two wave-functions associated to a particle.
Finally, the decay of microscopic (quantum) black holes is also described in
agreement with what the GUP predicts.

means to take advantage of the proximity of devices and allow for reusing
cellular resources and thereby to increase the user bitrates and the system
capacity. However, when D2D (in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project also
called Long Term Evolution (LTE) Direct) communication in cellular spectrum is
supported, there is a need to revisit and modify the existing radio resource
management (RRM) and power control (PC) techniques to realize the potential of
the proximity and reuse gains and to limit the interference at the cellular
layer. In this paper, we examine the performance of the flexible LTE PC tool
box and benchmark it against a utility optimal iterative scheme. We find that
the open loop PC scheme of LTE performs well for cellular users both in terms
of the used transmit power levels and the achieved
signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR) distribution. However, the
performance of the D2D users as well as the overall system throughput can be
boosted by the utility optimal scheme, because the utility maximizing scheme
takes better advantage of both the proximity and the reuse gains. Therefore, in
this paper we propose a hybrid PC scheme, in which cellular users employ the
open loop path compensation method of LTE, while D2D users use the utility
optimizing distributed PC scheme. In order to protect the cellular layer, the
hybrid scheme allows for limiting the interference caused by the D2D layer at
the cost of having a small impact on the performance of the D2D layer. To
ensure feasibility, we limit the number of iterations to a practically feasible
level. We make the point that the hybrid scheme is not only near optimal, but
it also allows for a distributed implementation for the D2D users, while
preserving the LTE PC scheme for the cellular users.

have demonstrated superiority over their linear counterpart for nonlinear

input data. This dramatically increases the computational burden and memory
requirement. A variety of strategies based on dictionary learning have been
proposed to overcome this severe drawback. Few, if any, of these works analyze
the problem of updating the dictionary in a time-varying environment. In this
paper, we present an analytical study of the convergence behavior of the
Gaussian least-mean-square algorithm in the case where the statistics of the
dictionary elements only partially match the statistics of the input data. This
allows us to emphasize the need for updating the dictionary in an online way,
by discarding the obsolete elements and adding appropriate ones. We introduce a
kernel least-mean-square algorithm with L1-norm regularization to automatically
perform this task. The stability in the mean of this method is analyzed, and
its performance is tested with experiments.

galaxies is a key ingredient for understanding galaxy evolution. In particular,
the presence and structure of extra-planar gas has been a focus of research.
The Hydrogen Accretion in LOcal GAlaxieS (HALOGAS) survey aims to provide a
census on the rate of cold neutral gas accretion in nearby galaxies as well as
a statistically significant set of galaxies that can be investigated for their
extra-planar gas properties.
  In order to better understand the the vertical structure of the neutral
hydrogen in the two edge-on HALOGAS galaxies NGC 5023 and UGC 2082 we construct
detailed tilted ring models. The addition of distortions resembling arcs or
spiral arms significantly improves the fit of the models to these galaxies. In
the case of UGC 2082 no vertical gradient in rotational velocity is required in
either symmetric models nor non-symmetric models to match the observations. The
best fitting model features two arcs of large vertical extent that may be due
to accretion. In the case of NGC 5023 a vertical gradient is required in
symmetric models (dV/dz =$-14.9\pm3.8$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$) and its
magnitude is significantly lowered when non-symmetric models are considered
(dV/dz =$-9.4\pm3.8$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$). Additionally it is shown that the
underlying disk of NGC 5023 can be made symmetric, in all parameters except the
warp, in non-symmetric models. In comparison to the ""classical"" modeling these
models fit the data significantly better with a limited addition of free

gyromagnetic ratios (g-factor) in a fractional coarse-grained scenario, by
adopting a Modified Riemann-Liouville (MRL) fractional calculus. We point out
the possibility of mapping the experimental values of the specie's g-factors
into a theoretical parameter which accounts for fractionality, without
computing higher-order QED calculations. We wish to understand whether the
value of (g-2) may be traced back to a fractionality of space-time.The
justification for the difference between the experimental and the theoretical
value g=2 stemming from the Dirac equation is given in the terms of the
complexity of the interactions of the charged leptons, considered as
pseudo-particles and ""dressed"" by the interactions and the medium. Stepwise, we
build up a fractional Dirac equation from the fractional Weyl equation that, on
the other hand, was formulated exclusively in terms of the helicity operator.
From the fractional angular momentum algebra, in a coarse-grained scenario, we
work out the eigenvalues of the spin operator. Based on the standard
electromagnetic current, as an analogy case, we write down a fractional
Lagrangian density, with the electromagnetic field minimally coupled to the
particular charged lepton. We then study a fractional gauge-like invariance
symmetry, formulate the covariant fractional derivative and propose the spinor
field transformation. Finally, by taking the non-relativistic regime of the
fractional Dirac equation, the fractional Pauli equation is obtained and, from
that, an explicit expression for the fractional g-factor comes out that is
compared with the experimental CODATA value. Our claim is that the different
lepton species must probe space-time by experiencing different fractionalities,
once the latter may be associated to the effective interactions of the
different families with the medium.

an information-based criterion. An analytical solution is provided in a special

measurement of CP violation in the neutrino sector. A far detector for a
neutrino factory must have good charge identification with excellent background
rejection and a large mass. An elegant solution is to construct a magnetized
iron neutrino detector (MIND) along the lines of MINOS, where iron plates
provide a toroidal magnetic field and scintillator planes provide 3D space
points. In this report, the current status of a simulation of a toroidal MIND
for a neutrino factory is discussed in light of the recent measurements of
large $\theta_{13}$. The response and performance using the 10 GeV neutrino
factory configuration are presented. It is shown that this setup has equivalent
$\delta_{CP}$ reach to a MIND with a dipole field and is sensitive to the
discovery of CP violation over 85% of the values of $\delta_{CP}$.

incompatible with local models without any nonlocal correlations. However some
tripartite entangled states, e.g., symmetric pure states, exhibit a stronger
nonlocality even incompatible with hybrid local/nonlocal models allowing
nonlocal correlations between any two parties. Here we propose a three-particle
Hardy-type test without inequality, as illustrated by a gedanken experiment,
that is failed by all non-signaling local models while is passed by all
tripartite entangled asymmetric pure states. Our result implies that every
tripartite entangled state, regardless of the dimensions of the underlying
Hilbert spaces, passes a Hardy-type test and therefore is genuine tripartite
nonlocal. Maximal success probability and a generalization to multipartite
cases of our test are also presented.

  D-class operators","Minor corrections made, 17 pages",,,,"math.FA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We generalize the concept of coarse hypercyclicity, introduced by Feldman in
\cite{Fe1}, to that of coarse topological transitivity on open cones. We show
that a bounded linear operator acting on an infinite dimensional Banach space
with a coarsely dense orbit on an open cone is hypercyclic and a coarsely
topologically transitive (mixing) operator on an open cone is topologically
transitive (mixing resp.). We also ""localize"" these concepts by introducing two
new classes of operators called coarsely $J$-class and coarsely $D$-class
operators and we establish some results that may make these classes of
operators potentially interesting for further studying. Namely, we show that if
a backward unilateral weighted shift on $l^2(\mathbb{N})$ is coarsely $J$-class
(or $D$-class) on an open cone then it is hypercyclic. Then we give an example
of a bilateral weighted shift on $l^{\infty}(\mathbb{Z})$ which is coarsely
$J$-class, hence it is coarsely $D$-class, and not $J$-class. Note that,
concerning the previous result, it is well known that the space
$l^{\infty}(\mathbb{Z})$ does not support $J$-class bilateral weighted shifts,
see \cite{CosMa2}. Finally, we show that there exists a non-separable Banach
space which supports no coarsely $D$-class operators on open cones. Some open
problems are added.

surfaces shows that polymer chains need not localize immediately after arrival.
In a system optimized to present limited adsorption sites (quartz surface to
which polyethylene glycol (PEG) is exposed in aqueous solution at pH = 8.2) we
find that some chains diffuse back into bulk solution and re-adsorb at some
distance away, sometimes multiple times before either they localize at a stable
position or else diffuse away into bulk solution. This mechanism of surface
diffusion is considerably more rapid than the classical model in which adsorbed
polymers crawl on surfaces while the entire molecule remains adsorbed. The
trajectories with jumps follow a truncated Levy distribution of step size with
limiting slope -2.5, consistent with a well-defined, rapid surface diffusion
coefficient over the times we observe.

leads to the formation of a bound proton-electron state in the classical Bohr
model of the H atom. By using special relativity, the equivalence principle and
the de Broglie wavelength equation, we find that when the three rotating
particles have the rest masses of neutrinos or antineutrinos then surprisingly
the rest mass of the rotating state has the rest mass of the stable baryons,
i.e. of the proton and the neutron. This rest mass is due almost exclusively to
the kinetic energy of the rotating neutrinos. The results are found to be
consistent with the theory of general relativity. Predictions for the
properties of these bound rotational states are compared with experimental
values.

  with applications","28 pages, 4 figures, submitted for review in Elsevier journals",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Optimization methods have been broadly applied to two classes of objects viz.
(i) modeling and description of data and (ii) the determination of the
stationary points of functions. Here, a theoretical basis is developed that
optimizes an arbitrary number of variables for classes (i) and (ii) by the
minimization of a function of a single variable. Algorithms that focus on a
reduced variable set also avoid problems associated with multiple minima and
maxima that arise because of the large numbers of parameters. The methods
described could have applications in the physical sciences where the
optimization of one physically significant variable has priority over the other
variables. For (i), we develop both an approximate but computationally more
tractable method and an exact method where the single controlling variable k of
all the other variables (P,k) passes through the local stationary point of the
least squares (LS) metric. For (ii), an exact theory is developed whereby the
optimized function of an independent variation of all parameters coincides with
that due to single parameter optimization. The implicit function theorem has to
be further qualified to arrive at this result. The topology of the surfaces of
constant value of the target or cost function are considered for all the
methods. A real world application of the above implicit methodology to rate
constant and final concentration parameter determination for first and second
order chemical reactions from published data. This work is different from and
more general than all the reduction schemes for conditional linear parameters
nor is it a subset of the Adomian decomposition method (ADM) used for
estimating solutions of differential equations, which still require boundary
conditions that do not feature in topics (i) and (ii).

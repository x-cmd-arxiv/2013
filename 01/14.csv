engaging in cooperative behaviors, thus demonstrating that evolutionary changes
can have profound implications for populations dynamics. At the same time, the
relative fitness of cooperative traits often depends upon population density,
thus leading to the potential for bidirectional coupling between population
density and the evolution of a cooperative trait. Despite the potential
importance of these eco evolutionary feedback loops, they have not yet been
demonstrated experimentally in social species and their ecological implications
are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate the presence of a strong feedback
loop between population dynamics and the evolutionary dynamics of a social
microbial gene, SUC2, in laboratory yeast populations whose cooperative growth
is mediated by the SUC2 gene. We directly visualize eco evolutionary
trajectories of hundreds of populations over fifty generations, allowing us to
characterize the phase space describing the interplay of evolution and ecology
in this system. Small populations collapse despite continual evolution towards
increased cooperative allele frequencies; large populations with a sufficient
number of cooperators spiral to a stable state of coexistence between
cooperator and cheater strategies. The presence of cheaters does not
significantly affect the equilibrium population density, but it does reduce the
resilience of the population as well as its ability to adapt to a rapidly
deteriorating environment. Our results demonstrate the potential ecological
importance of coupling between evolutionary dynamics and the population
dynamics of cooperatively growing organisms, particularly in microbes.

now well-established chaotic rescaling behavior of the spin-glass phase, each

These chaotic renormalization-group trajectories subdivide into two categories,

(on the spinglass-paramagnetic phase boundary). We thus characterize each

chaotic trajectories and fixed distributions are mechanistically and

have a finite-temperature spin-glass phase. Furthermore, the spin-glass phases

the centre of mass frame E_{c.m.} can become indefinitely large if parameters
of one of the particles are fine-tuned, so the Ba\~nados-Silk-West (BSW) effect
manifests itself. There exists coordinate transformation which brings the
metric into the form free of the horizon. This leads to some paradox since (i)
the BSW effect exists due to the horizon, (ii) E_{c.m.} is a scalar and cannot
depend on the frame. Careful comparison of near-horizon trajectories in both
frames enables us to resolve this paradox. Although globally the space-time
structure of the metrics with acceleration horizons and black holes are
completely different, locally the vicinity of the extremal black hole horizon
can be approximated by the metric of the acceleration one. The energy of one
particle from the viewpoint of the Kruskal observer (or the one obtained from
it by finite local boost) diverges although in the stationary frame energies of
both colliding particles are finite. This suggests a new explanation of the BSW
effect for black holes given from the viewpoint of an observer who crosses the
horizon. It is complementary to the previously found explanation from the point
of view of a static or stationary observer.

MLQAD is nano-structured semiconductor system that consists of a spherical core

dependence of the electron energy spectrum and its radial probability density
on nano-system radius are studied. The numeric calculations and analysis of
oscillator strength of intersubband quantum transition from the ground state
into two first allowed excited states at the varying radius, for both the
finite and infinite confining potential (CP) as well as constant shell
thickness, are performed. It is shown that, in particular, the binding energy
and the oscillator strength of the hydrogenic impurity of a MLQAD behave
differently from that of a single-layered quantum antidot (SLQAD). For a MLQAD
with finite core and shell CPs, the state energies and the oscillator strengths
of the impurity are found to be dependent on the shell thickness. At the large
core radius and very small shell thickness, our results are closer to
respective values for a SLQAD that previously reported.

analyzed as a theory of electromagnetism without the standard gauge invariance.
Our attention is first focused on a detailed variational formulation of the
theory, which leads to both a modified Lorentz force and the true energy
momentum tensor of the vector field. The theory is then applied to cosmology. A
complete gauge invariant treatment of the scalar perturbations is presented.
For appropriate gauge invariant variables describing the scalar modes of the
vector field (A-modes), it is proved that the evolution equations of these
modes do not involve the scalar modes appearing in General Relativity
(GR-modes), which are associated to the metric and the energy momentum tensor
of the cosmological fluids. However, the A-modes modify the standard gauge
invariant equations describing the GR-modes. By using the new formalism, the
evolution equations of the A-perturbations are derived and separately solved
and, then, the correction terms --due to the A-perturbations-- appearing in the
evolution equations of the GR-modes are estimated. The evolution of these
correction terms is studied for an appropriate scale. The relevance of these
terms depends on both the spectra and the values of the normalization constants
involved in extended electromagnetism. Further applications of the new
formalism will be presented elsewhere.

determine the intrinsic mode and linear mode coupling in solar microwave

longitudinal magnetic field, to produce an uncertainty of the intrinsic mode.
One example is selected to check the feasibility of the method in the 2001
September 25 event with a loop-like structure nearby the central meridian
passage observed by Nobeyama Radio Heliograph and Polarimeters. The calculated
angle in one footpoint (FP) varied around 90 degree in two time intervals of
the maximum phase, which gives a direct evidence of the emission propagating
through a quasi-transverse region where the linear mode coupling took place,
while, the angle in another FP was always smaller than 90 degrees where the
mode coupling did not happen. Moreover, the right-circular sense at 17 GHz was
always observed in both two FPs during the event, which supports that the
transition frequency should be larger than 17 GHz in the first FP together with
strong magnetic field of over 2000 Gauses in photosphere, where the weakly
coupled case should happen. Moreover, there are two possibilities of the
intrinsic mode in the two FPs due to the 180-degree ambiguity.

MS, but only an indication of two SGB populations, while the RGB clearly splits
in two from the SGB level upward, and no red HB structure. The multicolor
analysis of the CMDs confirms that the He difference between the two main

focus for years, and could provide indirect measurements of local conditions
that are not otherwise accessible. One interesting observed phenomenon is
oscillations in filaments, activated by distant flares and the large-scale
waves they produce. Characteristics of these oscillations, such as periods,
amplitudes, and lifetimes, can provide unique information about the filament.
We measure oscillation properties in flares and filaments from H-alpha
chromospheric data using a new method that provides important spatial and
frequency content of the dynamics. We apply the method to two flare events
where filaments are observed to oscillate and determine their properties. We
find strong oscillatory signal in flaring active regions in the chromosphere
over a range of frequencies. Two filaments are found to oscillate without any
detectable chromospheric wave acting as an activation mechanism. We find that
filaments oscillate with periods of tens of minutes, but variations are
significant at small spatial scales along the filamentary region. The results
suggest there is a frequency dependence of the oscillation amplitude, as well
as a spatial dependence along single filaments that is more difficult to
quantify. It also appears that the strength of the oscillations do not
necessarily depend on the strength of the trigger, although there are other
possible effects that make this conclusion preliminary. Applications of this
technique to other events and different data sets will provide important new
insights into the local energy densities and magnetic fields associated with
dynamic chromospheric structures.

constant factor in the uniform Berry--Esseen (BE) bound for sums of independent
random variables has been gradually reduced to 0.4748 in the iid case and
0.5600 in the general case; both these values were recently obtained by
Shevtsova. On the other hand, Esseen had shown that c_u cannot be less than
0.4097. Thus, the gap factor between the best known upper and lower bounds on
(the least possible value of) c_u is now rather close to 1.
  The situation is quite different for the absolute constant factor c_{nu} in
the corresponding nonuniform BE bound. Namely, the best correctly established
upper bound on c_{nu} in the iid case is about 25 times the corresponding best
known lower bound, and this gap factor is greater than 30 in the general case.
In the present paper, improvements to the prevailing method (going back to S.
Nagaev) of obtaining nonuniform BE bounds are suggested. Moreover, a new method
is presented, of a rather purely Fourier kind, based on a family of smoothing
inequalities, which work better in the tail zones. As an illustration, a quick
proof of Nagaev's nonuniform BE bound is given. Some further refinements in the
application of the method are shown as well.

the twin oscillations change from one pair of the oscillating modes
(corresponding to a specific model of HF QPOs) to some other pair due to
non-linear resonant phenomena. The RS model is used to determine range of
allowed values of spin and mass of the neutron star located at the atoll source

resonant points are determined by the energy switch effect exhibited by the
vanishing of the amplitude difference of the upper and lower oscillations. The
predicted ranges of the neutron star parameters are strongly dependent on the
twin modes applied in the RS model. We demonstrate that for some of the
oscillatory modes used in the RS model the predicted parameters of the neutron

and reconstruction in separable Hilbert spaces. It allows one to recover any
element in any finite-dimensional subspace given finitely many of its samples
with respect to an arbitrary frame. Unlike more common approaches for this
problem, such as the consistent reconstruction technique of Eldar et al, it
leads to completely stable numerical methods possessing both guaranteed
stability and accuracy.
  The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we give a complete and formal
analysis of generalized sampling, the main result of which being the derivation
of new, sharp bounds for the accuracy and stability of this approach. Such
bounds improve those given previously, and result in a necessary and sufficient
condition, the stable sampling rate, which guarantees a priori a good
reconstruction. Second, we address the topic of optimality. Under some
assumptions, we show that generalized sampling is an optimal, stable
reconstruction. Correspondingly, whenever these assumptions hold, the stable
sampling rate is a universal quantity. In the final part of the paper we
illustrate our results by applying generalized sampling to the so-called
uniform resampling problem.

motion of the neutron stars around each other drives a loop mass current, which
gives rise to gravito-magnetism. Generally, gravito-magnetism involves a

the Standard Model Higgs boson, the electroweak vacuum would be a metastable
state at 98% C.L. In this paper we argue that, during inflation, the
electroweak vacuum can actually be very short-lived, contrary to the conclusion
that follows from the flat spacetime analysis. Namely, in the case of a pure
Higgs potential the electroweak vacuum decays via the Hawking-Moss transition,
which has no flat spacetime analogue. As a result, the Higgs vacuum is
unstable, unless the rate of inflation is low enough: $H_{\rm inf}\lesssim
10^9-10^{12}$ GeV. Models of inflation with such a low rate typically predict
negligible tensor perturbations in the cosmic microwave background radiation
(CMBR). This is also true for models in which the perturbations are produced by
a curvaton field. We also find that if the effective curvature of the Higgs
potential at a local maximum (which may be induced by inflaton-Higgs
interactions) is large enough, then the decay of the electroweak vacuum is
dominated by the Coleman-de Luccia transition. The electroweak vacuum is also
short-lived in this case, due to a negative effective self-interaction
coupling. Based on our analysis of Higgs vacuum stability during inflation, we
conclude that the observation of tensor perturbations by the Planck satellite
would provide strong indirect evidence for new physics beyond the Standard
Model responsible for stabilisation of the electroweak vacuum.

system is quantified by the dependence of the size of the largest cluster on
the number of failures. Numerically, the major challenge is the identification
of this cluster and the calculation of its size. Here, we propose an efficient
algorithm to tackle this problem. We show that the algorithm scales as O(N log

to hold at the points of a dense subset. If so, this subset is automatically
residual. Sample results that can be quoted without involving any new concept

is Hadamard differentiable at the points of a dense subset of X (ii) If f is
even, then f is continuous and Gateaux differentiable at the points of a dense

also reflexive, it contains the complement of a Haar null set. Furthermore,
(ii) remains true without the evenness requirement if the definition of Gateaux
differentiability is generalized in an unusual, but ultimately natural, way.

correction codes are designed for a given network capacity and maximum number
of errors known a priori to the encoder and decoder. However, in certain
practical settings it may be necessary to operate without such a priori
knowledge. We present rateless coding schemes for two adversarial models, where
the source sends more redundancy over time, until decoding succeeds. The first
model assumes there is a secret channel between the source and the destination
that the adversaries cannot overhear. The rate of the channel is negligible
compared to the main network. In the second model, instead of a secret channel,
the source and destination share random secrets independent of the input
information. The amount of secret information required is negligible compared
to the amount of information sent. Both schemes are optimal in that decoding
succeeds with high probability when the total amount of information received by
the sink satisfies the cut set bound with respect to the amount of message and
error information. The schemes are distributed, polynomial-time and end-to-end
in that other than the source and destination nodes, other intermediate nodes
carry out classical random linear network coding.

Finite Element Method (GMsFEM) for performing multiscale simulations for
problems without scale separation over a complex input space. As in multiscale
finite element methods (MsFEMs), the main idea of the proposed approach is to
construct a small dimensional local solution space that can be used to generate
an efficient and accurate approximation to the multiscale solution with a
potentially high dimensional input parameter space. In the proposed approach,
we present a general procedure to construct the offline space that is used for
a systematic enrichment of the coarse solution space in the online stage. The
enrichment in the online stage is performed based on a spectral decomposition
of the offline space. In the online stage, for any input parameter, a
multiscale space is constructed to solve the global problem on a coarse grid.
The online space is constructed via a spectral decomposition of the offline
space and by choosing the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest
eigenvalues. The computational saving is due to the fact that the construction
of the online multiscale space for any input parameter is fast and this space
can be re-used for solving the forward problem with any forcing and boundary
condition. Compared with the other approaches where global snapshots are used,
the local approach that we present in this paper allows us to eliminate
unnecessary degrees of freedom on a coarse-grid level. We present various

effectiveness of our method.

Previous studies have shown that both height and weight are positively
associated with blood pressure. In children, however, the concurrent increases
of height and weight have made it all but impossible to discern the effect of
height from that of weight. To better understand these influences, we propose
to examine the joint effect of height and weight on blood pressure. Bivariate
thin plate spline surfaces are used to accommodate the potentially nonlinear
effects as well as the interaction between height and weight. Moreover, we
consider a joint model for paired blood pressure measures, that is, systolic
and diastolic blood pressure, to account for the underlying correlation between
the two measures within the same individual. The bivariate spline surfaces are
allowed to vary across different groups of interest. We have developed related

similar peculiar X-ray and optical characteristics, i.e. a hard-thermal X-ray

de Oliveira et al. (2007) suggest that it might be a Be star harboring an
accreting white dwarf or that the X-rays may come from an interaction between
the surface of the star and its disk. Aims. To investigate the disk around this
Be star we used the VLTI/AMBER instrument, which combines high spectral
(R=12000) and high spatial (\theta min =4 mas) resolutions. Methods. We
constrain the geometry and kinematics of its circumstellar disk from the
highest spatial resolution ever achieved on this star. Results. We obtain a
disk extension in the Br{\gamma} line of 10.2 D\ast and 7.8 D\ast in the He I
line at 2.05 \mu m assuming a Gaussian disk model. The disk is clearly
following a Keplerian rotation. We obtained an inclination angle of 55\degree,
and the star is a nearly critical rotator with Vrot /Vc =1.00$\pm$0.2. This
inclination is greater than the value found for \gamma Cas (about 42\degree,
Stee et al. 2012), and is consistent with the inference from optical Fe II
emission profiles by Smith & Balona (2006) that the inclination should be more
than the \gamma Cas value. In the near-IR continuum, the disk of HD 110432 is 3
times larger than \gamma Cas's disk. We have no direct evidence of a companion
around HD 110432, but it seems that we have a clear signature for disk
inhomogeneities as detected for {\zeta} Tau. This asymmetrical disk detection
may be interpreted within the one-armed oscillation viscous disk framework.
Another finding is that the disk size in the near-IR is similar to other Be
stars with different spectral types and thus may be independent of the stellar
parameters, as found for classical Be stars.

showing promising predictive performance of disease states when compared to
nonprobabilistic classifiers based on multiple modalities. The statistical
analysis also quantifies the relative importance of different neuroimaging

suggests that for prediction there is little benefit in acquiring multiple

assume the inner planet transits the star. A dynamical study is performed for
different masses of the three bodies, with a special attention to terrestrial
planets. We consider a maximal time-span of ~ 100 years and discuss the shape
of the inner planet TTVs curve. Using frequency analysis, we highlight the
three periods related to the evolution of the system: two periods associated
with the Laplace-resonant angle and the third one with the precession of the
pericenters. These three periods are clearly detected in the TTVs of an inner
giant planet perturbed by two terrestrial companions. Only two periods are
detected for a Jupiter-Jupiter-Earth configuration (the ones associated with
the giant interactions) or for three terrestrial planets (the Laplace periods).
However, the latter system can be constrained from the inner planet TTVs. We
finally remark that the TTVs of resonant three or two Jupiter systems mix up,
when the period of the Laplace resonant angle matches the pericenter precession
of the two-body configuration. This study highlights the importance of TTVs

technique for studying the brain. However, in many situations, such as when
data are acquired in a resting state, it is difficult to know whether the data
are truly stationary or if level shifts have occurred. To this end,
change-point detection in sequences of functional data is examined where the
functional observations are dependent and where the distributions of
change-points from multiple subjects are required. Of particular interest is
the case where the change-point is an epidemic change---a change occurs and
then the observations return to baseline at a later time. The case where the
covariance can be decomposed as a tensor product is considered with particular
attention to the power analysis for detection. This is of interest in the
application to fMRI, where the estimation of a full covariance structure for
the three-dimensional image is not computationally feasible. Using the
developed methods, a large study of resting state fMRI data is conducted to
determine whether the subjects undertaking the resting scan have
nonstationarities present in their time courses. It is found that a sizeable
proportion of the subjects studied are not stationary. The change-point
distribution for those subjects is empirically determined, as well as its
theoretical properties examined.

percolate through a networked system. Previous studies ignored the effect that
a node outside the percolating cluster may actively induce its inside
neighbours to exit the percolating cluster. Here we study this inducing effect
on the classical site percolation and K-core percolation, showing that the
inducing effect always causes a discontinuous percolation transition. We
precisely predict the percolation threshold and core size for uncorrelated
random networks with arbitrary degree distributions. For low-dimensional
lattices the percolation threshold fluctuates considerably over realizations,
yet we can still predict the core size once the percolation occurs. The core
sizes of real-world networks can also be well predicted using degree
distribution as the only input. Our work therefore provides a theoretical
framework for quantitatively understanding discontinuous breakdown phenomena in
various complex systems.

greedy search (SUGS) algorithm Wang and Dunson for fast fitting of Dirichlet
process mixture models. The SUGS algorithm provides a means for very fast
approximate Bayesian inference for mixture data which is particularly of use
when data sets are so large that many standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
algorithms cannot be applied efficiently, or take a prohibitively long time to
converge. In particular, these ideas are used to initially interrogate the
data, and to refine models such that one can potentially apply exact data
analysis later on. SUGS relies upon sequentially allocating data to clusters
and proceeding with an update of the posterior on the subsequent allocations
and parameters which assumes this allocation is correct. Our modification
softens this approach, by providing a probability distribution over
allocations, with a similar computational cost; this approach has an
interpretation as a variational Bayes procedure and hence we term it
variational SUGS (VSUGS). It is shown in simulated examples that VSUGS can
out-perform, in terms of density estimation and classification, the original
SUGS algorithm in many scenarios. In addition, we present a data analysis for
flow cytometry data, and SNP data via a three-class dirichlet process mixture
model illustrating the apparent improvement over SUGS.

result, if confirmed by the upcoming Planck data, has deep implications on the
discovery of the nature of neutrinos. In particular, the values of the
effective neutrino mass involved in neutrinoless double beta decay (bb0nu) are
severely constrained for both the direct and inverse hierarchy, making a
discovery much more likely. In this paper, we focus in xenon-based bb0nu
experiments, on the double grounds of their good performance and the
suitability of the technology to large-mass scaling. We show that the current
generation, with effective masses in the range of 100 kg and conceivable
exposures in the range of 500 kg year, could already have a sizable opportunity
to observe bb0nu events, and their combined discovery potential is quite large.
The next generation, with an exposure in the range of 10 ton year, would have a
much more enhanced sensitivity, in particular due to the very low specific
background that all the xenon technologies (liquid xenon, high-pressure xenon
and xenon dissolved in liquid scintillator) can achieve. In addition, a
high-pressure xenon gas TPC also features superb energy resolution. We show
that such detector can fully explore the range of allowed effective Majorana
masses, thus making a discovery very likely.

constituent is characterized by the moments of the distribution function:
particle four-flows, energy-momentum tensors and third-order moment tensors. By
using Eckart's decomposition and introducing $13r+1$ scalar fields -- related
with the four-velocity, temperature of the mixture, particle number densities,
diffusion fluxes, non-equilibrium pressures, heat fluxes and pressure deviator
tensors -- Grad's distribution functions are obtained. Grad's distribution
functions are used to determine the third-order tensors and their production
terms for mixtures whose constituent's rest masses are not too disparate, so
that it follows a system of $13r+1$ scalar field equations. By restricting to a
binary mixture characterized by the six fields of partial particle number
densities, four-velocity and temperature, the remainder 21 scalar equations are
used to determine the constitutive equations for the non-equilibrium pressures,
diffusion fluxes, pressure deviator tensors and heat fluxes. Hence the
Navier-Stokes and generalized Fourier and Fick laws are obtained and the
transport coefficients of bulk and shear viscosities, thermal conductivity,
diffusion, thermal-diffusion and diffusion-thermal are determined. Furthermore,
solutions of the relativistic field equations for the binary mixture are
obtained in form of forced and free waves. In the low frequency limiting case
the phase velocity and the attenuation coefficient are determined for forced
waves. In the small wavenumber limiting case it is shown that there exist four
longitudinal eigenmodes, two of them corresponding to propagating sound modes

processes such as dip-coating, generically leads to the entrapment of small air
bubbles. Here we experimentally study this process of bubble formation by
looking through the liquid using high-speed imaging. Our central finding is
that the size of the entrapped bubble crucially depends on the location where
coalescence between the drop and the moving meniscus is initiated: (i) at a
finite height above the substrate, or (ii) exactly at the contact line. In the
first case, we typically find bubble sizes of the order of a few microns,
independent of the size and speed of the impacting drop. By contrast, the
bubbles that are formed when coalescence starts at the contact line become
increasingly large, as the size or the velocity of the impacting drop is
increased. We show how these observations can be explained from a balance
between the lubrication pressure in the air layer and the capillary pressure of
the drop.

parameters for last four solar cycles from 20th to 23rd. We studied statistical
characteristics of such key heliospheric parameters as solar wind proton number
density, temperature, bulk velocity, and IMF vector as well as dimensionless
parameters. From harmonic analysis of the variations of key parameters we found
basic periods of 13.5 days, 27 days, 1 year, and ~11 years, which correspond to
rotation of the Sun, Earth and to the solar cycle. We also revealed other
periodicities such as specific five-year plasma density and temperature
variations, which origin is a subject of discussion. We have found that the
distribution of solar wind proton density, temperature and IMF is very close to
a log-normal function, while the solar wind velocity is characterized by a very
broad statistical distribution. Detailed study of the variability of
statistical distributions with solar activity was performed using a method of
running histograms. In general, the distributions of heliospheric parameters
are wider during maximum and declining phase of the solar cycle. More
complicated behavior was revealed for the solar wind velocity and temperature,
which distribution is characterized by two- or even tree-peak structure in
dependence on the phase of solar cycle. Our findings support the concepts of
solar wind sources in the open, closed and intermittent magnetic regions on the

cooperative downlink OFDMA transmission aided by a decode-and-forward (DF)
relay. Specifically, user message bits are transmitted in two consecutive
equal-duration time slots. A subcarrier in the first slot can be paired with a
subcarrier in the second slot for the DF relay-aided transmission to a user. In
particular, the source and the relay can transmit simultaneously to implement
beamforming at the subcarrier in the second slot for the relay-aided
transmission. Each unpaired subcarrier in either the first or second slot is
used by the source for direct transmission to a user without the relay's
assistance. The sum rate maximized resource allocation (RA) problem is
addressed for this protocol under a total power constraint. It is shown that
the novel protocol leads to a maximum sum rate greater than or equal to that
for a benchmark one, which does not allow the source to implement beamforming
at the subcarrier in the second slot for the relay-aided transmission. Then, a
polynomial-complexity RA algorithm is developed to find an (at least
approximately) optimum resource allocation (i.e., source/relay power,
subcarrier pairing and assignment to users) for either the proposed or
benchmark protocol. Numerical experiments illustrate that the novel protocol
can lead to a much greater sum rate than the benchmark one.

fundamental symmetries: time reversal invariance (T) and parity (P). Assuming
the CPT theorem this implies CP-violation. The CP-violation of the Standard
Model is orders of magnitude too small to be observed experimentally in EDMs in
the foreseeable future. It is also way too small to explain the asymmetry in
abundance of matter and anti-matter in our universe. Hence, other mechanisms of
CP violation outside the realm of the Standard Model are searched for and could
result in measurable EDMs.
  Up to now most of the EDM measurements were done with neutral particles. With
new techniques it is now possible to perform dedicated EDM experiments with
charged hadrons at storage rings where polarized particles are exposed to an
electric field. If an EDM exists the spin vector will experience a torque
resulting in change of the original spin direction which can be determined with
the help of a polarimeter. Although the principle of the measurement is simple,
the smallness of the expected effect makes this a challenging experiment
requiring new developments in various experimental areas.
  Complementary efforts to measure EDMs of proton, deuteron and light nuclei
are pursued at Brookhaven National Laboratory and at Forschungszentrum Juelich
with an ultimate goal to reach a sensitivity of 10^{-29} e cm.

Herschel data of the same region allow a direct comparison to the dust
component of the cloud core and provide evidence for gas phase depletion of CO
at the highest extinctions. The dust color emperature in the core calculated
from Herschel maps ranges from roughly 10.7 to 14.0 K. This range agrees with
the previous determinations from Infrared Space Observatory and Planck
observations. The column density profile of the core can be fitted with a
Plummer-like density distribution approaching n(r) ~ r^{-2} at large distances.
The core structure deviates clearly from a critical Bonnor-Ebert sphere.
Instead, the core appears to be gravitationally bound and to lack thermal and
turbulent support against the pressure of the surrounding low-density material:
it may therefore be in the process of slow contraction. We test two chemical
models and find that a steady-state depletion model agrees with the observed
C18O column density profile and the observed N(C18O) versus AV relationship.

eccentricity of 0.38. Based on systemic velocities and relative proper motions,
we show that all the three systems are members of the cluster. We find that the
distance to M4 is 1.82+-0.04 kpc - in good agreement with recent estimates
based on entirely different methods. We compare the absolute parameters of V66
and V69 with two sets of theoretical isochrones in mass-radius and
mass-luminosity diagrams, and for an assumed [Fe/H] = -1.20, [alpha/Fe] = 0.4,
and Y = 0.25 we find the most probable age of M4 to be between 11.2 and 11.3
Gyr. CMD-fitting with the same parameters yields an age close to, or slightly
in excess of, 12 Gyr. However, considering the sources of uncertainty involved
in CMD fitting, these two methods of age determination are not discrepant. Age
and distance determinations can be further improved when infrared eclipse

growth due to transverse phase mixing. 3D PIC simulations show that ultra-short
(around 8 fs) high-current (0.4 kA) electron bunches with a normalized
emittance of 8.5 and 6 nm in the two planes respectively and a brightness
greater than 1.7*10e19 A rad-2 m-2 can be obtained for realistic parameters.

the search for extrasolar planets. Current models of activity-induced radial
velocity (RV) signals focused on the impact of temperature contrast in spots
predicting the signal to diminish toward longer wavelengths. On the other hand,
the relative importance of the Zeeman effect on RV measurements should grow
with wavelength, because the Zeeman displacement itself grows with \lambda, and
because a magnetic and cool spot contributes more to the total flux at longer
wavelengths. We model the impact of active regions on stellar RV measurements
including both temperature contrast in spots and Zeeman line broadening. We
calculate stellar line profiles using polarized radiative transfer models
including atomic and molecular Zeeman splitting from 0.5 to 2.3\mum. Our
results show that the amplitude of the RV signal caused by the Zeeman effect
alone can be comparable to that caused by temperature contrast. Furthermore,
the RV signal caused by cool and magnetic spots increases with wavelength. We
also calculate the RV signal due to variations in average magnetic field
strength from one observation to the next, but find it unlikely that this can
significantly influence the search for extrasolar planets. As an example, we
derive the RV amplitude of the active M dwarf AD Leo as a function of
wavelength using data from the HARPS spectrograph. The RV signal does not
diminish at longer wavelengths but shows evidence for the opposite behavior. We
conclude that the RV signal of active stars does not vanish at longer
wavelength but sensitively depends on the combination of spot temperature and
magnetic field; in active low-mass stars, it is even likely to grow with
wavelength.

rotation powered pulsars and companion stars with strong stellar winds. It is
proposed that the stellar and pulsar winds have to mix at some distance from
the binary system, defined by the orbital period of the companion stars and the
velocity of the stellar wind. The mixed pulsar-stellar wind expands with a
specific velocity determined by the pulsar power and the mass loss rate of the
companion star. Relativistic particles, either from the inner pulsar
magnetosphere and/or accelerated at the shocks between stellar and pulsar
winds, are expected to be captured and isotropized in the reference frame of
the mixed wind. Therefore, they can efficiently comptonize stellar radiation
producing GeV-TeV $\gamma$-rays in the inverse Compton process. We calculate
the $\gamma$-ray spectra expected in such scenario for the two example binary
systems: J1816+4510 which is the redback type millisecond binary and LS 5039
which is supposed to contain energetic pulsar. It is concluded that the steady
TeV $\gamma$-ray emission from J1816+4510 should be on the 100 hr sensitivity
limit of the planned Cherenkov Telescope Array, provided that $\epsilon\sim
10%$ of the rotational energy lost by the pulsar is transferred to TeV
electrons. On the other hand, the comparison of the predicted steady TeV
$\gamma$-ray emission, expected from $\gamma$-ray binary LS 5039, with the
observations of the TeV emission in a low state, reported by the H.E.S.S.
Collaboration, allows us to put stringent upper limit on the product of the
part of the hemisphere in which the mixed pulsar-stellar wind is confined,
$\Delta_{\rm mix}$, and the energy conversion efficiency, $\epsilon$, from the
supposed pulsar to the TeV electrons injected in this system, $\Delta_{\rm

structures of networks. At first, we introduce the notions of internal
dominating set and external dominating set of a community. We show that most
communities in real networks have a small internal dominating set and a small
external dominating set, and that the internal dominating set of a community
keeps much of the information of the community. Secondly, based on the notions
of the internal dominating set and the external dominating set, we define an
internal slope (ISlope, for short) and an external slope (ESlope, for short) to
measure the internal heterogeneity and external heterogeneity of a community
respectively. We show that the internal slope (ISlope) of a community largely
determines the structure of the community, that most communities in real
networks are heterogeneous, meaning that most of the communities have a
core/periphery structure, and that both ISlopes and ESlopes (reflecting the
structure of communities) of all the communities of a network approximately
follow a normal distribution. Therefore typical values of both ISolpes and
ESoples of all the communities of a given network are in a narrow interval, and
there is only a small number of communities having ISlopes or ESlopes out of
the range of typical values of the ISlopes and ESlopes of the network. Finally,
we show that all the communities of the real networks we studied, have a three
degree separation phenomenon, that is, the average distance of communities is
approximately 3, implying a general property of true communities for many real
networks, and that good community finding algorithms find communities that
amplify clustering coefficients of the networks, for many real networks.

French), whose the main characteristics are: 1) A network connected to its
environment is considered as immersed into an information field created by this
environment which so dictates to it the learning constraints. 2) The used
formalism draws one's inspiration from the one of the Quantum field theory
(Principle of stationary action, gauge fields, invariance by symmetry
transformations,...). 3) We obtain Lagrange equations whose solutions describe
the network evolution during the whole learning period. 4) Then, while
proceeding with the same formalism inspiration, we suggest other study ways
capable of evolving the knowledge in the considered scope. In a second part,
after a reminder of the points to be improved, we exhibit the Version 5 which
brings, we think, relevant improvements. Indeed: 5) We consider the weighted
averages of the variables; this introduces probabilities. 6) We define two
observables (L average of information flux and A activity of the network) which
could be measured and so be compared with experimental results. 7) We find that
L , weighted average of information flows, is an invariant. 8) Finally, we
propose two expressions for the conactance, from which we deduce the
corresponding Lagrange equations which have to be solved to know the evolution
of the considered weighted averages. But, at the present stage, we think that
we can progress only by carrying out experiments (see projects like Human brain
project) and discovering invariants, symmetries which would allow us, like in
Physics, to classify networks and above all to understand better the
connections between them. Indeed, and that is what we propose among the future
research ways, the underlying problem is to understand how, after their
learning period, several networks can connect together to produce, in the brain

compares the relative entropy of entanglement (REE) for a given degree of the

nonlocality). By applying Monte-Carlo simulations, we find the maximally
entangled mixed states and show that they are likely to be optimal by checking
the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, which generalize the method of Lagrange

multilayer coatings are required. Interface imperfections in the multilayer
growth process are known to cause non-specular scattering and degrade the
mirror optical performance; therefore, it is important to predict the amount of
X-ray scattering from the rough topography of the outer surface of the coating,
which can be directly measured, e.g., with an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM).
This kind of characterization, combined with X-ray reflectivity measurements to
assess the deep multilayer stack structure, can be used to model the layer
roughening during the growth process via a well-known roughness evolution
model. In this work, X-ray scattering measurements are performed and compared
with simulations obtained from the modeled interfacial Power Spectral Densities
(PSDs) and the modeled Crossed Spectral Densities for all the couples of
interfaces. We already used this approach in a previous work for periodic
multilayers; we now show how this method can be extended to graded multilayers.
The upgraded code is validated for both periodic and graded multilayers, with a
good accord between experimental data and model findings. Doing this, different
kind of defects observed in AFM scans are included in the PSD analysis. The
subsequent data-model comparison enables us to recognize them as surface
contamination or interfacial defects that contribute to the X-ray scattering of
the multilayer.

stochastic models for which the likelihood function is difficult or even
impossible to calculate, and hence conventional likelihood-based inferential
echniques cannot be used. In such settings, Bayesian inference can be performed
using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). However, in spite of many recent
developments to ABC methodology, in many applications the computational cost of
ABC necessitates the choice of summary statistics and tolerances that can
potentially severely bias the estimate of the posterior.
  We propose a new ""piecewise"" ABC approach suitable for discretely observed
Markov models that involves writing the posterior density of the parameters as
a product of factors, each a function of only a subset of the data, and then
using ABC within each factor. The approach has the advantage of side-stepping
the need to choose a summary statistic and it enables a stringent tolerance to
be set, making the posterior ""less approximate"". We investigate two methods for
estimating the posterior density based on ABC samples for each of the factors:
the first is to use a Gaussian approximation for each factor, and the second is
to use a kernel density estimate. Both methods have their merits. The Gaussian
approximation is simple, fast, and probably adequate for many applications. On
the other hand, using instead a kernel density estimate has the benefit of
consistently estimating the true ABC posterior as the number of ABC samples
tends to infinity. We illustrate the piecewise ABC approach for three examples;
in each case, the approach enables ""exact matching"" between simulations and
data and offers fast and accurate inference.

initiated by the catastrophic recombination of trapped atomic hydrogen. We
propose that, in molecular clouds, the processes of freeze-out onto ice
mantles, accumulation of radicals, explosion and then rapid (three-body)
gas-phase chemistry occurs in a cyclic fashion. This can lead to a cumulative
molecular enrichment of the interstellar medium. A model of the time-dependent
chemistries, based on this hypothesis, shows that significant abundances of
large molecular species can be formed, although the complexity of the species
is limited by the short expansion timescale in the gas, immediately following
mantle explosion. We find that this mechanism may be an important source of
smaller organic species, such as methanol and formaldehyde, as well as
precursors to bio-molecule formation. Most significantly, we predict the
gas-phase presence of these larger molecular species in quiescent molecular
clouds and not just dynamically active regions, such as hot cores. As such the
mechanism that we propose complements alternative methods of large molecule
formation, such as those that invoke solid-state chemistry within activated ice
mantles.

summed into the running coupling, and one obtains a unique, scale-fixed,
scheme-independent prediction at any finite order. In the paper, we make a
detailed PMC analysis for both the polarized and the unpolarized cross sections
for the double charmonium production process, $e^{+} + e^{-} \to J/ \psi
(\psi') + \chi_{cJ}$ with $(J=0,1,2)$. The running behavior for the coupling
constant, governed by the PMC scales, are determined exactly for the specific
processes. We compare our predictions with the measurements at the $B$
factories, BABAR and Belle, and the theoretical estimations obtained in the
literature. Because the non-conformal terms are different for various polarized
and unpolarized cross sections, the PMC scales of these cross sections are
different in principle. It is found that all the PMC scales are almost
independent of the initial choice of renormalization scale. Thus, the large
renormalization scale uncertainty usually adopted in the literature up to
$sim40%$ at the NLO level, obtained from the conventional scale setting, for
both the polarized and the unpolarized cross sections are greatly suppressed.
It is found that the charmonium production is dominated by J=0 channel. After
PMC scale setting, we obtain $\sigma(J/\psi+\chi_{c0}) = 12.25^{+3.70}_{-3.13}$
fb and $\sigma(\psi'+\chi_{c0}) =5.23^{+1.56}_{-1.32}$ fb,......

trajectories crossing record sized barriers, a behavior revealing the presence
of a hierarchical structure in configuration space. The observation is here
turned into a novel local search optimization algorithm dubbed Record Dynamics
Optimization, or RDO. RDO uses the Metropolis rule to accept or reject
candidate solutions depending on the value of a parameter akin to the
temperature, and minimizes the cost function of the problem at hand through
cycles where its `temperature' is raised and subsequently decreased in order to
expediently generate record high (and low) values of the cost function. Below,
RDO is introduced and then tested by searching the ground state of the
Edwards-Anderson spin-glass model, in two and three spatial dimensions. A
popular and highly efficient optimization algorithm, Parallel Tempering (PT) is
applied to the same problem as a benchmark. RDO and PT turn out to produce
solution of similar quality for similar numerical effort, but RDO is simpler to
program and additionally yields geometrical information on the system's
configuration space which is of interest in many applications. In particular,
the effectiveness of RDO strongly indicates the presence of the above mentioned
hierarchically organized configuration space, with metastable regions indexed
by the cost (or energy) of the transition states connecting them.

to the historical set of Eurovision contests from 1975 to 2012, finding new

a measure of polarization that, when applied to empirical data, shows a sharp

that magnetic field (B) has a strong influence on both disk formation and
fragmentation; even a relatively low B can prevent these processes. However,
very few studies investigated the combined effects of B and turbulence. We
study the effects of turbulence in magnetized core collapse, focusing on the
magnetic diffusion, the orientation of the angular momentum (J) of the
protostellar core, and on its consequences on disk formation, fragmentation and
outflows. We perform 3D, AMR, MHD simulations of magnetically supercritical
collapsing dense cores of 5 Msun using the MHD code RAMSES. A turbulent
velocity field is imposed as initial conditions, characterised by a Kolmogorov
power spectrum. Different levels of turbulence and magnetization are
investigated, as well as 3 realisations for the turbulent velocity field.
Magnetic diffusion, orientation of the rotation axis with respect to B,
transport of J, disk formation, fragmentation and outflows formation are
studied. The turbulent velocity field imposed as initial conditions contains a
non-zero J, responsible for a misalignment of the rotation axis. Turbulence is
also responsible for an effective turbulent diffusivity in the vicinity of the
core. Both effects are responsible for a significant decrease of the magnetic
braking, and facilitate the formation of early massive disks for not too high
magnetization. Fragmentation can occur even with mu ~ 5 at late time in
contrast with 1 Msun cores for which fragmentation is prevented for such values
of mu. Slow asymmetric outflows are launched. They carry a mass which is
comparable to the mass within the core. Because of misalignment and turbulent
diffusion, massive disk formation is possible though their mass and size are
still reduced compared to the hydrodynamical case. We find that for mu >= 5,
fragmentation can happen.

Reconstruction of the redshifts with high resolution and well-understood

baryonic acoustic oscillations. We investigate different approaches to
establish the accuracy that can be reached by the LSST six-band photometry. We
construct a realistic mock galaxy catalog, based on the GOODS survey luminosity
function, by simulating the expected apparent magnitude distribution for the
LSST. To reconstruct the photometric redshifts (photo-z's), we consider a
template-fitting method and a neural network method. The photo-z reconstruction
from both of these techniques is tested on real CFHTLS data and also on
simulated catalogs. We describe a new method to improve photo-z reconstruction
that efficiently removes catastrophic outliers via a likelihood ratio
statistical test. This test uses the posterior probability functions of the fit
parameters and the colors. We show that the photometric redshift accuracy will
meet the stringent LSST requirements up to redshift $\sim2.5$ after a selection
that is based on the likelihood ratio test or on the apparent magnitude for
galaxies with $S/N>5$ in at least 5 bands. The former selection has the
advantage of retaining roughly 35% more galaxies for a similar photo-z
performance compared to the latter. Photo-z reconstruction using a neural
network algorithm is also described. In addition, we utilize the CFHTLS
spectro-photometric catalog to outline the possibility of combining the neural
network and template-fitting methods. We conclude that the photo-z's will be
accurately estimated with the LSST if a Bayesian prior probability and a
calibration sample are used.

in a semiconductor quantum dot after ultrafast optical excitation. An
excitation with a single ultrafast pulse creates an exciton confined to the
quantum dot, which is coupled to longitudinal acoustic phonons. This leads to
the formation of a polaron in the quantum dot accompanied by the emission of a
phonon wave packet. We show that the fluctuations of the lattice displacement
associated with the wave packet after a single laser pulse excitation in
resonance with the exciton transition are always larger than their respective
vacuum values. Manipulating the exciton with a second pulse can result in a
reduction of the fluctuations below their vacuum limit, which means that the
phonons are squeezed. We show that the squeezing properties of the wave packet
strongly depend on the relative phase and the time delay between the two laser
pulses.

models of photoevaporating discs with a giant planet embedded. We find that, by
reducing the mass accretion flow onto the star, discs that form giant planets
will be dispersed at earlier times than discs without planets by X-ray
photoevaporation. By clearing the portion of the disc inner of the planet
orbital radius, planet formation induced photoevaporation (PIPE) is able to
produce transition disc that for a given mass accretion rate have larger holes
when compared to standard X-ray photoevaporation. This constitutes a possible
route for the formation of the observed class of accreting transition discs
with large holes, which are otherwise difficult to explain by planet formation
or photoevaporation alone. Moreover, assuming that a planet is able to filter
dust completely, PIPE produces a transition disc with a large hole and may
provide a mechanism to quickly shut down accretion. This process appears to be
too slow however to explain the observed desert in the population of transition
disc with large holes and low mass accretion rates.

amplitude and shape changes of this signal are best explicable with a

that the hourly variations are due to a variable stellar wind, and are global

rigorous mathematical theory exists for random arrays that addresses
fundamental question such as how many targets can be recovered, at what
resolution, at which noise level, and with which algorithm. In a different line
of research in radar, mathematicians and engineers have invested significant

desirable properties. In this paper we bring these two seemingly unrelated
areas together. Using tools from compressive sensing we derive a theoretical
framework for the recovery of targets in the azimuth-range-Doppler domain via
random antennas arrays. In one manifestation of our theory we use Kerdock codes
as transmission waveforms and exploit some of their peculiar properties in our
analysis. Our paper provides two main contributions: (i) We derive the first
rigorous mathematical theory for the detection of moving targets using random
sensor arrays. (ii) The transmitted waveforms satisfy a variety of properties
that are very desirable and important from a practical viewpoint. Thus our
approach does not just lead to useful theoretical insights, but is also of
practical importance. Various extensions of our results are derived and

infrared galaxy IRAS 09104+4109 which is dominated by a Type 2 AGN. The
infrared to X-ray SED indicates that the source is an obscured quasar with a
Compton-thin absorber. However, the 3$\sigma$ hard X-ray detection of the
source with the \emph{BeppoSAX} PDS suggested a reflection-dominated,
Compton-thick view. The high-energy detection was later found to be possibly
contaminated by another Type 2 AGN, NGC 2785, which is only 17 arcmin away. Our
new \emph{Suzaku} observation offers simultaneous soft and hard X-ray coverage
and excludes contamination from NGC 2785. We find that the hard X-ray component
is not detected by the \emph{Suzaku} HXD/PIN (effective energy band 14-45 keV).
Both reflection and transmission models have been tested on the latest
\emph{Suzaku} and \emph{Chandra} data. The 0.5-10 keV spectrum can be well
modelled by the two scenarios. In addition, our analysis implied that the
absorption column required in both models is $N_{\rm H} \sim 5 \times 10^{23}$
cm$^{-2}$. Unless IRAS 09104+4109 is a ""changing-look"" quasar, we confirm that
it is a Compton-thin AGN. Although the lack of detection of X-ray emission
above 10 keV seems to favour the transmission scenario, we found that the two
models offer fairly similar flux predictions over the X-ray band below $\sim$
40 keV. We also found that the strong iron line shown in the \emph{Suzaku}
spectrum is in fact a blend of two emission lines, in which the 6.4 keV one is
mostly contributed from the AGN and the 6.7 keV from the hot cluster gas. This
implies that the neutral line is perhaps caused by disc reflection, and the
reflection-dominated model is more likely the explanation. The transmission
model should not be completely ruled out, but a deeper hard X-ray spectrum
observation is needed to discriminate between the two scenarios.

equation. A nonlinear dispersion of the considered motion allowed to find a
principal consequence: a chaotic system with uniform dynamic properties tends
to unstable clustering. Small fluctuations of particles density increase by
time and form attractors and stochastic islands even if the initial transport
properties have uniform distribution. It was shown that an instability of phase
trajectories leads to the nonlinear dispersion law and consequently to a space
instability. A fixed boundary system was considered, using a standard
Fokker-Planck equation. We have derived that such a type of dynamic systems has
a discrete diffusive and energy spectra. It was shown that phase space
diffusion is the only parameter that defines a dynamic accuracy in this case.

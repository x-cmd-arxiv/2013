bees cling onto each other to form a dense cluster that may be exposed to the
environment for several days. This cluster has the ability to maintain its core
temperature actively without a central controller, and raises the question of
how this is achieved. We suggest that the swarm cluster is akin to an active
porous structure whose functional requirement is to adjust to outside
conditions by varying its porosity to control its core temperature. Using a
continuum model that takes the form of a set of advection-diffusion equations
for heat transfer in a mobile porous medium, we show that the equalization of
an effective ""behavioural pressure"", which propagates information about the
ambient temperature through variations in density, leads to effective
thermoregulation. Our model extends and generalizes previous models by focusing
the question of mechanism on the form and role of the behavioural pressure, and
allows us to explain the vertical asymmetry of the cluster (as a consequence of
buoyancy driven flows), the ability of the cluster to overpack at low ambient
temperatures without breaking up at high ambient temperatures, and the relative
insensitivity to large variations in the ambient temperature. Finally, our
theory makes testable hypotheses for how the cluster bee density should respond
to externally imposed temperature inhomogeneities, and suggests strategies for
biomimetic thermoregulation.

nebulae' to be redshifted (21 out of 25 cases). From a modern perspective, it
could seem surprising that the expansion of the universe was not announced at
this point. Examination of Slipher's papers shows that he reached a more subtle
conclusion: the identification of cosmological peculiar velocities, including
the bulk motion of the Milky Way, leading to a beautiful argument in favour of
nebulae as distant stellar systems. Nevertheless, Slipher's data actually
contain evidence at >8sigma for a positive mean velocity, even after
subtracting the dipole owing to the motion of the observer. In 1929, Hubble
estimated distances for a sample of no greater depth, using redshifts due
almost entirely to Slipher. Hubble's distances were flawed in two distinct
ways: in addition to an incorrect absolute calibration, the largest distances
were systematically under-estimated. Nevertheless, he claimed the detection of
a linear distance-redshift relation. Statistically, the evidence for such a
correlation is less strong than the simple evidence for a positive mean
velocity in Hubble's sample. Comparison with modern data shows that a sample of
more than twice Hubble's depth would generally be required in order to reveal
clearly the global linear expansion in the face of the 'noise' from peculiar
velocities. When the theoretical context of the time is examined, the role of
the de Sitter model and its prediction of a linear distance-redshift relation
looms large. A number of searches for this relation were performed prior to
Hubble over the period 1924-1928, with a similar degree of success. All were
based on the velocities measured by Slipher, whose work from a Century ago
stands out both for the precision of his measurements and for the subtle
clarity of the arguments he employed to draw correct conclusions from them.

gravitation. For the first time, we will have access to the genuinely
strong-field dynamics, where low-energy imprints of quantum gravity may well
show up. In addition, we will be able to search for effects which might only
make their presence known at large distance scales, such as the ones that
gravitational waves must traverse in going from source to observer. Finally,
coalescing binaries can be used as cosmic distance markers, to study the
large-scale structure and evolution of the Universe.
  With the advanced detector era fast approaching, concrete data analysis
algorithms are being developed to look for deviations from general relativity
in signals from coalescing binaries, taking into account the noisy detector
output as well as the expectation that most sources will be near the threshold
of detectability. Similarly, several practical methods have been proposed to
use them for cosmology. We explain the state of the art, including the
obstacles that still need to be overcome in order to make optimal use of the
signals that will be detected. Although the emphasis will be on
second-generation observatories, we will also discuss some of the science that
could be done with future third-generation ground-based facilities such as
Einstein Telescope, as well as with space-based detectors.

neutrino from particle physics and cosmology, the neutrino sector of the
standard model of particle physics has to be extended and the smallest
extension is the (3+1) model, i.e. three active neutrinos plus one sterile one.
In this work we study the neutrino mass matrix $M_\nu$ with three texture zeros
in the (3+1) model, assuming all the neutrino states are of Majorana type. With
the mass hierarchy between the active and sterile neutrinos as well as the
smallness of the reactor neutrino mixing and active-sterile mixing, the
analytical expressions can be greatly simplified. We systematically examine all
the 120 texture zeros, via both analytical and numerical analysis, and find
that the 100 textures with zeros in the fourth column and row of $M_\nu$ can
hardly be compatible with experiments whereas 19 of the other 20 are feasible.
We can foresee that the active neutrino masses are required to be around 0.01
eV and the next generation neutrinoless double beta decay experiments are
promising to test these textures. Many other phenomenologically meaningful
predictions are also obtained. All the CP conserving (3+1) textures with three

and Seymour [4] in connection with development of a structural theory for
tournaments, or more generally, for semi-complete digraphs. In this paper we
provide an algorithm with running time 2^{O(\sqrt{k log k})} * n^{O(1)} that
tests whether the cutwidth of a given n-vertex semi-complete digraph is at most
k, improving upon the currently fastest algorithm of the second author [18]
that works in 2^{O(k)} * n^2 time. As a byproduct, we obtain a new algorithm
for Feedback Arc Set in tournaments (FAST) with running time 2^{c\sqrt{k}} *
n^{O(1)}, where c = 2\pi / \sqrt(3)*\ln(2) <= 5.24, that is simpler than the
algorithms of Feige [9] and of Karpinski and Schudy[16], both also working in
2^{O(\sqrt{k})} * n^{O(1)} time. Our techniques can be applied also to other
layout problems on semi-complete digraphs. We show that the Optimal Linear
Arrangement problem, a close relative of Feedback Arc Set, can be solved in
2^{O(k^{1/3} \sqrt{\log k})} * n^{O(1)} time, where k is the target cost of the

that LNII correlates almost linearly with LIR for non AGN galaxies (all having

a SFR tracer which is particularly useful for high redshift galaxies which will
be observed with forthcoming submm spectroscopic facilities such as the Atacama

from the mean LNII-LIR relation correlates with tracers of the ionization

variations in the hardness, and/or ionization parameter, of the ambient
galactic UV field among the sources in our sample.

emerging flux using a two dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation. We
found that slow mode shock waves generated by magnetic reconnection in the
chromosphere and the photosphere play key roles in the acceleration mechanisms
of chromospheric jets. An important parameter is the height of magnetic
reconnection. When magnetic reconnection takes place near the photosphere, the
reconnection out- flow collides with the region where the plasma beta is much
larger than unity. Then the plasma moves along a magnetic field. This motion
generates a slow mode wave. The slow mode wave develops to a strong slow shock
as it propagates upward. When the slow shock crosses the transition region, the
transition region is lifted up. As a result, we obtain a chromospheric jet as
the lifted transition region. When magnetic reconnection takes place in the
upper chromosphere, the chromospheric plasma is accelerated due to the
combination of the Lorentz force and the whip-like motion of magnetic field. We
found that the chromospheric plasma is further accelerated through the
interaction between the transition region (steep density gradient) and a slow
shock emanating from the reconnection point. This is an MHD effect which has
not been discussed before.

favoring stricter gun control, the other promoting protection through more
weapons. We provide a scientific foundation to inform this debate, based on
mathematical, epidemiological models that quantify the dependence of
firearm-related death rates of people on gun policies. We assume a shooter
attacking a single individual or a crowd. Two strategies can minimize deaths in
the model, depending on parameters: either a ban of private firearms
possession, or a policy allowing the general population to carry guns. In
particular, the outcome depends on the fraction of offenders that illegally
possess a gun, on the degree of protection provided by gun ownership, and on
the fraction of the population who take up their right to own a gun and carry
it with them when attacked, parameters that can be estimated from statistical
data. With the measured parameters, the model suggests that if the gun law is
enforced at a level similar to that in the United Kingdom, gun-related deaths
are minimized if private possession of firearms is banned. If such a policy is
not practical or possible due to constitutional or cultural constraints, the
model and parameter estimation indicate that a partial reduction in firearm
availability can lead to a reduction in gun-induced death rates, even if they
are not minimized. Most importantly, our analysis identifies the crucial
parameters that determine which policy reduces the death rates, providing
guidance for future statistical studies that will be necessary for more refined
quantitative predictions.

wavefunction phase $\theta_n$ at $T_c$ and the subsequent unlocking by a

the transition to the Meissner state in cuprate superconductors. They are
absent in low-$T_c$ superconductors to our knowledge. We also stress the
importance of the vortex liquid state, as well as the profiles of the melting

However, despite of a large literature on the genetics of dental development,

morphology. Here, we aim to test whether and to what extent the environment
plays a role in producing morphological variation in human teeth. We selected a
sample of modern human skulls and we used dental enamel hypoplasia as an
environmental stress marker in order to identify two groups with different
stress level, referred to as SG (""stressed"" group) and NSG (""non-stressed""
group). We collected data on the occurrence and the relative development of 15
morphological traits (5 for each molar) on upper molars using a standard
methodology commonly used in dental anthropology (ASU-DAS system) and then we
compared the frequencies of the traits in the two groups. Overall, the results
suggest that: (i) stressors like malnutrition and/or systemic diseases have a
significant effect on upper molar morphology; (ii) stress generates a
developmental response which increases the morphological variability of the SG;
(iii) the increase of variability is directional, since individuals belonging
to the SG have increased cusps dimensions and number. These results are
consistent with the expectations of the morphodynamic model of dental
development (Jernvall, 1995).

are addressed with the help of density functional theory calculations. These
issues mainly arise from the growth of nanowires under conditions different
from those used for thin films or bulk GaAs, such as the co-existence of
zincblende and wurtzite polytypes, the use of gold particles as catalyst, and
the arsenic-limited growth regime. Hence, we carry out density-functional
calculations for As vacancies, Ga_As antisites, and Au impurities in ZB and WZ
GaAs crystals. Our results show that As vacancies can diffuse within in a ZB
GaAs crystal with migration barriers of ~1.9 eV. Within WZ GaAs, As vacancy
diffusion is found to be anisotropic, with low barriers of 1.60 up to 1.79 eV
(depending on doping conditions) in the ab-plane, while there are higher
barriers of 2.07 to 2.44 eV to diffuse along the c-axis. The formation energy
of Au impurities is found to be generally much lower than those of arsenic
vacancies or Ga_As antisites. Thus, Au impurities will be the dominant defects
formed in Au-catalyzed nanowire growth. Moreover, we find that it is
energetically more favorable by 1 to 2 eV for an Au impurity to replace a
lattice Ga atom than a lattice As atom in GaAs. An Au substitutional defect for
a lattice Ga atom in ZB GaAs is found to create a charge transfer level in the
lower half of the band gap. While our calculations locate this level at E_v +
0.22eV, taking into account the inaccuracy of the density functional that ought
to be corrected by a downshift of E_v by about 0.2eV results in good agreement
with the experimental result of E_v + 0.4eV.

considered as functions of the tip position only, so-called force curves.
However, tip-surface interactions often depend on the tip velocity and the past
tip trajectory. Here, we introduce a compact and general description of these
interactions appropriate to dynamic AFM where the measurement of force is
restricted to a narrow frequency band. We represent the tip-surface interaction
in terms of a force disk in the phase space of position and velocity.
Determination of the amplitude dependence of tip-surface forces at a fixed
static probe height allows for a comprehensive treatment of conservative and
dissipative interactions. We illuminate the fundamental limitations of force
reconstruction with narrow band dynamic AFM and we show how the amplitude
dependence of the Fourier component of the force at the tip oscillation
frequency, gives qualitative insight into the detailed nature of the
tip-surface interaction. With minimal assumptions this amplitude dependence
force spectroscopy allows for a quantitative reconstruction of the effective
conservative tip-surface force as well as a position-dependent damping factor.
We demonstrate this reconstruction on simulated intermodulation AFM data.

hypothesis is circumstantial. Directly studying the accretion at the earliest
phases of stellar growth is challenging because young stars are deeply embedded
in optically thick envelopes, which have spectral energy distributions that
peak in the far-IR, where observations are difficult. In this paper, we
consider the feasibility of detecting accretion outbursts from these younger
stars by investigating the timescales for how the protostellar envelope
responds to changes in the emission properties of the central source. The
envelope heats up in response to an outburst, brightening at all wavelengths
and with the emission peak moving to shorter wavelengths. The timescale for
this change depends on the time for dust grains to heat and re-emit photons and
the time required for the energy to escape the inner, optically-thick portion
of the envelope. We find that the dust response time is much shorter than the
photon propagation time and thus the timescale over which the emission varies
is set by time delays imposed by geometry. These times are hours to days near
the peak of the spectral energy distribution and weeks to months in the sub-mm.
The ideal location to quickly detect continuum variability is therefore in the
mid- to far-IR, near the peak of the spectral energy distribution, where the
change in emission amplitude is largest. Searching for variability in sub-mm
continuum emission is also feasible, though with a longer time separation and a
weaker relationship between the amount of detected emission amplitude and
change in central source luminosity. Such observations would constrain
accretion histories of protostars and would help to trace the disk/envelope
instabilities that lead to stellar growth.

decade has been slow; we still cannot perform computation with more than about
three qubits and are no closer to solving problems of real interest than a
decade ago. Separately, recent experiments in fluid mechanics have demonstrated
the emergence of a full range of quantum phenomena from completely classical
motion. We present two specific hypotheses. First, Kuramoto theory may give a
basis for geometrical thinking about entanglement. Second, we consider a recent
soliton model of the electron, in which the quantum-mechanical wave function is
a phase modulation of a carrier wave. Both models are consistent with one
another and with observation. Both models suggest how entanglement and
decoherence may be related to device geometry. Both models predict that it will
be difficult to maintain phase coherence of more than three qubits in the
plane, or four qubits in a three-dimensional structure. The soliton model also
shows that the experimental work which appeared to demonstrate a violation of
Bell's inequalities might not actually do so; regardless of whether it is a
correct description of the world, it exposes a flaw in the logic of the Bell
tests. Thus the case for the security of EPR-based quantum cryptography has
just not been made. We propose experiments in quantum computation to test this.
Finally, we examine two possible interpretations of such soliton models: one is
consistent with the transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics, while
the other is an entirely classical model in which we do not have to abandon the
idea of a single world where action is local and causal.

move the gap creation earlier by using dipole correctors and radial position
feedback, and controlling the revolution frequency and radial position at the

progress of the momentum cogging system development is going to be discussed in

while the sample of LDE galaxies should consist of mostly (~87%) non-satellite

average SFH for each galaxy. We find that both galaxies lack a dominant burst
of early star formation, which suggests either a suppression or an
under-fueling of early star formation. From 10-12 Gyr ago, the LMC experienced
a period of enhanced stellar mass growth relative to the SMC. Similar to some
previous studies, we find two notable peaks in the SFH of the SMC at ~4.5 and 9
Gyr ago, which could be due to repeated close passages with the LMC, implying
an interaction history that has persisted for at least 9 Gyr. We find little
evidence for strong periodic behavior in the lifetime SFHs of both MCs,
suggesting that repeated encounters with the Milky Way are unlikely. Beginning
~3.5 Gyr ago, both galaxies show increases in their SFHs, in agreement with
previous studies, and thereafter, track each other remarkably well. (abridged)

non-negligible fraction of the Alfv\'en speed, so-called fast reconnection.
Until recently, the prevailing pictures of reconnection were referring to
either resistivity or plasma microscopic effects, which was contradictory to
the observed rates. The alternative picture was either reconnection due to the
stochasticity of magnetic field lines in turbulence or the tearing instability
of the thin current sheet. In this paper I simulated long-term
three-dimensional nonlinear evolution of a thin, planar current sheet subject
to fast oblique tearing instability using direct numerical simulations of
resistive-viscous MHD. The late-time evolution resembles generic turbulence
with -5/3 power spectrum and scale-dependent anisotropy, so I conclude that the
tearing-driven reconnection becomes turbulent reconnection. The turbulence is
local in scale, so microscopic diffusivity should not affect large-scale
quantities. This is confirmed by convergence of the reconnection rate towards
$\sim 0.015 v_A$ with increasing Lundquist number. In this spontaneous
reconnection with mean field and without driving the dissipation rate per unit
area also converge to $\sim 0.006 \rho v_A^3$, the dimensionless constants
$0.015$ and $0.006$ are governed only by self-driven nonlinear dynamics of the
sheared magnetic field. Remarkably, this also means that thin current sheet has
a universal fluid resistance depending only on its length to width ratio and to
$v_A/c$.

physics. We first demonstrate that such two-component simulations require an
unconventional match between force and mass resolution (i.e. force softening on
at least the mean particle separation scale). Otherwise, the growth on any
scale is not correctly recovered because of a spurious coupling between the two
species at the smallest scales. With these simulations, we then demonstrate how
the primordial differences in the clustering of baryons and DM are
progressively diminished over time. In particular, we explicitly show how the
BAO signature is damped in the spatial distribution of baryons and imprinted in
that of DM. This is a rapid process, yet it is still not fully completed at low
redshifts. On large scales, the overall shape of the correlation function of
baryons and DM differs by 2% at z = 9 and by 0.2% at z = 0. The differences in
the amplitude of the BAO peak are approximately a factor of 5 larger: 10% at z

expected to be introduced by galaxy formation physics in both the shape of the

nuclei by Power et al. (2011) uses an accretion disc particle to represent both
the black hole and its accretion disc. We have extrapolated and adapted this
approach to simulations of Milky Way-sized galaxy mergers containing black
holes and explored the impact of the various parameters in this model as well
as its resolution dependence. The two key parameters in the model are an
effective accretion radius, which determines the radius within which gas
particles are added to the accretion disc, and a viscous time-scale which
determines how long it takes for material in the accretion disc to accrete on
to the black hole itself. We find that there is a limited range of permitted
accretion radii and viscous time-scales, with unphysical results produced
outside this range. For permitted model parameters, the nuclear regions of
simulations with the same resolution follow similar evolutionary paths,
producing final black hole masses that are consistent within a factor of two.
When comparing the resolution dependence of the model, there is a trend towards
higher resolution producing slightly lower mass black holes, but values for the
two resolutions studied again agree within a factor of two. We also compare
these results to two other AGN feedback algorithms found in the literature.
While the evolution of the systems vary, most notably the intermediate total
black hole mass, the final black hole masses differ by less than a factor of
five amongst all of our models, and the remnants exhibit similar structural
parameters. The implication of this accretion model is that, unlike most
accretion algorithms, a decoupling of the accretion rate on to the black hole
and the local gas properties is permitted and obtained; this allows for black
hole growth even after feedback has prevented additional accretion events on to
the disc.

simulation of a disk of 20 earth masses, forming planets around a solar mass
star, and assuming a power law surface density distribution $\propto a^{-1.5}$.
  The output of the Monte Carlo model is then subjected to the selection
effects that mimic the observations of a transiting planet search such as that
performed by the Kepler satellite. The resulting comparison of the output to
the properties of the observed sample yields an encouraging agreement in terms
of the relative frequencies of multiple planet systems and the distribution of
the mutual inclinations, when moderate tidal circularisation is taken into
account. The broad features of the period distribution and radius distribution
can also be matched within this framework, although the model underpredicts the
distribution of small period ratios. This likely indicates that some
dissipation is still required in the formation process.
  The most striking deviation between model and observations is in the ratio of
single to multiple systems, in that there are roughly 50% more single planet
candidates observed than are produced in any model population. This suggests
that some systems must suffer additional attrition to reduce the number of

for R > 30km has not been modified by collisional evolution over the age of the
solar system, and that the size distribution below R ~ 30km has been modified
by collisions and that its slope is well matched by collisional evolution
models that use published strength laws. We investigate in detail the resulting
size distribution of bodies ranging from 0.01km to 30km and find that its slope
changes several times as a function of radius before approaching the expected
value for an equilibrium collisional cascade of material strength dominated
bodies for R < 0.1km. Compared to a single power law size distribution that
would span the whole range from 0.01km to 30km, we find a strong deficit of
bodies around R ~10km and a strong excess of bodies around 2km. This deficit
and excess are caused by an excess mass in small planetesimals in the km size
range that was left over from the runaway growth phase and that leaves a
signature in the size distribution that is not erased after 4.5 Gyrs of
collisional evolution. Observations of the small KBO size distribution can
therefore test if large KBOs grew as a result of runaway growth and constrain
the initial planetesimal sizes. We find that results from recent KBO
occultation surveys and the observed KBO size distribution can be best matched
by an initial planetesimal population that contained about equal mass per
logarithmic mass bin in bodies ranging from 0.4km to 4km in radius. In
addition, we find that we cannot match the observed KBO size distribution if
most of the planetesimal mass was contained in bodies that were 10km in radius
or larger.

increased amplitude of corrugation the region of the phase diagram where

the stronger capillary condensation is an increased contact area between the

curves at colloid gas-liquid coexistence show that the increased area is not

be computed from a peak-background split or the widespread local bias model.
However, numerical simulations clearly support the prediction of the former, in
which the non-Gaussian amplitude is proportional to the linear halo bias. To
understand better the reasons behind the failure of standard Lagrangian local
bias, in which the halo overdensity is a function of the local mass overdensity
only, we explore the effect of a primordial bispectrum on the 2-point
correlation of discrete density peaks. We show that the effective local bias
expansion to peak clustering vastly simplifies the calculation. We generalize
this approach to excursion set peaks and demonstrate that the resulting
non-Gaussian amplitude, which is a weighted sum of quadratic bias factors,
precisely agrees with the peak-background split expectation, which is a
logarithmic derivative of the halo mass function with respect to the
normalisation amplitude. We point out that statistics of thresholded regions
can be computed using the same formalism. Our results suggest that halo
clustering statistics can be modelled consistently (in the sense that the
Gaussian and non-Gaussian bias factors agree with peak-background split
expectations) from a Lagrangian bias relation only if the latter is specified
as a set of constraints imposed on the linear density field. This is clearly
not the case of standard Lagrangian local bias. Therefore, one is led to
consider additional variables beyond the local mass overdensity.

intentionally shift incident angle information contained in a high-quality XRR

assess the effect angle misalignment has on parameter estimation. We develop a

linearity with measurement misalignment from buried AlAs and GaAs layers, in
contrast to the surface layers, which show the most instability. This is a
fortuitous result, as buried AlAs and GaAs exhibit the highest long-term
stability in thickness. Therefore, it is indeed possible to use reference

density information also shows promise as a robust calibration approach. This
is suprising, as electron density of buried layers is both a highly-correlated

cosmic rays rather efficiently. We propose a framework to deal with electron

dropped over a highly viscous oil bath. These droplets bounce vertically on the
surface of the bath and exhibit many periodic trajectories and resonant modes

energy dissipation in droplets at each bounce. We propose to model droplets
using a bouncing mass-spring-damper system that mimics a deformable droplet
bouncing on a non-deformable liquid bath. From the experimental measurements,
we constructed bifurcation diagrams of the bouncing trajectories and challenged
our bouncing spring model. The agreement between experiment and the spring

exponent but not the capacity of single-user memoryless channels. Recently
Polyanskiy et al. studied the benefit of variable-length feedback with
termination (VLFT) codes in the non-asymptotic regime. In that work,
achievability is based on an infinite length random code and decoding is
attempted at every symbol. The coding rate backoff from capacity due to channel
dispersion is greatly reduced with feedback, allowing capacity to be approached
with surprisingly small expected latency. This paper is mainly concerned with
VLFT codes based on finite-length codes and decoding attempts only at certain
specified decoding times. The penalties of using a finite block-length $N$ and
a sequence of specified decoding times are studied. This paper shows that
properly scaling $N$ with the expected latency can achieve the same performance
up to constant terms as with $N = \infty$. The penalty introduced by periodic
decoding times is a linear term of the interval between decoding times and
hence the performance approaches capacity as the expected latency grows if the
interval between decoding times grows sub-linearly with the expected latency.

  Results: Our results show that including a three-body component in the

autonomous systems because it is domain invariant and allows for an intuitive
interpretation. This paper studies the use of the predictive information (PI),
also called excess entropy or effective measure complexity, of the sensorimotor
process as a driving force to generate behavior. We study nonlinear and
nonstationary systems and introduce the time-local predicting information
(TiPI) which allows us to derive exact results together with explicit update
rules for the parameters of the controller in the dynamical systems framework.
In this way the information principle, formulated at the level of behavior, is
translated to the dynamics of the synapses. We underpin our results with a
number of case studies with high-dimensional robotic systems. We show the
spontaneous cooperativity in a complex physical system with decentralized
control. Moreover, a jointly controlled humanoid robot develops a high
behavioral variety depending on its physics and the environment it is
dynamically embedded into. The behavior can be decomposed into a succession of
low-dimensional modes that increasingly explore the behavior space. This is a
promising way to avoid the curse of dimensionality which hinders learning
systems to scale well.

investigated diffusely in theoretical studies. On the other hand, only recently
has this relation been derived from X-ray observations. When that happened, the
results caused a certain level of concern: the X-ray normalizations and slopes
were found significantly dissimilar from those predicted by theory.
  We analyzed 52 objects, simulated each time with different physical recipes
for the baryonic component, as well as 60 synthetic X-ray images, to determine
if these discrepancies are real or artificial. In particular, we investigate
how the simulated concentration-mass relation depends (1) on the radial range
used to derive the concentration, (2) on the presence of baryons in the
simulations, and on the prescription used to reproduce the gas. Finally, we
evaluate (3) how the results differ when adopting an X-ray approach for the
analysis and (4) how the selection functions based on X-ray luminosity can
impact the results. All effects studied go in the direction of alleviating the
discrepancy between observations and simulations, although with different
significance: while the fitting radial range and the baryonic component play
only a minor role, the X-ray approach and selection function have profound
repercussion on the resulting concentration-mass relation.

We calculate for the first time the spin deceleration of neutron stars due to
asymmetric neutrino absorption in a toroidal magnetic field configurations. We
find a surprising effect that the deceleration can much larger for asymmetric
neutrino absorption in a toroidal magnetic field than the usually presumed
braking due to magnetic dipole radiation. This may explain the observation that
magnetars appear to have had a more rapid deceleration in the past.

technique to monitor activities in wireless infrastructure networks for fault
diagnosis, resource management and critical path analysis. In this paper, we
introduce a quality of monitoring (QoM) metric defined by the expected number
of active users monitored, and investigate the problem of maximizing QoM by
judiciously assigning sniffers to channels based on the knowledge of user
activities in a multi-channel wireless network. Two types of capture models are
considered. The user-centric model assumes frame-level capturing capability of
sniffers such that the activities of different users can be distinguished while
the sniffer-centric model only utilizes the binary channel information (active
or not) at a sniffer. For the user-centric model, we show that the implied
optimization problem is NP-hard, but a constant approximation ratio can be
attained via polynomial complexity algorithms. For the sniffer-centric model,
we devise stochastic inference schemes to transform the problem into the
user-centric domain, where we are able to apply our polynomial approximation
algorithms. The effectiveness of our proposed schemes and algorithms is further
evaluated using both synthetic data as well as real-world traces from an
operational WLAN.

at young supernova remnants (SNRs). At present, since the magnetic field
configuration around the shocks of SNRs is uncertain, it is not clear whether
electron acceleration is limited by SNR age, synchrotron cooling, or even
escape from the acceleration region. We study whether the acceleration
mechanism can be constrained by the cutoff shape of the electron spectrum
around the maximum energy. We derive analytical formulae of the cutoff shape in
each case where the maximum electron energy is determined by SNR age,
synchrotron cooling and escape from the shock. They are related to the energy
dependence of the electron diffusion coefficient. Next, we discuss whether
information on the cutoff shape can be provided by observations in the near
future which will simply give the photon indices and the flux ratios in the
soft and hard X-ray bands. We find that if the power-law index of the electron
spectrum is independently determined by other observations, then we can
constrain the cutoff shape by comparing theoretical predictions of the photon
indices and/or the flux ratios with observed data which will be measured by
NuSTAR and/or ASTRO-H. Such study is helpful in understanding the acceleration
mechanism. In particular, it will supply another independent constraint on the
magnetic field strength around the shocks of SNRs.

participating deuterons have energy in the range of 105 eV and have a
directionality of toroidal motion. Theoretical models of these devices assume
that the plasma evolves through a purely irrotational flow and thus fail to
predict such solenoidal flow on the scale of the plasma dimensions. Predictions
of a relaxation theory are consistent with experimental data [S K H Auluck,
Physics of Plasmas,18, 032508 (2011)], but the assumptions upon which it is
based are not compatible with known features of these devices. There is thus no
satisfactory theoretical construct which provides the necessity for solenoidal
flow in these devices. This paper proposes such theoretical construct, namely,
the principle of constrained dynamics, and describes an experiment which
provides support for this idea. The experiment consisted of low inductance,
self-breaking spark discharge in helium at a pressure ~100 hPa between two
pointed electrodes separated by 30-50 mm distance kept inside a vacuum chamber
mounted on a low inductance high voltage capacitor. The current derivative
signal showed reproducible sharp dips at all the extrema of the damped
sinusoidal discharge. A planar diamagnetic loop centered with and perpendicular
to the discharge axis consistently showed a signal representing rate of change
of axial magnetic flux. A qualitative explanation of observed phenomena is
obtained using a simple model using the proposed principle.

metallicity-luminosity relationship for these galaxies is analyzed; the
galaxies discussed in this paper appear to be under-abundant at a given

identify a ""second parameter"" responsible for the intrinsic scatter and
apparent under-abundance of our galaxies. We do not find a definitive second
parameter but note the possible indication that infall or mixing of pristine

an isolated HII region and the rest of the galaxy. Our data set includes the

abundance analysis of this galaxy reveals that it is strongly over-enriched

communication to reduce the energy consumption in cellular networks. Since
today's wireless terminals are typically equipped with multiple network access
interfaces such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and cellular networks, this paper
investigates user terminals cooperating with each other in transmitting their
data packets to a base station (BS) by exploiting the multiple network access
interfaces, referred to as inter-network cooperation, to improve the energy
efficiency in cellular uplink transmission. Given target outage probability and
data rate requirements, we develop a closed-form expression of energy
efficiency in Bits-per-Joule for the inter-network cooperation by taking into
account the path loss, fading, and thermal noise effects. Numerical results
show that when the cooperating users move towards to each other, the proposed
inter-network cooperation significantly improves the energy efficiency as
compared with the traditional non-cooperation and intra-network cooperation.
This implies that given a certain amount of bits to be transmitted, the
inter-network cooperation requires less energy than the traditional
non-cooperation and intra-network cooperation, showing the energy saving
benefit of inter-network cooperation.

magnetic energy and produce a wide variety of active solar phenomena, like
flare and coronal mass ejections(CMEs). The distribution and strength of
magnetic fields are routinely measured in the solar surface(photosphere).
Therefore, there is considerable interest in accurately modeling the 3D
structure of the coronal magnetic field using photospheric vector magnetograms.
Knowledge of the 3D structure of magnetic field lines also help us to interpret
other coronal observations, e.g., EUV images of the radiating coronal plasma.
Nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) models are thought to be viable tools for
those task. Usually those models use Cartesian geometry. However, the spherical
nature of the solar surface cannot be neglected when the field of view is
large. In this work, we model the coronal magnetic field above multiple active
regions using NLFFF extrapolation code using vector magnetograph data from the
Synoptic Optical Long-term Investigations of the Sun survey (SOLIS)/ Vector
Spectromagnetograph (VSM) as a boundary conditions. We compare projections of
the resulting magnetic field lines solutions with their respective coronal
EUV-images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA) observed on October
11, 2011 and November 13, 2012. This study has found that the NLFFF model in
spherical geometry reconstructs the magnetic configurations for several active
regions which agrees with observations. During October 11, 2011 observation,
there are substantial number of trans-equatorial loops carrying electric

social and biological networks) there is a renewed interest on realizations of

sequence problem: we want to find graphical realizations of a given degree
sequence on labeled vertices, where certain would-be edges are {\em forbidden}.
Then we want to sample uniformly and efficiently all these possible
realizations. (This problem can be considered as a special case of Tutte's
$f$-factor problem, however it has a favorable sampling speed.)
  We solve this {\em restricted degree sequence} (or RDS for short) problem
completely if the forbidden edges form a bipartite graph, which consist of the
union of a (not necessarily maximal) 1-factor and a (possible empty) star. Then
we show how one can sample the space of all realizations of these RDSs
uniformly and efficiently when the degree sequence describes a {\em
half-regular} bipartite graph. Our result contains, as special cases, the
well-known result of Kannan, Tetali and Vempala on sampling regular bipartite
graphs and a recent result of Greenhill on sampling regular directed graphs (so
it also provides new proofs of them).
  The RDS problem descried above is self-reducible, therefore our {\em fully
polynomial almost uniform sampler} (a.k.a. FPAUS) on the space of all
realizations also provides a {\em fully polynomial randomized approximation

Survey Facility - Magellanic Cloud Point Source Catalog (IRSF-MCPSC). The
observed LMC region is divided into several sub-regions and stars in each
region are cross identified with the optically identified red clump stars to
obtain the near infrared magnitudes. The peak values of H magnitude and (J-H)
colour of the observed red clump distribution are obtained by fitting a profile
to the distributions and also by taking the average value of magnitude and
colour of the red clump stars in the bin with largest number. Then the
dereddened peak H0 magnitude of the red clump stars in each sub-region is
obtained. The RA, Dec and relative distance from the center of each sub-region
are converted into x, y & z Cartesian coordinates. A weighted least square
plane fitting method is applied to this x,y,z data to estimate the structural
parameters of the LMC disk. A reddening map based on (J-H) colour of the RC
stars is presented. When the peaks of the red clump distribution were
identified by averaging, an inclination of 25.7 +/- 1.6 and PA_lon = 141.5 +/-
4.5 were obtained. We estimate a distance modulus of 18.47 +/- 0.1 mag to the
LMC. Extra-planar features which are in front as well as behind the fitted
plane are identified which match with the optically identified extra-planar
features. The bar of the LMC is found to be part of the disk within 500 pc. The
estimates of the structural parameters are found to be independent of the

excited as if it is exposed to the thermal bath with temperature proportional
to its acceleration. In the inertial frame, since both of an excitation and a
deexcitation of the detector are accompanied by emission of radiation into the
Minkowski vacuum, one may suspect that the Unruh detector emits radiation like
the Larmor radiation from an accelerated charged particle. However, it is known
that the radiation is miraculously cancelled by a quantum interference effect.
In this paper, we investigate under what condition the radiation cancels out.
We first show that the cancellation occurs if the Green function satisfies a
relation similar to the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition. We then study
two examples, Unruh detectors in the 3+1 dimensional Minkowski spacetime and in
the de Sitter spacetime. In both cases, the relation holds only in a restricted
region of the spacetime, but the radiation is cancelled in the whole spacetime.
Hence the KMS-like relation is necessary but not sufficient for the
cancellation to occur.

hard-sphere-like mixtures with large size asymmetry, at a constant volume
fraction phi = 0.61. The structure, dynamics and viscoelastic response as a
function of mixing ratio reflect a transition between caging by one or the
other component. The strongest effect of mixing is observed in systems
dominated by caging of the large component. The possibility to pack a large
number of small spheres in the free volume left by the large ones induces a
pronounced deformation of the cage of the large spheres, which become
increasingly delocalised. This results in faster dynamics and a strong
reduction of the elastic modulus. When the relative volume fraction of small
spheres exceeds that of large spheres, the small particles start to form their
own cages, slowing down the dynamics and increasing the elastic modulus of the
system. The large spheres become the minority and act as an impurity in the
ordering beyond the first neighbour shell, i.e. the cage, and do not directly
affect the particle organisation on the cage level. In such a system, when
shear at constant rate is applied, melting of the glass is observed due to
facilitated out-of-cage diffusion which is associated with structural
anisotropy induced by shear.

preserve N=1 supersymmetry. The overall U(1) serves as the hidden sector and no

triggered by the non-vanishing D term coupled to the observable sector, and is
realized by the self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation of the NJL type

that theoretical analysis is resolved as a variational problem of the effective
potential for three kinds of background fields, namely, the complex scalar, and
the two order parameters D and F of supersymmetry, the last one being treated

homogeneous layer can undergo a contractile-type instability to a polarized
moving state in which the rear is enriched in gel polymer. This agrees
qualitatively with motile cells containing an actomyosin-rich uropod at their

state at long times, sustained by a balance between contractility and filament
turnover. In addition, our model predicts an optimal value of the
gel-susbstrate adhesion leading to maximum layer speed, in agreement with cell
motility assays. The model may be relevant to motility of cells translocating
in complex, confining environments that can be mimicked experimentally by cell

  The theory is the first to predict packets of hairpin vortices and other
structure in turbulence, and their dynamics, based on an analysis of the
Navier-Stokes equations, under an assumption of a turbulent mean profile. The
assumption of the turbulent mean acts as a restriction on the class of possible
structures. It is shown that the coherent structure is a manifestation of
essentially low-dimensional flow dynamics, arising from a critical layer
mechanism. Using the decomposition presented in McKeon & Sharma (J. Fluid Mech,
658, 2010), complex coherent structure is recreated from minimal superpositions
of response modes predicted by the analysis, which take the form of
radially-varying travelling waves. By way of example, simple combinations of
these modes are offered that predicts hairpins and modulated hairpin packets.
  The phase interaction also predicts important skewness and correlation
results known in the literature.
  It is also shown that the very large scale motions act to organise
hairpin-like structures such that they co-locate with areas of low streamwise
momentum, by a mechanism of locally varying the shear profile.
  The relationship between Taylor's hypothesis and coherence is discussed and
both are shown to be the consequence of the localisation of the response modes
around the critical layer.
  A pleasing link is made to the classical laminar inviscid theory, whereby the
essential mechanism underlying the hairpin vortex is captured by two obliquely
interacting Kelvin-Stuart (cat's eye) vortices. Evidence for the theory is
presented based on comparison to observations of structure reported in the

the intersections arise due to the periodic boundary conditions. As a result,
the cyclic Wilson loop itself is not multiplicatively renormalizable, but the

be visualized using the concept of localized sets which are also corroborated

physics of electron acceleration and transport presents one of the major
questions in high-energy solar flare physics. Spatially resolved observations
of solar flares often demonstrate the presence of well-separated sources of
bremsstrahlung emission, so-called coronal and footpoint sources. Using
spatially resolved X-ray observations by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar
Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) and recently improved imaging techniques, we
investigate in detail the spatially resolved electron distributions in a few
well-observed solar flares. The selected flares can be interpreted as having a
standard geometry with chromospheric HXR footpoint sources related to
thick-target X-ray emission and the coronal sources characterised by a
combination of thermal and thin-target bremsstrahlung. Using imaging
spectroscopy techniques, we deduce the characteristic electron rates and
spectral indices required to explain the coronal and footpoint X-ray sources.
We found that, during the impulsive phase, the electron rate at the looptop is
several times (a factor of 1.7-8) higher than at the footpoints. The results
suggest that a sufficient number of electrons accelerated in the looptop
explain the precipitation into the footpoints and imply that electrons
accumulate in the looptop. We discuss these results in terms of magnetic
trapping, pitch-angle scattering, and injection properties. Our conclusion is
that the accelerated electrons must be subject to magnetic trapping and/or
pitch-angle scattering, keeping a fraction of the population trapped inside the
coronal loops. These findings put strong constraints on the particle transport
in the coronal source and provide quantitative limits on deka-keV electron
trapping/scattering in the coronal source.

here four types of paradoxes that can arise in these networks. To this end, we
use social network games that we recently introduced in arxiv:1202.2209. These
paradoxes shed light on possible inefficiencies arising when one modifies the
sets of products available to the agents forming a social network. One of the
paradoxes corresponds to the well-known Braess paradox in congestion games and
shows that by adding more choices to a node, the network may end up in a
situation that is worse for everybody. We exhibit a dual version of this, where
removing available choices from someone can eventually make everybody better
off. The other paradoxes that we identify show that by adding or removing a
product from the choice set of some node may lead to permanent instability.
Finally, we also identify conditions under which some of these paradoxes cannot
arise.

on endoergic reactions. In J-shocks, their abundances are enhanced by several
orders of magnitude for shock velocities as low as 7 km/s. Otherwise most
chemical properties of J-type shocks vary over less than an order of magnitude
between velocities from about 7 to about 30 km/s, where H2 dissociation sets
in. C-type shocks display a more gradual molecular enhancement as the shock
velocity increases. We quantify the energy flux budget (fluxes of kinetic,
radiated and magnetic energies) with emphasis on the main cooling lines of the
cold interstellar medium. Their sensitivity to shock velocity is such that it
allows observations to constrain statistical distributions of shock velocities.
We fit various probability distribution functions (PDFs) of shock velocities to
spectroscopic observations of the galaxy-wide shock in Stephan's Quintet (SQ)
and of a Galactic line of sight sampling diffuse molecular gas in Chamaeleon.
In both cases, low velocities bear the greatest statistical weight and the PDF
is consistent with a bimodal distribution. In the very low velocity shocks
(below 5 km/s), dissipation is due to ion-neutral friction which powers H2 low
energy transitions and atomic lines. In moderate velocity shocks (20 km/s and
above), the dissipation is due to viscous heating and accounts for most of the
molecular emission. In our interpretation a significant fraction of the gas on
the line of sight is shocked (from 4% to 66%). For example, C+ emission may
trace shocks in UV irradiated gas where C+ is the dominant carbon species.

self-organization that nature employs to orchestrate essential processes of

synchrony or disorder were mutually exclusive steady states for a network of
identical oscillators, numerous theoretical studies in recent years have
revealed the intriguing possibility of `chimera states', in which the symmetry
of the oscillator population is broken into a synchronous and an asynchronous
part. However, a striking lack of empirical evidence raises the question of
whether chimeras are indeed characteristic to natural systems. This calls for a
palpable realization of chimera states without any fine-tuning, from which
physical mechanisms underlying their emergence can be uncovered. Here, we
devise a simple experiment with mechanical oscillators coupled in a
hierarchical network to show that chimeras emerge naturally from a competition
between two antagonistic synchronization patterns. We identify a wide spectrum
of complex states, encompassing and extending the set of previously described
chimeras. Our mathematical model shows that the self-organization observed in
our experiments is controlled by elementary dynamical equations from mechanics
that are ubiquitous in many natural and technological systems. The symmetry
breaking mechanism revealed by our experiments may thus be prevalent in systems
exhibiting collective behaviour, such as power grids, opto-mechanical crystals

increases the emission intensity during the switch time. The resulting

future tokamak reactors such as ITER, several steady state magnetic sensor
technologies have been considered. For all the studied technologies it is
always advantageous to place the sensors outside the vacuum vessel and as far
away from the reactor core to minimize radiation damage and temperature
effects, but not so far as to compromise the accuracy of the equilibrium
reconstruction. We have studied to what extent increasing the distance between
out-vessel sensors and plasma can be compensated for sensor accuracy and/or
density before the limit imposed by the degeneracy of the problem is reached.
The study is particularized for the Swiss TCV tokamak, due to the quality of
its magnetic data and its ability to operate with a wide range of plasma shapes
and divertor configurations. We have scanned the plasma boundary reconstruction
error as function of out-vessel sensor density, accuracy and distance to the
plasma. The study is performed for both the transient and steady state phases
of the tokamak discharge. We find that, in general, there is a broad region in
the parameter space where sensor accuracy, density and proximity to the plasma
can be traded for one another to obtain a desired level of accuracy in the
reconstructed boundary, up to some limit. Extrapolation of the results to a
tokamak reactor suggests that a hybrid configuration with sensors inside and
outside the vacuum vessel could be used to obtain a good boundary
reconstruction during both the transient and the flat-top of the discharges, if
out-vessel magnetic sensors of sufficient density and accuracy can be placed
sufficiently far outside the vessel to minimize radiation damage.

description of various cell mechanisms. It is difficult to explore these large
maps, to comment their content and to maintain them. Though there exist several
tools addressing these problems individually, the scientific community still
lacks an environment that combines these three capabilities together. NaviCell
is a web-based environment for exploiting large maps of molecular interactions,
created in CellDesigner, allowing their easy exploration, curation and
maintenance. NaviCell combines three features: (1) efficient map browsing based
on Google Maps engine; (2) semantic zooming for viewing different levels of
details or of abstraction of the map and (3) integrated web-based blog for
collecting the community feedback. NaviCell can be easily used by experts in
the field of molecular biology for studying molecular entities of their
interest in the context of signaling pathways and cross-talks between pathways
within a global signaling network. NaviCell allows both exploration of detailed
molecular mechanisms represented on the map and a more abstract view of the map
up to a top-level modular representation. NaviCell facilitates curation,
maintenance and updating the comprehensive maps of molecular interactions in an
interactive fashion due to an imbedded blogging system. NaviCell provides an
easy way to explore large-scale maps of molecular interactions, thanks to the
Google Maps and WordPress interfaces, already familiar to many users. Semantic
zooming used for navigating geographical maps is adopted for molecular maps in
NaviCell, making any level of visualization meaningful to the user. In
addition, NaviCell provides a framework for community-based map curation.

tensor's rank is proposed in this paper, as the key enabler for completion of
three-way data arrays with missing entries. Set in a Bayesian framework, the
tensor completion method incorporates prior information to enhance its
smoothing and prediction capabilities. This probabilistic approach can
naturally accommodate general models for the data distribution, lending itself
to various fitting criteria that yield optimum estimates in the
maximum-a-posteriori sense. In particular, two algorithms are devised for
Gaussian- and Poisson-distributed data, that minimize the rank-regularized
least-squares error and Kullback-Leibler divergence, respectively. The proposed
technique is able to recover the ""ground-truth'' tensor rank when tested on
synthetic data, and to complete brain imaging and yeast gene expression
datasets with 50% and 15% of missing entries respectively, resulting in
recovery errors at -10dB and -15dB.

unprecedented level of situational awareness and controllability over its
services and infrastructure. This paper advocates statistical inference methods
to robustify power monitoring tasks against the outlier effects owing to faulty
readings and malicious attacks, as well as against missing data due to privacy
concerns and communication errors. In this context, a novel load cleansing and
imputation scheme is developed leveraging the low intrinsic-dimensionality of
spatiotemporal load profiles and the sparse nature of ""bad data.'' A robust
estimator based on principal components pursuit (PCP) is adopted, which effects
a twofold sparsity-promoting regularization through an $\ell_1$-norm of the
outliers, and the nuclear norm of the nominal load profiles. Upon recasting the
non-separable nuclear norm into a form amenable to decentralized optimization,
a distributed (D-) PCP algorithm is developed to carry out the imputation and
cleansing tasks using networked devices comprising the so-termed advanced
metering infrastructure. If D-PCP converges and a qualification inequality is
satisfied, the novel distributed estimator provably attains the performance of
its centralized PCP counterpart, which has access to all networkwide data.
Computer simulations and tests with real load curve data corroborate the
convergence and effectiveness of the novel D-PCP algorithm.

several irradiation and cooling cycles at a pressure of ~10-6 torr. A
comparison of the spectra of the radiation emitted by the nanotubes indicates
that the intensity of radiation with wavelengths ranging from 700 to 1000 nm
increased substantially during the course of five irradiation and cooling

field emission-induced luminescence and that the intensity of the radiation
emitted increased due to the opening of nanotube ends. Furthermore, the
intensity of the radiation emitted by the multi-walled carbon nanotubes was
much greater than the radiation emitted by the single-walled nanotubes.
Scanning electron microscopy images indicate that most of the single-walled

low-temperature phase is characterized by a large-N scaling with theta/N as
relevant variable, while in the high-temperature phase the scaling variable is

considered as a binary classification problem between centre and surround
classes. Discriminant power of features for the classification is measured as
mutual information between distributions of image features and corresponding
classes . As the estimated discrepancy very much depends on considered scale
level, multi-scale structure and discriminant power are integrated by employing
discrete wavelet features and Hidden Markov Tree (HMT). With wavelet
coefficients and Hidden Markov Tree parameters, quad-tree like label structures
are constructed and utilized in maximum a posterior probability (MAP) of hidden
class variables at corresponding dyadic sub-squares. Then, a saliency value for
each square block at each scale level is computed with discriminant power
principle. Finally, across multiple scales is integrated the final saliency map
by an information maximization rule. Both standard quantitative tools such as
NSS, LCC, AUC and qualitative assessments are used for evaluating the proposed
multi-scale discriminant saliency (MDIS) method against the well-know
information based approach AIM on its released image collection with
eye-tracking data. Simulation results are presented and analysed to verify the
validity of MDIS as well as point out its limitation for further research

with a seismic wave is to modify the global properties of the medium, acting on
the soil density and then on the wave velocity. The main concept is then to
reduce the amplification of seismic waves at the free surface, called site

the seismic signal is by modifying the distribution of seismic energy thanks to
a metamaterial made of a grid of vertical, cylindrical and empty inclusions

interference, and the desired signals.
  We study the design of power allocation algorithms maximizing the energy
efficiency of data transmission (bit/Joule delivered to the receiver). In
particular, the algorithm design is formulated as a high-dimensional non-convex
optimization problem which takes into account the circuit power consumption,
the minimum required data rate, and a constraint on the minimum power delivered
to the receiver. Subsequently, by exploiting the properties of nonlinear
fractional programming, the considered non-convex optimization problem, whose
objective function is in fractional form, is transformed into an equivalent
optimization problem having an objective function in subtractive form, which
enables the derivation of an efficient iterative power allocation algorithm. In
each iteration, the optimal power allocation solution is derived based on dual
decomposition and a one-dimensional search. Simulation results illustrate that
the proposed iterative power allocation algorithm converges to the optimal
solution, and unveil the trade-off between energy efficiency, system capacity,
and wireless power transfer: (1) In the low transmit power regime, maximizing
the system capacity may maximize the energy efficiency. (2) Wireless power
transfer can enhance the energy efficiency, especially in the interference
limited regime.

limit of long lifetimes, the lifetime effect is irrelevant and the transition
is directly from the fully polarized to the FFLO state. We show, however, that
for sufficiently short lifetimes there is a quantum critical point (QCP), at a

on a quantum interferometer are dependent on the latitude and direction of the
interferometer on Earth in orbital motion around Sun. Continuing work initiated
in the earlier publication [Okawara, Yamada and Asada, Phys. Rev. Lett. 109,
231101 (2012)], we perform numerical calculations of time variation in the
induced phase shifts for nonequatorial cases. We show that the maximum phase
shift at any latitude might occur at 6, 0 (and 12), and 18 hours (in local
time) of each day, when the normal vector to the interferometer is vertical,
eastbound and northbound, respectively. If two identical interferometers were
located at different latitudes, the difference between two phase shifts that
are measured at the same local time would be $O(\sin \delta\varphi)$ for a
small latitude difference $\delta\varphi$. It might thus become maximally $\sim
20$ percents for $\delta\varphi \sim 10$ degrees, for instance.

any program that is cleverer than a human being, is acknowledged as Artificial

the concept of human being. The readers of papers [1] and [2] might be left
with the impression that both definitions are equivalent and the definition in

  2014",,,,"math.GN math.AC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  By a characterization of semiprime $SA$-rings by Birkenmeier, Ghirati and
Taherifar in \cite[Theorem 4.4]{B}, and by the topological characterization of
$C(X)$ as a Baer-ring by Stone and Nakano in \cite[Theorem 3.25]{KM}, it is
easy to see that $C(X)$ is an $SA$-ring (resp., $IN$-ring) \ifif $X$ is an
extremally disconnected space. This result motivates the following questions:
Question $(1)$: What is $X$ if for any two ideals $I$ and $J$ of $C(X)$ which
are generated by two subsets of idempotents, $Ann(I)+Ann(J)=Ann(I\cap J)?$
Question $(2)$: When does for any ideal $I$ of $C(X)$ exists a subset $S$ of
idempotents such that $Ann(I)=Ann(S)$? Along the line of answering these
questions we introduce two classes of topological spaces. We call $X$ an
$\textit{EF}$ (resp., $\textit{EZ}$)-$\textit{space}$ if disjoint unions of
clopen sets are completely separated (resp., every regular closed subset is the
closure of a union of clopen subsets). Topological properties of $\textit{EF}$
(resp., $\textit{EZ}$)-$\textit{spaces}$ are investigated. As a consequence, a
completely regular Hausdorff space $X$ is an $F_{\alpha}$-space in the sense of
Comfort and Negrepontis for each infinite cardinal $\alpha$ \ifif $X$ is an
$EF$ and $EZ$-space. Among other things, for a reduced ring $R$ (resp.,
$J(R)=0$) we show that $Spec(R)$ (resp., $Max(R)$) is an $EZ$-space \ifif for
every ideal $I$ of $R$ there exists a subset $S$ of idempotents of $R$ such
that $Ann(I)=Ann(S)$.

magnets (SMMs), which exhibit both uniaxial and transverse magnetic anisotropy,
is considered theoretically. The main focus is on the impact of transverse
anisotropy on transport characteristics and the adatom's/SMM's spin. In
particular, we analyze the role of quantum tunneling of magnetization (QTM) in
the mechanism of the current-induced spin switching, and show that the QTM
phenomenon becomes revealed as resonant peaks in the average values of the
molecule's spin and in the charge current. These features appear at some
resonant fields and are observable when at least one of the electrodes is
ferromagnetic. We also show that the conductance generally depends on the
relative orientation of the average adatom's/SMM's spin and electrode's
magnetic moment. This spin-valve like magnetoresistance effect can be used to
control spin switching of the adatom's/SMM's spin.

fabricated by rf sputtering method at different oxygen partial pressures, were
systematically investigated. It has been found that preferred growth
orientation of SnO$_2$ film is strongly related to the oxygen partial pressure
during deposition, which provides an effective way to tune the surface texture
of SnO$_2$ film. All films reveal relatively high transparency in the visible
range, and both the transmittance and optical band gap increase with increasing
oxygen partial pressure. The temperature dependence of resisitivities was
measured from 380 K down to liquid helium temperatures. At temperature above
$\sim 80$ K, besides the nearest-neighbor-hopping process, thermal activation
processes related to two donor levels ($\sim 30$ and $\sim 100$ meV below the
conduction band minimum) of oxygen vacancies are responsible for the charge
transport properties. Below $\sim 80$ K, Mott variable-range-hopping conduction
process governs the charge transport properties at higher temperatures, while
Efros-Shklovskii variable-range-hopping conduction process dominates the
transport properties at lower temperatures. Distinct crossover from Mott type
to Efros-Shklovskii type variable-range-hopping conduction process at several
to a few tens kelvin are observed for all SnO$_2$ films.

tunnelling can even dominate electron transport for a certain region of

disappears and the differential conductance scales as a power low on

User (SU) using best-effort transmission to a spectrum with an incumbent
Primary User (PU), which uses Type-I Hybrid ARQ. The technique leverages the
primary ARQ protocol to perform Interference Cancellation (IC) at the SU
receiver (SUrx). Two IC mechanisms that work in concert are introduced: Forward
IC, where SUrx, after decoding the PU message, cancels its interference in the
(possible) following PU retransmissions of the same message, to improve the SU
throughput; Backward IC, where SUrx performs IC on previous SU transmissions,
whose decoding failed due to severe PU interference. Secondary access policies
are designed that determine the secondary access probability in each state of
the network so as to maximize the average long-term SU throughput by
opportunistically leveraging IC, while causing bounded average long-term PU
throughput degradation and SU power expenditure. It is proved that the optimal
policy prescribes that the SU prioritizes its access in the states where SUrx
knows the PU message, thus enabling IC. An algorithm is provided to optimally
allocate additional secondary access opportunities in the states where the PU
message is unknown. Numerical results are shown to assess the throughput gain
provided by the proposed techniques.

low in the radiative output of the Sun that was temporally coincident with the
largest cosmic ray flux ever measured at 1AU. A hemispheric asymmetry in
magnetic activity is clearly observed and its evolution monitored and the
resulting (prolonged) magnetic imbalance must have had a considerable impact on
the structure and energetics of the heliosphere. While we cannot uniquely tie
the variance and scale of the surface magnetism to the dwindling radiative and
particulate output of the star, or the increased cosmic ray flux through the
2009 minimum, the timing of the decline and rapid recovery in early 2010 would
appear to inextricably link them. These observations support a picture where
the Sun's hemispheres are significantly out of phase with each other. Studying
historical sunspot records with this picture in mind shows that the northern
hemisphere has been leading since the middle of the last century and that the
hemispheric ""dominance"" has changed twice in the past 130 years. The
observations presented give clear cause for concern, especially with respect to
our present understanding of the processes that produce the surface magnetism
in the (hidden) solar interior - hemispheric asymmetry is the normal state -
the strong symmetry shown in 1996 was abnormal. Further, these observations
show that the mechanism(s) which create and transport the magnetic flux
magnetic flux are slowly changing with time and, it appears, with only loose
coupling across the equator such that those asymmetries can persist for a
considerable time. As the current asymmetry persists and the basal energetics
of the system continue to dwindle we anticipate new radiative and particulate
lows coupled with increased cosmic ray fluxes heading into the next solar
minimum.

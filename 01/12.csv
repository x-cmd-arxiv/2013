  Algorithm Protein network",,,,"q-bio.MN q-bio.CB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Systems Biology has emerged in the last years as a new holistic approach
based on the global understanding of cells instead of only being focused on
their individual parts (genes or proteins), to better understand the complexity
of human cells. Since the Systems Biology still does not provide the most
accurate answers to our questions due to the complexity of cells and the
limited quality of available information to perform a good gene/protein map
analysis, we have created simpler models to ensure easier analysis of the map
that represents the human cell. Therefore, a virtual organism has been designed
according to the main physiological rules for humans in order to replicate the
human organism and its vital functions. This toy model was constructed by
defining the topology of its genes/proteins and the biological functions
associated to it. There are several examples of these toy models that emulate
natural processes to perform analysis of the virtual life in order to design
the best strategy to understand real life. The strategy applied in this study
combines topological and functional analysis integrating the knowledge about
the relative position of a node among the others in the map with the
conclusions generated by mathematical models that reproduce functional data of
the virtual organism. Our results demonstrate that the combination of both
strategies allows better understanding of our virtual organism even with the
lower input of information needed and therefore it can be a potential tool to
better understand the real life.

modelling of the evolution of radio galaxy lobes. The emphasis of our work is
on including realistic hot-gas environments in the simulations and on
establishing what properties of the resulting radio lobes are independent of
the choice of environmental properties and of other features of the models such
as the initial jet Mach number. The simulated jet power we use is chosen so
that we expect the inner parts of the lobes to come into pressure balance with
the external medium on large scales; we show that this leads to the expected
departure from self-similarity and the formation of characteristic central
structures in the hot external medium. The work done by the expanding radio
lobes on the external hot gas is roughly equal to the energy stored in the
lobes for all our simulations once the lobes are well established. We show that
the external pressure at the lobe midpoint is a reasonable estimate of the
internal (lobe) pressure, with only a weak dependence on the environmental
parameters: on the other hand, the predicted radio emission from a source of a
given physical size has a comparatively strong dependence on the environment in
which the lobe resides, introducing an order of magnitude of scatter into the
jet power versus radio luminosity relationship. X-ray surface brightness and
temperature visualizations of our simulations bear a striking resemblance to
observations of some well-studied radio galaxies.

structured on graphs. A central problem is determining the probability that a
small number of mutants overtake a population. Currently, Monte Carlo
simulations are used for estimating such fixation probabilities on general
directed graphs, since no good analytical methods exist. In this paper, we
introduce a novel deterministic framework for computing fixation probabilities
for strongly connected, directed, weighted evolutionary graphs under neutral
drift. We show how this framework can also be used to calculate the expected
number of mutants at a given time step (even if we relax the assumption that
the graph is strongly connected), how it can extend to other related models
(e.g. voter model), how our framework can provide non-trivial bounds for
fixation probability in the case of an advantageous mutant, and how it can be
used to find a non-trivial lower bound on the mean time to fixation. We provide
various experimental results determining fixation probabilities and expected
number of mutants on different graphs. Among these, we show that our method
consistently outperforms Monte Carlo simulations in speed by several orders of
magnitude. Finally we show how our approach can provide insight into synaptic
competition in neurology.

$g_{\phi\phi}$. The aim of this work is to generalize this previous model by
introducing bulk viscosity and compare it to the non-viscous collapse. The
behavior of the density, pressure, mass, luminosity and the effective adiabatic
index is analyzed. Our work is also compared to the case of a collapsing fluid
with bulk viscosity of another previous model, for a star with 6 $M_{\odot}$.
The pressure of the star, at the beginning of the collapse, is isotropic but
due to the presence of the bulk viscosity the pressure becomes more and more
anisotropic. The black hole is never formed because the apparent horizon
formation condition is never satisfied, in contrast of the previous model where
a black hole is formed. An observer at infinity sees a radial point source
radiating exponentially until reaches the time of maximum luminosity and
suddenly the star turns off. In contrast of the former model where the
luminosity also increases exponentially, reaching a maximum and after it
decreases until the formation of the black hole. The effective adiabatic index
diminishes due to the bulk viscosity, thus increasing the instability of the
system, in both models, in the former paper and in this work.

migration. Such signatures may be detected in the Milky Way by Gaia (and
complementary spectroscopic data), as well as in external galaxies, by IFU

symplectic manifold with respect to a regular Lagrangian foliation via sheaf
cohomology and obtain important new applications in the case of real
polarizations. The starting point is the definition of representation spaces
due to Kostant. Besides the classical examples of Gelfand-Cetlin systems due to
Guillemin and Sternberg very few examples of explicit computations of real
polarizations are known. The computation of Geometric Quantization for
Gelfand-Cetlin systems is based on a theorem due to \'Sniatycki for fibrations
which identifies the representation space with the set of Bohr-Sommerfeld
leaves determined by the integral action coordinates.
  In this article we check that the associated sheaf cohomology apparatus of
Geometric Quantization satisfies Mayer-Vietoris and K\""unneth formulae. As a
consequence, a new short proof of this classical result for fibrations due to
\'Sniatycki is obtained. We also compute Geometric Quantization with respect to
any generic regular Lagrangian foliation on a 2-torus and the case of the
irrational flow. In the way, we recover some classical results in the
computation of foliated cohomology of these polarizations.

2012. The antennas are connected directly to the data acquisition of the Tunka
main detector, a 1 square-km large array of 133 non-imaging photomultipliers
observing the Cherenkov light of air showers in dark and clear nights. This
allows to cross-calibrate the radio signal with the air-Cherenkov signal of the
same air showers - in particular with respect to the energy and the atmospheric
depth of the shower maximum, Xmax. Consequently, we can test whether in rural
regions with low radio background the practically achievable radio precision
comes close to the precision of the established fluorescence and air-Cherenkov
techniques. At a mid-term perspective, due to its higher duty-cycle, Tunka-Rex
can enhance the effective observing time of Tunka by an order of magnitude, at
least in the interesting energy range above 100 PeV. Moreover, Tunka-Rex is
very cost-effective, e.g., by using economic Short Aperiodic Loaded Loop
Antennas (SALLAs). Thus, the results of Tunka-Rex and the comparison to other
sophisticated radio arrays will provide crucial input for future large-scale
cosmic-ray observatories, for which measurement precision as well as costs per

showers via digital radio interferometry. We summarize the status of LOPES and
recent results. In particular, we present an update on the reconstruction of
the primary-particle properties based on almost 500 events above 100 PeV. With
LOPES, the arrival direction can be reconstructed with a precision of at least
0.65{\deg}, and the energy with a precision of at least 20 %, which, however,
does not include systematic uncertainties on the absolute energy scale. For
many particle and astrophysics questions the reconstruction of the atmospheric
depth of the shower maximum, Xmax, is important, since it yields information on
the type of the primary particle and its interaction with the atmosphere.
Recently, we found experimental evidence that the slope of the radio lateral
distribution is indeed sensitive to the longitudinal development of the air
shower, but unfortunately, the Xmax precision at LOPES is limited by the high
level of anthropogenic radio background. Nevertheless, the developed methods
can be transferred to next generation experiments with lower background, which
should provide an Xmax precision competitive to other detection technologies.

theory of fermionic superfluids and address temperatures both above and below
the transition temperature $T_c$. We emphasize two independent constraints, one
associated with gauge invariance (and the related Ward identity) and another
associated with the compressibility sum rule, both of which are satisfied in
strict BCS theory. However, we point out that it is the rare many body theory
which satisfies both of these. Indeed, well studied quantum Hall systems and
random-phase approximations to the electron gas are found to have difficulties
with meeting these constraints. We summarize two distinct theoretical
approaches which are, however, demonstrably compatible with gauge invariance
and the compressibility sum rule. The first of these involves an extension of
BCS theory to a mean field description of the BCS-Bose Einstein condensation
crossover. The second is the simplest Nozieres Schmitt- Rink (NSR) treatment of
pairing correlations in the normal state. As a point of comparison we focus on
the compressibility $\kappa$ of each and contrast the predictions above $T_c$.
We note here that despite the compliance with sum rules, this NSR based scheme
leads to an unphysical divergence in $\kappa$ at the transition. Because of the
delicacy of the various consistency requirements, the results of this paper
suggest that avoiding this divergence may repair one problem while at the same
time introducing others.

diameter, a NeuWorld), that may improve the oscillation measurement and
disentangle at best any hypothetical CPT violation while testing tau appearance
at the same time of the muon disappearance correlated. The experiment use a
neutrino beam crossing the Earth, within an OPERA-like experiment from CERN (or
Fermilab), in the direction of the IceCube DeepCore detector at the South Pole.
Such a tuned beaming and its detection may lead to a strong signature of
neutrino muon-tau mixing (nearly one anti tau or two tau a day, with 10 sigma
in a year), even for an one per-cent OPERA-like NeuWorld experiment.

perfect fluid trapped in a Randall-Sundrum's Braneworld of type 2. We consider
a homogeneous but anisotropic Bianchi I brane geometry. Moreover, we consider
the effect of the projection of the five dimensional Weyl tensor onto the
three-brane in the form of a negative Dark Radiation term. For the treatment of
the potential we use the ""Method of $f$-devisers"" that allows investigating
arbitrary potentials in a phase space. We present general conditions on the
potential in order to obtain the stability of standard 4D and non-standard 5D
de Sitter solutions, and we provide the stability conditions for both scalar
field-matter scaling solutions, scalar field-dark radiation solutions and
scalar field-dominated solutions. We find that the shear-dominated solutions
are unstable (particularly, contracting shear-dominated solutions are of saddle
type). As a main difference with our previous work, the traditionally
ever-expanding models could potentially re-collapse due to the negativity of
the dark radiation. Additionally, our system admits a large class of static
solutions that are of saddle type. These kinds of solutions are important at
intermediate stages in the evolution of the universe, since they allow the
transition from contracting to expanding models and viceversa. New features of
our scenario are the existence of a bounce and a turnaround, which lead to
cyclic behavior, that are not allowed in Bianchi I branes with positive dark
radiation term. Finally, as specific examples we consider the potentials
$V\propto\sinh^{-\alpha}(\beta\phi)$ and $V\propto\left[\cosh\left(\xi\phi
\right)-1\right]$ which have simple $f$-devisers.

Global fits to world neutrino data suggest two nearly degenerate solutions for
theta23: one in the lower octant (LO: theta23 < 45 degree) and the other in the
higher octant (HO: theta23 > 45 degree). numu to nue oscillations in superbeam
experiments are sensitive to the octant and are capable of resolving this
degeneracy. We study the prospects of this resolution by the current T2K and
upcoming NOvA experiments. Because of the hierarchy-deltacp degeneracy and the
octant-deltacp degeneracy, the impact of hierarchy on octant resolution has to
be taken into account. As in the case of hierarchy determination, there exist
favorable (unfavorable) values of deltacp for which octant resolution is easy
(challenging). However, for octant resolution the unfavorable deltacp values of
the neutrino data are favorable for the anti-neutrino data and vice-verse. This
is in contrast to the case of hierarchy determination. In this paper, we
compute the combined sensitivity of T2K and NOvA to resolve the octant
ambiguity. If sin^2\theta23 =0.41, then NOvA can rule out all the values of
theta23 in HO at 2 sigma C.L., irrespective of the hierarchy and deltacp.
Addition of T2K data improves the octant sensitivity. If T2K were to have equal
neutrino and anti-neutrino runs of 2.5 years each, a 2 sigma resolution of the
octant becomes possible provided sin^2\theta23 \leq 0.43 or \geq 0.58 for any

higher order terms in this expansion which is accurate enough for current
experimental sensitivity levels has been developed in Hanson et. al. (2010), as
well as a slightly modified Okamoto and Hu quadratic estimator which
incorporates lensed rather than unlensed spectra into the estimator weights to
mitigate the effect of higher order terms. We extend these results in several
ways: (1) We generalize this analysis to the full set of quadratic
temperature/polarization lensing estimators, (2) We study the effect of higher
order terms for more futuristic experimental noise levels, (3) We show that the
ability of the modified quadratic estimator to mitigate the effect of higher

lensed spectra are known. We investigate the sensitivity of this cancellation
to uncertainties in or knowledge of these spectra. We find that higher order
terms in the Taylor expansion can impact projected error bars at experimental
sensitivities similar to those found in future ACTpol/SPTpol experiments.

emitting gas could have played a key role in quenching their star-formation
history. Yet, it is still unclear what drives the precise amount of hot gas
around these galaxies. By combining photometric and spectroscopic measurements
for the early-type galaxies observed during the Atlas3D integral-field survey
with measurements of their X-ray luminosity based on X-ray data of both low and
high spatial resolution we conclude that the hot-gas content of early-type
galaxies can depend on their dynamical structure. Specifically, whereas slow
rotators generally have X-ray halos with luminosity L_X,gas and temperature T
values that are in line with what is expected if the hot-gas emission is
sustained by the thermalisaton of the kinetic energy carried by the
stellar-mass loss material, fast rotators tend to display L_X,gas values that
fall consistently below the prediction of this model, with similar T values
that do not scale with the stellar kinetic energy as observed in the case of
slow rotators. Considering that fast rotators are likely to be intrinsically
flatter than slow rotators, and that the few L_X,gas-deficient slow rotators
also happen to be relatively flat, the observed L_X,gas deficiency in these
objects would support the hypothesis whereby flatter galaxies have a harder
time in retaining their hot gas. We discuss the implications that a different
hot-gas content could have on the fate of both acquired and internally-produced
gaseous material, considering in particular how the L_X,gas deficiency of fast
rotators would make them more capable to recycle the stellar-mass loss material
into new stars than slow rotators. This is consistent with the finding that

should be minimized to allow two path interference, since the coherence length
of the quasiparticles in the correlated states are expected be limited, yet a
small device promotes the dominance of Coulomb charging effects which would
overwhelm the Aharonov-Bohm interference effect. In this study a series of
small but different size interferometers from the same high density
heterostructure wafer are examined for the presence of Coulomb effects versus
Aharonov-Bohm (A-B) interference effect when operated in gate configurations
that support the 5/2, 7/3, and 8/3 fractional quantum Hall effects. The device
sizes vary by more than a factor of three, and over this range explicitly show
specific properties of A-B interference, but not Coulomb dominated effects.
Given these A-B interference results, the coherence length of the charge e/4
interference is extracted. The coherence length of non-Abelian e/4
quasiparticles is an important parameter for design and development of complex
interference devices used to study and apply this exotic excitation. As in
prior observations of e/4 excitations, A-B e/4 and e/2 oscillations in
alternation are observed in these multiple devices. The amplitudes of the e/4
oscillations are observed to be dramatically reduced for larger area
interferometers. Path-length limits are derived from interferometer areas
determined directly by A-B measurements, and the attenuation lengths of the e/4
oscillations are shown to be micron to sub-micron scale. This coherence length
is consistent with that of the 7/3 excitations measured here, and consistent

Toomre Q>>1, the disk is stable against fragmentation into self-gravitating
objects (and so cannot form planets via direct collapse). But if disks are
turbulent, this neglects a spectrum of stochastic density fluctuations that can
produce rare, high-density mass concentrations. Here, we use a
recently-developed analytic framework to predict the statistics of these
fluctuations, i.e. the rate of fragmentation and mass spectrum of fragments
formed in a turbulent Keplerian disk. Turbulent disks are never completely
stable: we calculate the (always finite) probability of forming
self-gravitating structures via stochastic turbulent density fluctuations in
such disks. Modest sub-sonic turbulence above Mach number ~0.1 can produce a
few stochastic fragmentation or 'direct collapse' events over ~Myr timescales,
even if Q>>1 and cooling is slow (t_cool>>t_orbit). In trans-sonic turbulence
this extends to Q~100. We derive the true Q-criterion needed to suppress such
events, which scales exponentially with Mach number. We specify to turbulence
driven by MRI, convection, or spiral waves, and derive equivalent criteria in
terms of Q and the cooling time. Cooling times >~50*t_dyn may be required to
completely suppress fragmentation. These gravoturbulent events produce mass
spectra peaked near ~M_disk*(Q*M_disk/M_star)^2 (rocky-to-giant planet masses,
increasing with distance from the star). We apply this to protoplanetary disk
models and show that even minimum mass solar nebulae could experience
stochastic collapse events, provided a source of turbulence.

offsets are a suggested measure of the star formation timescale after the
compression of gas at spiral arm entry. A surprising discrepancy, by an order
of magnitude, has been reported in recent offset measurements in nearby spiral
galaxies. Measurements using CO and H-alpha emission find large and ordered
offsets in M51. On the contrary, small or non-ordered offsets have been found
using the HI 21cm and 24 micron emissions, possible evidence against gas flow
through spiral arms, and thus against the conventional density-wave theory with
a stationary spiral pattern. The goal of this paper is to understand the cause
of this discrepancy. We investigate potential causes by repeating those
previous measurements using equivalent data, methods, and parameters. We find
offsets consistent with the previous measurements and conclude that the
difference of gas tracers, i.e., HI versus CO, is the primary cause. The HI
emission is contaminated significantly by the gas photo-dissociated by
recently-formed stars and does not necessarily trace the compressed gas, the
precursor of star formation. The HI gas and star forming regions coincide
spatially and tend to show small offsets. We find mostly positive offsets with
substantial scatter between CO and H-alpha, suggesting gas flow through spiral
arms (i.e., density-wave) though the spiral pattern may not necessarily be
stationary.

the Milky Way halo mass can be derived using the properties of the satellites
similar to the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC). However, it
would be straightforward to interpret such an estimate only if the properties
of the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) are fairly typical and are not biased by the
environment. In this study we explore whether the environment of the Milky Way
affects the properties of the SMC and LMC such as their velocities. To test for
the effect of the environment, we compare velocity distributions for MC-sized
subhalos around Milky Way hosts in a sample selected simply by mass and in the
second sample of such halos selected with additional restrictions on the
distance to the nearest cluster and the local galaxy density, designed to mimic
the environment of the Local Group (LG). We find that satellites in halos in
the LG-like environments do have somewhat larger velocities, as compared to the
halos of similar mass in the sample without environmental constraints. We
derive the host halo likelihood distribution for the samples in the LG-like
envirionment and in the control sample and find that the environment does not
significantly affect the derived likelihood. We use the updated properties of
the SMC and LMC to derive the constraint on the MW halo mass $\log{({\rm
M}_{200} /\msol)}=12.06^{+0.31}_{-0.19}$ (90% confidence interval). We also
explore the incidence of close pairs with relative velocities and separations
similar to those of the LMC and SMC and find that such pairs are quite rare
among $\Lambda$CDM halos. Taking into account the close separation of the MCs
in the Busha et al.\ 2011 method results in the shift of the MW halo mass

divided into two basic categories - those capable of representing correlations

the scaling of the accuracy of gapped systems in the latter case and analyze
the resultant spatial anisotropy. It is apparent that particular points in the
system, that are somehow `central' in the renormalization, have local

balance between exploration and exploitation when learning to optimize actions
such as in multi-armed bandit problems. The algorithm, also known as Thompson
Sampling, offers significant advantages over the popular upper confidence bound
(UCB) approach, and can be applied to problems with finite or infinite action
spaces and complicated relationships among action rewards. We make two
theoretical contributions. The first establishes a connection between posterior
sampling and UCB algorithms. This result lets us convert regret bounds
developed for UCB algorithms into Bayesian regret bounds for posterior
sampling. Our second theoretical contribution is a Bayesian regret bound for
posterior sampling that applies broadly and can be specialized to many model
classes. This bound depends on a new notion we refer to as the eluder
dimension, which measures the degree of dependence among action rewards.
Compared to UCB algorithm Bayesian regret bounds for specific model classes,
our general bound matches the best available for linear models and is stronger
than the best available for generalized linear models. Further, our analysis
provides insight into performance advantages of posterior sampling, which are
highlighted through simulation results that demonstrate performance surpassing
recently proposed UCB algorithms.

characterized by the joining and subsequent tearing apart of sister chromatids.
When this process is repeated during multiple rounds of cell division, it leads
to patterns of copy number increases of chromosomal segments as well as
fold-back inversions where duplicated segments are arranged head-to-head. These
structural variations can then drive tumorigenesis.
  BFB can be observed in progress using cytogenetic techniques, but generally
BFB must be inferred from data like microarrays or sequencing collected after
BFB has ceased. Making correct inferences from this data is not
straightforward, particularly given the complexity of some cancer genomes and
BFB's ability to generate a wide range of rearrangement patterns.
  Here we present algorithms to aid the interpretation of evidence for BFB. We
first pose the BFB count vector problem: given a chromosome segmentation and
segment copy numbers, decide whether BFB can yield a chromosome with the given
segment counts. We present the first linear-time algorithm for the problem,
improving a previous exponential-time algorithm. We then combine this algorithm
with fold-back inversions to develop tests for BFB. We show that, contingent on
assumptions about cancer genome evolution, count vectors and fold-back
inversions are sufficient evidence for detecting BFB. We apply the presented
techniques to paired-end sequencing data from pancreatic tumors and confirm a
previous finding of BFB as well as identify a new chromosomal region likely
rearranged by BFB cycles, demonstrating the practicality of our approach.

complexity, both in terms of the biomedical ingredients and the mathematical
description. The simplest ones contain competition for space using purely fluid
mechanical concepts. Another possible ingredient is the supply of nutrients
through vasculature. The models can describe the tissue either at the level of
cell densities, or at the scale of the solid tumor, in this latter case by
means of a free boundary problem.
  Our first goal here is to formulate a free boundary model of Hele-Shaw type,
a variant including growth terms, starting from the description at the cell
level and passing to a certain limit. A detailed mathematical analysis of this
purely mechanical model is performed. Indeed, we are able to prove strong
convergence in passing to the limit, with various uniform gradient estimates;
we also prove uniqueness for the asymptotic Hele-Shaw type problem. The main
tools are nonlinear regularizing effects for certain porous medium type
equations, regularization techniques \`a la Steklov, and a Hilbert duality
method for uniqueness. At variance with the classical Hele-Shaw problem, here
the geometric motion governed by the pressure is not sufficient to completely
describe the dynamics. A complete description requires the equation on the cell
number density.
  Using this theory as a basis, we go on to consider the more complex model
including nutrients. We obtain the equation for the limit of the coupled
system; the method relies on some BV bounds and space/time a priori estimates.
Here, new technical difficulties appear, and they reduce the generality of the
results in terms of the initial data. Finally, we prove uniqueness for the

crucial role of the cluster mechanical power and of the strong time evolution
of the ionizing photon flux and of the bolometric luminosity of the exciting
cluster is stressed. It is shown that radiation has only a narrow window of
opportunity to dominate the wind-driven shell dynamics. This may occur only at
early stages of the bubble evolution and if the shell expands into a dusty
and/or a very dense proto-cluster medium. The impact of radiation pressure on
the wind-driven shell becomes always negligible after about 3 Myr. Finally, the
wind-driven model results allow one to compare the model predictions with the
distribution of thermal pressure derived from X-ray observations. The shape of
the thermal pressure profile allows then to distinguish between the energy and
the momentum dominated regimes of expansion and thus conclude whether radiative
losses of energy or the leakage of hot gas from the bubble interior have been
significant during the bubble evolution.

circumnuclear rings, that form an effective reservoir for massive star
formation and thus shape the central regions of galaxies. However, how exactly
star formation is proceeding within these circumnuclear starburst rings is
subject of debate. Two main scenarios for this process have been put forward:
In the first the onset of star formation is regulated by the total amount of
gas present in the ring with star forming starting once a mass threshold has
reached in a `random' position within the ring like `popcorn'. In the second
star formation preferentially takes place near the locations where the gas
enters the ring. This scenario has been dubbed `pearls-on-a-string'. Here we
combine new optical IFU data covering the full stellar bar with existing
multi-wavelength data to study in detail the 580 pc radius circumnuclear
starburst ring in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 6951. Using HST archival data
together with Sauron and Oasis IFU data, we derive the ages and stellar masses
of star clusters as well as the total stellar content of the central region.
Adding information on the molecular gas distribution, stellar and gaseous
dynamics and extinction, we find that the circumnuclear ring in NGC 6951 is
~1-1.5 Gyr old and has been forming stars for most of that time. We see
evidence for preferred sites of star formation within the ring, consistent with
the `pearls-on-a-string' scenario, when focusing on the youngest stellar
populations. Due to the ring's longevity this signature is washed out when
older stellar populations are included in the analysis.

Relativity are used to search for these sources, and will probably be used to
extract source parameters from detected signals. However, if a different theory
of gravity happens to be correct in the strong-field regime, source-parameter
estimation may be affected by a fundamental bias: that is, by systematic errors
induced due to the use of waveforms derived in the incorrect theory. If the
deviations from General Relativity are not large enough to be detectable on
their own and yet these systematic errors remain significant (i.e., larger than
the statistical uncertainties in parameter estimation), fundamental bias cannot
be corrected in a single observation, and becomes stealth bias. In this article
we develop a scheme to determine in which cases stealth bias could be present
in gravitational-wave astronomy. For a given observation, the answer depends on
the detection signal-to-noise ratio and on the strength of the modified-gravity
correction. As an example, we study three representative stellar-mass binary
systems that will be detectable with second-generation ground-based
observatories. We find that significant systematic bias can occur whether or
not modified gravity can be positively detected, for correction strengths that
are not currently excluded by any other experiment. Thus, stealth bias may be a
generic feature of gravitational-wave detections, and it should be considered

the identification and labeling of the stratigraphic components in the

augmented subspace to extract candidate solutions for all the shifted systems.
The ideal method would use the same augmented subspace for all systems and have
fixed storage requirements, independent of the number of shifted systems per
family. We show that a method satisfying both requirements cannot exist in this
framework.
  As an alternative, we introduce two schemes. One constructs a separate
deflation space for each shifted system but solves each family of shifted
systems simultaneously. The other builds only one recycled subspace and
constructs approximate corrections to the solutions of the shifted systems at
each cycle of the iterative linear solver while only minimizing the base system
residual. At convergence of the base system solution, we apply the method
recursively to the remaining unconverged systems. We present numerical examples
involving systems arising in lattice quantum chromodynamics.

majority of active galactic nuclei (AGN) at z ~ 1-3 are resident in isolated
disk galaxies, contrary to the usual expectation that AGN are triggered by
mergers. Here we develop a new test of the cosmic evolution of supermassive
black holes (SMBHs) in disk galaxies by considering the local population of
SMBHs. We show that substantial SMBH growth in spiral galaxies is required as
disks assemble. SMBHs exhibit a tight relation between their mass and the
velocity dispersion of the spheroid within which they reside, the M_BH-sigma
relation. In disk galaxies the bulge is the spheroid of interest. We explore
the evolution of the M_BH-sigma relation when bulges form together with SMBHs
on the M_BH-sigma relation and then slowly reform a disk around them. The
formation of the disk compresses the bulge raising its sigma. We present
evidence for such compression in the form of larger velocity dispersion of
classical bulges compared with elliptical galaxies at the same mass. This
compression leads to an offset in the M_BH-sigma relation if it is not
accompanied by an increased M_BH. We quantify the expected offset based on
photometric data and show that, on average, SMBHs must grow by ~ 50-65% just to
remain on the M_BH-sigma relation. We find no significant offset in the
M_BH-sigma relations of classical bulges and of ellipticals, implying that
SMBHs have been growing along with disks. Our simulations demonstrate that SMBH
growth is necessary for the local population of disk galaxies to have remained
on the M_BH-sigma relation.

an `intermediate-axis orientation'. We do this with three models. In the first
two cases we simply rigidly grow a disc in a triaxial halo such that the disc
ends up perpendicular to the global intermediate axis. We also attempt to coax
a disc to form in an intermediate-axis orientation by producing a gas+dark
matter triaxial system with gas angular momentum about the intermediate axis.
In all cases we fail to produce systems which remain with stellar angular
momentum aligned with the halo's intermediate axis, even when the disc's
potential flattens the inner halo such that the disc is everywhere
perpendicular to the halo's local minor axis. For one of these unstable
simulations we show that the potential is even rounder than the models of the
Milky Way potential in the region probed by the Sagittarius Stream. We conclude
that the Milky Way's disc is very unlikely to be in an intermediate axis
orientation. However we find that a disc can persist off one of the principal

business processes described in terms of interacting modules called artifacts.
Artifacts consist of data and lifecycles, accounting respectively for the
relational structure of the artifacts' states and their possible evolutions
over time. In this paper we put forward artifact-centric multi-agent systems, a
novel formalisation of artifact systems in the context of multi-agent systems
operating on them. Differently from the usual process-based models of services,
the semantics we give explicitly accounts for the data structures on which
artifact systems are defined. We study the model checking problem for
artifact-centric multi-agent systems against specifications written in a
quantified version of temporal-epistemic logic expressing the knowledge of the
agents in the exchange. We begin by noting that the problem is undecidable in
general. We then identify two noteworthy restrictions, one syntactical and one
semantical, that enable us to find bisimilar finite abstractions and therefore
reduce the model checking problem to the instance on finite models. Under these
assumptions we show that the model checking problem for these systems is
EXPSPACE-complete. We then introduce artifact-centric programs, compact and
declarative representations of the programs governing both the artifact system
and the agents. We show that, while these in principle generate infinite-state
systems, under natural conditions their verification problem can be solved on
finite abstractions that can be effectively computed from the programs. Finally
we exemplify the theoretical results of the paper through a mainstream

simulations we can study the properties of galaxies with stellar masses greater
than $10^{8}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}\,h^{-1}$ and (co-moving) number densities of
$\log_{10}(\phi\, [{\rm Mpc^{-3}\,dex^{-1}}\,h^{3}])>-8$. Observational
determinations of the galaxy stellar mass function at very-high redshift
typically assume a relation between the observed UV luminosity and stellar
mass-to-light ratio which is applied to high-redshift samples in order to
estimate stellar masses. This relation can also be measured from the
simulations. We do this, finding two significant differences with the usual
observational assumption: it evolves strongly with redshift and has a different
shape. Using this relation to make a consistent comparison between galaxy
stellar mass functions we find that at $z=6$ and above the simulation
predictions are in good agreement with observed data over the whole mass range.
Without using the correct UV luminosity and stellar mass-to-light ratio, the
discrepancy would be up to two orders of magnitude for large galaxies
$>10^{10}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}\,h^{-1}$. At $z=5$, however the stellar mass
function for low mass $<10^{9}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}\,h^{-1}$ galaxies is
overpredicted by factors of a few, consistent with the behaviour of the UV
luminosity function, and perhaps a sign that feedback in the simulation is not
efficient enough for these galaxies.

T has been extended to a function of T. The $f(T)$ modified teleparallel
gravity has been proposed as the natural gravitational alternative for dark
energy to explain the late time acceleration of the universe. In order to
reconstruct the function $f(T)$ by demanding a background $\Lambda$CDM
cosmology we assume that, (i) the background cosmic history provided by the
flat $\Lambda$CDM (the radiation ere with $\omega_{eff}=1/3$, matter and de
Sitter eras with $\omega_{eff}=0$ and $\omega_{eff}=-1$, respectively) (ii) the
radiation dominate in the radiation era with $\Omega_{0r}=1$ and the matter
dominate during the matter phases when $\Omega_{0m}=1$. We find the
cosmological dynamical system which can obey the $\Lambda$CDM cosmic history.
In each era, we find a critical lines that, the radiation dominated and the
matter dominated are one points of them in the radiation and matter phases,
respectively. Also, we drive the cosmologically viability condition for these
models. We investigate the stability condition with respect to the homogeneous
scalar perturbations in each era and we obtain the stability conditions for the
fixed points in each eras. Finally, we reconstruct the function $f(T)$ which
mimics cosmic expansion history.

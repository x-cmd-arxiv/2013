leaves using several techniques: geometric, formal and analytic ones. One of
the main results (Theorem 2) is a normal form theorem in Poisson geometry,
which is the Poisson-geometric version of the Local Reeb Stability (from
foliation theory) and of the Slice Theorem (from equivariant geometry). The
result generalizes Conn's theorem from fixed points to arbitrary symplectic
leaves. We present two proofs of this result: a geometric one relying heavily
on the theory of Lie algebroids and Lie groupoids (similar to the new proof of
Conn's theorem by Crainic and Fernandes), and an analytic one using the
Nash-Moser fast convergence method (more in the spirit of Conn's original
proof). The analytic approach gives much more, we prove a local rigidity result
(Theorem 4) around compact Poisson submanifolds, which is the first of this
kind in Poisson geometry. Theorem 4 has a surprising application to the study
of smooth deformation of Poisson structures: in Theorem 5 we compute the
Poisson-moduli space around the Lie-Poisson sphere (i.e. the invariant unit
sphere inside the linear Poisson manifold corresponding to a compact semisimple
Lie algebra). This is the first such computation of a Poisson moduli space in
dimension greater or equal to 3 around a degenerate (i.e. non-symplectic)
Poisson structure. Other results presented in the thesis are: a new proof to
the existence of symplectic realizations (Theorem 0), a normal form theorem for
symplectic foliations (Theorem 1), a formal normal form/rigidity result around
Poisson submanifolds (Theorem 3), and a general construction of tame homotopy
operators for Lie algebroid cohomology (the Tame Vanishing Lemma). We also
revisit Conn's theorem and a theorem of Hamilton on rigidity of foliations.

goal of understanding the effects of magnetic field on the BL. We use
cylindrical coordinates with an isothermal equation of state and investigate a
number of initial field geometries including toroidal, vertical, and vertical
with zero net flux. Our initial setup consists of a Keplerian disk attached to
a non-rotating star. In a previous work, we found that in hydrodynamical
simulations, sound waves excited by shear in the BL were able to efficiently
transport angular momentum and drive mass accretion onto the star. Here we
confirm that in MHD simulations, waves serve as an efficient means of angular
momentum transport in the vicinity of the BL, despite the magnetorotational
instability (MRI) operating in the disk. In particular, the angular momentum
current due to waves is at times larger than the angular momentum current due
to MRI. Our results suggest that angular momentum transport in the BL and its
vicinity is a global phenomenon occurring through dissipation of waves and
shocks. This point of view is quite different from the standard picture of
transport by a local anomalous turbulent viscosity. In addition to angular
momentum transport, we also study magnetic field amplification within the BL.
We find that the field is indeed amplified in the BL, but only by a factor of a
few and remains subthermal.

structure has challenged the conventional symmetric nearly-tetrahedral model
and initiated an intense debate about the order and symmetry of the hydrogen
bond network in water. Here, we present new insights into the nature of local
interactions in water obtained using a novel energy decomposition method. Our
simulations reveal that while a water molecule forms, on average, two strong
donor and two strong acceptor bonds, there is a significant asymmetry in the
energy of these contacts. We demonstrate that this asymmetry is a result of
small instantaneous distortions of hydrogen bonds, which appear as fluctuations
on a timescale of hundreds of femtoseconds around the average symmetric
structure. Furthermore, we show that the distinct features of the X-ray
absorption spectra originate from molecules with high instantaneous asymmetry.
Our findings have important implications as they help reconcile the symmetric
and asymmetric views on the structure of water.

branched covers of the projective line over \bar Q. The first main result
states that every mere cover model has a unique minimal field of definition
where its automorphisms are defined, and goes on to describe special properties
of this field. One corollary of this result is that for every G-Galois branched
cover there is a field of definition which is Galois over its field of moduli,
with Galois group a subgroup of Aut(G). The second main theorem states that the
field resulting by adjoining to the field of moduli all of the roots of unity
whose order divides some power of |Z(G)| is a field of definition. By combining
this result with results from an earlier paper, I prove corollaries related to
the Inverse Galois Problem. For example, it allows me to prove that for every
finite group G, there is an extension of number fields Q \subset E \subset F
such that F/E is G-Galois, and E/Q ramifies only over those primes that divide
|G|. I.e., G is realizable over a field that is ""close"" to Q.

precision. They may well find the ratio of pressure to energy density, $w$, is
-1, meaning DE is equivalent to a cosmological constant. However, many
time-varying DE models have also been proposed. A single parametrization to
test a broad class of them and that is itself motivated by a physical picture
is therefore desirable. We suggest the simplest model of DE has the same
mechanism as inflation, likely a scalar field slowly rolling down its
potential. If this is so, DE will have a generic equation of state and the
Universe will have a generic dependence of the Hubble constant on redshift
independent of the potential's starting value and shape. This equation of state
and expression for the Hubble constant offer the desired model-independent but
physically motivated parametrization, because they will hold for most of the
standard scalar-field models of DE such as quintessence and phantom DE. Up
until now two-parameter descriptions of $w$ have been available, but this work
finds an additional approximation that leads to a single-parameter model. Using
it, we conduct a $\chi^2$ analysis and find that experiments in the next seven
years should be able to distinguish any of these time-varying DE models on the
one hand from a cosmological constant on the other to 73% confidence if $w$
today differs from -1 by 3.5%. In the limit of perfectly accurate measurements
of $\Omega_m$ and $H_0$, this confidence would rise to 96%. We also include

contrast to topologically trivial Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer \textit{s}-wave
superfluid, topological superfluid can host a mid-gap state that is bound to
localized non-magnetic impurity. For strong impurity scattering, the bound
state becomes universal, with nearly zero energy and a wave-function that
closely follows the symmetry of that of Majorana fermions. We propose that the
observation of such a universal bound state could be a useful evidence for
characterizing the topolgoical nature of topological superfluids. Our

present a least-update-complexity encoding scheme for MBR codes. A decoding
scheme is proposed that utilizes the $[n,\alpha]$ RS code to perform data

recent analysis of multi-wavelength spectral and image data suggests that the
Unified Model is only a partial theory of AGN, and may need to be augmented to
remain consistent with all observations. Recent studies using high spatial
resolution ground- and space-based observations of local AGN show that Seyfert
class and the ""core"" (r<~1 kpc) host-galaxy morphology are correlated.
Currently, this relationship has only been established qualitatively, by visual
inspection of the core morphologies of low redshift (z<0.035) Seyfert host
galaxies (Malkan et al. 1998). We re-establish this empirical relationship in
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) optical imaging by visual inspection of a catalog
of 85 local (D<63 Mpc) Seyfert galaxies. We also attempt to re-establish the
core morphology-Seyfert class relationship using an automated, non-parametric
technique that combines both existing classification parameters methods (the
adapted CAS, G-M20), and a new method which implements the Source Extractor
software for feature detection in unsharp-mask images. This new method is
designed explicitly to detect dust features in the images. We use our automated
approach to classify the morphology of the AGN cores and determine that Sy2
galaxies visually appear, on average, to have more dust features than Sy1. With
the exception of this ""dustiness"" however, we do not measure a strong
correlation between the dust morphology and the Seyfert class of the host
galaxy using quantitative techniques. We discuss the implications of these
results in the context of the Unified Model.

Central to these methods is the lattice simulation of quarks in uniform,

polarizabilities directly from lattice computations, however, in the near term,
one may need to rely on partially quenched chiral perturbation theory.
Nonetheless the same striking predictions for the pion mass dependence of

  Systems","14",,"10.1109/TSP.2013.2245124",,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work examines the use of two-way training to efficiently discriminate
the channel estimation performances at a legitimate receiver (LR) and an
unauthorized receiver (UR) in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless
system. This work improves upon the original discriminatory channel estimation
(DCE) scheme proposed by Chang et al where multiple stages of feedback and
retraining were used. While most studies on physical layer secrecy are under
the information-theoretic framework and focus directly on the data transmission
phase, studies on DCE focus on the training phase and aim to provide a
practical signal processing technique to discriminate between the channel
estimation performances at LR and UR. A key feature of DCE designs is the
insertion of artificial noise (AN) in the training signal to degrade the
channel estimation performance at UR. To do so, AN must be placed in a
carefully chosen subspace based on the transmitter's knowledge of LR's channel
in order to minimize its effect on LR. In this paper, we adopt the idea of
two-way training that allows both the transmitter and LR to send training
signals to facilitate channel estimation at both ends. Both reciprocal and
non-reciprocal channels are considered and a two-way DCE scheme is proposed for
each scenario. {For mathematical tractability, we assume that all terminals
employ the linear minimum mean square error criterion for channel estimation.
Based on the mean square error (MSE) of the channel estimates at all
terminals,} we formulate and solve an optimization problem where the optimal
power allocation between the training signal and AN is found by minimizing the
MSE of LR's channel estimate subject to a constraint on the MSE achievable at
UR. Numerical results show that the proposed DCE schemes can effectively
discriminate between the channel estimation and hence the data detection
performances at LR and UR.

formulate a unified solution to the underlying estimation problem. In robust
Bayesian analysis, a frequent criticism is that the optimal estimators are not
invariant under smooth reparameterizations. This paper considers the problem of
posterior regret gamma-minimax (PRGM) estimation of the natural parameter of
the exponential family of distributions under intrinsic loss functions. We show
that under the class of Jeffrey's Conjugate Prior (JCP) distributions, PRGM
estimators are invariant to smooth one-to-one reparameterizations. We apply our
results to several distributions and different classes of JCP, as well as the
usual conjugate prior distributions. We observe that, in many cases, invariant
PRGM estimators in the class of JCP distributions can be obtained by some
modifications of PRGM estimators in the usual class of conjugate priors.
  Moreover, when the class of priors are convex or dependant on a
hyper-parameter belonging to a connected set, we show that the PRGM estimator
under the intrinsic loss function could be Bayes with respect to a prior
distribution in the original prior class. Theoretical results are supplemented
with several examples and illustrations.

evolution, and hence the definition of such metrics is an interesting problem
in phylogenetics. In a paper in Taxon fifty years ago, Sokal and Rohlf proposed
to measure quantitatively the difference between a pair of phylogenetic trees
by first encoding them by means of their half-matrices of cophenetic values,
and then comparing these matrices. This idea has been used several times since
then to define dissimilarity measures between phylogenetic trees but, to our
knowledge, no proper metric on weighted phylogenetic trees with nested taxa
based on this idea has been formally defined and studied yet. Actually, the
cophenetic values of pairs of different taxa alone are not enough to single out
phylogenetic trees with weighted arcs or nested taxa. In this paper we define a
family of cophenetic metrics that compare phylogenetic trees on a same set of
taxa by encoding them by means of their vectors of cophenetic values of pairs
of taxa and depths of single taxa, and then computing the $L^p$ norm of the
difference of the corresponding vectors. Then, we study, either analytically or
numerically, some of their basic properties: neighbors, diameter, distribution,
and their rank correlation with each other and with other metrics.

first one is a lower exponential bound for Gabidulin codes and shows that for

Second, an exponential upper bound is derived, which holds for any rank-metric

there exists a rank-metric code over $\Fqm$ of length $n \leq m$ such that the
list size is exponential in the length for any radius greater than half the

Our goal was to monitor the activity of Sgr A* at different wavelengths in
order to constrain the emitting processes and gain insight into the nature of
the close environment of Sgr A*. Methods. We used the MIR instrument VISIR in
the BURST imaging mode, the adaptive optics assisted NIR camera NACO, and the
sub-mm antenna APEX to monitor Sgr A* over several nights in July 2007.
Results. The observations reveal remarkable variability in the NIR and sub-mm
during the five nights of observation. No source was detected in the MIR, but
we derived the lowest upper limit for a flare at 8.59 microns (22.4 mJy with
A_8.59mu = 1.6+/- 0.5). This observational constraint makes us discard the
observed NIR emission as coming from a thermal component emitting at sub-mm
frequencies. Moreover, comparison of the sub-mm and NIR variability shows that
the highest NIR fluxes (flares) are coincident with the lowest sub-mm levels of
our five-night campaign involving three flares. We explain this behavior by a
loss of electrons to the system and/or by a decrease in the magnetic field, as
might conceivably occur in scenarios involving fast outflows and/or magnetic
reconnection.

relaying scenario was studied in [1], [3], [4] and [5]. In [7] it was shown
that every network coding map that satisfies the exclusive law is representable
by a Latin Square and conversely, and this relationship can be used to get the
network coding maps satisfying the exclusive law. But, only the scenario in
which the end nodes use $M$-PSK signal sets is addressed in [7] and [8]. In
this paper, we address the case in which the end nodes use $M$-QAM signal sets.
In a fading scenario, for certain channel conditions $\gamma e^{j \theta}$,
termed singular fade states, the MA phase performance is greatly reduced. By
formulating a procedure for finding the exact number of singular fade states
for QAM, we show that square QAM signal sets give lesser number of singular
fade states compared to PSK signal sets. This results in superior performance
of $M$-QAM over $M$-PSK. It is shown that the criterion for partitioning the
complex plane, for the purpose of using a particular network code for a
particular fade state, is different from that used for $M$-PSK. Using a
modified criterion, we describe a procedure to analytically partition the
complex plane representing the channel condition. We show that when $M$-QAM ($M
>4$) signal set is used, the conventional XOR network mapping fails to remove
the ill effects of $\gamma e^{j \theta}=1$, which is a singular fade state for
all signal sets of arbitrary size. We show that a doubly block circulant Latin
Square removes this singular fade state for $M$-QAM.

When non-Gaussianity appears, it is sign of uncertainty and phase transition,
which could be sign of existence of petroleum reservoirs. Two important
parameters which describe a system at any scale are determined; the
non-Gaussian degree, $q$, announced in entropy and the intermittency,
$\lambda^2$, which explains a critical behavior in the system. There exist some
petrophysical indicators in order to characterize a reservoir, but there is
vacancy to measure scaling information contain in comparison with together,
yet. In this article, we compare the non-Gaussianity in three selected
indicators in various scales. The quantities investigated in this article
includes Gamma emission (GR), sonic transient time (DT) and Neutron porosity
(NPHI). It is observed that GR has a fat tailed PDF at all scales which is a
sign of phase transition in the system which indicates high $q$ and
$\lambda^2$. This results in the availability of valuable information about
this quantity. NPHI displays a scale dependence of PDF which converges to a
Gaussian at large scales. This is a sign of a separated and uncorrelated
porosity at large scales. For the DT series, small $\lambda^2$ and $q$ at all
scales are a hallmark of local correlations in this quantity.

regression, we propose a regularised version of PCA that boils down to
threshold the singular values. Each singular value is multiplied by a term
which can be seen as the ratio of the signal variance over the total variance
of the associated dimension. The regularised term is analytically derived using
asymptotic results and can also be justified from a Bayesian treatment of the
model. Regularised PCA provides promising results in terms of the recovery of
the true signal and the graphical outputs in comparison with classical PCA and
with a soft thresholding estimation strategy. The gap between PCA and
regularised PCA is all the more important that data are noisy.

in the convection zone, whose property is fundamentally important for
determining the coronal structure and solar activity when emerged. However, our
knowledge on the detailed 3-D structure prior to its emergence is rather poor,
largely limited by the low cadence and sensitivity of previous instruments.
Here, using the 45-second high-cadence observations from the Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager (\emph{HMI}) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(\emph{SDO}), we are able for the first time to reconstruct a 3-D datacube and
infer the detailed subsurface magnetic structure of NOAA AR 11158 and to
characterize its magnetic connectivity and topology. This task is accomplished
with the aid of the image-stacking method and advanced 3-D visualization. We
find that the AR consists of two major bipoles, or four major polarities. Each
polarity in 3-D shows interesting tree-like structure, i.e. while the root of
the polarity appears as a single tree-trunk-like tube, the top of the polarity
has multiple branches consisting of smaller and thinner flux-tubes which
connect to the branches of the opposite polarity that is similarly fragmented.
The roots of the four polarities align well along a straight line, while the
top branches are slightly non-coplanar. Our observations suggest that an active
region, even appearing highly complicated on the surface, may originate from a
simple straight flux-tube that undergoes both horizontal and vertical
bifurcation processes during its rise through the convection zone.

been confined to certain mass or luminosity boundaries because most studies
focus only on low-, intermediate- or high-mass star-forming regions. As part of
the ""Water In Star-forming regions with Herschel"" (WISH) key program, water and
other important molecules, such as CO and OH, have been observed in 51 embedded
young stellar objects (YSOs). The studied sample covers a range of luminosities
from <1 to >10^5 L_sol. Aims; We analyse the CO line emission towards a large
sample of protostars in terms of both line intensities and profiles. Methods;
Herschel-HIFI spectra of the 12CO 10-9, 13CO 10-9 and C18O 5-4, 9-8 and 10-9
lines are analysed for a sample of 51 YSOs. In addition, JCMT spectra of 12CO
3-2 and C18O 3-2 extend this analysis to cooler gas components. Results; All
observed CO and isotopologue spectra show a strong linear correlation between
the logarithms of the line and bolometric luminosities across six orders of
magnitude on both axes. This suggests that the high-J CO lines primarily trace
the amount of dense gas associated with YSOs. This relation can be extended to
larger (extragalactic) scales. The majority of the detected 12CO line profiles
can be decomposed into a broad and a narrow Gaussian component, while the C18O
spectra are mainly fitted with a single Gaussian. A broadening of the line
profile is also observed from pre-stellar cores to embedded protostars, which
is due mostly to non-thermal motions (turbulence/infall). The widths of the
broad 12CO 3-2 and 10-9 velocity components correlate with those of the narrow
C18O 9-8 profiles, suggesting that the entrained outflowing gas and envelope
motions are related independent of the mass of the protostar. These results
indicate that physical processes in protostellar envelopes have similar
characteristics across the studied luminosity range.

Although the problem of handwriting recognition has been considered for more
than 60 years there are still many open issues, especially in the task of
unconstrained handwritten sentence recognition. This paper focuses on the
automatic system that recognizes continuous English sentence through a
mouse-based gestures in real-time based on Artificial Neural Network. The
proposed Artificial Neural Network is trained using the traditional
backpropagation algorithm for self supervised neural network which provides the
system with great learning ability and thus has proven highly successful in
training for feed-forward Artificial Neural Network. The designed algorithm is
not only capable of translating discrete gesture moves, but also continuous
gestures through the mouse. In this paper we are using the efficient neural
network approach for recognizing English sentence drawn by mouse. This approach
shows an efficient way of extracting the boundary of the English Sentence and
specifies the area of the recognition English sentence where it has been drawn
in an image and then used Artificial Neural Network to recognize the English
sentence. The proposed approach English sentence recognition (ESR) system is
designed and tested successfully. Experimental results show that the higher
speed and accuracy were examined.

  We give sharp rates for the detection of a sparse submatrix of size $m \times

$\{x_{ij,k}\}_k$ have mean $\{\theta_{ij,k}\}_k$ within a Sobolev ellipsoid of
smoothness $\tau >0$ and total energy $\sum_k \theta^2_{ij,k} $ larger than

tending to infinity such that $m/M$, $n/N$ and $\ep$ tend to 0, such that a
test procedure that we construct has asymptotic minimax risk tending to 0.
  We prove corresponding lower bounds under additional assumptions on the
relative size of the submatrix in the large matrix of observations. Except for
these additional conditions our rates are asymptotically sharp. Lower bounds
for hypothesis testing problems mean that no test procedure can distinguish
between the null hypothesis (no signal) and the alternative, i.e. the minimax
risk for testing tends to 1.

amorphous solid whose shear and bulk moduli are finite. Even when done with
constant density, these resulting moduli depend strongly on the rate of
cooling. Understanding this phenomenon calls for analyzing separately the ""Born
term"" that exists also in perfectly ordered materials and the contributions of
the ""excess modes"" that result from glassy disorder. We show that the Born term
is very insensitive to the cooling rate, and all the variation in the shear
modulus is due to the excess modes. We argue that this approach provides a
quantitative understanding of the cooling rate dependence of a basic linear
response coefficient, i.e. the shear modulus.

convex optimization. Linear optimization over matroid polytopes, matching
polytopes and path polytopes are example of problems for which we have simple
and efficient combinatorial algorithms, but whose non-linear convex counterpart
is harder and admits significantly less efficient algorithms. This motivates
the computational model of convex optimization, including the offline, online
and stochastic settings, using a linear optimization oracle. In this
computational model we give several new results that improve over the previous
state-of-the-art. Our main result is a novel conditional gradient algorithm for
smooth and strongly convex optimization over polyhedral sets that performs only
a single linear optimization step over the domain on each iteration and enjoys
a linear convergence rate. This gives an exponential improvement in convergence
rate over previous results.
  Based on this new conditional gradient algorithm we give the first algorithms
for online convex optimization over polyhedral sets that perform only a single
linear optimization step over the domain while having optimal regret
guarantees, answering an open question of Kalai and Vempala, and Hazan and

Possible future finite time singularities for cansidered models have been

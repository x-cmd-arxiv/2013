classified based on a visual grammar descriptor containing a set of semantic

are on average deflected towards and away from the Sun-Earth line respectively.
We used a CH influence parameter (CHIP) that depends on the CH area, average
magnetic field strength, and distance from the CME source region to describe
the influence of all on-disk CHs on the erupting CME. We found that for CHIP
values larger than 2.6 G the MC and non-MC events separate into two distinct
groups where MCs (non-MCs) are deflected towards (away) from the disk center.
Division into two groups was also observed when the distance to the nearest CH
was less than 3.2x10^5 km. At CHIP values less than 2.6 G or at distances of
the nearest CH larger than 3.2x10^5 km the deflection distributions of the MC

results give support to the idea that all CMEs are flux ropes, but those
observed to be non-MCs at 1 AU could be deflected away from the Sun-Earth line
by nearby CHs, making their flux rope structure unobservable at 1 AU.

structure of the archetypal oxide heterointerface system LaAlO3 on SrTiO3 is
presented. High-resolution, hard x-ray photoemission is used to uncover the
occupation of Ti 3d states and the relative energetic alignment - and hence
internal electric fields - within the LaAlO3 layer. Firstly, the Ti 2p core
level spectra clearly show occupation of Ti 3d states already for two unit
cells of LaAlO3. Secondly, the LaAlO3 core levels were seen to shift to lower
binding energy as the LaAlO3 overlayer thickness, n, was increased - agreeing
with the expectations from the canonical electron transfer model for the
emergence of conductivity at the interface. However, not only is the energy
offset of only 300meV between n=2 (insulating interface) and n=6 (metallic
interface) an order of magnitude smaller than the simple expectation, but it is
also clearly not the sum of a series of unit-cell by unit-cell shifts within
the LaAlO3 block. Both of these facts argue against the simple charge-transfer
picture involving a cumulative shift of the LaAlO3 valence bands above the
SrTiO3 conduction bands, resulting in charge transfer only for n>3. Turning to
the theoretical data, our density functional simulations show that the presence
of oxygen vacancies at the LaAlO3 surface at the 25% level reverses the
direction of the internal field in the LaAlO3. Therefore, taking the
experimental and theoretical results together, a consistent picture emerges for
real-life samples in which nature does not wait until n=4 and already for n=2,
mechanisms other than internal-electric-field-driven electron transfer from
idealized LaAlO3 to near-interfacial states in the SrTiO3 substrate are active
in heading off the incipient polarization catastrophe that drives the physics
in these systems.

block-fading multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) channel. A new message arrives at
the beginning of each coherence block, and the decoder is required to output
each message sequentially, after a delay of $T$ coherence blocks. In the
special case when $T=1$, the setup reduces to the quasi-static fading channel.
We establish the optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) in the high
signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regime, and show that it equals $T$ times the DMT
of the quasi-static channel. The converse is based on utilizing the delay
constraint to amplify a local outage event associated with a message, globally
across all the coherence blocks. This approach appears to be new. We propose
two coding schemes that achieve the optimal DMT. The first scheme involves
interleaving of messages, such that each message is transmitted across $T$
consecutive coherence blocks. This scheme requires the knowledge of the delay
constraint at both the encoder and decoder. Our second coding scheme involves a
sequential tree code and is delay-universal i.e., the knowledge of the decoding
delay is not required by the encoder. However, in this scheme we require the
coherence block-length to increase as $\log\mathrm{({SNR})}$, in order to
attain the optimal DMT. Finally, we discuss the case when multiple messages
arrive at uniform intervals {\em within} each coherence period. Through a
simple example we exhibit the sub-optimality of interleaving, and propose
another scheme that achieves the optimal DMT.

move in prograde orbits with low eccentricity and inclination. However, the
list of icy minor bodies moving in orbits with an inclination above 40 deg. has
increased in recent years. The origin of these bodies, and in particular of
those objects in retrograde orbits, is not well determined, and different
scenarios are considered. In this paper, we present new observational and
dynamical data of two objects in retrograde orbits, 2008 YB3 and 2005 VD. We
find that the surface of these extreme objects is depleted of ices and does not
contain the 'ultra-red' matter typical of some Centaurs. Despite small
differences, these objects share common colors and spectral characteristics
with the Trojans, comet nuclei, and the group of grey Centaurs. All of these
populations are supposed to be covered by a mantle of dust responsible for
their reddish- to neutral-color. To investigate if the surface properties and
dynamical evolution of these bodies are related, we integrate their orbits for
10^(8) years to the past. We find a remarkable difference in their dynamical
evolutions: 2005 VD' s evolution is dominated by a Kozai resonance with planet
Jupiter while that of 2008 YB3 is dominated by close encounters with planets
Jupiter and Saturn. Our models suggest that the immediate site of provenance of
2005 VD is the in the Oort cloud, whereas for 2008 YB3 it is in the
trans-Neptunian region. Additionally, the study of their residence time shows
that 2005 VD has spent a larger lapse of time moving in orbits in the region of
the giant planets than 2008 YB3. Together with the small differences in color
between these two objects, with 2005 VD being more neutral than 2008 YB3, this
fact suggests that the surface of 2005 VD has suffered a higher degree of
processing, probably related to cometary activity episodes.

exploit visual grammars characterizing instances of the same program type in

grammar is to represent the visual invariants for each visual jingle using a

consists in comparing the visual similarity of the video signal signature in TV

isolated by the linear simplicity constraints do not change --- they are still
the three sectors (deg), (II+), and (II-). What changes is the characterization
of the continuum Plebanski two-form corresponding to the first two terms in the
asymptotics of the EPRL vertex amplitude for Regge-like boundary data. These
two terms do not correspond to Plebanski sectors (II+) and (II-), but rather to
the two possible signs of the product of the sign of the sector --- +1 for
(II+) and -1 for (II-) --- and the sign of the orientation
$\epsilon_{IJKL}B^{IJ} \wedge B^{KL}$ determined by $B^{IJ}$. This is
consistent with what one would expect, as this is exactly the sign which
classically relates the BF action, in Plebanski sectors (II+) and (II-), to the
Einstein-Hilbert action, whose discretization is the Regge action appearing in
the asymptotics.

spreading patterns in a number of varied environments including infectious
diseases, computer viruses, and urgent messages broadcast to mobile agent

on estimating the average time for the spread to reach a fraction (e.g.,
$\alpha$) of the agents, i.e., the so-called average completion time
$E(T_{\alpha})$. We claim that providing probabilistic guarantee on the time
for the spread $T_{\alpha}$ rather than only its average gives a much better
understanding of the spread, and hence could be used to design improved methods
to prevent epidemics or devise accelerated methods for distributing data. To
demonstrate the benefits, we introduce a new metric $G_{\alpha, \beta}$ that
denotes the time required to guarantee $\alpha$ completion with probability
$\beta$, and develop a new framework to characterize the distribution of
$T_\alpha$ for various spread parameters such as number of seeds, level of
contact rates, and heterogeneity in contact rates. We apply our technique to an
experimental mobility trace of taxies in Shanghai and show that our framework
enables us to allocate resources (i.e., to control spread parameters) for
acceleration of spread in a far more efficient way than the state-of-the-art.

Motivated by the string modular interpretation established previously for

they are isomorphic. Mirror symmetry in particular predicts that the
L-functions of the \Omega-motives of such pairs are identical. In the present
paper this prediction is confirmed by showing that the \Omega-motives of

a more general result establishing an isomorphism between nondiagonally and

formulated here circumvents the difficulty that no mirror construction of the

detected, the brightest yet observed by Chandra from any source, and the

features during the burst; absorption edges have been predicted to be present
in such bursts, but may require a greater degree of photospheric expansion than
the rather moderate expansion seen in this event (a factor of a few). These
observations provide a unique data set to study an X-ray burst over a broad
bandpass and at high spectral resolution (lambda/delta-lambda=200-400). We find
a significant excess of photons at high and low energies compared to the
standard black body spectrum. This excess is well described by a 20-fold
increase of the persistent flux during the burst. We speculate that this
results from burst photons being scattered in the accretion disk corona. These

theoretical modeling of the radiative and hydrodynamical interaction between

respect to his/her profile. This task is performed off-line when the user
defines his/her profile for the first time. Then, when a user query is
submitted to the data warehouse, the system deals with his/her data warehouse
materialized view instead of the whole data warehouse. In other words, the data
warehouse view summaries the data warehouse content for the user by taking into
account his/her preferences. Moreover, we are implementing our data warehouse
personalization approach under the SQL Server 2005 DBMS (DataBase Management
System).

  Coding Interpretation","31 pages, 5 figures. Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information
  Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Wyner's common information was originally defined for a pair of dependent
discrete random variables. Its significance is largely reflected in, hence also
confined to, several existing interpretations in various source coding
problems. This paper attempts to both generalize its definition and to expand
its practical significance by providing a new operational interpretation. The
generalization is two-folded: the number of dependent variables can be
arbitrary, so are the alphabet of those random variables. New properties are
determined for the generalized Wyner's common information of N dependent
variables. More importantly, a lossy source coding interpretation of Wyner's
common information is developed using the Gray-Wyner network. In particular, it
is established that the common information equals to the smallest common
message rate when the total rate is arbitrarily close to the rate distortion
function with joint decoding. A surprising observation is that such equality
holds independent of the values of distortion constraints as long as the
distortions are within some distortion region. Examples about the computation
of common information are given, including that of a pair of dependent Gaussian
random variables.

of an irreducible module in terms of Verma modules is complete reducibility of
the cohomology groups. Essentially, if it exists, every such a resolution is
then given by modules induced by these cohomology groups. We also prove that if
these cohomology groups are completely reducible, a sufficient condition for
the existence of such a resolution is that these groups are isomorphic to the

explicit criteria under which BGG resolutions exist, which are particularly
useful for the superalgebras of type I. For the unitarisable representations of

efficient schemes for the precise evaluation of finite-temperature response
functions of strongly correlated quantum systems in the framework of the

costs and bond dimensions as functions of time and temperature are examined for
the example of the spin-1/2 XXZ Heisenberg chain in the critical XY phase and
the gapped N\'eel phase. The matrix product state purifications occurring in
the algorithms are in one-to-one relation with corresponding matrix product
operators. This notational simplification elucidates implications of
quasi-locality on the computational costs. Based on the observation that there
is considerable freedom in designing efficient tDMRG schemes for the
calculation of dynamical correlators at finite temperatures, a new class of
optimizable schemes, as recently suggested in arXiv:1212.3570, is explained and
analyzed numerically. A specific novel near-optimal scheme that requires no
additional optimization reaches maximum times that are typically increased by a
factor of two, when compared against earlier approaches. These increased
reachable times make many more physical applications accessible. For each of
the described tDMRG schemes, one can devise a corresponding transfer matrix
renormalization group (TMRG) variant.

presented which provides improved performance on test data. Previous research
has shown the value of representing conditional probability distributions
(CPDs) via neural networks(Neal 1992), noisy-OR gates (Neal 1992, Diez 1993)and
decision trees (Friedman and Goldszmidt 1996).The Bernoulli mixture network
(BMN) explicitly represents the CPDs of discrete BN nodes as mixtures of local
distributions,each having a different set of parents.This increases the space
of possible structures which can be considered,enabling the CPDs to have
finer-grained dependencies.The resulting estimation procedure induces a
modelthat is better able to emulate the underlying interactions occurring in
the data than conventional conditional Bernoulli network models.The results for
artificially generated data indicate that overfitting is best reduced by
restricting the complexity of candidate mixture substructures local to each
node. Furthermore, mixtures of very simple substructures can perform almost as
well as more complex ones.The BMN is also applied to data collected from an
online adventure game with an application to keyhole plan recognition. The
results show that the BMN-based model brings a dramatic improvement in
performance over a conventional BN model.

give powerful algorithms for computing their Nash equilibria in certain cases.
An n-player game is given by an undirected graph on n nodes and a set of n
local matrices. The interpretation is that the payoff to player i is determined
entirely by the actions of player i and his neighbors in the graph, and thus
the payoff matrix to player i is indexed only by these players. We thus view
the global n-player game as being composed of interacting local games, each
involving many fewer players. Each player's action may have global impact, but
it occurs through the propagation of local influences.Our main technical result
is an efficient algorithm for computing Nash equilibria when the underlying
graph is a tree (or can be turned into a tree with few node mergings). The
algorithm runs in time polynomial in the size of the representation (the graph
and theassociated local game matrices), and comes in two related but distinct
flavors. The first version involves an approximation step, and computes a
representation of all approximate Nash equilibria (of which there may be an
exponential number in general). The second version allows the exact computation
of Nash equilibria at the expense of weakened complexity bounds. The algorithm
requires only local message-passing between nodes (and thus can be implemented
by the players themselves in a distributed manner). Despite an analogy to
inference in Bayes nets that we develop, the analysis of our algorithm is more
involved than that for the polytree algorithm in, owing partially to the fact
that we must either compute, or select from, an exponential number of potential
solutions. We discuss a number of extensions, such as the computation of
equilibria with desirable global properties (e.g. maximizing global return),
and directions for further research.

computing MAP can be orders of magnitude more expensive than
computingposteriors or MPE. Thus, practitioners generally avoid MAP
computations, resorting instead to approximating them by the most likely value

power-law index, N, that relates the SFR surface density and the molecular gas
surface density and find N=1+/-0.15 for our full data set with some variation
from galaxy to galaxy. However, we caution that a power law treatment
oversimplifies the topic given that we observe correlations between t_dep^mol
and other local and global quantities. The strongest of these are a decreased
t_dep^mol in low-mass, low-metallicity galaxies and a correlation of the
kpc-scale t_dep^mol with dust-to-gas ratio, D/G. These correlations can be
explained by a CO-to-H2 conversion factor that depends on D/G in the
theoretically expected way. This is not a unique interpretation, but external
evidence of conversion factor variations makes it a conservative one. After
applying a D/G-dependent alpha_CO, some weak correlations between t_dep^mol and
local conditions persist. In particular, we observe lower t_dep^mol and
enhanced CO excitation associated with some nuclear gas concentrations. These
appear to reflect real enhancements in the SFR/H2 and t_dep appears multivalued
at fixed Sig_mol, supporting the the idea of ""disk"" and ""starburst"" modes
driven by environmental factors.

offer a natural explanation for the observational finding that the galaxy
circular velocity is an excellent predictor of various galaxy properties. Our
results also indicate that we can expect a significant number of galaxies with

confirm the nature of one CV. We discover one new, X-ray variable candidate CV
with Balmer and HeII emission lines in its optical spectrum; this is the first
X-ray--selected CV confirmed in an open cluster. The number of CVs per unit

NGC6791 are primordial. We compare the X-ray properties of NGC6791 with those
of a few old open (NGC6819, M67) and globular clusters (47Tuc, NGC6397). It is
puzzling that the number of ABs brighter than 1e30 erg/s normalized by cluster

sub-subgiants brighter than 1e30 erg/s are under-represented per unit mass in

of AGNs up to z ~ 1.8 in the COSMOS and Extended Chandra Deep Field-South

the broad Halpha line that has been shown to be a reliable probe of black hole
mass at low redshift. Our sample has existing optical spectroscopy which
provides a detection of MgII, a broad emission line typically used for black
hole mass estimation at z > 1. We carry out a spectral-line fitting procedure
using both Halpha and MgII to determine the virial velocity of gas in the broad
line region, the monochromatic continuum luminosity at 3000 A, and the total
Halpha line luminosity. With a sample of 43 AGNs spanning a range of two
decades in luminosity (i.e., L ~ 10^44-46 ergs/s), we find a tight correlation
between the continuum and line luminosity with a distribution characterized by
<log(L_3000/L_Halpha)> = 1.52 and a dispersion sigma = 0.16. There is also a
close one-to-one relationship between the FWHM of Halpha and of MgII up to
10000 km/s with a dispersion of 0.14 in the distribution of the logarithm of
their ratios. Both of these then lead to there being very good agreement
between Halpha- and MgII-based masses over a wide range in black hole mass
(i.e., M_BH ~ 10^7-9 M_sun). We do find a small offset in MgII-based masses,
relative to those based on Halpha, of +0.17 dex and a dispersion sigma = 0.32.
In general, these results demonstrate that local scaling relations, using MgII
or Halpha, are applicable for AGN at moderate luminosities and up to z ~ 2.

describe different cosmologies; but at the same time the various solutions one
encounters must fulfill some rather nontrivial constraints. Most of the freedom
comes not from the Lagrangian, which contains only a small number of free
parameters (typically 3 depending on counting conventions), but from the fact
that one is in principle free to choose the background reference metric almost
arbitrarily --- which effectively introduces a non-denumerable infinity of free
parameters. In the current paper we stress that although changing the reference
metric would lead to a different cosmological model, this does not mean that
the dynamics of the universe can be entirely divorced from its matter content.
That is, while the choice of reference metric certainly influences the
evolution of the physically observable foreground metric, the effect of matter
cannot be neglected. Nevertheless, the relation between matter and geometry can
be significantly changed in some specific models; effectively since the
graviton would be able to curve the spacetime by itself, without the need of
matter. Thus, even the set of vacuum solutions for massive gravity can have
significant structure. On the other hand, in some cases the effect of the
reference metric could be so strong that no conceivable material content would
be able to drastically affect the cosmological evolution.

hydrodynamical disc models for more than three decades, but the impact of a
magnetic field in the protoplanetary disc is less known. When the disc's
magnetic field is strong enough to prevent horseshoe motion, the corotation
torque is replaced by a torque arising from magnetic resonances. For weak
enough magnetic fields, horseshoe motion and a corotation torque exist, and
recent turbulent MHD simulations have reported the existence of a new component
of the corotation torque in the presence of a mean toroidal field. The aim of
this paper is to investigate the physical origin and the properties of this new
corotation torque. We performed MHD simulations of a low mass planet embedded
in a 2D laminar disc threaded by a weak toroidal magnetic field, with the
effects of turbulence modelled by a viscosity and a resistivity. We confirm
that the interaction between the magnetic field and the horseshoe motion
results in an additional corotation torque on the planet, which we dub the MHD
torque excess. It is caused by the accumulation of the magnetic field along the
downstream separatrices of the planet's horseshoe region, which gives rise to
an azimuthally asymmetric underdense region at that location. The properties of
the MHD torque excess are characterised by varying the slope of the density,
temperature and magnetic field profiles, as well as the diffusion coefficients
and the strength of the magnetic field. The sign of the MHD torque excess
depends on the density and temperature gradients only, and is positive for
profiles expected in protoplanetary discs. Its magnitude is in turn mainly
determined by the strength of the magnetic field and the turbulent resistivity.
The MHD torque excess can be strong enough to reverse migration, even when the
magnetic pressure is less than one percent of the thermal pressure.

injective map assigning the pebbles to vertices of $G$. Let $S$ and $D$ be two

In each step, at most one pebble may move from the vertex it currently occupies

learning. Traditionally, the main planning operation is a full backup based on
the current estimates of the successor states. Consequently, its computation
time is proportional to the number of successor states. In this paper, we
introduce a new planning backup that uses only the current value of a single
successor state and has a computation time independent of the number of
successor states. This new backup, which we call a small backup, opens the door
to a new class of model-based reinforcement learning methods that exhibit much
finer control over their planning process than traditional methods. We
empirically demonstrate that this increased flexibility allows for more
efficient planning by showing that an implementation of prioritized sweeping
based on small backups achieves a substantial performance improvement over
classical implementations.

of two immiscible fluids consists of the Navier-Stokes system coupled with a
convective Cahn-Hilliard equation. In some recent contributions the standard
Cahn-Hilliard equation has been replaced by its nonlocal version. The
corresponding system is physically more relevant and mathematically more
challenging. Indeed, the only known results are essentially the existence of a
global weak solution and the existence of a suitable notion of global attractor
for the corresponding dynamical system defined without uniqueness. In fact,
even in the two-dimensional case, uniqueness of weak solutions is still an open
problem. Here we take a step forward in the case of regular potentials. First
we prove the existence of a (unique) strong solution in two dimensions. Then we
show that any weak solution regularizes in finite time uniformly with respect
to bounded sets of initial data. This result allows us to deduce that the
global attractor is the union of all the bounded complete trajectories which
are strong solutions. We also demonstrate that each trajectory converges to a
single equilibrium, provided that the potential is real analytic and the
external forces vanish.

  copolymer lamellar phases under oscillatory shear","32 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The mesoscale rheology of a lamellar phase of a block copolymer is modeled as
a structured fluid of uniaxial symmetry. The model predicts a viscoelastic
response that depends on the angle between the the local lamellar planes and
velocity gradients. We focus on the stability under oscillatory shear of a two
layer configuration comprising a parallel and a perpendicularly oriented
domain, so that the two layers have a different viscoelastic modulus
$G^{*}(\omega)$. A long wave, low Reynolds number expansion is introduced to
analytically obtain the region of stability. When the response of the two
layers is purely viscous, we recover earlier results according to which the
interface is unstable for non zero Reynolds number flows when the thinner layer
is more viscous. On the other hand, when viscoelasticity is included, we find
that the interface can become unstable even for zero Reynolds number. The
interfacial instability is argued to dynamically favor perpendicular relative
to parallel orientation, and hence we suggest that the perpendicular
orientation would be selected in a multi domain configuration in the range of
frequency $\omega$ in which viscoelastic contrast among orientations is
appreciable.

We assume the spin (or atom) to sit at the origin $0 \in \mathbb{R}^d$ and the
propagation speed $v_p$ of free bosons to be constant, i.e.\ independent of
momentum. In particular, the bosons are massless. We prove detailed bounds on
the mean number of bosons contained in the ball $\{|x| \leq v_p t \}$. In
particular, we prove that, as $t \to \infty$, this number tends to an
asymptotic value that can be naturally identified as the mean number of bosons
bound to the atom in the ground state. Physically, this means that bosons that
are not bound to the atom, are travelling outwards at a speed that is not lower
than $v_p$, hence the term 'minimal velocity estimate'. Additionally, we prove
bounds on the number of emitted bosons with low momentum (soft mode bounds).

the radiative losses rather than the kinetic energy of the wind. After the end
of the main sequence phase when the stellar radius expands by ~ 10 times, the

experiments are limited by noise intrinsic to the pulsar. This stochastic
wideband impulse modulated self-noise (SWIMS) limits pulsar timing precision by
randomly biasing the measured times of arrival and thus increasing the root
mean square (rms) timing residual. We discuss an improved methodology of
removing this bias in the measured times of arrival by including information
about polarized radiation. Observations of J0437-4715 made over a one-week
interval at the Parkes Observatory are used to demonstrate a nearly 40 per cent
improvement in the rms timing residual with this extended analysis. In this
way, based on the observations over a 64 MHz bandwidth centred at 1341 MHz with
integrations over 16.78 s we achieve a 476 ns rms timing residual. In the
absence of systematic error, these results lead to a predicted rms timing
residual of 30 ns in one hour integrations; however the data are currently
limited by variable Faraday rotation in the Earth's ionosphere. The improvement
demonstrated in this work provides an opportunity to increase the sensitivity
in various pulsar timing experiments, for example pulsar timing arrays that

the ambiguity of keyword query makes it difficult to effectively answer keyword
queries, especially for short and vague keyword queries. To address this
challenging problem, in this paper we propose an approach that automatically
diversifies XML keyword search based on its different contexts in the XML data.
Given a short and vague keyword query and XML data to be searched, we firstly
derive keyword search candidates of the query by a classifical feature
selection model. And then, we design an effective XML keyword search
diversification model to measure the quality of each candidate. After that,
three efficient algorithms are proposed to evaluate the possible generated
query candidates representing the diversified search intentions, from which we
can find and return top-$k$ qualified query candidates that are most relevant
to the given keyword query while they can cover maximal number of distinct
results.At last, a comprehensive evaluation on real and synthetic datasets
demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed diversification model and the
efficiency of our algorithms.

the Path Integral Ground State and the Path Integral Monte Carlo methods to
study a system of two dimensional 3He (2d-3He) and a system of 4He adsorbed on
Graphene-Fluoride (GF) and Graphane (GH) at both zero and finite temperature.
The purpose of the study of 4He on GF (GH) was the research of new physical
phenomena, whereas in the case of 2d-3He it was the application of novel
methodologies for the ab-initio study of static and dynamic properties of Fermi
systems. In the case of 2d-3He we have computed the spin susceptibility as
function of density which turned out to be in very good agreement with
experimental data; we have also obtained the first ab-initio evaluation of the
zero-sound mode and the dynamic structure factor of 2d-3He that is in
remarkably good agreement with experiments. In the case of 4He adsorbed on GF
(GH), we determined the zero temperature equilibrium density of the first
monolayer of 4He showing also that the commensurate sqrt(3) x sqrt(3) R30 phase
is unstable on both substrates; at equilibrium density we found that 4He on GF
(GH) is a modulated superfluid with an anisotropic phono-rotonic spectrum; at
high coverages we found an incommensurate triangular solid and, on both GF and
GH, a commensurate phase at filling factor x= 2/7 that is locally stable or at
least metastable. Remarkably, in this commensurate solid phase and for both GF

frequently in the results of the keyword query q over multiple joined

and query refinement for traditional keyword search. Different from the method
of FCT search in a single platform, our proposed approach can efficiently
answer a FCT query using the MapReduce Paradigm without pre-computing the
results of the original keyword query, which is run in parallel platform. In
this work, we can output the final FCT search results by two MapReduce jobs:
the first is to extract the statistical information of the data; and the second
is to calculate the total frequency of each term based on the output of the
first job. At the two MapReduce jobs, we would guarantee the load balance of

planets in ""habitable zones"" where stellar irradiance maintains a temperate
climate on an Earth-like planet. Robust estimates of planet radius and
irradiance require accurate stellar parameters, but most Kepler systems are
faint, making spectroscopy difficult and prioritization of targets desirable.
The parameters of 2035 host stars were estimated by Bayesian analysis and the
probabilities p(HZ) that 2738 candidate or confirmed planets orbit in the
habitable zone were calculated. Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Program models were
compared to photometry from the Kepler Input Catalog, priors for stellar mass,
age, metallicity and distance, and planet transit duration. The analysis
yielded probability density functions for calculating confidence intervals of
planet radius and stellar irradiance, as well as p(HZ). Sixty-two planets have
p(HZ) > 0.5 and a most probable stellar irradiance within habitable zone
limits. Fourteen of these have radii less than twice the Earth; the objects
most resembling Earth in terms of radius and irradiance are KOIs 2626.01 and

stars with Earth-size planets in the habitable zone (eta-Earth) is 0.46, with a

reduce uncertainties by more than a factor of five and permit definitive

The modal analysis allows us to explore localization behavior of a disordered

localization-related phenomena, such as the periodic revival of a propagating
Anderson-localized beam are easily explained in modal language. We characterize
the localization strength by the average width of the guided modes and carry
out a detailed analysis of localization behavior as a function of the optical
and geometrical parameters of the disordered lattice. We also show that in
order to obtain a minimum average mode width, the average width of the
individual random sites in the disordered lattice must be larger than the
wavelength of the light by approximately a factor of two or more, and the
optimum site width for the maximum localization depends on the design
parameters of the disordered lattice.

graphene oxide with different levels of reduction and various chemical
composition, demonstrate the need for additional investigation beyond the basic
principles of graphene functionalization for avoidance of occasionally
contradictions between the predictions from first-principles simulations and
experimental results. Herein, we discuss the current state of modeling of the
different types of graphene using density functional theory (DFT) methods. We
focus on the static (substrate, shape, curvature, strain and doping) and
dynamic (starting point of functionalization, migration barriers and stability
of configurations) aspects that provide a more correct and selective modeling
of the chemisorption of various chemical species on the graphene scaffold.
Based on the recent modeling of experimentally realized functionalization of
different types of graphene we can conclude that the formation of uniform one-
or two-sided functionalized graphene discussed in earlier studies is an
exception to the typical scenarios of graphene chemistry. The presence of
different substrates, defects and lattice distortions, such as ripples and
strain, results in the formation of clusters or lines from the functional
groups. Several configurations of the chemical species on the graphene
substrate have been found to exist with ideal models but are only stable for
graphene functionalized under special conditions. The role of the technical
parameters, such as the functionals and computational methods employed, and the
important guidelines for the modeling of the chemical properties of various
types of graphene are also discussed.

St\""oermer problem within a sphere, with the dipole in its centre. We start
from a Lagrangian approach which allows us to analyze the dynamical properties
of the system, such as the role of a velocity dependent potential, the
symmetries and the conservation properties. We derive the Hamilton equations of
motion and observe that in this restricted case the equations can be reduced to
a quadrature. From the Hamiltonian function we find for the polar angle an
equivalent one-dimensional system of a particle in the presence of an effective
potential. This equivalent potential function, which is a double well
potential, allows us to get a clear description of this dynamical problem. We
are able to find closed horizontal trajectories, as well as their period.
Depending on initial conditions, we can find also some bands covered by
non-periodic trajectories, as well as the conditions for the presence of loops.
Then we obtain by means of numerical integration different plots of the
trajectories in three dimensional graphs in the sphere. This restricted case of
the Stoermer problem, which is formally integrable, is still a nonlinear
problem with a complex and interesting dynamics and we believe that it can
offer the student a better grasp of the subject than the general three

electron-hole Bose liquid with a very rich phase diagram from a Bose metal,
charge ordering insulator to an inhomogeneous Bose superfluid. Optimal
conditions for the disproportionation driven high-T_c superconductivity are
shown to realize only for several Jahn-Teller d^n configurations that permit
the formation of well defined local composite bosons. These are the high-spin
d^4, low-spin d^7, and d^9 configurations given the octahedral crystal field,
and the d^1, high-spin d^6 configurations given the tetrahedral crystal field.
The disproportionation reaction has a peculiar anti-Jahn- Teller character
lifting the bare orbital degeneracy. Superconductivity in the d^4 and d^6
systems at variance with d^1, d^7, and d^9 systems implies an unavoidable
coexistence of the spin-triplet composite bosons and a magnetic lattice. We
argue that unconventional high-T_c superconductivity observed in quasi-2D
cuprates with tetragonally distorted CuO_6 octahedra and iron-based layered
pnictides/chalcogenides with tetrahedrally coordinated Fe^2+ ions can be a key
argument supporting the disproportionation scenario is at work in these

in the range between the low and middle latitudes and to estimate energy
deposition. We show that ionizing particle effect can significantly contribute
in storm-time increase of total electron content (TEC) or positive ionospheric
storm. We present analysis of medium/great flux events during moderate/major
storms on 22 July 2009 and 27 July 2004 as examples for demonstrating
concomitances of enhanced electron fluxes with ionospheric storm positive
phases. Addition experimental support concerning the F2-region rise was
obtained from COSMIC/FS3 radio occultation data for the storm of 22 July 2009.

the point of quantum transition. A quantum theory on protein folding is
proposed. Compared with other dynamical variables such as mobile electrons,
chemical bonds and stretching-bending vibrations the molecular torsion has the
lowest energy and can be looked as the slow variable of the system.
Simultaneously, from the multi-minima property of torsion potential the local
conformational states are well defined. Following the idea that the slow
variables slave the fast ones and using the nonadiabaticity operator method we
deduce the Hamiltonian describing conformational change. It is proved that the
influence of fast variables on the macromolecule can fully be taken into
account through a phase transformation of slow variable wave function. Starting
from the conformation- transition Hamiltonian the nonradiative matrix element
is calculated in two important cases: A, only electrons are fast variables and
the electronic state does not change in the transition process; B, fast
variables are not limited to electrons but the perturbation approximation can
be used. Then, the general formulas for protein folding rate are deduced. The
analytical form of the formula is utilized to study the temperature dependence
of protein folding rate and the curious non-Arrhenius temperature relation is
interpreted. The decoherence time of quantum torsion state is estimated and the
quantum coherence degree of torsional angles in the protein folding is studied
by using temperature dependence data. The proposed folding rate formula gives a
unifying approach for the study of a large class problems of biological
conformational change.

those variables alter the level of tests and induce correlations between tests.
They also change the relative ordering of significance levels among hypotheses.
Poor rankings lead to wasteful and ineffective follow-up studies. The problem
becomes acute for latent variables that are correlated with the primary

isolates the latent variables from the primary one. In simulations, it gives
better ordering of hypotheses than competing methods such as SVA and

method, or periodic retrospective recall, to gather data on daily cigarette
consumption. TLFB is considered adequate for identifying periods of abstinence
and lapse but not for measurement of daily cigarette consumption, thanks to
substantial recall and digit preference biases. With the development of the
hand-held electronic diary (ED), it has become possible to collect cigarette
consumption data using ecological momentary assessment (EMA), or the
instantaneous recording of each cigarette as it is smoked. EMA data, because
they do not rely on retrospective recall, are thought to more accurately
measure cigarette consumption. In this article we present an analysis of
consumption data collected simultaneously by both methods from 236 active
smokers in the pre-quit phase of a smoking cessation study. We define a
statistical model that describes the genesis of the TLFB records as a two-stage
process of mis-remembering and rounding, including fixed and random effects at
each stage. We use Bayesian methods to estimate the model, and we evaluate its
adequacy by studying histograms of imputed values of the latent remembered
cigarette count. Our analysis suggests that both mis-remembering and heaping
contribute substantially to the distortion of self-reported cigarette counts.
Higher nicotine dependence, white ethnicity and male sex are associated with
greater remembered smoking given the EMA count. The model is potentially useful
in other applications where it is desirable to understand the process by which
subjects remember and report true observations.

to the mere existence of sunspots. Aims. We characterize the moat flow (MF) and
Evershed flow (EF) in sunspots to enhance our knowledge of sunspot structures
and photospheric flow properties. Methods. We calibrated HMI synoptic Doppler
maps and used them to analyze 3h time averages of 31 circular, stable, and
fully developed sunspots at heliocentric angles of some 50$^{\circ}$. Assuming
axially symmetrical flow fields, we infer the azimuthally averaged horizontal
velocity component of the MF and EF from 51 velocity maps. We studied the MF
properties (velocity and extension) and elaborate on how these components
depend on sunspot parameters (sunspot size and EF velocity). To explore the
weekly and monthly evolution of MFs, we compare spots rotating from the eastern
to western limbs and spots that reappear on the eastern limb. Results. Our
calibration procedure of HMI Doppler maps yields reliable and consistent
results. In 3h averages, we find the MF decreases on average from some 1000
$\pm$ 200m/s just outside the spot boundary to 500m/s after an additional 4 Mm.
The average MF extension lies at 9.2 $\pm$ 5 Mm, where the velocity drops below
some 180m/s. Neither the MF velocity nor its extension depend significantly on
the sunspot size or EF velocity. But, the EF velocity does show a tendency to
be enhanced with sunspot size. On a time scale of a week and a month, we find
decreasing MF extensions and a tendency for the MF velocity to increase for
strongly decaying sunspots, whereas the changing EF velocity has no impact on
the MF. Conclusions. On 3h averages, the EF velocity scales with the size of
sunspots, while the MF properties show no significant correlation with the EF
or with the sunspot size. This we interpret as a hint that the physical origins
of EF and MF are distinct.

or KM3NeT, respectively. For the first time, it is also possible to derive a
diffuse signal by applying the observed correlation between gamma-ray emission
and radio signal. Radio data from 234 supernova remnants listed in Green's
catalog are used to show that the total diffuse neutrino flux is approximately
a factor of 2.5 higher compared to the sources that are resolved so far. We
show that the signal at above 10 TeV energies can actually become comparable to
the diffuse neutrino flux component from interactions in the interstellar
medium. Recently, the IceCube collaboration announced the detection of a first
diffuse signal of astrophysical high-energy neutrinos. Directional information
cannot unambiguously reveal the nature of the sources at this point due to low
statistics. A number of events come from close to the Galactic center and one
of the main questions is whether at least a part of the signal can be of
Galactic nature. In this paper, we show that the diffuse flux from
well-resolved SNRs is at least a factor of 20 below the observed flux.

vehicles (EVs) at a charging station with multiple charge points. The charging
station is equipped with renewable energy generation devices and can also buy
energy from power grid. The uncertainty of the EV arrival, the intermittence of
the renewable energy, and the variation of the grid power price are taken into
account and described as independent Markov processes. Meanwhile, the charging
energy for each EV is random. The goal is to minimize the mean waiting time of
EVs under the long term constraint on the cost. We propose queue mapping to
convert the EV queue to the charge demand queue and prove the equivalence
between the minimization of the two queues' average length. Then we focus on
the minimization for the average length of the charge demand queue under long
term cost constraint. We propose a framework of Markov decision process (MDP)
to investigate this scheduling problem. The system state includes the charge
demand queue length, the charge demand arrival, the energy level in the storage
battery of the renewable energy, the renewable energy arrival, and the grid
power price. Additionally the number of charging demands and the allocated
energy from the storage battery compose the two-dimensional policy. We derive
two necessary conditions of the optimal policy. Moreover, we discuss the
reduction of the two-dimensional policy to be the number of charging demands
only. We give the sets of system states for which charging no demand and
charging as many demands as possible are optimal, respectively. Finally we
investigate the proposed radical policy and conservative policy numerically.

N2H+ are generally present in disks only at low temperatures where CO depletes
onto grains, consistent with fast destruction of N2H+ by gas-phase CO, and in
situ formation of H2CO through hydrogenation of CO ice. In this scenario H2CO,
CH3OH and N2H+ emission in disks should appear as rings with the inner edge at
the CO midplane snow line. This prediction can be tested directly using

biological samples. A key step in the analysis of mass spectrometry data is to
identify the peptide sequence that, most probably, gave rise to each observed
spectrum. This is often tackled using a database search: each observed spectrum
is compared against a large number of theoretical ""expected"" spectra predicted
from candidate peptide sequences in a database, and the best match is
identified using some heuristic scoring criterion. Here we provide a more
principled, likelihood-based, scoring criterion for this problem. Specifically,
we introduce a probabilistic model that allows one to assess, for each
theoretical spectrum, the probability that it would produce the observed
spectrum. This probabilistic model takes account of peak locations and
intensities, in both observed and theoretical spectra, which enables
incorporation of detailed knowledge of chemical plausibility in peptide
identification. Besides placing peptide scoring on a sounder theoretical
footing, the likelihood-based score also has important practical benefits: it
provides natural measures for assessing the uncertainty of each identification,
and in comparisons on benchmark data it produced more accurate peptide
identifications than other methods, including SEQUEST. Although we focus here
on peptide identification, our scoring rule could easily be integrated into any
downstream analyses that require peptide-spectrum match scores.

finding a polynomial CS-separator. This question is still open even for perfect

factor of delta Scuti stars, using high-resolution spectra of the
high-amplitude pulsator AI Vel and of the fast rotator beta Cas. Methods. The
geometric component of the projection factor (i.e. p0) was calculated using a
limb-darkening model of the intensity distribution for AI Vel, and a
fast-rotator model for beta Cas. Then, using SOPHIE/OHP data for beta Cas and
HARPS/ESO data for AI Vel, we compared the radial velocity curves of several
spectral lines forming at different levels in the atmosphere and derived the
velocity gradient associated to the spectral-line-forming regions in the
atmosphere of the star. This velocity gradient was used to derive a dynamical
projection factor p. Results. We find a flat velocity gradient for both stars

comparing Cepheids and delta Scuti stars, these results bring valuable insights
into the dynamical structure of pulsating star atmospheres. They suggest that
the period-projection factor relation derived for Cepheids is also applicable

with internal rotation profiles as they can be deduced by asteroseismology, to

used (for instance, the evolution of the surface velocities), most of them show
a significant dependence. The models which best fit the changes of the surface
abundances are those computed with the vertical shear diffusion coefficient of
Maeder (1997) and the horizontal shear diffusion coefficient by Zahn (1992).

efficient random access to the input string. Namely, given query access to the
compressed string, it is possible to efficiently recover any symbol of the
input string. The compression algorithm is given as input a parameter $\eps
>0$, and with very high probability increases the length of the compressed
string by at most a factor of $(1+\eps)$. The access time is $O(\log n +
1/\eps^2)$ in expectation, and $O(\log n/\eps^2)$ with high probability. The
scheme relies on sparse transitive-closure spanners. Any (consecutive)
substring of the input string can be retrieved at an additional additive cost
in the running time of the length of the substring. We also formally establish
the necessity of modifying LZ78 so as to allow efficient random access.
Specifically, we construct a family of strings for which $\Omega(n/\log n)$
queries to the LZ78-compressed string are required in order to recover a single
symbol in the input string. The main benefit of the proposed scheme is that it
preserves the online nature and simplicity of LZ78, and that for {\em every}

flexible variance model, which makes it more capable of approximating surfaces

process model, the new predictor is numerically more stable and can more
accurately approximate complex surfaces when the experimental design is sparse.
In addition, the new model can also improve the prediction intervals by

triggers the ""Higgsing"" of the color group, generating the splitting of
instantons into $N_c$ self-dual dyons.
  A number of lattice simulations have provided some evidence for such dyons,
and traced their relation with specific observables, such as the Dirac
eigenvalue spectrum. In this work, we formulate a model, based on one-loop

its variants, and as an application, we show how the decay of the popular
Simoncelli wavelets can be improved by appropriately modifying their Fourier
transforms. By applying the Riesz transform to these new wavelets, we obtain
steerable frames with rapid decay.

framework for determining the equilibrium properties of inhomogeneous fluids.
We report a generalization of DFT to treat the non-equilibrium dynamics of
classical many-body systems subject to Brownian dynamics. Our approach is based
upon a dynamical functional consisting of reversible free energy changes and
irreversible power dissipation. Minimization of this `free power' functional
with respect to the microscopic one-body current yields a closed equation of
motion. In the equililibrium limit the theory recovers the standard variational
principle of DFT. The adiabatic dynamical density functional theory is obtained
when approximating the power dissipation functional by that of an ideal gas.
Approximations to the excess (over ideal) power dissipation yield numerically
tractable equations of motion beyond the adiabatic approximation, opening the
door to the systematic study of systems far from equilibrium.

equations and the constraints on the hypersurface comprise a separated system
of equations that can be independently solved. Contrary to the apparent
behavior induced by some choices of coordinates, the metric we have obtained is
completely regular everywhere and is free of singularities (except the
well-known Friedmann singularity at $t=0$). The physical features of this
solution are elucidated by using the Quasi-Maxwellian equations (a set of third
order differential equations describing the dynamics of the gravitational field
in terms of the Weyl tensor). The motion of test particles is also analyzed in
order to confirm the maximal extension of the manifold under consideration.
These results indicate that the anisotropic pressure could mimic dark matter
effects on certain geodesic congruences keeping the cosmic flow unchanged.

We show
that this process can be explained by $E\times B$ drift. The analytic solution
obtained in this paper are quantitatively in accordance with previous results.
Our simulation results show that the Maxwellian distribution is broadened
during the pseudoheating; however, the shape of the broadening distribution
function depends on the number of wave modes (i.e., a wave spectrum or a
monochromatic dispersionless wave) and the initial thermal speed of ions
($v_{p}$). It is of particular interests to find that the Maxwellian shape is
more likely to maintain during the pseudoheating under a wave spectrum compared
with a monochromatic wave. It significantly improves our understanding of
heating processes in interplanetary space where Alfv\'enic turbulences exist
pervasively. Compared with a monochromatic Alfv\'en wave, $E\times B$ drift
produces more energetic particles in a broad spectrum of Alfv\'en waves,
especially when the Alfv\'enic turbulence with phase coherent wave modes is
given. Such particles may escape from the region of interaction with the
Alfv\'en waves and can contribute to fast particle population in astrophysical
and space plasmas.

Standard treatment for many primary and recurrent gynecologic cancer cases
includes a combination of external beam radiation, followed by brachytherapy.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is benefitial in diagnostic evaluation, in
mapping the tumor location to tailor radiation dose, and in monitoring the
tumor response to treatment. Initial studies of MR-guidance in gynecologic
brachtherapy demonstrate the ability to optimize tumor coverage and reduce
radiation dose to normal tissues, resulting in improved outcomes for patients.
In this article we describe a methodology to aid applicator placement and
treatment planning for 3 Tesla (3T) MR-guided brachytherapy that was developed
specifically for gynecologic cancers. This has been used in 18 cases to date in
the Advanced Multimodality Image Guided Operating suite at Brigham and Women's
Hospital. It is comprised of state of the art methods for MR imaging, image
analysis, and treatment planning. An MR sequence using 3D-balanced steady state
free precession in a 3T MR scan was identified as the best sequence for
catheter identification with ballooning artifact at the tip. 3D treatment
planning was performed using MR images. Item in development include a software
module designed to support virtual needle trajectory planning that includes
probabilistic bias correction, graph based segmentation, and image registration
algorithms. The results demonstrate that 3T MR has a role in gynecologic
brachytherapy. These novel developments improve targeted treatment to the tumor
while sparing the normal tissues.

seen to generally have reasonably good agreement with experiment. We also
investigate the performance of MCCI when applied to ionisation energies and
electron affinities of atoms in an aug-cc-pVQZ basis. We compare the MCCI
results with full configuration-interaction quantum Monte Carlo [3,4] and
`exact' non-relativistic results [3,4]. We show that MCCI could be a useful
alternative for the calculation of atomic ionisation energies however electron
affinities appear much more challenging for MCCI. Due to the small magnitude of
the electron affinities their percentage errors can be high, but with regards
to absolute errors MCCI performs similarly for ionisation energies and electron
affinities.

process in the tunneling regime, causing significant modifications to the
electron momentum distributions and photoelectron spectra, while its effects in
the multiphoton regime appear to be negligible. Indeed, through tunneling ATI
process, one can obtain higher energy electrons as well as high degree of

prove assertions in a certain logic in a correct way. There are many logical
systems, and many ways of formalizing them, e.g., using natural deduction or
sequent calculus. Calculus of structures (CoS) is a new formalism proposed by
Alessio Guglielmi in 2004 that generalizes sequent calculus in the sense that
inference rules can be applied at any depth inside a formula, rather than only
to the main connective. With this feature, proofs in CoS are shorter than in
any other formalism supporting analytical proofs. Although it is great to have
the freedom and expressiveness of CoS, under the point of view of proof search
more freedom means a larger search space. And that should be restricted when
looking for complete automation of deductive systems. Some efforts were made to
reduce this non-determinism, but they are all basically operational approaches,
and no solid theoretical result regarding the computational behaviour of CoS
has been achieved so far. The main focus of this thesis is to discuss ways to
propose a proof search strategy for CoS suitable to implementation. This
strategy should be theoretical instead of purely operational. We introduce the
concept of incoherence number of substructures inside structures and we use
this concept to achieve our main result: there is an algorithm that, according
to our conjecture, corresponds to a proof search strategy to every provable
structure in the subsystem of FBV (the multiplicative linear logic MLL plus the
rule mix) containing only pairwise distinct atoms. Our algorithm is implemented
and we believe our strategy is a good starting point to exploit the
computational aspects of CoS in more general systems, like BV itself.

in estimating local radioelectric properties of materials recovering an object

intensive exploitation of an efficient 2D Maxwell solver, distributed on high
performance computing machines. Applied to a large training data set, a
statistical analysis reduces the problem to a simpler probabilistic metamodel,
on which Bayesian inference can be performed. Considering the radioelectric

only for compact irradiating sources situated close to the black hole. This is
the only case where the black hole spin can be unambiguously determined. In all
other cases the line shape is narrower, which could either be explained by a
low spin or an elongated source. We conclude that for all those cases and

  on Girth","accepted by IEEE ISIT 2013",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Binary 0-1 measurement matrices, especially those from coding theory, were
introduced to compressed sensing (CS) recently. Good measurement matrices with
preferred properties, e.g., the restricted isometry property (RIP) and
nullspace property (NSP), have no known general ways to be efficiently checked.
Khajehnejad \emph{et al.} made use of \emph{girth} to certify the good
performances of sparse binary measurement matrices. In this paper, we examine
the performance of binary measurement matrices with uniform column weight and
arbitrary girth under basis pursuit. Explicit sufficient conditions of exact
reconstruction %only including $\gamma$ and $g$ are obtained, which improve the
previous results derived from RIP for any girth $g$ and results from NSP when
$g/2$ is odd. Moreover, we derive explicit $l_1/l_1$, $l_2/l_1$ and
$l_\infty/l_1$ sparse approximation guarantees. These results further show that
large girth has positive impacts on the performance of binary measurement
matrices under basis pursuit, and the binary parity-check matrices of good LDPC
codes are important candidates of measurement matrices.

above the quantum capacity, the fidelity makes a discontinuous jump from 1 to
at most 0.707, asymptotically. A similar result can be shown for the private
(classical) capacity. Furthermore, we can show that if the strong converse
holds for symmetric channels (which have quantum capacity zero), then
degradable channels obey the strong converse: The above-mentioned asymptotic
jump of the fidelity at the quantum capacity is then from 1 down to 0.

Jardine's universal Hasse-Witt invariants and $B_{{\bf O}(q)}$ is the
classifying topos of ${\bf O}(q)$ as defined by Grothendieck and Giraud. The
cohomology ring $H^*(B_{{\bf O}(q)},{\bf Z}/2{\bf Z})$ contains canonical
classes $\mathrm{det}[q]$ and $[C_q]$ of degree 1 and 2 respectively, which are
obtained from the determinant map and the Clifford group of $q$. The classical
Hasse-Witt invariants $w_i(q)$ live in the ring $A_Y$.
  Our main theorem provides a computation of ${det}[q]$ and $[C_{q}]$ as
polynomials in $HW_{1}(q)$ and $HW_{2}(q)$ with coefficients in $A_Y$ written
in terms of $w_1(q),w_2(q)\in A_Y$. This result is the source of numerous
standard comparison formulas for classical Hasses-Witt invariants of quadratic

cocycles in the topos $B_{{\bf O}(q)}$. This requires a general study of the
cohomology of the classifying topos of a group scheme, which we carry out in

Three science parks from Yorkshire and the Humber in the UK were analysed with
webometric and social network analysis techniques. Interlinking networks were
generated through the combination of two different data sets extracted from
three sources (Yahoo!, Bing, SocSciBot). These networks suggest that
institutional sectors, representing business, universities and public bodies,
are primarily tied together by a core formed by research institutions, support
structure organisations and business developers. The comparison of the findings
with traditional indicators suggests that the web-based networks reflect the
offline conditions and policy measures adopted in the region, giving some
evidence that the webometric approach is plausible to investigating science
park networks. This is the first study that applies a web-based approach to
investigate to what extent the science parks facilitate a closer interaction
between the heterogeneous organisations that converge in R&D networks. This
indicates that link analysis may help to get a first insight into the

order to obtain the boundedness of certain functional calculi for semigroup
generators. In particular, it is proved that if $-A$ generates a
$C_0$-semigroup on a Hilbert space, then for each $\tau>0$ the operator $A$ has
a bounded calculus for the closed ideal of bounded holomorphic functions on a
(sufficiently large) right half-plane that satisfy
$f(z)=O(e^{-\tau\textrm{Re}(z)})$ as $|z|\rightarrow \infty$. The bound of this
calculus grows at most logarithmically as $\tau\searrow 0$. As a consequence,
$f(A)$ is a bounded operator for each holomorphic function $f$ (on a right
half-plane) with polynomial decay at $\infty$. Then we show that each semigroup
generator has a so-called (strong) $m$-bounded calculus for all
$m\in\mathbb{N}$, and that this property characterizes semigroup generators.
Similar results are obtained if the underlying Banach space is a UMD space.
Upon restriction to so-called $\gamma$-bounded semigroups, the Hilbert space
results actually hold in general Banach spaces.

Frequencies of flexural modes are sensitive to compressive stress; its
variation under stress can be related to the anomalous thermal expansion via a
simple model based in classical Elasticity Theory [Phys. Rev. B 86, 144103].
Under compression, flexural modes are responsible for a long wavelength
rippling with a large amplitude and a marked anharmonic behavior. This is
compared with corrugations created by thermal fluctuations and the adsorption
of a light impurity (hydrogen). Typical values for the later are in the
sub-Angstrom regime, while maximum corrugations associated to bending modes
quickly increase up to a few Angstroms under a compressive stress, due to the

the nature of the arguments of a predicate, and the possible adaptation of a

physical properties and ranging from nanoelectronics to sensing and photonics.
In addition to graphene, the most studied 2D material, monolayers of other
layered materials such as semiconducting dichalcogenides MoS2 or WSe2 are
gaining in importance as promising insulators and channel materials for
field-effect transistors (FETs). The presence of a direct band gap in monolayer
MoS2 due to quantum mechanical confinement, allows room-temperature
field-effect transistors with an on/off ratio exceeding 108. The presence of
high-k dielectrics in these devices enhanced their mobility, but the mechanisms
are not well understood. Here, we report on electrical transport measurements
on MoS2 FETs in different dielectric configurations. Mobility dependence on
temperature shows clear evidence of the strong suppression of charge impurity
scattering in dual-gate devices with a top-gate dielectric together with phonon
scattering that shows a weaker than expected temperature dependence. High
levels of doping achieved in dual-gate devices also allow the observation of a
metal-insulator transition in monolayer MoS2. Our work opens up the way to
further improvements in 2D semiconductor performance and introduces MoS2 as an
interesting system for studying correlation effects in mesoscopic systems.

of any perturbation to the target profile decays monotonically. The
controller's estimate of the flow state is similarly guaranteed to converge to
the true value. We present a one-time off-line synthesis procedure, which
generalises to accommodate more restrictive actuation and sensing arrangements,
with conditions for existence for the controller given in this case. The
control is tested in turbulent channel flow ($Re_\tau=100$) using full-domain
sensing and actuation on the wall-normal velocity. Concentrated at the point of
maximum inflection in the mean profile, the control directly counters the
supply of turbulence energy arising from the interaction of the wall-normal
perturbations with the flow shear. It is found that the control is only
required for the larger-scale motions, specifically those above the scale of
the mean streak spacing. Minimal control effort is required once laminar flow
is achieved. The response of the near-wall flow is examined in detail, with
particular emphasis on the pressure and wall-normal velocity fields, in the
context of Landahl's theory of sheared turbulence.

Following a Bayesian approach, we propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm

metastable state e within a state-dependent optical lattice. In this scheme,
the alternating pattern of lattice sites hosting g and e states depict a
checkerboard structure, allowing for laser-assisted tunneling along both
spatial directions. In this configuration, the nuclear spin of the atoms can be
viewed as a ""flavor"" quantum number undergoing non-Abelian tunneling along
nearest-neighbor links. We show that this technique can be useful to simulate
the equivalent of the Haldane quantum Hall model using cold atoms trapped in
square optical lattices, offering an interesting route to realize Chern
insulators. The emblematic Haldane model is particularly suited to investigate
the physics of topological insulators, but requires, in its original form,
complex hopping terms beyond nearest-neighboring sites. In general, this
drawback inhibits a direct realization with cold atoms, using standard
laser-induced tunneling techniques. We demonstrate that a simple mapping allows
to express this model in terms of matrix hopping operators, that are defined on
a standard square lattice. This mapping is investigated for two models that
lead to anomalous quantum Hall phases. We discuss the practical implementation

strong non-resonant light, its rovibrational levels get hybridized. We study
the spectroscopic signatures of this effect for transitions between the
X$^1\Sigma_g^+$ electronic ground state and the A$^1\Sigma_u^+$ and b$^3\Pi_u$
excited state manifold. The latter is characterized by strong perturbations due
to the spin-orbit interaction. We find that for non-resonant field strengths of
the order $10^9$W/cm$^2$, the spin-orbit interaction and coupling to the
non-resonant field become comparable. The non-resonant field can then be used
to control the singlet-triplet character of a rovibrational level.

importance in many fields of science, from identifying pulsar signals in
astronomy to measuring heart beats in medicine. In circumstances where one is
interested in specific autocorrelation functions that do not fit into any
simple families of models, such as auto-regressive moving average (ARMA),
estimating model parameters is generally approached in one of two ways: by
fitting the model autocorrelation function to a non-parameteric autocorrelation
estimate via regression analysis or by fitting the model autocorrelation
function directly to the data via maximum likelihood. Prior literature suggests
that variogram regression yields parameter estimates of comparable quality to
maximum likelihood. In this letter we demonstrate that, as sample size is
increases, the accuracy of the maximum-likelihood estimates (MLE) ultimately
improves by orders of magnitude beyond that of variogram regression. For
relatively continuous and Gaussian processes, this improvement can occur for
sample sizes of less than 100. Moreover, even where the accuracy of these
methods is comparable, the MLE remains almost universally better and, more
critically, variogram regression does not provide reliable confidence
intervals. Inaccurate regression parameter estimates are typically accompanied
by underestimated standard errors, whereas likelihood provides reliable
confidence intervals.

leave open the question of what determines the order of r(A^2 D^2) with respect
to r(A) r(A D^2). This is a special case of a broad class of problems that
arise repeatedly in ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Here, sufficient
conditions are found on A that determine orders in either direction. For a
diagonally symmetrizable nonnegative matrix A with all positive eigenvalues and
nonnegative D, r(A^2 D) <= r(A) r(AD). The reverse holds if all of the
eigenvalues of A are negative besides the Perron root. This is a particular
case of the more general result that r(A [(1-m) r(B) I + m B] D) is monotonic
in m when all non-Perron eigenvalues of A have the same sign --- decreasing for
positive signs and increasing for negative signs, for symmetrizable nonnegative
A and B that commute. Commuting matrices include the Kronecker products A, B in
{\otimes_{i=1}^L M_i^{t_i}}, t_i in {0, 1, 2, ...}, which comprise a class of
application for these results. This machinery allows analysis of the sign of
d/d m_j r({\otimes_{i=1}^L[(1-m_i) r(A_i) I_i + m_i A_i]}D). The eigenvalue
sign conditions also provide lower or upper bounds to the harmonic mean of the
expected sojourn times of Markov chains. These inequalities appear in the
asymptotic growth rates of viral quasispecies, models for the evolution of
dispersal in random environments, and the evolution of site-specific mutation
rates over the entire genome.

Below ~1 K the muon relaxation is typical of a magnetic insulator with a
spin-liquid type ground state, i.e. without broken symmetries or frozen
moments. However, the AC susceptibility revealed a dilute-spin-glass like
transition below ~ 1 K. Antiferromagnetically coupled Mo5+ 4d1 electrons in
triply degenerate t2g orbitals are in this material arranged in a geometrically
frustrated fcc lattice. Bulk magnetic susceptibility data has previously been
interpreted in terms of a freezing to a heterogeneous state with non-magnetic
sites where 4d^1 electrons have paired in spin-singlets dimers, and residual
unpaired Mo5+ 4d1 electrons. Based on the magnetic heat capacity data it has
been suggested that this heterogeneity is the result of kinetic constraints
intrinsic to the physics of the pure system (possibly due to topological
overprotection), leading to a self-induced glass of valence bonds between
neighbouring 4d1 electrons. The muSR relaxation unambiguously points to a
static heterogeneous state with a static arrangement of unpaired electrons
isolated by spin-singlet (valence bond) dimers between the majority of Mo5+ 4d
electrons. The AC susceptibility data indicate that the residual magnetic
moments freeze into a dilute-spin-glass-like state. This is in apparent
contradiction with the muon-spin decoupling at 50 mK in fields up to 200 mT,
which indicates that, remarkably, the time scale of the field fluctuations from
the residual moments is ~ 5 ns. Comparable behaviour has been observed in other
geometrically frustrated magnets with spin-liquid-like behaviour and the
implications of our observations on Ba2YMoO6 are discussed in this context.

exoplanets that transit across main-sequence stars, let alone the detection of
bio-markers in their atmospheres, will be challenging even with future
facilities. It has been noted that white dwarfs (WDs) have long-lived habitable
zones and that a large fraction of WDs may host planets. We point out that
during a transit of an Earth-mass planet across a WD, the planet's atmospheric
transmission spectrum obtains a much higher contrast over the stellar
background compared to a main-sequence host, because of the small surface area
of the WD. The most prominent bio-marker in the present-day terrestrial
atmosphere, molecular oxygen, is readily detectable in a WD transit via its
A-band absorption at ~0.76 micron. A potentially life-sustaining Earth-like
planet transiting a WD can be found by assembling a suitable sample of ~500 WDs
and then surveying them for transits using small telescopes. If and when such a
transiting case is found, the O_2 absorption in the planetary atmospheric
transmission spectrum would be detectable with the James Webb Space Telescope
(JWST) in about 5 hours of total exposure time, integrated over 160 2-minute
transits. Characterization of the planet atmosphere using other tracers such as
water vapour and CO_2 will be considerably easier. We demonstrate this future

two other statistics besides their abundance: the stacked tangential-shear
profiles and the peak-peak correlation function. We use a large ensemble of
simulated WL maps with survey specifications relevant to future missions like
Euclid and LSST, to explore the three peak probes. We find that the correlation
function of peaks with high signal-to-noise (S/N) measured from fields of size
144 sq. deg. has a maximum of ~0.3 at an angular scale ~10 arcmin. For peaks
with smaller S/N, the amplitude of the correlation function decreases, and its
maximum occurs on smaller angular scales. We compare the peak observables
measured with and without shape noise and find that for S/N~3 only ~5% of the
peaks are due to large-scale structures, the rest being generated by shape
noise. The covariance matrix of the probes is examined: the correlation
function is only weakly covariant on scales < 30 arcmin, and slightly more on
larger scales; the shear profiles are very correlated for theta > 2 arcmin,
with a correlation coefficient as high as 0.7. Using the Fisher-matrix
formalism, we compute the cosmological constraints for {Om_m, sig_8, w, n_s}
considering each probe separately, as well as in combination. We find that the
correlation function of peaks and shear profiles yield marginalized errors
which are larger by a factor of 2-4 for {Om_m, sig_8} than the errors yielded
by the peak abundance alone, while the errors for {w, n_s} are similar. By
combining the three probes, the marginalized constraints are tightened by a
factor of ~2 compared to the peak abundance alone, the least contributor to the
error reduction being the correlation function. This work therefore recommends
that future WL surveys use shear peaks beyond their abundance in order to
constrain the cosmological model.

  Isomorphic Bundles","13 Pages, 6 figures",,,,"cond-mat.soft cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Densely-packed bundles of biological filaments (filamentous proteins) are
common and critical structural elements in range of biological materials. While
most bundles form from intrinsically straight filaments, there are notable
examples of protein filaments possessing a natural, or intrinsic, curvature,
such as the helical bacterial flagellum. We study the non-linear interplay
between thermodynamic preference for dense and regular inter-filament packing
and the mechanical preference for uniform filament shape in bundles of
helically-curved filaments. Geometric constraints in bundles make perfect
inter-filament (constant spacing, or isometric) packing incompatible with
perfect intra-filament (constant shape, or isomorphic) packing. As a
consequence, we predict that bundle packing exhibits a strong sensitivity to
bundle size, evolving from the isometric packing at small radii to an
isomorphic packing at large radii. The nature of the transition between these
extremal states depends on thermodynamic costs of packing distortion, with
packing in elastically-constrained bundles evolving smoothly with size, while
packing in osmotically-compressed bundles may exhibit a singular transition
from the isometric packing at a finite bundle radius. We consider the
equilibrium assembly of bundles in a saturated solution of filaments and show
that mechanical cost of isomorphic packing leads to self-limited equilibrium
bundle diameters, whose size and range of thermodynamic stability depend both
on condensation mechanism, as well as the helical geometry of filaments.

features a sharp break at $z=2.6\pm 0.2$ with a rapid incline towards lower

all those observations can be understood as the consequence of a transition

long-lived low-mass stars performed with 8-10m class telescopes, together with
high-precision photometry of Galactic GCs obtained with HST,have brought
compelling clues on the presence of multiple stellar populations in individual
GCs. These stellar subgroups can be recognized thanks to their different

multimodal sequences in the colour-magnitude diagrams (see Piotto, this

stress shear thinning fluid (Carbopol- 980) is presented. The investigation of
the solid-fluid transition in a rheometric flow in the presence and in the ab-
sence of the wall slip reveals a coupling between the irreversible deformation
states and the wall slip phenomenon. Particularly, the presence of wall slip
nearly suppresses the scaling of the deformation power deficit associated to
the rheological hysteresis with the rate at which the material is forced. The
irreversible solid-fluid transition and the wall slip behaviour emerge in the
same range of the applied stresses and thus, the two phenomena appear to be
coupled to each other. In-situ measurements of the flow fields performed during
an increasing/decreasing stepped pressure ramp reveal three distinct flow
regimes: solid (pluglike), solid-fluid and fluid. The deformation power deficit
associated with the hysteresis observed during the increasing/decreasing
branches of the pressure ramps reveals a dependence on the rate at which the
unsteady flow is driven consistent with that observed during the rheological
measurements in the presence of slip. The dependence of the slip velocity on
the wall shear stresses reveals a Navier-type slip behaviour only within the
fluid flow regime, which indicates that the wall slip phenomenon is directly
coupled to the solid-fluid transition. A universal scaling of the slip velocity
with the wall velocity gradients is found and the slip length is independent on
the characteristic time of forcing t0. The paper closes with a discussion of
the main findings, their possible impact on our current understanding of the
yielding and slip behaviour of Carbopol gels. Several steps worth being pursued
by future experimental/theoretical studies are proposed.

an extreme mass-ratio of q=0.10, placing it among the few contact binaries with
the lowest known mass-ratios. The mean density of the primary component suggest
that it has evolved away from the ZAMS. Eighty-four times of minimum light are

whether the implementation of radio mode AGN feedback, which is responsible for
terminating the formation of stars in high mass galaxies, provides an adequate
match to current high-redshift observations. The fraction of quenched galaxies
as a function of stellar mass in the models is in good agreement with data at
z=0 and z=1. By z=2, there are too few quenched galaxies with low stellar
masses in the models. At z=2, the population of galaxies with no ongoing star
formation is clearly separated from the `main sequence' of star-forming
galaxies in the data. This is not found in the models, because z=2 galaxies
with stellar masses less than 10^11 solar masses are predicted to host black
holes with relatively low masses (less than 10^8 solar masses). The current
implementation of radio mode feedback from such black holes reduces the cooling
rates from the surrounding halo, but does not generate sufficient energy to
stop star formation entirely. We suggest that the models may be brought into
better agreement with the data if black hole growth is triggered by disc
instabilities in addition to major mergers, and if feedback mechanisms
associated with the formation of galactic bulges act to quench star formation

yield considerable new insight, such as providing a technical explanation as to
why the well known Gaussian approximation is quite robust to large SNR for the

employ the Edgeworth expansion technique to propose a refined Gaussian
approximation which is shown to give a very accurate closed-form
characterization of the mutual information distribution, both around the mean

fails remarkably). For stronger deviations where the Edgeworth expansion
becomes unwieldy, we employ the saddle point method and asymptotic integration
tools to establish new analytical characterizations which are shown to be very

abundances for 10 different elements, we find that only half of the purported
AB Dor stream members could possibly constitute a statistically chemically
homogeneous sample. Some stream members with 3D velocities were hundreds of
parsecs from the AB Dor nucleus ~10^8 yr ago, and hence were unlikely to share
a common origin. We conclude that the published lists of AB Dor moving group
stream members are unlikely to represent the dispersed remnant of a single star
formation episode. A subsample of the stream stars appears to be both
statistically chemically homogeneous and in the vicinity of the AB Dor nucleus
at birth. Their mean metallicity is [Fe/H] = 0.02 +/- 0.02 dex, which we
consider representative for the AB Dor group. Finally, we report a strong lower
limit on the age of the AB Dor nucleus of >110 Myr based on the pre-MS
contraction times for K-type members which have reached the main sequence.

correlated channel model, we demonstrate the gain of matching the subband size
to the underlying channel statistics motivating heterogeneous feedback design
with different subband sizes and feedback resources across clusters of users.
Employing the best-M partial feedback strategy, users with smaller subband size
would convey more partial feedback to match the frequency selectivity. In order
to develop an analytical framework to investigate the impact of partial
feedback and potential imperfections, we leverage the multi-cluster subband
fading model. The perfect feedback scenario is thoroughly analyzed, and the
closed form expression for the average sum rate is derived for the
heterogeneous partial feedback system. We proceed to examine the effect of
imperfections due to channel estimation error and feedback delay, which leads
to additional consideration of system outage. Two transmission strategies: the
fix rate and the variable rate, are considered for the outage analysis. We also
investigate how to adapt to the imperfections in order to maximize the average
goodput under heterogeneous partial feedback.

update their local parameter estimates by appropriately combining the data
received from their neighbors and the locally sensed new information
(innovation). Under global observability of the networked sensing model, i.e.,
the ability to distinguish between different instances of the parameter value
based on the joint observation statistics, and mean connectivity of the
inter-agent communication network, the proposed estimator is shown to yield
consistent parameter estimates at each network agent. Further, it is shown that
the distributed estimator is asymptotically efficient, in that, the asymptotic
covariances of the agent estimates coincide with that of the optimal
centralized estimator, i.e., the inverse of the centralized Fisher information
rate. From a technical viewpoint, the proposed distributed estimator leads to
non-Markovian mixed timescale stochastic recursions and the analytical methods
developed in the paper contribute to the general theory of distributed
stochastic approximation.

precession for these pairs acquires a slow component, which leads to a slowing
down of recombination. We study the effect of soft pairs on organic
magnetoresistance, where slow recombination translates into blocking of the
passage of current. It appears that when b_e and b_h have identical gaussian
distributions the contribution of soft pairs to the current does not depend on
B. Amazingly, small inequivalence in the rms values of b_e and b_h gives rise
to a magnetic field response, and it becomes progressively stronger as the
inequivalence increases. We find the expression for this response by performing
the averaging over b_e, b_h analytically. Another source of magnetic field
response in the regime when current is dominated by soft pairs is inequivalence
of the g-factors of the pair partners. Our analytical calculation indicates
that for this mechanism the response has an opposite sign.

compatible with such type of diffusion. High resolution numerical simulations
using Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) of the new model are presented, showing
that the chemotactic term enhances the velocity of propagation of the colony
envelope for dense-branching morphologies. In addition, the chemotaxis seems to
stabilize the formation of branches in the soft-agar, low-nutrient regime. An
asymptotic estimation predicts the growth velocity of the colony envelope as a
function of both the nutrient concentration and the chemotactic sensitivity.
For fixed nutrient concentrations, the growth velocity is an increasing
function of the chemotactic sensitivity.

(OFDM) relay channels, where the direct link between the two terminal nodes is
too weak to be used for data transmission. The widely known per-subcarrier
decode-and-forward (DF) relay strategy, treats each subcarrier as a separate
channel, and performs independent channel coding over each subcarrier. We show
that this per-subcarrier DF relay strategy is only a suboptimal DF relay
strategy, and present a multi-subcarrier DF relay strategy which utilizes
cross-subcarrier channel coding to achieve a larger rate region. We then
propose an optimal resource allocation algorithm to characterize the achievable
rate region of the multi-subcarrier DF relay strategy. The computational
complexity of this algorithm is much smaller than that of standard Lagrangian
duality optimization algorithms. We further analyze the asymptotic performance
of two-way relay strategies including the above two DF relay strategies and an
amplify-and-forward (AF) relay strategy. The analysis shows that the
multi-subcarrier DF relay strategy tends to achieve the capacity region of the
two-way OFDM relay channels in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime,
while the AF relay strategy tends to achieve the multiplexing gain region of
the two-way OFDM relay channels in the high SNR regime. Numerical results are
provided to justify all the analytical results and the efficacy of the proposed

using one-way functions. The latter are usually regarded as a central concept
of cryptography, but the very existence of one-way functions depends on
difficult conjectures in complexity theory, most notably on the notorious ""$P
\ne NP$"" conjecture.
  In this paper, we suggest protocols for secure computation of the sum,
product, and some other functions, without using any one-way functions. A new
input that we offer here is that, in contrast with other proposals, we conceal
""intermediate results"" of a computation. For example, when we compute the sum
of $k$ numbers, only the final result is known to the parties; partial sums are
not known to anybody. Other applications of our method include voting/rating
over insecure channels and a rather elegant and efficient solution of Yao's
""millionaires' problem"".
  Then, while it is fairly obvious that a secure (bit) commitment between two
parties is impossible without a one-way function, we show that it is possible
if the number of parties is at least 3. We also show how our (bit) commitment
scheme for 3 parties can be used to arrange an unconditionally secure (bit)
commitment between just two parties if they use a ""dummy"" (e.g., a computer) as
the third party. We explain how our concept of a ""dummy"" is different from a
well-known concept of a ""trusted third party"".
  We also suggest a protocol, without using a one-way function, for ""mental
poker"", i.e., a fair card dealing (and playing) over distance. We also propose
a secret sharing scheme where an advantage over Shamir's and other known secret
sharing schemes is that nobody, including the dealer, ends up knowing the
shares owned by any particular player.
  It should be mentioned that computational cost of our protocols is negligible
to the point that all of them can be executed without a computer.

$k=1$ \cite{garey1979computers}. This paper first gives a simple approximation
algorithm with factor-$(2,2)$, i.e. the algorithm computes a solution with
delay and cost bounded by $2*D$ and $2*C$ respectively. Later, a novel improved
approximation algorithm with ratio
$(1+\beta,\,\max\{2,\,1+\ln\frac{1}{\beta}\})$ is developed by constructing
interesting auxiliary graphs and employing the cycle cancellation method. As a

Feshbach resonances, by using mean-field theory and a two-channel model that
takes into account explicitly Feshbach molecules in the close channel. In the
absence of spin-orbit coupling, when the channel coupling $g$ between the
closed and open channels is strong, it is widely accepted that the two-channel
model is equivalent to a single-channel model that excludes Feshbach molecules.
This is the so-called broad resonance limit, which is well-satisfied by
ultracold atomic Fermi gases of $^{6}$Li atoms and $^{40}$K atoms in current
experiments. Here, with Rashba spin-orbit coupling we find that the condition
for equivalence becomes much more stringent. As a result, the single-channel
model may already be insufficient to describe properly an atomic Fermi gas of
$^{40}$K atoms at a moderate spin-orbit coupling. We determine a characteristic
channel coupling strength $g_{c}$ as a function of the spin-orbit coupling
strength, above which the single-channel and two-channel models are
approximately equivalent. We also find that for narrow resonance with small
channel coupling, the pairing gap and molecular fraction is strongly suppressed
by SO coupling. Our results can be readily tested in $^{40}$K atoms by using
optical molecular spectroscopy.

variability is caused by interstellar scintillation. We apply this method to
PKS1257-326 to resolve the core-shift as a function of frequency on scales well
below ~12 microarcseconds. We find that the frequency dependence of the
position of the scintillating component is r \propto \nu^{-0.1 \pm 0.24} (99%
confidence interval) and the frequency dependence of the size of the
scintillating component is d \propto \nu^{-0.64 \pm 0.006}. Together, these
results imply that the jet opening angle increases with distance along the jet:
d \propto r^{n_d}$ with n_d > 1.8. We show that the flaring of the jet, and
flat frequency dependence of the core position is broadly consistent with a
model in which the jet is hydrostatically confined and traversing a steep
pressure gradient in the confining medium with p \propto r^{-n_p} and n_p > 7.
Such steep pressure gradients have previously been suggested based on VLBI

relating to Haghverdi and Scott's notion of partially traced categories. The
main result is a representation theorem for such categories: we prove that
every partially traced category can be faithfully embedded in a totally traced
category. Also conversely, every monoidal subcategory of a totally traced
category is partially traced, so this characterizes the partially traced
categories completely. The main technique we use is based on Freyd's
paracategories, along with a partial version of Joyal, Street, and Verity's Int
construction. Along the way, we discuss some new examples of partially traced
categories, mostly arising in the context of quantum computation.
  The second part deals with the construction of categorical models of
higher-order quantum computation. We construct a concrete semantic model of
Selinger and Valiron's quantum lambda calculus, which has been an open problem
until now. We do this by considering presheaf categories over appropriate base
categories arising from first-order quantum computation. The main technical
ingredients are Day's convolution theory and Kelly and Freyd's notion of
continuity of functors. We first give an abstract description of the properties
required of the base categories for the model construction to work; then
exhibit a specific example of base categories satisfying these properties.

Zeta Pup is the X-ray brightest O-type star of the sky. This object
was regularly observed with the RGS instrument aboard XMM-Newton for
calibration purposes, leading to an unprecedented set of high-quality spectra.
Aims. We have previously reduced and extracted this data set and combined it
into the most detailed high-resolution X-ray spectrum of any early-type star so
far. Here we present the analysis of this spectrum accounting for the presence
of structures in the stellar wind. Methods. For this purpose, we use our new
modeling tool that allows fitting the entire spectrum with a multi-temperature
plasma. We illustrate the impact of a proper treatment of the radial dependence
of the X-ray opacity of the cool wind on the best-fit radial distribution of
the temperature of the X-ray plasma. Results. The best fit of the RGS spectrum
of Zeta Pup is obtained assuming no porosity. Four plasma components at
temperatures between 0.10 and 0.69 keV are needed to adequately represent the
observed spectrum. Whilst the hardest emission is concentrated between ~3 and 4
R*, the softer emission starts already at 1.5 R* and extends to the outer
regions of the wind. Conclusions. The inferred radial distribution of the
plasma temperatures agrees rather well with theoretical expectations. The mass-
loss rate and CNO abundances corresponding to our best-fit model also agree
quite well with the results of recent studies of Zeta Pup in the UV and optical
domain.

regret, where regret is the difference between the causal estimation loss of
the estimator and that of the optimum estimator.
  One of the main contributions of this paper is characterizing the minimax
estimator, showing that it is in fact a Bayesian estimator. We then relate
minimax regret to the channel capacity when the channel is either Gaussian or
Poisson. In this case, we characterize the minimax regret and the minimax
estimator more explicitly. If we further assume that the uncertainty set
consists of deterministic signals, the worst case regret is exactly equal to
the corresponding channel capacity, namely the maximal mutual information
attainable across the channel among all possible distributions on the
uncertainty set of signals. The corresponding minimax estimator is the Bayesian
estimator assuming the capacity-achieving prior. Using this relation, we also
show that the capacity achieving prior coincides with the least favorable
input. Moreover, we show that this minimax estimator is not only minimizing the
worst case regret but also essentially minimizing regret for ""most"" of the
other sources in the uncertainty set.

acquired a high quality set of 84 images at 14 epochs of asteroid (52) Europa
on 2005 January 20. The epochs covered its rotation period and, by following
its changing shape and orientation on the plane of sky, we obtained its
triaxial ellipsoid dimensions and spin pole location. An independent
determination from images at three epochs obtained in 2007 is in good agreement
with these results. By combining these two data sets, along with a single epoch
data set obtained in 2003, we have derived a global fit for (52) Europa of
diameters (379x330x249) +/- (16x8x10) km, yielding a volume-equivalent
spherical-diameter of 315 +/- 7 km, and a rotational pole within 7 deg of [RA;
Dec] = [257,+12] in an Equatorial J2000 reference frame (ECJ2000: 255,+35).
Using the average of all mass determinations available forEuropa, we derive a
density of 1.5 +/- 0.4, typical of C-type asteroids. Comparing our images with
the shape model of Michalowski et al. (A&A 416, 2004), derived from optical
lightcurves, illustrates excellent agreement, although several edge features
visible in the images are not rendered by the model. We therefore derived a
complete 3-D description of Europa's shape using the KOALA algorithm by
combining our imaging epochs with 4 stellar occultations and 49 lightcurves. We
use this 3-D shape model to assess these departures from ellipsoidal shape.
Flat facets (possible giant craters) appear to be less distinct on (52) Europa
than on other C-types that have been imaged in detail. We show that fewer giant
craters, or smaller craters, is consistent with its expected impact history.
Overall, asteroid (52) Europa is still well modeled as a smooth triaxial
ellipsoid with dimensions constrained by observations obtained over several
apparitions.

infinite words indexed by $k \in \ints ^+ \cup {+\infty}.$ Let $k \in \ints ^+
\cup {+\infty}$ and $A$ be a finite non-empty set. Two finite words $u$ and $v$
in $A^*$ are said to be $k$-Abelian equivalent if for all $x\in A^*$ of length
less than or equal to $k,$ the number of occurrences of $x$ in $u$ is equal to
the number of occurrences of $x$ in $v.$ This defines a family of equivalence
relations $\thicksim_k$ on $A^*,$ bridging the gap between the usual notion of
Abelian equivalence (when $k=1$) and equality (when $k=+\infty).$ We show that
the number of $k$-Abelian equivalence classes of words of length $n$ grows
polynomially, although the degree is exponential in $k.$ Given an infinite word
$\omega \in A^\nats,$ we consider the associated complexity function $\mathcal
{P}^{(k)}_\omega :\nats \rightarrow \nats$ which counts the number of
$k$-Abelian equivalence classes of factors of $\omega$ of length $n.$ We show
that the complexity function $\mathcal {P}^{(k)}$ is intimately linked with
periodicity. More precisely we define an auxiliary function $q^k: \nats
\rightarrow \nats$ and show that if $\mathcal {P}^{(k)}_{\omega}(n)<q^k(n)$ for
some $k \in \ints ^+ \cup {+\infty}$ and $n\geq 0,$ the $\omega$ is ultimately
periodic. Moreover if $\omega$ is aperiodic, then $\mathcal
{P}^{(k)}_{\omega}(n)=q^k(n)$ if and only if $\omega$ is Sturmian. We also
study $k$-Abelian complexity in connection with repetitions in words. Using
Szemer\'edi's theorem, we show that if $\omega$ has bounded $k$-Abelian
complexity, then for every $D\subset \nats$ with positive upper density and for
every positive integer $N,$ there exists a $k$-Abelian $N$ power occurring in

broadcasting mechanism is at the core of the system design. Despite substantial
efforts on developing efficient broadcasting algorithms, the following
important question remains open: How to achieve the maximum broadcast rate in a
distributed manner with each user maintaining information queues only for its
direct neighbors? In this work, we first derive an innovative formulation of
the problem over acyclic overlay networks with arbitrary underlay capacity
constraints. Then, based on the formulation, we develop a distributed algorithm
to achieve the maximum broadcast rate and every user only maintains one queue
per-neighbor. Due to its lightweight nature, our algorithm scales very well
with the network size and remains robust against high system dynamics. Finally,
by conducting simulations we validate the optimality of our algorithm under
different network capacity models. Simulation results further indicate that the
convergence time of our algorithm grows linearly with the network size, which
suggests an interesting direction for future investigation.

of estimating the radial and circumferential residual stress present in an

mechanical response of arteries. The initial sector is assumed to be unstressed
and the stress distribution resulting from the closure of the sector is then
calculated in the absence of loads on the cylindrical surfaces. Conditions on

uniqueness of the deformed configuration are then examined. Finally, stability
of the resulting finite deformation is analyzed using the theory of incremental
deformations superimposed on the finite deformation, implemented in terms of
the Stroh formulation. The main results are that convexity of the strain energy
as a function of a certain deformation variable ensures existence and
uniqueness of the residually-stressed intact tube, and that bifurcation can
occur in the closing of thick, widely opened sectors, depending on the values

connectivity: the increasing presence of, and interest in, relationships
between data. An example is the Twitter social network graph. Due to this
growth demand is increasing for technologies that can process such data.
Currently relational databases are the predominant technology, but they are
poorly suited to processing connected data as they are optimized for
index-intensive operations. Conversely, graph databases are optimized for graph
computation. They link records by direct references, avoiding index lookups,
and enabling retrieval of adjacent elements in constant time, regardless of
graph size. However, as data volume increases these databases outgrow the
resources of one computer and data partitioning becomes necessary. We evaluate
the viability of using graph partitioning algorithms to partition graph
databases. A prototype partitioned database was developed. Three partitioning
algorithms explored and one implemented. Three graph datasets were used: two
real and one synthetically generated. These were partitioned in various ways
and the impact on database performance measured. We defined one synthetic
access pattern per dataset and executed each on the partitioned datasets.
Evaluation took place in a simulation environment, ensuring repeatability and
allowing measurement of metrics like network traffic and load balance. Results
show that compared to random partitioning the partitioning algorithm reduced
traffic by 40-90%. Executing the algorithm intermittently during usage
maintained partition quality, while requiring only 1% the computation of
initial partitioning. Strong correlations were found between theoretic quality
metrics and generated network traffic under non-uniform access patterns.

associated with two Gaussian random walks: the first walk represents the
initial overdensity around a protohalo, and the second is a crude way of
allowing for other factors which might influence halo formation. This model is
richer than that based on a single walk, because it yields a distribution of
heights at first crossing. We provide explicit expressions for the
unconditional first crossing distribution which is usually used to model the
halo mass function, the progenitor distributions, and the conditional
distributions from which correlations with environment are usually estimated.
These latter exhibit perhaps the simplest form of what is often called nonlocal
bias, and which we prefer to call stochastic bias, since the new bias effects
arise from `hidden-variables' other than density, but these may still be
defined locally. We provide explicit expressions for these new bias factors. We
also provide formulae for the distribution of heights at first crossing in the
unconditional and conditional cases. In contrast to the first crossing
distribution, these are exact, even for moving barriers, and for walks with
correlated steps. The conditional distributions yield predictions for the
distribution of halo concentrations at fixed mass and formation redshift. They
also exhibit assembly bias like effects, even when the steps in the walks
themselves are uncorrelated. Finally, we show how the predictions are modified
if we add the requirement that halos form around peaks: these depend on whether
the peaks constraint is applied to a combination of the overdensity and the
other variable, or to the overdensity alone. Our results demonstrate the power
of requiring models to reproduce not just halo counts but the distribution of
overdensities at fixed protohalo mass as well.

ADCC-GJR-GARCH model takes into consideration the asymmetries in individual
assets' volatilities, as well as in the correlations. The errors are modeled
using a Dirichlet location-scale mixture of multivariate Gaussian distributions
allowing for a great flexibility in the return distribution in terms of
skewness and kurtosis. Model estimation and prediction are developed using MCMC
methods based on slice sampling techniques. We carry out a simulation study to
illustrate the flexibility of the proposed approach. We find that the proposed
DPM model is able to adapt to several frequently used distribution models and
also accurately estimates the posterior distribution of the volatilities of the
returns, without assuming any underlying distribution. Finally, we present a
financial application using Apple and NASDAQ Industrial index data to solve a
portfolio allocation problem. We find that imposing a restrictive parametric
distribution can result into underestimation of the portfolio variance, whereas
DPM model is able to overcome this problem.

recording system, with formal time resolution of 16 ns. The total observing
time was about 4.5 hours; the rate of detection of GPs was about 130 per hour
at the average longitudes of the main pulse (MPGPs) and 60 per hour at the
interpulse (IPGPs). While the average profile shows well-defined polarization
behavior, with regular evolution of the linear polarization position angle
(PA), GPs exhibit random properties, occasionally having high linear or
circular polarization. Neither MPGPs nor IPGPs show a preferred PA. The
cumulative probability distribution (CPD) of GP pulse energy was constructed
down to the level where GPs merge with regular pulses and noise. For both MPGPs
and IPGPs, the CPD follows a power law with a break, the power index changing
from -2.4 at high energy to -1.6 for low energy. Pulse smearing due to
scattering masks the intrinsic shape and duration of the detected GPs. The
smearing time varied during the observing session within a range of a few
hundred nanoseconds. The measured polarization and statistical properties of
GPs impose strong constraints on physical models of GPs. Some of these
properties support a model in which GPs are generated by the electric discharge
caused by magnetic reconnection of field lines connecting the opposite magnetic

asymptotically safe theory on this hitherto unexplored theory space is
investigated. In principle Asymptotic Safety of metric gravity (at least at the
level of the effective average action) is neither necessary nor sufficient for
Asymptotic Safety on the Einstein-Cartan theory space which might accommodate

state-dependent 3-receiver broadcast channels. In the proposed model, there are
two legitimate receivers, an eavesdropper and a transmitter where the channel
state information is non-causally available at the transmitter. We consider two
setups. In the first setup, the transmitter tries to agree on a common key with
the legitimate receivers while keeping it concealed from the eavesdropper.
Simultaneously, the transmitter agrees on a private key with each of the
legitimate receivers that needs to be kept secret from the other legitimate
receiver and the eavesdropper. For this setup, we derive inner and outer bounds
on the secret key capacity region. In the second setup, we assume that a
backward public channel is available among the receivers and the transmitter.
Each legitimate receiver wishes to share a private key with the transmitter.
For this setup, an inner bound on the private key capacity region is found.
Furthermore, the capacity region of the secret key in the state-dependent
wiretap channel can be deduced from our inner and outer bounds.

this study, we explored if generation and cycle-by-cycle control of
Drosophila's wingbeat are functionally separated, or if the steering muscles
instead couple into the myogenic rhythm as a weak forcing of a limit cycle
oscillator. We behaviourally tested tethered flying flies for characteristic
properties of limit cycle oscillators. To this end, we mechanically stimulated
the fly's gyroscopic organs, the halteres, and determined the phase
relationship between the wing motion and stimulus. The flies synchronized with
the stimulus for specific ranges of stimulus amplitude and frequency, revealing
the characteristic Arnold tongues of a forced limit cycle oscillator. Rapid
periodic modulation of the wingbeat frequency prior to locking demonstrates the
involvement of the fast steering muscles in the observed control of the

cycle oscillator permits flies to avoid the comparatively slow control based on
a neural central pattern generator.

plasmons by defects in the graphene sheet they propagate in. These defects can
be either natural (as domain boundaries, ripples and cracks, among others) or
induced by an external gate. The scattering is shown to be governed by an
integral equation, derived from a plane wave expansion of the fields, which in
general must be solved numerically but it provides useful analytical results
for small defects. Two main cases are considered: smooth variations of the
graphene conductivity (characterized by a Gaussian conductivity profile) and
sharp variations (represented by islands with different conductivity). In
general, reflection largely dominates over radiation out of the graphene sheet.
However, in the case of sharply defined conductivity islands there are some
values of island size and frequency where the reflectance vanishes and,
correspondingly, the radiation out of plane is the main scattering process. For
smooth defects, the reflectance spectra present a single maximum at the
condition $k_p a \approx \sqrt{2}$, where $k_p$ is the GSP wavevector and $a$
the spatial width of the defect. In contrast, the reflectance spectra of sharp
defects present periodic oscillations with period $k_p' a$, where $k_p'$ is the
GSP wavelength inside the defect. Finally, the case of cracks (gaps in the
graphene conductivity) is considered, showing that the reflectance is
practically unity for gap widths larger than one tenth of the GSP wavelength.

fountains on the chemical enrichment of the M31 disk. We find that the landing
coordinate for the fountains in M31 is no more than 1 kpc from the starting
point, thus producing negligible effect on the chemical evolution of the disk.
We find that the delay time in the enrichment process due to fountains is no
longer than 100 Myr and this timescale also produces negligible effects on the
results. Then, we compute the chemical evolution of the M31 disk with radial
gas flows produced by the infall of extragalactic material and fountains. We
find that a moderate inside-out formation of the disk coupled with radial flows
of variable speed can very well reproduce the observed gradient. We discuss
also the effects of other parameters such a threshold in the gas density for
star formation and an efficiency of star formation varying with the galactic
radius. We conclude that the most important physical processes in creating disk
gradients are the inside-out formation and the radial gas flows. More data on
abundance gradients both locally and at high redshift are necessary to confirm

is simply to minimize the negative log-likelihood of the hidden path, where the
likelihood is expressed relative to Wiener measure. This negative
log-likelihood is the action integral of the path, which we minimize by
calculus of variations. We then perform an asymptotic maximum-likelihood
analysis to understand better how the actual path is distributed around the
least-action path; it turns out that the actual path can be expressed
(approximately) as the sum of the least-action path and a zero-mean Gaussian
process which can be specified quite explicitly. Numerical solution of the ODEs

complicated by the shooting nature of the problem, and the possibility that we
have found a local but not global minimum. We analyze the situations when this

characterized by several structural and dynamical properties remarkably similar
to those of observed elliptical galaxies. Are these properties a peculiarity of
the Newtonian force or a more general feature of long-range forces? We study
this problem by means of $N-$body simulations of dissipationless collapse of
systems of particles interacting via additive $r^{-\alpha}$ forces. We find
that most of the results holding in Newtonian gravity are also valid for
$\alpha\neq2$. In particular the end products are triaxial and never flatter
than an E7 system, their surface density profiles are well described by the
S\'ersic law, the global density slope-anisotropy inequality is obeyed, the
differential energy distribution is an exponential over a large range of
energies (for $\alpha\geq1$), and the pseudo phase-space density is a power law
of radius. In addition, we show that the process of virialization takes longer
(in units of the system's dynamical time) for decreasing values of $\alpha$,
and becomes infinite for $\alpha=-1$ (the harmonic oscillator). This is in
agreement with the results of deep-MOND collapses (qualitatively corresponding
to $\alpha=1$) and it is due to the fact the force becomes more and more
similar to the $\alpha=-1$ case, where as well known no relaxation can happen
and the system oscillates forever.

turbulent friction drag, which is an important source of energy waste in
innumerable technological fields. We develop a theoretical framework aimed at
predicting the behaviour of existing drag reduction techniques when used at the
large values of Re which are typical of applications. We focus on one recently
proposed and very promising technique, which consists in creating at the wall
streamwise-travelling waves of spanwise velocity. A perturbation analysis of
the Navier-Stokes equations that govern the fluid motion is carried out, for
the simplest wall-bounded flow geometry, i.e. the plane channel flow. The
streamwise base flow is perturbed by the spanwise time-varying base flow
induced by the travelling waves. An asymptotic expansion is then carried out
with respect to the velocity amplitude of the travelling wave. The analysis,
although based on several assumptions, leads to predictions of drag reduction
that agree well with the measurements available in literature and mostly
computed through DNS of the full Navier-Stokes equations. New DNS data are
produced on purpose in this work to validate our method further. The method is
then applied to predict the drag-reducing performance of the
streamwise-travelling waves at increasing Re, where comparison data are not
available. The current belief, based on a Re-range of about one decade only
above the transitional value, that drag reduction obtained at low Re is deemed
to decrease as Re is increased is fully confirmed by our results. From a
quantitative standpoint, however, our outlook based on several decades of
increase in Re is much less pessimistic than other existing estimates, and
motivates further, more accurate studies on the present subject.

probability distribution from a finite number of samples. For a specific
observed data set, answers to the following questions would be desirable: (1)
Estimation: Which candidate distribution provides the best fit to the observed
data?, (2) Goodness-of-fit: How concordant is this distribution with the
observed data?, and (3) Uncertainty: How concordant are other candidate
distributions with the observed data? A simple unified approach for univariate
data that addresses these traditionally distinct statistical notions is
presented called ""maximum fidelity"". Maximum fidelity is a strict frequentist
approach that is fundamentally based on model concordance with the observed
data. The fidelity statistic is a general information measure based on the
coordinate-independent cumulative distribution and critical yet previously
neglected symmetry considerations. An approximation for the null distribution
of the fidelity allows its direct conversion to absolute model concordance (p
value). Fidelity maximization allows identification of the most concordant
model distribution, generating a method for parameter estimation, with
neighboring, less concordant distributions providing the ""uncertainty"" in this
estimate. Maximum fidelity provides an optimal approach for parameter
estimation (superior to maximum likelihood) and a generally optimal approach
for goodness-of-fit assessment of arbitrary models applied to univariate data.
Extensions to binary data, binned data, multidimensional data, and classical
parametric and nonparametric statistical tests are described. Maximum fidelity
provides a philosophically consistent, robust, and seemingly optimal foundation
for statistical inference. All findings are presented in an elementary way to
be immediately accessible to all researchers utilizing statistical analysis.

occurrence of non-Gaussian density fluctuations. In their original work, CT
considered several other shapes, and suggested that only for one of those does
the impact of non-Gaussianity seem to be perturbatively tractable. For that
model, and on galactic scales, the next-to-linear non-Gaussian contribution to
the angular momentum variance has an upper limit of $\sim 10%$ with respect to
the linear one. I find that all the new models considered in this work can also
be seemingly described via perturbation theory. Considering current bounds on
$f_\mathrm{NL}$ for inflationary non-Gaussianity leads to the quasi-linear

evolution of systems jumping from a metastable sub-set of their configuration
space, or trap, to another via rare intermittent events. The multi-scaled
behavior typical of complex dynamics is provided by a fat-tailed distribution
of the waiting time between consecutive jumps. We first argue that CTRW are
inadequate to describe macroscopic relaxation processes for three reasons:
macroscopic variables are not self-averaging, memory effects require an
all-knowing observer,and different mechanisms whereby the jumps affect
macroscopic variables all produce identical long time relaxation behaviors.
Hence, CTRW shed no light on the link between microscopic and macroscopic
dynamics. We then highlight how a more recent approach, Record Dynamics (RD)
provides a viable alternative, based on a very different set of physical ideas:
while CTRW make use of a renewal process involving identical traps of infinite
size, RD embodies a dynamical entrenchment into a hierarchy of traps which are
finite in size and possess different degrees of meta-stability. We show in
particular how RD produces the stretched exponential, power-law and logarithmic
relaxation behaviors ubiquitous in complex dynamics, together with the
sub-diffusive time dependence of the Mean Square Displacement characteristic of
single particles moving in a complex environment.

1914 has a NE-SW elongated structure with two galaxy clumps, that mostly merge
in the plane of the sky. Our best, but very uncertain estimate of the velocity
dispersion of the main system is sigma_v~1000 km/s. We estimate a virial mass
M_sys=1.4--2.6 10^{15} h_{70}^{-1} Msun for the whole system. We study the
merger through a simple two-body model and find that data are consistent with a
bound, outgoing substructure observed just after the core crossing. By studying
the 2D distribution of the red galaxies, photometrically selected, we show that
Abell 1914 is contained in a rich large scale structure, with two close
companion galaxy systems, known to be at z~0.17. The system at SW supports the
idea that the cluster is accreting groups from a filament aligned in the NE-SW
direction, while that at NW suggests a second direction of the accretion NW-SE.
We conclude that Abell 1914 well fits among typical clusters with radio halos.
We argue that the unusual radio emission is connected to the complex cluster
accretion and suggest that Abell 1914 resembles the well-known nearby merging
cluster Abell 754 for its particular observed phenomenology.

theory the variational problem is generically not well-posed given only a
boundary condition for the metric. However, when one evaluates the higher
derivative terms perturbatively on a leading order Einstein solution, the
equations of motion are always second order and therefore the variational
problem indeed requires only a boundary condition for the metric. The equations
of motion required to compute the spectrum around the corrected background are
still generically higher order, with the additional boundary conditions being
associated with new operators in the dual conformal field theory. We discuss
which higher derivative curvature invariants are expected to arise in the
four-dimensional action from a top-down perspective and compute the corrections
to planar AdS black holes and to the spectrum around AdS in various cases.
Requiring that the dual theory is unitary strongly constrains the higher
derivative terms in the action, as the operators associated with the extra
boundary conditions generically have complex conformal dimensions and
non-positive norms.

Gutzwiller-projected spin Hall state. The in-plane substitution of Zn$^{2+}$
and Li$^{+}$ for Cu$^{2+}$ brings zero modes around the spin vacancy. The
Gutzwiller projection precludes single particle excitations, however, preserves
the zero modes which have a local spin moment for Zn$^{2+}$ and a local charged
hole for Li$^{+}$, respectively. While the local spin moment for Zn$^{2+}$ is
screened by the long-range spin correlations, the active charge degree of
freedom for Li$^{+}$ impurity twists the spin background with long ranged
disturbances. This proposal explains the very different roles of the Zn$^{2+}$
and Li$^{+}$ impurities on the magnetic perturbations in the CuO$_2$ plane in
the undoped cuprate compounds.

Regularity problems for elliptic operators with $t$-independent complex bounded

To be precise, we show that the Dirichlet boundary value problem is solvable in
$L^{p'}$, subject to the square function and non-tangential maximal function
estimates, if and only if the corresponding Regularity problem is solvable in
$L^p$. Moreover, the solutions admit layer potential representations.
  In particular, we prove that for any elliptic operator with $t$-independent
real (possibly non-symmetric) coefficients there exists a $p>1$ such that the
Regularity problem is well-posed in $L^p$.

play an important role for plasma heating. The study of waves in the solar
corona is usually based on linear ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) for a fully
ionized plasma. However, the plasma in the photosphere and the chromosphere is
only partially ionized. Here we investigate theoretically the impact of partial
ionization on MHD wave propagation in cylindrical flux tubes in the two-fluid
model. We derive the general dispersion relation that takes into account the
effects of neutral-ion collisions and the neutral gas pressure. We take the
neutral-ion collision frequency as an arbitrary parameter. Particular results
for transverse kink modes and slow magnetoacoustic modes are shown. We find
that the wave frequencies only depend on the properties of the ionized fluid
when the neutral-ion collision frequency is much lower that the wave frequency.
For high collision frequencies realistic of the solar atmosphere ions and
neutrals behave as a single fluid with an effective density corresponding to
the sum of densities of both fluids and an effective sound velocity computed as
the average of the sound velocities of ions and neutrals. The MHD wave
frequencies are modified accordingly. The neutral gas pressure can be neglected
when studying transverse kink waves but it has to be taken into account for a
consistent description of slow magnetoacoustic waves. The MHD waves are damped
due to neutral-ion collisions. The damping is most efficient when the wave
frequency and the collision frequency are of the same order of magnitude. For
high collision frequencies slow magnetoacoustic waves are more efficiently
damped than transverse kink waves. In addition, we find the presence of
cut-offs for certain combinations of parameters that cause the waves to become
non-propagating.

  results","21 pages, 9 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.87.174419",,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are single-domain and magnetically
independent, their magnetic properties and the conditions to optimize their
efficiency in magnetic hyperthermia applications are now well-understood.
However, the influence of magnetic interactions on magnetic hyperthermia
properties is still unclear. Here, we report hyperthermia and high-frequency
hysteresis loop measurements on a model system consisting of MNPs with the same
size but a varying anisotropy, which is an interesting way to tune the relative
strength of magnetic interactions. A clear correlation between the MNP
anisotropy and the squareness of their hysteresis loop in colloidal solution is
observed : the larger the anisotropy, the smaller the squareness. Since low
anisotropy MNPs display a squareness higher than the one of magnetically
independent nanoparticles, magnetic interactions enhance their heating power in
this case. Hysteresis loop calculations of independent and coupled MNPs are
compared to experimental results. It is shown that the observed features are a
natural consequence of the formation of chains and columns of MNPs during
hyperthermia experiments: in these structures, when the MNP magnetocristalline
anisotropy is small enough to be dominated by magnetic interactions, the
hysteresis loop shape tends to be rectangular, which enhance their efficiency.
On the contrary, when MNPs do not form chains and columns, magnetic
interactions reduces the hysteresis loop squareness and the efficiency of MNPs
compared to independent ones. The present work should improve the understanding
and interpretation of magnetic hyperthermia experiments.

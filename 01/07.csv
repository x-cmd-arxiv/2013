molecular and cellular basis of behaviour in a variety of model organisms with
unprecedented detail and scope. It is increasingly routine to isolate
behavioural mutants, clone and characterise mutant genes, and discern the
molecular and neural basis for a behavioural phenotype. Conversely, reverse
genetic approaches have made it possible to straightforwardly identify genes of
interest in whole-genome sequences and generate mutants that can be subjected
to phenotypic analysis. In this latter approach, it is the phenotyping that
presents the major bottleneck; when it comes to connecting phenotype to
genotype in freely behaving animals, analysis of behaviour itself remains
superficial and time consuming. However, many proof-of-principle studies of
automated behavioural analysis over the last decade have poised the field on
the verge of exciting developments that promise to begin closing this gap.
  In the broadest sense, our goal in this chapter is to explore what we can
learn about the genes involved in neural function by carefully observing
behaviour. This approach is rooted in model organism genetics but shares ideas
with ethology and neuroscience, as well as computer vision and bioinformatics.
After introducing C. elegans as a model, we will survey the research that has
led to the current state of the art in worm behavioural phenotyping and present
current research that is transforming our approach to behavioural genetics.

Therefore, prior information on the signal is needed in order to enable its
recovery. In this work we consider the case in which the signal is known to be
sparse, i.e., it consists of a small number of nonzero elements in an
appropriate basis. We propose a fast local search method for recovering a
sparse signal from measurements of its Fourier transform (or other linear

combinatorial and permits to recover an error $e$ of rank weight $r$ in

O((n-k)^3m^3q^{(r-1)\lfloor\frac{(k+1)m}{n}\rfloor}))$ operations on $GF(q)$.
This attack dramatically improves on previous attack by introducing the length
$n$ of the code in the exponent of the complexity, which was not the case in
previous generic attacks. which can be considered The second attack is based on
a algebraic attacks: based on the theory of $q$-polynomials introduced by Ore
we propose a new algebraic setting for the RSD problem that permits to consider
equations and unknowns in the extension field $GF(q^m)$ rather than in $GF(q)$
as it is usually the case. We consider two approaches to solve the problem in
this new setting. Linearization technics show that if $n \ge (k+1)(r+1)-1$ the
RSD problem can be solved in polynomial time, more generally we prove that if
$\lceil \frac{(r+1)(k+1)-(n+1)}{r} \rceil \le k$, the problem can be solved
with an average complexity $O(r^3k^3q^{r\lceil \frac{(r+1)(k+1)-(n+1)}{r}
\rceil})$. We also consider solving with \grob bases for which which we discuss
theoretical complexity, we also consider consider hybrid solving with \grob
bases on practical parameters. As an example of application we use our new
attacks on all proposed recent cryptosystems which reparation the GPT
cryptosystem, we break all examples of published proposed parameters, some
parameters are broken in less than 1 s in certain cases.

cross-correlate the ACT and the South Pole Telescope (SPT) maps and show they

help constrain extensions beyond the standard model. The small angular scale
power spectrum also provides constraining power on the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich

it to that estimated from mock catalogues extracted from the LasDamas (a LCDM

LasDamas cosmology at ~ 1.5 sigma CL. We also show that our Mach estimates for
the mocks are not biased by selection function effects. To achieve this, we
extract dense and nearly-isotropic distributions using Gaussian selection
functions with the same width as the characteristic depth of the real surveys,
and show that the Mach numbers estimated from the mocks are very similar to the

properties different than others was suspected to be a Supernova Remnant (SNR),

scale dynamics of a galaxy but occurs on the small scale of an individual star
forming event. This paper presents the first numerical simulations to resolve
the star formation process on sub-parsec scales, whilst also following the
dynamics of the interstellar medium (ISM) on galactic scales. In these models,
the warm low density ISM gas flows into the spiral arms where orbit crowding
produces the shock formation of dense clouds, held together temporarily by
their external pressure. Cooling allows the gas to be compressed to
sufficiently high densities that local regions collapse under their own gravity
and form stars. The star formation rates follow a Schmidt-Kennicutt
\Sigma_{SFR} ~ \Sigma_{gas}^{1.4} type relation with the local surface density
of gas while following a linear relation with the cold and dense gas. Cooling
is the primary driver of star formation and the star formation rates as it
determines the amount of cold gas available for gravitational collapse. The
star formation rates found in the simulations are offset to higher values
relative to the extragalactic values, implying a constant reduction, such as
from feedback or magnetic fields, is likely to be required. Intriguingly, it
appears that a spiral or other convergent shock and the accompanying thermal
instability can explain how star formation is triggered, generate the physical
conditions of molecular clouds and explain why star formation rates are tightly
correlated to the gas properties of galaxies.

Iax), after SN 2002cx. We show that the population properties of this class can
be understood if the events originate from helium double-detonation
sub-Chandrasekhar mass explosions, in which a carbon--oxygen white dwarf (CO
WD) accumulates a helium layer from a non-degenerate helium star. We have
incorporated detailed binary evolution calculations for the progenitor systems
into a binary population synthesis model to obtain birthrates and delay times
for such events. The predicted Galactic event rate is $\sim$$0.6-1.8\times
10^{-3}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, in good agreement with the measured rates of SNe Iax.
In addition, predicted delay times are $\sim$70\,Myr$-$710\,Myr, consistent
with the fact that SNe Iax have so far only been discovered in late-type
galaxies. Based on the CO WD mass at explosion and previous detonation models,
we also estimate the distribution of resulting SN brightness ($-13 \gtrsim
M_{\rm bol} \gtrsim -19$ mag), which can reproduce the empirical diversity of
SNe Iax. We speculate on why binaries with non-degenerate donor stars might
lead to SNe Iax if similar systems with degenerate donors do not and suggest
that the higher mass of the helium layer necessary for ignition at the lower
accretion rates typically delivered from non-degenerate donors might provide
the explanation.

heterostructure with a bridge width range of 1.5-10 microns. Upon applying
back-gate voltage of the order of a few Volts, a strong increase in the sample
resistance (up to factor of 35) is observed, suggesting a relatively large
capacitance between the Hall-bar and the gate. The high value of this
capacitance is due to the device geometry, and can be explained within an
electrostatic model using the Thomas Fermi approximation. The Hall coefficient
is sometimes a non-monotonic function of the gate voltage. This behavior is
inconsistent with a single conduction band model. We show that a theoretical
two-band model is consistent with this transport behavior, and indicates a
metal to insulator transition in at least one of these bands.

of the Trojan asteroids occupying Jupiter's L4 and L5 Lagrange points as a
priority for future NASA missions. Observing these asteroids and measuring
their physical characteristics and composition would aid in identification of
their source and provide answers about their likely impact history and
evolution, thus yielding information about the makeup and dynamics of the early
Solar System. We present a conceptual design for a mission to the Jovian Trojan
asteroids: the Trojan ASteroid Tour, Exploration, and Rendezvous (TASTER)
mission, that is consistent with the NASA New Frontiers candidate mission
recommended by the Decadal Survey and the final result of the 2011 NASA-JPL
Planetary Science Summer School. Our proposed mission includes visits to two
Trojans in the L4 population: a 500 km altitude fly-by of 1999 XS143, followed
by a rendezvous with and detailed observations of 911 Agamemnon at orbital
altitudes of 1000 - 100 km over a 12 month nominal science data capture period.
Our proposed instrument payload - wide- and narrow-angle cameras, a visual and
infrared mapping spectrometer, and a neutron/gamma ray spectrometer - would
provide unprecedented high-resolution, regional-to-global datasets for the
target bodies, yielding fundamental information about the early history and
evolution of the Solar System. Although our mission design was completed as
part of an academic exercise, this study serves as a useful starting point for
future Trojan mission design studies. In particular, we identify and discuss
key issues that can make large differences in the complex trade-offs required
when designing a mission to the Trojan asteroids.

fixed length of the lines is considered, and the aim of the control system is
to obtain figure-eight crosswind trajectories. The proposed technique is based
on the notion of the wing's ""velocity angle"" and, in contrast with most
existing approaches, it does not require a measurement of the wind speed or of
the effective wind at the wing's location. Moreover, the proposed approach
features few parameters, whose effects on the system's behavior are very
intuitive, hence simplifying tuning procedures. A simplified model of the
steering dynamics of the wing is derived from first-principle laws, compared
with experimental data and used for the control design. The control algorithm
is divided into a low-level loop for the velocity angle and a high-level
guidance strategy to achieve the desired flight patterns. The robustness of the
inner loop is verified analytically, and the overall control system is tested
experimentally on a small-scale prototype, with varying wind conditions and
using different wings.

present we concentrate on the cases $\alpha =1$ and 2, for which exact
solutions in terms of well known functions are available for comparison. We
classify the classical paths in this system by their qualitative nature and
calculate the contributions of the various classes to the leading-order
semiclassical approximation: For each classical path we find the action $S$,
the amplitude function $A$ and the Laplacian of $A$. (The Laplacian is of
interest because it gives an estimate of the error in the approximation and is
needed for computing higher-order approximations.) The resulting semiclassical
propagator can be used to rewrite the exact problem as a Volterra integral
equation, whose formal solution by iteration (Neumann series) is a
semiclassical, not perturbative, expansion. We thereby test, in the context of
a concrete problem, the validity of the two technical hypotheses in a previous
proof of the convergence of such a Neumann series in the more abstract setting
of an arbitrary smooth potential. Not surprisingly, we find that the hypotheses
are violated when caustics develop in the classical dynamics; this opens up the
interesting future project of extending the methods to momentum space.

high performance computing and grid computing environments. For MapReduce
environments, existing methods to compute the QR decomposition use a
numerically unstable approach that relies on indirectly computing the Q factor.
In the best case, these methods require only two passes over the data. In this

an existence and uniqueness result for the spacetime arising from such data and
show that the resulting spacetime represents the interaction of two impulsive
gravitational waves germinating from the initial singularities. In the
spacetime, the curvature delta singularities propagate along 3-dimensional null
hypersurfaces intersecting to the future of the data. To the past of the
intersection, the spacetime can be thought of as containing two independent,
non-interacting impulsive gravitational waves and the intersection represents
the first instance of their nonlinear interaction. Our analysis extends to the
region past their first interaction and shows that the spacetime still remains
smooth away from the continuing propagating individual waves. The construction
of these spacetimes are motivated in part by the celebrated explicit solutions
of Khan-Penrose and Szekeres. The approach of this paper can be applied to an

radiation or enhancing the transition rate of a quantum emitter. Slot-type
magnetic-dipole nanoantennas, which are complementary structures of typical
electric-dipole-type antennas, have received little attention, leaving their
antenna properties largely unexplored. Here we present a novel
magnetic-dipole-fed multi-slot optical Yagi-Uda antenna. By engineering the
relative phase of the interacting surface plasmon polaritons between the slot

unidirectional radiation to free space. The unique features of the slot-based
magnetic nanoantenna provide a new possibility of achieving integrated features
such as energy transfer from one waveguide to another by working as a future

model of growth with cycles by assuming that the individual income distribution
of the Brazilian society is described by the Gompertz-Pareto distribution
(GPD). This is formed by the combination of the Gompertz curve, representing
the overwhelming majority of the population (~99%), with the Pareto power law,
representing the tiny richest part (~1%). In line with Goodwin's original
model, we identify the Gompertzian part with the workers and the Paretian
component with the class of capitalists. Since the GPD parameters are obtained
for each year and the Goodwin macroeconomics is a time evolving model, we use
previously determined, and further extended here, Brazilian GPD parameters, as
well as unemployment data, to study the time evolution of these quantities in
Brazil from 1981 to 2009 by means of the Goodwin dynamics. This is done in the
original Goodwin model and an extension advanced by Desai et al. (2006). As far
as Brazilian data is concerned, our results show partial qualitative and
quantitative agreement with both models in the studied time period, although
the original one provides better data fit. Nevertheless, both models fall short
of a good empirical agreement as they predict single center cycles which were
not found in the data. We discuss the specific points where the Goodwin
dynamics must be improved in order to provide a more realistic representation
of the dynamics of economic systems.

several kV/cm) on the surface of topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$, where the
electron-surface optical phonon scattering dominates except at very low
temperature. Due to the spin mixing of conduction and valence bands, the
electric field not only accelerates electrons in each band, but also leads to
inter-band precession. In the presence of the electric field, electrons can
transfer from the valence band to the conduction one via the inter-band
precession and inter-band electron-phonon scattering. The electron density in
each band varies with the electric field linearly when the electric field is
strong. Due to the spin-momentum locking, a transverse spin polarization, with
the magnitude proportional to the momentum scattering time, is induced by the
electric field. The induced spin polarization depends on the electric field
linearly when the latter is small. Moreover, its magnitude is inversely
proportional to the temperature and is insensitive to the electron density at
high temperature. Our investigation also reveals that due to the large relative
static dielectric constant, the Coulomb scattering is too weak to establish a
drifted Fermi distribution with a unified hot-electron temperature in the
steady state under the electric field. After turning off the electric field in
the steady state, the hot carriers cool down in a time scale of energy
relaxation which is very long (of the order of 100-1000 ps) while the spin
polarization relaxes in a time scale of momentum scattering which is quite

necessary neutral pion rejection to make a prompt photon measurement feasible

photons at forward rapidities are optimally sensitive to the gluon distribution
because, unlike pions, direct photons are only produced by processes that are
directly sensitive to the gluon distribution at leading order. A measurement of

of edge-disjoint spanning trees contained in $G$. Let $k\geq 1$ be a fixed
integer. Palmer and Spencer proved that in almost every random graph process,
the hitting time for having $k$ edge-disjoint spanning trees equals the hitting
time for having minimum degree $k$. In this paper, we prove that for any $p$
such that $(\log n+\omega(1))/n\leq p\leq (1.1\log n)/n$, almost surely the
random graph $G(n,p)$ satisfies that the spanning tree packing number is equal
to the minimum degree. Note that this bound for $p$ will allow the minimum
degree to be a function of $n$, and in this sense we improve the result of
Palmer and Spencer. Moreover, we also obtain that for any $p$ such that $p\geq

0.01 - 10 M_{\sun} s^{-1} is a plausible candidate for the central engine of
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). This hyperaccretion disk is optically thin to
neutrinos in the radial direction, therefore the neutrinos produced at one
radius can travel for a long distance in the disk. Those neutrinos can thus be
absorbed with certain probability by the disk matter at the other radius and
heat the disk there. The effect of this ""global neutrino heating"" has been
ignored in previous works and is the focus of this paper. We find that around
the ""ignition"" radius r_{ign}, the global neutrino heating rate could be
comparable to or even larger than the local viscous heating rate thus must be
an important process. Two possible consequences are in order if the ""global
neutrino heating"" is taken into account: i) the temperature of the disk is
slightly raised and the ""ignition"" radius r_{ign} slightly shifts to a larger
radius, both lead to the increasing of the total neutrino flux; ii) what is
more interesting is that, the temperature of the ADAF just beyond r_{ign} may
be raised above the virial temperature thus the accretion will be suppressed.
In this case, the activity of the black hole is expected to oscillate between
an active and inactive phases. The timescale of the active phases is estimated
to be \sim 1 second. If the timescale of the inactive phase is comparable to or
less than this value, this intermittent activity may explain the slow
variability component of the GRBs. Self-consistent global calculations of NDAFs
with the ""global neutrino heating"" included are required in the future to more
precisely evaluate this effect.

estimates this value by solving a consistent linear least-squares problem with

method, the forward error tends to concentrate in the direction of a right
singular vector corresponding to \sigma_{\min}. Extensive experiments show that
the method is able to estimate well the condition number of a wide array of

requirements. The method uses very little memory (it inherits this property
from LSQR) and it works equally well on square and rectangular matrices.

and strong energy dependent pulse profiles were clearly detected up to ~100
keV. Narrow dips are seen in the profiles up to ~70 keV. Presence of prominent
dips at several phases in the profiles up to such high energy ranges were not
seen before. At higher energies, these dips gradually disappeared and the
profile appeared single-peaked. The 1.0-200.0 keV broad-band spectrum is found
to be well described by a partial covering high energy cut-off power-law model.
Several low energy emission lines are also detected in the pulsar spectrum. We
fitted the spectrum using neutral as well as partially ionized absorbers along
with above continuum model yielding similar parameter values. The partial
covering with partially ionized absorber resulted into marginally better fit.
The spectral fitting did not require any cyclotron feature in the best fit
model. To investigate the changes in spectral parameters at dips, we carried
out pulse-phase-resolved spectroscopy. During the dips, the value of additional
column density was estimated to be high compared to other pulse phases. While
using partially ionized absorber, the value of ionization parameter is also
higher at the dips. This may be the reason for the presence of dips up to
higher energies. No other spectral parameters show any systematic variation
with pulse phases of the pulsar.

adiabatic evolution algorithms for solving a particular class of quantum search
problems where both the initial and final Hamiltonian are one-dimensional
projector Hamiltonians on the corresponding ground state. If the overlap
between the initial state and final state of the quantum system is not equal to
zero, both of these models can provide a constant time speedup over the usual
adiabatic algorithms by increasing some another corresponding ""complexity"". But
when the initial state has a zero overlap with the solution state in the
problem, the second model leads to an infinite time complexity of the algorithm
for whatever interpolating functions being applied while the first one can
still provide a constant running time. However, inspired by a related
reference, a variant of the first model can be constructed which also fails for
the problem when the overlap is exactly equal to zero if we want to make up the
""intrinsic"" fault of the second model-an increase in energy. Two concrete
theorems are given to serve as explanations why neither of these two models can
improve the usual adiabatic evolution algorithms for the phenomenon above.
These just tell us what should be noted when using certain nonlinear evolution
paths in adiabatic quantum algorithms for some special kind of problems.

[M(tmdt)2] (M= Ni, Au, and Cu) are theoretically studied. By considering
fragments of molecular orbitals as basis functions, we construct a multiorbital
model common for the three materials. The tight-binding parameters are
estimated from results of first-principles band calculations, leading to a
systematic view of their electronic structures. We find that the interplay
between a p\pi-type orbital (L) on each of the two ligands and a pd\sigma-type
orbital (M\sigma) centered on the metal site plays a crucial role: their energy
difference controls the electronic states near the Fermi energy. For the
magnetic materials (M= Au and Cu), we take into account Coulomb interactions on
different orbitals, i.e., we consider the multiorbital Hubbard model. Its
ground-state properties are calculated within mean-field approximation where
various types of magnetic structures with different orbital natures are found.
An explanation for the experimental results in [Cu(tmdt)2] is provided: The
quasi-degeneracy of the two types of orbitals leads to a dual state where
localized M$\sigma$ spins appear, and L sites show a nonmagnetic state owing to
dimerization. On the other hand, [Au(tmdt)2] locates in the subtle region in
terms of the degree of orbital mixing. We propose possible scenarios for its
puzzling antiferromagnetic phase transition, involving the M\sigma orbital in
contrast to previous discussions mostly concentrating on the L sector.

cooperative action of thousands of nanometer-sized molecular motors to carry
out mechanical tasks at much larger length scales, such as cell motility,
division and replication. Besides their biological importance, such inherently
non-equilibrium processes are an inspiration for developing biomimetic active
materials from microscopic components that consume energy to generate
continuous motion. Being actively driven, these materials are not constrained
by the laws of equilibrium statistical mechanics and can thus exhibit highly
sought-after properties such as autonomous motility, internally generated flows
and self-organized beating. Starting from extensile microtubule bundles, we
hierarchically assemble active analogs of conventional polymer gels, liquid
crystals and emulsions. At high enough concentration, microtubules form a
percolating active network characterized by internally driven chaotic flows,
hydrodynamic instabilities, enhanced transport and fluid mixing. When confined
to emulsion droplets, 3D networks spontaneously adsorb onto the droplet
surfaces to produce highly active 2D nematic liquid crystals whose streaming
flows are controlled by internally generated fractures and self-healing, as
well as unbinding and annihilation of oppositely charged disclination defects.
The resulting active emulsions exhibit unexpected properties, such as
autonomous motility, which are not observed in their passive analogues. Taken
together, these observations exemplify how assemblages of animate microscopic
objects exhibit collective biomimetic properties that are starkly different
from those found in materials assembled from inanimate building blocks,
challenging us to develop a theoretical framework that would allow for a
systematic engineering of their far-from-equilibrium material properties.

behavior in a gaugino mediation model, and show that the fine-tuning is indeed
reduced to about 2 percent level if the ratio of the gluino mass to wino mass
is about 0.4 at the GUT scale. We show that such a mass ratio may arise
naturally in a product group unification model without the doublet-triplet
splitting problem. This fact suggests that the fine-tuning problem crucially
depends on the physics at the high energy scale.

many-body correlations beyond the Hartree-Fock (HF) mean-field approximation on
the dynamics. In order to predict the dynamics, we utilize the numerical exact
diagonalization method and also reproduce the calculation in the HF
approximation for comparison. The toroidal gases originally have a rotational
symmetry in the toroidal direction. We firstly prepare a deformed ground state
as an initial state by adding a weak potential deformed in the toroidal
direction, and then remove the potential to start the dynamics. In the
dynamics, number densities of the deformed gases exhibit oscillations as
demonstrated in the present paper. As a result, we find out that the bosons and
fermions show quite different behaviors owing to quantum statistics. In
particular, the bosons exhibit a low-frequency oscillation in the strong
boson-boson attraction regime owing to the many-body correlations, and it can
not be reproduced in the HF approximation. The oscillation of the fermions is
strongly influenced by that of the bosons through the boson-fermion interaction
as a forced oscillator. In addition, we also discuss a relationship between the
low-frequency oscillation and restoration of the broken symmetry.

effect is revisited and validated against state-of-the-art reanalyses.
Untraditional diagnostics show a physically consistent picture, for which the
state of earth's climate is constrained by well-known physical principles, such
as energy balance, flow and, conservation. Greenhouse gas concentrations affect
the atmospheric optical depth for infrared radiation, and increased opacity
implies higher altitude from which earth's equivalent bulk heat loss takes
place without being re-absorbed. Such increase is seen in the reanalyses. There
has also been a reduction in the correlation between the spatial structure of
outgoing long-wave radiation and surface temperature, consistent with
increasingly more processes interfering with the upwelling infrared light
before it reaches the top of the atmosphere. State-of-the-art reanalyses
further imply increases in the overturning in the troposphere, consistent with
a constant and continuous vertical energy flow. The associateion between these
aspects can be interpreted as an entanglement between greenhouse effect and the
hydrological cycle, where reduced energy transfer associated with increased
opacity is compensated by tropospheric overturning activity.

the variability observed in microquasars, especially concerning the elusive
High-Frequency Quasi-Periodic Oscillation. These oscillations are among the
fastest phenomena that affect matter in the vicinity of stellar black holes and
therefore could be used as probes of strong-field general relativity.
Nevertheless, no model has yet gained wide acceptance. Aims. The aim of this
article is to investigate the model derived from the occurrence of the Rossby
wave instability at the inner edge of the accretion disk. In particular, our
goal here is to demonstrate the capacity of this instability to modulate the
observed flux in agreement with the observed results. Methods. We use the
AMRVAC hydrodynamical code to model the instability in a 3D optically thin
disk. The GYOTO ray-tracing code is then used to compute the associated light
curve. Results. We show that the 3D Rossby wave instability is able to modulate
the flux well within the observed limits.We highlight that 2D simulations allow
us to obtain the same general characteristics of the light curve as 3D
calculations. With the time resolution we adopted in this work, three
dimensional simulations do not give rise to any new observable features that
could be detected by current instrumentation or archive data.

fragmentation will be affected. The strength of self-gravitating disc stresses
is expected to dictate disc fragmentation: as the strength of these torques
typically decrease with increasing sound speed, it is reasonable to assume, to
first-order, that disc fragmentation is suppressed when compared to the
non-irradiated case, although previous work has shown that the details are
complicated by the source of the irradiation. We expand on previous analysis of
the Jeans mass inside spiral structures in self-gravitating discs,
incorporating the effects of stellar irradiation and background irradiation. If
irradiation is present, fragmentation is suppressed for marginally unstable
discs at low accretion rates (compared to the no-irradiation case), but these
lower accretion rates correspond to higher mass discs. Fragmentation can still
occur for high accretion rates, but is consequently suppressed at lower disc
surface densities, and the subsequent Jeans mass is boosted. These results
further bolster the consensus that, without subsequent fragment disruption or
mass loss, the gravitational instability is more likely to form brown dwarfs
and low-mass stars than gas giant planets.

catastrophes, which are abrupt stochastic transitions from a growing to a

Microtubules can exert pushing or polymerization forces on an obstacle, such as
an elastic barrier if the growing end is in contact with the obstacle. We use
dynamical mean-field theory and stochastic simulations to analyze a model where
each microtubule undergoes catastrophes and rescues and where microtubules
interact by force sharing. For zero rescue rate, cooperative growth terminates
in a collective catastrophe. The maximal polymerization force before
catastrophes grows linearly with N for small N or a stiff elastic barrier, in
agreement with available experimental results, whereas it crosses over to a
logarithmic dependence for larger N or a soft elastic barrier. For a nonzero
rescue rate and a soft elastic barrier, the dynamics becomes oscillatory with
both collective catastrophe and rescue events, which are part of a robust limit
cycle. Both the average and maximal polymerization forces then grow linearly
with N, and we investigate their dependence on tubulin on-rates and rescue
rates, which can be involved in cellular regulation mechanisms. We further
investigate the robustness of the collective catastrophe and rescue
oscillations with respect to different catastrophe models.

piezo-actuator based transport of atom ensembles over distances of more than
one trap separation, examine the capabilities of rapid atom transport provided
by acousto-optical beam steering, and analyze the adiabaticity limit for atom
transport in these configurations. We implement a spatial light modulator with
8-bit transmission control for the per-site adjustment of the trap depth and
the number of atoms loaded. We combine single-site addressing, trap depth
control, and atom transport in one configuration for demonstrating the
splitting of atom ensembles with variable ratio at predefined register sites.
Finally, we use controlled sub-poissonian preparation of single trapped atoms
from such an ensemble to show that our approach allows for the implementation
of a continuous supply of single-atom qubits with high fidelity. These novel
implementations and their combined operation significantly extend available
techniques for the dynamical and reconfigurable manipulation of ultracold atoms

state with respect to any cut in the chain is upper bounded by $O{\frac{\log^3

Chebyshev-based AGSP (Approximate Ground Space Projection) with favorable
factors. However, our construction uses the Hamiltonian directly, instead of
using the Detectability lemma, which allows us to work with general
(frustrated) Hamiltonians, as well as slightly improving the $1/\eps$

""random-walk like"", bound on the entanglement rank of an arbitrary power of a
1D Hamiltonian, which might be of independent interest: \ER{H^\ell} \le (\ell
d)^{O(\sqrt{\ell})}. Finally, treating d as a constant, our AGSP shows that the
ground state is well approximated by a matrix product state with a sublinear
bond dimension $B=e^{O(\log^{3/4}n/\eps^{1/4})}. Using this in conjunction with
known dynamical programing algorithms, yields an algorithm for a 1/\poly(n)

temperature and column density maps of G48 using a model based on a modified
blackbody. We find that G48 has a relatively simple structure and is relatively
isolated; thus this IRDC provides an excellent target to study the collapse and
fragmentation of a filamentary structure in the absence of complicating factors
such as strong external feedback. The derived temperature structure of G48 is
clearly non-isothermal from cloud to core scale. The column density peaks are
spatially coincident with the lowest temperatures (~ 17.5 K) in G48. A total
cloud mass of ~390Msun is derived from the column density maps. By comparing
the luminosity-to-mass ratio of 13 point sources detected in the Herschel/PACS
bands to evolutionary models, we find that two cores are likely to evolve into
high-mass stars (M>8 Msun). The derived mean projected separation of point
sources is smaller than in other IRDCs but in good agreement with theoretical
predications for cylindrical collapse. We detect several molecular species such
as CO, HCO+, HCN, HNC and N2H+. CO is depleted by a factor of ~3.5 compared to
the expected interstellar abundance, from which we conclude that CO freezes out
in the central region. Furthermore, the molecular clumps, associated with the
sub-millimeter peaks in G48, appear to be gravitationally unbound or just
pressure confined. The analysis of critical line masses in G48 show that the
entire filament is collapsing, overcoming any internal support.

structural disorder in the films were found to be strongly dependent on their
growth temperature. The films grown at 150, 300 and 350 C were found to be
semiconductor-like in the whole measurement temperature range of resistivity
due to the enhanced disorder in these films. However, a metal to semiconductor
transition (MST) at low temperature has been observed in the films grown at 200

residual resistivity, the transition temperature shifted towards the higher
value due to the increased disorder in this film as compared to that grown at

explained by considering quantum corrections to the Boltzmanns conductivity
which includes the effect of weak localization and coulomb electron-electron
interactions related to the existence of disorder in these films.

the bulk band inversion taking place at x_c. The tunability of the location of

both slow and fast moving particles in the system. In this study we
\emph{directly} calculate the distribution of the diffusivity for a model

decreasing temperature, the distribution evolves from Gaussian to bimodal

mobile particles which show strong violation of the Stokes-Einstein relation in
agreement with the previous studies on different model glass forming systems.
Motivated by some of the recent studies where an ideal glass transition is
proposed by randomly pinning some fraction of particles, we then studied the SE
breakdown as a function of random pinning concentration in our model system. We
showed that degree of SE breakdown increases quite dramatically with increasing
pinning concentration, thereby providing a new way to unravel the puzzles of SE

perpendicular to the grain boundary) for efficient coupling of its stray
magnetic field to the SQUID loop. The separation of the location of optimum
coupling from the junctions allows for an independent optimization of the
coupling factor $\phi_\mu$ and junction properties. We present different
methods for calculating $\phi_\mu$ (for a magnetic nanoparticle placed 10\,nm
above the constriction) as a function of device geometry and show that those
yield consistent results. Furthermore, by numerical simulations we obtain a
general expression for the dependence of the SQUID inductance on geometrical

modified by irradiation with swift (E_{kin}=92 MeV) heavy ions under glancing
angles of incidence. Upon ion impact individual surface tracks are created in
graphene on SiC. Due to the very localized energy deposition characteristic for
ions in this energy range, the surface area which is structurally altered is
limited to ~ 0.01 mum^2 per track. Kelvin probe force microscopy reveals that
those surface tracks consist of electronically modified material and that a few
tracks suffice to shift the surface potential of the whole single layer flake
by ~ 400 meV. Thus, the irradiation turns the initially n-doped graphene into
p-doped graphene with a hole density of 8.5 x 10^{12} holes/cm^2. This doping
effect persists even after heating the irradiated samples to 500{\deg}C.
Therefore, this charge transfer is not due to adsorbates but must instead be
attributed to implanted atoms. The method presented here opens up a new way to
efficiently manipulate the charge carrier concentration of graphene.

parallel layers using a four-fermion effective field theory at zero density.
This system reveals a number of interesting features. While for infinitely
large separation (no boundaries), chiral symmetry is broken or restored via a
second order phase transition, in the opposite case of small (and, in general,
finite) separation the transition becomes first order, rendering effects of
finite size, for the present setup, similar to those of a chemical potential.
Appropriately moving on the separation-temperature plane, it is possible to
generate a peculiar behavior in the temperature dependence of the thermodynamic
potential and of the condensate, compensating thermal with geometrical
variations. A behavior similar to what we find here has been predicted to occur
in bilayer graphene. Chiral symmetry breaking induces different phases

Statistical decision theory provides a basis for this approach by requiring

useful models are obviously false (that is, not exactly true) even before

gauge the consistency (or inconsistency) of the observed data with the assumed

be true (or false), or whether some alternative is likely to be true (or
false). In this practical formulation, a significance test rejects a
hypothesis/model only if the observed data is highly improbable when
calculating the probability while assuming the hypothesis being tested; the

experimental and simulated data as stressed lately by the Higgs search at LHC
and the recent identification of a Higgs-like new boson. The first link in the
full simulation chain is the event generation both for background and for
expected signals. Nowadays event generators are based on the automatic
computation of matrix element or amplitude for each process of interest.
  Moreover, recent analysis techniques based on the matrix element likelihood
method assign probabilities for every event to belong to any of a given set of
possible processes. This method originally used for the top mass measurement,
although computing intensive, has shown its power at LHC to extract the new
boson signal from the background.
  Serving both needs, the automatic calculation of matrix element is therefore
more than ever of prime importance for particle physics. Initiated in the
eighties, the techniques have matured for the lowest order calculations
(tree-level), but become complex and CPU time consuming when higher order
calculations involving loop diagrams are necessary like for QCD processes at
LHC. New calculation techniques for next-to-leading order (NLO) have surfaced
making possible the generation of processes with many final state particles (up
to 6). If NLO calculations are in many cases under control, although not yet
fully automatic, even higher precision calculations involving processes at
2-loops or more remain a big challenge.
  After a short introduction to particle physics and to the related theoretical
framework, we will review some of the computing techniques that have been
developed to make these calculations automatic. The main available packages and
some of the most important applications for simulation and data analysis, in
particular at LHC will also be summarized.

explore two models for the secondary property, namely subhalo assembly time and
local dark matter density around each subhalo. The model predictions for the
galaxy two-point correlation functions are compared with the recent results
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We show that the observed color dependence
of galaxy clustering can be reproduced well by our method applied to
cosmological N-body simulations without baryonic processes. We then compare the
model predictions for the color-dependent galaxy-mass cross correlation
functions with the results from gravitational lensing observations. The
comparison allows us to distinguish the models, and also to discuss what
subhalo property should be used to assign color to subhalos accurately. We show
that the extended abundance matching method using the local dark matter density
as a color proxy provides an accurate description of the galaxy populations in
the local universe. We also study impacts of scatter in the local dark matter
density-color relations. Introducing scatter improves agreements of our model
predictions with the observed red and blue galaxy clustering and is needed to
explain observed correlation functions in finer color bins. Finally, we study
red galaxy fraction profiles in galaxy group- and cluster-sized halos and find
the red fraction profiles have a relatively strong dependence on our model
parameters. We argue that the red fraction profiles can be an important
observational clue, in addition to galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing,

  Conference on Data Mining, 2014",,,,"cs.LG cs.DB cs.DS stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Frequent Itemsets (FIs) mining is a fundamental primitive in data mining. It
requires to identify all itemsets appearing in at least a fraction $\theta$ of
a transactional dataset $\mathcal{D}$. Often though, the ultimate goal of
mining $\mathcal{D}$ is not an analysis of the dataset \emph{per se}, but the
understanding of the underlying process that generated it. Specifically, in
many applications $\mathcal{D}$ is a collection of samples obtained from an
unknown probability distribution $\pi$ on transactions, and by extracting the
FIs in $\mathcal{D}$ one attempts to infer itemsets that are frequently (i.e.,
with probability at least $\theta$) generated by $\pi$, which we call the True
Frequent Itemsets (TFIs). Due to the inherently stochastic nature of the
generative process, the set of FIs is only a rough approximation of the set of
TFIs, as it often contains a huge number of \emph{false positives}, i.e.,
spurious itemsets that are not among the TFIs. In this work we design and
analyze an algorithm to identify a threshold $\hat{\theta}$ such that the
collection of itemsets with frequency at least $\hat{\theta}$ in $\mathcal{D}$
contains only TFIs with probability at least $1-\delta$, for some
user-specified $\delta$. Our method uses results from statistical learning
theory involving the (empirical) VC-dimension of the problem at hand. This
allows us to identify almost all the TFIs without including any false positive.
We also experimentally compare our method with the direct mining of
$\mathcal{D}$ at frequency $\theta$ and with techniques based on widely-used
standard bounds (i.e., the Chernoff bounds) of the binomial distribution, and
show that our algorithm outperforms these methods and achieves even better
results than what is guaranteed by the theoretical analysis.

characterization of early sources of hydrogen-ionizing photons. The 2012 Hubble
Ultra Deep Field (UDF12) campaign has acquired the deepest infrared images with
the Wide Field Camera 3 aboard Hubble Space Telescope and, for the first time,
systematically explored the galaxy population deep into the era when cosmic
microwave background (CMB) data indicates reionization was underway. The UDF12
campaign thus provides the best constraints to date on the abundance,
luminosity distribution, and spectral properties of early star-forming
galaxies. We synthesize the new UDF12 results with the most recent constraints
from CMB observations to infer redshift-dependent ultraviolet (UV) luminosity
densities, reionization histories, and electron scattering optical depth
evolution consistent with the available data. Under reasonable assumptions
about the escape fraction of hydrogen ionizing photons and the intergalactic
medium clumping factor, we find that to fully reionize the universe by redshift
z~6 the population of star-forming galaxies at redshifts z~7-9 likely must
extend in luminosity below the UDF12 limits to absolute UV magnitudes of
M_UV\sim -13 or fainter. Moreover, low levels of star formation extending to
redshifts z~15-25, as suggested by the normal UV colors of z\simeq7-8 galaxies
and the smooth decline in abundance with redshift observed by UDF12 to
z\simeq10, are additionally likely required to reproduce the optical depth to
electron scattering inferred from CMB observations.

band of a stationary optical lattice can be transformed and controlled by a
second, weaker, periodic potential moving at a constant speed along the axis of
the stationary lattice. The atom trajectories exhibit complex behavior, which
depends sensitively on the amplitude and speed of the propagating lattice. When
the speed and amplitude of the moving potential are low, the atoms are dragged
through the static lattice and perform drifting orbits with frequencies an
order of magnitude higher than that corresponding to the moving potential.
Increasing either the speed or amplitude of the moving lattice induces
Bloch-like oscillations within the energy band of the static lattice, which
exhibit complex resonances at critical values of the system parameters. In some
cases, a very small change in these parameters can reverse the atom's direction
of motion. In order to understand these dynamics we present an analytical
model, which describes the key features of the atom transport and also
accurately predicts the positions of the resonant features in the atom's phase
space. The abrupt controllable transitions between dynamical regimes, and the
associated set of resonances, provide a mechanism for transporting atoms
between precise locations in a lattice: as required for using cold atoms to
simulate condensed matter or as a stepping stone to quantum information
processing. The system also provides a direct quantum simulator of acoustic

Molecules that fulfill a twist neutrality condition, a zero sum rule for the

neutrally to strain. This has implications for plasmids. For small circular
microDNAs it follows that there must exist a minimum length for these to be

  Global solution of the Prony system, i.e. inversion of the Prony mapping,
encounters several types of singularities. One of the most important ones is a
collision of some of the points $x_{i}.$ The investigation of this type of
singularities has been started in \cite{yom2009Singularities} where the role of
finite differences was demonstrated.
  In the present paper we study this and other types of singularities of the
Prony mapping, and describe its global geometry. We show, in particular, close
connections of the Prony mapping with the ""Vieta mapping"" expressing the
coefficients of a polynomial through its roots, and with hyperbolic polynomials
and ""Vandermonde mapping"" studied by V. Arnold.

based on the classical nucleation theory but considers also vapor depletion
around the formed embryo. As the result the free energy has to be recalculated
which brings a new expression for the nucleation rate.

  Series (No. 2008-97) Tilburg University",,,,"q-fin.GN q-fin.TR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Interval bankruptcy problems arise in situations where an estate has to be
liquidated among a fixed number of creditors and uncertainty about the amounts
of the claims is modeled by intervals. We extend in the interval setting the
classical results by Curiel, Maschler and Tijs (1987) that characterize
division rules which correspond to solutions of the cooperative bankruptcy
game. Finally, we analyze the difficulties with incorporating the uncertainty
about the estate.

i.e.,arithmetic on the Weyl algebras with ergodic theory to transport
operators. We prove that finite Hasse-Dirichlet alternating zeta functions or
eta functions can be induced from a product of ""creation operators"". The latter
idea is the result of considering complex quantum mechanics with complex
time-space related concepts. Then we overview these ideas, with variations,
which may provide a pathway that may settle RH; e.g., a Euler Factor analysis
to study the quantum behavior of the integers as one pushes up the critical
line near a macro zeta function zero.

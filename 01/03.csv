densities and temperatures. They can be used to obtain information on the
dynamics and physical conditions of the observed regions. In order to obtain
reliable constraints on the physical conditions prevailing in the masing
regions, it is necessary to model the excitation mechanisms of the energy
levels of the observed molecules. We present a numerical method that enables us
to obtain self-consistent solutions for both the statistical equilibrium and
radiative transfer equations. Using the standard maser theory, the method of
Short Characteristics is extended to obtain the solution of the
integro-differential radiative transfer equation, appropriate to the case of
intense masing lines. We have applied our method to the maser lines of the H2O
molecule and we compare with the results obtained with a less accurate
approach. In the regime of large maser opacities we find large differences in
the intensity of the maser lines that could be as high as several orders of
magnitude. The comparison between the two methods shows, however, that the
effect on the thermal lines is modest. Finally, the effect introduced by rate
coefficients on the prediction of H2O masing lines and opacities is discussed,
making use of various sets of rate coefficients involving He, o-H2 and p-H2. We
find that the masing nature of a line is not affected by the selected
collisional rates. However, from one set to the other the modelled line
opacities and intensities can vary by up to a factor ~2 and ~10 respectively.

motivated by a new geometric perspective by Bray [arXiv:1212.5745]. Wave dark
matter describes dark matter as a scalar field which satisfies the
Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations. These equations rely on a fundamental constant
Upsilon (also known as the ""mass term"" of the Klein-Gordon equation). In this
work, we compare the wave dark matter model to observations to obtain a working
value of Upsilon.
  Specifically, we compare the mass profiles of spherically symmetric static
states of wave dark matter to the Burkert mass profiles that have been shown by
Salucci et al. [arXiv:1111.1165] to predict well the velocity dispersion
profiles of the eight classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies. We show that a
reasonable working value for the fundamental constant in the wave dark matter
model is Upsilon = 50 yr^{-1}. We also show that under precise assumptions the
value of Upsilon can be bounded above by 1000 yr^{-1}.

superposition of many independent events. If the rate of events per unit time
is sufficiently high, the resulting background is Gaussian, which is to say
that it is characterized only by a gravitational-wave strain power spectrum.
Alternatively, if the event rate is low, we expect a non-Gaussian background,
characterized by intermittent sub-threshold bursts. Many experimentally
accessible models of the SGWB, such as the SGWB arising from compact binary
coalescences, are expected to be of this non-Gaussian variety. Primordial
backgrounds from the early universe, on the other hand, are more likely to be
Gaussian. Measuring the Gaussianity of the SGWB can therefore provide
additional information about its origin. In this paper we introduce a novel
maximum likelihood estimator that can be used to estimate the non-Gaussian
component of an SGWB signature measured in a network of interferometers. This
method can be robustly applied to spatially separated interferometers with
colored, non-Gaussian noise. Furthermore, it can be cast as a generalization of

  Classifier performance is usually expressed as fractions of the confusion
matrix, such as sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive
values. We extend this concept to soft classification and discuss the bias and
variance properties of the extended performance measures. Ambiguity in
reference labels translates to differences between best-case, expected and
worst-case performance. We show a second set of measures comparing expected and
ideal performance which is closely related to regression performance, namely
the root mean squared error RMSE and the mean absolute error MAE.
  All calculations apply to classical crisp classification as well as to soft
classification (partial class memberships and/or one-class classifiers). The
proposed performance measures allow to test classifiers with actual borderline
cases. In addition, hardening of e.g. posterior probabilities into class labels
is not necessary, avoiding the corresponding information loss and increase in
variance.

trapped ions, neutral atoms, atomic ensembles, and nitrogen-vacancy spins. The
entangling interaction couples an initial quantum memory state to two possible

  It is found that the K-band continuum squared visibilities are compatible
with a circumbinary disc with a radius of ~0.5 AU. However, a significant
fraction (~50 per cent) of the flux is unresolved and not fully accounted by
the stellar photospheres. The stars probably don't hold circumstellar discs, in
addition to the circumbinary disk, due to the combined effects of inner
magnetospheric truncation and outer tidal truncation. This unresolved flux
likely arises in compact structures inside the tidally disrupted circumbinary
disc.
  Most ($\gtrsim 90$ per cent) of the Br gamma line emission is unresolved. The
line-to-continuum spectro-astrometry shifts in time, along the direction of the
Ly alpha jet known to be driven by the system. The shift is anti-correlated
with the Br gamma equivalent width. It is shown that the unresolved Br gamma
emission cannot originate in the jet but instead is compatible with stellar
emission from the orbiting binary components. The increase in the absolute
value of the equivalent width of the line takes place at periastron passage; it
could arise in an accretion burst, a flare or in the increase in effective size
of the emission region by the interaction of the magnetospheres. The binary
longitude of the ascending node is found to be $\Omega=(235\pm3)\degr$ and the
orbit retrograde.
  The origin of the jet is revisited. The tidal disruption of the circumstellar

gamma. A precision measurement of this quantity is highly desirable as it forms

Hence a measurement of gamma in tree level processes leads to a standard model

in future observation missions. The aims of this study is to formally derive,
from scaling arguments, a manageable reduced set of equations for analysis,
i.e. a magnetic formulation of the equations of quasigeostrophy appropriate for
a multi-layer atmosphere. The main goal is to provide a simpler theoretical
platform to explore the dynamics possible within confined magnetized layers of
exoplanet atmospheres. We primarily use scaling arguments to derive the reduced
equations of ""magnetoquasigeostrophy"" which assumes dynamics to take place in
an atmospheric layer which is vertically thin compared to its horizontal
scales. The derived equation set retains features existing in standard
shallow-water magnetohydrodynamic equations but are absent in more classical
derivations of the quasi-geostrophic limit, namely, the non-divergence of the
in-plane components of the magnetic field. We liken this non-divergence of the
in-plane magnetic fields as indicative of a quantity whose behaviour mimics a
two-dimensional ""pseudo""-magnetic monopole source. We also find, using the same
scaling argument procedures, appropriate limits of the fundamental parameters
of the system which yield reduced equations describing the flow dynamics
primarily characterized by magnetostrophic balance. The standard scaling
arguments employed here show how traditional magnetized quasigeostrophic
equations connect to their magnetized shallow water forms. The equations

the variation of the phase angle of complex eigenvalue $\alpha_{1}$ of pump

(GRBs) predicts a sharp cooling break $\nu_c$ in its afterglow spectrum, the
GRB observations so far rarely show clear evidence for a cooling break in their
spectra or its corresponding temporal break in their light curves. Employing a
Lagrangian description of the blast wave, we conduct a sophisticated
calculation of the afterglow emission. We precisely follow the cooling history
of non-thermal electrons accelerated into each Lagrangian shell. We show that a
detailed calculation of afterglow spectra does not in fact give rise to a sharp
cooling break at $\nu_c$. Instead, it displays a very mild and smooth
transition, which occurs gradually over a few orders of magnitude in energy or
frequency. The main source of this slow transition is that different
mini-shells have different evolution histories of the comoving magnetic field
strength $B$, so that deriving the current value of $\nu_c$ of each mini-shell
requires an integration of its cooling rate over the time elapsed since its
creation. We present the time evolution of optical and X-ray spectral indices
to demonstrate the slow transition of spectral regimes, and discuss the
implications of our result in interpreting GRB afterglow data.

model correlation between continuous-valued sources more realistically and

and decoding procedures are described in detail for discrete Fourier transform
(DFT) codes, both for syndrome- and parity-based approaches. We also extend the
parity-based approach to the case where the transmission channel is noisy and
perform distributed joint source-channel coding in this context. The proposed
system is well suited for low-delay communications. Furthermore, the

sigma-models with extended supersymmetry is performed within the context of
generalised complex geometry. More specifically the supersymmetric
Wess-Zumino-Witten model on a variety of group manifolds was considered. By
explicitly calculating the admissible complex structures and the associated
pure spinors on the target manifold a full characterisation of the different
possible geometries is provided. By using this approach the various aspects of
generalised K\""ahler geometry can be studied in detail. Also considered are the
various isometries present in the model and duality relations linking the
different descriptions.

complex networks has in recent years become an important topic of study due to
its many applications: the adoption of commercial products, spread of disease,
the diffusion of an idea, etc. In this paper, we begin by identifying a
desiderata of seven properties that a framework for modeling such processes
should satisfy: the ability to represent attributes of both nodes and edges, an
explicit representation of time, the ability to represent non-Markovian
temporal relationships, representation of uncertain information, the ability to
represent competing cascades, allowance of non-monotonic diffusion, and
computational tractability. We then present the MANCaLog language, a formalism
based on logic programming that satisfies all these desiderata, and focus on
algorithms for finding minimal models (from which the outcome of cascades can
be obtained) as well as how this formalism can be applied in real world
scenarios. We are not aware of any other formalism in the literature that meets
all of the above requirements.

the effects of both Ohmic resistivity and ambipolar diffusion (AD). The
magnetic diffusion coefficients are evaluated self-consistently from a look-up
table based on equilibrium chemistry. We first show that the inclusion of AD
dramatically changes the conventional picture of layered accretion. Without net
vertical magnetic field, the system evolves into a toroidal field dominated
configuration with extremely weak turbulence in the far-UV ionization layer
that is far too inefficient to drive rapid accretion. In the presence of a weak
net vertical field (plasma beta~10^5 at midplane), we find that the MRI is
completely suppressed, resulting in a fully laminar flow throughout the
vertical extent of the disk. A strong magnetocentrifugal wind is launched that
efficiently carries away disk angular momentum and easily accounts for the
observed accretion rate in PPDs. Moreover, under a physical disk wind geometry,
all the accretion flow proceeds through a strong current layer with thickness
of ~0.3H that is offset from disk midplane with radial velocity of up to 0.4
times the sound speed. Both Ohmic resistivity and AD are essential for the
suppression of the MRI and wind launching. The efficiency of wind transport
increases with increasing net vertical magnetic flux and the penetration depth
of the FUV ionization. Our laminar wind solution has important implications on
planet formation and global evolution of PPDs.

window into the history of star formation (SF) at early times. Two widely used
`chronometers' include the alpha and iron-peak elements, which are created on
short and long timescales, respectively. These two clocks have been widely used
to estimate SF timescales from moderate-resolution spectra of early-type
galaxies. Elements formed via s-process neutron captures (e.g., Sr and Ba)
comprise a third type of chronometer, as the site of the main s-process is
believed to be intermediate and low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars. The
[alpha/Ba] ratio in particular should provide a powerful new constraint on the
SF histories of galaxies, in part because it is insensitive to the uncertain
distribution of type Ia SNe detonation times and the overall Ia rate. Here we
present new measurements of the abundance of Sr and Ba in nearby early-type
galaxies by applying stellar population synthesis tools to high S/N optical
spectra. We find a strong anti-correlation between [Mg/Fe] and [Ba/Fe], and a
strong positive correlation between [Mg/Ba] and galaxy velocity dispersion.
These trends are consistent with the idea that more massive galaxies formed
their stars on shorter timescales compared to less massive galaxies, and rule
out several other proposed explanations for the observed super-solar [Mg/Fe]
values in massive galaxies. In contrast, [Sr/Fe]~0, with no strong variation
across the sample. It is difficult to interpret the Sr trends without detailed
chemical evolution models owing to the multiplicity of proposed nucleosynthetic
sites for Sr.

method for solving for Large Scale Structure (LSS) in a frame that is comoving
with observers following trajectories calculated in Lagrangian Perturbation
Theory (LPT). Unlike standard N-body methods, the COLA method can
straightforwardly trade accuracy at small-scales in order to gain computational
speed without sacrificing accuracy at large scales. This is especially useful
for cheaply generating large ensembles of accurate mock halo catalogs required
to study galaxy clustering and weak lensing, as those catalogs are essential
for performing detailed error analysis for ongoing and future surveys of LSS.
As an illustration, we ran a COLA-based N-body code on a box of size 100Mpc/h
with particles of mass ~5*10^9Msolar/h. Running the code with only 10 timesteps
was sufficient to obtain an accurate description of halo statistics down to
halo masses of at least 10^11Msolar/h. This is only at a modest speed penalty
when compared to mocks obtained with LPT. A standard detailed N-body run is
orders of magnitude slower than our COLA-based code. The speed-up we obtain
with COLA is due to the fact that we calculate the large-scale dynamics exactly
using LPT, while letting the N-body code solve for the small scales, without
requiring it to capture exactly the internal dynamics of halos. Achieving a
similar level of accuracy in halo statistics without the COLA method requires
at least 3 times more timesteps than when COLA is employed.

following the behaviour of the solar elevation angle. We measure the interline
background at 1.520 microns where the instrumental thermal background is very
low and study its variation with zenith distance, time after sunset, ecliptic
latitude, lunar zenith angle and lunar distance to determine the presence of
non-thermal atmospheric emission, zodiacal scattered light and scattered
moonlight. Zodiacal scattered light is too faint to be detected in the summed
observations. Scattered moonlight due to Mie scattering by atmospheric aerosols
is seen at small lunar distances (< 11 deg), but is otherwise too faint to
detect. Except at very small lunar distances the interline background at a
resolving power of R~2400 when using OH suppression fibres is dominated by a
non-thermal atmospheric source with a temporal behaviour that resembles
atmospheric OH emission suggesting that the interline background contains
instrumentally-scattered OH. However, the interline background dims more
rapidly than OH early in the night suggesting contributions from rapid dimming
molecules. The absolute interline background is 560 +/- 120 photons s^-1 m^-2
micron^-1 arcsec^-2 under dark conditions. This value is similar to previous
measurements without OH suppression suggesting that non-suppressed atmospheric
emission is responsible for the interline background. Future OH suppression
fibre designs may address this by the suppression of more sky lines using more
accurate sky line measurements taken from high resolution spectra.

alternative conditions so that enough data points fall on the facets of a cone

  welcome",,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present an observational evidence for the vorticity effect on the
nonlinear evolution of the galaxy angular momentum. We first calculate the
vorticity as the curl of the peculiar velocity field reconstructed from the
2MASS redshift survey. Then, measuring the alignments between the vorticity and
the tidal shear fields, we study how the alignment strength and tendency
depends on the cosmic web environment. It is found that in the knot and
filament regions the vorticity vectors are anti-aligned with the directions of
the maximal volume compression while in the void and sheet regions they are
anti-aligned with the directions of the minimal compression. Determining the
spin axes of the nearby large face-on and edge-on disk galaxies from the
Seventh Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and measuring their
correlations with the vorticity vectors at the galaxy positions, we finally
detect a clear signal of the alignments between the galaxy spin and the local
vorticity fields. The null hypothesis that there is no alignment between them
is rejected at the 99.999% confidence level. Our result supports
observationally the recently proposed scenario that although the galaxy angular
momentum originates from the initial tidal interaction in the linear regime its
subsequent evolution is driven primarily by the cosmic vorticity field.

of ancillary qubits and the depth of computation, to obtain robust computation.
However, most of known techniques, based on local rewriting rules, for
parallelising quantum circuits will require the addition of ancilla qubits,
leading to an undesired space-time tradeoff. Recently several novel approaches
based on measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) techniques attempted to
resolve this problem. The key element is to explore the global structure of a
given circuit, defined via translation into a corresponding MBQC pattern. It is
known that the parallel power of MBQC is superior to the quantum circuit model,
and hence in these approaches one could apply the MBQC depth optimisation
techniques to achieve a lower depth. However, currently, once the obtained
parallel pattern is translated back to a quantum circuit, one should either
increase the depth or add ancilla qubits. In this paper we characterise those
computations where both optimisation could be achieved together. In doing so we
present a new connection between two MBQC depth optimisation procedures, known
as the maximally delayed generalised flow and signal shifting. This structural
link will allow us to apply an MBQC qubit optimisation procedure known as
compactification to a large class of pattern including all those obtained from
any arbitrary quantum circuit. We also present a more efficient algorithm
(compared to the existing one) for finding the maximally delayed generalised
flow for graph states with flow.

does not strongly affect the magnification cross section in gravitational
lensing while the halo radial profiles do. Since the baryonic cooling effect is
stronger in galaxies than clusters, galactic haloes are more concentrated. In
light of this, a new scenario of two halo population model is explored where
galaxies are modeled as a singular isothermal sphere profile and clusters as a
Navarro, Frenk and White (NFW) profile. We find the transition mass between the
two has modest effects on the lensing probability. The cosmological parameter

crustal thickness of 34.4+-4.1 km in the continents and 8.0+-2.7 km in the
oceans. In situ seismic velocity provided by CRUST 2.0 allows us to estimate
the average composition of the deep continental crust by using new and updated
compositional databases for amphibolite and granulite facies rocks in
combination with laboratory ultrasonic velocities measurements. An updated
xenolithic peridotite database is used to represent the average composition of
continental lithospheric mantle. Monte Carlo simulation is used to predict the
geoneutrino flux at 16 selected locations and to track the asymmetrical
uncertainties of radiogenic heat power due to the log-normal distributions of
HPE concentrations in crustal rocks.

galaxies via molecular and atomic fine structure line emission has gone from a
curious look into a few extreme, rare objects, to a mainstream tool to study
galaxy formation, out to the highest redshifts. Molecular gas has now been
observed in close to 200 galaxies at z>1, including numerous AGN host-galaxies
out to z~7, highly starforming sub-millimeter galaxies (median redshift z~2.5),
and increasing samples of 'main-sequence' star forming galaxies at z~1.5-2.5.
Studies have moved well beyond simple detections, to dynamical imaging at
kpc-scale resolution, and multi-line, multi-species studies that determine the
physical conditions in the interstellar medium. Observations of the cool gas
are the required complement to studies of the stellar density and star
formation history of the Universe, as they reveal the phase of the interstellar
medium that immediately precedes star formation. Current observations suggest
that the order of magnitude increase in the cosmic star formation rate density
from z~0 to 2 is commensurate with a similar increase in the gas to stellar
mass ratio in star forming disk galaxies. Progress has been made on determining
the CO luminosity to H_2 mass conversion factor at high-z, and the dichotomy
between high versus low depletion time values for main sequence versus
starburst galaxies, respectively, with a likely dependence on metallicity and
other local physical conditions. Studies of atomic fine structure line emission
are rapidly progressing, with some tens of galaxies detected in the
exceptionally bright [CII] 158 micron line to date. This line is proving to be
a unique tracer of galaxy dynamics in the early Universe and has the potential
to be the most direct means of obtaining spectroscopic redshifts for the first
galaxies during cosmic reionization.

the cation Ba$^{2+}$ and the anion YMO$_6^{-2}$, the Y-O stretching motion and
the stretching vibration of the MoO$_6$ octahedron, respectively. These modes
continue to harden upon cooling owing to the shrink of the lattice constant.
When the temperature decreases to $T \leq$ 130 K around which the spin singlet

surface was cleaned by ion beam etching and the SSRM surface conductivity map
has been subsequently repeatedly measured over several hours in air and pure
nitrogen. Average surface conductivity of the scanned area was gradually
decreasing over time in both cases, faster in air. This was explained by oxygen
out-diffusion in both cases and chemical reactions with water vapor in air. The
obtained surface conductivity images also revealed its high inhomogenity on
micrometer and nanometer scale with numerous regions of highly enhanced
conductivity compared to the surroundings. Furthermore, it has been shown that
the size of these conductive regions considerably depends on the applied

caused by varying thickness of degraded YBCO surface layer as well as varying
oxygen concentration (x parameter) within this layer, what was confirmed by
scanning Auger electron microscopy (SAM). In our opinion the presented findings
might be important for analysis of current-voltage and differential
characteristics measured on classical planar junctions on YBCO as well as other

observations from the Very Large Telescope MID-infrared Interferometric
instrument (VLTI/MIDI) of a very well studied carbon-rich giant: TX Psc. The
aim of this work is to determine stellar parameters using spectroscopy and
interferometry. The observations are used to constrain the model atmosphere,
and eventually the stellar evolutionary model in the region where the tracks
map the beginning of the carbon star sequence. Two different approaches are
used to determine stellar parameters: (i) the 'classic' interferometric
approach where the effective temperature is fixed by using the angular diameter
in the N-band (from interferometry) and the apparent bolometric magnitude; (ii)
parameters are obtained by fitting a grid of state-of-the-art hydrostatic
models to spectroscopic and interferometric observations. We find a good
agreement between the parameters of the two methods. The effective temperature
and luminosity clearly place TX Psc in the carbon-rich AGB star domain in the
H-R-diagram. Current evolutionary tracks suggest that TX Psc became a C-star
just recently, which means that the star is still in a 'quiet' phase compared
to the subsequent strong-wind regime. This is in agreement with the C/O ratio
being only slightly larger than 1.

observed in alloys with embedded nanoparticles, and it stresses the importance
of combining alloy and nanosized scatterers simultaneously to minimize thermal

conditions as well.) We are interested in the competition between the energy
that should be minimized due to the small noise strength and the entropy that
is induced by the large system size.
  Our methods handle system sizes that are exponential with respect to the
inverse noise strength, up to the critical exponential size predicted by the
heuristics. We capture the competition between energy and entropy through upper
and lower bounds on the probability of extra transitions between -1 and 1.
These bounds are sharp on the exponential scale and imply in particular that
the probability of having one and only one transition from -1 to +1 is
exponentially close to one. In addition, we show that the position of the
transition layer is uniformly distributed over the system on scales larger than
the logarithm of the inverse noise strength.

width (W_Li = 430 +- 20 mAA) for FUTau A. From the rotational velocity and the
published period we infer a disk inclination of i ~ 50^deg. The lithium content
is much lower than theoretically expected for such a young very low mass
object, adding another puzzling feature to this object's properties. We
determine the mass accretion rate of FU Tau A from comparison of the
luminosities of 24 emission lines to empirical calibrations from the literature
and find a mean of log (dM/dt)_acc [M_sun/yr] = -9.9 +- 0.2. The accretion rate
determined independently from modeling of the excess emission in the Balmer and
Paschen continua is consistent with this value. The corresponding accretion
luminosity is too small to make a significant contribution to the bolometric
luminosity. The existence of an outflow in FU Tau A is demonstrated through the
first detection of forbidden emission lines from which we obtain an estimate
for the mass loss rate, log (dM/dt)_out [M_sun/yr] < -10.4. The mass outflow

expanding the dictionary with grouped elements and imposing a structured
sparsity assumption that the combinations within each group should be sparse or
even 1-sparse. If the dictionary is highly coherent, it is difficult to obtain
good solutions using convex or greedy methods, such as non-negative least

Hoyer measure, which is the ratio of the $l_1$ and $l_2$ norms, as sparsity
penalties to be added to the objective in NNLS-type models. For solving the
resulting nonconvex models, we propose a scaled gradient projection algorithm
that requires solving a sequence of strongly convex quadratic programs. We
discuss its close connections to convex splitting methods and difference of
convex programming. We also present promising numerical results for example
DOAS analysis and hyperspectral demixing problems.

with inhomogeneously distributed discrete structures (galaxies, groups and
clusters of galaxies). Supposing that the Universe contains also the
cosmological constant and a perfect fluid with a negative constant equation of
state (EoS) parameter $\omega$ (e.g., quintessence, phantom or frustrated
network of topological defects), we investigate scalar perturbations of the FRW
metrics due to inhomogeneities. Our analysis shows that, to be compatible with
the theory of scalar perturbations, this perfect fluid, first, should be
clustered and, second, should have the equation of state parameter
$\omega=-1/3$. In particular, this value corresponds to the frustrated network
of cosmic strings. Therefore, the frustrated network of domain walls with
$\omega =-2/3$ is ruled out. A perfect fluid with $\omega =-1/3$ neither
accelerates nor decelerates the Universe. We also obtain the equation for the
nonrelativistic gravitational potential created by a system of inhomogeneities.
Due to the perfect fluid with $\omega = -1/3$, the physically reasonable
solutions take place for flat, open and closed Universes. This perfect fluid is
concentrated around the inhomogeneities and results in screening of the
gravitational potential.

areas, is the necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a black hole to have
the hidden conformal symmetry. In particular, for the Einstein(-Maxwell)

assist blind people to independently access unfamiliar buildings. Most existing
algorithms of door detection are limited to work for familiar environments
because of restricted assumptions about color, texture and shape. In this paper
we propose a novel approach which employs feature based classification and uses
the Kohonen Self-Organizing Map (SOM) for the purpose of door detection.
Generic and stable features are used for the training of SOM that increase the
performance significantly: concavity, bottom-edge intensity profile and door
edges. To validate the robustness and generalizability of our method, we
collected a large dataset of real world door images from a variety of
environments and different lighting conditions. The algorithm achieves more
than 95% detection which demonstrates that our door detection method is generic
and robust with variations of color, texture, occlusions, lighting condition,
scales, and viewpoints.

of the Hirota-Satsuma coupled KdV (HS-cKdV) system, and infinitely many
nonlocal symmetries are obtained by introducing some internal parameters. By
extending the HS-cKdV system to an auxiliary system with five dependent
variables, the prolongation is found to localize the nonlocal symmetry related
to the DT. Base on the enlarged system, the finite symmetry transformations and
similarity reductions about the local symmetries are computed, which lead to
some novel exact solutions of the HS-cKdV system. These solutions contain some
new solutions from old ones by the finite symmetry transformation and exact
interaction solutions among solitons and other complicated waves including
periodic cnoidal waves and Painlev\'{e} waves through similarity reductions.
Some integrable models from the nonlocal symmetry related to the DT are
obtained in two aspects: the negative HS-cKdV hierarchy obtained by introducing
the internal parameter and integrable models both in lower and higher
dimensions given by restricting the symmetry constraints.

directly dissipating the proto-magnetar wind as suggested by Zhang, we here
suggest that the magnetar wind could push the ejecta launched during the merger

magnetar-powered ejecta, when interacting with the ambient medium, would
develop a bright broad-band afterglow due to synchrotron radiation. We study
this physical scenario in detail, and present the predicted X-ray, optical and

the X-ray and optical lightcurves usually peak around the magnetar spindown
time scale (10^3-10^5s), reaching brightness readily detectable by wide-field
X-ray and optical telescopes, and remain detectable for an extended period. The
radio afterglow peaks later, but is much brighter than the case without a
magnetar energy injection. Therefore, such bright broad-band afterglows, if
detected and combined with GWBs in the future, would be a probe of massive
millisecond magnetars and stiff equation-of-state for nuclear matter.

carried out for studying the long-term changes of the surface activity of DP
CVn. Surface differential rotation of DP CVn is estimated from
cross-correlating the available subsequent Doppler reconstructions separated by
roughly one rotation period. Both stars appear to have higher than normal
lithium abundance, LTE log n of 2.28 (DP CVn) and 2.20 (DI Psc), and are
supposed to be located at the end of the first Li dredge-up on the RGB.
Photometric observations reveal rotational modulation with a period of 14.010 d

mapping lines well agree in the revealed spot patterns, recovering rather low
latitude spots for both stars with temperature contrasts of Delta T ~ 600-800 K
below the unspotted photospheric background. Spots at higher latitudes are also
found but either with less contrast (DP CVn) or with smaller extent (DI Psc). A
preliminary antisolar-type differential rotation with alpha=-0.035 is found for
DP CVn from cross-correlating the subsequent Doppler images. Long-term
photometric analysis supports the existence of active longitudes, as well as

primordial structures that coalesced to form giant galaxies like the Milky Way.
An early analysis noted that dwarf galaxies may not be isotropically
distributed around our Galaxy, as several are correlated with streams of HI
emission, and possibly form co-planar groups. These suspicions are supported by
recent analyses, and it has been claimed that the apparently planar
distribution of satellites is not predicted within standard cosmology, and
cannot simply represent a memory of past coherent accretion. However, other
studies dispute this conclusion. Here we report the existence (99.998%
significance) of a planar sub-group of satellites in the Andromeda galaxy,
comprising approximately 50% of the population. The structure is vast: at least
400 kpc in diameter, but also extremely thin, with a perpendicular scatter
<14.1 kpc (99% confidence). Radial velocity measurements reveal that the
satellites in this structure have the same sense of rotation about their host.
This finding shows conclusively that substantial numbers of dwarf satellite
galaxies share the same dynamical orbital properties and direction of angular
momentum, a new insight for our understanding of the origin of these most dark
matter dominated of galaxies. Intriguingly, the plane we identify is
approximately aligned with the pole of the Milky Way's disk and is co-planar
with the Milky Way to Andromeda position vector. The existence of such
extensive coherent kinematic structures within the halos of massive galaxies is
a fact that must be explained within the framework of galaxy formation and
cosmology.

BZ Cam were acquired on 9 nights in 2005-2006 in order to study the time
development of episodes of wind activity known to occur frequently in this
star. We confirm past results that the P-Cygni absorption components of the
lines mostly evolve from a higher expansion velocity to lower velocity as an
episode progresses. We also commonly find blueshifted emission components in
the Halpha line profile, whose velocities and durations strongly suggest that
they are also due to the wind. We suggest that the progression from larger to
smaller expansion velocities is due the higher velocity portions of a wind
concentration moving beyond the edge of the continuum light of the disk first,
leaving a net redward shift of the remaining absorption profile. We also derive
a new orbital ephemeris for BZ Cam, using the radial velocity of the core of
the HeI 5876AA line, finding P = 0.15353(4). Using this period the wind
episodes in BZ Cam are found to be concentrated near inferior conjuction of the
emission line source. This result confirms that the winds in nova-like CVs are
often phase dependent, in spite of the puzzling implication that such winds
lack axisymmetry. We argue that the radiation-driven wind in BZ Cam receives an
initial boost by acting on gas that has been lifted above the disk by the
interaction of the accretion stream with the disk, thereby imposing flickering
time scales onto the wind events, as well as leading to an orbital modulation
of the wind due to the non-axisymmetric nature of the stream/disk interaction.

it does not require centralized scheduling at the internal switch fabrics. In
this paper we reexamine the architecture, motivated by its potential to turn
off multiple components and thereby conserve energy in the presence of low
traffic.
  We perform a detailed analysis of the queue and delay performance of a
Load-Balanced Router under a simple random routing algorithm. We calculate
probabilistic bounds for queue size and delay, and show that the probabilities
drop exponentially with increasing queue size or delay. We also demonstrate a
tradeoff in energy consumption against the queue and delay performance.

offer a different view of overlays: it resembles the definition of paracompact
spaces via star refinements of open covers. One introduces covering structures
for covering maps and $p:X\to Y$ is an overlay if it has a covering structure
that has a star refinement.
  We prove two characterizations of overlays: one using existence and
uniqueness of lifts of discrete chains, the second as maps inducing simplicial
coverings of nerves of certain covers. We use those characterizations to
improve results of Eda-Matijevi\' c concerning topological group structures on
domains of overlays whose range is a compact topological group.
  In case of surjective maps $p:X\to Y$ between connected metrizable spaces we
characterize overlays as local isometries: $p:X\to Y$ is an overlay if and only
if one can metrize $X$ and $Y$ in such a way that $p|B(x,1):B(x,1)\to

especially when, due to a too high density of cars, the network of streets of a
city becomes blocked, and consequently, pedestrians, bicycles, and cars start
sharing the same traffic conditions potentially leading to high irritations (of
people) and therefore to chaos. In this paper we focus our attention on a
simple scenario: We model the driver's irritation induced by the presence of a
roadblock. As a natural generalization, we extend the model for the two one-way
crossroads traffic presented by M.E. Fouladvand and M. Nematollahi to that of a
roadblock. Our discrete model defines and minimizes the total waiting time. The
novelty lies in introducing the (total) driver's irritation and its
minimization. Finally, we apply our model to a real-world situation: rush hour
traffic in Hillegom, The Netherlands. We observe that minimizing the total
waiting time and minimizing the total driver's irritation lead to different
traffic light strategies.

proof of Theorem1 in Section5. Proposition1 is proved with the aid of Euclid's

Sections3 and4, we focus on the special case b^2-4c=0; which implies b=2d and
c=d^2, for some integer d. If d and a are distinct; then there are finitely
many integral points, parametrically described in Results1 and2. Theorem1 in
Sec.5 deals with the general case.Accordingly, if a^2-ab+c is not zero; there
are exactly 4N distinct integral points parametrically described.Except in the
cases where a^2-ab+c is a perfect square, or minus a perfect square; in which
cases thare are exactly 4N-2 distinct integral points. Here N stands for the
number of positive divisors, not exceeding the square root of the absolute

Th.2, which is a direct application of Th.1 in the cases where the above

when foundation are laid and start carrying the weight of the structure. Its
application is traditionally based on Taylor's solution that approximates
experimental results by introducing non-theoretical variables that, however,
contradict the actual behaviou of soils. After careful examination of the
theoretical and experimental aspects connected with consolidation, the proposal
of this research is a solution consisting in a non-linear equation that can be
considered correct as it meets both mathematical and experimental requirements.
The solution proposed is extended to include differential equations relating to
two/three dimensional consolidation by adopting a transversally isotropic model
more consistent with the inner structure of soils. Finally, this essay is
complete with application examples that give more reliable results than the

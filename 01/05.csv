that allows studying the optical response of a broad range of dielectric
photonic structures. This method is particularly suitable for dealing with
complex biological structures. One of the main features of the proposed
approach is the simple and intuitive way of defining the setup and the photonic
structure to be simulated, which can be done by feeding the simulation with a
digital image of the structure. We also develop a set of techniques to process
the behavior of the evolving waves within the simulation. These techniques
include a direction filter, that permits decoupling of waves travelling
simultaneously in different directions, a dynamic differential absorber, to
cancel the waves reflected at the edges of the simulation space, a
multi-frequency excitation scheme based on a filter that allows decoupling
waves of different wavelengths travelling simultaneously, and a
near-to-far-field approach to evaluate the resulting wavefield outside the
simulation domain. We validate the code and, as an example, apply it to the
complex structure found in a microorganism called Diachea leucopoda, which
exhibits a multicolor iridescent appearance.

Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) become increasingly obscured by extragalactic
foregounds and secondary CMB signals. We present results from a nine-parameter
model describing these secondary effects, including the thermal and kinematic
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ and kSZ) power; the clustered and Poisson-like power
from Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) sources, and their frequency scaling; the

thermal dust emission from Galactic cirrus in two different regions of the sky.

different radio source levels and Galactic cirrus emission, the same model
provides an excellent fit to both datasets simultaneously, with chi2/dof=

to estimate the CMB power spectrum from ACT in bandpowers, marginalizing over

  multi-planetary systems","15 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ",,"10.1088/0004-637X/778/1/7",,"astro-ph.EP astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Kepler mission is dramatically increasing the number of planets known in
multi-planetary systems. Many adjacent planets have orbital period ratios near
resonant values, with a tendency to be larger than required for exact
first-order mean-motion resonances. This intriguing feature has been shown to
be a natural outcome of orbital circularization of resonant planetary pairs due
to star-planet tidal interactions. However, this feature holds in
multi-planetary systems with periods longer than ten days, for which tidal
circularization is unlikely to provide efficient divergent evolution of the
planets orbits. Gravitational interactions between planets and their parent
protoplanetary disk may instead provide efficient divergent evolution. For a
planet pair embedded in a disk, we show that interactions between a planet and
the wake of its companion can reverse convergent migration, and significantly
increase the period ratio from a near-resonant value. Divergent evolution due
to wake-planet interactions is particularly efficient when at least one of the
planets opens a partial gap around its orbit. This mechanism could help account
for the diversity of period ratios in Kepler's multiple systems comprising
super-Earth to sub-jovian planets with periods greater than about ten days.
Diversity is also expected for planet pairs massive enough to merge their gap.
The efficiency of wake-planet interactions is then much reduced, but convergent
migration may stall with a variety of period ratios depending on the density
structure in the common gap. This is illustrated for the Kepler-46 system, for
which we reproduce the period ratio of Kepler-46b and c.

um photometry from the Spitzer Space Telescope. Our sample consists of 14
clusters detected by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), which span the
redshift range 0.27 < z < 1.07 (median z = 0.50), and have dynamical mass
measurements, accurate to about 30 per cent, with median M500 = 6.9 x 10^{14}
MSun. We measure the 3.6 um and 4.5 um galaxy luminosity functions, finding the
characteristic magnitude (m*) and faint-end slope (alpha) to be similar to
those for IR-selected cluster samples. We perform the first measurements of the
scaling of SZ-observables (Y500 and y0) with both brightest cluster galaxy
(BCG) stellar mass and total cluster stellar mass (M500star). We find a
significant correlation between BCG stellar mass and Y500 (E(z)^{-2/3} DA^2
Y500 ~ M*^{1.2 +/- 0.6}), although we are not able to obtain a strong
constraint on the slope of the relation due to the small sample size.
Additionally, we obtain E(z)^{-2/3} DA^2 Y500 ~ M500star^{1.0 +/- 0.6} for the
scaling with total stellar mass. The mass fraction in stars spans the range
0.006-0.034, with the second ranked cluster in terms of dynamical mass (ACT-CL
J0237-4939) having an unusually low total stellar mass and the lowest stellar
mass fraction. For the five clusters with gas mass measurements available in
the literature, we see no evidence for a shortfall of baryons relative to the
cosmic mean value.

microscopic off-shell Hadron-String-Dynamics (HSD) transport approach, the
Isospin Quantum Molecular Dynamics (IQMD) approach as well as the
Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) approach. We confirm the
experimentally observed enhancement of the dilepton yield (normalized to the
multiplicity of neutral pions $N_{\pi^0}$) in heavy-ion collisions with respect
to that measured in $NN = (pp+pn)/2$ collisions. We identify two contributions
to this enhancement: a) the $pN$ bremsstrahlung which scales with the number of
collisions and not with the number of participants, i.e. pions; b) the dilepton
emission from intermediate $\Delta$'s which are part of the reaction cycles
$\Delta \to \pi N ; \pi N \to \Delta$ and $NN\to N\Delta; N\Delta \to NN$. With
increasing system size more generations of intermediate $\Delta$'s are created.
If such $\Delta$ decays into a pion, the pion can be reabsorbed, however, if it
decays into a dilepton, the dilepton escapes from the system. Thus,
experimentally one observes only one pion (from the last produced $\Delta$)
whereas the dilepton yield accumulates the contributions from all $\Delta$'s of
the cycle. We show as well that the Fermi motion enhances the production of
pions and dileptons in the same way. Furthermore, employing the off-shell HSD
approach, we explore the influence of in-medium effects like the modification
of self-energies and spectral functions of the vector mesons due to their
interactions with the hadronic environment.

demonstrate that noise alone is sufficient to synchronize nonidentical

Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) via thermal mixing under the hypothesis of
highly effective electron-electron interaction. When the electron and nuclear
reservoirs are also assumed to be in strong thermal contact and the microwave
irradiation saturates the target electron transition, the enhancement of the
nuclear polarization is expected to be considerably high even if the
irradiation frequency is set far away from the centre of the ESR line (as
already observed by Borghini) and the typical polarization time is reduced on
moving towards the boundaries of said line. More reasonable behaviours are
obtained by reducing the level of microwave saturation or the contact between
electrons and nuclei in presence of nuclear leakage. In both cases the function
describing the dependency of the steady state nuclear polarization on the
frequency of irradiation becomes sharper at the edges and the build up rate
decreases on moving off-resonance. If qualitatively similar in terms of the
effects produced on nuclear polarization, the degree of microwave saturation
and of electron-nucleus contact has a totally different impact on electron
polarization, which is of course strongly correlated to the effectiveness of
saturation and almost insensitive, at the steady state, to the magnitude of the
interactions between the two spin reservoirs. The likelihood of the different
scenario is discussed in the light of the experimental data currently available
in literature, to point out which aspects are suitably accounted and which are
not by the declinations of thermal mixing DNP considered here.

and for the commonly used laser photon energy from 1.5 eV to 3.0 eV. The strain
rate and dispersion rate of the 2D subbands are derived and tabulated. In
particular, these two quantities show large variations up to 50%. The results

demonstrate the benefit of ""borrowing strength"" in the inference of multiple
groups of data - a powerful insight often invoked to motivate hierarchical
modeling. In certain settings, the gain in efficiency due to the latent
hierarchy can be dramatic, improving from a standard nonparametric rate to a
parametric rate of convergence. Tools developed include transportation
distances for nonparametric Bayesian hierarchies of random measures, the
existence of tests for Dirichlet measures, and geometric properties of the

models for studying the structure and dynamics of complex systems found in
nature, society, or technology. Recently, it has been pointed out that many
real-world complex systems are more adequately mapped by networks of
interacting or interdependent networks, e.g., a power grid showing
interdependency with a communication network. Additionally, in many real-world
situations it is reasonable to include node weights into complex network
statistics to reflect the varying size or importance of subsystems that are
represented by nodes in the network of interest. E.g., nodes can represent
vastly different surface area in climate networks, volume in brain networks or
economic capacity in trade networks. In this letter, combining both ideas, we
derive a novel class of statistical measures for analysing the structure of
networks of interacting networks with heterogeneous node weights. Using a
prototypical spatial network model, we show that the newly introduced
node-weighted interacting network measures indeed provide an improved
representation of the underlying system's properties as compared to their
unweighted analogues. We apply our method to study the complex network
structure of cross-boundary trade between European Union (EU) and non-EU
countries finding that it provides important information on trade balance and
economic robustness.

For a paradigmatic continuous-time model system, the transitivity properties of

also commonly invoked to explain the low metal content of dwarf galaxies. Our
main aim in this paper is to show that galactic mass cannot be the only
parameter determining the fraction of metals lost by a galaxy. In particular,
the distribution of gas must play an equally important role. We perform 2-D
chemo-dynamical simulations of galaxies characterized by different gas
distributions, masses and gas fractions. The gas distribution can change the
fraction of lost metals through galactic winds by up to one order of magnitude.
In particular, disk-like galaxies tend to loose metals more easily than
roundish ones. Consequently, also the final metallicities attained by models
with the same mass but with different gas distributions can vary by up to one
dex. Confirming previous studies, we also show that the fate of gas and freshly
produced metals strongly depends on the mass of the galaxy. Smaller galaxies
(with shallower potential wells) more easily develop large-scale outflows,
therefore the fraction of lost metals tends to be higher.

of fractional linear polarization in the regime where the Zeeman frequency
(gOmega) is greater than the stimulated emission rate (R) and the decay rate of
the molecular state (Gamma). We have used a radiative transfer code to
calculate the fractional linear polarization as a function of the emerging
brightness temperature for a number of rotational transition of SiO, H2O and
HCN which have been observed to display maser emission at submillimetre
wavelengths. We assume typical magnetic field strengths measured towards
galactic star forming regions and circumstellar envelopes of late-type stars
from previous VLBI observations. Since the Land\'e g-factors have not been
reported for the different rotational transitions we have modeled, we performed
our calculations assuming conservative values of the Zeeman frequency for the
different molecular species. Setting a lower limit for the Zeeman frequency
which still satisfies the criteria gOmega>R and gOmega>Gamma, we find
fractional polarization levels of up to 13%, 14% and 19% for the higher J
transitions analysed for SiO, H2O and HCN, respectively, without considering
anisotropic pumping or any other non-Zeeman effect. Such upper limits were
calculated assuming a magnetic field oriented perpendicular to the direction of
propagation of the maser radiation. According to our results SiO, H2O and HCN
maser emission within the ALMA frequency range can be detected with suitable
linear polarization to trace the magnetic field structure towards star forming
regions and late-type stars, even if the detected polarization has been
enhanced by non-Zeeman effects.

overlapping SDSS Stripe 82 is estimated to be 90% complete for M_500c > 4.5e14
Msun and 0.15 < z < 0.8. While matched filters are used to detect the clusters,
the sample is studied further through a ""Profile Based Amplitude Analysis""
using a single filter at a fixed \theta_500 = 5.9' angular scale. This new
approach takes advantage of the ""Universal Pressure Profile"" (UPP) to fix the
relationship between the cluster characteristic size (R_500) and the integrated
Compton parameter (Y_500). The UPP scalings are found to be nearly identical to
an adiabatic model, while a model incorporating non-thermal pressure better
matches dynamical mass measurements and masses from the South Pole Telescope. A
high signal to noise ratio subsample of 15 ACT clusters is used to obtain
cosmological constraints. We first confirm that constraints from SZ data are
limited by uncertainty in the scaling relation parameters rather than sample
size or measurement uncertainty. We next add in seven clusters from the ACT
Southern survey, including their dynamical mass measurements based on galaxy
velocity dispersions. In combination with WMAP7 these data simultaneously
constrain the scaling relation and cosmological parameters, yielding \sigma_8 =
0.829 \pm 0.024 and \Omega_m = 0.292 \pm 0.025. The results include
marginalization over a 15% bias in dynamical mass relative to the true halo
mass. In an extension to LCDM that incorporates non-zero neutrino mass density,
we combine our data with WMAP7+BAO+Hubble constant measurements to constrain
\Sigma m_\nu < 0.29 eV (95% C. L.).

including its p0 (central pressure), p1/p0 (core-mantle boundary pressure over
central pressure), CMF (core mass fraction) or CRF (core radius fraction). For
the 3-layer model, a curve segment on the ternary diagram represents all
possible relative mass proportions of the 3 layers for a given mass-radius
input. These ternary diagrams are tabulated into Table3 with the intent to make
comparison to observations easier. How the presence of Fe in the mantle affects
the mass-radius relations is also discussed in a separate section. A dynamic

interaction (CI) methods are based on a single orthonormal orbital basis (OB).
For atoms with complicated shell structures, a large OB is needed to saturate
all the electron correlation effects. The large OB leads to massive
configuration state function (CSF) expansions that are difficult to handle. We
show that it is possible to relax the orthonormality restriction on the OB and
break down the originally large calculations to a set of smaller ones that can
be run in parallel. Each calculation determines a partitioned correlation
function (PCF) that accounts for a specific correlation effect. The PCFs are
built on optimally localized orbital sets and are added to a zero-order
multireference (MR) function to form a total wave function. The mixing
coefficients of the PCFs are fixed from a small generalized eigenvalue problem.
The required matrices are computed using a biorthonormal transformation
technique. The new method, called partitioned correlation function interaction
(PCFI), converges rapidly and gives total energies that are lower than the
ordinary ones (MCHF and CI). Considering Li I, we show that by dedicating a PCF
to the single excitations from the core highly improves the convergence
patterns of the hyperfine parameters. Collecting the optimized PCFs to correct
the MR function, the variational degrees of freedom in the relative mixing
coefficients of the CSFs building the PCFs are inhibited. These constraints
lead to small off-sets in computed properties other than total energy, with
respect to the correct values. By (partially) deconstraining the mixing
coefficients one converges to the correct limits and keeps the important
advantage in the convergence rates. Reducing ultimately each PCF to a single
CSF with its own OB leads to a non-orthogonal CI approach. Various perspectives
of the new method are given.

rise to such defect modes, and are associated with the emergence of discrete
eigenvalues from the continuous spectrum. Since these isolated eigenvalues are
located near a spectral band edge, there is strong scale-separation between the
medium period and the localization length of the defect mode. Bound states
therefore have a multi-scale structure: a ""carrier Bloch wave"" times a ""wave
envelope"", which is governed by a homogenized Schr\""odinger operator with
associated effective mass, depending on the spectral band edge which is the
site of the bifurcation. Our analysis is based on a reformulation of the
eigenvalue problem in Bloch quasi-momentum space, using the Gelfand-Bloch
transform and a Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction to a closed equation for the
near-band-edge frequency components of the bound state. A rescaling of the
latter equation yields the homogenized effective equation for the wave
envelope, and approximations to bifurcating eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.

radiation pressure. We study mergers of systems from SMC-like dwarfs and Milky
Way analogues to z~2 starburst disks. Multi-phase super-winds are generated in
all passages, with outflow rates up to ~1000 M_sun/yr. However, the wind
mass-loading efficiency (outflow rate divided by SFR) is similar to that in
isolated galaxy counterparts of each merger: it depends more on global galaxy
properties (mass, size, escape velocity) than on the dynamical state of the
merger. Winds tend to be bi- or uni-polar, but multiple 'events' build up
complex morphologies with overlapping, differently-oriented bubbles/shells at a
range of radii. The winds have complex velocity and phase structure, with
material at a range of speeds up to ~1000 km/s, and a mix of molecular,
ionized, and hot gas that depends on galaxy properties and different feedback
mechanisms. These simulations resolve a problem in some 'sub-grid' models,
where simple wind prescriptions can dramatically suppress merger-induced
starbursts. But despite large mass-loading factors (>~10) in the winds, the
peak SFRs are comparable to those in 'no wind' simulations. Wind acceleration
does not act equally, so cold dense gas can still lose angular momentum and
form stars, while blowing out gas that would not have participated in the
starburst in the first place. Considerable wind material is not unbound, and
falls back on the disk at later times post-merger, leading to higher
post-starburst SFRs in the presence of stellar feedback. This may require AGN
feedback to explain galaxy quenching.

planets. This goal requires knowledge of the incidence of false positives such
as eclipsing binaries in the background of the targets, or physically bound to
them, which can mimic the photometric signal of a transiting planet. We perform
numerical simulations to predict the occurrence of astrophysical false
positives detectable by the Mission, and quantify the fraction of them that
would pass the Kepler candidate vetting procedure. By comparing their
distribution with that of the Kepler Objects of Interest detected during the
first six quarters of operation of the spacecraft, we infer the false positive
rate of Kepler and study its dependence on spectral type, candidate planet
size, and orbital period. We find that the global false positive rate of Kepler
is 9.4 %, peaking for giant planets (6-22 Earth radii) at 17.7 %, reaching a
low of 6.7 % for small Neptunes (2-4 Earth radii), and increasing again for
Earth-size planets (0.8-1.25 Earth radii) to 12.3 %.
  Most importantly, we also quantify and characterize the distribution and rate
of occurrence of planets down to Earth size with no prior assumptions on their
frequency, by subtracting from the population of actual Kepler candidates our
simulated population of astrophysical false positives. We find that 16.5 +/-
3.6 % of main-sequence FGK stars have at least one planet between 0.8 and 1.25
Earth radii with orbital periods up to 85 days. There is no significant
dependence of the rates of planet occurrence between 0.8 and 4 Earth radii with
spectral type. In the process, we derive also a prescription for the signal
recovery rate of Kepler that enables a good match to both the KOI size and
orbital period distribution, as well as their signal-to-noise distribution.

its picturesque equatorial ring (ER) has been shocked, giving rise to a
growing, dominant narrow-lined component. Even so, current HETG and RGS
observations show that a broad component is still present and contributes 20%
of the 0.5--2 keV flux. SN 1987A's X-ray behavior can be modeled with a minimum
of free parameters as the sum of two simple 1D hydrodynamic simulations: i) an
on-going interaction with H II region material producing the broad emission
lines and most of the 3--10 keV flux, and ii) an interaction with the dense,
clumpy ER material that dominates the 0.5--2 keV flux. Toward the future, we
predict a continued growth of the broad component but a drop in the 0.5--2 keV
flux, once no new dense ER material is being shocked. When? Time, and new data,

technique is considered in relation to wind-blow bubbles. In the context of
spherical winds with azimuthal or split monopole stellar magnetic field
geometries, we derive maps of the distribution of position angle (PA) rotation
of linearly polarized radiation across projected bubbles. We show that the
morphology of maps for split monopole fields are distinct from those produced
by the toroidal field topology; however, the toroidal case is the one most
likely to be detectable because of its slower decline in field strength with
distance from the star. We also consider the important case of a bubble with a
spherical sub-volume that is field-free to approximate crudely a ""swept-up""
wind interaction between a fast wind (or possibly a supernova ejecta shell)
overtaking a slower magnetized wind from a prior state of stellar evolution.
With an azimuthal field, the resultant PA map displays two arc-like features of
opposite rotation measure, similar to observations of the supernova remnant

human generated traffic. Second, M2M constitutes a number of battery operated
devices that are static in locations such as basements and tunnels, and need to
transmit at elevated powers compared to the traditional devices. Third,
replacing or recharging batteries of such devices may not be feasible. All
these differences highlight the importance of a systematic framework to study
the power and energy optimal system design in the regime of interest for M2M,
which is the main focus of this paper. For a variety of coordinated and
uncoordinated transmission strategies, we derive results for the optimal
transmit power, energy per bit, and the maximum load supported by the base
station, leading to the following design guidelines: (i) frequency division
multiple access (FDMA), including equal bandwidth allocation, is sum-power
optimal in the asymptotically low spectral efficiency regime, (ii) while FDMA
is the best practical strategy overall, uncoordinated code division multiple
access (CDMA) is almost as good when the base station is lightly loaded, (iii)
the value of optimization within FDMA is in general not significant in the
regime of interest for M2M.

translates Omega(t) deterministic lower bounds on KW games to 2^Omega(t/log n)

general networks with a deep trap. However, it is still not well understood in
which networks this minimal scaling can be reached. Particularly, explicit

lacking, in spite that such networks shed light on the design for optimal

located at the root, a peripheral node, a neighbor of the root with a single

dominating scalings of ATT can reach the predicted minimum scalings. This work
deepens the understanding of behavior of trapping in scale-free networks, and

adjusts the cluster-head radius considering the residual energy and distance to

tokamak is important for the high confinement regimes, in particular in reactor
regime. The sudden onset of closed convection structures in the poloidal
section, due to the baroclinic production of vorticity, will sustain a fast
increase of the poloidal velocity and a substantial effect on the toroidal
rotation. However this is limited to the short time of the onset transition. In
real plasma however there is random generation and suppression of convection
cells and the sequence of these transient events can prove able to sustain the
effect on the toroidal rotation. We formulate a simplified model which consists
of a laminar sheared, regular, flow situated at the boundary of a region of
drift-wave turbulence. Vortical structures, randomly generated in this
turbulent region are spontaneously advected toward the flow and are absorbed
there, sustaining with their vortical content, the sheared flow. We examine
this dynamics in the wavenumber $\mathbf{k}$ space, using reasonable
approximations. We derive a system of equations (which is a class of
Davey-Stewartson system) and find that indeed, the vortices advected and
absorbed into the layer can preserve its regular, poloidal, flow.

methods and measured the CME heights for a set of 32 metric type II bursts from
solar cycle 24. We minimized the projection effects by making the measurements
from a view that is roughly orthogonal to the direction of the ejection. We
also chose image frames close to the onset times of the type II bursts, so no
extrapolation was necessary. We found that the CMEs were located in the
heliocentric distance range from 1.20 to 1.93 solar radii (Rs), with mean and
median values of 1.43 and 1.38 Rs, respectively. We conclusively find that the
shock formation can occur at heights substantially below 1.5 Rs. In a few
cases, the CME height at type II onset was close to 2 Rs. In these cases, the
starting frequency of the type II bursts was very low, in the range 25 to 40
MHz, which confirms that the shock can also form at larger heights. The
starting frequencies of metric type II bursts have a weak correlation with the
measured CME/shock heights and are consistent with the rapid decline of density
with height in the inner corona.

optimal $\Lambda$CDM model fits the GRB Hubble Diagram with a reduced
$\chi^2_{\rm dof}\approx 2.26$, whereas the fit using $R_{\rm h}=ct$ results in
a $\chi^2_{\rm dof}\approx 2.14$. In both cases, about 20% of the events lie at

contamination by non-standard GRB luminosities is unavoidable, or that the
errors and intrinsic scatter associated with the data are being underestimated.

  Methods. We analyze the light curves and study the color-color diagrams via
comparison with the standard reddening path. We examine the structure of the
molecular cloud hosting V2492 Cyg by computing temperature and optical depth
maps from the far-infrared data.
  Results. We find that the shapes of the light curves at different wavelengths
are strictly self-similar and that the observed variability is related to a
single physical process, most likely variable extinction. We suggest that the
central source is episodically occulted by a dense dust cloud in the inner
disk, and, based on the invariability of the far-infrared fluxes, we propose
that it is a long-lived rather than a transient structure. In some respects,
V2492 Cyg can be regarded as a young, embedded analog of UX Orionis-type stars.
  Conclusions. The example of V2492 Cyg demonstrates that the light variations
of young eruptive stars are not exclusively related to changing accretion. The
variability provided information on an azimuthally asymmetric structural
element in the inner disk. Such an asymmetric density distribution in the
terrestrial zone may also have consequences for the initial conditions of
planet formation.

popular matchings problem can be defined as follows: Let G = (A U P, E) be a
bipartite graph where A denotes a set of agents, P denotes a set of posts and
the edges in E are ranked. Each agent ranks a subset of posts in an order of
preference, possibly involving ties. A matching M is popular if there exists no
matching M' such that the number of agents that prefer M' to M exceeds the
number of agents that prefer M to M'. Consider a centralized market where
agents submit their preferences and a central authority matches agents to posts
according to the notion of popularity. Since a popular matching need not be
unique, we assume that the central authority chooses an arbitrary popular
matching. Let a1 be the sole manipulative agent who is aware of the true
preference lists of all other agents. The goal of a1 is to falsify her
preference list to get better always, that is, to improve the set of posts that
she gets matched to as opposed to what she got when she was truthful. We show
that the optimal cheating strategy for a single agent to get better always can
be computed in O(\sqrt{n}m) time when preference lists are allowed to contain
ties and in O(m+n) time when preference lists are all strict. Here n = |A| +
|P| and m = |E|.
  To compute the cheating strategies, we develop a switching graph
characterization of the popular matchings problem involving ties. The switching
graph characterization was studied for the case of strict lists by McDermid and
Irving (J. Comb. Optim. 2011) and it was open for the case of ties. The
switching graph characterization for the case of ties is of independent
interest and answers a part of the open questions posed by McDermid and Irving.

investment decisions, to continuous time. In a variety of scenarios, we show
how the investor's desired distribution combines with her initial wealth and

generalized Leibniz rule $u(a b) = u(a) b + a \, d(b)$ for all $a,b \in \cal

functions on a manifold. We then apply this machinery to study generalized
general relativity. We define the Einstein-Hilbert action and deduce from it
Einstein's field equations. We show that for a special class of metrics
containing, besides the usual metric components, only one nonzero term, the
action reduces to the O'Hanlon action that is the Brans-Dicke action with
potential and with the parameter $\omega$ equal to zero. We also show that the
generalized Einstein equations (with zero energy-stress tensor) are equivalent
to those of the Kaluza-Klein theory satisfying a ""modified cylinder condition""
and having a noncompact extra dimension. This opens a possibility to consider
Kaluza-Klein models with a noncompact extra dimension that remains invisible
for a macroscopic observer. In our approach, this extra dimension is not an
additional physical space-time dimension but appears because of the
generalization of the derivation concept.

time-dependent Ginzburg--Landau model, and the results are compared with the
Kibble--Zurek mechanism (KZM). The assumptions of KZM are formulated and
checked as three separate postulates. We find a characteristic length and
characteristic times for the processes we study. Besides the case of uniform
rings, we examined the case of rings with several weak links. For temperatures
close or below $T_c$, the coherence length does not characterize the
correlation length. In order to regard the winding number as a conserved
quantity, it is necessary to allow for a short lapse of time during which
unstable configurations decay. We found criteria for the validity of the 1D
treatment. The is no lower bound for final temperatures that permit 1D
treatment. For moderate quenching times $\tau_Q$, the variance of the winding
number obeys the scaling $< n^2>\propto \tau_Q^{-1/4}$, as predicted by KZM in
the case of mean field models; for $\tau_Q\alt 10^5\hbar /k_BT_c$, the
dependence is weaker. We also studied the behavior of the system when
fluctuations of the gauge field are suppressed, and obtained that the scaling

where do we start to answer such questions? In Chapters 1-3, I elaborate the
concept of worldview and argue that we should aim at constructing comprehensive

to any ultimate explanation. I conclude that our explanations tend to fall in
two cognitive attractors, the point or the cycle. In Chapter 5, I focus on the
free parameters issue, while Chapter 6 is a critical analysis of the
fine-tuning issue. I conclude that fine-tuning is a conjecture and that we need
to further study how typical our universe is. This opens a research endeavor
that I call artificial cosmogenesis. In Chapter 7, I show the importance of
artificial cosmogenesis from extrapolating the future of scientific
simulations. I then analyze two other evolutionary explanations of fine-tuning
in Chapter 8: Cosmological Natural Selection and the broader scenario of
Cosmological Artificial Selection. In Chapter 9, I inquire into the search for
extraterrestrials and conclude that some binary star systems are good
candidates. Since those putative beings feed on stars, I call them starivores.
The question of their artificiality remains open, but I propose a prize to
further continue and motivate the scientific assessment of this hypothesis. In

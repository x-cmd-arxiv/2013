  detectable supernova signal from Andromeda?","9 pages, 1 figure",,,,"astro-ph.CO astro-ph.HE hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  According to a 2007 paper there was no evidence for a neutrino burst of two
or more events in Super-Kamiokande (SK) during the entire period of data-taking
from 1996 to 2005 from Andromeda or anywhere else. There is, however a scenario
under which a detectable signal could have been missed given the search method
employed by the analysis, and it would have been found using an alternate
method. The alternate method depends on the hypothesis that two of the neutrino
mass eigenstates have masses 4.0 eV and 21.4 eV which was inferred from an
analysis of the SN 1987A data. Although one might argue that the hypothesis of
such large neutrino masses is remote, there is a way they could be compatible
with observed constraints on neutrino masses involving a third tachyonic
($m^2<0$) eigenstate, plus three sterile neutrinos. Given the importance of a
positive supernova search result, and the ease of conducting it using existing
SK data, there would seem to be little reason not to do it.

sufficiently rich formal theory T there exist true statements that are
unprovable in T. Such statements would be natural candidates for being added as
axioms, but how can we obtain them? One classical (and well studied) approach
is to add to some theory T an axiom that claims the consistency of T. In this
paper we discuss another approach motivated by Chaitin's version of G\""odel's
theorem where axioms claiming the randomness (or incompressibility) of some
strings are probabilistically added, and show that it is not really useful, in
the sense that this does not help us to prove new interesting theorems. This
result answers a question recently asked by Lipton. The situation changes if we
take into account the size of the proofs: randomly chosen axioms may help
making proofs much shorter, unless NP=PSPACE. We then study the axiomatic power
of the statements of type ""the Kolmogorov complexity of x exceeds n"" in
general. They are \Pi_1 (universally quantified) statements of Peano
arithmetic. We show that by adding all true statements of this type, we obtain
a theory that proves all true \Pi_1-statements, and also provide a more
detailed classification. In particular, to derive all true \Pi_1-statements it
is sufficient to add one statement of this type for each n (or even for
infinitely many n) if strings are chosen in a special way. On the other hand,
one may add statements of this type for most x of length n (for every n) and
still obtain a weak theory. We also study other logical questions related to
""random axioms"". Finally, we consider a theory that claims Martin-L\""of
randomness of a given infinite binary sequence. This claim can be formalized in
different ways. We show that different formalizations are closely related but
not equivalent, and study their properties.

almost removed and the gas bubble density was reduced significantly, resulting
in a doubled engineering critical current density (JE) of 810 A/mm2 at 5 T, 4.2

exceeds the rest mass energy, although the extension to massive particles

the description of dissipative effects, the Maxwell-Juettner distribution is
expanded in a basis of orthonormal polynomials, so as to correctly recover the
third order moment of the distribution function. In addition, a time dilatation
is also applied, in order to preserve the compatibility of the scheme with a
cartesian cubic lattice. To the purpose of comparing the present LB model with
previous ones, the time transformation is also applied to a lattice model which
recovers terms up to second order, namely up to energy-momentum tensor. The
approach is validated through quantitative comparison between the second and
third order schemes with BAMPS (the solution of the full relativistic Boltzmann
equation), for moderately high viscosity and velocities, and also with previous
LB models in the literature. Excellent agreement with BAMPS and more accurate
results than previous relativistic lattice Boltzmann models are reported.

strong lower limits on the spin temperature, $T_s \gtrsim 790$ K, similar to
the bulk of the high-$z$ DLA population; three other DLAs yield weak lower
limits, $T_s > 140-400$ K. However, for the two DLAs with detections of HI 21cm
absorption, the derived spin temperatures are both low $T_s = (160 \pm 35)

are the first two DLAs at $z > 1$ with $T_s$ values comparable to those
obtained in local spiral galaxies. Based on the observed correlations between
spin temperature and metallicity and velocity spread and metallicity in DLAs,
we suggest that the hosts of the two absorbers are likely to be massive,
high-metallicity galaxies.

benefits for whole-body imaging at 3 T, we compare numerical simulations at 1.5
T, 3 T, 7 T, and 9 T via the propagation of the parallel-plate waveguide
principal mode filled with a cylindrical phantom and two surface coils. B1
mapping was computed to investigate the feasibility of this approach at 3T. The
point spread function method was used to measure the imager performance for the
traveling-wave magnetic resonance imaging experiment. Human leg images were
acquired to experimentally validate this approach. The principal mode shows
very little field magnitude variations along the propagation direction at 3 T
when compared to other higher resonant frequencies. The B1 mapping showed that
it is possible to conduct experiments using the traveling-wave approach at 128

these type of experiments. Leg images were obtained with the whole-body

comprising a cavity or single-electron box capacitively coupled to a gate and
connected to a reservoir lead via several conducting channels. Depending on the
engineering details of the quantum RC circuit, the number of channels
contributing to transport vary, as do the form of the interchannel couplings.
For low-frequency AC transport, the charge-relaxation resistance ($R_{q}$) is a
nontrivial function of the parameters of the system. However, in the vicinity
of the charge degeneracy points and for weak tunneling, we find as a result of
cross-mode mixing or channel asymmetry that $R_q$ becomes universal for a
metallic cavity at low temperatures, and equals the unit of quantum resistance.
To prove this universality we map the system to an effective one-channel Kondo
model, and construct an analogy with the Coulomb gas. Next, we probe the
opposite regime of near-perfect transmission using a bosonization approach.
Focussing on the two-channel case, we study the effect of backscattering at the
lead-dot interface, more specifically, the role of an asymmetry in the
backscattering amplitudes, and make a connection with the weak tunneling regime
near the charge degeneracy points.

single-lined spectroscopic binaries with an early K giant as primary component
but in different stages of orbital-rotational synchronization. Our photometry

photospheric emission. For IS Vir, we detect a marginal mid-IR excess which
hints towards a dust disk. The orbital and rotational planes of IT Com appear
to be coplanar, contrary to previous findings in the literature. We apply a
multiple frequency analysis technique to determine photometric periods, and
possibly changes of periods, ranging from days to decades. New rotational
periods of 21.55+-0.03d, 65.1+-0.3d, and 23.50+-0.04d were determined for V2253
Oph, IT Com, and IS Vir, respectively. Splitting of these periods led to
tentative detections of differential surface rotations of delta P/P ~0.02 for
V2253 Oph and 0.07 for IT Com. Using a time-frequency technique based on
short-term Fourier transforms we present evidence of cyclic light variations of
length ~10yrs for V2253 Oph and 5-6yrs for IS Vir. A single flip-flop event has
been observed for IT Com of duration 2-3yrs. Its exchange of the dominant
active longitude had happened close to a time of periastron passage, suggesting
some response of the magnetic activity from the orbital dynamics. The 21.55-d
rotational modulation of V2253 Oph showed phase coherence also with the orbital

turbulence and thermal instability. Using low resolution simulations we
explored the impact of the WNM initial density and properties of the turbulence
(stirring in Fourier with a varying mix of solenoidal and compressive modes) on
the cold gas formation. Two sets of initial conditions which match the
observations were selected to produce high resolution simulations (1024^3)
allowing to study in details the properties of the produced dense structures.
For typical values of the density, pressure and velocity dispersion of the WNM
in the solar neighborhood, the turbulent motions of the HI can not provoque the
phase transition from WNM to CNM, whatever their amplitude and their
distribution in solenoidal and compressive modes. On the other hand we show
that a quasi-isothermal increase in WNM density of a factor of 2 to 4 is enough
to induce the phase transition, leading to the transition of about 40 percent
of the gas to the cold phase within 1 Myr. Given the observed properties of the
HI in the local ISM, the WNM and individual CNM structures in the local ISM are
sub or transsonic and their dynamics are tightly interwoven. The velocity field
bears the evidence of subsonic turbulence with a 2D power spectrum following
the Kolmogorov law as P(k) \sim k^{-8/3} while the density is highly contrasted
with a singificantly shallower power spectrum, reminiscent of what is observed
in the cold ISM. Supra-thermal line width observed for CNM might be the result
of relative velocity between cold structures. Finally, the cold structures
denser than 5 cm^{-3} reproduce well the laws M \sim L^{2.25-2.28} and sigma(v)

state is to transmit the classical description of the quantum state itself.
However, this requires an infinite amount of classical communication if the
simulation is exact. A more intriguing and potentially less demanding strategy
would encode the full information about the quantum state into the probability
distribution of the communicated variables, so that this information is never
sent in each single shot. This kind of simulation is called weak, as opposed to
strong simulations, where the quantum state is communicated in individual
shots. In this paper, we introduce a bounded-error weak protocol for simulating
the communication of an arbitrary number of qubits and a subsequent two-outcome
measurement consisting of an arbitrary pure state projector and its complement.
This protocol requires an amount of classical communication independent of the
number of qubits and proportional to Delta^{-1}, where Delta is the error and a
free parameter of the protocol. Conversely, a bounded-error strong protocol
requires an amount of classical communication growing exponentially with the
number of qubits for a fixed error. Our result improves a previous protocol,
based on the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, with communication cost scaling as
Delta^{-2} log Delta^{-1}.

Model (SM)-like Higgs boson mass in the type-II seesaw model. We find that, as
long as the seesaw scale is introduced below the SM vacuum instability bound,
there exists a large parameter space predicting a 125 GeV Higgs mass,
irrespective of the exact value of the seesaw scale, satisfying both stability
and unitarity conditions up to the Planck scale. We also study the model
predictions for the Higgs partial decay widths in the diphoton and Z+photon
channels with respect to their SM expectations and find that the decay rates
for these two processes are correlated. We further show that for any given
enhancement in the Higgs-to-diphoton rate over its SM expectation, there exists
an upper bound on the type-II seesaw scale, and hence, on the masses of the
associated doubly- and singly-charged Higgs bosons in the allowed parameter
space. For instance, if more than 10% enhancement persists in the
Higgs-to-diphoton channel, the upper limit on the type-II seesaw scale is about
450 GeV which is completely within the reach of the 14 TeV LHC. We believe this
to be an encouraging result for the experimental searches of the singly- and
doubly-charged Higgs bosons which, in combination with improved sensitivity in
the Higgs-to-diphoton and Higgs-to-Z+photon signal strengths, could probe the
entire allowed parameter space of the minimal type-II seesaw model, and
establish/eliminate it as a single viable extension of the SM.

predictions of the standard LCDM model. We assess the biases in our method,
stability of the error covariance matrix and possible systematic effects. We
fit the resulting correlation function with several models that decouple the

measure 100x(alpha_iso-1) = -1.6 ^{+2.0+4.3+7.4}_{-2.0-4.1-6.8} (stat.) +/- 1.0

(HP) lattice proteins interacting with attractive surfaces are studied by means
of Wang-Landau sampling. Three benchmark HP sequences (48mer, 67mer, and
103mer) are considered with different types of surfaces, each of which attract
either all monomers, only hydrophobic (H) monomers, or only polar (P) monomers,
respectively. The diversity of folding behavior in dependence of surface
strength is discussed. Analyzing the combined patterns of various structural
observables, such as, e.g., the derivatives of the numbers of surface contacts,
together with the specific heat, we are able to identify generic categories of
folding and transition hierarchies. We also infer a connection between these
transition categories and the relative surface strengths, i.e., the ratio of
the surface attractive strength to the interchain attraction among H monomers.
The validity of our proposed classification scheme is reinforced by the
analysis of additional benchmark sequences. We thus believe that the folding
hierarchies and identification scheme are generic for HP proteins interacting
with attractive surfaces, regardless of chain length, sequence, or surface
attraction.

potential yields a surface melting at $\simeq 700$ K very low with respect to
the experimental bulk melting at $\simeq 1235$ K while the GP yields a surface
melting at $\simeq 1000$ K closer to the bulk one. In addition, we observe with

frequency of cells blocked in S and G2/M stages and also of the apoptotic cells
at 96 hours from the treatment. After another 24 hours, the frequency of the

linear regressions in which one component is entirely known while the
proportion, the slope, the intercept and the error distribution of the other
component are unknown. In spite of good performance for datasets of reasonable
size, the method proposed in \cite{Van13} suffers from a serious drawback when
the sample size becomes large as it is based on the optimization of a contrast
function whose pointwise computation requires O(n^2) operations. The range of
applicability of the method derived in this work is substantially larger as it
relies on a method-of-moments estimator free of tuning parameters whose
computation requires O(n) operations. From a theoretical perspective, the
asymptotic normality of both the estimator of the Euclidean parameter vector
and of the semiparametric estimator of the c.d.f.\ of the error is proved under
weak conditions not involving zero-symmetry assumptions. In addition, an
approximate confidence band for the c.d.f.\ of the error can be computed using
a weighted bootstrap whose asymptotic validity is proved. The finite-sample
performance of the resulting estimation procedure is studied under various
scenarios through Monte Carlo experiments. The proposed method is illustrated
on three real datasets of size $n=150$, 51 and 176,343, respectively. Two
extensions of the considered model are discussed in the final section: a model
with an additional scale parameter for the first component, and a model with

described through a non-linear Walecka model and the just deconfined matter by
the MIT bag model including color superconductivity. Surface tension and
curvature energy are calculated self-consistently within the MRE formalism. We
impose flavour conservation during the transition, which means that the just
deconfined quark droplet is transiently out of equilibrium with respect to weak
interactions. Our results show that trapped neutrinos slightly increase the
critical density for deconfinement and that color superconductivity
significantly decreases such density at low temperatures. We also show that the
nucleation rate is negligible for droplets larger than 100-200 fm and is huge
for smaller droplets provided that the temperature is low enough. We compare
our results with previous calculations using the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with
color superconductivity and the MIT bag model without color superconductivity.
We conclude that the deconfinement transition should be triggered
instantaneously when a density slightly larger than the bulk transition density
is reached at some layer of a protoneutron star. Since color superconductivity
lowers the transition density at low temperatures, the transition is likely to
occur after significant cooling in a massive enough protoneutron star.

to be in dynamical equilibrium, it has recently been argued that such young
systems set examples where the early residual gas-expulsion did not happen or
had no dynamical effect. The intriguing scenario of a star cluster forming
through a single starburst has thereby been challenged. Choosing the case of
the R136 cluster of the Large Magellanic Cloud, the most cited one in this
context, we perform direct N-body computations that mimic the early evolution
of this cluster including the gas-removal phase (on a thermal timescale). Our
calculations show that under plausible initial conditions as consistent from
observational data, a large fraction (> 60%) of a gas-expelled, expanding
R136-like cluster is bound to regain dynamical equilibrium by its current age.
Therefore, the recent measurements of velocity dispersion in the inner regions
of R136, that indicate that the cluster is in dynamical equilibrium, are
consistent with an earlier substantial gas expulsion of R136 followed by a
rapid re-virialization (in approx. 1 Myr). Additionally, we find that the less
massive Galactic NGC 3603 Young Cluster (NYC), with a substantially longer
re-virialization time, is likely to be found deviated from dynamical
equilibrium at its present age (approx. 1 Myr). The recently obtained stellar
proper motions in the central part of the NYC indeed suggest this and are
consistent with the computed models. This work significantly extends previous
models of the Orion Nebula Cluster which already demonstrated that the
re-virialization time of young post-gas-expulsion clusters decreases with
increasing pre-expulsion density.

Millennium N-body Simulation; however, the Durham and Munich groups use
independent algorithms to construct halo merger histories. We compare the
predicted halo occupation distributions (HODs) and correlation functions for
galaxy samples defined by stellar mass, cold gas mass and star formation rate.
The predictions for the HOD are remarkably similar for samples ranked by
stellar mass. The predicted bias averaged over 5-25 Mpc/h is consistent between
models to within 10%. At small pair separations there is a difference in the
predicted clustering. This arises because the Durham models allow some
satellite galaxies to merge with the central galaxy in a halo when they are
still associated with resolved subhaloes. The agreement between the models is
less good for samples defined by cold gas mass or star formation rate, with the
small scale clustering differing by an order of magnitude, reflecting the
uncertainty in the modelling of star formation. The model predictions in these
cases are qualitatively similar, with a markedly shallower slope for the
correlation function than is found for stellar mass selected samples and with
the HOD displaying an asymmetric peak for central galaxies. We provide
illustrative parametric fits to the HODs predicted by the models. Our results
reveal the current limitations on how well we can predict galaxy bias in a

on the physics of galaxy formation from galaxy clustering measurements and the

galaxy lobes. This implies a significant difference in the radiative efficiency
of the two morphological classes. To test this hypothesis, we have measured the
kinetic energy flux for a sample of 3C FRII radio sources using a new method
based on the observed parameters of the jet terminal hotspots, and compared the
resulting Q(jet) - L(radio) relation to that obtained for FRI radio galaxies
based on X-ray cavity measurements. Contrary to expectations, we find
approximate agreement between the Q(jet) - L(radio) relations determined
separately for FRI and FRII radio galaxies. This result is ostensibly difficult
to reconcile with the emerging scenario in which the lobes of FRI and FRII
radio galaxies have vastly different energy budgets. However, a combination of
lower density environment, spectral ageing and strong shocks driven by powerful
FRII radio galaxies may reduce the radiative efficiency of these objects
relative to FRIs and couteract, to some extent, the higher radiative efficiency
expected to arise due to the lower fraction of energy in non-radiating

detected from the cluster core area with the highest stellar density and from a
dusty ridge surrounding the HII region. We use a census of massive stars in the

provide a significant contribution to the X-ray emission detected from the
central area of the cluster. We therefore suggest that X-ray emission at the
cluster core originates from an ensemble of low- and solar-mass
pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars, each of which would be too weak in X-rays to be
detected individually. We attribute the X-ray emission from the dusty ridge to
the embedded tight cluster of the new-born stars known in this area from
infrared studies. Assuming that the levels of X-ray activity in young stars in
the low-metallicity environment of NGC 602a are comparable to their Galactic
counterparts, then the detected spatial distribution, spectral properties, and
level of X-ray emission are largely consistent with those expected from low-
and solar-mass PMS stars and young stellar objects (YSOs). This is the first
discovery of X-ray emission attributable to PMS stars and YSOs in the SMC,
which suggests that the accretion and dynamo processes in young, low-mass
objects in the SMC resemble those in the Galaxy.

the in-plane absorption spectrum exhibits a unique frequency dependence that
can be described by a power-law with an exponent of approximately 1.4, in sharp

The absorption is also found to increase as the temperature decreases, a
behavior unexpected for conventional insulators. Such features are consistent

transport properties are determined by the available microscopic states above
its lowest energy level. These slightly higher quantum states are described by
elementary excitations and dictate the response of the system under external
stimuli. The spectrum of these excitations, obtained typically from inelastic
neutron and x-ray scattering, is the spatial and temporal Fourier transform of
the density-density correlation function of the system, which dictates how a
perturbation propagates in space and time. As frequency-domain measurements do
not generally contain phase information, time-domain measurements of these
fluctuations could yield a more direct method for investigating the excitations
of solids and their interactions both in equilibrium and far-from equilibrium.
Here we show that the diffuse scattering of femtosecond x-ray pulses produced
by a free electron laser (FEL) can directly measure these density-density
correlations due to lattice vibrations in the time domain. We obtain
spectroscopic information of the lattice excitations with unprecedented
momentum- and frequency- resolution, without resolving the energy of the
outgoing photon. Correlations are created via an acoustic analog of the
dynamical Casimir effect, where a femtosecond laser pulse slightly quenches the
phonon frequencies, producing pairs of squeezed phonons at momenta +q and -q.
These pairs of phonons manifest as macroscopic, time-dependent coherences in
the displacement correlations that are then probed directly by x-ray
scattering. Since the time-dependent correlations are preferentially created in
regions of strong electron-phonon coupling, the time-resolved approach is
natural as a spectroscopic tool of low energy collective excitations in solids,
and their microscopic interactions, both in linear response and beyond.

the detection of six clusters in a single field, making XMM-Newton an

demonstrate that in MDM and CDM models fitted equally well to a galactic

speeds from the disc. The recent radial velocity (RAVE) survey of the Milky Way
has pinned down the escape speed from the solar neighbourhood to
$v_{esc}=544^{+64}_{-46}$ km s$^{-1}$, placing an additional constraint on dark
matter models. We have constructed an MDM model for the Milky Way based on its
rotational curve, and find an escape speed that is just consistent with the
observed value given the current errors, which lends credence to the viability
of the MDM model. The Gaia-ESO spectroscopic survey is expected to lead to an
even more precise estimate of the escape speed that will further constrain dark
matter models. However, the largest differences in stellar escape speeds
between both models are predicted for dark matter dominated dwarf galaxies such
as DDO 154, and kinematical studies of such galaxies could prove key in
establishing, or abolishing, the validity of the MDM model.

sequenced genomes. A fundamental question is how to efficiently extract genomic
and epigenomic variants of clinical utility which will provide information for
optimal wellness and interference strategies. Traditional paradigm for
identifying variants of clinical validity is to test association of the
variants. However, significantly associated genetic variants may or may not be
usefulness for diagnosis and prognosis of diseases. Alternative to association
studies for finding genetic variants of predictive utility is to systematically
search variants that contain sufficient information for phenotype prediction.
To achieve this, we introduce concepts of sufficient dimension reduction and
coordinate hypothesis which project the original high dimensional data to very
low dimensional space while preserving all information on response phenotypes.
We then formulate clinically significant genetic variant discovery problem into
sparse SDR problem and develop algorithms that can select significant genetic
variants from up to or even ten millions of predictors with the aid of dividing
SDR for whole genome into a number of subSDR problems defined for genomic
regions. The sparse SDR is in turn formulated as sparse optimal scoring
problem, but with penalty which can remove row vectors from the basis matrix.
To speed up computation, we develop the modified alternating direction method
for multipliers to solve the sparse optimal scoring problem which can easily be
implemented in parallel. To illustrate its application, the proposed method is
applied to simulation data and the NHLBI's Exome Sequencing Project dataset

possible to directly test representational learning algorithms directly against
the representations contained in neural systems. Here, we propose a new
benchmark for visual representations on which we have directly tested the
neural representation in multiple visual cortical areas in macaque (utilizing
data from [Majaj et al., 2012]), and on which any computer vision algorithm
that produces a feature space can be tested. The benchmark measures the
effectiveness of the neural or machine representation by computing the
classification loss on the ordered eigendecomposition of a kernel matrix
[Montavon et al., 2011]. In our analysis we find that the neural representation
in visual area IT is superior to visual area V4. In our analysis of
representational learning algorithms, we find that three-layer models approach
the representational performance of V4 and the algorithm in [Le et al., 2012]
surpasses the performance of V4. Impressively, we find that a recent supervised
algorithm [Krizhevsky et al., 2012] achieves performance comparable to that of
IT for an intermediate level of image variation difficulty, and surpasses IT at
a higher difficulty level. We believe this result represents a major milestone:
it is the first learning algorithm we have found that exceeds our current

differential equations. By establishing a functional limit theorem, we show
that DSRs may be considered to be (strongly) time-consistent continuous-time
extensions of iterated spectral risk-measures, which are obtained by iterating
a given spectral risk-measure (such as Expected Shortfall) along a given
time-grid. Specifically, we demonstrate that any DSR arises in the limit of a
sequence of such iterated spectral risk-measures driven by lattice-random
walks, under suitable scaling and vanishing time- and spatial-mesh sizes. To
illustrate its use in financial optimisation problems, we analyse a dynamic
portfolio optimisation problem under a DSR.

gluon fragmentation into a J/psi at relative order v^4, making use of the
nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) factorization approach. The corresponding full-QCD
process exhibits infrared divergences that manifest themselves as single and
double poles in epsilon in 4-2epsilon dimensions. We isolate the
infrared-divergent contributions and treat them analytically. In the matching
of full QCD to NRQCD, the pole contributions are absorbed into long-distance
NRQCD matrix elements. The renormalizations of the ultraviolet divergences of
the long-distance NRQCD matrix elements involve Born and one-loop single-pole
counterterm contributions and Born double-pole counterterm contributions. While
the order-v^4 contribution enhances the J/psi hadroproduction rate for the
color-singlet channel substantially, this contribution is not important
numerically in comparison with the color-octet contributions. We also find that
the ^3P_J color-octet channel in the gluon fragmentation function contributes
to J/psi hadroproduction significantly in comparison with the complete
contribution of next-to-leading order in alpha_s in that channel.

states that the magnetic flux---the integral of magnetic field penetrating a

motions. Pedagogues of MHD commonly derive flux freezing without showing how to
take the material derivative of a general flux integral and/or assuming a
vanishing field divergence from the outset. Here I avoid these shortcomings and
derive flux freezing by direct differentiation, explicitly using a Jacobian to
transform between the evolving field-penetrating surface at different times.
The approach is instructive for its generality and helps elucidate the role of
magnetic monopoles in breaking flux freezing. The paucity of appearances of
this derivation in standard MHD texts suggests that its pedagogic value is
underappreciated.

either be interpreted as a single generative model trained to maximize a
variational approximation to the generalized pseudolikelihood, or as a family

orientation of nanomagnets without applying external magnetic fields. They find
direct application in non-volatile data storage and logic devices, and provide
insight into fundamental processes related to the interdependence between
charge and spin transport. Recent demonstrations of magnetization switching
induced by in-plane current injection in ferromagnetic heterostructures have
drawn attention to a class of spin torques based on orbital-to-spin momentum
transfer, which is alternative to pure spin transfer torque (STT) between
noncollinear magnetic layers and amenable to more diversified device functions.
Due to the limited number of studies, however, there is still no consensus on
the symmetry, magnitude, and origin of spin-orbit torques (SOTs). Here we
report on the quantitative vector measurement of SOTs in Pt/Co/AlO trilayers
using harmonic analysis of the anomalous and planar Hall effects as a function
of the applied current and magnetization direction. We provide an all-purpose
scheme to measure the amplitude and direction of SOTs for any arbitrary
orientation of the magnetization, including corrections due to the interplay of
Hall and thermoelectric effects. Based on general space and time inversion
symmetry arguments, we show that asymmetric heterostructures allow for two
different SOTs having odd and even behavior with respect to magnetization
reversal. Our results reveal a scenario that goes beyond established models of
the Rashba and spin Hall contributions to SOTs. The even SOT is STT-like but
stronger than expected from the spin Hall effect in Pt. The odd SOT is composed
of a constant field-like term and an additional component, which is strongly
anisotropic and does not correspond to a simple Rashba field.

Hydrodynamic interactions are implemented by a Stokesian viscous coupling
between the network nodes and a uniformly deforming liquid. Our simulations
show that in a critical connectivity regime, these systems display weak power
law rheology in which the complex shear modulus scales with frequency as G^* ~
(i * omega)^Delta where Delta = 0.41, in discord with a mean field prediction
of Delta = 1/2. The weak power law rheology in the critical regime can be
understood from a simple scaling relation between the macroscopic rheology and
the nonaffine strain fluctuations, which diverge with vanishing frequency for
isostatic networks. We expand on a dynamic effective medium theory, showing
that it quantitatively describes the rheology of a diluted triangular lattice
far from isostaticity; although the EMT correctly predicts the scaling form for
the rheology of near-isostatic networks, there remains a quantitative disparity
due to the mean-field nature of the EMT. Surprisingly, by connecting this
critical scaling of the rheology with that of the strain fluctuations, we find
that the dynamical behavior of disordered spring networks is fully determined
by the critical exponents that govern the behavior of elastic network in the
absence of viscous interactions.

Real-Time Transient Survey gathered between 2006 February and 2012 May indicate
that the object exhibits no variability. However, a high-resolution (R ~
50,000) optical spectrum of this object obtained with the 8.2m Subaru telescope
using High Dispersion Spectrograph on the 2012 January 13 offers sufficient
spectral evidences for the object being a cool HdC star of RCB type undergoing
light decline. In contrast to the Na I D broad absorption features, seen in the
low-resolution spectra on several occasions, the high-resolution spectrum
exhibits Na I D2 and D1 features in emission. A few emission lines due to Mg I,
Sc II, Ti I, Ti II, Fe II and Ba I are also observed in the spectrum of this
object for the first time. Such emission features combined with neutral and
singly ionized lines of Ca, Ti, Fe, etc., in absorption are reportedly seen in
RCBs spectra in the early stage of decline or during the recovery to maximum.
Further, the light decline of RCBs is ascribed to the formation of a cloud of
soot that obscures the visible photosphere. Presence of such circumstellar
material is evident from the polarimetric observations with an estimated V-band
percentage polarization of ~1.7% for this object.

error contribution in the covariance matrix. We numerically derive the
covariance matrix as well as the cosmology dependence of the spectra from a
large set of N-body simulations performed for various cosmologies and carry out
Fisher matrix forecasts for tomographic weak lensing surveys with three source
redshifts. After showing the consistency of the power and bispectra measured

the covariance matrix assuming a typical ongoing survey across 1500 deg^2 with
the mean source number density of 30 arcmin^{-2} at the mean redshift z_s=1.0.
Although the shape noise contributes a significant fraction to the total error
budget and it mitigates the impact of the non-Gaussian error for this source
number density, we find that the non-Gaussian error degrades the cumulative
signal-to-noise ratio up to the maximum multipole of 2000 by a factor of about
2 (3) in the power (bi-) spectrum analysis. Its impact on the final
cosmological parameter forecast with 6 parameters can be as large as 15% in the
size of the one-dimensional statistical error. This can be a problem in future
wide and deep weak lensing surveys for precision cosmology. We also show how
much the dark energy figure of merit is affected by the non-Gaussian error
contribution and demonstrate an optimal survey design with a fixed
observational time.

reorienting themselves in the direction of the field. Since the dielectric
anisotropy of a nematic is small, it takes relatively large fields to elicit a
significant liquid crystal response. The interaction may be enhanced in
colloidal suspensions of ferromagnetic particles in a liquid crystalline
matrix---ferronematics--- as proposed by Brochard and de Gennes in 1970. The
ability of these particles to align with the field and, simultaneously, cause
reorientation of the nematic molecules, greatly increases the magnetic response
of the mixture. Essentially the particles provide an easy axis of magnetization
that interacts with the liquid crystal via surface anchoring.
  We derive an expression for the effective energy of ferronematic in the
dilute limit, that is, when the number of particles tends to infinity while
their total volume fraction tends to zero. The total energy of the mixture is
assumed to be the sum of the bulk elastic liquid crystal contribution, the
anchoring energy of the liquid crystal on the surfaces of the particles, and
the magnetic energy of interaction between the particles and the applied
magnetic field. The homogenized limiting ferronematic energy is obtained
rigorously using a variational approach. It generalizes formal expressions
previously reported in a physical literature.

rate-function delay optimality (in the many-channel many-user asymptotic

respectively. The sufficient conditions allow us to prove rate-function delay
optimality for a class of Oldest Packets First (OPF) policies and throughput
optimality for a large class of Maximum Weight in the Fluid limit (MWF)
policies, respectively. By exploiting the special features of our carefully
chosen sufficient conditions and intelligently combining policies from the
classes of OPF and MWF policies, we design hybrid policies that are both
rate-function delay-optimal and throughput-optimal with a complexity of
$O(n^{2.5} \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of channels or users. Our
sufficient condition is also used to show that a previously proposed policy
called Delay Weighted Matching (DWM) is rate-function delay-optimal. However,
DWM incurs a high complexity of $O(n^5)$. Thus, our approach yields
significantly lower complexity than the only previously designed delay and
throughput optimal scheduling policy. We also conduct numerical experiments to
validate our theoretical results.

traditionally conducted assuming equal communication ranges for the data and

actually function of the packet length. Control packets are typically much
shorter than data packets. As a consequence, a substantial discrepancy exists
in practice between their respective communication ranges. In this paper, we
devise a practical link model for computing the effective communication range.
We further introduce two simple strategies for bridging the gap between the
control and data packet communication ranges. Our primary objective in this
paper is to construct a realistic analytical framework describing the
end-to-end performance of beaconless geo-routing protocols. Two flagship
protocols are selected in this paper for further investigation under the
developed framework. For a better perspective, the two protocols are actually
compared to a hypothetical limit case; one which offers optimal energy and
latency performance. Finally, we present four different application scenarios.
For each scenario, we highlight the geo-routing protocol which performs the
best and discuss the reasons behind it.

effect from the epoch of reionization (EOR). We use detailed N-body+radiative
transfer simulations to follow inhomogeneous reionization of the intergalactic
medium (IGM). For the first time we take into account the ""self-regulation"" of
reionization: star formation in low-mass dwarf galaxies (10^8 M_\sun \lesssim M
\lesssim 10^9 M_\sun) or minihalos (10^5 M_\sun \lesssim M \lesssim 10^8
M_\sun) is suppressed if these halos form in the regions that were already
ionized or Lyman-Werner dissociated. Some previous work suggested that the
amplitude of the kSZ power spectrum from the EOR can be described by a
two-parameter family: the epoch of half ionization and the duration of
reionization. However, we argue that this picture applies only to simple forms
of the reionization history which are roughly symmetric about the
half-ionization epoch. In self-regulated reionization, the universe begins to
be ionized early, maintains a low level of ionization for an extended period,
and then finishes reionization as soon as high-mass atomically-cooling halos
dominate. While inclusion of self-regulation affects the amplitude of the kSZ
power spectrum only modestly (\sim 10 %), it can change the duration of
reionization by a factor of more than two. We conclude that the simple
two-parameter family does not capture the effect of a physical, yet complex,
reionization history caused by self-regulation. When added to the
post-reionization kSZ contribution, our prediction for the total kSZ power
spectrum is below the current upper bound from the South Pole Telescope.
Therefore, the current upper bound on the kSZ effect from the EOR is consistent
with our understanding of the physics of reionization.

by replacing intensities through quantum mechanical average values of relevant
number operators and is viewed as first generalization of Intensity. This
definition assigns inaccurately the unpolarized status to some typical optical
fields such as amplitude coherent phase randomized and hidden polarized, which
are not truly unpolarized light. The apparent paradoxical trait is circumvented
by proposing a new definition of degree of polarization in Quantum Optics
through second generalization of Intensity. The correspondence of new degree of
polarization to usual degree of polarization in Quantum Optics is established.
It is seen that the two definitions disagree significantly for intense optical
fields but coincides for weak light (thermal light) or for optical fields in
which occupancy of photons in orthogonal mode is very feeble. Our proposed
definition of degree of polarization, similar to other proposals in literature,
reveals an interesting feature that states of polarization of optical quantum
fields depend upon the average photons (intensity) present therein.

typically under sample the space of possible states. We study a generic
framework where a complex system is seen as a system of many interacting
degrees of freedom, which are known only in part, that optimize a given
function. We show that the underlying distribution with respect to the known
variables has the Boltzmann form, with a temperature that depends on the number
of unknown variables. In particular, when the unknown part of the objective
function decays faster than exponential, the temperature decreases as the
number of variables increases. We show in the representative case of the
Gaussian distribution, that models are predictable only when the number of
relevant variables is less than a critical threshold. As a further consequence,
we show that the information that a sample contains on the behavior of the
system is quantified by the entropy of the frequency with which different
states occur. This allows us to characterize the properties of maximally
informative samples: in the under-sampling regime, the most informative
frequency size distributions have power law behavior and Zipf's law emerges at
the crossover between the under sampled regime and the regime where the sample
contains enough statistics to make inference on the behavior of the system.
These ideas are illustrated in some applications, showing that they can be used
to identify relevant variables or to select most informative representations of

equation, which is based on quantum stochastic calculus, and we show how to
transform it into the classical stochastic Schr\""odinger equation by
diagonalization of suitable quantum observables, based on the isomorphism
between Fock space and Wiener space. Then, we give the a posteriori state, the

link its evolution to the classical stochastic Schr\""odinger equation. Finally,

process with probability distribution given by the rules of quantum mechanics.
When the output process is stationary, at least in the long run, the spectrum
of the process can be introduced and its properties studied. In particular we
show how the Heisenberg uncertainty relations give rise to characteristic
bounds on the possible spectra and we discuss how this is related to the
typical quantum phenomenon of squeezing. We use a simple quantum system, a
two-level atom stimulated by a laser, to discuss the differences between
homodyne and heterodyne detection and to explicitly show squeezing and
anti-squeezing and the Mollow triplet in the fluorescence spectrum.

hyperbolic and we obtain a time line with a spatial topology change from the

invariant. Among the infinite possible smoothness structures of this spacetime,
we choose a homology 3-sphere constructed from the knot 8_{10} with hyperbolic
geometry, i.e. admitting a homogenous metric of negative scalar curvature. We
discuss the accelerated expansion for FLRW cosmology caused by the topology
change. In contrast to other inflation models, this process stops after a
finite time. Alternatively, the topology change can be also described by a
SU(2)-valued scalar field. Then we calculate the expansion rate (having more
than 60 e-folds) and the energy time scale. The coupling to matter is also
interpreted geometrically and the reheating process (as well the supercooled
expansion during inflation) is naturally obtained. The model depends only on a
single parameter, a topological invariant of the homology 3-sphere, and assumes
a Planck size universe of S^3-topology. The dependence of the model on the
initial state and the a geometric interpretation of quantum fluctuations are
also discussed.

have a significant impact on the growth process of planetesimals. Yet, the
conditions that result in bouncing are not very well understood. Existing
simulations studying the bouncing behavior used aggregates with an artificial,
very regular internal structure.
  Aims: Here, we study the bouncing behavior of sub-mm dust aggregates that are
constructed applying different sample preparation methods. We analyze how the
internal structure of the aggregate alters the collisional outcome and
determine the influence of aggregate size, porosity, collision velocity, and
impact parameter.
  Methods: We use molecular dynamics simulations where the individual
aggregates are treated as spheres that are made up of several hundred thousand
individual monomers. The simulations are run on GPUs.
  Results: Statistical bulk properties and thus bouncing behavior of sub-mm
dust aggregates depend heavily on the preparation method. In particular, there
is no unique relation between the average volume filling factor and the
coordination number of the aggregate. Realistic aggregates bounce only if their
volume filling factor exceeds 0.5 and collision velocities are below 0.1 m/s.
  Conclusions: For dust particles in the protoplanetary nebula we suggest that
the bouncing barrier may not be such a strong handicap in the growth phase of
dust agglomerates, at least in the size range of 0.1 mm.

obtained with and without CEP-stabilization: with 8-cycle (22 fs) pulses,
Xe$^{6+}$ yields are suppressed (relative to Xe$^+$ yields) by between 30% and
50%, depending on phase, reflecting the phase dependence of non-sequential
ionization and its contribution to the formation of higher charge states. On
the other hand, ion yields for Xe$^{q+}$ ($q$=2-4) with CEP-stablized pulses
are enhanced (by up to 50%) compared to those with CEP-unstabilized pulses.
Such enhancment is particulary pronounced with 2-cycle (5 fs) pulses and is
distinctly phase-dependent. Orbital shape and symmetry are found to have a
bearing on the response of CS$_2$ to variations in optical field that are
effected as CE phase is controllably altered, keeping the overall intensity
constant. Molecular fragmentation is found to depend on field strength (not
intensity); the observed relative enhancement of fragmentation when
CEP-stabilized 2-cycle pulses are used is found to be at the expense of
molecular ionization.

solutions to the MB equations and their classification was done in [6] by
Gabitov, Zakharov and Mikhailov. In particular, they gave an approximate
solution of the mixed problem to the MB equations in the domain
$x,t\in(0,L)\times (0,\infty)$ and, on this bases, a description of the

developed the IST method in the form of the Marchenko integral equations. We

the quarter plane. We use matrix Riemann-Hilbert (RH) problems and simultaneous
spectral analysis of the both Lax operators. First, we introduce appropriate
compatible solutions of the corresponding Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur (AKNS)
equations and then we suggest such a matrix RH problem which corresponds to the
mixed problem for MB equations. Second, we generalize this matrix RH problem,
prove a unique solvability of the new RH problem and show that the RH problem
(after a specialization of jump matrix) generates the MB equations. As a result
we obtain solutions defined on the whole line and studied in [5] and [6],
solutions to the mixed problem studied below in this paper and solutions with a
periodic (finite-gap) boundary conditions. The kind of solution is defined by
the specialization of conjugation contour and jump matrix.

Y$ there is a bounded linear operator $T:L(f)\equiv\overline{{\rm

stable for every $Y (X)$. In this paper, we show that if a dual Banach space
$X$ is universally-left-stable, then it is isometric to a complemented
$w^*$-closed subspace of $\ell_\infty(\Gamma)$ for some set $\Gamma$, hence, an
injective space; and that a Banach space is universally-left-stable if and only
if it is a cardinality injective space; and universally-left-stability spaces
are invariant.

proposed with insufficient security criteria, they turn out to still be secure

\""uber Bewegungsintegrale und ihre Anwendungen in Bahntheorien"", Verlag der
Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, volume 212, 2005.] to iteratively
remove oscillatory terms in the equations of motion for different masses that
were not present in the case of equal masses. Our smallness parameter is chosen
to be the difference of the symmetric mass ratio to the value 1/4. Before the
first Lie transformation, the set of conserved quantities consists of the total
angular momentum, the amplitudes of the orbital angular momentum and of the
spins, $L, S_1,$ and $S_2$. In contrary, the magnitude of the total spin
$S=|S_1+S_2|$ is not conserved and we wish to shift its non-conservation to
higher orders of the smallness parameter.
  We perform the iterations explicitly to first order, while performing higher
orders would mean no structural difference or harder mathematical difficulties.
To apply this method, we develop a canonical system of spin variables reduced
by the conservation law of total angular momentum, which is imposed on the
phase space as a constraint. The result is an asymptotic series in $\epsilon$
that may be truncated appropriately considering the physical properties of the
regarded system.

plasma originating in the pulsar magnetopshere. In the simplest case of a
stationary axisymmetric force-free magnetosphere, a self-consistent description
of the fields and currents is given by the well-known pulsar equation. Here we
revise the commonly used boundary conditions of the problem in order to
incorporate the plasma-producing gaps and to provide a framework for a truly
self-consistent treatment of the pulsar magnetosphere. The generalized
multipolar solution of the pulsar equation is found, which, as compared to the
customary split monopole solution, is suggested to better represent the
character of the dipolar force-free field at large distances. In particular,
the outer gap location entirely inside the light cylinder implies that beyond
the light cylinder the null and critical lines should be aligned and go
parallel to the equator at a certain altitude. Our scheme of the pulsar
force-free magnetosphere, which will hopefully be followed by extensive
analytic and numerical studies, may have numerous implications for different

spectrum on scales of order 100-150 h^{-1} Mpc that promise to be a powerful
tool to constrain and test cosmological models. The BAO have attracted such
attention that future upcoming surveys have been designed with the BAO at the
forefront of the primary science goals. Recent studies have advocated the use
of a spherical-Fourier Bessel (sFB) expansion for future wide field surveys
that cover both wide and deep regions of the sky necessitating the simultaneous
treatment of the spherical sky geometry as well as the extended radial
coverage. Ignoring the possible effects of growth, which is not expected to be
significant at low redshifts, we present an extended analysis of the BAOs using
the sFB formalism by taking into account the role of non-linearities and linear
redshift distortions in the oscillations observed in the galaxy power spectrum.
The sFB power spectrum has both radial and tangential dependence and it has
been shown that in the limit that we approach a deep survey the sFB power
spectrum is purely radial and collapses to the Cartesian Fourier power
spectrum. This radialisation of information is shown to hold even in the
presence of redshift space distortions (RSD) and 1-loop corrections to the
galaxy power spectrum albeit with modified tangential and radial dependence. As
per previous studies we find that the introduction of non-linearities leads to
a damping of the oscillations in the matter power spectrum.

experiment that was carried out at Cerro Tololo to monitor the abundance and
altitude of the mesospheric sodium in 2001, during six runs covering a period
of one year. This data is used to derive the mesospheric sodium column density,
the sodium layer thickness and the temporal behavior of the sodium layer mean
altitude. The second set of data was gathered during the first year of the
Gemini MCAO System (GeMS) commissioning and operations. GeMS uses five LGS to
measure and compensate for atmospheric distortions. Analysis of the LGS
wavefront sensor data provides information about the sodium photon return and
the spot elongation seen by the WFS. All these parameters show large variations
on a yearly, nightly and hourly basis, affecting the LGS brightness, shape and
mean altitude. The sodium photon return varies by a factor of three to four
over a year, and can change by a factor of two over a night. In addition, the
comparison of the photon returns obtained in 2001 with those measured a decade
later using GeMS shows a significant difference in laser format efficiencies.
We find that the temporal power spectrum of the sodium mean altitude follows a
linear trend, in good agreement with the results reported by Pfrommer & Hickson
(2010).

statistical mechanics of non-ergodic and complex systems. In particular it was
shown that in the theory of binary processes with correlations, the q-Gaussian
can appear as a limiting distribution. Further, there exist several problems
and situations where, depending on procedural or algorithmic details of
data-processing, q-Gaussian distributions may yield distinct values of q, where
one value is larger, the other smaller than one. To relate such pairs of
q-Gaussians it would be convenient to map such distributions onto one another,
ideally in a way, that any value of q can be mapped uniquely to any other value
q'. So far a (duality) map from q -> q'=(7-5q)/(5-3q) was found, mapping q from
the interval q\in [-\infty, 1] -> q'\in [1, 5/3]. Here we complete the theory
of transformations of q-Gaussians by deriving a general map \gamma_{qq'}, that
transforms normalizable q-Gaussian distributions onto one another for which q
and q' are in the range of [1,3). By combining this with the previous result, a
mapping from any value of q \in [-\infty,3) is possible to any other value
q'\in [-\infty,3). We show that the action of \gamma_{qq'} on the set of
q-Gaussian distributions is a transformation groupoid.

shifts in stellar spectra requires accounting for a number of second-order
effects. For most stars, gravitational redshifts, convective blueshifts, and
transverse stellar motion are the dominant contributors. We provide theoretical
corrections for the net velocity shifts due to convection expected for the
measurements from the Gaia Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS). We used a set of
three-dimensional time-dependent simulations of stellar surface convection
computed with CO5BOLD to calculate spectra of late-type stars in the Gaia RVS
range and to infer the net velocity offset that convective motions will induce
in radial velocities derived by cross-correlation. The net velocity shifts
derived by cross-correlation depend both on the wavelength range and spectral
resolution of the observations. Convective shifts for Gaia RVS observations are
less than 0.1 km/s for late-K-type stars, and they increase with stellar mass,
reaching about 0.3 km/s or more for early F-type dwarfs. This tendency is the
result of an increase with effective temperature in both temperature and
velocity fluctuations in the line-forming region. Our simulations also indicate
that the net RVS convective shifts can be positive (i.e. redshifts) in some
cases. Overall, the blueshifts weaken slightly with increasing surface gravity,
and are enhanced at low metallicity. Gravitational redshifts amount up to 0.7
km/s and dominate convective blueshifts for dwarfs, but become much weaker for
giants.

application-oriented setup. So far, the problem of MIMO channel estimation has
mostly been treated within the context of minimizing the mean square error
(MSE) of the channel estimate subject to various constraints, such as an upper
bound on the available training energy. We introduce a more general framework
for the task of training sequence design in MIMO systems, which can treat not
only the minimization of channel estimator's MSE, but also the optimization of
a final performance metric of interest related to the use of the channel
estimate in the communication system. First, we show that the proposed
framework can be used to minimize the training energy budget subject to a
quality constraint on the MSE of the channel estimator. A deterministic version
of the ""dual"" problem is also provided. We then focus on four specific
applications, where the training sequence can be optimized with respect to the
classical channel estimation MSE, a weighted channel estimation MSE and the MSE
of the equalization error due to the use of an equalizer at the receiver or an
appropriate linear precoder at the transmitter. In this way, the intended use
of the channel estimate is explicitly accounted for. The superiority of the
proposed designs over existing methods is demonstrated via numerical

contribution of the divergent fermionic vacuum fluctuation at one loop level
makes these models effective QCD-like models. It has been explicitly shown that
analytical expressions for the model parameters, meson masses, and mixing
angles do not depend on any arbitrary renormalization scale. We have
investigated how the incorporation of fermionic vacuum fluctuation in quark

in the masses of the chiral partners in pseudoscalar ($\pi$, $\eta$, $\eta'$,
$K$) and scalar ($\sigma$, $a_0$, $f_0$, $\kappa$) meson nonets as the
temperature is varied on the reduced temperature scale. Comparison of present
results in the quark meson model with vacuum term and PQM model with vacuum
term with the already existing calculations in the bare 2+1 quark meson and PQM
models, shows that the restoration of chiral symmetry becomes smoother due to
the influence of the fermionic vacuum term. We find that the melting of the
strange condensate registers a significant increase in the presence of the
fermionic vacuum term and its highest melting is found in the PQM model with
vacuum term. The role of the $U_A(1)$ anomaly in determining the isoscalar
masses and mixing angles for the pseudoscalar ($\eta$ and $\eta'$) and scalar

independence-based algorithms. These algorithms proceed by performing
statistical independence tests on data, trusting completely the outcome of each
test. In practice tests may be incorrect, resulting in potential cascading
errors and the consequent reduction in the quality of the structures learned.
IBMAP contemplates this uncertainty in the outcome of the tests through a
probabilistic maximum-a-posteriori approach. The approach is instantiated in
the IBMAP-HC algorithm, a structure selection strategy that performs a
polynomial heuristic local search in the space of possible structures. We
present an extensive empirical evaluation on synthetic and real data, showing
that our algorithm outperforms significantly the current independence-based
algorithms, in terms of data efficiency and quality of learned structures, with
equivalent computational complexities. We also show the performance of IBMAP-HC
in a real-world application of knowledge discovery: EDAs, which are
evolutionary algorithms that use structure learning on each generation for
modeling the distribution of populations. The experiments show that when
IBMAP-HC is used to learn the structure, EDAs improve the convergence to the

acceleration. The historical culprits for the acceleration of the bulk of
Galactic cosmic rays are supernova remnants: explosions on ~10000 year
time-scales. Increasingly however, time-variable emission points to rapid and
efficient particle acceleration in a range of different astrophysical systems.
Gamma-ray bursts have the shortest time-scales, with inferred bulk Lorentz
factors of ~1000 and photons emitted beyond 100 GeV, but active galaxies,
pulsar wind nebulae and colliding stellar winds are all now associated with
time-variable emission at ~TeV energies. Cosmic photons and neutrinos at these
energies offer a powerful probe of the underlying physical mechanisms of cosmic
explosions, and a tool for exploring fundamental physics with these systems.

of simulating a multi-qubit gate. Secondly, we completely characterize the
two-qubit gate cost of simulating a three-qubit controlled controlled gate by
generalizing our result on the cost of Toffoli gate. The function of controlled
controlled gate is simply a three-qubit controlled unitary gate and can be
intuitively explained as follows: the gate will output the states of the two
control qubit directly, and apply the given one-qubit unitary $u$ on the target
qubit only if both the states of the control are $\ket{1}$. Previously, it is
only known that five two-qubit gates is sufficient for implementing such a gate
[Sleator and Weinfurter, Phys. Rev. Lett. 74, 4087 (1995)]. Our result shows
that if the determinant of $u$ is 1, four two-qubit gates is achievable
optimal. Otherwise, five is optimal. Thirdly, we show that five two-qubit gates
are necessary and sufficient for implementing the Fredkin gate(the controlled
swap gate), which settles the open problem introduced in [Smolin and
DiVincenzo, Phys. Rev. A, 53, 2855 (1996)]. The Fredkin gate is one of the most
important quantum logic gates because it is universal alone for classical
reversible computation, and thus with little help, universal for quantum

Fredkin gate was already known, and numerical evidence of showing five is

traveling to the Pluto system where its arrival is scheduled for July 2015,
should be able to reach an accuracy of 10 m (range) and 0.1 mm s^-1
(range-rate) over distances up to 50 au. This should allow to effectively
constrain the location of a putative trans-Plutonian massive object, dubbed
Planet X (PX) hereafter, whose existence has recently been postulated for a
variety of reasons connected with, e.g., the architecture of the Kuiper belt
and the cometary flux from the Oort cloud. Traditional scenarios involve a
rock-ice planetoid with mX = 0.7mE at some 100 - 200 au, or a Jovian body with
mX = 5mJ at about 10,000 - 20,000 au; as a result of our preliminary
sensitivity analysis, they should be detectable by New Horizons since they
would impact its range at a km level or so over a time span six years long.
Conversely, range residuals statistically compatible with zero having an
amplitude of 10 m would imply that PX, if it exists, could not be located at
less than about 4,500 au (mX = 0.7mE) or 60,000 au (mX = 5mJ), thus making a
direct detection quite demanding with the present-day technologies. As a
consequence, it would be appropriate to rename such a remote body as Telisto.
Also fundamental physics would benefit from this analysis since certain subtle
effects predicted by MOND for the deep Newtonian regions of our Solar System
are just equivalent to those of a distant pointlike mass.

  Despite its widespread success, the SVM suffers from some important

rather than generating predictive distributions. Recently Tipping (1999) has
formulated the Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), a probabilistic model whose

requires substantially fewer kernel functions.

functions. We argue that the a person's utility value for a given outcome can
be treated as we treat other domain attributes: as a random variable with a
density function over its possible values. We show that we can apply
statistical density estimation techniques to learn such a density function from
a database of partially elicited utility functions. In particular, we define a
Bayesian learning framework for this problem, assuming the distribution over
utilities is a mixture of Gaussians, where the mixture components represent
statistically coherent subpopulations. We can also extend our techniques to the
problem of discovering generalized additivity structure in the utility
functions in the population. We define a Bayesian model selection criterion for
utility function structure and a search procedure over structures. The
factorization of the utilities in the learned model, and the generalization
obtained from density estimation, allows us to provide robust estimates of
utilities using a significantly smaller number of utility elicitation
questions. We experiment with our technique on synthetic utility data and on a
real database of utility functions in the domain of prenatal diagnosis.

Ordering of low-dimensional distributions into a proper sequence fully defines
the resepctive computational procedure; therefore, a stury of different type of

they are consistent with the aether-related Lorentz-Poincare's interpretation
that allows absolute simultaneity. We thus strongly challenge the fundamental
status of Lorentz invariance and hence break the basic argument against de
Broglie-Bohm realistic quantum theory. We argue that both de Broglie-Bohm and
Lorentz-Poincare theories are capable of providing a real synthesis of quantum
and relativity theories. The synthesis is of such kind that quantum theory
appears the most fundamental physical theory for which relativity is only a
limiting case. In accordance with this hierarchy, quantum theory naturally
resolves the problem of aether in Lorentz-Poincare's relativity. The aether
could be a deeper Bohm-type undivided quantum pre-space, the relevance of which
directly follows from our observations.

particle in the search for the Standard Model Higgs boson at the LHC. We
revisit the theoretical inconsistency of the fundamental high-energy cutoff
with the parity-violating gauge symmetry of local quantum field theory for the
standard model. This inconsistency suggests high-dimensional operators of
fermion interactions, which are attributed to the quantum gravity. In this
letter, recalling the minimal dynamical symmetry-breaking mechanism, we show
that it is energetically favorable for the top quark to acquire its mass via
spontaneous symmetry breaking, whereas other fermions acquire their masses via
explicit symmetry breaking.

of great benefit in advancing the understanding of the global distribution of
mass, composition, and dynamical responses to geomagnetic forcing, and momentum
transfer via waves. The perceived risks associated with such low altitude and
short duration orbits has prohibited the launch of Discovery-class missions.
Miniaturization of instruments such as mass spectrometers and advances in the
nano-satellite technology, associated with relatively low cost of
nano-satellite manufacturing and operation, open an avenue for performing low
altitude missions. The time dependent coefficients of a second order
non-homogeneous ODE which describes the motion have a double periodic shape.
Hence, they will be approximated using Jacobi elliptic functions. Through a
change of variables the original ODE will be converted into Hill's ODE for
stability analysis using Floquet theory. We are interested in how changes in
the coefficients of the ODE affect the stability of the solution. The expected
result will be an allowable range of parameters for which the motion is
dynamically stable. A possible extension of the application is a computational
tool for the rapid evaluation of the stability of entry or re-entry vehicles in
rarefied flow regimes and of satellites flying in relatively low orbits.

pulsational characteristics of the Southern $\beta$ Cephei star ALS 3721.
Spectroscopic and multicolour photometric data were acquired at the South
African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO), South Africa in 2011. Frequency
analysis showed that the oscillations of ALS 3721 could be attributed to the
two main frequencies with higher significance. Stellar parameters and projected
rotational velocity obtained by the spectra were also used to perform
photometric mode identification. In order to determine spherical harmonic
degrees ($l$), a principal method was followed by comparing the observed light
amplitude ratios in different passbands with those computed from non--adiabatic
pulsation models. In general case, therefore, the spherical harmonic degrees
corresponding of the frequencies were found in the expected $\beta$ Cephei
range.

favor of feature extraction pipelines that rely on a coding step followed by a
linear classifier, due to their overall simplicity, well understood properties
of linear classifiers, and their computational efficiency. In this paper we
propose a novel view of this pipeline based on kernel methods and Nystrom
sampling. In particular, we focus on the coding of a data point with a local
representation based on a dictionary with fewer elements than the number of
data points, and view it as an approximation to the actual function that would
compute pair-wise similarity to all data points (often too many to compute in
practice), followed by a Nystrom sampling step to select a subset of all data
points.
  Furthermore, since bounds are known on the approximation power of Nystrom
sampling as a function of how many samples (i.e. dictionary size) we consider,
we can derive bounds on the approximation of the exact (but expensive to
compute) kernel matrix, and use it as a proxy to predict accuracy as a function
of the dictionary size, which has been observed to increase but also to
saturate as we increase its size. This model may help explaining the positive
effect of the codebook size and justifying the need to stack more layers (often
referred to as deep learning), as flat models empirically saturate as we add
more complexity.

computer vision recognition architectures. While highly effective methods exist
for patch-based dictionary learning, these methods may learn redundant features
after the pooling stage in a given early vision architecture. In this paper, we
offer a novel dictionary learning scheme to efficiently take into account the
invariance of learned features after the spatial pooling stage. The algorithm
is built on simple clustering, and thus enjoys efficiency and scalability. We
discuss the underlying mechanism that justifies the use of clustering
algorithms, and empirically show that the algorithm finds better dictionaries
than patch-based methods with the same dictionary size.

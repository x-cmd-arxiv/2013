filtering in a wide array of applications. Unfortunately, the approximation
error of particle filters typically grows exponentially in the dimension of the
underlying model. This phenomenon has rendered particle filters of limited use
in complex data assimilation problems. In this paper, we argue that it is often
possible, at least in principle, to develop local particle filtering algorithms
whose approximation error is dimension-free. The key to such developments is
the decay of correlations property, which is a spatial counterpart of the much
better understood stability property of nonlinear filters. For the simplest
possible algorithm of this type, our results provide under suitable assumptions
an approximation error bound that is uniform both in time and in the model
dimension. More broadly, our results provide a framework for the investigation
of filtering problems and algorithms in high dimension.

single-orifice diesel injector. Velocities of liquid structures were determined
from time-resolved ultrafast shadow images, formed by an amplified two-pulse
laser source coupled to a double-frame camera. A statistical analysis of the
data over many injection events was undertaken to map velocities related to
spray formation near the nozzle outlet as a function of time after start of
injection. These results reveal a strong asymmetry in the liquid profile of the
test injector, with distinct fast and slow regions on opposite sides of the
orifice. Differences of ~100 m/s can be observed between the 'fast' and 'slow'
sides of the jet, resulting in different atomization conditions across the
spray. On average, droplets are dispersed at a greater distance from the nozzle
on the 'fast' side of the flow, and distinct macrostructure can be observed
under the asymmetric velocity conditions. The changes in structural velocity
and atomization behavior resemble flow structures which are often observed in
the presence of string cavitation produced under controlled conditions in
scaled, transparent test nozzles. These observations suggest that widely used
common-rail supply configurations and modern injectors can potentially generate
asymmetric interior flows which strongly influence diesel spray morphology. The
velocimetry measurements presented in this work represent an effective and
relatively straightforward approach to identify deviant flow behavior in real
diesel sprays, providing new spatially resolved information on fluid structure
and flow characteristics within the shear layers on the jet periphery.

Although binary deletion channels have received significant attention over the
years, and many upper and lower bounds on their capacity have been derived,
such studies for the non-binary case are largely missing. The state of the art
is the following: as a trivial upper bound, capacity of an erasure channel with
the same input alphabet as the deletion channel can be used, and as a lower
bound the results by Diggavi and Grossglauser are available. In this paper, we
derive the first non-trivial non-binary deletion channel capacity upper bound
and reduce the gap with the existing achievable rates. To derive the results we
first prove an inequality between the capacity of a 2K-ary deletion channel
with deletion probability $d$, denoted by $C_{2K}(d)$, and the capacity of the
binary deletion channel with the same deletion probability, $C_2(d)$, that is,
$C_{2K}(d)\leq C_2(d)+(1-d)\log(K)$. Then by employing some existing upper
bounds on the capacity of the binary deletion channel, we obtain upper bounds
on the capacity of the 2K-ary deletion channel. We illustrate via examples the
use of the new bounds and discuss their asymptotic behavior as $d \rightarrow
0$.

downlink OFDMA aided by a decode-and-forward (DF) relay under a total power

proposed. Specifically, user message bits are transmitted in two time slots. A
subcarrier in the first slot can be paired with a subcarrier in the second slot
for the DF relay-aided transmission to a user. In particular, the source and
the relay can transmit simultaneously to implement beamforming at the
subcarrier in the second slot. Each unpaired subcarrier in either the first or
second slot is used for the source's direct transmission to a user. A benchmark
protocol, same as the proposed one except that the transmit beamforming is not
used for the relay-aided transmission, is also considered. For each protocol, a
polynomial-complexity algorithm is developed to find at least an approximately
optimum resource allocation (RA), by using continuous relaxation, the dual
method, and Hungarian algorithm. Instrumental to the algorithm design is an
elegant definition of optimization variables, motivated by the idea of
regarding the unpaired subcarriers as virtual subcarrier pairs in the direct
transmission mode. The effectiveness of the RA algorithm and the impact of
relay position and total power on the protocols' performance are illustrated by
numerical experiments. The proposed protocol always leads to a maximum WSR
equal to or greater than that for the benchmark one, and the performance gain
of using the proposed one is significant especially when the relay is in close
proximity to the source and the total power is low. Theoretical analysis is
presented to interpret these observations.

which can be modeled by the well-known Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts function with
a shape exponent {\beta} larger than one. This parameter is furthermore found
to be independent of both waiting time and wave-vector, leading to the
possibility to rescale all the correlation functions to a single master curve.
The dynamics in the glassy state is additionally characterized by different
aging regimes which persist in the deep glassy state. These features seem to be
universal in metallic glasses and suggest a non diffusive nature of the
dynamics. This universality is supported by the possibility of describing the
fast increase of the structural relaxation time with waiting time using a
unique model function, independently of the microscopic details of the system.

\cite{Abbon:2007pq}. One of the important objectives of the experiment is the
exploration of the transverse spin structure of the nucleon via spin dependent
azimuthal asymmetries in single-hadron production in deep inelastic scattering
of polarized leptons off transversely polarized target. For this purpose a
series of measurements were made in COMPASS, using 160 GeV/c longitudinally
polarized muon beam and transversely polarized $^6LiD$ (in 2002, 2003 and 2004)
and $NH_3$ (in 2007 and 2010) targets.
  Till now main attention was focused on Collins and Sivers asymmetries and
obtained results play an important role in the general understanding of the
three-dimensional nature of the nucleon in terms of Transverse Momentum

  In addition to these two measured leading-twist effects, the SIDIS
cross-section counts six more target transverse spin dependent azimuthal
effects, which have their own well defined leading or higher-twist
interpretation in terms of QCD parton model. So far COMPASS presented
preliminary results for these asymmetries from deuteron

ultra-luminous starburst galaxies at high redshift, discovered in the Herschel

2_{11}-2_{02} H_2O emission lines with integrated line fluxes ranging from 1.8
to 14 Jy.km/s. The corresponding apparent luminosities are mu x L_H2O ~ 3-12 x
10^8 Lo, where mu is the lensing magnification factor (3 < mu < 12). These
results confirm that H2O lines are among the strongest molecular lines in such
galaxies, with intensities almost comparable to those of the high-J CO lines,
and same profiles and line widths (200-900 km/s) as the latter. With the
current sensitivity of PdBI, H2O can therefore easily be detected in high-z
lensed galaxies (with F(500um) > 100 mJy) discovered in the Herschel surveys.
Correcting the luminosities for lensing amplification, L_H2O is found to have a
strong dependence on the IR luminosity, varying as ~L_IR^{1.2}. This relation
which needs to be confirmed with better statistics, may indicate a role of
radiative (IR) excitation of the H2O lines, and implies that high-z galaxies
with L_IR >~ 10^13 Lo tend to be very strong emitters in H2O, that have no

recent years due to its important role in constructing graph classifiers,
generating graph indices, etc. Most measurement of interestingness of
discriminative subgraph features are defined on certain graphs, where the
structure of graph objects are certain, and the binary edges within each graph
represent the ""presence"" of linkages among the nodes. In many real-world
applications, however, the linkage structure of the graphs is inherently
uncertain. Therefore, existing measurements of interestingness based upon
certain graphs are unable to capture the structural uncertainty in these
applications effectively. In this paper, we study the problem of discriminative
subgraph feature selection from uncertain graphs. This problem is challenging
and different from conventional subgraph mining problems because both the
structure of the graph objects and the discrimination score of each subgraph
feature are uncertain. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
discriminative subgraph feature selection method, DUG, which can find
discriminative subgraph features in uncertain graphs based upon different
statistical measures including expectation, median, mode and phi-probability.
We first compute the probability distribution of the discrimination scores for
each subgraph feature based on dynamic programming. Then a branch-and-bound
algorithm is proposed to search for discriminative subgraphs efficiently.
Extensive experiments on various neuroimaging applications (i.e., Alzheimer's
Disease, ADHD and HIV) have been performed to analyze the gain in performance
by taking into account structural uncertainties in identifying discriminative
subgraph features for graph classification.

thereby forming a bilayer Wigner crystal; five structures compete upon changing
the inter-wall separation. Here, we consider a dielectric jump between the
walls and a solvent in which charges are immersed, implying repulsive images.
Using recently developed series representations of lattice sums for Coulomb
law, we derive the complete phase diagram. In contrast to the homogeneous
dielectric case, the particles remain in a hexagonal Wigner monolayer up to a
certain distance between the walls. Beyond this distance, a bifurcation occurs
to a sequence of Wigner bilayers, each layer having a nonzero spacing from the

  Nearly-Linear Time",,,,,"cs.DS cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we present a simple combinatorial algorithm that solves
symmetric diagonally dominant (SDD) linear systems in nearly-linear time. It
uses very little of the machinery that previously appeared to be necessary for
a such an algorithm. It does not require recursive preconditioning, spectral
sparsification, or even the Chebyshev Method or Conjugate Gradient. After
constructing a ""nice"" spanning tree of a graph associated with the linear
system, the entire algorithm consists of the repeated application of a simple
(non-recursive) update rule, which it implements using a lightweight data
structure. The algorithm is numerically stable and can be implemented without
the increased bit-precision required by previous solvers. As such, the
algorithm has the fastest known running time under the standard unit-cost RAM
model. We hope that the simplicity of the algorithm and the insights yielded by
its analysis will be useful in both theory and practice.

collision centralities, the ranges in $p_t$, the pseudorapidity $\eta$, and the
azimuthal angle $\phi$. The square root of the measured $p_t$ correlations when

  In this paper we elaborate on the cases in which the discrete symmetry is a

imposed by the defect encode the general bosonic T- duality transformations for
toroidal compactifications. We generalize this analysis in some detail to the
case of topological defects allowed in coset CFTs, in particular to those
cosets where the gauged group is either an axial or vector U(1). This is
discussed in both the operator and Lagrangian approaches. We proceed to
construct a defect encoding a fermionic T-duality. We show that the fermionic
T-duality is implemented by the Super-Poincar\'{e} line bundle. The observation
that the exponent of the gauge invariant flux on a defect is a kernel of the

equivalent width (EW) in the central region indicates that Te rises as high as
13000 K. In contrast, the low EW's in the outer regions are largely due to
scattered diffuse Galactic radiation by dust. The images allowed determination
of unprecedented small scale variations in Te. These variations indicate that
the mean square area temperature fluctuations are significantly higher than
expected from simple photoionization. The power producing these fluctuations
occurs at scales of less than 3.5E15 cm. This scale length provides a strong
restriction on the mechanism causing the large t^2 values observed.

the objective of developing implementable (explicit) channel codes.
Specifically, low density parity check (LDPC) codes are adopted for use over
these channels, and their benefits are studied. Different scenarios on the
level of interference are considered. In particular, for strong interference
channel examples with binary phase shift keying (BPSK), it is demonstrated that
rates better than those offered by single user codes with time sharing are
achievable. Promising results are also observed with quadrature-shift-keying
(QPSK). Under general interference a Han-Kobayashi coding based scheme is
employed splitting the information into public and private parts, and utilizing
appropriate iterative decoders at the receivers. Using QPSK modulation at the
two transmitters, it is shown that rate points higher than those achievable by
time sharing are obtained.

  Wireless configuration objectives range from simply choosing the fastest way
to encode data on a single wireless link to the global optimization of many
interacting parameters over multiple sets of communicating devices. As more

and a saturation moment m_sat = 1.56 {\mu}_B/Mn, whereas T_C drops to zero for
a control sample prepared without Pb. For T_Si > 200 C, MnSi-B20 type
precipitates form with a T_C ~ 170 K. Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy
shows that the increase in the remanent magnetization in these two phases is
possibly correlated with an increase in the Mn substitutional fraction, which
suggests that a Si_{1-x}Mn_x dilute magnetic semiconductor may be forming in
the matrix between the precipitates. Density functional calculations show that
Pb changes the pathway by which the Mn atoms access the Si substitutional
sites, Mn_Si. While the Pb increases the formation energy of Mn_Si at the Si
surface, it enables substitutional incorporation by lowering the formation
energy of Si vacancies by 0.92 eV.

breaks the symmetries of $AdS_{5}$ to discrete scale invariance and also breaks
translation symmetry along the circle. The matter content of the 6D

we show that the linearized fluctuations around these 6D backgrounds are stable
i.e., the fluctuations do not violate the Breitenlohner-Freedman stability
criterion. The dual theories display periodic RG trajectories, but these RG
flows do not violate the $a$-theorem. In particular, the dual field theory is
not a soft deformation (deformation by marginal or relevant operators) of a 3+1
dimensional conformal field theory and hence the $a$-theorem and similar
monotonicity constraints on RG flows do not apply to these examples. The
holographic $c$-theorem also does not apply to these solutions. Finally, we

Principle to characterize extremal trajectories, i.e. candidate geodesics, for
a car-like robot with one trailer. We use time as the distance function. In
spite of partial progress, this problem has remained open in the past two
decades. Besides straight motion and turn with maximum allowed curvature, we
identify planar elastica as the third piece of motion that occurs along our
extr emals. We give a detailed characterization of such curves, a special case
of which, called \emph{merging curve}, connects maximum curvature turns to
straight line segments. The structure of extremals in our case is revealed
through analytical integration of the system and adjoint equations.

surface tension is considered. A systematic procedure for deriving an equation
for surface elevation for a prescribed relation between the orders of the two
expansion parameters, the amplitude parameter $\alpha$ and the long wavelength
(or shallowness) parameter $\beta$, is developed. Unlike the heuristic
approaches found in the literature, when modifications are made in the equation
for surface elevation itself, the procedure starts from the consistently
truncated asymptotic expansions for unidirectional waves, a counterpart of the
Boussinesq system of equations for the surface elevation and the bottom
velocity, from which the leading order and higher order equations for the
surface elevation can be obtained by iterations. The relations between the
orders of the two small parameters are taken in the form $\beta=O(\alpha^n)$
and $\alpha=O(\beta^m)$ with $n$ and $m$ specified to some important particular
cases. The analysis shows, in particular, that some evolution equations,
proposed before as model equations in other physical contexts (like the Gardner
equation, the modified KdV equation, and the so-called 5th-order KdV equation),
can emerge as the leading order equations in the asymptotic expansion for the
unidirectional water waves, on equal footing with the KdV equation. The results
related to the higher orders of approximation provide a set of consistent
higher order model equations for unidirectional water waves which replace the
KdV equation with higher-order corrections in the case of non-standard ordering
when the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are not of the same order of

Challenge (MDC), and the obtained results. We have used a Bayesian analysis in
the time domain, accelerated using the recently developed ABC-method which
consists of a form of lossy linear data compression. The TOAs were first
processed with Tempo2, where the design matrix was extracted for use in a
subsequent Bayesian analysis. We used different noise models to analyse the
datasets: no red noise, red noise the same for all pulsars, and individual red
noise per pulsar. We sampled from the likelihood with four different samplers:
""emcee"", ""t-walk"", ""Metropolis-Hastings"", and ""pyMultiNest"". All but emcee
agreed on the final result, with emcee failing due to artefacts of the
high-dimensionality of the problem. An interesting issue we ran into was that
the prior of all the 36 (red) noise amplitudes strongly affects the results. A
flat prior in the noise amplitude biases the inferred GWB amplitude, whereas a
flat prior in log-amplitude seems to work well. This issue is only apparent
when using a noise model with individually modelled red noise for all pulsars.
Our results for the blind challenges are in good agreement with the injected
values. For the GWB amplitudes we found h_c = 1.03 +/- 0.11 [10^{-14}], h_c =
5.70 +/- 0.35 [10^{-14}], and h_c = 6.91 +/- 1.72 [10^{-15}], and for the GWB
spectral index we found gamma = 4.28 +/- 0.20, gamma = 4.35 +/- 0.09, and gamma
= 3.75 +/- 0.40. We note that for closed challenge 3 there was quite some
covariance between the signal and the red noise: if we constrain the GWB
spectral index to the usual choice of gamma = 13/3, we obtain the estimates:
h_c = 10.0 +/- 0.64 [10^{-15}], h_c = 56.3 +/- 2.42 [10^{-15}], and h_c = 4.83

is one of the primary goals of ongoing radial velocity and transit exoplanet
surveys and proposed future space missions. Most current estimates of the
boundaries of the HZ are based on 1-D, cloud-free, climate model calculations
by Kasting et al.(1993). The inner edge of the HZ in Kasting et al.(1993) model
was determined by loss of water, and the outer edge was determined by the
maximum greenhouse provided by a CO2 atmosphere. A conservative estimate for
the width of the HZ from this model in our Solar system is 0.95-1.67 AU.
  Here, an updated 1-D radiative-convective, cloud-free climate model is used
to obtain new estimates for HZ widths around F, G, K and M stars. New H2O and
CO2 absorption coefficients, derived from the HITRAN 2008 and HITEMP 2010
line-by-line databases, are important improvements to the climate model.
According to the new model, the water loss (inner HZ) and maximum greenhouse
(outer HZ) limits for our Solar System are at 0.99 AU and 1.70 AU,
respectively, suggesting that the present Earth lies near the inner edge.
Additional calculations are performed for stars with effective temperatures
between 2600 K and 7200 K, and the results are presented in parametric form,
making them easy to apply to actual stars. The new model indicates that, near
the inner edge of the HZ, there is no clear distinction between runaway
greenhouse and water loss limits for stars with T_{eff} ~< 5000 K which has
implications for ongoing planet searches around K and M stars. To assess the
potential habitability of extrasolar terrestrial planets, we propose using
stellar flux incident on a planet rather than equilibrium temperature. Our
model does not include the radiative effects of clouds; thus, the actual HZ
boundaries may extend further in both directions than the estimates just given.

comparisons to an otherwise identical simulation run with the smoothed particle
hydrodynamics (SPH) code GADGET-3. Contrasting these two numerical approaches,
we find significant physical differences in the thermodynamic history of
accreted gas in haloes above 10^10.5 solar masses. In agreement with previous
work, GADGET simulations show a cold fraction near unity for galaxies forming
in massive haloes, implying that only a small percentage of accreted gas heats
to an appreciable fraction of the virial temperature during accretion. The same
galaxies in AREPO show a much lower cold fraction, <20% in haloes above 10^11
solar masses. This results from a hot gas accretion rate which, at this same
halo mass, is an order of magnitude larger than with GADGET, while the cold
accretion rate is also lower. These discrepancies increase for more massive
systems, and we explain both as due to numerical inaccuracies in the standard
formulation of SPH. We also observe that the relatively sharp transition from
cold to hot mode dominated accretion, at a halo mass of ~10^11, is a
consequence of comparing past gas temperatures to a constant threshold value
independent of virial temperature. Examining the spatial distribution of
accreting gas, we find that gas filaments in GADGET tend to remain collimated
and flow coherently to small radii, or artificially fragment and form a large
number of purely numerical ""blobs"". Similar gas streams in AREPO show increased
heating and disruption at 0.25-0.5 virial radii and contribute to the hot gas
accretion rate in a manner distinct from classical cooling flows.

an area of ongoing research, but the projected nature of observed coordinates
makes separating different populations of satellites (with different processes
at work) difficult. The orbital history of a satellite galaxy leads to its
present-day phase space coordinates; we can also work backwards and use these
coordinates to statistically infer information about the orbital history. We
use merger trees from the MultiDark Run 1 N-body simulation to compile a
catalog of the orbits of satellite haloes in cluster environments. We
parameterize the orbital history by the time since crossing within 2.5 rvir of
the cluster centre and use our catalog to estimate the probability density over
a range of this parameter given a set of present-day projected (i.e.
observable) phase space coordinates. We show that different populations of
satellite haloes, e.g. infalling, backsplash and virialized, occupy distinct
regions of phase space, and semi-distinct regions of projected phase space.
This will allow us to probabilistically determine the time since infall of a
large sample of observed satellite galaxies, and ultimately to study the effect
of orbital history on star formation history (the topic of a future paper). We
test the accuracy of our method and find that we can reliably recover this time
within +/-2.58 Gyr in 68 per cent of cases by using all available phase space
coordinate information, compared to +/-2.64 Gyr using only position coordinates
and +/-3.10 Gyr guessing 'blindly', i.e. using no coordinate information, but
with knowledge of the overall distribution of infall times. In some regions of
phase space, the accuracy of the infall time estimate improves to +/-1.85 Gyr.
Although we focus on time since infall, our method is easily generalizable to
other orbital parameters (e.g. pericentric distance and time).

1108+574, obtained during the 2012 outburst. Its quiescent spectrum is
unusually rich in helium, showing broad, double-peaked emission lines from the
accretion disc. We measure a line flux ratio HeI 5875/Halpha = 0.81 +/- 0.04, a
much higher ratio than typically observed in cataclysmic variables (CVs). The
outburst spectrum shows hydrogen and helium in absorption, with weak emission
of Halpha and HeI 6678, as well as strong HeII emission.
  From our photometry, we find the superhump period to be 56.34 +/- 0.18
minutes, in agreement with the previously published result. The spectroscopic
period, derived from the radial velocities of the emission lines, is found to
be 55.3 +/- 0.8 minutes, consistent with a previously identified photometric
orbital period, and significantly below the normal CV period minimum. This
indicates that the donor in SBSS 1108+574 is highly evolved. The superhump
excess derived from our photometry implies a mass ratio of q = 0.086 +/- 0.014.
Our spectroscopy reveals a grazing eclipse of the large outbursting disc. As
the disc is significantly larger during outburst, it is unlikely that an
eclipse will be detectable in quiescence. The relatively high accretion rate
implied by the detection of outbursts, together with the large mass ratio,
suggests that SBSS 1108+574 is still evolving towards its period minimum.

ground-state light-quark mesons and baryons at leading-order in a
symmetry-preserving truncation scheme for the Dyson-Schwinger equations using a
confining formulation of a contact-interaction at nonzero temperature. Meson
screening masses are obtained from Bethe-Salpeter equations; and baryon
analogues from a novel construction of the Faddeev equation, which employs an
improved quark-exchange approximation in the kernel. Our treatment implements a
deconfinement transition that is coincident with chiral symmetry restoration in
the chiral limit, when both transitions are second order. Despite
deconfinement, in all T=0 bound-state channels, strong correlations persist
above the critical temperature, T>T_c; and, in the spectrum defined by the
associated screening masses, degeneracy between parity-partner correlations is
apparent for T >1.3T_c. Notwithstanding these results, there are reasons
(including Golberger-Treiman relations) to suppose that the inertial masses of
light-quark bound-states, when they may be defined, vanish at the deconfinement
temperature; and that this is a signal of bound-state dissolution. Where a
sensible comparison is possible, our predictions are consistent with results

type Ia supernova can be derived as follows, using the following excellent
approximations: 1. the emission is powered solely by Ni56-> Co56 ->Fe56; 2.
each mass element propagates at a non-relativistic velocity which is constant
in time (free coasting); and 3. the internal energy is dominated by radiation.
Under these approximations, the energy E(t) carried by radiation in the ejecta
satisfies: dE/dt=-E(t)/t-L(t)+Q(t), where Q(t) is the deposition of energy by
the decay which is precisely known and L(t) is the bolometric luminosity. By
multiplying this equation by time and integrating over time we find:
E(t)*t=\int_0^t Q(t')t'dt' -\int_0^t L(t')t'dt'. At late time, t>> t_peak, the
energy inside the ejecta decreases rapidly due to its escape, and thus we have
\int_0^t Q(t')t'dt'=\int_0^t L(t')t'dt'. This relation is correct regardless of
the opacities, density distribution or Ni56 deposition distribution in the
ejecta and is very different from ""Arnett's rule"", L_peak ~ Q(t_peak). By
comparing \int_0^t Q(t')t'dt' with \int_0^t L(t')t'dt' at t~40 day after the
explosion, the mass of Ni56 can be found directly from UV, optical and infrared
observations with modest corrections due to the unobserved gamma-rays and due
to the small residual energy in the ejecta, E(t)*t>0.

document features. dCoT explicitly models absent words by removing and
reconstructing random sub-sets of words in the unlabeled corpus. With this
approach, dCoT learns to reconstruct frequent words from co-occurring

accreting black hole systems. In a previous paper we showed that the luminosity
of compact jets continuously launched due to accretion onto black holes in
X-ray binaries (analogous to those that dominate the kinetic feedback from AGN)
do not appear to correlate with reported black hole spin measurements. It is
therefore unclear whether extraction of the black hole spin energy is the main
driver powering compact jets from accreting black holes. Occasionally, black
hole X-ray binaries produce discrete, transient (ballistic) jets for a brief
time over accretion state changes. Here, we quantify the dependence of the
power of these transient jets (adopting two methods to infer the jet power) on
black hole spin, making use of all the available data in the current
literature, which includes 12 BHs with both measured spin parameters and radio
flares over the state transition. In several sources, regular, well-sampled
radio monitoring has shown that the peak radio flux differs dramatically
depending on the outburst (up to a factor of 1000) whereas the total power
required to energise the flare may only differ by a factor ~< 4 between
outbursts. The peak flux is determined by the total energy in the flare and the
time over which it is radiated (which can vary considerably between outbursts).
Using a Bayesian fitting routine we rule out a statistically significant
positive correlation between transient jet power measured using these methods,
and current estimates of black hole spin. Even when selecting subsamples of the
data that disregard some methods of black hole spin measurement or jet power
measurement, no correlation is found in all cases.

involving the web, social networks and bio-informatics. Recently, many such
applications generate data in the form of streams. Clustering massive, dynamic
graph streams is significantly challenging because of the complex structures of
graphs and computational difficulties of continuous data. Meanwhile, a large
volume of side information is associated with graphs, which can be of various
types. The examples include the properties of users in social network
activities, the meta attributes associated with web click graph streams and the
location information in mobile communication networks. Such attributes contain
extremely useful information and has the potential to improve the clustering
process, but are neglected by most recent graph stream mining techniques. In
this paper, we define a unified distance measure on both link structures and
side attributes for clustering. In addition, we propose a novel optimization
framework DMO, which can dynamically optimize the distance metric and make it
adapt to the newly received stream data. We further introduce a carefully
designed statistics SGS(C) which consume constant storage spaces with the
progression of streams. We demonstrate that the statistics maintained are
sufficient for the clustering process as well as the distance optimization and
can be scalable to massive graphs with side attributes. We will present
experiment results to show the advantages of the approach in graph stream
clustering with both links and side information over the baselines.

gas from the shallow potential wells of small, dwarf galaxies. During
cosmological reionization, this effect can result in negative feedback:
suppressing star-formation inside HII regions, thus impeding their continued
growth. It is difficult to model this process, given the enormous range of
scales involved. We tackle this problem using a tiered approach: combining
parameterized results from single-halo collapse simulations with large-scale
models of reionization. In the resulting reionization models, the ionizing
emissivity of galaxies depends on the local values of the reionization redshift
and the UVB intensity. We present a physically-motivated analytic expression
for the average minimum mass of star-forming galaxies, which can be readily
used in modeling galaxy formation. We find that UVB feedback: (i) delays the
end stages of reionization by less than 0.5 in redshift; (ii) results in a more
uniform distribution of HII regions, peaked on smaller-scales (with large-scale
ionization power suppressed by tens of percent); and (iii) suppresses the
global photoionization rate per baryon by a factor of < 2 towards the end of
reionization. However, the impact is modest, since the hydrodynamic response of
the gas to the UVB occurs on a time-scale comparable to reionization. In
particular, the popular approach of modeling UVB feedback with an instantaneous
transition in the minimum mass of star-forming galaxies, dramatically
overestimates its importance. UVB feedback does not significantly affect
reionization unless: (i) molecularly-cooled galaxies contribute significantly
to reionization; or (ii) internal feedback processes strongly couple with UVB
feedback in the early Universe. Since both are considered unlikely, we conclude
that there is no significant self-regulation of reionization by UVB feedback.

universe (z~>2), but not in the local universe. In the local universe
similar-mass (within a factor of two) galaxies tend to be a factor of 4 to 5
larger. Dry minor mergers are known to drive the evolution of the size of a
galaxy without much increasing the mass, but it is unclear if the growth in
size is sufficient to explain the observations. We test the hypothesis that
galaxies grow through dry minor mergers by simulating merging galaxies with
mass ratios of q=1:1 (equal mass) to q=1:160. In our N-body simulations the
total mass of the parent galaxy doubles. We confirm that major mergers do not
cause a sufficient growth in size. The observation can be explained with
mergers with a mass ratio of q=1:5--1:10. Smaller mass ratios cause a more
dramatic growth in size, up to a factor of ~17 for mergers with a mass ratio of
1:80. For relatively massive minor mergers q ~> 1:20 the mass of the incoming
child galaxies tend to settle in the halo of the parent galaxy. This is caused
by the tidal stripping of the child galaxies by the time they enter the central
portion of the parent. When the accretion of minor galaxies becomes more
continuous, when q <~ 1:40, the foreign mass tends to concentrate more in the
central region of the parent galaxy. We speculate that this is caused by
dynamic interactions between the child galaxies inside the merger remnant and
the longer merging times when the difference in mass is larger. These
interactions cause dynamical heating which results in accretion of mass inside
the galaxy core and a reduction of the parent's circular velocity and density.

variation (TV) minimization in recovering \emph{one-dimensional} signal with
sparse gradient support. This partially answers the open problem of proving the
fidelity of total variation minimization in such a setting \cite{TVMulti}. In
particular, we have shown that the recoverable gradient sparsity can grow
linearly with the signal dimension when TV minimization is used. Recoverable
sparsity thresholds of TV minimization are explicitly computed for
1-dimensional signal by using the Grassmann angle framework. We also extend our
results to TV minimization for multidimensional signals. Stability of
recovering signal itself using 1-D TV minimization has also been established
through a property called ""almost Euclidean property for 1-dimensional TV
norm"". We further give a lower bound on the number of random Gaussian
measurements for recovering 1-dimensional signal vectors with $N$ elements and
$K$-sparse gradients. Interestingly, the number of needed measurements is lower
bounded by $\Omega((NK)^{\frac{1}{2}})$, rather than the $O(K\log(N/K))$ bound

whether the accretion rate is significant. Our analysis suggests that material
is flowing along the filament's long axis at a rate of ~30Msol/Myr (inferred
from the N2H+ velocity gradient along the filament), and radially contracting
onto the filament at ~130Msol/Myr (inferred from HNC self-absorption). These
accretion rates are sufficient to supply mass to the central cluster at a
similar rate to the current star formation rate in the cluster. Filamentary
accretion flows may therefore be very important in the ongoing evolution of

transformations, though the axisymmetric and stationary solution space,
building an infinite tower of physically inequivalent solutions. As a specific
application, metrics associated to scalar hairy black holes, such as the ones
discovered by Bocharova, Bronnikov, Melnikov and Bekenstein, are embedded in
the external magnetic field of the Melvin universe.

The homogeneous geometry degrees of freedom are loop quantized, fact which
leads to the resolution of the cosmological singularity, while a Fock
quantization is employed for both matter and gravitational inhomogeneities.
Owing to the inclusion of the massless scalar field this system allows us to
modelize flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmologies filled with
inhomogeneities propagating in one direction. It provides a perfect scenario to
study the quantum back-reaction between the inhomogeneities and the polymeric

analogue of Young diagrams. In particular, we extend Babson-West's notion of
shape-Wilf equivalence to apply to alternating permutations and so generalize
results of Backelin-West-Xin and Ouchterlony to alternating permutations.
Second, we study pattern avoidance in the more general context of permutations
with restricted ascents and descents. We consider a question of Lewis regarding
permutations that are the reading words of thickened staircase Young tableaux,
that is, permutations that have (k - 1) ascents followed by a descent, followed
by (k - 1) ascents, et cetera. We determine the relative sizes of the sets of
pattern-avoiding (k - 1)-ascent permutations in terms of the forbidden pattern.
Furthermore, we give inequalities in the sizes of sets of pattern-avoiding
permutations in this context that arise from further extensions of
shape-equivalence type enumerations.

Markov process (\emph{model}) over a finite alphabet $\mathcal{A}$. Given any
string $\bf{w}$ of symbols from $\mathcal{A}$ we want estimates of the
conditional probability distribution of symbols following $\bf{w}$, as well as
the stationary probability of $\bf{w}$. Two distinct problems that complicate
estimation in this setting are (i) long memory, and (ii) \emph{slow mixing}
which could happen even with only one bit of memory.
  Any consistent estimator in this setting can only converge pointwise over the
class of all ergodic Markov models. Namely, given any estimator and any sample
size $n$, the underlying model could be such that the estimator performs poorly
on a sample of size $n$ with high probability. But can we look at a length-$n$
sample and identify \emph{if} an estimate is likely to be accurate?
  Since the memory is unknown \emph{a-priori}, a natural approach is to
estimate a potentially coarser model with memory $k_n=\mathcal{O}(\log n)$. As
$n$ grows, pointwise consistent estimates that hold eventually almost surely
(eas) are known so long as the scaling of $k_n$ is not superlogarithmic in $n$.
Here, rather than eas convergence results, we want the best answers possible
with a length-$n$ sample. Combining results in universal compression with
Aldous' coupling arguments, we obtain sufficient conditions on the length-$n$
sample (even for slow mixing models) to identify when naive (i) estimates of
the conditional probabilities and (ii) estimates related to the stationary
probabilities are accurate; and also bound the deviations of the naive
estimates from true values.

sequence stars in the magnitude range r' < 17 (i.e. masses > 0.8 solar) has a
shape that follows solar neighborhood star counts. However, at fainter
magnitudes the cluster LF is flat, in contrast with what would be expected from
solar neighborhood counts. The clustering properties of stars in NGC 2437 are
investigated by examining the two-point angular correlation functions of main

a larger area of the sky, suggesting that there is a corona of faint main

captured by neutron stars, the density will eventually become sufficient for
black hole formation. However, the dynamics of collapse is highly sensitive to
dark-matter self-interactions. Repulsive self-interactions, even if extremely
weak, can prevent black hole formation. We argue that self-interactions will
necessarily be present, and estimate their strength in representative models.
We also consider co-annihilation of dark matter with nucleons, which arises
naturally in many asymmetric dark matter models, and which again acts to
prevent black hole formation. We demonstrate how the excluded region of the
dark-matter parameter space shrinks as the strength of such interactions is
increased, and conclude that neutron star observations do not exclude most

low-energy quantum chromodynamics (QCD), has played and is still playing an
important role in our understanding of non-perturbative strong interaction
phenomena. In the past two decades, inspired by the rapid progress in lattice
QCD simulations and the new experimental campaign to study the strangeness
sector of low-energy QCD, many efforts have been made to develop a fully
covariant BChPT and to test its validity in all scenarios. These new endeavours
have not only deepened our understanding of some long-standing problems, such
as the power-counting-breaking problem and the convergence problem, but also
resulted in theoretical tools that can be confidently applied to make robust
predictions. Particularly, the manifestly covariant BChPT supplemented with the
extended-on-mass-shell (EOMS) renormalization scheme has been shown to satisfy
all analyticity and symmetry constraints and converge relatively faster
compared to its non-relativistic and infrared counterparts. In this article, we
provide a brief review of the fully covariant BChPT and its latest applications
in the $u$, $d$, and $s$ three-flavor sector.

The observed polarization depends on both the photon energy and the viewing
angle. With the typical bulk Lorentz factor $\Gamma \sim 200$, photons with
energy $E>10$ MeV tend to have smaller polarization than photons with energy
$E<1$ MeV. At the right viewing angle, i.e. $\theta \sim \Gamma^{-1}$, the
polarization achieves its maximal value, and the polarization angle changes
$90^{\circ}$ relative to the initial polarization direction. Thus, the

using single-crystal X-ray diffraction, where the space group is identified to
be Pa-3 and the lattice constant 40.5 angstrom. The structure is well described
as a dense packing of clusters of two kinds, which are known in the literature
as the pseudo-Mackay type and the Bergman type clusters. The clusters are
centered at the vertices of a canonical cell tiling, in which the parity of
each vertex determines the kind of the associated cluster. Adjacent clusters
can be markedly interpenetrated, while the structure requires no glue atoms to
fill in the gaps between the clusters. It is shown that the crystal can be
designated as a 2x2x2 superstructure of the ordinary cubic 3/2 rational

the P-type superlattice ordering previously reported in i-Al-Pd-Mn. The present

density in the transfer-matrix eigenvalues. The finite-size data for this
correlation length, combined with the scaling formula, reveal the location of
critical lines in the diagram. For $n>>2$ we find Ising-like phase transitions
associated with the onset of a checkerboard-like ordering of the elementary

which cover precisely one half of the faces of the square lattice at the

determine critical points in the range $-2\leq n\leq 2$. It is found that the

small sizes, a more modular system also has a less favorable energy at short

semilinear operator $\mathcal{A}(u)=Lu+\beta u-ku^2,$ where $L$ is a second
order elliptic operator, $\beta(\cdot)$ is in the Kato class and bounded from
above, and $k(\cdot)\ge 0$ is bounded on compact subsets of $\R^d$ and is
positive on a set of positive Lebesgue measure.
  The main purpose of this paper is to complement the results obtained in
\cite{Englander:2004}, in the following sense. Let $\lambda_\infty $ be the
$L^\infty$-growth bound of the semigroup corresponding to the Schr\""odinger
operator $L+\beta $. If $\lambda_\infty \neq0$, then we prove that, in some
sense, the exponential growth/decay rate of $\|X_t\|$, the total mass of $X_t$,
is $\lambda_\infty $. We also describe the limiting behavior of
$\exp(-\lambda_\infty t)\|X_t\|$ in these cases. This should be compared to the
result in \cite{Englander:2004}, which says that the generalized principal
eigenvalue $\lambda_2$ of the operator gives the rate of {\it local} growth
when it is positive, and implies local extinction otherwise. It is easy to show
that $\lambda_{\infty}\ge \lambda_2$, and we discuss cases when
$\lambda_{\infty}> \lambda_2$ and when $\lambda_{\infty}= \lambda_2$.
  When $\lambda_\infty =0$, and under some conditions on $\beta$, we give a
sufficient and necessary condition for the superdiffusion $X$ to exhibit weak
extinction. We show that the branching intensity $k$ affects weak extinction;
this should be compared to the known result that $k$ does not affect weak {\it
local} extinction (which only depends on the sign of $\lambda_2$, and which
turns out to be equivalent to local extinction) of $X$.

Shannon's (1948) mathematical theory of communication because ""information"" is
defined in the latter case as meaningless uncertainty. Assuming that meaning
cannot be communicated, we extend Shannon's theory by defining mutual
redundancy as a positional counterpart of the relational communication of
information. Mutual redundancy indicates the surplus of meanings that can be
provided to the exchanges in reflexive communications. The information is
redundant because based on ""pure sets,"" that is, without subtraction of mutual
information in the overlaps. We show that in the three-dimensional case (e.g.,
of a Triple Helix of university-industry-government relations), mutual
redundancy is equal to mutual information (Rxyz = Txyz); but when the
dimensionality is even, the sign is different. We generalize to the measurement
in N dimensions and proceed to the interpretation. Using Luhmann's
social-systems theory and/or Giddens' structuration theory, mutual redundancy
can be provided with an interpretation in the sociological case: different
meaning-processing structures code and decode with other algorithms. A surplus
of (""absent"") options can then be generated that add to the redundancy.
Luhmann's ""functional (sub)systems"" of expectations or Giddens' ""rule-resource
sets"" are positioned mutually, but coupled operationally in events or
""instantiated"" in actions. Shannon-type information is generated by the
mediation, but the ""structures"" are (re-)positioned towards one another as sets
of (potentially counterfactual) expectations. The structural differences among
the coding and decoding algorithms provide a source of additional options in
reflexive and anticipatory communications.

type-IX universe characterized by two scale factors in a gravity theory

cosmological constant creates a critical point of saddle type in the phase
space of the system. An orbit starting from a neighborhood of the separatrix
will evolve toward the critical point, and it eventually either expands to the
de Sitter space or collapses to the big crunch. In the closed FRW model, the
dynamics is reduced to hyperbolic motions in the two-dimensional center
manifold, and the system is not chaotic. In the anisotropic model, anisotropy
introduces the rotational mode, which interacts with the hyperbolic mode to
present a cylindrical structure of unstable periodic orbits in the neighborhood
of the critical point. Due to the non-integrability of the system, the
interaction of rotational and hyperbolic modes makes the system chaotic, making
it impossible for us to predict the final fate of the universe. We find that
the chaotic dynamics arises from the fact that orbits with even small
perturbations around the separatrix oscillate in the neighborhood of the
critical point before finally expanding or collapsing. The chaotic character is
also evidenced by the fractal structures in the basins of attraction.

problem of combinatorial complexity, an explosion in the number of species and
reactions due to myriad protein-protein interactions and post-translational
modifications. Rule-based modeling overcomes this problem by representing
molecules as structured objects and encoding their interactions as
pattern-based rules. This greatly simplifies the process of model
specification, avoiding the tedious and error prone task of manually
enumerating all species and reactions that can potentially exist in a system.
From a simulation perspective, rule-based models can be expanded
algorithmically into fully-enumerated reaction networks and simulated using a
variety of network-based simulation methods, provided that the network is not
exceedingly large. Alternatively, rule-based models can be simulated directly
using particle-based kinetic Monte Carlo methods. This ""network-free"" approach
produces exact stochastic trajectories with a computational cost that is
independent of network size. However, memory and run time costs increase with
the number of particles, limiting the size of system that can be feasibly
simulated. Here, we present a hybrid particle/population simulation method that
combines the best attributes of both the network-based and network-free
approaches. The method takes as input a rule-based model and a user-specified
subset of species to treat as population variables rather than as particles.
The model is then transformed by a process of ""partial network expansion"" into
a dynamically equivalent form that can be simulated using a population-adapted
network-free simulator. The transformation method has been implemented within
the open-source rule-based modeling platform BioNetGen, and resulting hybrid
models can be simulated using the particle-based simulator NFsim.

sources is poorly understood. Using the deepest X-ray observations made in the
Chandra Bulge Field (Revnivtsev et al., 2009,2011), we present the result of a
coherent photometric and spectroscopic analysis of individual X-ray point
sources for the purpose of constraining their nature and deriving their
fractional contributions to the hard band continuum and Fe K\alpha line
emission of the GRXE. Based on the X-ray color-color diagram, we divided the
point sources into three groups: A (hard), B (soft and broad spectrum), and C
(soft and peaked spectrum). The group A sources are further decomposed
spectrally into thermal and non-thermal sources with different fractions in
different flux ranges. From their X-ray properties, we speculate that the group
A non-thermal sources are mostly AGNs and the thermal sources are mostly white
dwarf (WD) binaries such as magnetic and non-magnetic cataclysmic variables
(CVs), pre-CVs, and symbiotic stars, whereas the group B and C sources are
X-ray active stars in flares and quiescence, respectively. In the log N-log S
curve of the 2-8 keV band, the group A non-thermal sources is dominant above
about 10^{-14} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}, which is gradually taken over by Galactic
sources in the fainter flux ranges. The Fe K\alpha emission is mostly from the
group A thermal (WD binaries) and the group B (X-ray active stars) sources.

and display excess emission in the mid-IR. Around solar-type stars, very few
objects show emission features in mid-IR spectroscopic observations, that are
attributed to small, warm silicate dust grains. The origin of this warm dust
can possibly be explained either by a collision between several bodies or by
transport from an outer belt. We present and analyse new far-IR Herschel/Pacs
observations, supplemented by ground-based data in the mid-IR (VLTI/Midi and
VLT/Visir), for one of these rare systems: the 10-16 Myr old debris disk around
HD 113766 A. We improve an existing model to account for these new
observations, and better constrain the spatial distribution of the dust and its
composition. We underline the limitations of SED modelling and the need for
spatially resolved observations. We find that the system is best described by
an inner disk located within the first AU, well constrained by the Midi data,
and an outer disk located between 9-13 AU. In the inner dust belt, our previous
finding of Fe-rich crystalline olivine grains still holds. We do not observe
time variability of the emission features over at least a 8 years time span, in
a environment subjected to strong radiation pressure. The time stability of the
emission features indicates that {\mu}m-sized dust grains are constantly
replenished from the same reservoir, with a possible depletion of
sub-{\mu}m-sized grains. We suggest that the emission features may arise from
multi-composition aggregates. We discuss possible scenarios concerning the
origin of the warm dust. The compactness of the innermost regions as probed by
Midi, as well as the dust composition, suggest that we are witnessing the
outcomes of (at least) one collision between partially differentiated bodies,
in an environment possibly rendered unstable by terrestrial planetary
formation.

mean-square error in the adaptive phase estimate may be further reduced below
the standard quantum limit for the stochastic noise process considered by using
a Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother as the estimator, alongwith an optimal Kalman
filter in the feedback loop. Further, the estimation using smoothing can be
made robust to uncertainties in the underlying parameters of the noise process
modulating the system phase to be estimated. This has been done using a robust
fixed-interval smoother designed for uncertain systems satisfying a certain

and investigate the correlation between the radio continuum (synchrotron) and
far-infrared (FIR) emission using the KINGFISH Herschel PACS and SPIRE data.
The radio--FIR correlation is studied as a function of star formation rate,
magnetic field strength, radiation field strength, and the total gas surface
brightness. The synchrotron emission follows both star-forming regions and the
so-called magnetic arms present in the inter-arm regions. The synchrotron
spectral index is steepest along the magnetic arms ($\alpha_n \sim 1$), while
it is flat in places of giant H{\sc ii} regions and in the center of the galaxy
($\alpha_n \sim 0.6-0.7$). The map of $\alpha_n$ provides an observational
evidence for aging and energy loss of cosmic ray electrons propagating in the
disk of the galaxy. Variations in the synchrotron--FIR correlation across the
galaxy are shown to be a function of both star formation and magnetic fields.
We find that the synchrotron emission correlates better with cold rather than
with warm dust emission, when the interstellar radiation field is the main
heating source of dust. The synchrotron--FIR correlation suggests a coupling
between the magnetic field and the gas density. NGC6946 shows a power-law
behavior between the total (turbulent) magnetic field strength B and the star
formation rate surface density $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ with an index of
0.14\,(0.16)$\pm$0.01. This indicates an efficient production of the turbulent
magnetic field with the increasing gas turbulence expected in actively star
forming regions. The scale-by-scale analysis of the synchrotron--FIR
correlation indicates that the ISM affects the propagation of old/diffused
cosmic ray electrons, resulting in a diffusion coefficient of $D_0=4.6\times
10^{28}$\,cm$^2$\,s$^{-1}$ for 2.2\,GeV CREs.

as a result van der Waals (vdW) forces can be expected to be of importance.
Here we account for the systematic poor treatment of vdW forces in most popular
density functional theory (DFT) exchange-correlation functionals by applying
accurate non-local vdW density functionals. We have computed the adsorption of
a variety of exemplar systems including water monomer adsorption on Al(111),
Cu(111), Cu(110), Ru(0001), Rh(111), Pd(111), Ag(111), Pt(111), and

show that non-local correlations contribute substantially to the water-metal
bond in all systems, whilst water-water bonding is much less affected by
non-local correlations. Interestingly non-local correlations contribute more to
the adsorption of water on the reactive transition metal substrates than they
do on the noble metals. The relative stability, adsorption sites, and
adsorption geometries of competing water adstructures rarely differ when
comparing results obtained with semi-local functionals and the non-local vdW
density functionals, which explains the previous success of semi-local

Twitter is an immensely popular micro-blogging network where people post short
messages of 140 characters called tweets. It has over 100 million active users
who post about 200 million tweets everyday. Phishers have started using Twitter
as a medium to spread phishing because of this vast information dissemination.
Further, it is difficult to detect phishing on Twitter unlike emails because of
the quick spread of phishing links in the network, short size of the content,
and use of URL obfuscation to shorten the URL. Our technique, PhishAri, detects
phishing on Twitter in realtime. We use Twitter specific features along with
URL features to detect whether a tweet posted with a URL is phishing or not.
Some of the Twitter specific features we use are tweet content and its
characteristics like length, hashtags, and mentions. Other Twitter features
used are the characteristics of the Twitter user posting the tweet such as age
of the account, number of tweets, and the follower-followee ratio. These
Twitter specific features coupled with URL based features prove to be a strong
mechanism to detect phishing tweets. We use machine learning classification
techniques and detect phishing tweets with an accuracy of 92.52%. We have
deployed our system for end-users by providing an easy to use Chrome browser
extension which works in realtime and classifies a tweet as phishing or safe.
We show that we are able to detect phishing tweets at zero hour with high
accuracy which is much faster than public blacklists and as well as Twitter's
own defense mechanism to detect malicious content. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first realtime, comprehensive and usable system to
detect phishing on Twitter.

different descriptions. Before comparing theoretical results with experiments,
one has to analyze thermodynamic stability of all these mixed states,

checked with regard to stratification instability. In addition to the static
stratification instability, there can happen dynamic instability occurring in a

the limiting minimax error probability of every supervised learning algorithm

parametric subsets of zero measure (in a suitable measure space). These results
expose the fundamental importance of prior knowledge and suggest that unless we

not convey information about the order of nodes within the path, there are many
feasible orders for each trace observed, and thus the problem of inferring the

algorithm which inserts edges by ordering each trace into a path according to
which pairs of nodes in the path co-occur most frequently in the observations.
When all traces involve exactly 3 nodes, we derive necessary and sufficient

repeater scheme. Recent progress in solid-state rare-earth-ion-doped systems
justifies their status as very strong candidates for such systems. Nonetheless
an optical memory based on spin-wave storage at the single-photon-level has not
been shown in such a system to date, which is crucial for achieving the long
storage times required for quantum repeaters. In this letter we show that it is
possible to execute a complete atomic frequency comb (AFC) scheme, including
spin-wave storage, with weak coherent pulses of $\bar{n} = 2.5 \pm 0.6$ photons
per pulse. We discuss in detail the experimental steps required to obtain this
result and demonstrate the coherence of a stored time-bin pulse. We show a
noise level of $(7.1 \pm 2.3)10^{-3}$ photons per mode during storage, this
relatively low-noise level paves the way for future quantum optics experiments
using spin-waves in rare-earth-doped crystals.

electronic evolution of the excited state and to provide significant
information beyond the time-resolved photoelectron spectrum (TRPES). Complex
temporal behaviour is observed in the TRPADs, revealing their sensitivity to
the dynamics while also emphasising the difficulty of interpretation of these
complex observables. From the experimental data some details of the wavepacket

external perturbations, i.e., the phenomenon of chaos pass filter, is
investigated for iterated maps. The distribution of distances, i.e., the
deviations between two synchronized chaotic units due to external perturbations
on the transfered signal, is used as a measure of the linear response. It is
calculated numerically and, for some special cases, analytically. Depending on
the model parameters this distribution has power law tails in the region of
synchronization leading to diverging moments of distances. This is a
consequence of multiplicative and additive noise in the corresponding linear
equations due to chaos and external perturbations. The linear response can also
be quantified by the bit error rate of a transmitted binary message which
perturbs the synchronized system. The bit error rate is given by an integral
over the distribution of distances and is calculated analytically and
numerically. It displays a complex nonmonotonic behavior in the region of
synchronization. For special cases the distribution of distances has a fractal
structure leading to a devil's staircase for the bit error rate as a function
of coupling strength. The response to small harmonic perturbations shows
resonances related to coupling and feedback delay times. A bi-directionally
coupled chain of three units can completely filtered out the perturbation. Thus
the second moment and the bit error rate become zero.

the power-law exponent is between 2 and 3, the second moment of the

nonfrozen nodes depends on the degree distribution exponent. Furthermore, the
exponent depends also on the dependence of the cutoff of the degree

different scaling laws depending on the type of cutoff as well as on the

lot of information (including personal) on and across OSM services every day.
For example, it is common to find a YouTube video embedded in a blog post with
an option to share the link on Facebook. Users recommend, comment, and forward
information they receive from friends, contributing in spreading the
information in and across OSM services. We term this information diffusion
process from one OSM service to another as Cross-Pollination, and the network
formed by users who participate in Cross-Pollination and content produced in
the network as \emph{Cross-Pollinated network}. Research has been done about
information diffusion within one OSM service, but little is known about
Cross-Pollination. In this paper, we aim at filling this gap by studying how
information (video, photo, location) from three popular OSM services (YouTube,
Flickr and Foursquare) diffuses on Twitter, the most popular microblogging
service. Our results show that Cross-Pollinated networks follow temporal and
topological characteristics of the diffusion OSM (Twitter in our study).
Furthermore, popularity of information on source OSM (YouTube, Flickr and
Foursquare) does not imply its popularity on Twitter. Our results also show
that Cross-Pollination helps Twitter in terms of traffic generation and user
involvement, but only a small fraction of videos and photos gain a significant
number of views from Twitter. We believe this is the first research work which
explicitly characterizes the diffusion of information across different OSM
services.

The
suggestion that a small scale dynamo acting at granular scales generates what
we call the quiet sun fields is studied in some detail. Although dynamo action
has been proved numerically, it is argued that current simulations are still
far from achieving the complexity that might be present on the Sun. We based
this statement not so much on the low magnetic Reynolds numbers used in the
simulations but, above all, in the smallness of the kinetic Reynolds numbers
employed by them. It is argued that the low magnetic Prandtl number at the
solar surface may pose unexpected problems for the identification of the
observed internetwork fields with dynamo action at granular scales. Some form
of turbulent dynamo at bigger (and deeper) scales is favored. The comparison
between the internetwork fields observed by Hinode and the magnetism inferred
from Hanle measurements are converging towards a similar description. They are
both described as randomly oriented, largely transverse fields in the several
hecto-Gauss range. These similarities are ever making more natural to assume
that they are the same. However, and because of the large voids of magnetic
flux observed in the spatial distribution of the internetwork fields, it is
argued that they are not likely to be generated by dynamo action in the
intergranular lanes. It is concluded that if a dynamo is acting at granular
scales, the end product might have not been observed yet at current spatial
resolutions and sensitivities with the Zeeman effect.

Communication between the mobile users and the base stations takes place over a
Gaussian interference channel with constant channel gains or quasi-static
fading. Instead, the base stations are connected to the central decoder through
orthogonal finite-capacity links, whose connectivity is subject to random
fluctuations. There is only receive-side channel state information, and hence
the mobile users are unaware of the channel state and of the backhaul
connectivity state, while the base stations know the fading coefficients but
are uncertain about the backhaul links' state. The base stations are oblivious
to the mobile users' codebooks and employ compress-and-forward to relay
information to the central decoder. Upper and lower bounds are derived on
average achievable throughput with respect to the prior distribution of the
fading coefficients and of the backhaul links' states. The lower bounds are
obtained by proposing strategies that combine the broadcast coding approach and
layered distributed compression techniques. The upper bound is obtained by
assuming that all the nodes know the channel state. Numerical results confirm
the advantages of the proposed approach with respect to conventional non-robust
strategies in both scenarios with and without fading.

  scaling of the YORP effect by the observed obliquity distribution","Accepted for publication in A&A, January 15, 2013",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201220701",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The larger number of models of asteroid shapes and their rotational states
derived by the lightcurve inversion give us better insight into both the nature
of individual objects and the whole asteroid population. With a larger
statistical sample we can study the physical properties of asteroid
populations, such as main-belt asteroids or individual asteroid families, in
more detail. Shape models can also be used in combination with other types of
observational data (IR, adaptive optics images, stellar occultations), e.g., to
determine sizes and thermal properties. We use all available photometric data
of asteroids to derive their physical models by the lightcurve inversion method
and compare the observed pole latitude distributions of all asteroids with
known convex shape models with the simulated pole latitude distributions. We
used classical dense photometric lightcurves from several sources and
sparse-in-time photometry from the U.S. Naval Observatory in Flagstaff,
Catalina Sky Survey, and La Palma surveys (IAU codes 689, 703, 950) in the
lightcurve inversion method to determine asteroid convex models and their
rotational states. We also extended a simple dynamical model for the spin
evolution of asteroids used in our previous paper. We present 119 new asteroid
models derived from combined dense and sparse-in-time photometry. We discuss
the reliability of asteroid shape models derived only from Catalina Sky Survey
data (IAU code 703) and present 20 such models. By using different values for a
scaling parameter cYORP (corresponds to the magnitude of the YORP momentum) in
the dynamical model for the spin evolution and by comparing synthetics and
observed pole-latitude distributions, we were able to constrain the typical
values of the cYORP parameter as between 0.05 and 0.6.

ejection (CME) to validate a method for calculating propagation directions and
kinematical profiles of interplanetary CMEs (ICMEs). In this method
observations from heliospheric images are constrained with in-situ plasma and
field data at 1 AU. These data are used to convert measured ICME elongations
into distance by applying the Harmonic Mean approach that assumes a spherical
shape of the ICME front. We use synthetic white-light images, similar as
observed by STEREO-A/HI, for three different separation angles between remote
and in-situ spacecraft, of 30{\deg}, 60{\deg}, and 90{\deg}. To validate the
results of the method they are compared to the apex speed profile of the
modeled ICME, as obtained from a top view. This profile reflects the ""true""
apex kinematics since it is not affected by scattering or projection effects.
In this way it is possible to determine the accuracy of the method for
revealing ICME propagation directions and kinematics. We found that the
direction obtained by the constrained Harmonic Mean method is not very
sensitive to the separation angle (30{\deg} sep: \phi = W7; 60{\deg} sep: \phi
= W12; 90{\deg} sep: \phi = W15; true dir.: E0/W0). For all three cases the
derived kinematics are in a relatively good agreement with the real kinematics.
The best consistency is obtained for the 30{\deg} case, while with growing
separation angle the ICME speed at 1 AU is increasingly overestimated (30{\deg}
sep: \Delta V_arr ~-50 km/s, 60{\deg} sep: \Delta V_arr ~+75 km/s, 90{\deg}
sep: \Delta V_arr ~+125 km/s). Especially for future L4/L5 missions the
60{\deg} separation case is highly interesting in order to improve space
weather forecasts.

low power coding technique by decreasing the number of switching activities on
the buses which use transition signaling to transmit data. This approach
dedicates the symbols with less ones to high probability data. MFLP unlike the
most low power encoding does not rely on spatial redundancy. Due to this
superiority, MFLP is unique in power decreasing in the Network on Chip (NoC).
Not only does this algorithm reduce the power consumption, but also it can
compress the data. It offers a tradeoff to designers to choose between
compression and power; that is, the more power consumption decrease we need,
the less compression we earn. This coding uses tree based infrastructure in
order to decrease the number of ones to reduce the switching activities, and
the power consumption consequently. The proposed algorithm constructs the tree
with this contribution that code words with less ones are allocated to more
frequent data. The experimental results for the outside and inside of the NoC
indicate that the proposed coding algorithm reduces the switching activity up
to 30 and 45%, the link power consumption up to 35 and 46% and the total power
dissipation up to 34.9 and 16% for the outside and inside of the NoC,

regardless of the bandwidth (bandwidth can even be negligibly small). Second,
this result shows that the capacity is irrespective of the size of the region

the maximum degrees of freedom is proportional to the surface area containing

calculations of the virtual water available through the food trade network, we
point to the existence of a global water unbalance. We suggest that current
export rates will not be maintained and consequently we question the long-run
sustainability of the food trade system as a whole. Water rich regions are
likely to soon reduce the amount of virtual water they export, thus leaving
import-dependent regions without enough water to sustain their populations. We
also investigate the potential impact of possible scenarios that might mitigate
these effects through (1) cooperative interactions among nations whereby water
rich countries maintain a tiny fraction of their food production available for
export; (2) changes in consumption patterns; and (3) a positive feedback

simulations by means of state-of-the art force-fields to study the implantation
of a single Au nanocluster on a Polydimethylsiloxane substrate. All the
simulations have ben performed on realistic substrate models containing up to
4.6 millions of atoms having depths up to 90 nm and lateral dimensions up to 25
nm. We consider both entangled-melt and cross-linked Polydimethylsiloxane
amorphous structures. We show that even a single cluster impact on the
Polydimethylsiloxane substrate remarkably changes the polymer local temperature
and pressure. Moreover we observe the presence of craters created on the
polymer surface having lateral dimensions comparable to the cluster radius and
depths strongly dependent on the implantation energy. Present simulations
suggest that the substrate morphology is largely affected by the cluster impact
and that most-likely such modifications favor the the penetration of the next
impinging clusters.

In this way several physically important equations are recovered from the
quantum defect. In particular, sliding problems are solved for radial
Schr\""odinger equation, radial Dirac system and multidimensional Schr\""odinger
equation. Systems with Coulomb-type potentials are considered as well.

  the magnetospheric collisionless plasma",,,,,"physics.plasm-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dynamics of the magnetospheric plasma configuration intrinsically features
intermittent slow and fast phases. The fast transition is a nonlinear process,
loss of equilibrium which ends up the slow quasi-static evolution. The process
is analysed as a dynamical bifurcation. It appears when marginal stability
state is reached in the course of that evolution, either for tearing mode or
for ballooning mode disturbances. The resulting force imbalance leads to
spontaneous formation of nonlinear kinetic thin current structures. Those are
either a pair of slow collisionless shocks or a specific anisotropic thin
current sheet embedded in a thicker plasma sheet structure. Both are the sites
of intense energy conversion, and they implement fast magnetic reconnection in
the magnetospheric collisionless plasma.

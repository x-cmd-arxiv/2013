five-dimensional supergravity and four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell gravity to
three dimensions gives rise to a sequence of cosets $O(4,3)/(O(4)\times
O(3))\supset G_{2(2)}/(SU(2)\times SU(2))\supset SU(2,1)/S(U(2)\times U(1))$
which are invariant subspaces of each other. The known matrix representations
of these cosets, however, are not suitable to realize these embeddings which
could be useful for solution generation. We construct a new representation of
the largest coset in terms of $7\times 7$ real symmetric matrices and show how
to select invariant subspaces corresponding to lower cosets by algebraic
constraints. The new matrix representative may be also directly applied to
minimal five-dimensional supergravity. Due to full O(4,3) covariance it is
simpler than the one derived by us previously for the coset
$G_{2(2)}/(SU(2)\times SU(2))$.

themes in the study of unconventional superconductors, such as high-Tc
cuprates, iron pnictides and heavy fermions. In such systems, the same d- or
f-electrons tend to form magnetically ordered states and participate in
building up a high density of states at the Fermi level, which is responsible
for the superconductivity. Charge-density-wave (CDW) is another fascinating
collective quantum phenomenon in some low dimensional materials, like the
prototypical transition-metal poly-chalcogenides, in which CDW instability is
frequently found to accompany with superconducting transition at low
temperatures. Remarkably, similar to the antiferromagnetic superconductors,
superconductivity can also be achieved upon suppression of CDW order via
chemical doping or applied pressure in 1T-TiSe2. However, in these CDW
superconductors, the two ground states are believed to occur in different parts
of Fermi surface (FS) sheets, derived mainly from chalcogen p-states and
transition metal d-states, respectively. The origin of superconductivity and
its interplay with CDW instability has not yet been unambiguously determined.
Here we report on the discovery of bulk superconductivity in Pd-intercalated
CDW RETen (RE=rare earth; n=2.5, 3) compounds, which belong to a large family
of rare-earth poly-chalcogenides with CDW instability usually developing in the
planar square nets of tellurium at remarkably high transition temperature and
the electronic properties are also dominated by chalcogen p-orbitals. Our study
demonstrates that the intercalation of palladium leads to the suppression of
the CDW order and the emergence of the superconductivity. Our finding could
provide an ideal model system for comprehensive studies of the interplay
between CDW and superconductivity.

populations of energetic particles. In ITER-type fusion reactors, such
populations can be generated by fusion reactions or auxiliary heating. The
electron-driven fishbone mode results from the resonant interaction of the
internal kink mode with the slow toroidal precessional motion of energetic
electrons and is frequently observed in present-day tokamaks with Electron
Cyclotron Resonance Heating or Lower Hybrid Current Drive. In Tore Supra,
electron-driven fishbones are observed during LHCD-powered discharges in which
a high-energy tail of the electronic distribution function is created. Although
the destabilization of those modes is related to the existence of a fast
particle population, the modes are observed at a frequency that is lower than
expected. The linear stability analysis of electron-driven fishbone modes is
the main focus of this thesis. The fishbone dispersion relation is derived in a
form that accounts for the contribution of the parallel motion of passing
particles to the resonance condition. The MIKE code is developed to compute and
solve the dispersion relation of electron-driven fishbones. The code is
successfully benchmarked against theory using simple analytical distributions.
Using the code MIKE with parametric distributions and equilibria, we show that
both barely trapped and barely passing electrons resonate with the mode and can
drive it unstable. More deeply trapped and passing electrons have a
non-resonant effect on the mode that is, respectively, stabilizing and
destabilizing. MIKE simulations using complete ECRH-like distribution functions
show that energetic barely passing electrons can contribute to drive a mode
unstable at a relatively low frequency. This observation could provide some
insight to the understanding of Tore Supra experiments.

for testing current star formation models. Stars are more often found in
multiple systems, the more massive they are. A complete knowledge of the
multiplicity of high-mass stars over the full range of orbit separations is
thus essential to understand their still debated formation process.
Observations of the Orion Nebula Cluster can help to answer the question about
the origin and evolution of multiple stars. Earlier studies provide a good
knowledge about the multiplicity of the stars at very small (spectroscopic) and
large separations (AO, speckle) and thus make the ONC a good target for such a
project. We used the NIR interferometric instrument AMBER at VLTI to observe a
sample of bright stars in the ONC. We complement our data set by archival NACO
observations of \theta 1 Ori A to obtain more information about the orbit of
the close visual companion. Our observations resolve the known multiple systems
\theta 1 Ori C and \theta 1 Ori A and provide new orbit points, which confirm
the predicted orbit and the determined stellar parameters for \theta 1 Ori C.
Combining AMBER and NACO data for \theta 1 Ori A we were able to follow the
motion of the companion from 2003 to 2011. We furthermore find hints for a
companion around \theta 1 Ori D and a previously unknown companion to NU Ori.
With a probability of ~90% we can exclude further companions with masses of > 3
Msun around our sample stars for separations between ~2 mas and ~110 mas. We
conclude that the companion around \theta 1 Ori A is most likely physically
related to the primary star. The newly discovered possible companions further
increase the multiplicity in the ONC. For our sample of two O and three B-type
stars we find on average 2.5 known companions per primary, which is around five
times more than for low-mass stars.

are widely used in embedded systems for the industrial automation domain. We
propose a framework for the formal treatment of PLC based on the IEC 61131-3
standard. A PLC system description typically combines code written in different
languages that are defined in IEC 61131-3. For the top-level specification we
regard the Sequential Function Charts (SFC) language, a graphical high-level
language that allows to describe the main control-flow of the system. In
addition to this, we describe the Instruction List (IL) language -- an assembly
like language -- and two other graphical languages: Ladder Diagrams (LD) and
Function Block Diagrams (FBD). IL, LD, and FBD are used to describe more low
level structures of a PLC. We formalize the semantics of these languages and
describe and prove relations between them. Formalization and associated proofs
are carried out using the proof assistant Coq. In addition to this, we present
work on a tool for automatically generating SFC representations from a
graphical description -- the IL and LD languages can be handled in Coq directly
-- and its usage for verification purposes. We sketch possible usages of our
formal framework, and present an example application for a PLC in a project
demonstrator and prove safety properties.

Si II and Si III can lead to quite discordant results in mid to late B-type
stars. The difference between the Si abundances derived from the two ion states
can exceed one dex in some cases.
  We have carried out a study intended to clarify which kinds of B stars
exhibit this discrepancy, to try to identify regularities in the phenomenon,
and to explore possible explanations such as abundance stratification by
comparing models to observed spectra.
  We used spectra from the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter and FEROS spectrograph,
supplemented with spectra from the ESO and ELODIE archives, of magnetic Bp,
HgMn, and normal B-type stars ranging in effective temperature from about 10500
to 15000 K. Using these spectra, we derived abundances using the spectrum
synthesis program ZEEMAN which can take into account the influence of magnetic
fields. For each star, accurate abundances of Si II, Si III, Ti, Cr, and Fe
were derived.
  All magnetic Bp stars in our sample show a discordance between the derived
abundances of the first and second ions of silicon, with the latter being
between 0.6 - 1.7 dex higher. The same behaviour is observed in the
non-magnetic stars but to a much smaller extent: Si III is enhanced by between
0.3 - 0.8 dex compared to Si II.We do not detect the discrepancy in three
stars, HD 22136 (normal), HD 57608 (HgMn) and HD 27295 (HgMn); these are the
only stars in our sample for which the microturbulence parameter is
significantly different from zero, and which therefore probably have convection
occurring in their atmospheres.
  We find that vertical stratification of silicon in the atmospheres of B-type
stars may provide an explanation of this phenomenon, but our detailed
stratification models do not completely explain the discrepancies, which may,
in part, be due to non-LTE effects.

inner-Galaxy HII region W 39. Radio recombination line observations combined
with HI absorption spectra and Galactic rotation models show that the region
lies at V(LSR) = +65.4+/-0.5 km/s corresponding to a near kinematic distance of
4.5+/-0.2 kpc. Analysis of radio continuum emission shows that the HII region
is being powered by a cluster of OB stars with a combined hydrogen-ionizing
luminosity of log(Q) >=50, and that there are three compact HII regions located
on the periphery of W 39, each with log(Q)~48.5 (single O7 - O9 V star
equivalent). In the infrared, W 39 has a hierarchical bubble morphology, and is
a likely site of sequential star formation involving massive stars. Kinematic
models of the expansion of W 39 yield timescales of order Myr consistent with a
scenario where the formation of the smaller HII regions has been triggered by
the expansion of W 39. Using Spitzer GLIMPSE and MIPSGAL data we show that
star-formation activity is not distributed uniformly around the periphery of W
39 but is concentrated in two areas that include the compact HII regions as
well as a number of intermediate-mass Class I and Class II YSOs.

chromospheric activity in young low-mass pre-main sequence stars introduces
uncertainties when measuring mass accretion rates in accreting (Class II) Young
Stellar Objects. A detailed investigation of the effect of chromospheric
emission on the estimates of mass accretion rate in young low-mass stars is
still missing. This can be undertaken using samples of young diskless (Class
III) K and M-type stars. Aims. Our goal is to measure the chromospheric
activity of Class III pre main sequence stars to determine its effect on the
estimates of accretion luminosity (Lacc) and mass accretion rate (Macc) in
young stellar objects with disks. Methods. Using VLT/X-Shooter spectra we have
analyzed a sample of 24 non-accreting young stellar objects of spectral type
between K5 and M9.5. We identify the main emission lines normally used as
tracers of accretion in Class II objects, and we determine their fluxes in
order to estimate the contribution of the chromospheric activity to the line
luminosity. Results. We have used the relationships between line luminosity and
accretion luminosity derived in the literature for Class II objects to evaluate
the impact of chromospheric activity on the accretion rate measurements. We
find that the typical chromospheric activity would bias the derived accretion
luminosity by Lacc,noise< 10-3Lsun, with a strong dependence with the Teff of
the objects. The noise on Macc depends on stellar mass and age, and the typical
values of log(Macc,noise) range between -9.2 to -11.6Msun/yr. Conclusions.
Values of Lacc< 10-3Lsun obtained in accreting low-mass pre main sequence stars
through line luminosity should be treated with caution as the line emission may
be dominated by the contribution of chromospheric activity.

mathematical formulation of framed and unframed BPS degeneracies in terms of
motivic and cohomological Donaldson-Thomas invariants. We verify the
conjectured absence of BPS states with ""exotic"" SU(2)_R quantum numbers using
motivic DT invariants. This application is based in particular on a complete

extract current-voltage characteristics from universal low-bias up to high-bias
regimes, where band effects start to play a dominant role. We discuss three
quenches, which after strongly quench-dependent transients yield the same
steady-state current. Among these quenches we identify those favorable for
extracting steady-state observables. The period of short-time oscillations is
shown to compare well to real-time renormalization group results for a simpler
model of spinless fermions. We find indications that many-body effects play an
important role at high-bias voltage and finite bandwidth of the metallic leads.
The growth of entanglement entropy after a certain time scale (proportional to
the inverse of Delta) is the major limiting factor for calculating the time
evolution. We show that the magnitude of the steady-state current positively
correlates with entanglement entropy. The role of high-energy states for the

G152.4-2.1 and G190.9-2.2, using Canadian Galactic Plane Survey data. The aims
of this paper are, first, to present evidence that favours the classification
of both sources as SNRs, and, second, to describe basic parameters (integrated
flux density, spectrum, and polarization) as well as properties (morphology,
line-of-sight velocity, distance and physical size) to facilitate and motivate
future observations. Spectral and polarization parameters are derived from
multiwavelength data from existing radio surveys carried out at wavelengths
between 6 and 92cm. In particular for the source G152.4-2.1 we also use new
observations at 11cm done with the Effelsberg 100m telescope. The interstellar
medium around the discovered sources is analyzed using 1-arcminute line data
from neutral hydrogen (HI) and 45-arcsecond 12CO(J=1-0). G152.4-2.1 is a barrel
shaped SNR with two opposed radio-bright polarized flanks on the North and
South. The remnant, which is elongated along the Galactic plane is evolving in
a more-or-less uniform medium. G190.9-2.2 is also a shell-type remnant with
East and West halves elongated perpendicular to the plane, and is evolving
within a low-density region bounded by dense neutral hydrogen in the North and
South, and molecular (12CO) clouds in the East and West. The integrated radio
continuum spectral indices are -0.65+/-0.05 and -0.66+/-0.05 for G152.4-2.1 and
G190.9-2.2 respectively. Both SNRs are approximately 1 kpc distant, with
G152.4-2.1 being larger (32x30 pc in diameter) than G190.9-2.2 (18x16 pc).
These two remnants are the lowest surface brightness SNRs yet catalogued at
5x10^-23 W m^-2 Hz^-1 sr^-1.

bioinformatic tools currently available allow for a systematic study of gene
colocalization across several, evolutionarily distant species. Kerfuffle is a
web tool designed to help discover, visualize, and quantify the physical
organization of genomes by identifying significant gene colocalization and
conservation across the assembled genomes of available species (currently up to
47, from humans to worms). Kerfuffle only requires the user to specify a list
of human genes and the names of other species of interest. Without further
input from the user, the software queries the e!Ensembl BioMart server to
obtain positional information and discovers homology relations in all genes and
species specified. Using this information, Kerfuffle performs a multi-species
clustering analysis, presents downloadable lists of clustered genes, performs
Monte Carlo statistical significance calculations, estimates how conserved gene
clusters are across species, plots histograms and interactive graphs, allows
users to save their queries, and generates a downloadable visualization of the
clusters using the Circos software. These analyses may be used to further
explore the functional roles of gene clusters by interrogating the enriched
molecular pathways associated with each cluster.

Addressing this challenge Spracklen et al. recently presented a pan-tropical
study of rainfall and land-cover that showed that satellite-derived rainfall
measures were positively correlated with the degree to which model-derived air
trajectories had been exposed to forest cover. This result confirms the
influence of vegetation on regional rainfall patterns suggested in previous
studies. However, we find that the conclusion of Spracklen et al. -- that
differences in rainfall reflect air moisture content resulting from
evapotranspiration while the circulation pattern remains unchanged -- appears
undermined by methodological inconsistencies. We identify methodological
problems with the underlying analyses and the quantitative estimates for
rainfall change predicted if forest cover is lost in the Amazon. We discuss
some alternative explanations that include the distinct role of forest
evapotranspiration in creating low pressure systems that draw moisture from the
oceans to the continental hinterland. Our analysis of meteorological data from
three regions in Brazil, including the central Amazon forest, reveal a tendency
for rainy days during the wet season with column water vapor (CWV) exceeding 50
mm to have higher pressure than rainless days; while at lower CWV rainy days
tend to have lower pressure than rainless days. The coupling between
atmospheric moisture content and circulation dynamics underlines that the
danger posed by forest loss is greater than suggested by focusing only on
moisture recycling alone.

the evolution of a density inhomogeneity in the ejecta profile. We explored

very sensitive to its initial position within the ejecta, while the dependence

Efficient thermal conduction produces detectable effects by determining an

this study, in this paper, we show that choosing the Euclidean vacuum ensures
the gauge invariance in the local universe and hence the IR regularity of loop
corrections. It has been suggested that loop corrections to inflationary
perturbations may yield the secular growth, which can lead to the break down of
the perturbative analysis in an extremely long term inflation. The absence of
the secular growth has been claimed by picking up only the IR contributions,
which we think is incomplete because the non-IR modes which are comparable to
or smaller than the Hubble scale potentially can contribute to the secular
growth. We prove the absence of the secular growth without neglecting these
non-IR modes to a certain order in the perturbative expansion. We also discuss
how the regularity of the n-point functions for the genuinely gauge invariant
variable constrains the initial states of the inflationary universe. These
results apply in a fully general single field model of inflation.

These structures correspond to an equilibrium between the pressure forces and
the ponderomotive force resulting from high frequency Langmuir oscillations.
Langmuir cavitons are typical features of strong Langmuir turbulence expected
to be generated at high energy and to saturate when Langmuir energy is of the
order of the plasma thermal energy. Despite this wide-spread belief, here we
observe that cavitons, emerging from weak Langmuir turbulence evolution,
saturate at much lower energies. We show that these Langmuir coherent
structures are characterized by a much larger length scale with respect to the
Debye length. This gives evidence that ""large"" and ""shallow"" stable cavitons
should be seen in space plasma observations. The transition toward strong
turbulence is shown to be a consequence of an initial weak turbulent inverse
cascade. Finally, the effective equation of state for ion acoustic oscillations

10^13 M_sun at z=0, using the Adaptive Mesh Refinement code RAMSES. These
simulations explore the role of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), through jets
powered by the accretion onto supermassive black holes on the formation of
massive elliptical galaxies. In the absence of AGN feedback, large amounts of
stars accumulate in the central galaxies to form overly massive, blue, compact
and rotation-dominated galaxies. Powerful AGN jets transform the central
galaxies into red extended and dispersion-dominated galaxies. This
morphological transformation of disc galaxies into elliptical galaxies is
driven by the efficient quenching of the in situ star formation due to AGN
feedback, which transform these galaxies into systems built up by accretion.
For galaxies mainly formed by accretion, the proportion of stars deposited
farther away from the centre increases, and galaxies have larger sizes. The
accretion is also directly responsible for randomising the stellar orbits,
increasing the amount of dispersion over rotation of stars as a function of
time. Finally, we find that our galaxies simulated with AGN feedback better
match the observed scaling laws, such as the size-mass, velocity
dispersion-mass, fundamental plane relations, and slope of the total density
profiles at z~0, from dynamical and strong lensing constraints.

the fine structure constant $\alpha$ in space and time. A model construction
method is described, where variations of $\alpha$ and other FPCs (including the
gravitational constant $G$) follow from the dynamics of extra space-time
dimensions in the framework of curvature-nonlinear multidimensional theories of
gravity. An advantage of this method is a unified approach to variations of
different FPCs. A particular model explaining the observable variations of
$\alpha$ in space and time has been constructed. It comprises a FRW cosmology
with accelerated expansion, perturbed due to slightly inhomogeneous initial

kinematic correlation between SiO (2--1) and CH3OH emission from four Galactic
center clouds: the +50 and +20 km/s clouds and G0.13-0.13 and G0.25+0.01. The
enhanced abundance of methanol is accounted for in terms of induced
photodesorption by cosmic rays as they travel through a molecular core,
collide, dissociate, ionize, and excite Lyman Werner transitions of H2. A
time-dependent chemical model in which cosmic rays drive the chemistry of the

we first deduce the amplitude response function of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)

realistic parameters, this function supports a relatively broad signal passband
and contains a resonance. We confirm the validity of our predicted amplitude

decay of the core hole as a function of delay between the photoexcitation and
SXR pulses. The core hole decay is particularly sensitive to the local valence
electrons near the core and shows new types of propensity rules, compared to
dipole selection rules in SXR absorption or emission spectroscopy. We apply the
delayed ultrafast x-ray Auger probing (DUXAP) method to the specific problem of
nucleobase photoprotection to demonstrate its potential. The ultraviolet
photoexcited \pi\pi* states of nucleobases are prone to chemical reactions with
neighboring bases. To avoid this, the single molecules funnel the \pi\pi*
population to lower lying electronic states on an ultrafast timescale under
violation of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. The new type of propensity
rule, which is confirmed by Auger decay simulations, allows us to have
increased sensitivity on the direct relaxation from the \pi\pi* state to the

quantum spin liquid phase acquires multiple enhancements due to the strong SOC,
reduced band-width and on-site spin-orbital exchange, while the heat capacity
does not change much across MIT. This explains the large Wilson ratio of the

characterized by its dependence on the incident and scattered light
polarization as well as on the magnetic field strength and orientation. Model
schemes of electric-dipole allowed spin-flip Raman processes in the exciton
complexes are compared to the experimental observations, from which we find
that lowering of the exciton symmetry, time of carrier spin relaxation, and
mixing between electron states and, respectively, light- and heavy-hole states
play an essential role in the scattering. At the exciton resonance, anisotropic
exchange interaction induces heavy-hole spin-flip scattering, while acoustic
phonon interaction is mainly responsible for the electron spin-flip. In
resonance with the positively and negatively charged excitons, anisotropic
electron-hole exchange as well as mixed electron states allow spin-flip
scattering. Variations in the resonant excitation energy and lattice
temperature demonstrate that localization of resident electrons and holes
controls the Raman process probability and is also responsible for symmetry
reduction. We show that the intensity of the electron spin-flip scattering is
strongly affected by the lifetime of the exciton complex and in tilted magnetic
fields by the angular dependence of the anisotropic electron-hole exchange
interaction.

evenly distributed. An image treatment has been devised to account for the
camera dark current and flat field, using IRAF routines. A study of the
observational conditions upon the final outcome was made. The mean temperature
at the observation is shown as the most influential parameter upon the final
result. Next to it also the temperature variation, the Fried's factor, and the
standard deviation of the reflected parabola presented a minor and complex
degree of influence. The derived corrections are of the order of hundredths of
arc seconds, thus being tenfold smaller than the typical error of one
observation. The mean semidiameter for the time lapse (1998-2000) is found as

the semi diameter were obtained. The largest amplitude has a period of 515
days. By using a second type of algorithm, namely the DCDFT, the found periods
were confirmed. A dependency of the semidiameter on the observed heliolatitude
is verified. The difference between the equatorial and polar radii was

models since they can correspond to Yukawa couplings, Majorana mass terms for
right-handed neutrinos or Polonyi terms, relevant for supersymmetry breaking.
In the last part, we make use of various string dualities in order to compute
multi-instanton corrections which are otherwise technically difficult to obtain
from explicit D-instanton calculations. We compute one-loop diagrams with BPS
particles in type IIA string theory configurations, involving spacefilling
D-branes and orientifolds, and obtain exact quantum corrections in the dual
type IIB picture, including infinite series of D-instanton contributions. By
lifting the one-loop calculations to the M-theory picture, we obtain a
geometric understanding of the non-perturbative sector of a wide range of gauge
theories and elucidate the underlying symmetries of the effective action.

pricing model, within which we introduce a new parallel method for the
calibration of the industry standard SABR (stochastic-\alpha \beta \rho)
stochastic volatility model using three strike inputs. SABR calibration
involves a non-linear three dimensional minimisation and parallelisation is
achieved by incorporating several assumptions unique to the SABR class of
models. Our calibration method is based on principles of surface intersection,
guarantees convergence to a unique solution and operates by iteratively
refining a two dimensional grid with local mesh refinement. As part of our
pricing model we additionally present a fast parallel iterative algorithm for
the creation of dynamically sized cumulative probability lookup tables that are
able to cap maximum estimated linear interpolation error. We optimise
performance for probability distributions that exhibit clustering of linear
interpolation error. We also make an empirical assessment of error propagation
through our pricing model as a result of changes in accuracy parameters within
the pricing model's multiple algorithmic steps. Algorithms are implemented on a
GPU (graphics processing unit) using Nvidia's Fermi architecture. The pricing
model targets the evaluation of spread options using copula methods, however
the presented algorithms can be applied to a wider class of financial

course of 40 Myr, we systematically relax the classic Bondi assumptions in a
typical galaxy hosting a SMBH. In the realistic scenario, where the hot gas is
cooling, while heated and stirred on large scales, the accretion rate is
boosted up to two orders of magnitude compared with the Bondi prediction. The
cause is the nonlinear growth of thermal instabilities, leading to the
condensation of cold clouds and filaments when t_cool/t_ff < 10. Subsonic
turbulence of just over 100 km/s (M > 0.2) induces the formation of thermal
instabilities, even in the absence of heating, while in the transonic regime
turbulent dissipation inhibits their growth (t_turb/t_cool < 1). When heating
restores global thermodynamic balance, the formation of the multiphase medium
is violent, and the mode of accretion is fully cold and chaotic. The recurrent
collisions and tidal forces between clouds, filaments and the central clumpy
torus promote angular momentum cancellation, hence boosting accretion. On
sub-pc scales the clouds are channelled to the very centre via a funnel. A good
approximation to the accretion rate is the cooling rate, which can be used as
subgrid model, physically reproducing the boost factor of 100 required by
cosmological simulations, while accounting for fluctuations. Chaotic cold
accretion may be common in many systems, such as hot galactic halos, groups,
and clusters, generating high-velocity clouds and strong variations of the AGN
luminosity and jet orientation. In this mode, the black hole can quickly react
to the state of the entire host galaxy, leading to efficient self-regulated AGN
feedback and the symbiotic Magorrian relation. During phases of overheating,
the hot mode becomes the single channel of accretion (with a different cuspy
temperature profile), though strongly suppressed by turbulence.

to retain their integrity as satellite galaxies when they merge to form larger
entities. Although many dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are found in the
galactic halo around the Milky Way, their phase space density (or velocity
dispersion) appears to be significantly smaller than that expected for
satellite dwarf galaxies in the LambdaCDM scenario. In order to account for
this discrepancy, we consider the possibility that they may have lost a
significant fraction of their baryonic matter content during the first infall
at the Hubble expansion turnaround. Such mass loss arises naturally due to the
feedback by relatively massive stars which formed in their centers briefly
before the maximum contraction. Through a series of N-body simulations, we show
that the timely loss of a significant fraction of the dSphs initial baryonic

channel to distribute a shared secret string to two distant users. However,
protocols exploiting a two-way quantum channel have been proposed as an
alternative route to the same goal, with the potential advantage of
outperforming one-way protocols. Here we provide a strategy to prove security
for two-way quantum key distribution protocols against the most general quantum
attack possible by an eavesdropper. We utilize an entropic uncertainty
relation, and only a few assumptions need to be made about the devices used in
the protocol. We also show that a two-way protocol can outperform comparable
one-way protocols.

The resulting dynamical masses range from 1e9 to 1e10 solar masses. We also fit
stellar population models to our sample, and use them to plot the Lyman alpha
sample on a stellar mass vs. line width relation. Overall, the Lyman alpha
galaxies follow well the scaling relation established by observing star forming
galaxies at lower redshift (and without regard for Lyman alpha emission),
though in 1/3 of the Lyman alpha galaxies, lower-mass fits are also acceptable.
In all cases, the dynamical masses agree with established stellarmass-linewidth
relation. Using the dynamical masses as an upper limit on gas mass, we show
that Lyman alpha galaxies resemble starbursts (rather than ""normal"" galaxies)
in the relation between gas mass surface density and star formation activity,
in spite of relatively modest star formation rates. Finally, we examine the
mass densities of these galaxies, and show that their future evolution likely
requires dissipational (""wet"") merging. In short, we find that Lyman alpha
galaxies are low mass cousins of larger starbursts.

1-m Solar Telescope to identify the location and spatio-temporal properties of
heating in the magnetic chromosphere. In particular, we report the existence of
raised-core spectral line profiles in the Ca II 8542 line. These profiles are
characterized by the absence of an absorption line core, showing a quasi-flat
profile between +/- 0.5 {\AA}, and are abundant close to magnetic bright-points
and plage. Comparison with 3D MHD simulations indicates that such profiles
occur when the line-of-sight goes through an ""elevated temperature canopy""
associated with the expansion with height of the magnetic field of flux
concentrations. This temperature canopy in the simulations is caused by ohmic
dissipation where there are strong magnetic field gradients. The raised-core
profiles are thus indicators of locations of increased chromospheric heating.
We characterize the location and temporal and spatial properties of such
profiles in our observations, thus providing much stricter constraints on

with a very large dispersion). In fact, we find that all matter has a higher
spin parameter when measured at accretion than when averaged over the entire
halo lifetime, and is well characterized by \lambda~0.1, at accretion. Combined
with the fact that cold flow gas spends a relatively short time (1-2 dynamical
times) in the halo before sinking to the center, this naturally explains why
cold flow halo gas has a specific angular momentum much higher than that of the

momentum of cold flow gas is related to the fact that it tends to be accreted
along filaments.

observations of ultraviolet spectra of 44 hot subdwarf stars a few hundred pc
away from the Sun, we can compare column densities of Ar I to those of O I,

favor an explanation that bursts of radiation created by previous, nearby

that the low energy portion of the soft X ray background is poorly shielded by

planetary evolution remains largely unstudied. Unlike their tighter
counterparts, the stellar orbits of wide binaries continually change under the
influence of the Galactic tide and impulses from other passing stars. Here we
report numerical simulations demonstrating that the variable nature of wide
binary star orbits dramatically reshapes the planetary systems they host,
typically Gyrs after formation. Contrary to previous understanding, wide binary
companions may often strongly perturb planetary systems, triggering planetary
ejections and exciting orbital eccentricities of surviving planets. Indeed,
observed exoplanet eccentricities offer evidence of this; giant exoplanet
orbits within wide binaries are statistically more eccentric than those around
isolated stars. Both eccentricity distributions are well-reproduced when we
assume isolated stars and wide binaries host similar planetary systems whose
outermost giant planets are scattered beyond ~10 AU from their parent stars via
early internal instabilities. Consequently, our results suggest that although
wide binaries eventually truncate their planetary systems, most isolated giant
exoplanet systems harbor additional distant, still undetected planets.

classification; we refine z=0.10853 based on [O III]. We estimate a BH
mass=10^9 Msun using 2 independent methods (H-beta line width & SED fits).
Blue-shifted absorption (-950km/s & -75km/s) is seen for the 1st time in STIS
UV spectra from Ly-alpha, NV, & CIV. The higher velocity UV lines are
coincident with the lower-ionisation (xi~1.6) X-ray warm absorber lines. A
dusty multiple ionization absorber blueshifted by 700-900km/s is required to
fit the X-ray data. Theoretical models comparing different ionising SEDs reveal
that a UV-inclusive (i.e., the accretion disc) ionising continuum strongly
impacts conclusions for the thermodynamic stability of the warm absorber.
Specific to IRAS13349, an Xray-UV ionising SED favors a continuous distribution
of ionisation states in a smooth flow (this paper), versus discrete clouds in
pressure equilibrium (work by others where UV is omitted). Direct dust
detections are seen in both the IR: PAH emission at (7.7 & 11.3)micron which
may also be blended with forsterite, and (10 & 18)micron silicate emission, and
X-rays: iron dust with a dust-to-gas ratio > 90%. We develop a geometrical
model whereby the QSO nuclear region is viewed through the upper atmosphere of
an obscuring torus. This sight line is obscured by dust that blocks a direct
view of the UV/optical emission region but is largely transparent in X-rays
since the gas is ionised. In our model, 20% of the intrinsic UV/optical
continuum is scattered into our sight line by the far wall of an obscuring
torus. An additional 2.4% of the direct light, which likely dominates the UV
emission, is Thomson-scattered into our line-of-sight by another off-plane

this is not the case for more complex scenarios, like the ""bouncing"" cDE model,

intervals of about 10^4 yr, most likely between 5000 and 50000 yr. This is
consistent with the dynamical timescales for outflows, but not with the
separations of emission knots in outflows, indicating that episodic accretion

measure the dust and molecular gas emission from galaxies that have
luminosities lower than the Milky Way, out to high redshifts and with
unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity. This will provide new
constraints on the star formation properties and gas reservoir in galaxies
throughout cosmic times through dedicated deep field campaigns targeting the
CO/[CII] lines and dust continuum emission. In this paper, we present empirical
predictions for such (sub-)millimeter line and continuum deep fields. We base
these predictions on the deepest available optical/near-infrared ACS and NICMOS
data on the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. Using a physically-motivated spectral
energy distribution model, we fit the observed optical/near-infrared emission
of 13,099 galaxies with redshifts up to z=5, and obtain median likelihood
estimates of their stellar mass, star formation rate, dust attenuation and dust
luminosity. We derive statistical constraints on the dust emission in the
infrared and (sub-)millimeter which are consistent with the observed
optical/near-infrared emission in terms of energy balance. This allows us to
estimate, for each galaxy, the (sub-)millimeter continuum flux densities in
several ALMA, PdBI/NOEMA and JVLA bands. Using empirical relations between the
observed CO/[CII] line luminosities and the infrared luminosity, we infer the
flux of the CO(1-0) and [CII] lines from the estimated infrared luminosity of
each galaxy in our sample. We then predict the fluxes of higher CO transition
lines CO(2-1) to CO(7-6) bracketing two extreme gas excitation scenarios. We
use our predictions to discuss possible deep field strategies with ALMA. The
predictions presented in this study will serve as a direct benchmark for future

likelihood, Z, from a Markov chain simulation of the posterior distribution.
Its key point is: the choice of an integration subdomain that eliminates
subvolumes with poor sampling owing to low tail-values of posterior
probability. Conversely, this same idea may be used to choose the subdomain
that optimizes the accuracy of Z. Here, we explore using the simulated
distribution to define a small region of high posterior probability, followed
by a numerical integration of the sample in the selected region using the
volume tessellation algorithm described in Weinberg (2012). Even more promising
is the resampling of this small region followed by a naive Monte Carlo
integration. The new enhanced algorithm is computationally trivial and leads to
a dramatic improvement in accuracy. For example, this application of the new
algorithm to a four-component mixture with random locations in 16 dimensions
yields accurate evaluation of Z with 5% errors. This enables Bayes-factor model
selection for real-world problems that have been infeasible with previous

sample of 220000 galaxies selected using the UltraVISTA DR1 data release. Our
analysis is based on precise 30-band photometric redshifts. By comparing these
photometric redshifts with 10800 spectroscopic redshifts from the zCOSMOS
bright and faint surveys, we find a precision of sigma(dz/(1+z))=0.008 at
i<22.5 and sigma(dz/(1+zs))=0.03 at 1.5<z<4. We derive the stellar mass
function and correct for the Eddington bias. We find a mass-dependent evolution
of the global and star-forming populations. This mass-dependent evolution is a
direct consequence of the star formation being quenched in galaxies more
massive than M>10^10.7Msun. For the mass function of the quiescent galaxies, we
do not find any significant evolution of the high-mass end at z<1; however we
observe a clear flattening of the faint-end slope. From z~3 to z~1, the density
of quiescent galaxies increases over the entire mass range. Their comoving
stellar mass density increases by 1.6 dex between z~3 and z~1 and by less than
0.2dex at z<1. We infer the star formation history from the mass density
evolution and we find an excellent agreement with instantaneous star formation
rate measurements at z<1.5, while we find differences of 0.2dex at z>1.5
consistent with the expected uncertainties. We also develop a new method to
infer the specific star formation rate from the mass function of star-forming
galaxies. We find that the specific star formation rate of 10^10Msun galaxies
increases continuously in the redshift range 1<z<4. Finally, we compare our
results with a semi-analytical model and find that these models overestimate
the density of low mass quiescent galaxies by an order of magnitude, while the

remains mysterious. It has long been suggested that the entanglement entropy of
quantum fields on the black hole gravitational background should represent at
least an important contribution to the total Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and
that the divergences in the entanglement entropy should be absorbed in the
renormalization of the gravitational couplings. In this talk, we describe how
an improved understanding of black hole entropy is obtained by combining these
notions with the renormalization group. By introducing an RG flow scale, we
investigate whether the total entropy of the black hole can be partitioned in a

show that its sign on C[x,y] (i.e. whether it is negative or non-positive on
non-constant polynomials) is completely determined by the sign of its value on
the 'last key form' (key forms being the avatar of 'key polynomials' of
valuations (introduced by [Maclane, 1936]) in 'global coordinates'). The proof
involves computations related to the cone of curves on certain
compactifications of C^2 and gives a characterization of the divisorial
valuations centered at infinity whose 'skewness' can be interpreted in terms of
the 'slope' of an extremal ray of these cones, yielding a generalization of a
result of [Favre-Jonsson, 2007]. A by-product of these arguments is a
characterization of valuations which 'determine' normal compactifications of
C^2 with one irreducible curve at infinity in terms of an associated 'semigroup
of values'.

self-generated hydromagnetic waves in a cosmic-ray pressure dominated plasma is
considered. Using a three-dimensional hybrid MHD-kinetic code, which utilises a
spherical harmonic expansion of the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation, high
resolution simulations of the magnetic field growth including feedback on the
cosmic rays are carried out. It is found that for shocks with high cosmic-ray
acceleration efficiency, the magnetic fields become highly disorganised,
resulting in near isotropic diffusion, independent of the initial orientation
of the ambient magnetic field. The possibility of sub-Bohm diffusion is
demonstrated for parallel shocks, while the diffusion coefficient approaches
the Bohm limit from below for oblique shocks. This universal behaviour suggests
that Bohm diffusion in the root mean squared field inferred from observation
may provide a realistic estimate for the maximum energy acceleration timescale
in young supernova remnants. Although disordered, the magnetic field is not
self-similar suggesting non-uniform energy dependent behaviour of the energetic
particle transport in the precursor. Possible indirect radiative signatures of
cosmic-ray driven magnetic field amplification are discussed.

  Technology",,,,"cs.IT cs.MM math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The structured nature of video data motivates introducing video-aware
decisions that make use of this structure for improved video transmission over
wireless networks. In this paper, we introduce an architecture for real-time
video transmission over multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless
communication systems using loss visibility side information. We quantify the
perceptual importance of a packet through the packet loss visibility and use
the loss visibility distribution to provide a notion of relative packet
importance. To jointly achieve video quality and low latency, we define the
optimization objective function as the throughput weighted by the loss
visibility of each packet, a proxy for the total perceptual value of successful
packets per unit time. We solve the problem of mapping video packets to MIMO
subchannels and adapting per-stream rates to maximize the proposed objective.
We show that the solution enables jointly reaping gains in terms of improved
video quality and lower latency. Optimized packet-stream mapping enables
transmission of more relevant packets over more reliable streams while unequal
modulation opportunistically increases the transmission rate on the stronger
streams to enable low latency delivery of high priority packets. We extend the
solution to capture codebook-based limited feedback and MIMO mode adaptation.
Results show that the composite quality and throughput gains are significant
under full channel state information as well as limited feedback. Tested on
H.264-encoded video sequences, for a 4x4 MIMO with 3 spatial streams, the
proposed architecture achieves 8 dB power reduction for the same video quality
and supports 2.4x higher throughput due to unequal modulation. Furthermore, the
gains are achieved at the expense of few bits of cross-layer overhead rather
than a complex cross-layer design.

FP, indicating (under the assumption of passive evolution) the formation
redshift, z_form, depends on the galaxy velocity dispersion (or mass). z_form
varies from z_form=1.24+-0.05 at velocity dispersion of 125 km/s to 1.95+-0.25

low enough that the disk's self-gravity can be neglected. However, disk
instability requires a disk massive enough to be marginally gravitationally
unstable (MGU). Even for core accretion, a FU Orionis outburst may require a
brief MGU disk phase. We present a new set of three dimensional, gravitational
radiation hydrodynamics models of MGU disks with multiple protoplanets, which
interact gravitationally with the disk and with each other, including disk gas
mass accretion. Initial protoplanet masses are 0.01 to 10 $M_\oplus$ for core
accretion models, and 0.1 to 3 $M_{Jup}$ for Nice scenario models, starting on
circular orbits with radii of 6, 8, 10, or 12 AU, inside a 0.091 $M_\odot$ disk
extending from 4 to 20 AU around a $1 M_\odot$ protostar. Evolutions are

disks does not occur. A system with giant planet masses similar to our Solar
System (1.0, 0.33, 0.1, 0.1 $M_{Jup}$) was stable for over 1000 yr, and a

CAFein computes the non-adiabatic eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of
detailed stellar models. The code is based on the so-called Riccati method, a
numerical algorithm that has been successfully applied to a variety of stellar
pulsators, and which doesn't suffer of the major drawbacks of commonly used
shooting and relaxation schemes. Here we present an extension of the Riccati

Finally, we verify CAFein's behavior in the dynamic tides regime by
investigating the effects of dynamic tides on the eigenfunctions and orbital

hot Jupiter host stars. The plethora of asteroseismic data provided by the
NASA's Kepler satellite, some of which include the direct detection of tidally

high level of enrichment measured in the intracluster medium (ICM); however,

that the stars in the generally old population studied optically in cluster
galaxies emerged from the same formation sites at the same epochs. We construct
a phenomenological cluster enrichment model to demonstrate that ICM elemental
abundances are underestimated by a factor >2 for standard assumptions about the
stellar population -- a discrepancy we term the ""cluster elemental abundance
paradox"". Recent evidence of an elliptical galaxy IMF skewed to low masses
deepens the paradox. We quantify the adjustments to the star formation
efficiency and initial mass function (IMF), and SNIa production efficiency,
required to resolve this while being consistent with the observed ICM abundance
pattern. The necessary enhancement in metal enrichment may, in principle,
originate in the observed stellar population if a larger fraction of stars in
the supernova-progenitor mass range form from an initial mass function (IMF)
that is either bottom-light or top-heavy, with the latter in some conflict with
observed ICM abundance ratios. Other alternatives that imply more modest
revisions to the IMF, mass return and remnant fractions, and primordial
fraction, posit an increase in the fraction of 3-8 solar mass stars that
explode as SNIa or assume that there are more stars than conventionally thought
-- although the latter implies a high star formation efficiency. We discuss the
feasibility of these various solutions and the implications for the diversity
of star formation in the universe, the process of elliptical galaxy formation,

coefficients occur in application domains such as diffusions through porous

processes on rough surfaces. The standard approach to numerically treating such
problems using finite element methods is to assume that the discontinuities lie
on the boundaries of the cells in the initial triangulation. However, this does
not match applications where discontinuities occur on curves, surfaces, or
manifolds, and could even be unknown beforehand. One of the obstacles to
treating such discontinuity problems is that the usual perturbation theory for
elliptic PDEs assumes bounds for the distortion of the coefficients in the
$L_\infty$ norm and this in turn requires that the discontinuities are matched
exactly when the coefficients are approximated. We present a new approach based
on distortion of the coefficients in an $L_q$ norm with $q<\infty$ which
therefore does not require the exact matching of the discontinuities. We then
use this new distortion theory to formulate new adaptive finite element methods
(AFEMs) for such discontinuity problems. We show that such AFEMs are optimal in
the sense of distortion versus number of computations, and report insightful
numerical results supporting our analysis.

radial migration models. In theory, torque exchange between these moons and
ring particles leads to radial drift. We predict that moons with Hill radii r_H
~ 2-24 km should migrate through the A ring in 1000 yr. In this size range,
moons orbiting in an empty gap or in a full ring eventually migrate at the same
rate. Smaller moons or moonlets -- such as the propellers (e.g., Tiscareno et
al. 2006) -- are trapped by diffusion of disk material into corotating orbits,
creating inertial drag. Larger moons -- such as Pan or Atlas -- do not migrate
because of their own inertia. Fast migration of 2-24 km moons should eliminate
intermediate-size bodies from the A ring and may be responsible for the
observed large-radius cutoff of r_H ~ 1-2 km in the size distribution of the A
ring's propeller moonlets. Although the presence of Daphnis (r_H ~ 5 km) inside
the Keeler gap challenges this scenario, numerical simulations demonstrate that
orbital resonances and stirring by distant, larger moons (e.g., Mimas) may be
important factors. For Daphnis, stirring by distant moons seems the most
promising mechanism to halt fast migration. Alternatively, Daphnis may be a
recent addition to the ring that is settling into a low inclination orbit in
~10^3 yr prior to a phase of rapid migration. We provide predictions of

vector is encoded into a transformed codeword in the transform domain. Then,
the transmitted codeword is obtained from the transformed codeword by the
inverse Galois Fourier transform. For binary QC codes, a simple and fast
mapping is required to post-process the transformed codeword such that the
transmitted codeword is binary as well. The complexity of our proposed encoding
algorithm is O[e(n-k)k] symbol operations for non-binary codes and
O[ek(n-k)(log_2 e)] bit operations for binary codes. These complexities are
much lower than their traditional counterpart O[(e^2)(n-k)k]. For example, our
complexity of encoding a 64-ary (4095,2160) QC code is only 1.59% of that of
traditional encoding, and our complexities of encoding the binary (4095, 2160)

agreement algorithms designed by Ben-Or and Bracha to tolerate crash or

\emph{inherent}: we prove that any algorithm with essentially perfect

exponential running time. We additionally interpret this result as yielding an
enhanced understanding of the tools needed to simultaneously achieving perfect
correctness and termination as well as fast running time for randomized

convex programming, we demonstrate that quantum gate transformations can be
made substantially robust against uncertainties while simultaneously using
limited resources of control amplitude and bandwidth. Achieving such a high
degree of robustness requires a quantitative model that specifies the range and
character of the uncertainties. Using a model of a controlled one-qubit system
for illustrative simulations, we identify robust control fields for a universal
gate set and explore the tradeoff between the worst-case gate fidelity and the
field fluence. Our results demonstrate that, even for this simple model, there
exist a rich variety of control design possibilities. In addition, we study the
effect of noise represented by a stochastic uncertainty model.

constrained $l_1$-analysis, called analysis Dantzig selector, stably recovers a
signal which is nearly sparse in terms of a tight frame provided that the
measurement matrix satisfies a restricted isometry property adapted to the
tight frame. As a special case, we consider the Gaussian noise. Further, under
a sparsity scenario, with high probability, the recovery error from noisy data
is within a log-like factor of the minimax risk over the class of vectors which
are at most $s$ sparse in terms of the tight frame. Similar results for the
analysis LASSO are showed.
  The above two algorithms provide guarantees only for noise that is bounded or
bounded with high probability (for example, Gaussian noise). However, when the
underlying measurements are corrupted by sparse noise, these algorithms perform
suboptimally. We demonstrate robust methods for reconstructing signals that are
nearly sparse in terms of a tight frame in the presence of bounded noise
combined with sparse noise. The analysis in this paper is based on the
restricted isometry property adapted to a tight frame, which is a natural
extension to the standard restricted isometry property.

pairwise distances of an arbitrary metric. This problem is closely related to
low-stretch metric embeddings and is interesting by its own flavor from the
line of research proposed in the literature.
  As the structure of a tree imposes great constraints on the pairwise
distances, any embedding of a metric into a tree metric is known to have
maximum pairwise stretch of $\Omega(\log n)$. We show, however, from the
perspective of average performance, there exist tree metrics which preserve the
sum of pairwise distances of the given metric up to a small constant factor,
for which we also show to be no worse than twice what we can possibly expect.
The approach we use to tackle this problem is more direct compared to a
previous result of [4], and also leads to a provably better guarantee. Second,
when the given metric is extracted from a Euclidean point set of finite
dimension $d$, we show that there exist spanning trees of the given point set
such that the sum of pairwise distances is preserved up to a constant which
depends only on $d$. Both of our proofs are constructive. The main ingredient
in our result is a special point-set decomposition which relates two

consistently the second order terms in isospin asymmetry in both the optical

strength of the second-order symmetry potential $U_{sym,2}$ in asymmetric
nuclear matter is significant compared to the first-order one U_{sym,1}$,
especially at high nucleon momentum. While the $U_{sym,1}$ at normal density
decreases with nucleon momentum, the $U_{sym,2}$ is found to have the opposite

ITER operation. Optimizing ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH) in such
scenarios will help in achieving H-mode in these plasmas. Past JET experiments
with the carbon wall revealed a significant impact of intrinsic impurities on
the ICRH performance in (3He)-H plasmas relevant for the full-field initial
ITER phase. High plasma contamination with carbon impurities resulted in the
appearance of a supplementary mode conversion layer and significant reduction
in the transition concentration of 3He minority ions, defined as the
concentration at which the change from minority heating to mode conversion
regime occurs. In view of the installation of the new ITER-like wall at JET, it
is important to evaluate the effect of Be and W impurities on ICRH scenarios in
(3He)-H plasmas. In this paper, an approximate analytical expression for the
transition concentration of 3He minority ions is derived as a function of
plasma and ICRH parameters, and accounting for typical impurity species at JET.
The accompanying 1D wave modeling supports the analytical results and suggests
a potential experimental method to reduce 3He level needed to achieve a
specific heating regime by puffing a small amount of 4He ions additionally to
(3He)-H plasma.

explicitly in terms of prior probabilities for and conditional probabilities
consequent upon the imagined outcomes of a special counterfactual reference

systems. This means that the system has to decide which tasks are more suitable
for hardware execution. In order to make an efficient use of the FPGA it is
convenient to choose one that allows hardware multitasking, which is
implemented by using partial dynamic reconfiguration. One of the challenges for
hardware multitasking in embedded systems is the online management of the only
reconfiguration port of present FPGA devices. This paper presents different
online reconfiguration scheduling strategies which assign the reconfiguration
interface resource using different criteria: workload distribution or task
deadline. The online scheduling strategies presented take efficient and fast
decisions based on the information available at each moment. Experiments have
been made in order to analyze the performance and convenience of these
reconfiguration strategies.

on a network of 2d percolation clusters. Sufficiently close to the percolation
threshold, this network has a broad degree distribution, and at p=p_c the
degree distribution becomes scale-free. We study the Transverse Ising Model on
this complex topology in order to characterize the superconductor-insulator
transition in a network formed by 2d percolation clusters of a superconductor
material. We show, by a mean-field treatment, that the critical temperature of
superconductivity depends on the maximal eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of
the network. At the percolation threshold, we find that the maximal eigenvalue
of the adjacency matrix of the network of 2d percolation clusters has a
maximum. In correspondence of this maximum the superconducting critical
temperature T_c is enhanced. These results suggest the design of new
superconducting granular materials with enhanced critical temperature.

long-standing debate regarding the nature of the active surface. The pristine
metallic surface, an ultra-thin (sqrt5xsqrt5)R27^o PdO(101) surface oxide, and
thicker oxide layers have each been suggested as the active state. We
investigate these hypotheses with 1p-kMC simulations focusing on either the

of (T, p)-conditions where both terminations appear metastable. The predicted
bistability regime nicely ties in with oscillatory behavior reported
experimentally by Hendriksen and coworkers [Catal. Today 105, 234 (2005)].
Within this regime we find that both surface terminations exhibit very similar

attention owing to their potential applications to nonvolatile memories and
multi-functional devices. As for the size effect of 180o stripe domains in
ferroelectric thin films, there have been extensive reports on the
thickness-dependent domain periodicity. All these studies have revealed that
the domain periodicity of 180o stripe domains scales with the film thickness
(d) according to the classical Landau-Lifshitz-Kittel (LLK) scaling law down to
the thickness of ~2 nm. In the case of PbTiO3 nanodots, however, we obtained a
quite striking correlation that for the thickness less than a certain critical
value, dc (~35 nm), the domain width even increases with decreasing thickness
of the nanodot, which surprisingly indicates a negative value in the LLK
scaling-law exponent. On the basis of theoretical considerations of dc, we
attribute this anomalous domain periodicity to the presence of a
nonferroelectric surface layer, in addition to the finite lateral-size effect
of a ferroelectric nanodot.

extend the underlying method, a renormalized superperturbation theory on the
Keldysh contour, to the thermal conductance in the nonlinear regime. We
determine the charge, energy, and heat current through the nanostructure and
study the nonlinear transport coefficients, the entropy production, and the
fate of the Wiedemann-Franz law in the non-thermal steady-state. Our approach
is based on a renormalized perturbation theory in terms of dual fermions around

constraint. For this reason, they are often neglected as a possible source of
important functional variation. We use site frequency spectra from deep
population sequencing data to show that, contrary to this expectation, 22% of
four-fold synonymous (4D) sites in D. melanogaster evolve under very strong
selective constraint while few, if any, appear to be under weak constraint.
Linking polymorphism with divergence data, we further find that the fraction of
synonymous sites exposed to strong purifying selection is higher for those
positions that show slower evolution on the Drosophila phylogeny. The function
underlying the inferred strong constraint appears to be separate from splicing
enhancers, nucleosome positioning, and the translational optimization
generating canonical codon bias. The fraction of synonymous sites under strong
constraint within a gene correlates well with gene expression, particularly in
the mid-late embryo, pupae, and adult developmental stages. Genes enriched in
strongly constrained synonymous sites tend to be particularly functionally
important and are often involved in key developmental pathways. Given that the
observed widespread constraint acting on synonymous sites is likely not limited
to Drosophila, the role of synonymous sites in genetic disease and adaptation
should be reevaluated.

quantum dots in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field containing p-n,
as well as p-n-p and n-p-n junctions. The results show the interplay between
the edge states associated with the zigzag terminations of the sample and the
snake states that arise at the p-n junction, due to the overlap between
electron and hole states at the potential interface. Remarkable localized
states are found at the crossing of the p-n junction with the zigzag edge
having a dumb-bell shaped electron distribution. The results are presented as
function of the junction parameters and the applied magnetic flux.

In linear response the changes in the thermoelectric properties can be traced
back to the interaction induced renormalization of the resonance line shape. In
particular, small to intermediate repulsive interactions reduce the maximum
efficiency. In nonequilibrium the situation is more complex and we identify a
parameter regime in which for a fixed lower bound of the output power the

the Neuberger zero problem of the standard Fadeev-Popov construction. The
proposed gauge fixing can be formulated as a local renormalizable field theory

feature is that, for what concerns the calculation of ghost and gauge field
correlators, the gauged-fixed action is perturbatively equivalent to a simple
massive extension of the Faddeev-Popov action. The renormalization group flow

which creates M-ary data by means of the position of a pulse within a time

this type of modulation is vulnerable to loss of synchronization, potentially
causing a severe error floor or throughput penalty even when little or no noise
is assumed. Another disadvantage is that this type of modulation typically
offers no error correction mechanism on its own, making them sensitive to
intersymbol interference and environmental noise. In this paper we propose a
coding theoretic variation of PPM that allows for significantly more efficient
symbol and frame synchronization as well as strong error correction. The
proposed scheme can be divided into a synchronization layer and a modulation
layer. This makes our technique compatible with major existing techniques such
as standard PPM, multipluse PPM, and expurgated PPM as well in that the scheme
can be realized by adding a simple synchronization layer to one of these
standard techniques. We also develop a generalization of expurgated PPM suited
for the modulation layer of the proposed self-synchronizing modulation scheme.
This generalized PPM can also be used as stand-alone error-correcting PPM with

dictionary learning algorithm that has gained significant popularity in

dictionary $\Phi\in \mathbb{R}^{d \times K}$ can be recovered as local minimum
of the minimisation criterion underlying K-SVD from a set of $N$ training
signals $y_n =\Phi x_n$. A theoretical analysis of the problem leads to two
types of identifiability results assuming the training signals are generated
from a tight frame with coefficients drawn from a random symmetric
distribution. First, asymptotic results showing, that in expectation the
generating dictionary can be recovered exactly as a local minimum of the K-SVD
criterion if the coefficient distribution exhibits sufficient decay. Second,
based on the asymptotic results it is demonstrated that given a finite number
of training samples $N$, such that $N/\log N = O(K^3d)$, except with
probability $O(N^{-Kd})$ there is a local minimum of the K-SVD criterion within
distance $O(KN^{-1/4})$ to the generating dictionary.

cyclotron line, the photon index and the flux of the 6.4 keV iron line, we have
studied the variation as a function of 35 d phase. We analyzed RXTE
observations of the Main-On of November 2002. Four different time intervals of
about 1 d duration were selected to provide a good coverage of a complete
Main-On. The intervals are centered at 35 d phase 0.03, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20,
respectively. All spectral parameters show a strong modulation with pulse
phase. While the centroid energy of the cyclotron line follows roughly the
shape of the pulse profile, both the photon index and the iron line intensity
exhibit distinct minima around the peak of the X-ray pulse. With respect to
variations of the observed profiles with 35 d phase, we find that there is a
clear evolution of the shape of the pulse profiles (flux versus pulse phase), a
moderate increase of the maximum cyclotron line energy (found around pulse
phase 0.7), but no significant evolution of the shape of the pulse phase
profiles of the cyclotron line energy, the spectral power law index or the iron
line intensity. The variation of spectral parameters as a function of the pulse
phase provides important information about the system: 1. the disappearance of
the Fe line flux near the highest continuum flux may be an indication of a
hollow cone geometry of the accretion structure; ii. the apparent
non-dependence of the cyclotron line energy profiles on 35 d phase provides a
new possibility to test the model of free precession of the neutron star,
proposed to be responsible for the systematic variations in the pulse profiles.

detected through ground-based secondary eclipse observations in the

energy budgets of hot Jupiters, since they probe the planet's spectral energy
distribution near its peak. The aim of this work is to measure the Ks-band
secondary eclipse depth of WASP-33b, the first planet discovered to transit an
A-type star. This planet receives the highest level of irradiation of all
transiting planets discovered to date. Furthermore, its host-star shows
pulsations and is classified as a low-amplitude delta-Scuti. As part of our
GROUnd-based Secondary Eclipse (GROUSE) project we have obtained observations
of two separate secondary eclipses of WASP-33b in the Ks-band using the LIRIS
instrument on the William Herschel Telescope (WHT). The telescope was
significantly defocused to avoid saturation of the detector for this bright
star (K~7.5). To increase the stability and the cadence of the observations,
they were performed in staring mode. We collected a total of 5100 and 6900
frames for the first and the second night respectively, both with an average
cadence of 3.3 seconds. On the second night the eclipse is detected at the
12-sigma level, with a measured eclipse depth of 0.244+0.027-0.020 %. This
eclipse depth corresponds to a brightness temperature of 3270+115-160 K. The
measured brightness temperature on the second night is consistent with the
expected equilibrium temperature for a planet with a very low albedo and a
rapid re-radiation of the absorbed stellar light. For the other night the short
out-of-eclipse baseline prevents good corrections for the stellar pulsations
and systematic effects, which makes this dataset unreliable for eclipse depth
measurements. This demonstrates the need of getting a sufficient out-of-eclipse
baseline.

from their high-quality ACS data in the F435W, F555W and F814W filters, and
updated sets of stellar evolutionary tracks, we derive their star formation
rates as a function of age, SFR(t), by means of the classical method of CMD
reconstruction which is usually applied to nearby galaxies. The method confirms
the extended periods of star formation derived from previous analysis of the
same data. When the analysis is performed for a finer resolution in age, we
find clear evidence for a 50-Myr long hiatus between the oldest peak in the
SFR(t), and a second prolonged period of star formation, in both clusters. For
the more compact cluster NGC1846, there seems to be no significant difference
between the SFR(t) in the cluster centre and in an annulus with radii between
20 and 60 arcsec (from 4.8 to 15.4 pc). The same does not occur in the more
extended NGC1783 cluster, where the outer ring (between 33 and 107 arcsec, from
8.0 to 25.9 pc) is found to be slightly younger than the centre. We also
explore the best-fitting slope of the present-day mass function and binary
fraction for the different cluster regions, finding hints of a varying mass
function between centre and outer ring in NGC1783. These findings are discussed
within the present scenarios for the formation of clusters with multiple
turn-offs.

classified into four regimes with qualitatively different statistical
properties. First, there are transients that depend on the initial conditions.
In the second regime, power-law scaling regions, in the energy and the
occupation-number spectra, appear and start to develop; the exponents of these
power-laws and the extents of the scaling regions change with time and depended
on the initial condition. In the third regime, the spectra drop rapidly for
modes with wave numbers $k > k_c$ and partial thermalization takes place for
modes with $k < k_c$; the self-truncation wave number $k_c(t)$ depends on the
initial conditions and it grows either as a power of $t$ or as $\log t$.
Finally, in the fourth regime, complete-thermalization is achieved and, if we
account for finite-size effects carefully, correlation functions and spectra
are consistent with their nontrivial Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless forms.

an observational campaign of 9 days, deriving more than 70000 heliometric
images of the Sun. The measured solar diameter has a standard deviation of 0.5
arcseconds, with no instrumental bias, and limited only by the provisional
atmospheric modeling. Therefore, by improving the statistics, an accuracy at
milliarcseconds can be achieved. A study of the correlation between the solar
diameter and the geomagnetic field intensity was made. A correspondence between
the peaks of the series related to solar activity, namely, the semidiameter
variation, the flares index, and the sunspots counts, and the number of
negative peaks on the intensity of the geomagnetic field is found. It must be
cautioned though that it is a complex correspondence, requiring different modes
of response and phase dependence on the stage of the cycle of solar activity.
The straightforward interpretation of observational evidence indicates that the
semidiameter of the Sun seems to vary significantly prior to the corresponding
variations of the geomagnetic field. The effect is most evident in the downward
phase of the solar cycle.

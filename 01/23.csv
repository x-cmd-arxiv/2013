for the off-shell decays in $H \to (W,Z) + (W^\ast,Z^\ast) (\to q_1\bar q_2)$
it is important to keep the masses of the charm and bottom quarks at their
finite values since the scale of the problem is not set by $m_{W,Z}^2$ but by
the off-shellness of the gauge boson which varies in the range $(m_1+m_2)^2 \le

toroidal compactification of extra dimensions. To simulate the astrophysical
objects (e.g., our Sun and pulsars) with the energy density much greater than
the pressure, we suppose that these bodies are pressureless in the external/our
space. At the same time, they may have nonzero parameters \omega_{(\bar\alpha
-3)} \, (\bar\alpha =4,...,D) of the equations of state in the extra
dimensions. We construct the Lagrange function of this many-body system for any
value of \Sigma =\sum_{\bar\alpha} \omega_{(\bar\alpha -3)}. Moreover, the
gravitational tests (PPN parameters, perihelion/periastron advance) require
negligible deviation from the latent soliton value \Sigma =-(D-3)/2. However,
the presence of pressure/tension in the internal space results necessarily in
the smearing of the gravitating masses over the internal space and in the
absence of the KK modes. This looks very unnatural from the point of quantum
physics.

fulfills several classes of majorization relations, which govern the amount of
quantum entanglement that it can generate. First, we show that the state
resulting from k photons impinging on a beam splitter majorizes the
corresponding state with any larger photon number k'>k, implying that the
entanglement monotonically grows with k. Then, we examine parametric
infinitesimal majorization relations as a function of the beam-splitter
transmittance, and find that there exists a parameter region where majorization
is again fulfilled, implying a monotonic increase of entanglement by moving
towards a balanced beam splitter. We also identify regions with a majorization
default, where the output states become incomparable. In this latter situation,
we find examples where catalysis may nevertheless be used in order to recover
majorization. The catalyst states can be as simple as a path-entangled
single-photon state or a two-mode vacuum squeezed state.

are thought to be formed through fragmentation, but it is unclear when and how.
The youngest MPSs, which have not yet undergone much evolution, provide
important constraints to this question. It is then of interest to disentangle
early stage MPSs. In this letter we present the results of our work on VLA1623
using our observations and archival data from the Submillimeter Array (SMA).
Our continuum and line observations trace VLA1623's components, outflow and
envelope, revealing unexpected characteristics. We construct the SED for each
component using the results of our work and data from literature, as well as
derive physical parameters from continuum and perform a simple kinematical
analysis of the circumstellar material. Our results show VLA1623 to be a triple
non-coeval system composed of VLA1623A, B & W, with each source driving its own
outflow and unevenly distributed circumstellar material. From the SED, physical
parameters and IR emission we conclude that VLA1623A & W are Class 0 and I
protostars, respectively, and together drive the bulk of the observed outflow.
Furthermore, we find two surprising results, first the presence of a rotating
disk-like structure about VLA1623A with indications of pure Keplerian rotation,
which, if real, would make it one of the first evidence of Keplerian disk
structures around Class 0 protostars. Second, we find VLA1623B to be a bonafide
extremely young protostellar object between the starless core and Class 0
stages.

standards using an original technique adapted from the well-known Wheatstone
bridge. This work shows that the quantized Hall resistance at Landau level
filling factor $\nu=2$ can be reproducible with a relative uncertainty of
$32\times 10^{-12}$ in the dissipationless limit of the quantum Hall effect
regime. In the presence of a very small dissipation characterized by a mean
macroscopic longitudinal resistivity $\bar{R_{xx}(B)}$ of a few $\mu\Omega$,
the discrepancy $\Delta R_{\mathrm{H}}(B)$ measured on the Hall plateau between
quantum Hall resistors turns out to follow the so-called resistivity rule
$\bar{R_{xx}(B)}=\alpha B\times d(\Delta R_{\mathrm{H}}(B))/dB$. While the
dissipation increases with the measurement current value, the coefficient
$\alpha$ stays constant in the range investigated ($40-120 \mathrm{\mu A}$).
This result enlightens the impact of the dissipation emergence in the
two-dimensional electron gas on the Hall resistance quantization, which is of
major interest for the resistance metrology. The quantum Hall effect is used to
realize a universal resistance standard only linked to the electron charge
\emph{e} and the Planck's constant \emph{h} and it is known to play a central
role in the upcoming revised \emph{Syst\`eme International} of units. There are
therefore fundamental and practical benefits in testing the reproducibility
property of the quantum Hall effect with better and better accuracy.

is commonly modeled by multiple relaxations. For discrete relaxation
distributions, such models correspond with causal wave equations of
integer-order temporal derivatives. It has also been shown that certain
continuous distributions may give causal wave equations with fractional-order
temporal derivatives. This paper demonstrates analytically that if the
wave-frequency {\omega} satisfies \Omega_L << {\omega} << \Omega_H, a
continuous relaxation distribution populating only {\Omega} belongs to
[\Omega_L,\Omega_H] gives the same effective wave equation as for a fully
populated distribution. This insight sparks the main contribution: the
elaboration of a method to determine discrete relaxation parameters intended
for mimicking a desired attenuation behavior for band-limited waves. In
particular, power-law attenuation is discussed as motivated by its prevalence
in complex media, e.g. biological tissue. A Mittag-Leffler function related
distribution of relaxation mechanisms has previously been shown to be related
to the fractional Zener wave equation of three power-law attenuation regimes.
Because these regimes correspond to power-law regimes in the relaxation
distribution, the idea is to sample the distribution's compressibility
contributions evenly in logarithmic frequency while appropriately taking the
stepsize into account. This work thence claims to provide a model-based
approach to determination of discrete relaxation parameters intended to
adequately model attenuation power-laws.

a new extension of the classical Brunn-Minkowski theory. It represents a
generalization of the $L_p$-Brunn-Minkowski theory, analogous to the way that
Orlicz spaces generalize $L_p$ spaces. For appropriate convex functions
$\varphi:[0,\infty)^m\to [0,\infty)$, a new way of combining arbitrary sets in
$\R^n$ is introduced. This operation, called Orlicz addition and denoted by
$+_{\varphi}$, has several desirable properties, but is not associative unless
it reduces to $L_p$ addition. A general framework is introduced for the
Orlicz-Brunn-Minkowski theory that includes both the new addition and
previously introduced concepts, and makes clear for the first time the relation
to Orlicz spaces and norms. It is also shown that Orlicz addition is intimately
related to a natural and fundamental generalization of Minkowski addition
called $M$-addition. The results obtained show, roughly speaking, that the
Orlicz-Brunn-Minkowski theory is the most general possible based on an addition
that retains all the basic geometrical properties enjoyed by the
$L_p$-Brunn-Minkowski theory.
  Inequalities of the Brunn-Minkowski type are obtained, both for $M$-addition
and Orlicz addition. The new Orlicz-Brunn-Minkowski inequality implies the
$L_p$-Brunn-Minkowski inequality. New Orlicz-Minkowski inequalities are
obtained that generalize the $L_p$-Minkowski inequality. One of these has
connections with the conjectured log-Brunn-Minkowski inequality of Lutwak,
Yang, and Zhang, and in fact these two inequalities together are shown to split
the classical Brunn-Minkowski inequality.

proposed theory and of the Bogoliubov theory are identical if helium occupies a

These differences are due to the fact that the operator of the occupation
number of the zero momentum state does not commute with the creation and
annihilation operators of phonons. This contradicts the Bogoliubov assumption
that the creation and annihilation operators of atoms in the zero momentum
state can be replaced by a c-number. The latter, as is known, should commute
with any operator. This should lead to a difference in the results of

star formation (SF) model on the rest-frame UV luminosity function and star
formation rate function (SFRF) of z>=6 galaxies, and the implications for
reionization. Using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations outfitted with an
H_2-SF model, we find good agreement with our previous results (non-H_2 SF
model) and observations at Muv<=-18. However at Muv>-18, we find that the LF
deviates from both our previous work and current observational extrapolations,
producing significantly fewer low-luminosity galaxies and exhibiting additional
turnover at the faint end. We constrain the redshift evolution of this turnover
point using a modified Schechter function that includes additional terms to
quantify the turnover magnitude (Muv^t) and subsequent slope (Beta). We find
that Muv^t evolves from Muv^t=-17.33 (at z=8) to -15.38 (z=6), while Beta
becomes shallower by \Delta Beta=0.22 during the same epoch. This occurs in an
Muv range which will be observable by JWST. By integrating the SFRF, we
determine that even though H_2-SF model significantly reduces the number
density of low luminosity galaxies at Muv>-18, it does not suppress the total
SFR density enough to affect the capability of SF to maintain reionization.

compares a new set of different EDE parametrizations that reveal how CMB
constraints depend on the redshift epoch at which Dark Energy was non

starts to be non-negligible later, with early dark energy fraction Omega_e free
to go up to about 5% at 2 sigma if the onset of EDE happens at z < 100. Tight
bounds around 1-2% are obtained whenever dark energy is present at last
scattering, even if its effects switch off afterwards. We show that the CMB

physical properties of all these objects and their He, N, O, Ne, S and Ar
abundances in a consistent way.
  We find that, globally, compact HII regions have abundance ratios similar to
those of giant HII regions, while PNe have systematically larger N/O ratios and
similar Ne/O and Ar/O ratios. We demonstrate that the nitrogen enhancement in
PNe cannot be only due to second dredge-up in the progenitor stars, since their
initial masses are around 2--2.5\,\msun. An extra mixing process is required,
perhaps driven by stellar rotation.
  Concerning the radial abundance distribution, PNe behave differently from HII
regions: in the central part of the galaxy their average O/H abundance ratio is
0.15 dex smaller. Their abundance dispersion at any galactocentric radius is
significantly larger than that shown by HII regions and many of them have O/H
values higher than HII regions at the same galactocentric distance. This
suggests that not only nitrogen, but also oxygen is affected by nucleosynthesis
in the PN progenitors, by an amount which depends at least on the stellar
rotation velocity and possibly other parameters. The formal O/H, Ne/H and Ar/He
abundance gradients from PNe are significantly shallower that from HII regions.
We argue that this indicates a steepening of the metallicity gradient in NGC
300 during the last Gyr, rather than an effect of radial stellar motions,
although the large observed dispersion makes this conclusion only tentative.

with the hadronic decays $B^{0}_{s} \rightarrow D^{-}_{s}\pi^{+}$ and $B^0
\rightarrow D^{-}K^{+}$. The measurement uses data corresponding to 1.0
fb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV
recorded in the forward region with the LHCb experiment. The ratio of
production rates, $f_{s}/f_{d}$, is measured to be $0.238 \pm 0.004 \pm 0.015
\pm 0.021 $, where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second systematic,
and the third theoretical. This is combined with a previous LHCb measurement to
obtain $f_{s}/f_{d} = 0.256 \pm 0.020$. The dependence of $f_{s}/f_{d}$ on the
transverse momentum and pseudorapidity of the $B$ meson is determined using the
decays $B^{0}_{s} \rightarrow D^{-}_{s}\pi^{+}$ and $B^{0} \rightarrow
D^{-}\pi^{+}$. There is evidence for a decrease with increasing transverse
momentum, whereas the ratio remains constant as a function of pseudorapidity.
In addition, the ratio of branching fractions of the decays $B^{0} \rightarrow
D^{-}K^{+}$ and $B^{0} \rightarrow D^{-}\pi^{+}$ is measured to be $0.0822 \pm
0.0011 (\textrm{stat}) \pm 0.0025 (\textrm{syst})$.

estimator has a known statistical interpretation. Given the noisy measurements,
the RKHS estimate represents the posterior mean (minimum variance estimate) of
a Gaussian random field with covariance proportional to the kernel associated
with the RKHS. In this paper, we provide a statistical interpretation when more
general losses are used, such as absolute value, Vapnik or Huber. Specifically,
for any finite set of sampling locations (including where the data were
collected), the MAP estimate for the signal samples is given by the RKHS
estimate evaluated at these locations.

specified by membership oracles, and a continuous convex-concave function
$F:X\times Y\to\RR$, we consider the problem of computing an $\eps$-approximate
saddle point, that is, a pair $(x^*,y^*)\in X\times Y$ such that $\sup_{y\in Y}
F(x^*,y)\le \inf_{x\in
  X}F(x,y^*)+\eps.$ Grigoriadis and Khachiyan (1995) gave a simple randomized
variant of fictitious play for computing an $\eps$-approximate saddle point for
matrix games, that is, when $F$ is bilinear and the sets $X$ and $Y$ are
simplices. In this paper, we extend their method to the general case. In
particular, we show that, for functions of constant ""width"", an
$\eps$-approximate saddle point can be computed using
$O^*(\frac{(n+m)}{\eps^2}\ln R)$ random samples from log-concave distributions
over the convex sets $X$ and $Y$. It is assumed that $X$ and $Y$ have inscribed
balls of radius $1/R$ and circumscribing balls of radius $R$. As a consequence,
we obtain a simple randomized polynomial-time algorithm that computes such an
approximation faster than known methods for problems with bounded width and
when $\eps \in (0,1)$ is a fixed, but arbitrarily small constant. Our main tool
for achieving this result is the combination of the randomized fictitious play
with the recently developed results on sampling from convex sets.

faces. In the case of line arrangements, there exists an associative product
which gives this collection a structure of a left regular band. A natural
question is whether the same is possible for other arrangements. In this paper,
we try to answer this question for the simplest generalization of line
arrangements, that is, conic--line arrangements.
  Investigating the different algebraic structures induced by the face poset of
a conic--line arrangement, we present two different generalizations for the
product and its associated structures: an alternative left regular band and an
associative aperiodic semigroup. We also study the structure of sub left
regular bands induced by these arrangements. We finish with some chamber
counting results for conic--line arrangements.

splitting (DQIS), that reverses the roles of state and channel in standard
quantum information splitting. In this method, a secret is shared via
teleportation of a fiducial input state over an entangled state that encodes
the secret in a graph state basis. By performing a test of violation of a Bell
inequality on the encoded state, the legitimate parties determine if the
violation is sufficiently high to permit distilling secret bits. Thus, the code
space must be maximally and exclusively nonlocal. To this end, we propose two
ways to obtain code words that are degenerate with respect to a Bell operator.
The security of DQIS comes from monogamy of nonlocal correlations, which we
illustrate by means of a simple single-qubit attack model. The nonlocal basis
of security of our protocol makes it suitable for security in general
monogamous theories and in the more stringent, device-independent cryptographic
scenario.

of charged pions produces electron and muon-flavor neutrinos from the primary
decay of the pion, and from the secondary decay of the resulting charged
lepton. At low energies we expect the flavor ratio
$\Phi_{\nu_e}:\Phi_{\nu_\mu}:\Phi_{\nu_\tau}$ to be $1:2:0$ at the source. We
are interested in the flavor ratios as measured on Earth after the neutrinos
propagate over cosmic distance scales from the source. If we only consider
vacuum flavor transition probabilities between the three active flavors then we
expect a measured flavor ratio of $1:1:1$ up to small corrections from
$\theta_{13}$ and non-maximal $\theta_{23}$. When we include mixing with two
additional flavors of sterile neutrinos then we see corrections to this ratio
up to $\sim 30%$. Furthermore, if we consider energy-loss of the charged
leptons involved in the pion decay from cosmic sources then these flux ratios
depend on the neutrino energy. We examine these energy-dependent flavor ratios
using a specific model for sterile neutrino mixing, and compare to expected
ratios when only three neutrino flavors are considered. At energies $E_\nu >$ 1
TeV the flavor ratios observed in experiments such as IceCube can probe the

matching; assuming there exists a one-to-one relation between the visible
properties of galaxies and their host haloes. We set the sizes of the luminous
components according to the observed relations for $z\sim2$ massive quiescent
galaxies. We study the evolution of the mass-size relation, the fate of
satellite galaxies and the mass aggregation of the cluster central. From $z=2$,
these galaxies grow on average in size by a factor 5 to 10 of and in mass by 2
to 3. The stellar mass growth rate of the simulated BCGs in our sample is of
1.9 in the range $0.3<z<1.0$ consistent with observations, and of 1.5 in the
range $0.0<z<0.3$. Furthermore the satellite galaxies evolve to the present day
mass-size relation by $z=0$. Assuming passively evolving stellar populations,
we present surface brightness profiles for our cluster centrals which resemble
those observed for the cDs in similar mass clusters both at $z=0$ and at $z=1$.
This demonstrates that the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology does indeed predict minor and
major mergers to occur in galaxy clusters with the frequency and mass ratio
distribution required to explain the observed growth in size of passive
galaxies since $z=2$. Our experiment shows that Brightest Cluster Galaxies can
form through dissipationless mergers of quiescent massive $z=2$ galaxies,
without substantial additional star formation.

evolution of dwarf galaxies by constructing and analysing a homogeneous,
multiwavelength dataset for a statistically significant sample of approximately
6500 nearby dwarfs (M_i > -18 mag). We present the sample selection criteria
and describe the suite of analysis tools, some of them developed in the
framework of the Virtual Observatory. We make use of optical spectra and
UV-to-NIR imaging of the dwarf sample to derive SFRs, stellar masses, ages and
metallicities - which are further supplemented with structural parameters that
are used to classify them morphologically. This dataset, coupled with a
detailed characterisation of each dwarf's environment, allows for a fully
comprehensive investigation of their origins and to track the potential
evolutionary paths between the different dwarf types. We characterise the local
environment of all dwarfs in our sample, paying special attention to trends
with current star formation activity. We find that virtually all quiescent
dwarfs are located in the vicinity (projected distances < 1.5 Mpc) of L*
companions, consistent with recent results. While star-forming dwarfs are
preferentially found at separations of the order of 1 Mpc, there appears to be
a tail towards low separations (<100 kpc) in the distribution of projected
distances. We speculate that, modulo projection effects, this probably
represents a genuine population of late-type dwarfs caught upon first infall
about their host and before environmental quenching has fully operated. In this
context, these results suggest that internal mechanisms -such as gas exhaustion
via star formation or feedback effects- are not sufficient to completely cease
the star formation activity in dwarf galaxies, and that becoming the satellite
of a massive central galaxy appears to be a necessary condition to create a
quiescent dwarf.

Accepted for publication in ApJ Letters",,"10.1088/2041-8205/765/1/L7",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Observations of accreting black holes often provoke suggestions that their
jets precess. The precession is usually supposed to result from a combination
of the Lense-Thirring effect and accretion disc viscosity. We show that this is
unlikely for any type of black hole system, as the disc generally has too
little angular momentum compared with a spinning hole to cause any significant
movement of the jet direction across the sky on short timescales. Uncorrelated
accretion events, as in the chaotic accretion picture of active galactic
nuclei, change AGN jet directions only on timescales \gtrsim 10^7 yr. In this
picture AGN jet directions are stable on shorter timescales, but uncorrelated
with any structure of the host galaxy, as observed. We argue that observations
of black-hole jets precessing on timescales short compared to the accretion
time would be a strong indication that the accretion disc, and not the standard
Blandford-Znajek mechanism, is responsible for driving the jet. This would be
particularly convincing in a tidal disruption event. We suggest that additional
disc physics is needed to explain any jet precession on timescales short
compared with the accretion time. Possibilities include the radiation warping
instability, or disc tearing.

20 outflows from low mass young stellar objects with the goal of characterizing
the physical and chemical conditions of the emitting gas. We have used the HIFI
and PACS instruments on board the Herschel Space Observatory to observe the two
fundamental lines of ortho-water at 557 and 1670 GHz. These observations were
part of the ""Water In Star-forming regions with Herschel"" (WISH) key program,
and have been complemented with CO and H2 data. We find that the emission from
water has a different spatial and velocity distribution from that of the J=1-0
and 2-1 transitions of CO, but it has a similar spatial distribution to H2, and
its intensity follows the H2 intensity derived from IRAC images. This suggests
that water traces the outflow gas at hundreds of kelvins responsible for the H2
emission, and not the component at tens of kelvins typical of low-J CO
emission. A warm origin of the water emission is confirmed by a remarkable
correlation between the intensities of the 557 and 1670 GHz lines, which also
indicates the emitting gas has a narrow range of excitations. A non-LTE
radiative transfer analysis shows that while there is some ambiguity on the
exact combination of density and temperature values, the gas thermal pressure
nT is constrained within less than a factor of 2. The typical nT over the
sample is 4 10^{9} cm^{-3}K, which represents an increase of 10^4 with respect
to the ambient value. The data also constrain within a factor of 2 the water
column density. When this quantity is combined with H2 column densities, the
typical water abundance is only 3 10^{-7}, with an uncertainty of a factor of
3. Our data challenge current C-shock models of water production due to a
combination of wing-line profiles, high gas compressions, and low abundances.

Our modelling shows that K+A galaxies have undergone a large starburst,

older stellar population. The metal abundance of the intermediate-age stars
shows that star formation did not take place in pristine gas, but was part of a
dramatic increase in the star formation rates for originally gas-rich objects.
We find no evidence for on-going QSO activity in the UV, which is well modeled
by the emission of intermediate-age stars. We use K+A galaxies as local
counterparts of high redshift objects to test for the presence of Thermally
Pulsing AGB stars in similarly-aged populations and find no excess in the
infrared due to emission from such stars, arguing that more distant galaxies
are indeed old and massive at their redshift. All of our galaxies show
significant excesses in the mid-IR compared to the light from their stars. We
fit this ad hoc with a 300K blackbody. Possible sources include TP-AGB stars,

energy is radiated in the form of emission lines or continuum radiation, and
the main elements and ions responsible for the emission. We use a subset of
cosmological, hydrodynamical runs from the OWLS project to calculate the
emission of diffuse gas and its evolution with time. We find that at z=0 (z=2)
about 70 (80) per cent of the energy emitted by diffuse gas is carried by
emission lines, with the continuum radiation contributing the remainder.
Hydrogen lines in the Lyman series are the primary contributors to the line
emission, with a share of 16 (20) per cent. Oxygen lines are the main metal
contributors at high redshift, while silicon, carbon and iron lines are
strongest at low redshift, when the contributions of AGB stars and supernova Ia
explosions to the metal budget become important and when there is more hot gas.
The ionic species carrying the most energy are OIII, CII, CIII, SiII, SiIII,
FeII and SIII. The great majority of energy is emitted in the UV band
(lambda=100-4000 A), both as continuum radiation and line emission. With almost
no exception, all the strongest lines fall in this band. At high energies,
continuum radiation is dominant (e.g., 80 per cent in the X-ray band), while
lines contribute progressively more at lower energies. While the results do
depend on the details of the numerical implementation of the physical processes
modelled in the simulations, the comparison of results from different
simulations demonstrates that the variations are overall small, and that the
conclusions are fairly robust. Given the overwhelming importance of UV emission
for the cooling of diffuse gas, it is desirable to build instruments dedicated

synchrotron radiation from electrons accelerated at the GRB external shock,
that propagates with relativistic velocities into the magnetized interstellar
medium. By means of multi-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we
investigate the acceleration performance of weakly magnetized relativistic
shocks, in the magnetization range 0<sigma<1e-1. The pre-shock magnetic field
is orthogonal to the flow, as generically expected for relativistic shocks. We
find that relativistic perpendicular shocks propagating in electron-positron
plasmas are efficient particle accelerators if the magnetization is sigma<1e-3.
For electron-ion plasmas, the transition to efficient acceleration occurs for
sigma<3e-5. Here, the acceleration process proceeds similarly for the two
species, since the electrons enter the shock nearly in equipartition with the
ions, as a result of strong pre-heating in the self-generated upstream
turbulence. In both electron-positron and electron-ion shocks, we find that the
maximum energy of the accelerated particles scales in time as t^(1/2). This
scaling is shallower than the so-called (and commonly assumed) Bohm limit, and
it naturally results from the small-scale nature of the Weibel turbulence
generated in the shock layer. In magnetized plasmas, the energy of the
accelerated particles increases until it reaches a saturation value that scales
with the magnetization as sigma^(-1/4). Further energization is prevented by
the fact that the self-generated turbulence is confined within a finite region
of thickness proportional to sigma^(-1/2) around the shock. Our results can
provide physically-grounded inputs for models of non-thermal emission from a
variety of astrophysical sources, with particular relevance to GRB afterglows.

breaking this local symmetry by a superconducting term. The time reversal
preserving topological insulator states in 2D and 3D which can be obtained from

conservation. Hence, all topological insulators can be adiabatically connected

an intermediate superconducting term is allowed during the adiabatic

topological phases occur only in systems that break U(1) charge conservation.

of the classifying spaces of charge conserving Hamiltonians into the
corresponding Bogoliubov de Gennes classes.

JE(20 T) in Bi-2212 wires of several meters length, as well as longer pieces
wound in coils, rarely exceeds 200 A/mm2. Moreover, long-length wires often
exhibit signs of Bi-2212 leakage after melt processing that are rarely found in
short, open-end samples. We studied the length dependence of JE of
state-of-the-art powder-in-tube (PIT) Bi-2212 wires and gases released by them
during melt processing using mass spectroscopy, confirming that JE degradation
with length is due to wire swelling produced by high internal gas pressures at
elevated temperatures [1,2]. We further modeled the gas transport in Bi-2212
wires and examined the wire expansion at critical stages of the melt processing
of as-drawn PIT wires and the wires that received a degassing treatment or a
cold-densification treatment before melt processing. These investigations
showed that internal gas pressure in long-length wires drives creep of the Ag
sheath during the heat treatment, causing wire to expand, lowering the density
of Bi-2212 filaments, and therefore degrading the wire JE; the creep rupture of
silver sheath naturally leads to the leakage of Bi-2212 liquid. Our work shows
that proper control of such creep is the key to preventing Bi-2212 leakage and
achieving high JE in long-length Bi-2212 conductors and coils.

that even with dynamical quarks 't Hooft loops of arbitrary Z(N) charge are
well defined at the phase boundary. To leading order in weak coupling, the 't
Hooft loop satisfies Casimir scaling in the pure glue theory, but not with
quarks. Because the chemical potential is imaginary, typically the interaction
measure is negative on one side of the phase transition. Using a matrix model
to model the deconfining phase transition, we compute the phase diagram for
heavy quarks, in the plane of temperature and imaginary chemical potential. In
general we find intersecting lines of first order transitions. Using a modified

the connection between mergers and luminous infra-red (IR) galaxies (LIRGs).
The pairs are selected from the SDSS and have projected separations rp < 80
kpc, relative velocities dv < 300 km/s and stellar mass ratios within a factor
1:10. The IR luminosities (LIR) of galaxies in the pair and (mass, z and
environment-matched) control samples are determined from the SDSS -- IRAS
matched catalog of Hwang et al. (2010). We find a trend for increasing LIRG
fraction towards smaller pair separations, peaking at a factor of ~ 5--10 above
the median control fraction at the smallest separations (rp < 20 kpc), but
remaining elevated by a factor ~ 2--3 even out to 80 kpc (the widest
separations in our sample). We also find that LIRGs are most likely to be found
in high mass galaxies which have an approximately equal mass companion. We
confirm the results of previous studies that both the active galactic nucleus
(AGN) fraction and merger fraction increase strongly as a function of IR
luminosity. About 7% of LIRGs are associated with major mergers, as defined
within the criteria and mass completion of our sample. Finally, we quantify a
SFR offset (Delta SFR) as the enhancement (or decrement) relative to
star-forming galaxies of the same mass and redshift. We demonstrate that there
is a clear connection between the Delta SFR and the classification of a galaxy
as a LIRG that is mass dependent. Most of the LIRGs in our merger sample are
relatively high mass galaxies (log M* > 10.5), likely because the SFR
enhancement required to produce LIRG luminosities is more modest than at low
masses. The Delta SFR offers a redshift-independent metric for the
identification of the galaxies with the most enhanced star forming rates that
does not rely on fixed LIR boundaries.

decade. A primary goal was to develop high mobility semiconducting graphene
with a band gap that is large enough for high performance applications.
Graphene ribbons were thought to be semiconductors with these properties,
however efforts to produce ribbons with useful bandgaps and high mobility has
had limited success. We show here that high quality epitaxial graphene
nanoribbons 40 nm in width, with annealed edges, grown on sidewall SiC are not
semiconductors, but single channel room temperature ballistic conductors for
lengths up to at least 16 micrometers. Mobilities exceeding one million
corresponding to a sheet resistance below 1 Ohm have been observed, thereby
surpassing two dimensional graphene by 3 orders of magnitude and theoretical
predictions for perfect graphene by more than a factor of 10. The graphene
ribbons behave as electronic waveguides or quantum dots. We show that transport
in these ribbons is dominated by two components of the ground state transverse
waveguide mode, one that is ballistic and temperature independent, and a second

and insulating at cryogenic temperatures. At room temperature the resistance of
both components abruptly increases with increasing length, one at a length of
160 nm and the other at 16 micrometers. These properties appear to be related
to the lowest energy quantum states in the charge neutral ribbons. Since
epitaxial graphene nanoribbons are readily produced by the thousands, their
room temperature ballistic transport properties can be used in advanced
nanoelectronics as well.

the perspective of efficiency. We initially redefine the problem of video
object segmentation as the propagation of MRF energies along the temporal
domain. For this purpose, a novel and efficient method is proposed to propagate
MRF energies throughout the frames via bilateral filters without using any
global texture, color or shape model. Recently presented bi-exponential filter
is utilized for efficiency, whereas a novel technique is also developed to
dynamically solve graph-cuts for varying, non-lattice graphs in general linear
filtering scenario. These improvements are experimented for both automatic and
interactive video segmentation scenarios. Moreover, in addition to the
efficiency, segmentation quality is also tested both quantitatively and
qualitatively. Indeed, for some challenging examples, significant time
efficiency is observed without loss of segmentation quality.

various hypothesized components of phenotypes and fitness. Traditionally, those
components are given by the covariance, variance, and regression terms of
evolutionary models. I show how to interpret those statistical expressions with
respect to information theory. The resulting interpretation allows one to read
the fundamental equations of selection and evolution as sentences that express
how various causes lead to the accumulation of information by selection and the
decay of information by other evolutionary processes. The interpretation in

alter distances and so cosmological parameter estimation. In the era of
precision cosmology, the presence of inhomogeneities may induce systematic
errors if not properly accounted. In this vein, a new interpretation of the
conventional Dyer-Roeder (DR) approach by allowing light received from distant
sources to travel in regions denser than average is proposed. It is argued that
the existence of a distribution of small and moderate cosmic voids (or ""black
regions"") implies that its matter content was redistributed to the homogeneous
and clustered matter components with the former becoming denser than the cosmic
average in the absence of voids. Phenomenologically, this means that the DR
smoothness parameter (denoted here by $\alpha_E$) can be greater than unity,
and, therefore, all previous analyses constraining it should be rediscussed
with a free upper limit. Accordingly, by performing a statistical analysis
involving 557 type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from Union2 compilation data in a
flat $\Lambda$CDM model we obtain for the extended parameter,
$\alpha_E=1.26^{+0.68}_{-0.54}$ ($1\sigma$). The effects of $\alpha_E$ are also
analyzed for generic $\Lambda$CDM models and flat XCDM cosmologies. For both
models, we find that a value of $\alpha_E$ greater than unity is able to
harmonize SNe Ia and cosmic microwave background observations thereby
alleviating the well-known tension between low and high redshift data. Finally,
a simple toy model based on the existence of cosmic voids is proposed in order
to justify why $\alpha_E$ can be greater than unity as required by supernovae
data.

attracted much attention from both experimentalists and theorists. Different
effective interactions and novel correlated quantum many-body phases may be
engineered in these systems, with the different phases being tunable via
external parameters. In this article we investigate a two-species Fermi atom
mixture: one species of atom exists in two hyperfine states and is confined to
move in a two-leg ladder, interacting with an on-site interaction, and the
other moves freely in a two dimensional square lattice that contains the
two-leg ladder. The two species of atoms interact via an on-site interaction on
the ladder. In the limit of weak inter-species interactions, the
two-dimensional gas can be integrated out, leading to an effective long-range
mediated interaction in the ladder, generated by to the on-site inter-species
interaction. We show that the form of the mediated interaction can be
controlled by the density of the two-dimensional gas and that it enhances the
charge density wave instability in the two-leg ladder after the renormalization
group transformation. Parameterizing the phase diagram with various

equivalence in electromagnetism: this can be used to construct ""equivalent""
current sources for any desired incident field, including waveguide modes. The
effects of dispersion and discretization are discussed, and a simple technique
to separate incident and scattered fields is described in order to compensate
for imperfect equivalent currents. The important concept of the local density
of states (LDOS) is reviewed, which elucidates the relationship between current
sources and the resulting fields, including enhancement of the LDOS via mode
cutoffs (Van Hove singularities) and resonant cavities (Purcell enhancement).
We also address various other source techniques such as covering a wide range
of frequencies and incident angles in a small number of simulations for waves
incident on a periodic surface, sources to excite eigenmodes in rectangular
supercells of periodic systems, moving sources, and thermal sources via a Monte

there are also some theories of modification of gravity, by changing the law of

Until the dark matter particle is detected, there is some room for uncertainty.
So we should consider every part of the problem and solve it. Dark matter

For special $f(u)$ of the Fisher-KPP type, the problem was investigated by Du

which is $C^1$ and satisfies $f(0)=0$, we show that the omega limit set
$\omega(u)$ of every bounded positive solution is determined by a stationary
solution. For monostable, bistable and combustion types of nonlinearities, we
obtain a rather complete description of the long-time dynamical behavior of the
problem; moreover, by introducing a parameter $\sigma$ in the initial data, we
reveal a threshold value $\sigma^*$ such that spreading ($\lim_{t\to\infty}u=
1$) happens when $\sigma>\sigma^*$, vanishing ($\lim_{t\to\infty}u=0$) happens
when $\sigma<\sigma^*$, and at the threshold value $\sigma^*$, $\omega(u)$ is
different for the three different types of nonlinearities. When spreading
happens, we make use of ""semi-waves"" to determine the asymptotic spreading

citation data are collected from Google Scholar. The values of the synchronous
JDF ranges from 0.057 - 0.14 while the diachronous JDF ranges from 0.46 - 1.98.
The high diachronous JDF is explained by a relatively high number of different
citing journals against the number of publications. This implies that the
results of diachronous JDF is influenced by the numbers of publications and a
good comparison may be one of which the subject of analysis have similar number
of publications and citations period. The yearly values of the synchronous RDF
vary in the range of 0.66 - 1.00 while diachronous RDF ranges from 0.62 - 0.88.
The result shows that diachronous RDF is negatively correlated with the number
of citations, resulting in a low RDF value for highly cited publication years.
What this implies in practice is that the diffusion factors can be calculated
for every additional year at any journal level of analysis. This study
demonstrates that these indicators are valuable tools that help to show
development of journals as it changes through time.

for the magnetic field from radio emission, by assuming the energy densities in
cosmic rays and magnetic fields are the same. Yet most of the cosmic ray
content in star-forming galaxies is in protons, which are invisible in radio
emission. Therefore, the argument needs assumptions about the proton spectrum,
typically that of a constant proton/electron ratio. In some environments,
particularly starburst galaxies, the reasoning behind these assumptions does
not necessarily hold: secondary pionic positrons and electrons may be
responsible for most of the radio emission, and strong energy losses can alter
the proton/electron ratio. We derive an equipartition expression that should
work in a hadronic loss-dominated environment like starburst galaxies.
Surprisingly, despite the radically different assumptions from the classical
equipartition formula, numerically the results for starburst magnetic fields

conventional ground state wavefunctions of bosons are constrained by the

of spin-orbit coupling leads to complex-valued condensate wavefunctions beyond
this theorem. In this article, we review the study of this class of
unconventional Bose-Einstein condensations focusing on their topological

spin-orbit couplings give rise to Landau-level-like quantization of
single-particle levels in the harmonic trap. The interacting condensates
develop the half-quantum vortex structure spontaneously breaking time-reversal
symmetry and exhibit topological spin textures of the skyrmion type. In
particular, the 3D Weyl coupling generates topological defects in the
quaternionic phase space as an SU(2) generalization of the usual U(1) vortices.
Rotating spin-orbit coupled condensates exhibit rich vortex structures due to
the interplay between vorticity and spin texture. In the Mott-insulating states
in optical lattices, quantum magnetism is characterized by the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya type exchange interactions.

at the Large Hadron Collider. Understanding the exact nature of this boson is a
priority. The task now is to verify whether the boson is indeed the scalar
Higgs as proposed in the Standard Model of particle physics, or something more
esoteric as proposed in the plethora of extensions to the Standard Model. This
requires a verification that the boson is a $J^{PC}=0^{++}$ state with
couplings precisely as predicted by the Standard Model. Since a non Standard
Model boson can in some cases mimic the Standard Model Higgs in its couplings
to gauge bosons, it is essential to rule out any anomalous behavior in its
gauge couplings. We present a step by step methodology to determine the
properties of this resonance without making any assumptions about its
couplings. We present the analysis in terms of uni-angular distributions which
lead to angular asymmetries that allow for the extraction of the couplings of
the 125-126 GeV resonance to Z bosons. We show analytically and numerically,
that these asymmetries can unambiguously confirm whether the new boson is
indeed the Standard Model Higgs boson.

become cheaper, faster, and more accurate. However, assembly of such data into
high-quality, finished genome sequences remains challenging. Many genome
assembly tools are available, but they differ greatly in terms of their
performance (speed, scalability, hardware requirements, acceptance of newer
read technologies) and in their final output (composition of assembled
sequence). More importantly, it remains largely unclear how to best assess the
quality of assembled genome sequences. The Assemblathon competitions are
intended to assess current state-of-the-art methods in genome assembly. Results
- In Assemblathon 2, we provided a variety of sequence data to be assembled for
three vertebrate species (a bird, a fish, and snake). This resulted in a total
of 43 submitted assemblies from 21 participating teams. We evaluated these
assemblies using a combination of optical map data, Fosmid sequences, and
several statistical methods. From over 100 different metrics, we chose ten key
measures by which to assess the overall quality of the assemblies. Conclusions
- Many current genome assemblers produced useful assemblies, containing a
significant representation of their genes, regulatory sequences, and overall
genome structure. However, the high degree of variability between the entries
suggests that there is still much room for improvement in the field of genome
assembly and that approaches which work well in assembling the genome of one
species may not necessarily work well for another.

two-terminal and three-terminal systems are governed by the edges of the
samples. This is due to the fact that the energy transfer between a transport
electron and a conducting terminal is determined by the site most strongly
coupled to that terminal. One-dimensional systems with both nearest-neighbor
and variable-range transport as well as certain types of two-dimensional
systems, are considered. For a given sample, the changes in the thermopowers
due to modifying the bulk are quite limited, compared with those of the
conductance. When the small thermopower changes exist, their average over a
large ensemble of mesoscopic samples will vanish. We also obtain the
distribution of the thermopower in such an ensemble and show that its width
approaches a finite limit with increasing sample length. This contrasts with
the distribution of conductances in such systems, whose width vanishes in the
long sample limit. Finally, we find that the thermal conductances in the
three-terminal case have a boundary-dominated contribution, due to
non-percolating conduction paths. This contribution can become dominant when
the usual conductance is small enough. All our theoretical statements are
backed by numerical computations.

galaxies with similar SEDs to YSOs. Traditionally, selected color-color and

there is no obvious boundary between YSOs and galaxies in Color-Color Diagrams

YSOs near the boundary. In this paper, we separate the YSOs and galaxies in
multi-dimensional (Multi-D) magnitude space, which is equivalent to using all
variations of CMDs simultaneously. Comparing sources from molecular clouds to
Spitzer's SWIRE data, which have negligible amount of YSOs, we can naturally
identify YSO candidates locating outside of the galaxy populated regions in the

Taurus-Auriga-Perseus complex, one of the largest local associations of dark
clouds, by merging the two data sets of GALEX and FIMS, which made observations
at similar wavelengths. The FUV intensity varies significantly across the whole
region, but the diffuse FUV continuum is dominated by dust scattering of
stellar photons. A diffuse FUV background of $\sim$1000 CU is observed, part of
which may be attributable to the scattered photons of foreground FUV light,
located in front of the thick clouds. The fluorescent emission of molecular
hydrogen constitutes $\sim$10% of the total FUV intensity throughout the
region, generally proportional to the local continuum level. We have developed
a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code and applied it to the present clouds
complex to obtain the optical properties of dust grains and the geometrical
structures of the clouds. The albedo and the phase function asymmetry factor
were estimated to be $0.42^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$, and $0.47^{+0.11}_{-0.27}$,
respectively, in accordance with theoretical estimations as well as recent
observations. The distance and thickness of the four prominent clouds in this
complex were estimated using a single slab model applied individually to each
cloud. The results obtained were in good agreement with those from other
observations in the case of the Taurus cloud, as its geometrical structure is
rather simple. For other clouds, which were observed to have multiple
components, the results gave distances and thicknesses encompassing all
components of each cloud. The distance and thickness estimations were not
crucially sensitive to the exact values of the albedo and the phase function
asymmetry factor, while the locations of the bright field stars relative to the
clouds as initial photon sources seem to be the most important factor in the
process of fitting.

$\mathbb{F}_2$, i.e., $\mathbb{F}_2$-linear generators, are widely used as
pseudorandom number generators. For example, the Mersenne Twister MT19937 is
one of the most successful applications. An advantage of such generators is
that we can assess them quickly by using theoretical criteria, such as the
dimension of equidistribution with $v$-bit accuracy. To compute these
dimensions, several polynomial-time lattice reduction algorithms have been
proposed in the case of $\mathbb{F}_2$-linear generators.
  In this paper, in order to assess non-random bit patterns in dimensions that
are higher than the dimension of equidistribution with $v$-bit accuracy,we
focus on the relationship between points in the Couture--L'Ecuyer dual lattices
and $\mathbb{F}_2$-linear relations on the most significant $v$ bits of output
sequences, and consider a new figure of merit $N_v$ based on the minimum weight
of $\mathbb{F}_2$-linear relations whose degrees are minimal for $v$. Next, we
numerically show that MT19937 has low-weight $\mathbb{F}_2$-linear relations in
dimensions higher than 623, and show that some output vectors with specific
lags are rejected or have small $p$-values in the birthday spacings tests. We
also report that some variants of Mersenne Twister, such as WELL generators,
are significantly improved from the perspective of $N_v$.

compression than in tension, then flexure bifurcation happens indeed at lower
levels of compressive strain than predicted by previous investigations (these
included taking into account finite size effects, compressibility effects, and
strain-stiffening effects.) Here the effect of bimodularity is investigated
within the theory of incremental buckling, and bifurcation equations, numerical

examinations of the dynamics of $N$-body systems with mass loss. Multi-planet
evolved systems are particularly complex because of the mutual interactions
between the planets. Here, we study the underlying dynamical mechanisms which
can incite planetary escape in two-planet post-main sequence systems. Stellar
mass loss alone is unlikely to be rapid and high enough to eject planets at
typically-observed separations. However, the combination of mass loss and
planet-planet interactions can prompt a shift from stable to chaotic regions of
phase space. Consequently, when mass loss ceases, the unstable configuration
may cause escape. By assuming a constant stellar mass loss rate, we utilize
maps of dynamical stability to illustrate the distribution of regular and
chaotic trajectories in phase space. We show that chaos can drive the planets
to undergo close encounters, leading to the ejection of one planet. Stellar
mass loss can trigger the transition of a planetary system from a stable to
chaotic configuration, subsequently causing escape. We find that mass loss
non-adiabatically affects planet-planet interaction for the most massive
progenitor stars which avoid the supernova stage. For these cases, we present
specific examples of planetary escape.

of the model shows existence of two homogeneous phases (gas and liquid) for
J_2/J_1<1/3. In addition to the homogeneous phases, the third phase with
periodically distributed clusters appears for J_2/J_1>1/3. Phase diagrams
obtained in the self-consistent mean-field approximation for a range of values
of J_2/J_1 show very rich behavior, including reentrant melting, and
coexistence of two periodic phases (one with strong and the other one with weak
order) terminated at a critical point. We present exact solutions for the
equation of state as well as for the correlation function for characteristic
values of J_2/J_1. Based on the exact results, for J_2/J_1>1/3 we predict
pseudo-phase transitions to the ordered cluster phase indicated by a rapid
change of density for a very narrow range of pressure, and by a very large
correlation length for thermodynamic states where the periodic phase is stable
in mean field. For 1/9<J_2/J_1<1/3 the correlation function decays
monotonically below certain temperature, whereas above this temperature
exponentially damped oscillatory behavior is obtained. Thus, even though
macroscopic phase separation is energetically favored and appears for weak
repulsion at T=0, local spatial inhomogeneities appear for finite T. Monte
Carlo simulations in canonical ensemble show that specific heat has a maximum

that the half-mass radius increases during the first part (roughly half) of the

balance between the flow of energy and the central energy production for almost
all globular clusters. We also find that the majority of the globular clusters

irradiation. We applied our instrument, called SPORT, on a fast plastic
scintillator (BC-400) irradiated with 27-MeV Ar ions having high mean
electronic stopping power of 2.6 MeV/\mu m. As a consequence of increasing
permanent radiation damages with increasing ion fluence, our investigations
reveal a degradation of scintillation intensity together with, thanks to the
time-resolved measurement, a decrease in the decay constant of the
scintillator. This combination indicates that luminescence degradation
processes by both dynamic and static quenching, the latter mechanism being
predominant. Under such high density excitation, the scintillation
deterioration of BC-400 is significantly enhanced compared to that observed in
previous investigations, mainly performed using light ions. The observed
non-linear behaviour implies that the dose at which luminescence starts
deteriorating is not independent on particles' stopping power, thus
illustrating that the radiation hardness of plastic scintillators can be
strongly weakened under high excitation density in heavy ion environments.

Galaxy Mrk 335. Despite having been extensively observed by most of the largest
X-ray observatories in the last decade, this bright source was not known to
host warm absorber gas until recent XMM-Newton observations in combination with
a long-term Swift monitoring program have shown extreme flux and spectral
variability. High resolution spectra obtained by the XMM-Newton RGS detector
reveal that the wind consists of three distinct ionization components, all
outflowing at a velocity of 5000 km/s. This wind is clearly revealed when the
source is observed at an intermediate flux state (2-5e-12 ergs cm^-2 s^-1). The
analysis of multi-epoch RGS spectra allowed us to compare the absorber
properties at three very different flux states of the source. No correlation
between the warm absorber variability and the X-ray flux has been determined.
The two higher ionization components of the gas may be consistent with
photoionization equilibrium, but we can exclude this for the only ionization
component that is consistently present in all flux states (log(xi)~1.8). We
have included archival, non-simultaneous UV data from HST (FOS, STIS, COS) with
the aim of searching for any signature of absorption in this source that so far
was known for being absorption-free in the UV band. In the COS spectra obtained
a few months after the X-ray observations we found broad absorption in CIV
lines intrinsic to the AGN and blueshifted by a velocity roughly comparable to
the X-ray outflow. The global behavior of the gas in both bands can be
explained by variation of the covering factor and/or column density, possibly
due to transverse motion of absorbing clouds moving out of the line of sight at
Broad Line Region scale.

cosmological observation by WMAP9 and Planck2013 with the relatively lower
field values during the inflationary epoch. Most interestingly, a small value
of tensor-to-scalar ratio requires a large non-minimal coupling in our

{\cal S}^{1}$ with ${\cal R}^3$ representing the configuration space of a one
particle system to which is attached the U(1) fibre bundle represented by the
manifold ${\cal S}^{1}$. The manifold ${\cal S}^{1}$ is chosen to correspond to
the action phase, with the action being the principal function corresponding to
the associated classical dynamical system. A Hilbert space representation of
the flow equation representing the dynamics in the above product space is then
obtained, which is found to yield a probability amplitude formalism in terms of
a generalized set of equations of the Schr\""odinger form which constitutes a
covering formalism for both quantum and classical mechanics. Being labelled by
an integral index $n$, the equation corresponding to $n=1$ is identified with
the Schr\""odinger equation, while equations corresponding to $n\rightarrow
large$ yield the classical dynamics through the WKB limit. Equations with lower
indices n=2,3,4,... predict the existence of new modes of non-classical
behaviour, the observational implications of which are discussed. Some
preliminary experimental results are presented which point to the existence of
these modes of non-classical behaviour.

twin kHz QPOs may share the common properties of LXMBs and have the same

the goldstini-photon-neutralino interaction may be very small while the

sizable. This can induce a new decay mode for the Higgs boson: h-> G'+\chi ->

mapping space, we consider the general problem of how to transfer local
properties from a smooth space to an associated mapping space. This leads to
the notion of smoothly local properties.
  In realising the definition of a local property at a particular point it may
be that there are choices that need to be made. To say that the local property
is smoothly local is to say that those choices can be made smoothly dependent
on the point. In particular, that a manifold has charts is a local property. A
local addition is the structure needed to say that there is a way to choose a
chart about each point so that it varies smoothly with that point.
  To be able to extend these ideas beyond that of the local additivity of
manifolds we work in a category of generalised smooth spaces. We are thus are
able to consider more general mapping spaces than just those arising from the
maps from one smooth manifold to another and thus able to generalise the
standard result on when this space of maps is again a smooth manifold.
  As applications of this generalisation we show that the mapping spaces
involving the various figure 8s from String Topology are manifolds, and that
they embed as submanifolds with tubular neighbourhoods in the corresponding
loop spaces. We also show that applying the mapping space functor to a regular
map of manifolds produces a regular map on the mapping spaces.

B_{s,d} meson decays in a ""Minimal Theory of Fermion Masses"" (MTFM). In this
theory Yukawa couplings are generated through the mixing with heavy vectorlike
(VF) fermions. This implies corrections to the SM quark couplings to W, Z and
Higgs so that FCNC processes receive contributions from tree level Z and Higgs
exchanges and W bosons couple to right-handed quarks. In a particular version
of this model in which the Yukawa matrix lambda^D in the heavy down fermion
sector is unitary, lambda^U =1 and M = M_{VF} is fixed, only three real and
positive definite parameters describe New Physics (NP) contributions to all
Delta F=2 and Delta F=1 observables in K and B_{s,d} systems once the known
quark masses and the CKM matrix are correctly reproduced. For M>1 TeV NP
contributions to B_{s,d}^0- bar{B}_{s,d}^0 mixings are found to be very small.
While in principle NP contributions to epsilon_K and Delta F=1 processes could
be large, the correlation between epsilon_K and K_L->mu^+ mu^- eliminates
basically NP contributions to epsilon_K and right-handed current contributions
to Delta F=1 FCNC observables. We find CMFV structure in B_{s,d} decays with
BR(B_{s,d}->mu^+ mu^-) uniquely enhanced for M=3 TeV by at least 35% and almost
up to a factor of two over their SM values. Also BR(K^+->pi^+ bar{nu} nu) and
BR(K_L->pi^0 bar{nu} nu)$ are uniquely enhanced by similar amount but the
correlation between them differs from the CMFV one. We emphasize various
correlations between K and B_{s,d} decays that could test this scenario. The
model favours gamma=68{\deg}, |V_{ub}|=0.0037, S_{psi K_S}=0.72, S_{psi
phi}=0.04 and 4.2*10^-9<BR(B_s->mu^+ mu^-)<5.0*10^-9 for M=3-4 TeV.

approaches to noncommutativity, deformed primitive operators are postulated to
act additively. A Drinfel'd twist implies non-additive effects which are
controlled by the coproduct. We illustrate these features for a class of

target sequence on DNA by using the facilitated diffusion mechanism. However,
whether this strategy of alternating between three-dimensional bulk diffusion
and one-dimensional sliding along the DNA contour is still beneficial in the
crowded interior of cells is highly disputed. Here we use a simple model for
the bacterial genome inside the cell and present a semi-analytical model for
the in vivo target search of transcription factors within the facilitated
diffusion framework. Without having to resort to extensive simulations we
determine the mean search time of a lac repressor in a living E. coli cell by
including parameters deduced from experimental measurements. The results agree
very well with experimental findings, and thus the facilitated diffusion
picture emerges as a quantitative approach to gene regulation in living
bacteria cells. Furthermore we see that the search time is not very sensitive
to the parameters characterizing the DNA configuration and that the cell seems
to operate very close to optimal conditions for target localization. Local
searches as implied by the colocalization mechanism are only found to mildly
accelerate the mean search time within our model.

low-lying metastable 2D3/2 state that can become populated due to spontaneous
emission from the 2P1/2 excited state. This requires a repumper laser to
maintain the ion in the Doppler cooling cycle. Typically the 2D3/2 state, or
some of its hyperfine components if the ion has nuclear spin, has a higher
multiplicity than the upper state of the repumping transition. This can lead to
dark states, which have to be destabilized by an external magnetic field or by
modulating the polarization of the repumper laser. We propose using
unpolarized, incoherent amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) to drive the
repumping transition. An ASE source offers several advantages compared to a
laser. It prevents the buildup of dark states without external polarization
modulation even in zero magnetic field, it can drive multiple hyperfine
transitions simultaneously, and it requires no frequency stabilization. These
features make it very compact and robust, which is essential for the
development of practical, transportable optical ion clocks. We construct a
theoretical model for the ASE radiation, including the possibility of the
source being partially polarized. Using 88Sr+ as an example, the performance of
the ASE source compared to a single-mode laser is analyzed by numerically
solving the eight-level density matrix equations for the involved energy
levels. Finally a reduced three-level system is derived, yielding a simple
formula for the excited state population and scattering rate, which can be used
to optimize the experimental parameters. The required ASE power spectral
density can be obtained with current technology.

requires selection of a set of SNPs summarizing the association in a region. We
show that the SNP selection method greatly affects type 1 error rates, with
published studies having used methods expected to result in substantially
inflated type 1 error rates. We show that either avoiding variable selection
and instead testing the most informative principal components or integrating
over variable selection using Bayesian model averaging can lead to correct

Hashimoto's thyroiditis reveals a common genetic signature across seven regions
shared between the diseases, and indicates that in five of six regions
associated with Graves' disease and not Hashimoto's thyroiditis, this more
likely reflects genuine absence of association with the latter rather than lack
of power. Our examination, by simulation, of the performance of colocalisation
tests and associated software will foster more widespread adoption of formal
colocalisation testing. Given the increasing availability of large expression
and genetic association data sets from disease-relevant tissue and purified
cell populations, coupled with identification of regulatory sequences by
projects such as ENCODE, colocalisation analysis has the potential to reveal
both shared genetic signatures of related traits and causal disease genes and

time-calibrated phylogenies for the inference of diversification processes.
This requires computing the likelihood of a given ultrametric tree as the
reconstructed tree produced by a given model of diversification. Etienne &
Rosindell (2012) proposed a lineage-based model of diversification, called
protracted speciation, where species remain incipient during a random duration
before turning good species, and showed that this can explain the slowdown in
lineage accumulation observed in real phylogenies. However, they were unable to
provide a general likelihood formula. Here, we present a likelihood formula for
protracted speciation models, where rates at which species turn good or become
extinct can depend both on their age and on time. Our only restrictive
assumption is that speciation rate does not depend on species status.
  Our likelihood formula utilizes a new technique, based on the contour of the
phylogenetic tree and first developed in Lambert (2010). We consider the
reconstructed trees spanned by all extant species, by all good extant species,
or by all representative species, which are either good extant species or
incipient species representative of some good extinct species. Specifically, we
prove that each of these trees is a coalescent point process, that is, a
planar, ultrametric tree where the coalescence times between two consecutive
tips are independent, identically distributed random variables. We characterize
the common distribution of these coalescence times in some, biologically
meaningful, special cases for which the likelihood reduces to an elegant
analytical formula or becomes numerically tractable.

We discuss a new experiment on search for decays of GeV-scale sterile

matter-antimatter asymmetry generation and for the active neutrino masses. If
lighter than 2 GeV, these particles can be produced in decays of charm mesons

and subsequently decay into light SM particles. In order to fully explore this

a big volume detector constructed from a large amount of identical single
modules, with a total sterile neutrino decay length of few kilometers. The
preliminary feasibility study for the proposed experiment shows that it has
sensitivity which may either lead to the discovery of new particles below the

tetragonal (PbO type), simple monoclinic, orthorhombic (MnP type), hexagonal
(NiAs and wurzite type) and cubic (CsCl and NaCl type). We predict pressure to
drive the system through different magnetic ordering (notably also some
ferromagnetic phases) eventually suppressing magnetism at around 17GPa. We
speculate the ferromagnetic order to be the reason for the absence of a
superconducting phase in FeTe at variance with the case of FeSe.

the population distribution of molecular quantum states after three-body

detection scheme which combines photoionization of the molecules with
subsequent ion trapping. By analyzing the ionization spectrum, we identify the
population of energy levels with binding energies up to $h\times 750\:$GHz. We
find a broad population of electronic and nuclear spin states and determine a
range of populated vibrational and rotational states. The method presented here

the tradeoff between dispersal case and the beneficial role of dispersal in
limiting fluctuations, leads to an advantage of one dispersal rate over

observational and experimental data in order to learn causal Bayesian networks.
Observational data are passively observed. Experimental data, such as that
produced by randomized controlled trials, result from the experimenter
manipulating one or more variables (typically randomly) and observing the
states of other variables. The paper presents a Bayesian method for learning
the causal structure and parameters of the underlying causal process that is
generating the data, given that (1) the data contains a mixture of
observational and experimental case records, and (2) the causal process is
modeled as a causal Bayesian network. This learning method was applied using as
input various mixtures of experimental and observational data that were
generated from the ALARM causal Bayesian network. In these experiments, the
absolute and relative quantities of experimental and observational data were
varied systematically. For each of these training datasets, the learning method
was applied to predict the causal structure and to estimate the causal
parameters that exist among randomly selected pairs of nodes in ALARM that are
not confounded. The paper reports how these structure predictions and parameter
estimates compare with the true causal structures and parameters as given by
the ALARM network.

clique potentials. This paper presents a new unified approach that combines
approximate inference and the clique tree algorithm, thereby circumventing this

instances of this approach. The algorithm essentially does clique tree
propagation, using approximate inference to estimate the densities in each

to gradually improve the quality of the estimation.

In contrast to this, in supervised model selection it is a priori known that
the chosen model will be used in the future for prediction tasks involving more
``focused' predictive distributions. Although focused predictive distributions
can be produced from the joint probability distribution by marginalization, in
practice the best model in the unsupervised sense does not necessarily perform
well in supervised domains. In particular, the standard marginal likelihood
score is a criterion for the unsupervised task, and, although frequently used
for supervised model selection also, does not perform well in such tasks. In
this paper we study the performance of the marginal likelihood score
empirically in supervised Bayesian network selection tasks by using a large
number of publicly available classification data sets, and compare the results
to those obtained by alternative model selection criteria, including empirical
crossvalidation methods, an approximation of a supervised marginal likelihood

provide out-puts in the form of fuzzy sets that represent the inferred
conclusions. Linguistic interpretation of such outputs often involves the use
of linguistic approximation that assigns a linguistic label to a fuzzy set
based on the predefined primary terms, linguistic modifiers and linguistic
connectives. More generally, linguistic approximation can be formalized in the
terms of the re-translation rules that correspond to the translation rules in
ex-plicitation (e.g. simple, modifier, composite, quantification and
qualification rules) in com-puting with words [Zadeh 1996]. However most
existing methods of linguistic approximation use the simple, modifier and
composite re-translation rules only. Although these methods can provide a
sufficient approximation of simple fuzzy sets the approximation of more complex
ones that are typical in many practical applications of fuzzy systems may be
less satisfactory. Therefore the question arises why not use in linguistic
ap-proximation also other re-translation rules corre-sponding to the
translation rules in explicitation to advantage. In particular linguistic
quantifica-tion may be desirable in situations where the conclusions
interpreted as quantified linguistic propositions can be more informative and
natu-ral. This paper presents some aspects of linguis-tic approximation in the
context of the re-translation rules and proposes an approach to linguistic
approximation with the use of quantifi-cation rules, i.e. quantified linguistic
approxima-tion. Two methods of the quantified linguistic approximation are
considered with the use of lin-guistic quantifiers based on the concepts of the
non-fuzzy and fuzzy cardinalities of fuzzy sets. A number of examples are
provided to illustrate the proposed approach.

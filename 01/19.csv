Antenna (ANITA) is designed to detect the up-coming radio frequency (RF) signal
resulting from a sub-surface neutrino-nucleon collision. Although no neutrinos
have been discovered thus far, ANITA is nevertheless the only experiment to
self-trigger on radio frequency emissions from cosmic-ray induced atmospheric
air showers. In the majority of those cases, down-coming RF signals are
observed via their reflection from the Antarctic ice sheet and back up to the
ANITA interferometer. Estimating the energy scale of the incident cosmic rays
therefore requires an estimate of the fractional power reflected at the air-ice
interface. Similarly, inferring the energy of neutrinos interacting in-ice from
observations of the upwards-directed signal refracting out to ANITA also
requires consideration of signal coherence across the interface. By comparing
the direct Solar RF signal intensity measured with ANITA to the
surface-reflected Solar signal intensity, as a function of incident elevation
angle relative to the surface {\Theta}, we estimate the power reflection
coefficients R({\Theta}). We find general consistency between our average
measurements and the values of R({\Theta}) expected from the Fresnel equations,

electrons and holes in a periodically driven superconductor. We study the
experimental signatures of Floquet Majorana fermions in transport measurements
and show, both analytically and numerically, that their presence is signaled by
a quantized conductance sum rule over discrete values of lead bias differing by
multiple absorption or emission energies at drive frequency. We also study the
effects of static disorder and find that the quantized sum rule is robust
against weak disorder. Thus, we offer a unique way to identify the topological
signatures of Floquet Majorana fermions.

recent interaction with an infalling subcluster. Abell 3376 is a nearby
(z=0.046) massive galaxy cluster whose bullet-shaped X-ray emission indicates
that it may have undergone a recent collision. It displays a pair of Mpc-scale
radio relics and its brightest cluster galaxy is located 970 h_70^-1 kpc away
from the peak of X-ray emission, where the second brightest galaxy lies. We
attempt to recover the dynamical history of Abell 3376. We perform a set of
N-body adiabatic hydrodynamical simulations using the SPH code Gadget-2. These
simulations of binary cluster collisions are aimed at exploring the parameter
space of possible initial configurations. By attempting to match X-ray
morphology, temperature, virial mass and X-ray luminosity, we set approximate
constraints on some merger parameters. Our best models suggest a collision of
clusters with mass ratio in the range 1/6-1/8, and having a subcluster with
central gas density four times higher than that of the major cluster. Models
with small impact parameter (b<150 kpc), if any, are preferred. We estimate
that Abell 3376 is observed approximately 0.5 Gyr after core passage, and that
the collision axis is inclined by i~40 degrees with respect to the plane of the
sky. The infalling subcluster drives a supersonic shock wave that propagates at
almost 2600 km/s, implying a Mach number as high as M~4; but we show how it
would have been underestimated as M~3 due to projection effects.

Ic-anisotropy up to 1.4T under maximum Lorentz force configuration. The
Ic-sensitivity to applied stress changed significantly in the
GdBCO/IBADconductors after irradiation, whereas nearly no change was observed

the GdBCO/IBAD-sample after irradiation. The angular dependence of Ic changed
for both samples in different ways after the irradiation, but no change in the

  Materials: Localization Model Description",,,,,"cond-mat.soft cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","  Classical network elasticity theories are based on the concept of flexible
volumeless polymers fixed into a network in which there are no excluded volume,
or even topological interactions, and where the chains explore accessible
configurations by Brownian motion. In this type of model, the elasticity of the
network derives from the entropic changes arising from a displacement of the
network junction positions. The shortcoming of this approach is clear from the
observation that unswollen rubbery materials are nearly incompressible,
reflecting the existence of strong intermolecular interactions that restrict
the polymer chains to an exploration of their local tube-like molecular
environments. The imposition of a deformation of these solid rubbery materials
then necessitates a consideration of how the local molecular packing
constraints become modified under deformation and the impact of these changes
on the macroscopic elasticity of the material as a whole. Many researchers have
struggled with this difficult problem, in the present paper we focus on the
simple localization model of rubber elasticity of Gaylord and Douglas, which
provides a simple minimal model for the network elasticity of rubbers having
strong intermolecular interactions in the dense polymer state. Particular
emphasis is given in the implications of this model in describing how network
elasticity changes with swelling by a solvent, a phenomenon where large
deviations from classical elasticity have been observed and a situation
relevant to numerous applications involving rubbery materials. We also discuss
the nature of entanglement based on the same packing picture and deduce general
relationships for entanglement in terms of molecular parameters and we find
that our predictions accord with recent experimental correlations relating
chain molecular structure to the entanglement molecular mass

nature of photons and was first experimentally observed by Hong, Ou, and Mandel
(HOM) [1]. Here, we present the observation of the HOM effect with two
independent single-photon sources in the microwave frequency domain. We probe
the indistinguishability of single photons, created with a controllable delay,
in time-resolved second-order cross- and auto-correlation function

different photon numbers and detect coherence in and between the output arms.
This measurement scheme allows us to observe the HOM effect and, in addition,
to fully characterize the two-mode entanglement of the spatially separated beam
splitter output modes. Our experiments constitute a first step towards using
two-photon interference at microwave frequencies for quantum communication and
information processing, e.g. for distributing entanglement between nodes of a

demonstrate this orientation dependence in three different systems - a

representation Higgs scalars to describe the long distance quark-antiquark
interaction in pure Yang-Mills theory, and later to obtain an effective string
theory. The empirically determined parameters of the non-Abelian effective
theory yielded $Z_N$ flux tubes resembling those of the Abelian Higgs model
with Landau-Ginzburg parameter equal to $ 1/\sqrt{2}$, corresponding to a
superconductor on the border between type I and type II. However, the physical
significance of the differences between the Abelian and the $Z_N$ vortices was
not elucidated and no principle was found to fix the value of the
'Landau-Ginzburg parameter' $\kappa$ of the non-Abelian theory determining the
structure of the $Z_N$ vortices. Here we reexamine this point of view. We
propose a consistency condition on $Z_N$ vortices underlying a confining
string. This fixes the value of $\kappa$. The transverse distribution of
pressure $p(r)$ in the resulting $Z_N$ flux tubes provides a physical picture
of these vortices which differs essentially from that of the vortices of the
Abelian Higgs model. We speculate that this general picture is valid
independent of the details of the effective magnetic gauge theory from which it
was obtained. Long wavelength fluctuations of the axis of the $Z_N$ vortices
lead from an effective field theory to an effective string theory with the
Nambu-Goto action. This effective string theory depends on a single parameter,
the string tension $\sigma$. In contrast, the effective field theory has a
second parameter, the intrinsic width 1/M of the flux tube.

(2010) to be a likely z~8-9 galaxy on the basis of its colours in the HST ACS

targetted for VLT/SINFONI integral field spectroscopy by Lehnert et al. (2010),
who published a candidate Lyman-alpha emission line at z=8.55 from this source.
In our independent spectroscopy using two different infrared spectrographs (5
hours with VLT/XSHOOTER and 11 hours with Subaru/MOIRCS) we are unable to
reproduce this line. We do not detect any emission line at the spectral and
spatial location reported in Lehnert et al. (2010), despite the expected signal
in our combined MOIRCS & XSHOOTER data being 5-sigma. The line emission also
seems to be ruled out by the faintness of this object in recently extremely
deep F105W (Y-band) HST/WFC3 imaging from HUDF12; the line would fall within
this filter and such a galaxy should have been detected at Y(AB)=28.6mag (~20
sigma) rather than the marginal Y(AB)~30mag observed in the Y-band image, >3
times fainter than would be expected if the emission lie was real. Hence it
appears highly unlikely that the reported Lyman-alpha line emission at z>8 is
real, meaning that the highest-redshift sources for which Lyman-alpha emission
has been seen are at z=6.9-7.2. It is conceivable that Lyman-alpha does not
escape galaxies at higher redshifts, where the Gunn-Peterson absorption renders
the Universe optically thick to this line. However, deeper spectroscopy on a
larger sample of candidate z>7 galaxies will be needed to test this.

set of facilities and clients located in a common metric space. The goal is to
move each facility from its initial location to a destination and assign each
client to the destination of some facility so as to minimize the sum of the
movement-costs of the facilities and the client-assignment costs. This
abstracts facility-location settings where one has the flexibility of moving
facilities from their current locations to other destinations so as to serve
clients more efficiently by reducing their assignment costs.
  We give the first {\em local-search based} approximation algorithm for this
problem and achieve the best-known approximation guarantee. Our main result is
$(3+\epsilon)$-approximation for this problem for any constant $\epsilon>0$
using local search. The previous best guarantee was an 8-approximation
algorithm based on LP-rounding. Our guarantee {\em matches} the best-known
approximation guarantee for the $k$-median problem. Since there is an
approximation-preserving reduction from the $k$-median problem to \mfl, any
improvement of our result would imply an analogous improvement for the
$k$-median problem. Furthermore, {\em our analysis is tight} (up to $o(1)$
factors) since the tight example for the local-search based 3-approximation
algorithm for $k$-median can be easily adapted to show that our local-search
algorithm has a tight approximation ratio of 3. One of the chief novelties of
the analysis is that in order to generate a suitable collection of local-search
moves whose resulting inequalities yield the desired bound on the cost of a
local-optimum, we define a tree-like structure that (loosely speaking)
functions as a ""recursion tree"", using which we spawn off local-search moves by
exploring this tree to a constant depth.

the dark sector of the Universe. Nonrelativistic massless particles are
introduced as a realization of the Galilei group in an enlarged phase space.
The additional degrees of freedom allow for a nonstandard, minimal coupling to
gravity respecting Einstein's equivalence principle. Extended to a
self-gravitating fluid the Poisson equation for the gravitational potential
contains a dynamically generated effective gravitational mass density of either
sign. The equations of motion (EOMs) contain no free parameters and are
invariant w.r.t. Milne gauge transformations. Fixing the gauge eliminates the
unphysical degrees of freedom. The resulting Lagrangian possesses no free
particle limit. The particles it describes, darkons, exist only as fluid
particles of a self-gravitating fluid. This darkon fluid realizes the zero-mass
Galilean algebra extended by dilations with dynamical exponent z = 5/3. We
reduce the EOMs to Friedmann-like equations, derive conserved quantities and a
unique Hamiltonian dynamics by implementing dilation symmetry. By the Casimir
of the Poisson-bracket (PB)-algebra we foliate the phase space and construct a
Lagrangian in reduced phase space. We solve the Friedmann-like equations with
the transition redshift and the value of the Casimir as integration constants.
We obtain a deceleration phase for the early Universe and an acceleration phase
for the late Universe in agreement with observations. Steady state equations in
the spherically symmetric case may model a galactic halo. Numerical solutions
of a nonlinear differential equation for the gravitational potential lead to
predictions for the dark matter (DM) part of the rotation curves (RCs) of
galaxies in qualitative agreement with observational data. We also present a
general covariant generalization of the model.

to explore new physics and novel device applications, but many of its basic
properties remain unresolved. Here we report the synthesis and systematic Raman
study of tBLG. Chemical vapor deposition was used to synthesize hexagon- shaped
tBLG with a rotation angle that can be conveniently determined by relative edge
misalignment. Superlattice structures are revealed by the observation of two
distinctive Raman features: folded optical phonons and enhanced intensity of
the 2D-band. Both signatures are strongly correlated with G-line resonance,
rotation angle and laser excitation energy. The frequency of folded phonons
decreases with the increase of the rotation angle due to increasing size of the
reduced Brillouin zone (rBZ) and the zone folding of transverse optic (TO)
phonons to the rBZ of superlattices. The anomalous enhancement of 2D-band
intensity is ascribed to the constructive quantum interference between two
Raman paths enabled by a near-degenerate Dirac cone. The fabrication and Raman
identification of superlattices pave the way for further basic study and new
applications of tBLG.

the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code Enzo2.0. The code was used to calculate
the ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) of initially spherical, uniform density
and rotation clouds with density perturbations, i.e., the Boss and Bodenheimer
(1979) standard isothermal test case for three dimensional (3D) hydrodynamics
(HD) codes. After first verifying that Enzo reproduces the binary fragmentation
expected for the non-magnetic test case, a large set of models was computed
with varied initial magnetic field strengths and directions with respect to the
cloud core axis of rotation (parallel or perpendicular), density perturbation
amplitudes, and equations of state. Three significantly different outcomes
resulted: (1) contraction without sustained collapse, forming a denser cloud
core, (2) collapse to form a single protostar with significant spiral arms, and
(3) collapse and fragmentation into binary or multiple protostar systems, with
multiple spiral arms. Comparisons are also made with previous MHD calculations
of similar clouds with barotropic equations of state. These results for the
collapse of initially uniform density spheres illustrate the central importance
of both magnetic field direction and field strength for determining the outcome

processes that can significantly influence their evolution. However, the
typical L* satellite galaxy resides in much lower mass galaxy groups, where the
processes capable of altering their evolution are generally weaker and have had
less time to operate. To investigate the extent to which satellite and central
galaxy evolution differs, we separately model the stellar mass - halo mass (M*
-Mh) relation for these two populations over the redshift interval 0 < z < 1.
This relation for central galaxies is constrained by the galaxy stellar mass
function while the relation for satellite galaxies is constrained against
recent measurements of the galaxy two-point correlation function (2PCF). At z ~
0 the satellites, on average, have ~10% larger stellar masses at fixed peak
subhalo mass compared to central galaxies of the same halo mass. This is
required in order to reproduce the observed stellar mass-dependent 2PCF and
satellite fractions. At low masses our model slightly under-predicts the
correlation function at ~1 Mpc scales. At z ~ 1 the satellite and central
galaxy M*-Mh relations are consistent within the errors, and the model provides
an excellent fit to the clustering data. At present, the errors on the
clustering data at z ~ 2 are too large to constrain the satellite model. A
simple model in which satellite and central galaxies share the same M*-Mh
relation is able to reproduce the extant z ~ 2 clustering data. We speculate
that the striking similarity between the satellite and central galaxy M*-Mh
relations since z ~ 2 arises because the central galaxy relation evolves very
weakly with time and because the stellar mass of the typical satellite galaxy
has not changed significantly since it was accreted. [Abridged]

galaxies. It has been suggested that this accretion proceeds along narrow
streams that might also directly drive the turbulence in galactic gas,
dynamical disturbances, and bulge formation. In cosmological simulations,
however, it is impossible to isolate and hence disentangle the effect of
accretion from internal instabilities and mergers. Moreover, in most
cosmological simulations, the phase structure and turbulence in the ISM arising
from stellar feedback are treated in a sub-grid manner, so that feedback cannot
generate ISM turbulence. In this paper we therefore test the effects of cold
streams in extremely high-resolution simulations of otherwise isolated galaxy
disks using detailed models for star formation and feedback; we then include or
exclude mock cold flows falling onto the galaxies with accretion rates,
velocities and geometry set to maximize their effect on the disk. We find: (1)
Turbulent velocity dispersions in gas disks are identical with or without the
cold flow; the energy injected by the flow is dissipated where it meets the
disk. (2) In runs without stellar feedback, the presence of a cold flow has
essentially no effect on runaway local collapse, resulting in star formation
rates (SFRs) that are far too large. (3) Disks in runs with feedback and cold
flows have higher SFRs, but only insofar as they have more gas. (4) Because
flows are extended relative to the disk, they do not trigger strong resonant
responses and so induce weak morphological perturbation (bulge formation via
instabilities is not accelerated). (5) However, flows can thicken the disk by
direct contribution of out-of-plane streams. We conclude that while inflows are
critical over cosmological timescales to determine the supply and angular
momentum of gas disks, they have weak instantaneous dynamical effects on
galaxies.

Preskill, 't Hooft, and myself is now being challenged by the
Almheiri-Marolf-Polchinski-Sully firewall argument. The AMPS argument relies on
an implicit assumption---the ``proximity postulate---which says that the
interior of a black hole must be constructed from degrees of freedom that are
physically near the black hole. The proximity postulate manifestly contradicts
the idea that interior information is redundant with information in Hawking
radiation, which is very far from the black hole. AMPS argue that a violation
of the proximity postulate would lead to a contradiction in a
thought-experiment in which Alice distills the Hawking radiation and brings a
bit back to the black hole. According to AMPS the only way to protect against
the contradiction is for a firewall to form at the Page time. But the
measurement that Alice must make, is of such a fine-grained nature that
carrying it out before the black hole evaporates may be impossible. Harlow and
Hayden have found evidence that the limits of quantum computation do in fact
prevent Alice from carrying out her experiment in less than exponential time.
If their conjecture is correct then black hole complementarity may be alive and
well.

measured the current-voltage characteristics and the resistive transition in

The resistance, measured as a function of temperature close to Tc, has been

data to test whether intron delay affects gene expression genome-wide, and to
determine its consequences for the evolution of gene structure. We find that
long zygotically expressed, but not maternally deposited, genes show
substantial delay in expression relative to their shorter counterparts and that
this delay persists over a substantial portion of the ~24 hours of
embryogenesis. Patterns of RNA-seq coverage from the 5' and 3' ends of

terminate transcription, but not with transcriptional initiation-based
regulatory control. Highly expressed zygotic genes are subject to purifying
selection to maintain compact transcribed regions, allowing conservation of

intron delay is an underappreciated physical mechanism affecting both patterns

oblate within the inner ~20 kpc and triaxial beyond this radius. About 43% of
orbits are short axis tubes - the rest belong to orbit families that
characterize triaxial potentials (boxes, long-axis tubes and chaotic orbits),
but their shapes are close to axisymmetric. We find no evidence that the
self-consistent distribution function of the nearly oblate inner halo is
comprised primarily of axisymmetric short-axis tube orbits. Orbits of all

eccentricity >0.6. We find that randomly selected samples of halo stars show no

events can be clearly identified in plots of metallicity versus formation time.
Dynamically young tidal debris is found primarily on a single type of orbit.
However, stars associated with older satellites become chaotically mixed during
the formation process (possibly due to scattering by the central bulge and
disk, and baryonic processes), and appear on all four types of orbits. We find
that the tidal debris in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations experiences
significantly more chaotic evolution than in collisionless simulations, making
it much harder to identify individual progenitors using phase space coordinates
alone. However by combining information on stellar ages and chemical abundances
with the orbital properties of halo stars in the underlying self-consistent
potential, the identification of progenitors is likely to be possible.

thousands of Kelvin. Because of their large day-night temperature differences,
condensable species that are stable in the gas phase on the dayside, such as
TiO and silicates, may condense and gravitationally settle on the nightside.
Atmospheric circulation may counterbalance this tendency to gravitationally
settle. This three dimensional (3D) mixing of chemical species has not
previously been studied for hot Jupiters, yet it is crucial to assess the
existence and distribution of TiO and silicates in the atmospheres of these
planets. We perform 3D global circulation models of HD209458b including passive
tracers that advect with the 3D flow, including a source/sink on the nightside
to represent condensation and gravitational settling of haze particles. We show
that global advection patterns produce strong vertical mixing that can keep
condensable species lofted as long as they are trapped in particles of sizes of
a few microns or less on the night side. We show that vertical mixing results
not from small-scale convection but from the large-scale circulation driven by
the day-night heating contrast. Although this vertical mixing is not diffusive
in any rigorous sense, a comparison of our results with idealized diffusion
models allows a rough estimate of the vertical diffusion coefficient.
Kzz=5x10**4/Sqrt(Pbar) m2/s can be used in 1D models of HD 209458b. Moreover,
our models exhibit strong spatial and temporal variability in the tracer
concentration that could result in observable variations during transit or
secondary eclipse measurements. Finally, we apply our model to the case of TiO
in HD209458b and show that the day-night cold trap would deplete TiO if it
condenses into particles bigger than a few microns on the planet's night side,
making it unable to create the observed stratosphere of the planet.

prompt signals, namely, its primary quasi-thermal spectrum and high energy
tail. This mechanism can be applied to either assumption of GRB progenitor:
coalescence of compact objects or hypernova explosion. The key ingredients of
our model are: (1) The initial stage of a GRB is in the form of a relativistic
quark-gluon plasma ""lava""; (2) The expansion and cooling of this lava results
in a QCD phase transition that induces a sudden gravitational stoppage of the
condensed non-relativistic baryons and form a hadrosphere; (3) Acoustic shocks
and Alfven waves (magnetoquakes) that erupt in episodes from the epicenter
efficiently transport the thermal energy to the hadrospheric surface and induce
a rapid detachment of leptons and photons from the hadrons; (4) The detached
$e^+e^-$ and $\gamma$ form an opaque, relativistically hot leptosphere, which
expands and cools to $T \sim mc^2$, or 0.5 MeV, where $e^+e^- \to 2\gamma$ and
its reverse process becomes unbalanced, and the GRB photons are finally
released; (5) The ""mode-conversion"" of Alfven waves into electromagnetic waves
in the leptosphere provides a ""snowplow"" acceleration and deceleration that
gives rise to both the high energy spectrum of GRB and the erosion of its
thermal spectrum down to a quasi-thermal distribution. According to this model,
the observed GRB photons should have a redshifted peak frequency at $E_p \sim
\Gamma(1 + \beta/2)mc^2/(1 + z),$ where $\Gamma\sim {\cal{O}}(1)$ is the
Lorentz factor of the bulk flow of the lava, which may be determined from the

show how to avoid computing these deflating subspaces explicitly while still
enforcing interpolation. The question of how to choose interpolation points
optimally naturally arises as in the standard state space setting. We answer
this question in the framework of the H2-norm by extending the Iterative
Rational Krylov Algorithm (IRKA) to descriptor systems. Several numerical
examples are used to illustrate the theoretical discussion.

dynamic and discrete optimization problems. Interpreted as an approximate
dynamic programming algorithm, a rollout algorithm estimates the value-to-go at
each decision stage by simulating future events while following a greedy
policy, referred to as the base policy. While in many cases rollout algorithms
are guaranteed to perform as well as their base policies, there have been few
theoretical results showing additional improvement in performance. In this
paper we perform a probabilistic analysis of the subset sum problem and
knapsack problem, giving theoretical evidence that rollout algorithms perform
strictly better than their base policies. Using a stochastic model from the
existing literature, we analyze two rollout methods that we refer to as the
consecutive rollout and exhaustive rollout, both of which employ a simple
greedy base policy. For the subset sum problem, we prove that after only a
single iteration of the rollout algorithm, both methods yield at least a 30%
reduction in the expected gap between the solution value and capacity, relative
to the base policy. Analogous results are shown for the knapsack problem.

the jet formation model. The most attractive scenario for the origin of such a
large scale field is the advection of the field by the gas in the accretion
disk from the interstellar medium or a companion star. However, it is realized
that outward diffusion of the accreted field is fast compared to the inward
accretion velocity in a geometrically thin accretion disk if the value of the
Prandtl number Pm is around unity. In this work, we revisit this problem
considering the angular momentum of the disk is removed predominantly by the
magnetically driven outflows. The radial velocity of the disk is significantly
increased due to the presence of the outflows. Using a simplified model for the
vertical disk structure, we find that even moderately weak fields can cause
sufficient angular momentum loss via a magnetic wind to balance outward
diffusion. There are two equilibrium points, one at low field strengths
corresponding to a plasma-beta at the midplane of order several hundred, and
one for strong accreted fields, beta~1. We surmise that the first is relevant
for the accretion of weak, possibly external, fields through the outer parts of
the disk, while the latter one could explain the tendency, observed in full 3D
numerical simulations, of strong flux bundles at the centers of disk to stay
confined in spite of strong MRI turbulence surrounding them.

sample of 74 galaxies located in 23 Hickson Compact Groups, chosen to be at a

regions) in 14 galaxies (~20%), with 8 galaxies having extreme values of L(H2
S(0)-S(3))/L(7.7micron PAH), in excess of 0.07. Such emission has been seen
previously in the compact group HCG 92 (Stephan's Quintet), and was shown to be
associated with the dissipation of mechanical energy associated with a
large-scale shock caused when one group member collided, at high velocity, with
tidal debris in the intragroup medium. Similarly, shock excitation or turbulent
heating is likely responsible for the enhanced H2 emission in the compact group
galaxies, since other sources of heating (UV or X-ray excitation from star
formation or AGN) are insufficient to account for the observed emission. The
group galaxies fall predominantly in a region of mid-infrared color-color space
identified by previous studies as being connected to rapid transformations in
HCG galaxy evolution. Furthermore, the majority of H2-enhanced galaxies lie in
the optical ""green valley"" between the blue cloud and red-sequence, and are
primarily early-type disk systems. We suggest that H2-enhanced systems may
represent a specific phase in the evolution of galaxies in dense environments

  An explicit formula for this function is proved.
  In some particular cases, simpler explicit formuls are derived. We also
derive a formula for the number of (0,1)-matrices, having a fixed number of
1's, and having no zero rows and zero columns.
  Further, we show that our function satisfies several recurrence relations.
  The relationship of our counting function with different classes of integers
is then examined. These classes include: different kind of figurate numbers,
the number of points on the surface of a square pyramid, the magic constants,
the truncated square numbers, the coefficients of the Chebyshev polynomials,
the Catalan numbers, the Dellanoy numbers, the Sulanke numbers, the numbers of
the coordination sequences, and the number of the crystal ball sequences of a
cubic lattice.
  In the last part of the paper, we prove that several configurations are
counted by our function. Some of these are: the number of spanning subgraphs of
the complete bipartite graph, the number of square containing in a square, the
number of coloring's of points on a line, the number of divisors of some
particular numbers, the number of all parts in the compositions of an integer,
the numbers of the weak compositions of integers, and the number of particular
lattice paths.
  We conclude by counting the number of possible moves of the rook, bishop, and
queen on a chessboard.
  The most statements in the paper are provided by bijective proofs in terms of
insets, which are defined in the paper. With this we want to show that
different configurations may be counted by the same method.

the energy and minimizes the lifetime of event sources while they are
constantly transmitting for data aggregation in future WSNs. We use the term
Decentralized Lifetime-Minimizing Tree (DLMT) to denote this tree. DLMT
features in nodes with higher energy tend to be chosen as data aggregating
parents so that the time to detect the first broken tree link can be extended
and less energy is involved in tree maintenance. In addition, by constructing
the tree in such a way, the protocol is also able to reduce the frequency of
tree reconstruction, minimizes the amount of data loss, minimizes the delay
during data collection and preserves the energy. Forwarded directed Diffusion
protocol is chosen as the routing platform.

quantum $SU(2)$ Chern-Simons theory describing QIH dynamics, and the number of
punctures $(N)$ produced by the bulk spin network edges piercing the isolated
horizon (which act as pointlike sources for the Chern- Simons fields). We
demonstrate that the microcanonical entropy of macroscopic (both parameters
assuming very large values) QIHs can be obtained directly from the microstates
of this Chern-Simons theory, using standard statistical mechanical methods,
without having to additionally postulate the horizon as an ideal gas of
punctures, or incorporate any additional classical or semi-classical input from
general relativity vis-a-vis the functional dependence of the IH mass on its
area, or indeed, without having to restrict to any special class of spins.

Barbero-Immirzi parameter to take any real and positive value depending on the

transverse force on a vortex and the vortex mass. The transverse force from
free bulk quasiparticles on the vortex, both in the Bose and the Fermi liquid,
originates from the Aharonov--Bohm effect. However, in the Fermi liquid one
should take into account peculiarities of the Aharonov--Bohm effect for BCS
quasiparticles described by two-component spinor wave functions. There is no
connection between the transverse force (either from free bulk quasiparticles
or from vortex-core bound quasiparticles) and the spectral flow in the vortex
core in superfluid Fermi liquid, in contrast to widely known claims. In fact,
there is no steady spectral flow in the core of the moving vortex, and the
analogy with the Andreev bound states in the SNS junction, where the spectral
flow is really possible, is not valid in this respect.
  The role of the backflow on the vortex mass is clarified. The backflow is an
inevitable consequence of a mismatch between the currents inside and outside
the vortex core and restores the conservation of the particle number (charge)
violated by this mismatch. In the Fermi liquid the backflow compensates the
current through the core bound states, which is a source of the vortex mass
(the Kopnin mass). This results in renormalization of the Kopnin vortex mass by
a numerical factor.

and nanotubes made out of various conjugated polymers attract attention of the

this work we present a theoretical analysis of electron transport in polymer
nanofibers assuming them to be in conducting state. We treat a conducting
polymer as a network of metallic-like grains embedded in poorly conducting
environment, which consists of randomly distributed polymeric chains. We
analyze the contribution from intergrain electron resonance tunneling via
intermediate states localized on the polymeric chains between the grains.
Correspondingly, we apply the quantum theory of conduction in mesoscopic
systems to analyze this transport mechanism. We show that the contribution of
resonance electron tunneling to the intergrain electron transport may be
predominating, as follows from experiments on the electrical characterization
of single polyaniline nanofibers. We study the effect of temperature on the
transport characteristics. We represent the thermal environment as a phonon
bath coupled to the intermediate state, which provides electron tunneling
between the metallic-like grains. Using the Buttiker model within the
scattering matrix formalism combined with the nonequilibrium Green's functions
technique, we show that temperature dependencies of both current and
conductance associated with the intergrain electron tunneling, differ from
those typical for other conduction mechanisms in conducting polymers. Also, we
demonstrate that under certain conditions the phonon bath may cause suppression
of the original intermediate state accompanied by emergence of new states for
electron tunneling. The temperature dependencies of the magnitudes of the peaks
in the transmission corresponding to these new states are analyzed.

determine the extent to which side chain flexibility is involved in ligand
binding, a knowledge-based approach was taken. A database composed of examples
of protein structures in the presence or absence of a given ligand is used to
analyze which side chains undergo side chain conformational changes. Such an
analysis has determined that up to 40% of binding site do not present side
chain conformational changes. A total of three residues undergoing side chain
conformational changes encompass approximately 85% of the binding sites
studied. When analyzing the propensities of different amino acids to undergo
side chain conformational changes we find that there are considerable
differences between different amino acids. A support vector machine learning
approach was used to create a classifier system utilizing information about the
solvent accessible area as well as flexibility scale value of each specific
side chain to be predicted together with its neighboring side chains. An
accuracy level of 70% is reached using this approach. The fact that a small
number of residues undergo side chain conformational changes in the majority of
binding sites makes it feasible to introduce side chain flexibility in docking
simulations. An algorithm has been developed for introducing side chain
flexibility utilizing a hybrid genetic-algorithm/exhaustive-search procedure
and a surface complementarity based scoring function. This approach is
implemented in the software tool FlexAID. FlexAID utilizes a rotamer library to
create alternative conformations for a list of residues that are exhaustively
searched during the docking simulation. The performance of FlexAID in rigid
local as well as global simulations falls in the 70-80% range for both local

representation for QS functions using convex analysis, revealing the structure
necessary for a QS function to be interpreted as the negative log of a
probability density, and providing the foundation for statistical
interpretation and analysis of QS loss functions. For a subclass of QS
functions called piecewise linear quadratic (PLQ) penalties, we also develop
efficient numerical estimation schemes. These components form a flexible
statistical modeling framework for a variety of learning applications, together
with a toolbox of efficient numerical methods for inference. In particular, for
PLQ densities, interior point (IP) methods can be used. IP methods solve
nonsmooth optimization problems by working directly with smooth systems of
equations characterizing their optimality. The efficiency of the IP approach
depends on the structure of particular applications. We consider the class of
dynamic inverse problems using Kalman smoothing, where the aim is to
reconstruct the state of a dynamical system with known process and measurement
models starting from noisy output samples. In the classical case, Gaussian
errors are assumed in the process and measurement models. The extended
framework allows arbitrary PLQ densities to be used, and the proposed IP
approach solves the generalized Kalman smoothing problem while maintaining the
linear complexity in the size of the time series, just as in the Gaussian case.
This extends the computational efficiency of classic algorithms to a much
broader nonsmooth setting, and includes many recently proposed robust and
sparse smoothers as special cases.

For analysis of tunneling probability for birth of an asymptotically deSitter,
inflationary Universe as a function of the radiation energy a new definition of
a ""free"" wave propagating inside strong fields is proposed. On such a basis,
tunneling boundary condition is corrected, penetrability and reflection
concerning to the barrier are calculated in fully quantum stationary approach.
For the first time non-zero interference between the incident and reflected
waves has been taken into account which turns out to play important role inside
cosmological potentials and could be explained by non-locality of barriers in
quantum mechanics. Inside whole region of energy of radiation the tunneling
probability for the birth of the inflationary Universe is found to be close to
its value obtained in semiclassical approach. The reflection from the barrier
is determined for the first time (which is essentially differs on 1 at the
energy of radiation close to the barrier height). The proposed method could be
easily generalized on the cosmological models with the barriers of arbitrary
shape, that has been demonstrated for the FRW-model with included Chaplygin
gas. Result is stable for variations of the studied barriers, accuracy are
found to be 11--18 digits for all coefficients and energies below the barrier
height.

high energies, a striking phenomenon known as spontaneous dimensional reduction
(SDR). We construct an effective electroweak theory based on the standard model
(SM) and incorporate the TeV-scale SDR, which exhibits good high energy
behavior and ensures the unitarity of weak gauge boson scattering. This also
provides a natural solution to the hierarchy problem in the presence of scalar
Higgs boson. We demonstrate that this model predicts unitary longitudinal weak
boson scattering, and can be discriminated from the conventional 4d SM by the
WW scattering experiments at the CERN LHC.

topological qubit and the quantized motion of a magnetized nanomechanical
resonator. This coupling is achieved by attaching an array of magnetic tips to
a namomechanical resonator under a quantum phase controller which coherently
controls the energy gap of a topological qubit. Combined with single-qubit
rotations the strong coupling enables arbitrary unitary transformations on the
hybrid system of topological and mechanical qubits and may pave the way for the
quantum information transfer between topological and optical qubits. Numerical
simulations show that quantum state transfer and entanglement distributing
between the topological and mechanical qubits may be accomplished with high
fidelity.

  1, no. 5,2009",,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To enable data aggregation among the event sources in wireless sensor
networks and to reduce the communication cost there is a need to establish a
coveraged tree structure inside any given event region to allow data reports to
be aggregated at a single processing point prior to transmission to the
network. In this paper we propose a novel technique to create one such tree
which maximizes the lifetime of the event sources while they are constantly
transmitting for data aggregation. We use the term Centralized Lifetime
Maximizing Tree (CLMT) to denote this tree. CLMT features with identification
of bottleneck node among the given set of nodes. This node collects the data
from every other node via routes with the highest branch energy subject to
condition loop is not created. By constructing tree in such a way, protocol is
able to reduce the frequency of tree reconstruction, minimize the delay and
maximize the functional lifetime of source nodes by minimizing the additional
energy involved in tree reconstruction.

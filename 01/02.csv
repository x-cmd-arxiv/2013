suffix-prefix matching of highly periodic strings. In this paper, we extend the
concept of the Lyndon word to two dimensions. We introduce the 2D Lyndon word
and use it to capture 2D horizontal periodicity of a matrix in which each row

  We present several algorithms that compute the 2D Lyndon word that represents

evanescent. A lossless DNG slab retains the single-interface perfect-lensing

slab lens performance rapidly deteriorates under such conditions due to

occupied by an individual which is characterized by one of two possible types,

thought of as a producer and consumer of resources, the new type at each update
is chosen at random from a certain interaction neighborhood according to
probabilities proportional to the ability of the neighbors to consume the

complete qualitative picture of the phase diagram of the spatial model, our
results indicate that the nonspatial deterministic mean-field approximation of

the inclusion of space also translates into a significant reduction of the

We have found that in both dimensions in the anisotropic and partially
anisotropic spin systems at zero temperatures, all types of entanglement decay
as the magnetic field increases but are sustained with very small magnitudes at
high field values. Also we found that for the same systems, the threshold
temperatures of the nearest neighbour (nn) BEs are higher than both of the
next-to-nearest neighbour BEs and MEs and the three of them increase
monotonically with the magnetic field strength. Thus, as the temperature
increases, the ME and the far parts BE of the system become more fragile to
thermal excitations compared to the nn BE. For the isotropic system, all types
of entanglement and threshold temperatures vanish at the same exact small value
of the magnetic field. We emphasise the major role played by both the
properties of the ground state of the system and the energy gap in controlling
the characteristics of the entanglement and threshold temperatures. In
addition, we have shown how an inserted magnetic impurity can be used to
preserve all types of entanglement and enhance their threshold temperatures.
Furthermore, we found that the quantum effects in the spin systems can be

$\alpha_1=1$. On the other hand we also prove that no randomized memoryless
algorithm can have competitive ratio better than $\alpha_k$.
  To prove the upper bound of $\alpha_k$ we develop a framework to bound from
above the competitive ratio of any randomized memoryless algorithm for this
problem. The key technical contribution is a method for working with potential
functions defined implicitly as the solution of a linear system. The result is
robust in the sense that a small change in the probabilities used by the
algorithm results in a small change in the upper bound on the competitive
ratio. The above result has two important implications. Firstly this yields an
$\alpha_k$-competitive memoryless algorithm for the weighted $k$-server problem
on uniform spaces. This is the first competitive algorithm for $k>2$ which is
memoryless. Secondly, this helps us prove that the Harmonic algorithm, which
chooses probabilities in inverse proportion to weights, has a competitive ratio
of $k\alpha_k$.

located on a connected graph interact through successive conversations to
bootstrap a common name for a given object. Initially, all the players use the
same word B except for one bilingual individual who also uses word A. Both
words are attributed a fitness, which measures how often players speak
depending on the words they use and how often each word is pronounced by
bilingual individuals. The limiting behavior depends on a single parameter: phi
= the ratio of the fitness of word A to the fitness of word B. The main
objective is to determine whether word A can invade the system and become the
new linguistic convention. In the mean-field approximation, invasion of word A
is successful if and only if phi > 3, a result that we also prove for the
process on complete graphs relying on the optimal stopping theorem for
supermartingales and random walk estimates. In contrast, for the process on the
one-dimensional lattice, word A can invade the system whenever phi > 1.053
indicating that the probability of invasion and the critical value for phi
strongly depend on the degree of the graph. The system on regular lattices in
higher dimensions is also studied by comparing the process with percolation

local population is subject to a strong Allee effect. The model is obtained by
using the framework of interacting particle systems to extend a stochastic
two-patch model that has been recently introduced by Kang and the author. The
main objective is to understand the effect of the geometry of the network of
interactions, which represents potential migrations between patches, on the
long-term behavior of the metapopulation. In the limit as the number of patches
tends to infinity, there is a critical value for the Allee threshold below
which the metapopulation expands and above which the metapopulation goes
extinct. Spatial simulations on large regular graphs suggest that this critical
value strongly depends on the initial distribution when the degree of the
network is large whereas the critical value does not depend on the initial
distribution when the degree is small. Looking at the system starting with a
single occupied patch on the complete graph and on the ring, we prove
analytical results that support this conjecture. From an ecological
perspective, these results indicate that, upon arrival of an alien species
subject to a strong Allee effect to a new area, though dispersal is necessary
for its expansion, strong long range dispersal drives the population toward
extinction.

deformable body are obtained from a variational condition, by applying Green's
formula in the whole space and on the Riemannian surfaces. The surface
equations are similar to the Cauchy's equations for the volume, but involve a
special definition of the 'divergence' (tensorial product of the covariant
derivatives on the surface and the whole space). The normal component of the
divergence equation generalizes the Laplace's equation for a fluid-fluid
interface. Assuming that Green's formula remains valid at the contact line
(despite the singularity), two equations are obtained at this line. The first
one expresses that the fluid-fluid surface tension is equilibrated by the two
surface stresses (and not by the volume stresses of the body) and suggests a
finite displacement at this line (contrary to the infinite-displacement
solution of classical elasticity, in which the surface properties are not taken
into account). The second equation represents a strong modification of Young's
capillary equation. The validity of Green's formula and the existence of a
finite-displacement solution are justified with an explicit example of
finite-displacement solution in the simple case of a half-space elastic solid
bounded by a plane. The solution satisfies the contact line equations and its
elastic energy is finite (whereas it is infinite for the classical elastic
solution). The strain tensor components generally have different limits when
approaching the contact line under different directions. Although Green's
formula cannot be directly applied, because the stress tensor components do not
belong to the Sobolev space H1(V), it is shown that this formula remains valid.
As a consequence, there is no contribution of the volume stresses at the
contact line. The validity of Green's formula plays a central role in the
theory.

electrically neutral and weakly interacting). The SM assumes that they are
massless. Therefore, particle physicists are now exploring new physics beyond
the SM. There is strong anticipation that we are about to unravel it, in the
form of new matter and/or forces, at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), presently
running at CERN. We discuss a minimal extension of the SM, based on a somewhat
larger version of its symmetry structure and particle content, that can
naturally explain the existence of neutrino masses while also predicting novel
signals accessible at the LHC, including a light Higgs boson, as evidenced by
current data.

bias of CMI and develop a randomization significance test of $I_c(m)$, where
the randomized symbol sequences are formed by random permutation of the

for increasing $m$ and the Markov chain order is estimated by the last order

CMI-testing on Monte Carlo simulations and compare it to the Akaike and
Bayesian information criteria, the maximal fluctuation method (Peres-Shields

$\phi$-divergence. The order criterion of CMI-testing turns out to be superior
for orders larger than one, but its effectiveness for large orders depends on
data availability. In view of the results from the simulations, we interpret

spatial systems which is obtained from the framework of interacting particle
systems by replacing the traditional graphical structure that defines the
network of interactions with a structure of hypergraph. This new perspective is
more appropriate to define stochastic spatial processes in which large blocks
of vertices may flip simultaneously, which is then applied to define a spatial
version of the Galam's majority rule model. In our spatial model, each vertex
of the lattice has one of two possible competing opinions, say opinion 0 and
opinion 1, as in the popular voter model. Hyperedges are updated at rate one,
which results in all the vertices in the hyperedge changing simultaneously
their opinion to the majority opinion of the hyperedge. In the case of a tie in
hyperedges with even size, a bias is introduced in favor of type 1, which is
motivated by the principle of social inertia. Our analytical results along with
simulations and heuristic arguments suggest that, in any spatial dimensions and
when the set of hyperedges consists of the collection of all n x ... x n blocks
of the lattice, opinion 1 wins when n is even while the system clusters when n
is odd, which contrasts with results about the voter model in high dimensions
for which opinions coexist. This is fully proved in one dimension while the
rest of our analysis focuses on the cases when n = 2 and n = 3 in two
dimensions.

atomistic level. The rescaled diffusion coefficient obtained from mesoscale
simulations of coarse-grained cis-1,4-Polybutadiene melts shows good agreement
with data from united atom simulations performed by Tsolou et al. The derived
monomer friction coefficient is used as an input to the theory for cooperative
dynamics that describes the internal dynamics of a polymer moving in a
transient regions of slow cooperative motion in a liquid of macromolecules.
Theoretically predicted time correlation functions show good agreement with

available. The theory provides, from data of mesoscale simulations of soft
spheres, the correct atomistic-level dynamics, having as solo input static
quantities.

  conference",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is one of the important fields in image
processing and pattern recognition domain. Handwritten character recognition
has always been a challenging task. Only a little work can be traced towards
the recognition of handwritten characters for the south Indian languages.
Kannada is one such south Indian language which is also one of the official
language of India. Accurate recognition of Kannada characters is a challenging
task because of the high degree of similarity between the characters. Hence,
good quality features are to be extracted and better classifiers are needed to
improve the accuracy of the OCR for Kannada characters. This paper explores the
effectiveness of feature extraction method like run length count (RLC) and
directional chain code (DCC) for the recognition of handwritten Kannada
numerals. In this paper, a classifier fusion method is implemented to improve
the recognition rate. For the classifier fusion, we have considered K-nearest
neighbour (KNN) and Linear classifier (LC). The novelty of this method is to
achieve better accuracy with few features using classifier fusion approach.
Proposed method achieves an average recognition rate of 96%.

complete orientation-dependence of interfacial free energies in solid-state
crystalline systems. We illustrate the method with an application to
precipitates in the Al-Ti alloy system. The method combines the cluster
expansion formalism in its most general form (to model the system's energetics)
with the inversion of the well-known Wulff construction (to recover interfacial
energies from equilibrium precipitate shapes). Although the inverse Wulff
construction only provides the relative magnitude of the various interfacial
free energies, absolute free energies can be recovered from a calculation of a
single, conveniently chosen, planar interface. The method is able to account
for essentially all sources of entropy (arising from phonons, bulk point
defects, as well as interface roughness) and is thus able to transparently
handle both atomically smooth and rough interfaces. The approach expresses the
resulting orientation-dependence of the interfacial properties using
symmetry-adapted bases for general orientation-dependent quantities. As a
by-product, this paper thus provides a simple and general method to generate
such basis functions, which prove useful in a variety of other applications,
for instance to represent the anisotropy of the so-called constituent strain
elastic energy.

Degasperis-Procesi equation (DP) is an important example of an integrable PDE
exhibiting wave breaking in the peakon sector thus affording an interpretation
of wave breaking as a mechanical collision of particles. In this paper we set
up a general formalism in which to study collisions of DP peakons and apply it,
as an illustration, to a detailed study of three colliding peakons. It is shown
that peakons can collide only in pairs, no triple collisions are allowed and at
the collision a shockpeakon is created. We also show that the initial
configuration of peakon-antipeakon pairs is nontrivially correlated with the
spectral properties of an accompanying non-selfadjoint boundary value problem.
In particular if peakons or antipeakons are bunched up on one side relative to
a remaining antipeakon or peakon then the spectrum is real and simple. Even
though the spectrum is in general complex the existence of a global solution in
either time direction dynamics is shown to imply the reality of the spectrum of

A key
open question dealing with understanding their evolution is: How various
preferential linking mechanisms produce networks with different features? In
this paper we first empirically study preferential linking phenomena in an
evolving online social network, find and validate the linear preference. We
propose an analyzable model which captures the real growth process of the
network and reveals the underlying mechanism dominating its evolution.
Furthermore based on preferential linking we propose a generalized model
reproducing the evolution of online social networks, present unified analytical
results describing network characteristics for 27 preference scenarios, and
explore the relation between preferential linking mechanism and network
features. We find that within the framework of preferential linking analytical
degree distributions can only be the combinations of finite kinds of functions
which are related to rational, logarithmic and inverse tangent functions, and
extremely complex network structure will emerge even for very simple sublinear
preferential linking. This work not only provides a verifiable origin for the
emergence of various network characteristics in social networks, but bridges
the micro individuals' behaviors and the global organization of social
networks.

X-ray source population (in most of the cases likely to be background active
galactic nuclei) detected towards the target. A cross correlation with the
available databases allowed us to find a source that may be associated with a
variable star belonging to the galaxy. We also searched for X-ray sources in
the vicinity of the Fornax globular clusters GC 3 and GC 4 and found two
sources probably associated with the respective clusters. The deep X-ray
observation was also suitable for the search of the intermediate-mass black
hole (of mass $\simeq 10^{4}$ M$_{\odot}$) expected to be hosted in the center
of the galaxy. In the case of Fornax, this search is extremely difficult since
the galaxy centroid of gravity is poorly constrained because of the large
asymmetry observed in the optical surface brightness. Since we cannot firmly
establish the existence of an X-ray counterpart of the putative black hole, we
put constraints only on the accretion parameters. In particular, we found that
the corresponding upper limit on the accretion efficiency, with respect to the
Eddington luminosity, is as low as a few $10^{-5}$.

Mathematically, we study framed flat PGL(K,C)-connections on a large class of
3-manifolds M with boundary. We define a space L_K(M) of framed flat
connections on the boundary of M that extend to M. Our goal is to understand an
open part of L_K(M) as a Lagrangian in the symplectic space of framed flat
connections on the boundary, and as a K_2-Lagrangian, meaning that the
K_2-avatar of the symplectic form restricts to zero. We construct an open part
of L_K(M) from data assigned to a hypersimplicial K-decomposition of an ideal
triangulation of M, generalizing Thurston's gluing equations in 3d hyperbolic
geometry, and combining them with the cluster coordinates for framed flat
PGL(K)-connections on surfaces. Using a canonical map from the complex of
configurations of decorated flags to the Bloch complex, we prove that any
generic component of L_K(M) is K_2-isotropic if the boundary satisfies some
topological constraints (Theorem 4.2). In some cases this implies that L_K(M)
is K_2-Lagrangian. For general M, we extend a classic result of Neumann-Zagier
on symplectic properties of PGL(2) gluing equations to reduce the
K_2-Lagrangian property to a combinatorial claim.
  Physically, we use the symplectic properties of K-decompositions to construct
3d N=2 superconformal field theories T_K[M] corresponding (conjecturally) to
the compactification of K M5-branes on M. This extends known constructions for
K=2. Just as for K=2, the theories T_K[M] are described as IR fixed points of
abelian Chern-Simons-matter theories. Changes of triangulation (2-3 moves) lead
to abelian mirror symmetries that are all generated by the elementary duality
between N_f=1 SQED and the XYZ model. In the large K limit, we find evidence
that the degrees of freedom of T_K[M] grow cubically in K.

the surface of these bodies due to the lack of atmosphere, and the
interplanetary magnetic field passes through the obstacle relatively
undisturbed because the bodies are assumed to be non-conductive. Since the
solar wind is absorbed by the body, a wake is created behind the object. This
wake is gradually filled by solar wind plasma downstream of the body, through
thermal expansion and the resulting ambipolar electric field, along the
magnetic field lines. Here we study this plasma expansion into a vacuum using a
hybrid plasma solver. In the hybrid approximation, ions are treated as
particles, and electrons as a massless fluid. We also derive corresponding one-
and two-dimensional model problems that account for the absorbing obstacle. It
is found that the absorbing obstacle create ion velocity distributions that are
far from the assumed upstream thermal Maxwellian distributions. Such
distributions can give rise to different plasma instabilities that has been
observed in the Lunar wake.

inspired by an intriguing ability of slime molds to both memorize the period of
temperature and humidity variations, and anticipate the next variations to
come, when appropriately trained. Effective circuit models of such behavior are
designed using i) a set of LC-contours with memristive damping, and ii) a
single memcapacitive system-based adaptive contour with memristive damping. We
consider these two approaches in detail by comparing their results and
predictions. Finally, possible biological experiments that would discriminate
between the models are discussed. In this work, we also introduce an effective
description of certain memory circuit elements.

reconstruction error considerably in the case of linearly correlated

quantization of compressed measurements, which is known to introduce correlated
noise, and improvements in reconstruction error compared to ordinary Basis

  AAMAS, 2012",,,,"cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  Travel sharing, i.e., the problem of finding parts of routes which can be
shared by several travellers with different points of departure and
destinations, is a complex multiagent problem that requires taking into account
individual agents' preferences to come up with mutually acceptable joint plans.
In this paper, we apply state-of-the-art planning techniques to real-world
public transportation data to evaluate the feasibility of multiagent planning
techniques in this domain. The potential application value of improving travel
sharing technology has great application value due to its ability to reduce the
environmental impact of travelling while providing benefits to travellers at
the same time. We propose a three-phase algorithm that utilises performant
single-agent planners to find individual plans in a simplified domain first,
then merges them using a best-response planner which ensures resulting
solutions are individually rational, and then maps the resulting plan onto the
full temporal planning domain to schedule actual journeys. The evaluation of
our algorithm on real-world, multi-modal public transportation data for the
United Kingdom shows linear scalability both in the scenario size and in the
number of agents, where trade-offs have to be made between total cost
improvement, the percentage of feasible timetables identified for journeys, and
the prolongation of these journeys. Our system constitutes the first
implementation of strategic multiagent planning algorithms in large-scale
domains and provides insights into the engineering process of translating
general domain-independent multiagent planning algorithms to real-world
applications.

retrieved atmospheric parameters which might be obtained from infrared emission
spectroscopy. We use synthetic observations of hypothetical habitable planets,
constructed with a parametrized atmosphere model, a high-resolution radiative
transfer model and a simplified noise model. Classic statistical tools such as
chi2 statistics and least-square fits were used to analyze the simulated
observations. When adopting the design of currently planned or proposed
exoplanet characterization missions, we find that emission spectroscopy could
provide weak limits on surface conditions of terrestrial planets, hence their
potential habitability. However, these mission designs are unlikely to allow to
characterize the composition of the atmosphere of a habitable planet, even
though CO2 is detected. Upon increasing the signal-to-noise ratios by about a
factor of 2-5 (depending on spectral resolution) compared to current mission
designs, the CO2 content could be characterized to within two orders of
magnitude. The detection of the O3 biosignature remains marginal. The
atmospheric temperature structure could not be constrained. Therefore, a full
atmospheric characterization seems to be beyond the capabilities of such
missions when using only emission spectroscopy during secondary eclipse or
target visits. Other methods such as transmission spectroscopy or orbital
photometry are probably needed in order to give additional constraints and
break degeneracies. (abridged)

N$ specifies the number of states with energy below a given energy eigenstate.
It has been recently proved that, when an isolated quantum mechanical system is
driven out of equilibrium by an external driving, the change in the expectation
of its quantum Hertz entropy cannot be negative, and is null for adiabatic
driving. This is in full agreement with the Clausius principle. Here we test
the behavior of the expectation of the quantum Hertz entropy in the case when
two identical XY spin chains initially at different temperatures are quenched
into a single XY chain. We observed no quantum Hertz entropy decrease. This
finding further supports the statement that the quantum Hertz entropy is a
proper entropy for isolated quantum systems. We further quantify how far the
quenched chain is from thermal equilibrium and the temperature of the closest
equilibrium.

sampling acoustic fields with $n$ microphones for the purpose of reconstructing
this field over a region of interest $\Omega$ contained in a larger domain $D$

$D$ and the boundary conditions on its border are unknown. Our reconstruction

combinations of Fourier-Bessel functions or plane waves. We analyze the
convergence of the least-squares estimates to $u$ using these families of
functions based on the samples $(u(x_i))_{i=1,\dots,n}$. Our analysis describes
the amount of regularization needed to guarantee the convergence of the least

overwhelmed by the mass of the core has been identified, e.g., the core {\small
L183}. In literature, massive cores such as this one are often referred to as
""super-Jeans cores"". As starless cores are perhaps on the cusp of forming
stars, a study of their dynamics will improve our understanding of the
transition from the prestellar to the protostellar phase. In the present work
we use non-magnetic polytropes belonging originally to the family of the
Isothermal sphere. For the purpose, perturbations were applied to individual
polytropes, first by replacing the isothermal gas with a gas that was cold near
the centre of the polytrope and relatively warm in the outer regions, and
second, through a slight compression of the polytrope by raising the external
confining pressure. Using this latter configuration we identify thermodynamic
conditions under which a core is likely to remain starless. In fact, we also
argue that the attribute ""super-Jeans"" is subjective and that these cores do
not formally violate the Jeans stability criterion. On the basis of our test
results we suggest that gas temperature in a star-forming cloud is crucial
towards the formation and evolution of a core. Simulations in this work were
performed using the particle-based Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics algorithm.
However, to establish numerical convergence of the results we suggest similar
tests with a grid-scheme, such as the Adaptive mesh refinement.

  substantial text overlap with arXiv:1301.0549, arXiv:1301.0146",,"10.1088/0031-8949/87/03/038108",,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the framework of the theory of open systems based on completely positive
quantum dynamical semigroups, we give a description of continuous variable
Gaussian R\'enyi-2 (GR2) quantum discord for a system consisting of two
non-interacting non-resonant bosonic modes embedded in a thermal environment.
In the case of both an entangled initial squeezed vacuum state and squeezed
thermal state, GR2 quantum discord has non-negative values for all temperatures
of the environment. We describe also the time evolution of GR2 classical
correlations and GR2 quantum mutual information of the quantum system. All
these quantities tend asymptotically to zero in the long time regime under the
effect of the thermal bath.

structures, being in fact the groupoid counterparts of the inner product notion
originally defined for vectors. These bihomomorphisms, called here the
semi-inner products for groupoids, determine non-negative real valued functions
which fulfill the axioms assumed for a groupoid norm concept [2].

principle of cosmology. With the Planck era as initial conditions and including
the early inflation, we have solved the Einstein-Friedmann equations to
describe the evolution of the universe. The results are: 1) the ratio of the
dark energy density to the vacuum quantum fluctuation energy density is
$\frac{{{\rho }_{de}}}{{{\rho
}_{vac}}}\sim{{(\frac{{{t}_{P}}}{{{T}_{0}}})}^{2}}\sim{{10}^{-122}} $; 2) at
the inflation time ${{t}_{\inf }}={{10}^{-35}}s$, the calculated universe
radiation energy density is $\rho ({{t}_{\inf }})\sim{{10}^{-16}}{{\rho
}_{vac}}$ and the corresponding temperature is ${{E}_{c}}\sim{{10}^{15}}GeV$
consistent with the GUT phase transition temperature; 3) the expanding universe
with vacuum as its environment is a non-equilibrium open system constantly
exchanging energy with vacuum; during its expansion, the Planckons in the
universe lose quantum fluctuation energy and create the cosmic expansion
quanta-cosmons, the energy of cosmons is the lost part of the vacuum quantum
fluctuation energy and contributes to the universe energy with the calculated
value ${{E}_{\cos mos}}={{10}^{22}}{{M}_{\otimes }}{{c}^{2}}$ (where
${{M}_{\otimes }}$ is solar mass); 4) the total energy of the universe, namely
the negative gravity energy plus the positive universe energy is zero; 5) the
negative gravity potential and the gravity acceleration related to the creation
of cosmons are derived with the nature of outward repulsive force, indicating
that the cosmon may be the candidate of the dark energy quantum; 6) both the
initial Planck era solution and the infinite asymptotic solution of the
Einstein-Friedman equations are unstable: the former tends to expand and the
latter tends to shrink, so that the Einstein-Friedman universe will undergo a
cyclic evolution of successive expansion and shrinking.

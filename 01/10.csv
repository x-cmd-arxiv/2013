the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and its
international partners Virgo and KAGRA. Current BNS searches target field
binaries whose orbits will have circularized by radiation reaction before their
gravitational waves enter the Advanced LIGO sensitive band at 15 Hz. It has
been suggested that a population of BNSs may form by n-body interactions near
supermassive black holes or in globular clusters and that these systems may
have non-negligible eccentricity in the Advanced LIGO band. We show that for
BNS systems with total mass of 2.4 (6.0) solar masses, the effect of
eccentricity e < 0.02 (0.05) is negligible and a circular search is effectual
for these binaries. For eccentricities up to e = 0.4, we investigate the
selection bias caused by neglecting eccentricity in BNS searches. If such high
eccentricity systems exist, searches that specifically target eccentric
binaries will be needed in Advanced LIGO and Virgo.

$\rho^ {0}$ electroproduction have the potential to settle the scale for the
onset of color transparency (CT) in vector meson production.
  [Purpose] To compare the data to calculations in a relativistic and
quantum-mechanical Glauber model and to investigate whether they are in
accordance with results including color transparency given that the computation
of $\rho$-nucleus attenuations is subject to some uncertainties.
  [Method] We compute the nuclear transparencies in a multiple-scattering
Glauber model and account for effects stemming from color transparency, from
$\rho$-meson decay, and from short-range correlations (SRC) in the final-state
interactions (FSI).
  [Results] The robustness of the model is tested by comparing the mass
dependence and the hard-scale dependence of the $A(e,e'p)$ nuclear
transparencies with the data. The hard-scale dependence of the $(e,e' \rho ^
{0})$ nuclear transparencies for $^ {12}$C and $^ {56}$Fe are only moderately
affected by SRC and by $\rho^ {0}$-decay.
  [Conclusions] The RMSGA calculations confirm the onset of CT at four-momentum
transfers of a few (GeV/c)$^2$ in $\rho$ meson electroproduction data. A more
precise determination of the scale for the onset of CT is hampered by the lack
of precise input in the FSI and $\rho$-meson decay calculations.

only way to currently validate the picture arising from the most modern

After giving a brief overview of the aforementioned results, we highlight the
impact of fast rotating metal-poor massive stars on the chemical enrichment of
heavy-elements such as Sr and Ba. Indeed, in fast rotating massive stars the

Recently, an interesting new policy design framework for the control problem
called h-MaxWeight has been proposed: h-MaxWeight is a natural generalization
of the famous MaxWeight policy where instead of the quadratic any other
surrogate value function can be applied. Stability of the policy is then
achieved through a perturbation technique. However, stability crucially depends
on parameter choice which has to be adapted in simulations. In this paper we
use a different technique where the required perturbations can be directly
implemented in the weight domain, which we call a scheduling field then.
Specifically, we derive the theoretical arsenal that guarantees universal
stability while still operating close to the underlying cost criterion.
Simulation examples suggest that the new approach to policy synthesis can even
provide significantly higher gains irrespective of any further assumptions on
the network model or parameter choice.

astrolabe in order to study variations on the solar semi-diameter. Till now
more than 20.000 observations were done. The observations taken in the year of
2001 were special because, for the first time, they can be compared with other
equivalent series, and because the Sun passed by a second maximum of its cycle
of activity.
  The observed data were at first selected, by leaving out the values relative
to unsuccessful measurements. We dealt with the errors in the observed values
originating from the instability of the objective prism, which increases the
east values and diminishes the west ones. Then, it was possible to remove the
errors by comparing the East and West series. Next, the observational
conditions were investigated: the air temperature, the Fried's parameter, and
the dispersion on the solar limb adjustment. Their influence on the results was
accounted for. Finally we considered the errors arising from leveling defects,
modeled by a dependence to the azimuth of observation. All the corrections are
smaller than the standard deviation and the mean semi-diameter values stay
unaffected. This means that the series have the same pattern with smaller
deviations. After the correction of the prism instability the East and West
series become more similar, what reinforces that they aim at the same target.
  The corrected series were compared with other observations of solar
semi-diameter from the CERGA, Cote d'Azur Observatory in France and from
Tubitak Observatoty in Antalya, Turkey. The comparison reveals alike features,
which deserve further, detailed study. Also, the series was compared to the
daily mean Sun spots number. It exhibited three maxima along 2001, that
coincide on time with three maxima of the correct series delayed by 50 days.
Again, this requires a further study.

de Janeiro made more than 20000 observations of the Solar Semidiameter. In the
present work similar corrections for the observational results of 2002 and 2003
were determined. Initially, the values have been corrected in function of their
mean quadratic offset to the local trend averages, therefore without modifying
the measured variations. Finally, the values have been corrected for the bias,
using coefficients obtained from the correlation between some observational
parameters and the observational measures.
  Then the total series was compared with series of pointers of the solar
activity. The hypothesis of variation of the semidiameter tied to the solar
activity was examined through the correlations between the different pairs of
pointers. Strong correlations between some pairs were obtained. Next, the same
correlations were obtained now considering time delays of one series in
relation to the other. Several pairs have shown an increase on the correlation,
indicating the presence of a significant phase shift between them. For the pair
solar semidiameter and irradiance the mode of the phase for maximum correlation
was calculated for two distinct cases: either for the complete series of data,
or leaving off the data relative to the epochs of the two summits of the solar
activity cycle. The comparison shows that the solar semidiameter responds
closely to variations of irradiance in the conditions where the peaks of
activity are considered; inversely, it precedes the variations of irradiance,
by at least one hundred days, when the peak values are discarded, thus
indicating the existence of two distinct regimes.
  We also studied how the semidiameter of the Sun varies throughout its
latitudes. It was noted that each band of latitude has a different response,
even so there is a global variation in time.

observations of the Sun. Using the data series it was established the solar
radius variation along that period, as well as determining results about the
change of the solar ellipticity.
  To the work in perspective, the measurements of the solar radius in the past
four centuries are reviewed, followed by a more detailed account of the
contemporaneous measurements.
  The deviations of the observed values from the true values caused by
observational and instrumental effects are studied and the strategies used to
derive the corresponding corrections are shown. The relationships linking the
variation of the semidiameter and the relevant indexes of the solar activity
are analyzed.
  Finally, the time series from Observatorio Nacional was enchained to all the
other similar astrolabe series, from which the data were graciously confided to
this work. Using such much longer combined data set it was established the long
term behavior of the solar semidiameter along the last three solar cycles. The
outcome is a strong correlation to the long period features of the solar
activity described by the annual mean of sunspots count. Putting together the
long term semidiameter variation and other solar evidences we point out the
near approach of a deep minimum of sunspots.

(i.e. hard lag), while the opposite (i.e. soft lag) is observed at high
frequencies. In this paper, we study the lag during flaring and quiescent
periods. We find that the frequency and absolute amplitude of the soft lag is
different during high-flux and low-flux periods. During the low flux intervals,
the soft lag is detected at higher frequencies and with smaller amplitude.
Assuming that the soft lag is associated with the light travel time between
primary and reprocessed emission, this behaviour suggests that the X-ray source
is more compact during low-flux intervals, and irradiates smaller radii of the
accretion disc (likely because of light bending effects). We continue with an
investigation of the lag dependence on energy, and find that isolating the
low-flux periods reveals a strong lag signature at the Fe K line energy,
similar to results found using 1.3 Ms of data on another well known Narrow-Line

connected to experiments on expanding Bose gases and to studies of transverse
localization in nonlinear optical media. In a nonlinear medium the energy of
the wave-packet is stored both in the kinetic and potential parts, and details
of its propagation are to a large extent determined by the transfer from one
form of energy to the other. A theory describing the evolution of the
wave-packet has been formulated in [G. Schwiete and A. Finkelstein, Phys. Rev.

induced by the nonlinearity and derive the corresponding collision integral. We
restrict ourselves to the weakly nonlinear limit, for which disorder scattering
is the dominant scattering mechanism. We find that in the special case of a
white noise impurity potential the mean squared radius in a two-dimensional
system scales linearly with t. This result has previously been obtained in the

within only a few million years, achieve stellar mass segregation for stars
down to a few solar masses, simply because of gravitational two-body
encounters. Since binary systems are, on average, more massive than single
stars, one would expect them to also rapidly mass segregate dynamically.
Contrary to these expectations and based on high-resolution Hubble Space
Telescope observations, we show that the compact, 15-30 Myr-old Large
Magellanic Cloud cluster NGC 1818 exhibits tantalizing hints at the >= 2 sigma
level of significance (> 3 sigma if we assume a power-law secondary-to-primary
mass-ratio distribution) of an increasing fraction of F-star binary systems

cluster center, specifically between the inner 10 to 20"" (approximately
equivalent to the cluster's core and half-mass radii) and the outer 60 to 80"".
If confirmed, this will offer support of the theoretically predicted but thus
far unobserved dynamical disruption processes of the significant population of
'soft' binary systems---with relatively low binding energies compared to the

access to here by virtue of the cluster's unique combination of youth and high

the presence of a mass term which is tuned to zero at the Dirac point. An ideal

fidelity (or equivalently in the logarithmic scaling of the fidelity
susceptibility). Most importantly, there is also a logarithmic correction to
the proposed scaling of the fidelity in the thermodynamic limit which can not
be a priori anticipated from the predicted scaling form. Interestingly, a sharp
dip in the ground state Loschmidt echo is also found to be absent near this

when person's speech flows easily and smoothly. Sounds combine into syllable,
syllables mix together into words and words link into sentences with little
effort. When someone's speech is dysfluent, it is irregular and does not flow
effortlessly. Therefore, a dysfluency is a break in the smooth, meaningful flow
of speech. Stuttering is one such disorder in which the fluent flow of speech
is disrupted by occurrences of dysfluencies such as repetitions, prolongations,
interjections and so on. In this work we have considered three types of
dysfluencies such as repetition, prolongation and interjection to characterize
dysfluent speech. After obtaining dysfluent and fluent speech, the speech
signals are analyzed in order to extract MFCC features. The k-Nearest Neighbor
(k-NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers are used to classify the
speech as dysfluent and fluent speech. The 80% of the data is used for training
and 20% for testing. The average accuracy of 86.67% and 93.34% is obtained for

translocation through a nanopore in the limit where the translocation rate is
sufficiently slow that the polymer maintains a state of conformational
quasi-equilibrium. The system is modeled as a flexible hard-sphere chain that
translocates through a cylindrical hole in a hard flat wall. In some
calculations, the nanopore is connected at one end to a spherical cavity.
Translocation times are measured directly using MC dynamics simulations. For
sufficiently narrow pores, translocation is sufficiently slow that the mean
translocation time scales with polymer length N according to <\tau> \propto
(N-N_p)^2, where N_p is the average number of monomers in the nanopore; this
scaling is an indication of a quasi-static regime in which polymer-nanopore
friction dominates. We use a multiple-histogram method to calculate the
variation of the free energy with Q, a coordinate used to quantify the degree
of translocation. The free energy functions are used with the Fokker-Planck
formalism to calculate translocation time distributions in the quasi-static
regime. These calculations also require a friction coefficient, characterized
by a quantity N_{eff}, the effective number of monomers whose dynamics are
affected by the confinement of the nanopore. This was determined by fixing the
mean of the theoretical distribution to that of the distribution obtained from
MC dynamics simulations. The theoretical distributions are in excellent
quantitative agreement with the distributions obtained directly by the MC
dynamics simulations for physically meaningful values of N_{eff}. The free
energy functions for narrow-pore systems exhibit oscillations with an amplitude
that is sensitive to the nanopore length. Generally, larger oscillation
amplitudes correspond to longer translocation times.

on Bayesian optimization have identified its scaling to high-dimensions as one

REMBO achieves state-of-the-art performance in optimizing the 47 discrete

hydrogen-deficient. Almost all of these H-deficient central stars (CSs) display
spectra with strong carbon and helium lines. Most of them exhibit emission line
spectra resembling those of massive WC stars. Therefore these stars are classed
as CSPNe of spectral type [WC]. Recently, quantitative spectral analysis of two
emission-line CSs, PB 8 and IC 4663, revealed that these stars do not belong to
the [WC] class. Instead PB 8 has been classified as [WN/WC] type and IC 4663 as
[WN] type. In this work we report the spectroscopic identification of another
rare [WN] star, the CS of Abell 48. We performed a spectral analysis of Abell
48 with the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) models for expanding atmospheres. We find
that the expanding atmosphere of Abell 48 is mainly composed of helium (85 per

hydrogen and the enhanced nitrogen abundance make this object different from
the other [WN] star IC 4663. We discuss the possible origin of this atmospheric

a general mechanical response of the vehicle's power-train. Effects of
acceleration-feedback control that were not previously studied are found. For
small acceleration-feedback gain, which produces marginally string-stable
behavior, the reduction of a disturbance (with increasing car number n) is
found to be faster than for the maximum allowable gain. The asymptotic
magnitude of a disturbance is shown to fall off as erf(ct./sq. rt. n) when n
goes to infinity. For gain approaching the lower limit of stability,
oscillations in acceleration associated with a secondary maximum in the
transfer function (as a function of frequency) can occur. A frequency-dependent
gain that reduces the secondary maximum, but does not affect the transfer
function near zero frequency, is proposed. Performance is thereby improved by
elimination of the undesirable oscillations while the rapid disturbance
reduction is retained.

graphene carrier density enables us for the first time to investigate TMF
continuously from the hole to the electron regime and analyze the resulting
focusing fan. Moreover, by applying a transverse electric field to tri-layer
graphene, we use TMF as a ballistic electron spectroscopy method to investigate
controlled changes in the electronic structure of a material. Finally, we
demonstrate that TMF survives in graphene up to 300 K, by far the highest

Particle trapping in local or global pressure maxima in

stages of planet formation. However, finding observational evidence for this
effect is not easy. Recent work suggests that the large ring-shaped outer disks
observed in transition disk sources may in fact be lopsided and constitute
large banana-shaped vortices.
  Aims. We wish to investigate how effective dust can accumulate along the
azimuthal direction. We also want to find out if the size- sorting resulting
from this can produce a detectable signatures at millimeter wavelengths.
  Methods. To keep the numerical cost under control we develop a 1+1D method in
which the azimuthal variations are treated sepa- rately from the radial ones.
The azimuthal structure is calculated analytically for a steady-state between
mixing and azimuthal drift. We derive equilibration time scales and compare the
analytical solutions to time-dependent numerical simulations.
  Results. We find that weak, but long-lived azimuthal density gradients in the
gas can induce very strong azimuthal accumulations of dust. The strength of the
accumulations depends on the P\'eclet number, which is the relative importance
of advection and diffusion. We apply our model to transition disks and our
simulated observations show that this effect would be easily observable with
ALMA and in principle allows to put constraints on the strength of turbulence
and the local gas density.

impact on the distribution of HI in the post-reionization Universe. While this
is a good assumption for the IGM, analytic arguments suggest that local sources
may typically be more important than the background radiation for high column
density absorbers (N_HI > 10^17 /cm^2). We post-process cosmological
simulations with accurate radiation transport to investigate the impact of
local stellar sources on the HI distribution. We demonstrate that the limited
numerical resolution and the simplified treatment of the ISM that are typical
of current cosmological simulations provide significant challenges, but that
many of the problems can be overcome by taking two steps. First, using ISM
particles rather than stellar particles as sources results in a much better
sampling of the source distribution. Second, by rescaling the source
luminosities so that the amount of radiation escaping into the IGM agrees with
that required to produce the observed background, many of the results become
insensitive to errors in the predicted fraction of the radiation that escapes
the immediate vicinity of the sources. By adopting this strategy and by varying
the assumptions about the structure of the unresolved ISM, we conclude that we
can robustly estimate the effect of local sources for column densities N_HI <<
10^21 /cm^2. However, neither the escape fraction of ionizing radiation nor the
effect of local sources on the abundance of N_HI >~ 10^21 systems can be
predicted with confidence. We find that local stellar radiation is unimportant
for N_HI << 10^17, but that it can affect Lyman Limit and DLA systems. For
10^18 < N_HI < 10^21 the impact of local sources increases with redshift. At z
= 5 the abundance of absorbers with N_HI >> 10^17 is substantially reduced, but
at z = 0 the reduction only becomes significant for N_HI >~ 10^21 /cm^2.

typically much larger in the free limit, where the superpotential terms vanish.
We find that the finite N counting of operators in any free quiver theory, with
a product of unitary gauge groups, can be described by associating Young
diagrams and Littlewood-Richardson multiplicities to a simple modification of
the quiver, which we call the split-node quiver. The large N limit leads to a
surprisingly simple infinite product formula for counting gauge invariant
operators, valid for any quiver with bifundamental fields. An orthogonal basis
for the operators, in the finite N CFT inner product, is given in terms of
quiver characters. These are constructed by inserting permutations in the
split-node quivers and intepreting the resulting diagrams in terms of symmetric
group matrix elements and branching coefficients. The fusion coefficients in
the chiral ring - valid both in the UV and in the IR - are computed at finite
N. The derivation follows simple diagrammatic moves on the quiver. The large N
counting and correlators are expressed in terms of topological field theories
on Riemann surfaces obtained by thickening the quiver. The TFTs are based on
symmetric groups and defect observables associated with subgroups play an
important role. We outline the application of the free field results to the
construction of BPS operators in the case of non-zero super-potential.

relativistic jet powered by accretion onto a massive black hole (BH) following
the tidal disruption (TD) of a star. Several mysteries cloud the interpretation
of this event: (1) extreme flaring and `plateau' shape of the X-ray/gamma-ray
light curve during the first 10 days after the gamma-ray trigger; (2)
unexpected rebrightening of the forward shock radio emission months after
trigger; (3) no obvious evidence for jet precession, despite misalignment
typically expected between the angular momentum of the accretion disk and BH;
(4) recent abrupt shut-off in jet X-ray emission after 1.5 years. Here we show
that all of these seemingly disparate mysteries are naturally resolved by one
assumption: the presence of strong magnetic flux Phi threading the BH.
Initially, Phi is weak relative to high fall-back mass accretion rate, Mdot,
and the disk and jets precess about the BH axis = our line of sight. As Mdot
drops, Phi becomes dynamically important and leads to a magnetically-arrested
disk (MAD). MAD naturally aligns disk and jet axis along the BH spin axis, but
only after a violent rearrangement phase (jet wobbling). This explains the
erratic light curve at early times and the lack of precession at later times.
We use our model for Swift J1644+57 to constrain BH and disrupted star
properties, finding that a solar-mass main sequence star disrupted by a
relatively low mass, M~10^5-10^6 Msun, BH is consistent with the data, while a
WD disruption (though still possible) is disfavored. The magnetic flux required
to power Swift J1644+57 is too large to be supplied by the star itself, but it
could be collected from a quiescent `fossil' accretion disk present in the
galactic nucleus prior to the TD. The presence (lack of) of such a fossil disk
could be a deciding factor in what TD events are accompanied by powerful
jets.[abridged]

their bolometric luminosity. Pegase.3 coherently models the reprocessing of the
stellar luminosity to dust emission, allowing to build UV to IR-submm libraries
by types. These templates allow to predict SEDs at redshifts z in the
observer's frame by using z=0 templates corrected for cosmology and evolution.
Our best fits are a sum of two distinct evolving stellar populations: i) a very
massive starburst observed ~30 Myrs after formation from optical and far-IR
peaks ii) a significantly older (~1Gyr old) massive early-type population
revealed from mid-IR Spitzer data. The AGN emission fits a roughly thermal
model. These results confirm that many of the stellar populations in high-z
radio galaxies were already formed by massive (a few thousands of billion solar
masses) starbursts at z=4, confirming the previous K-z diagram interpretation.
Gas-rich mergers and/or jet-cloud interactions are favored for triggering the
intense star formation, possibly in relation with massive super black holes of
these radio galaxies. These multiple stellar populations may be a generic
feature of the luminous infrared radio galaxy population as a whole and
strongly constrain mass accumulation and galaxy formation models.

co-adding line-of-sight spectra after removing the rotational velocity to
produce an average, global \hi{} line profile. These ""superprofiles"" are
composed of a central narrow peak (~6-10 km/s) with higher-velocity wings to
either side that contain ~10-15% of the total flux. The superprofiles are all
very similar, indicating a universal global HI profile for dwarf galaxies. We
compare characteristics of the superprofiles to various galaxy properties, such
as mass and measures of star formation (SF), with the assumption that the
superprofile represents a turbulent peak with energetic wings to either side.
We use these quantities to derive average scale heights for the sample
galaxies. When comparing to physical properties, we find that the velocity
dispersion of the central peak is correlated with $<\Sigma_\mathrm{HI}>$. The
fraction of mass and characteristic velocity of the high velocity wings are
correlated with measures of SF, consistent with the picture that SF drives
surrounding HI to higher velocities. While gravitational instabilities provide
too little energy, the SF in the sample galaxies does provide enough energy
through supernovae, with realistic estimates of the coupling efficiency, to
produce the observed superprofiles.

also all continuous spatially heterogeneous stationary solutions, and
consequently, there exist no stable Turing patterns in such

the derivation of the parameters (age, mass, and extinction) of unresolved star

  Aims. We develop a method to simulate stochasticity and degeneracies, and to
investigate their influence on the accuracy of derived physical parameters.
Then we apply it to star cluster samples of M31 and M33 galaxies.
  Methods. Age, mass and extinction of observed star clusters are derived by
comparing their broad-band UBVRI integrated magnitudes to the magnitudes of a
large grid of star cluster models with fixed metallicity Z=0.008. Masses of
stars for a cluster model are randomly sampled from the initial mass function.
Models of star clusters from the model grid, which have all of their magnitudes
located within 3 observational errors from the magnitudes of the observed
cluster, are selected for the computation of its age, mass, and extinction.
  Results. In the case of the M31 galaxy, the extinction range is wide and the
age-extinction degeneracy is strong for a fraction of its clusters. Because of
a narrower extinction range, the age-extinction degeneracy is weaker for the
M33 clusters. By using artificial cluster sample, we show that age-extinction
degeneracy can be reduced significantly if the range of intrinsic extinction
within the host galaxy is narrow.

the photon is then subjected to an orthogonal polarization measurement-e.g.,
horizontal vs vertical-the photon's preparation cannot be fully expressed in
the outcome: a binary outcome cannot reveal the value of a continuous variable.
However, a stream of identically prepared photons can do much better. To
quantify this effect, one can compute the mutual information between the angle
of polarization and the observed frequencies of occurrence of ""horizontal"" and
""vertical."" Remarkably, one finds that the quantum-mechanical rule for
computing probabilities--Born's rule--maximizes this mutual information
relative to other conceivable probability rules. However, the maximization is
achieved only because linear polarization can be modeled with a real state
space; the argument fails when one considers the full set of complex states.
This result generalizes to higher dimensional Hilbert spaces: in every case,
one finds that information is transferred optimally from preparation to
measurement in the real-vector-space theory but not in the complex theory.
Attempts to modify the statement of the problem so as to see a similar
optimization in the standard complex theory are not successful (with one
limited exception). So it seems that this optimization should be regarded as a

with only real roots for which a central limit theorem holds if and only if the

(SU) to learn the null space of the interference channel to the Primary User
(PU) without burdening the PU with any knowledge or explicit cooperation with
the SU.
  The knowledge of this null space enables the SU to transmit in the same band
simultaneously with the PU by utilizing separate spatial dimensions than the
PU. Specifically, the SU transmits in the null space of the interference
channel to the PU. We present a new algorithm, called the One-Bit Null Space
Learning Algorithm (OBNSLA), in which the SU learns the PU's null space by
observing a binary function that indicates whether the interference it inflicts
on the PU has increased or decreased in comparison to the SU's previous
transmitted signal. This function is obtained by listening to the PU
transmitted signal or control channel and extracting information from it about
whether the PU's Signal to Interference plus Noise power Ratio (SINR) has
increased or decreased.
  In addition to introducing the OBNSLA, this paper provides a thorough
convergence analysis of this algorithm. The OBNSLA is shown to have a linear
convergence rate and an asymptotic quadratic convergence rate. Finally, we
derive bounds on the interference that the SU inflicts on the PU as a function
of a parameter determined by the SU. This lets the SU control the maximum level
of interference, which enables it to protect the PU completely blindly with
minimum complexity. The asymptotic analysis and the derived bounds also apply
to the recently proposed Blind Null Space Learning Algorithm.

from conventional classifiers that are designed for a low overall

Although there are a few reported methods addressing this requirement in the

provide such an algorithm here. We show that a special case of the biased

based on permutation codes to general codes and introduce an additional new
parameter that more precisely captures a code's performance against permanent
narrowband noise. As a result, we define a new class of codes, namely,
equitable symbol weight codes, which are optimal with respect to this measure.

by the application of a heat flow. The effect has been calculated theoretically
by Jia et al. in 2011. It is found to require large temperature gradients in
the order of Kelvins across an ultra thin MgO barrier. In this paper, we
present results on the fabrication and the characterization of magnetic tunnel
junctions with 3 monolayer thin MgO barriers. The quality of the interfaces at
different growth conditions is studied quantitatively via high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy imaging. We demonstrate tunneling magneto
resistance ratios of up to 55% to 64% for 3 to 4 monolayer barrier thickness.
Magnetic tunnel junctions with perpendicular magnetization anisotropy show
spin-transfer torque switching with a critical current of 0.2 MA/cm$^2$. The
thermally generated torque is calculated ab initio using the
Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker and non-equilibrium Green's function method. Temperature
gradients generated from femtosecond laser pulses were simulated using COMSOL,
revealing gradients of 20 K enabling thermal spin-transfer-torque switching.

  Let K[1...n] be an array of n integer keys each in the range [1,n], and it is

helical structure at all frequencies. The ridge-line of the emission in the jet
coincides at all frequencies and epochs, within the errors. We conclude that
the helicity is a real, physical structure. Small differences between epochs
reveal wave-like motion of the ridge-line transversal to the jet propagation
axis. These transversal motions are measured to be superluminal. This
unphysical result could correspond to a possible small amplitude oscillation of
the ridge-line at the radio-core and to large errors in the determination of
the positions. In addition, higher resolution images at 15 GHz show that the
ridge-line does not coincide exactly with the centre of the radio jet. At
arc-second scales, this powerful jet shows non-collimated, irregular structure
and a lack of a hot-spot. Following this collection of evidence, we conclude
that the ridge-line could be related to a pressure maximum within the jet
cross-section, associated with the observed helical pattern that could lead to
jet disruption at longer scales. We discuss the implications regarding the
nature of the instability and the jet flow itself.

predator) spreading via a free boundary. We prove a spreading-vanishing
dichotomy, namely the two species either successfully spread to the entire
space as time $t$ goes to infinity and survive in the new environment, or they
fail to establish and die out in the long run. The long time behavior of
solution and criteria for spreading and vanishing are also obtained. Finally,
when spreading successfully, we provide an estimate to show that the spreading
speed (if exists) cannot be faster than the minimal speed of traveling
wavefront solutions for the prey-predator model on the whole real line without
a free boundary.

collisions, determine the functional form of diffusion coefficients, and show
the existence of two global unstable modes in the particle phase. These modes
have spiral patterns with the azimuthal wavenumber $m=1$ and rotate slowly. We
show that in ring-shaped disks, the phase space density of solid particles
increases linearly in time towards an accumulation point near the location of
pressure maximum, while instabilities grow exponentially. Therefore,
planetesimals and planetary cores can be efficiently produced near the peaks of
unstable density waves. In this mechanism, particles migrating towards the
accumulation point will not participate in the formation of planets, and should
eventually form a debris ring like the main asteroid belt or classical Kuiper
belt objects. We present the implications of global instabilities to the
formation of ice giants and terrestrial planets in the solar system.

for the vortex pump, we do not employ an additional optical potential to trap
the condensate in the radial direction, but instead, the radial confinement is
provided by the magnetic field throughout the pumping cycle. By performing
numerical simulations based on the spin-1 Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we find
that several pumping cycles can be carried out to produce a highly charged
vortex before a majority of the particles escape from the trap or before the
vortex splits into singly charged vortices. On the other hand, we observe that
an additional, relatively weak optical plug potential is efficient in
preventing splitting and reducing particle loss. With these results, we hope to
bring the vortex pump closer to experimental realization.

wavelength range between 3650-9800\AA. It was built on the basis of the common
design for Echelle spectrographs. Its main aim is to measure radial velocities
of stellar objects up to $V\sim$13-14 mag with a precision as good as a few
tens of $m s^{-1}$. To achieve this goal the design was simplified at maximum,
removing all possible movable components, the central wavelength is fixed, so
the wavelentgth coverage; no filter wheel, one slit and so on, with a
particular care taken in the thermal and mechanical stability. The instrument
is fully operational and publically accessible at the 2.2m telescope of the
Calar Alto Observatory.

types of galaxies as a function of stellar mass and redshift. We find that most
z=2-4 star-forming galaxies with M_*>10^10 M_Sun evolve into red-sequence
galaxies. Also, most of the massive galaxies on the red-sequence today have
passed through a phase of intense star formation at z>2. Specifically, ~ 90% of
today's red galaxies with M_*>10^11 M_Sun were fed during this phase by cold
streams including minor mergers. Gas-rich major mergers are rare and the
effects of merger-driven starbursts are ephemeral. On the other hand, major
mergers are important in powering the most extreme starbursts. Gas-rich mergers
also explain the tail of intermediate-mass red galaxies that form relatively
late, after the epoch of peak star formation. In two thirds of the currently
red galaxies that had an intense star formation event at $z<1$, this event was
triggered by a merger.

example, of those of the European Union in year 2006 and 2008. Hence, the
formula is more general than the well known that of Yakovenko et al. That is,
our formula well describes not only two regions but simultaneously the third
region in the plot of the complementary cumulative distribution function vs. an
annual household income. Furthermore, the known stylised facts concerning this
income are well described by our formula. Namely, the formula provides the
Boltzmann-Gibbs income distribution function for the low-income society class
and the weak Pareto law for the medium-income society class, as expected.
Importantly, it predicts (to satisfactory approximation) the Zipf law for the
high-income society class. Moreover, the region of medium-income society class
is now distinctly reduced because the bottom of high-income society class is
distinctly lowered. This reduction made, in fact, the medium-income society

interact with at least one social Web platform, which implies studying the
related API specifications. These are often only informally described, may
contain errors, lack harmonization, and generally speaking make the developer's
work difficult. Most attempts to solve this problem, proposing formal
description languages for Web service APIs, have had limited success outside of
B2B applications; we believe it is due to their top-down nature. In addition, a
programmer dealing with one or several of these APIs has to deal with a number
of related tasks such as data integration, requests chaining, or policy
management, that are cumbersome to implement. Inspired by the SPORE project, we
present API Blender, an open-source solution to describe, interact with, and
integrate the most common social Web APIs. In this perspective, we first
introduce two new lightweight description formats for requests and services and
demonstrate their relevance with respect to current platform APIs. We present
our Python implementation of API Blender and its features regarding
authentication, policy management and multi-platform data integration.

with recent arguments on condensates and confinement.

Jurassic-Cretaceous intraplate rift zone between the African and South American
plates during the final breakup of western Gondwana. By quantitatively
accounting for crustal deformation in the Central and West African rift zone,
we indirectly construct the kinematic history of the pre-breakup evolution of
the conjugate West African-Brazilian margins. Our model suggests a causal link
between changes in extension direction and velocity during continental
extension and the generation of marginal structures such as the enigmatic
Pre-salt sag basin and the S\~ao Paulo High. We model an initial E-W directed
extension between South America and Africa (fixed in present-day position) at
very low extensional velocities until Upper Hauterivian times ($\approx$126 Ma)
when rift activity along in the equatorial Atlantic domain started to increase
significantly. During this initial $\approx$17 Myr-long stretching episode the
Pre-salt basin width on the conjugate Brazilian and West African margins is
generated. An intermediate stage between 126.57 Ma and Base Aptian is
characterised by strain localisation, rapid lithospheric weakening in the
equatorial Atlantic domain, resulting in both progressively increasing
extensional velocities as well as a significant rotation of the extension
direction to NE-SW. Final breakup between South America and Africa occurred in
the conjugate Santos--Benguela margin segment at around 113 Ma and in the
Equatorial Atlantic domain between the Ghanaian Ridge and the Piau\'i-Cear\'a
margin at 103 Ma. We conclude that such a multi-velocity, multi-directional
rift history exerts primary control on the evolution of this conjugate passive
margins systems and can explain the first order tectonic structures along the
South Atlantic and possibly other passive margins.

-25.2deg), relatively away from the Galactic plane. Swift/XRT follow-up
observations identified it with a previously uncatalogued bright X-ray source
and led to optical identification. For more than one year since its appearance,
MAXI J0556-332 has been X-ray active, with a 2-10 keV intensity above 30 mCrab.
The MAXI/GSC data revealed rapid X-ray brightening in the first five days, and
a hard-to-soft transition in the meantime. For the following ~ 70 days, the
0.5-30 keV spectra, obtained by the Swift/XRT and the RXTE/PCA on an almost
daily basis, show a gradual hardening, with large flux variability. These
spectra are approximated by a cutoff power-law with a photon index of 0.4-1 and
a high-energy exponential cutoff at 1.5-5 keV, throughout the initial 10 months
where the spectral evolution is mainly represented by a change of the cutoff
energy. To be more physical, the spectra are consistently explained by thermal
emission from an accretion disk plus a Comptonized emission from a boundary
layer around a neutron star. This supports the source identification as a
neutron-star X-ray binary. The obtained spectral parameters agree with those of
neutron-star X-ray binaries in the soft state, whose luminosity is higher than
1.8x10^37 erg s^-1. This suggests a source distance of >17 kpc.

main tether of an electric solar wind sail (E-sail) so that one can actively
manage the tethers to avoid their mutual collisions and to modify the spin rate
of the sail if needed. This enables a more scalable and modular E-sail than the
baseline approach where auxiliary tethers are used for collision avoidance. For
purely photonic sail applications one can remove the tethers and increase the
size of the blades to obtain a novel variant of the heliogyro that can have a
significantly higher packing density than the traditional heliogyro. For
satellite deorbiting in low Earth orbit (LEO) conditions, analogous designs
exist where the E-sail effect is replaced by the negative polarity plasma brake
effect and the photonic pressure by atmospheric drag. We conclude that the FGPB

method such that the most expensive operations are still performed in a block
fashion. The benefit of using the band Lanczos method is that one can detect
breakdowns from scalar values arising in the computation, allowing for a
handling of breakdown which is straightforward to implement.
  We derive a progressive formulation of the MINRES method based on the band
Lanczos process and give some implementation details. Specifically, a simple
reordering of the steps allows us to perform many of the operations at the
block level in order to take advantage of communication efficiencies offered by
the block Lanczos process. This is an important concern in the context of
next-generation super computing applications.
  We also present a technique allowing us to maintain the block size by
replacing dependent Lanczos vectors with pregenerated random vectors whose
orthogonality against all Lanczos vectors is maintained. Numerical results
illustrate the performance on some sample problems. We present experiments that
show how the relationship between right-hand sides can effect the performance

frustration is responsible for a variety of magnetization scenarios with up to
three or four intermediate magnetization plateaus of either quantum or

breaking operators for equivariant vector bundles over two homogeneous spaces

connection with branching problems of the restriction of representations. We
develop a new method (F-method) based on the algebraic Fourier transform for
generalized Verma modules, which characterizes differential symmetry breaking
operators by means of certain systems of partial differential equations. In
contrast to the setting of real flag varieties, continuous symmetry breaking
operators of Hermitian symmetric spaces are proved to be differential operators

characterized by differential equations of second order via the F-method.
  Part II. Rankin--Cohen brackets are symmetry breaking operators for the
tensor product of two holomorphic discrete series representations of SL(2,R).
We address a general problem to find explicit formulae for such intertwining

breaking operators for all the six different complex geometries arising from
semisimple symmetric pairs of split rank one, and reveal an intrinsic reason

symmetry breaking operators in the other three cases. Further, we analyze a new
phenomenon that the multiplicities in the branching laws of Verma modules may

modules for X-ray telescopes and in synchrotron and FEL (Free Electron Laser)
beamlines. A degradation of the focus sharpness arises in general from
geometrical deformations and surface roughness, the former usually described by
geometrical optics and the latter by physical optics. In general, technological
developments are aimed at a very tight focusing, which requires the mirror
profile to comply with the nominal shape as much as possible and to keep the
roughness at a negligible level. However, a deliberate deformation of the
mirror can be made to endow the focus with a desired size and distribution, via
piezo actuators as done at the EIS-TIMEX beamline of FERMI@Elettra. The
resulting profile can be characterized with a Long Trace Profilometer and
correlated with the expected optical quality via a wavefront propagation code.
However, if the roughness contribution can be neglected, the computation can be
performed via a ray-tracing routine, and, under opportune assumptions, the
focal spot profile (the Point Spread Function, PSF) can even be predicted
analytically. The advantage of this approach is that the analytical relation
can be reversed; i.e, from the desired PSF the required mirror profile can be
computed easily, thereby avoiding the use of complex and time-consuming
numerical codes. The method can also be suited in the case of spatially
inhomogeneous beam intensities, as commonly experienced at Synchrotrons and
FELs. In this work we expose the analytical method and the application to the
beam shaping problem.

low-energy data support for the top-BESS model as well as its low-energy free
parameter limits. The top-BESS model is an effective Lagrangian, a modification
of the well-known BESS model, with an ambition to describe phenomenology of the
lowest bound states of strongly-interacting theories beyond the Standard model.
In particular, the SU(2)_{L+R} vector resonance triplet of hypothetical bound
states is a centerpiece of BESS-like effective models. The top-BESS model
assumes that the triplet couples directly to the third quark generation only.
This assumption reflects a possible special standing of the third quark
generation, and the top quark in particular, in physics of electroweak symmetry
breaking. Our findings suggest that the 125 GeV scalar extension of the
top-BESS model results in a higher statistical support for the model. The

This versatile, low threshold, broad energy range system has been built to
measure the energy, emission angle, and isotopic composition of light charged
reaction products. It consists of 38 independent modules which can be arranged
in an arbitrary configuration. A single module, covering actively about 4.5 msr
of the solid angle at the optimal distance of 40 cm from the target, consists
of three identical, 0.500 mm thick, large area photodiodes, used also for
direct detection, and of two CsI(1500 ppm Tl) crystals of 2.5 and 12.5 cm
length, respectively. All the signals are digitally processed. The lower
identification threshold, due to the thickness of the first photodiode, has
been reduced to about 2.5 MeV for protons (~0.065 mm of Si equivalent) by
applying a pulse shape analysis. The pulse shape analysis allowed also to
decompose the complex signals from the middle photodiode into their ionization
and scintillation components and to obtain a satisfactory isotopic resolution
with a single readout channel. The upper energy limit for protons is about 260
MeV. The whole setup is easily portable. It performed very well during the
ASY-EOS experiment, conducted in May 2011 at GSI. The structure and performance
of the array are described using the results of Au+Au collisions at 400
MeV/nucleon obtained in this experiment.

by hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy so far. Multiple-peak analysis
revealed that the Mn4+ spectral weight was not proportional to the nominal hole
concentration x, indicating that a simple Mn3+/Mn4+ intensity ratio analysis
may result in a wrong quantitative elemental analysis. Considerable weight of
the shoulder at x=0.0 and the fact that the shoulder weight was even slightly
going down from x=0.2 to 0.4 were not compatible with the idea that this weight
simply represents the metallic behavior. Further analysis found that the whole
Mn 2p3/2 peak can be decomposed into four portions, the Mn4+, the (nominal)
Mn3+, the shoulder, and the other spectral weight located almost at the Mn3+
location. We concluded that this weight represents the well-screened final
state at Mn4+ sites, whereas the shoulder is known as that of the Mn3+ states.

sample of AGB stars of different chemical type is presented. The data are
analysed and circumstellar HCN abundances are estimated. The sample stars span
a large range of properties such as mass-loss rate and photospheric C/O-ratio.
The analysis of the new data allows for more accurate estimates of the
circumstellar HCN abundances and puts new constraints on chemical models. In
order to constrain the circumstellar HCN abundance distribution a detailed
non-LTE excitation analysis, based on the Monte Carlo method, is performed.
Effects of line overlaps and radiative excitation from dust grains are
included. The median values for the derived abundances of HCN (with respect to
H2) are 3x10-5, 7x10-7 and 10-7 for carbon stars (25 stars), S-type AGB stars
(19 stars) and M-type AGB stars (25 stars), respectively. The estimated sizes
of the HCN envelopes are similar to those obtained in the case of SiO for the
same sample of sources and agree well with previous results from
interferometric observations, when these are available. We find that there is a
clear dependence of the derived circumstellar HCN abundance on the C/O-ratio of
the star, in that carbon stars have about two orders of magnitude higher
abundances than M-type AGB stars, on average. The derived HCN abundances of the
S-type AGB stars have a larger spread and typically fall in between those of
the two other types, however, slightly closer to the values for the M-type AGB
stars. For the M-type stars, the estimated abundances are much higher than what
would be expected if HCN is formed in thermal equilibrium. However, the results
are also in contrast to predictions from recent non-LTE chemical models, where
very little difference is expected in the HCN abundances between the various
types of AGB stars.

extends this to all cluster variables by mutation. The resulting grading has
the property that every (quantum) cluster variable is homogeneous.

high velocity regime, including reasonable micro-branching. As far as the
physical properties such as the structure factor $g(r)$, the radial or angular
distributions, these lattices share the physical properties of perfect lattices
rather than that of an amorphous material (e.g., the continuous random network
model). A clear transition can be seen between steady-state cracks, where a
single crack propagates in the midline of the sample and the regime of unstable
cracks, where micro-branches start to appear near the main crack, in line with
previous experimental results. This is seen both in a honeycomb lattice and a
fully hexagonal lattice. This model reproduces the main physical features of
propagating cracks in brittle materials, including the behavior of velocity as
a function of driving displacement and the increasing amplitude of oscillations
of the electrical resistance. In addition, preliminary indications of power-law

the abundances of a large variety of alpha, p-capture, iron-peak, and n-capture

dex, typical of most GCs of similar luminosity. We detected significant

populations. Additionally, the two most Na-rich stars are also significantly
Ba-enhanced, indicating a fourth population of stars. Curiously, most stars in
M 75 (excluding the two Ba-rich stars) show a predominant r-process enrichment

Markov decision processes and dynamic decision networks to learn from clinical
data and develop complex plans via simulation of alternative sequential
decision paths while capturing the sometimes conflicting, sometimes synergistic
interactions of various components in the healthcare system. It can operate in
partially observable environments (in the case of missing observations or data)
by maintaining belief states about patient health status and functions as an
online agent that plans and re-plans. This framework was evaluated using real
patient data from an electronic health record. Such an AI framework easily
outperforms the current treatment-as-usual (TAU) case-rate/fee-for-service
models of healthcare (Cost per Unit Change: $189 vs. $497) while obtaining a
30-35% increase in patient outcomes. Tweaking certain model parameters further
enhances this advantage, obtaining roughly 50% more improvement for roughly
half the costs. Given careful design and problem formulation, an AI simulation
framework can approximate optimal decisions even in complex and uncertain
environments. Future work is described that outlines potential lines of
research and integration of machine learning algorithms for personalized

early-type galaxies (ETG) in the Virgo cluster, extending also to the dwarf
ETG, and examine the results in relation with those on the other cold ISM
components. Methods. We searched for far-infrared emission in all galaxies of
the input sample using the 250 micron image of the Herschel Virgo Cluster
Survey (HeViCS). This image covers a large fraction of the cluster. For the
detected ETG we measured fluxes in 5 bands from 100 to 500 micron, and
estimated the dust mass and temperature with modified black-body fits. Results.
Dust is detected above the completeness limit of 25.4 mJy at 250 micron in 46
ETG, 43 of which are in the optically complete part of the input sample. In
addition dust is present at fainter levels in another 6 ETG. We detect dust in
the 4 ETG with synchrotron emission, including M 87. Dust appears to be much
more concentrated than stars and more luminous ETG have higher dust
temperatures. Dust detection rates down to the 25.4 mJy limit are 17% for
ellipticals, about 40% for lenticulars (S0 + S0a) and around 3% for dwarf ETG.
Dust mass does not correlate clearly with stellar mass and is often much more
than that expected for a passive galaxy in a closed-box model. The
dust-to-stars mass ratio anticorrelates with galaxy luminosity, and for some
dwarf ETG reaches values as high as for dusty late-type galaxies. In the Virgo
cluster slow rotators appear more likely to contain dust than fast ones.
Comparing the dust results with those on HI from ALFALFA, there are only 8 ETG
detected both in dust and in HI in the HeViCS area; 39 have dust but only an
upper limit on HI, and 8 have HI but only an upper limit on dust. The locations
of these galaxies in the cluster are different, with the dusty ETG concentrated
in the densest regions, while the HI rich ETG are at the periphery.

commonly used in a wide range of applications. However, model-based clustering
methods for categorical data are less standard. Latent class analysis is a
commonly used method for model-based clustering of binary data and/or
categorical data, but due to an assumed local independence structure there may
not be a correspondence between the estimated latent classes and groups in the
population of interest. The mixture of latent trait analyzers model extends
latent class analysis by assuming a model for the categorical response
variables that depends on both a categorical latent class and a continuous
latent trait variable; the discrete latent class accommodates group structure
and the continuous latent trait accommodates dependence within these groups.
Fitting the mixture of latent trait analyzers model is potentially difficult
because the likelihood function involves an integral that cannot be evaluated
analytically. We develop a variational approach for fitting the mixture of
latent trait models and this provides an efficient model fitting strategy. The
mixture of latent trait analyzers model is demonstrated on the analysis of data
from the National Long Term Care Survey (NLTCS) and voting in the U.S.
Congress. The model is shown to yield intuitive clustering results and it gives
a much better fit than either latent class analysis or latent trait analysis
alone.

existing transform domain techniques.

Banach space. The well known technique of comparing volumes gives upper and
lower bounds on covering numbers. This technique does not provide a
construction of good coverings. Here we apply incoherent dictionaries for
construction of good coverings. We use the following strategy. First, we build
a good covering by balls with a radius close to one. Second, we iterate this
construction to obtain a good covering for any radius. We mostly concentrate on
the first step of this strategy.

newspapers, in courtrooms, and all over the Internet. We are exposed to them
throughout the day and most of the time. Ease with which images can be
manipulated; we need to be aware that seeing does not always imply believing.
We propose methodologies to identify such unbelievable photo images and
succeeded to identify forged region by given only the forged image. Formats are
additive tag for every file system and contents are relatively expressed with
extension based on most popular digital camera uses JPEG and Other image
formats like png, bmp etc. We have designed algorithm running behind with the
concept of abnormal anomalies and identify the forgery regions.
